It lies about halfway between Swords and Ashbourne. It is located around two parallel roads intersected by a road which crosses the Broad Meadow River by an old cut stone bridge. Rolestown is also a parish in the Fingal North deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. St Bridget's Killossery Church, Rolestown, Swords, Co Dublin Location and access Rolestown lies either side of a flood-plain of the Broadmeadow River Valley. The northern part of the village is located on elevated ground. The area centred on the graveyard, old corn mill, bridge and approach to the gates of Rowlestown House, is characterised by distinctive heritage buildings and mature trees. The settlement is located between the R125, which leads to Oldtown and Garristown, and the R106, which leads to Ballyboughal and the Naul to the north, and Dublin Airport to the south. It lacks a core as it is mostly a townland and consists primarily of ribbon development, mainly one-off housing in the form of bungalows. Community structure Traditionally, the Rolestown area has a distinct relationship with the town of Swords, located 7 km away. Many of the local council housing estates built in the Swords area were used to house families from the Rolestown/Kilsallaghan area. Most Rolestown families send their children to secondary schools in Swords, and many Swords residents play Gaelic football for Fingal Ravens GFC in Rolestown. In the Roman Catholic Church, the parish of is part of a team ministry with Garristown and The Naul.Official website of Dublin Archdiocese - Fingal North deanery History Rolestown originated as a small river settlement at a crossing point of the Broadmeadow River several hundred years ago. The 1658 census of Ireland recorded 41 inhabitants of Rolestown (of 120 persons in the Clonmethan area, which included Rowlestown). Around 1700, lands were given to the Catholic Church for a chapel, garden and paddock. The 1837 (First Edition) Ordnance Survey Map indicated that the village had grown sufficiently for a National School to be constructed on the edge of the village. The church called Killossery (the church of St. Ossier in Irish) was built near the banks of the river in the seventeenth century. The parish of Killossery consisted of 2500 acres (10 km¬≤) and over 380 inhabitants in the nineteenth century. The parish was so large at one point that it included all of Rolestown and Lispopple. The current church (pictured above) is named St. Brigid's Church and was built in the 1850s, and had some extensive repair work done in the late 1990s. The Big House (Rowlestown House) originally belonged to the Corbally family since to the Griffin family. The old castle in Killsallaghlan, an area of Rolestown, is surrounded by a wood, hence its name Coill Saileach√°in (the Sally Wood). The castle was destroyed in 1641. The oldest still functioning building in the area appears to be Rowlestown House which was constructed in the Goergian style between 1750 and 1770 and is still used as a dwelling as of 2020. Education Rolestown only has a National School, a primary school for 4 to 12/13-year-old children. The original old school building excluding prefabricated classrooms was originally built to accommodate the immediate area of Rolestown/Kilsallaghan. Local businessman, Pat McDonagh, sponsored the building of a new school building to replace the old school. The school has students from several different peripheral towns and villages such as Greenogue, Swords, Ballyboughal and Oldtown. Resources There is no public open space currently provided in the village. The primary school has a small junior playing field and a hard surface basketball court to the side of the building. In the surrounding area there are a number of private leisure facilities, including a GAA pitch and club house. In the local area there is also a bar/pub with an adjoining restaurant and hotel but this is not located within the village center. There is a church hall which hosts classes on drama, badminton, Tae Kwon Do, soccer, creche services, traditional Irish dancing and other local community activities like the local Catholic church committee meetings, Irish Countrywomen's Association (I.C.A.) meetings and local fund-raisers such as the sale-of-work and several cake sales throughout the year. A historical association was formed in the past few years with the purpose of documenting the history of the parish and area. The drama society puts on a traditional pantomime every year in mid-January. A Maxol petrol/service station was opened to replace an old service station which closed down around the early 2000s. The site which was developed for this now also has a small business centre. Sport Fingal Ravens is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Rolestown Cho's Tae Kwon-Do is also based locally.http://www.aimaaeuropehq.com/Contact%20Us.htm Public transport The 41B Dublin Bus Service serves Rolestown.http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your- Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/41b/ The bus goes from Dublin city centre through Dublin Airport and Swords, Dublin, terminating at Rolestown Bridge. There are no other public transport services passing through or running close to the village. Gates leading to earlier driveway and lawns of Rowlestown House Lawn Gates At the end of the T-junction (after crossing Rolestown Bridge which goes over The Broad Meadow stream towards the local hall) a pair of old white gates lie at the entrance to the original house driveway and a field. This field runs on the east side the aforementioned Rolestown House. Here, up until the late 1950s and early 1960s, carnivals were held each year. These included sheep-shearing competitions, sheepdog trials and fancy-dress competitions. The carnival was lit with lights going all the way up the field to a large marquee-style tent where at the end of the carnival a dance would be held at night.

The town is northwest of Norwich.Towns and villages of Broadland Retrieved 17 November 2008 At the time of the 2001 census the civil parish (including Pettywell) had a population of 2,455 residents in 970 households, occupying an area of .2001 Census Retrieved 17 November 2008 increasing to a population of 2,709 in 1,169 househoids at the 2011 census. History The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, in which it is listed as Refham meaning the bailiff's or reeve's manor from the Old English gerafa (bailiff) and ham (homestead). Reepham has had market town status since 1277; a sign to mark this has recently been erected. The town has undergone significant development throughout its life, with the housing in the area showing a mix of vintages, styles and purposes. Today Recent housing developments have mostly been on brownfield land so have not significantly expanded the perimeter of the town. The town has both a secondary school Reepham High School and College, which achieved the highest grade‚ÄîOutstanding‚Äîin every category in its 2008 Ofsted inspection, and a primary school. The Reepham Society is a registered charity, set up in 1976 to stimulate public interest in Reepham, Hackford, Kerdiston, Salle and Whitwell. The town was one of the filming locations of Agatha Christie's Poirot episode The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor. Religion =Twin churches= Reepham is one of only two places in Europe to have three churches on the same site. Reepham's church of St. Mary is joined by its choir vestry to St. Michael‚Äôs, Whitwell. The third church (All Saints') belonged to Hackford but burned down in 1543 and now only a fragment of the tower wall remains on the left of the path leading towards the market place. The three churches were built on their parish boundaries.Betjeman, John, ed. (1968) Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches; the South.

Although it was less famous than the shrine at Walsingham, people came on pilgrimage to Reepham to visit the image of Our Lady of Reepham, which had many miracles attributed to it. What form this image took is unknown. It may have been a statue, or perhaps a wood carving. There is evidence to suggest its importance and it is mentioned in the 15th-century will of Alice Cook of Horstead, who wrote that after her death, in order to smooth her passage from this world to the next, she would \\"Have a man goo a pilgrimage to our Lady of Reifham\\". Town sign The town sign was designed by the local high school and installed in 1992. Carved by the then head of Craft Design & Technology Mr. Geldard, and painted by male student Kerry Daniels, it depicts three of each of the following elements: churches, villagers, farm labourers, sheep, lambs and \\"sisters\\" and refers to a myth that three sisters were each responsible for building a church.

His feastdays are 18 September and 14 December (Orthodox). Life and legacy The Venerable Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History, describes St Hybald as a \\"most holy and continent man who was an abbot in Lindsey\\".Bede 'Ecclesiastical History of the English People' Book 4,[A.D. 669] It is conjectured, in the Dictionary of Christian Biography (1877‚Äì87), that this is the Benedictine abbey at Bardney, then in the old Kingdom of Lindsey, now Lincolnshire. In 679, Osthryth, queen of Mercia, sought to move the remains of her uncle, St Oswald, to Bardney,Catholic Encyclopedia: St Oswald but the monks refused to accept the body because Oswald, as king of Northumbria, had once conquered Lindsey. The remains were locked outside the abbey but the appearance of a mysterious beam of light, that night, led the monks to reconsider. (as ) Hybald was also a friend of Saint Chadd, and, had a prophetic vision of his death. He later, followed Chadd's example and became an hermit. Hybald died around 690, and was buried in the village of Hibaldstow, whose name means place where St Hygbald is buried. Following his canonisation, a shrine was built near his grave to hold his relics, and became a place of pilgrimage. This continued until the English Reformation when the shrine was destroyed. Hybald's body remained undisturbed until it was rediscovered in 1864, when the, then, dilapidated church was rebuilt.

It emphasizes topics of interest to the African-American community, especially in the New Orleans area and south Louisiana. It has an estimated weekly circulation of 6,500. The Louisiana Weekly was established by the C.C. Dejoie family in 1925. The paper has covered social justice issues including \\"education, the environment, politics and protest,\\" including such diverse topics as the Black Panther Party and the threat of hydrofluoric acid contamination at a New Orleans area refinery. The newspaper also has a Spanish-language page aimed at south Louisiana's significant Central American population. The newspaper presently uses the tagline \\"Your Multicultural News Medium\\". Publication of the Louisiana Weekly was interrupted (in print only ) because of the flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina in August and September 2005. Past issues of The Louisiana Weekly are archived by the Amistad Research Center of New Orleans.  History  Founded in 1925 by Orlando Capitola Ward Taylor and Constant C. Dejoie Sr., The Louisiana Weekly is one of the oldest African-American newspapers that is still in circulation. \\"Their vision was to create a newspaper dedicated to the enlightening, ennobling and empowering people of color\\". The newspaper focused on topics that they felt were not getting the attention it deserved. The paper first worked out of the Pythian Temple Building at 234 Loyola Avenue. The first issue, which appeared on September 19, 1925, chronicled the life of educator and singer Professor John Wesley Work. Originally, the paper was called The New Orleans Herald but the name was changed in October. The newspaper sales were increasing as soon as the paper became available. \\"The annual subscription rate of the newspaper was two dollars, with six-month, one-month, and one-issue rates available at $1.25, 20 cents, and five cents, respectively.\\" Even though the newspaper is based in Louisiana, the paper was read worldwide.  People  The Dejoie family was one of the most prominent black families in New Orleans; they owned the Unity Industrial Life Insurance Company. O.C.W. Taylor was a former teacher and principal in the New Orleans Public School system. Mr. Taylor received his bachelor's degree from Wylie College in Texas having distinguished himself with the debate team and a Masters from Columbia University which has, within its oral history project, a tape of Mr. Taylor talking about his experiences at the Louisiana Weekly giving more history and information on that period of time. He also had a television show on WNOE TV, which was about students, teachers and their achievements in the New Orleans Public School system and a radio show on WNOE radio. Besides the Louisiana Weekly, O. C. W. Taylor worked with George Schuyler, a close friend and fellow Mason at the Pittsburgh Courier. The Pittsburgh Couriers first office in the south was in Mr. Taylors home at 1667 North Roman Street. His daughter - Doris Gaynelle Taylor was society editor for the Louisiana Weekly and the Pittsburgh Courier. During O. C. W. Taylors' time at the Louisiana Weekly, which lasted many years, he successfully chaired the papers' Victory Bond sales drive, which met its goal with the help of Taylor's daughter Doris Gaynelle Taylor. Doris, who was named after Doris Zemurray, was the model on the posters showing her picture in the \\"V\\" as O. C. W. and his daughter circulated the city selling the Victory Bonds. Emmanuel Gregoire was also active in the Victory Bond campaign, which was a large event in New Orleans during that period of time. Mr. Taylor, who served as editor of the Louisiana Weekly during its early years, took a leave of absence from his job as teacher and principal with the New Orleans Public School System to work with C. C. Dejoie to bring the paper to a viable place. It was clear after the first year or two that the paper needed someone full-time if this project was going to succeed. Taylors' wife - Marceline Bucksell Taylor - supported the family during that time when money was short because of the sacrifices they decided to make to help the Louisiana Weekly become a substantial publication. Marceline Taylor and C. C. Dejoie's wife- Vivian - were close friends and spent time sewing together for their club, the Circle de Service, so to them it was family bringing in family to move the Louisiana Weekly along to success. O. C. W. brought his brother-in-law, Louis Peter Bucksell, a pharmacist in the city of New Orleans who had three pharmacies around the state, but whose passion was photography, to work with the paper to do much of the needed photography. Since Louis Bucksell had his own photographic development studio his photography was sometimes quite outstanding. L. P. Bucksell took many pictures over the years for the paper to accompany articles and found stories on his own as he traveled around the city and the state to help make the paper a viable institution for the African American Community. Louis Bucksell brought along his son-in-law Emmanuel Gregoire, known to some as \\"Uncle Greggy\\", to work on the paper with his writings and \\"Uncle Greggy\\" did a great deal of the administrative work. Mr. Gregoire was a teacher and principal in the New Orleans Public School System and also wrote and helped manage the Louisiana Weekly for several years. Gregoire, Bucksell and Taylor spent years working without pay to move the paper along to help it find a substantial foundation. C.C. Dejoie helped establish the newspaper with a $2,000 investment and used his business contacts to help spread the paper throughout the city. \\"Joseph ‚ÄúScoop‚Äù Jones, who served as a Louisiana Weekly newsboy, reporter, columnist, and photographer, was considered to be one of the publication's earliest and most talented journalists.\\" After C.C. Dejoie stepped down, his son Henry Sr. took over his father role as publisher of the newspaper in 1965. Henry Sr. left the newspaper because of Hurricane Katrina and was not able to return home before his death.  Content  The Louisiana Weekly has been through multiple different stages of African-American history. The paper wrote about the violence towards black people during World War II. \\"One of the greatest accomplishments was a five-week series that ran in the paper claiming that defense training should be extended to public schools, which was implemented by the Superintendent of Schools after the series ran.\\" The Louisiana Weekly covered issues such as: Brown v. The Board of Education, the Black Power Movement, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, Martin Luther King Jr., W.E.B. DuBois, and the 1963 March on Washington. The paper also covers current events that are happening in the black community. It covers the shooting and injustices in the African-American community. The Louisiana Weekly does not just cover injustices, the newspaper covers sports, business, education, health, tourist advice, and entertainment.  Reputation  \\"The Weekly's emphasis was placed on local, national, and international events that had tremendous effects on us in our struggle as people,\\". The Louisiana Weekly had to move out of New Orleans, LA because of Hurricane Katrina and that caused a slip in the paper's reputation. The paper wrote mostly government blame articles after Hurricane Katrina. \\"The paper was hit hard by the storm, and many of their subscribers dispersed throughout the country, from Atlanta to Los Angeles and New York. Displaced readers have come to depend even more heavily on the Louisiana Weekly for accurate coverage of New Orleans current events.\\" The paper has gone through a tough time since Hurricane Katrina, but The Louisiana Weekly is still seen as one of the most important sources of news in the black community.

From 1859 he accompanied Prince Johann II of Liechtenstein on his voyages throughout Europe. Vogelsang finally settled in Austria in 1864. In 1875, he became editor of the Catholic newspaper Das Vaterland (\\"The Native Country\\") edited by Leo von Thun-Hohenstein. This conservative publication was highly influential on Catholic social teaching, helping to establish the 40-hour work week and national health insurance for workers under the government of Minister-President Eduard Taaffe. Vogelsang died at Vienna in 1890, aged 72. Many of his thoughts found entrance into the 1891 Rerum novarum encyclical issued by Pope Leo XIII. As a social reformer, he was later seen as a precursor by the Austrofascist authoritarian state of the 1930s; he was quoted in the regime's propaganda by its leader, Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss. Antisemitism Vogelsang was the initiator of the rising Christian people's movement in Austria and in some neighboring countries. Since some former members of the antisemitic people's movement of Georg Ritter von Sch√∂nerer (for example the Viennese mayor Karl Lueger) joined Vogelsang, some authors call Vogelsang an antisemite too. But Vogelsang said as well that Christians not only should pray to God but also do good works for the poor so as to be God's people on the side of the Jews, His first chosen and forever beloved people. However, some of Vogelsang's pronouncedly disfavourable remarks about Jews related to his anti-liberal and anti-capitalist views were included by his admirer, the once Austrofascist and later European federalist who survived the Buchenwald concentration camp, Eugen Kogon, in a volume entitled \\"Catholic-Conservative Heritage\\" which called for the establishment of a Catholic Third Reich and was edited by the Benedictine abbot of Maria Laach, , in 1934, to be distributed to a large share of Catholic households in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland by the Herder publishing house. Many of the people who gathered into Vogelsang's movement, established the Christian Social Party in 1893, and some successors like developed strong antisemitic views. Another group of followers like Karl Lugmayer, Irene Harand, Pater , (Sociologist and Vice-mayor of Vienna, who in 1938 emigrated to USA), and Hildegard Burjan, understood Vogelsang's thoughts as laying stress on social questions. They, like some other Christians, strained to help the poor and to establish new social laws, but they also tried to change people's minds and to help persecuted Jews, before and during the Nazi period.

The station opened in June 1937, replacing the two previous Wellington termini, Lambton and Thorndon.  History  Entrance to Wellington Railway Station in 2006. = Development = The capital's first Wellington railway station was a group of small buildings at Pipitea Point built in 1874 on earthquake-raised harbour floor for a temporary terminus of the railway line to the Hutt Valley. A series of reclamations allowed the line to reach well down Featherston Street and in 1880 a new Wellington railway station was, as it turned out, temporarily placed near the goods station for the new Railway Wharf. Traffic at the wharf quickly grew beyond expectations. The 1880 building was pulled north on rollers in 1885 to a less congested site on Featherston Street opposite the junction of Mulgrave Street and Sydney Street now Kate Sheppard Place. The third site named Wellington railway station was only the passenger terminus for the Hutt and Wairarapa lines. After the Government took control of the Manawatu line in December 1908, the Wellington railway station was renamed Wellington Lambton station and the Manawatu station which became the terminus for the North Island Main Trunk was named Wellington Thorndon station. The Thorndon station had been opened in September 1885 by the private Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company. The Government bought the line from its shareholders in 1908 to incorporate the Manawatu line into their system. Once both stations were in government control, public pressure began to build for a single terminal. In 1908, a joint reclamation scheme was drawn up by the Railways Department and the Wellington Harbour Board and in 1912 a new railway station was proposed, to supersede the Lambton and Thorndon stations. The government decided on a co-ordinated development that included a new station building, and after agreement in 1922 between the Railways Department and the Wellington Harbour Board, the reclamation of about 68 acres (27 hectares) incorporating a new double-track line, train marshalling areas, goods yards and sheds and using fill from the Tawa Flat Deviation. The Thorndon reclamation began in 1923 and was on track to be completed by 1932, which allowing the government in 1929 to confirm in 1929 that Bunny Street would be the location of a new station, so removing the inconvenience of two separate stations. thumb In 1929, W. Gray Young,an architect known for his neo-Georgian styles, of Wellington architectural firm of Gray Young, Morton & Young, was selected (without a design competition) to design the new station, over the Auckland firm of Gummer & Ford, which had designed Auckland railway station. Gray Young, Morton and Young was formed in 1923 and consisted of William Gray Young, Hubert Morton and Gray Young's brother Jack. The firm had recently finished large commissions for Victoria University, designing the Stout Building (1930) and Weir House (1930), and later the Kirk Building (1938). The need to review building techniques after the Napier earthquake and the impact of the Depression on finances delayed the government formally committing to the project until June 1933. = Design = As the planned location was on reclaimed land, test piles were driven in 1928 to test the quality of soil. On the basis of the test results the decision was made to use Vibro cast-in-place piles to support the structure. The building was the first major New Zealand structure to incorporate a significant measure of earthquake resistance. Gray Young was paid a 4% fee based on the originally estimated cost of ¬£470,000. This cost rose to ¬£483,000 once the quantity surveying firm of Maltby & Sommerville compiled a detailed quantity schedule, for which they were paid 1% of the estimated cost. Because of the impact of the Depression on Government finances it was decided to reduce the cost by eliminating a mailroom and a section of the West wing along Featherston Street and by transferring the ¬£28,000 cost of the platforms and verandahs to a separate budget. As a result, the official estimated cost of the station was reduced to ¬£350,000. To encourage employment of workers out of work due to the Depression the project received a subsidy of ¬£34,000 (10% of the estimated cost) from the Employment Board. The building is a U-shaped structure with the longest leg 105.5 metres [346 feet] long and 23.5 metres [77 feet] high. Because of delays in importing the specialized boring equipment needed to install the cast-in-place piles called for in the original design, the decision was made to use 1615 15 x 15 inch and 16 x 16 inch reinforced concrete piles. These were driven by a steam- powered hammer. On top of the piles a five- and six-storey steel-framed structure was built. The steel was encased in reinforced concrete and 1.75 million bricks. 21,000 cubic yards of aggregate from the Hutt River with cement from Whangarei were mixed on site to create the concrete. The bricks used for the outer cladding were of a special design, with slots to accommodate vertical corrosion‚Äìresistant steel rods that reinforced the brickwork and bound it to the structural members. 1500 tons of decorative Hanmer and Whangarei granite and marble were used to clad the interior and the entranceway. 2500 gallons of paint were used. The roof was clad in Marseille tiles. The main entrance is on the south side via a colonnade of eight 13-metre- [42-foot]-high Doric columns opening into a large booking hall decorated with delicately mottled dados extending to a high vaulted ceiling. The glazed-roof concourse contained waiting rooms and toilets, a large dining room, a barber shop, book and fruit stalls and a first aid room. There was a nursery on the top floor to allow parents to leave their children while they shopped or waited for their train. Road Services buses at Platform 9 in 1957 When completed the station was New Zealand‚Äôs largest building, partly covering 0.6 hectares and with a combined floor area of two hectares. It was designed to accommodate the 675 staff of the Railways Department head office and the Wellington district office, which until then had been accommodated in 11 leased buildings throughout the city. The platforms, designed to accommodate up to 12 carriages, are made of concrete covered with a sealed surface under verandahs held up by railway irons. Platform 9 was designed to be a roadway without rails for the terminus for certain services provided by New Zealand Railways Road Services. A park was created in the forecourt with lawns and paths of paving stones with brick edging arranged in a herringbone pattern. = Construction = The construction tender closed on 25 September 1933, extended by two weeks in an attempt to encourage local manufacturers to offer locally manufactured materials. Twelve tenders were received, with Fletcher Building the lowest at ¬£339,000. The next lowest was ¬£350,000 from J T Julian & Son, who had constructed a significant part of the Auckland railway station. Fletchers was awarded what was believed to be the largest single-building contract let in New Zealand up to that time, to which a performance bond of ¬£3000 was applied. Fletchers appointed 26-year-old Joe Craig to manage his first major project. His prior experience had been on the construction of Chateau Tongariro, Massey College and earthquake reconstruction in Hastings. His management skills, supported by a large team of experienced foremen and a close working relationship with the architect, ensured that construction progressed very smoothly on a project that was very profitable for Fletchers. Work commenced on site on January 1934 with a workforce of 12, which built up to 161 in January 1936. Fletchers reduced the cost of the construction steel to ¬£70,000 from an estimated ¬£85,000 by directly importing it rather than purchasing it from local steel merchants, and had it fabricated on site by Wm Cable Ltd. Progress was rapid, with 1500 of the piles driven by the time the foundation stone was laid on 17 December 1934 by the Duke of Gloucester, an occasion witnessed by an estimated 5000 people. The contract was expanded to include the construction of an electric substation (commenced 1936) at a cost of ¬£2022 and a locomotive maintenance workshop (commenced 1936) along the Thorndon Quay side of the railway yard. This cost ¬£37,406 and is still in use. In August 1938, to accommodate increasing staff numbers, work commenced on the construction of the section of the Featherston Street Wing removed from the original design to reduce its cost. This was undertaken as a separate project at a cost of ¬£59,662. A two-storey brick building with a mansard roof containing a social hall and a garage was built in 1937 facing Waterloo Quay to the north of the East wing, at a cost of ¬£15,000. The garage was on the ground floor with the social hall occupying part of the ground floor and the entire first storey. The garage also incorporated rooms for the chauffeur to the Railways Departments General Manager.  Wellington railway yard  The Wellington railway yard incorporates marshalling and storage tracks and buildings and a Multiple Unit Depot (MUD) for servicing EMUs. A rail line under the overhead stadium walkway goes to the container terminal and other freight facilities on the Port wharves, with a level crossing on Aotea Quay. The principal Wellington signal box known as the \\"A Box\\" is near the overhead stadium walkway with a commanding view of the station platforms and main lines entering the station. In 2021/2022 additional crossovers and connections to the station approaches will provide extra capacity and resilience ($4.5 million) and the signal interlocking may be replaced with a computer based system ($8 million). A second lead track is to be provided to the train storage yards to facilitate faster platform clearance (2020; $5.9 million). When a derailed goods wagon near the Interisland terminal damaged both tracks through the yard out of Wellington on 3 July 2019 commuter service to the Hutt Valley and Kapiti lines were seriously disrupted for two days. The closed Kaiwharawhara railway station is to be developed as an emergency Wellington terminal.  Use  Wellington railway station's booking hall in 2013. The station was opened on 19 June 1937 by the Governor-General of New Zealand, Viscount Galway. Lambton closed on 19 June 1937 and Thorndon on 8 June 1937. In 1982, the New Zealand Railways Corporation replaced the Railways Department. The application of a more commercial attitude to the running of the organization resulted in a large reduction in staff employed at the Wellington railway station. Due to the reduction of railway staff numbers in the 1980s, large parts of the building became underutilised. In 1988, the Railways-run bookstall and cafeteria were closed with subsequently the barber's shop and men's toilets being converted into 'Trax Bar and Cafe', while the women's waiting rooms were converted into toilet blocks. The original dining hall and kitchen were converted to office space. At about this time platforms 2 to 7 were shortened at the concourse end to provide increased space for waiting passengers. Large concrete planter boxes were installed at the end of the tracks to assist in stopping runaway trains. As part of the creation of the WestpacTrust Stadium (completed November 1999) on surplus railway land to the north of the station, an elevated walkway from Thorndon Quay to the stadium was installed with access via ramps from platforms 3/4, 5/6 and 7/8. To facilitate this work, the canopies of platforms 7/8 and 9 were shortened to the same length as platforms 3/4 and 5/6. In 1991, as a result of a major restructuring of the New Zealand Railways Corporation, ownership of the land and buildings was retained by the Railways Corporation while a new organisation known as New Zealand Rail Limited took over rail operations including freight distribution, commuter and long-distance passenger services and the Interisland ferry service. Both organisations retained offices in the building. In 1993, New Zealand Rail Limited was sold to a private business consortium, which became Tranz Rail Holdings Limited in 1995. In 2000, Tranz Rail moved to its head office to Auckland but retained space for operational management of the railway network. In 2004, Tranz Rail was sold and renamed Toll NZ Ltd, which then sold the track and infrastructure back to the Railways Corporation. Between August 2003 and October 2008, the building was refurbished at a cost of NZ$14.6 million to house part of Victoria University in the West wing and Toll NZ (now KiwiRail) in the East wing. This work included a seismic upgrade, restoration and refurbishment, and installing three new lifts and dedicated access in the south-west corner to the university wing from the concourse. The architect was Athfield Architects with construction undertaken by Fletcher Construction. As part of this reorganization of the building, the 24-hour train control centre was relocated from the western wing to the eastern side of the southern part of the building. Station concourse in 2016, following a recent upgrade. On 4 December 2006, the New World Railway Metro supermarket opened on the ground floor. This coincided with the closure of the Railway Kiosk and the American Hotdog vendor. In 2010, the former social hall was converted into 660 square metres of boutique office space. The station was registered on 25 September 1986 as a Category I Historic Place. In August 2018, the proposed sale of the building by KiwiRail was stopped by Winston Peters the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises as \\"premature\\". The building requires earthquake strengthening (cost $62 million), and the anticipated sale price of $80 million had already been included in KiwiRail's budget. The Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust decided not to purchase the building in 2016. = World War I Roll of Honour = Railways Department roll of honour board In the office entrance to the station, a roll of honour lists 450 members of the New Zealand Railways Department who lost their lives in World War I. (Transcript of the names with links to their records on the Auckland War Memorial Museum's Cenotaph database.) As many as 5,000 of the department's permanent staff, out of a 1914 workforce of 14,000, enlisted during the war, and many casual workers also served. The roll was unveiled by Prime Minister William Massey in the Railways Department's head office in Featherston St on 30 April 1922. It originally listed 446 names, including two out of alphabetical order at the end, presumably late additions. Four names were added later, including those of three men who died after the war. When the station opened in 1937, the memorial was moved along the road to its present location. = Filming location = Wellington railway station featured prominently in the 1981 film Goodbye Pork Pie, in which the protagonists drive a Mini through the station concourse in order to escape pursuing police officers. The station was used in a 2009 TV advert in the United Kingdom for train ticketing company TheTrainLine, where a large flock of sheep use the facilities. In May 2014, the station foyer was used by celebrity chef Nigella Lawson to film a commercial for Whittaker's a local chocolate manufacturing firm. = Airspace development = In 1972, NZR proposed developing the airspace above the station's platforms. The proposed development included four buildings built north of the current station over the platforms and part of the marshaling yards. The development would include a 200-bed hotel, tavern, car-parking, shopping facilities and a revolving restaurant. NZR made an application to Wellington City Council for consent to begin the project in 1977.  Head Office and occupants  The Railways Head office had been combined in an ornate three-story brick building at 75 Featherston Street in 1903. The foundation stone was laid by the Duke of Cornwall (later King George V) on 21 June 1901. One of the first Wellington buildings reinforced against earthquakes, the style was Classical Baroque and Jacobean; ornamented in white Oamaru stone with carved cornicles and balustrades and roofed with Marsiette tiles. In 1937 it became the Defence Department headquarters but the decorative features, high roof and lighting turrets were removed, and it was demolished in 1982. The new station building was also designed to house the head office of the New Zealand Railways Department. The building now houses the Wellington office of its successor, the New Zealand Railways Corporation in the east wing of the building. The Victoria University of Wellington occupies the west wing. The New World Railway Metro supermarket occupies part of the ground floor. Other occupants include cafes, a bar, a shoe repair shop, and a drycleaners.  Services  \\"Matangi\\" trains at Wellington railway station in 2013 The station copes with large daily passenger numbers with very little alteration having proved necessary. In its first year, 7,600 passengers made 15,200 trips on 140 trains daily. In the 1960s it was estimated that over 42,000 people used the station each day. Today, 29,000 passengers make 44,000 trips on 390 trains, excluding long-distance services. Work from 2019 as part of the Wellington Metro upgrade improved the station approaches, and new foundations were built for 80 masts for the traction overhead as steel masts are to replace wooden masts. = Rail = Two companies operate train services from Wellington. Transdev operates the Wellington suburban rail network on behalf of the Greater Wellington Regional Council. This includes the electrified lines serving the Wellington and Kapiti urban areas, plus the Wairarapa Connection service to Masterton via the Hutt Valley and the Rimutaka Tunnel. At off-peak, 8‚Äì10 trains per hour leave Wellington, broken down they are:- *2 tph Johnsonville Line services to Johnsonville *3 tph Kapiti Line services to Waikanae (2tph on weekends) *3 tph Hutt Valley Line services to Upper Hutt (2tph on weekends) *1 tph Melling Line to Melling (weekdays only) *Five Wairarapa Connection services per day to Masterton (2 per day at weekends) KiwiRail Scenic Journeys operates two-long distance services from Wellington up the North Island Main Trunk. The Capital Connection service operates to Palmerston North once daily on weekdays. The Northern Explorer service operates to Auckland Strand three times per week. = Bus = The following bus services use the roadway beside platform 9; *Interislander shuttles to the ferry terminal *InterCity and Newmans long- distance coaches = Bus Terminal = The bus terminal, formerly Lambton Interchange, is served by most Wellington bus routes and is connected to the station by a subway under Featherston St. The following bus routes serve the bus terminal: 1, 3, 7, 12e, 14, 17e, 19e, 22, 23e, 24, 25, 26, 29e, 30x, 31x, 32x, 36, 52, 56, 57, 58, 60e, 81, 83, 84 and 85x.

The lyrics represent a man or boy who is learning to find his own way in life away from his mother. The song is directly written about Hetfield's difficult relationship with his mother, who died of cancer when he was 16 years old. The song is a departure from Metallica's usual heavy metal sound; its genre-blending style incorporates country, blues, and hard rock. \\"Mama Said\\" begins with acoustic guitar and, during the chorus, becomes flush with a country-flavored vocal harmony and steel guitar. Toward the end, the song features power chords on electric guitar. \\"Mama Said\\" has never been featured as a part of Metallica's live setlist. Hetfield has performed this song live, however, using a single steel- stringed acoustic guitar with no drum or bass accompaniment. He also performed it along with country singer Jessi Colter on CMT's Outlaw Concert, along with Hetfield's cover of Waylon Jennings's \\"Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out of Hand.\\" Demo An early demo version is also entitled \\"Mama Said (The Story So Far)\\" which was recorded in Lars Ulrich's home musical studio \\"Dungeon\\" on April 14, 1995.

December 28, 1929 ‚Äì February 17, 2020) was an American labor union activist. He was president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) from 1983 to 1995. Born in Michigan, Bieber joined the McInerney Spring and Wire Company, an automotive parts supplier in Grand Rapids, after finishing high school. His father was also employed at the company, and had co-founded a UAW local there. Bieber himself became active within the local, rising from shop steward to its president between 1949 and 1956. In 1961 he became a part-time union organizer for the UAW's international union and retired as president of the local a year later, to work full-time for the international UAW. In 1980 he was elected as the head of the UAW's General Motors Department. After a hotly contested election in 1983, he was chosen to head the union in October of that year. His time as president of the union was marked by support of several political causes, including the boycott against South African apartheid and opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. He oversaw the union during the shrinking of the automobile manufacturing industry in the US, and led them through a number of tense negotiations with the Big Three automobile manufacturers that included strikes and other labor action. While he set a goal of adding new union members throughout his presidency, he largely failed as union organizing efforts at Honda and Nissan plants were defeated. His presidency also saw the splintering of his own union, with the Canadian division breaking off to form its own independent organization (the Canadian Auto Workers), amid deep internal divisions which developed throughout his term. He retired from the UAW in 1995. Early life and career Owen F. Bieber was born in December 1929 to Albert F. and Minnie (Schwartz) Bieber in the hamlet of North Dorr, Dorr Township, Allegan County, Michigan.Maynard, \\"Owen Bieber: Rising Above Criticism,\\" United Press International, November 12, 1982.Current Biography Yearbook, 1986, p. 46.Fucini and Fucini, 1992, p. 10. His father was of German descent and an autoworker at McInerney Spring and Wire Company (an automotive parts supplier) who had co-founded UAW Local 687.Lippert, \\"Bieber Held to a Steady Course\\", Detroit Free Press, June 10, 1995. It was the first UAW local organized within the city limits of Grand Rapids, Michigan.Woolley, \\"Bieber Started in Plant Father Helped Organize\\", Associated Press, November 12, 1982. The family were devout Roman Catholics, and Bieber attended Visitation Elementary School (a two-room school)\\"Bieber Rose from Onion Fields to UAW Presidency\\", Associated Press, May 18, 1983. and Catholic Central High School in nearby Grand Rapids.Maynard, \\"New UAW Leader Faces Problems\\", United Press International, November 13, 1982. As a child, he worked pulling weeds in onion and celery fields. He graduated from high school in 1948, and in July of that year took a job at McInerney Spring and Wire as a wire bender, making seats for Cadillac and Hudson cars.Holusha, \\"U.A.W. Caucus Nominating Heir to Fraser Today\\", The New York Times, November 12, 1982. \\"You had to bend 8- and 9-gauge spring wire, sometimes five wires at a time. Those Hudsons, they had a seat four miles long ... It was a hard job. After the first hour in there, I felt like just leaving. If my father hadn't worked there, too, I probably would've\\", he later said. Bieber married his high school sweetheart, the former Shirley M. Van Woerkom, on November 25, 1950, and the couple had three sons (all of them became autoworkers) and two daughters.Current Biography Yearbook, 1986, p. 49. They maintained a home in North Dorr as well as Southfield. Although his wire bending job was supposed to be only summer employment, Bieber stayed and did not go on to college. Bieber was elected a shop steward of Local 687 (which covered Grand Rapids and most of the immediate surrounding area) in 1949, and in 1951 was elected to the local's executive board.Newsmakers, 1988, p. 41.Mundo, 1992, p. 120. He was elected to Local 687's collective bargaining committee in 1955, and became the local's president in 1956. In 1961, he became a part-time union organizer for the international union.Labor Relations Yearbook, 1984, p. 180. Bieber retired as Local 687's president in 1962, and took a full-time position as an international representative and organizer with the UAW. He worked closely with Kenneth W. Robinson, the director of UAW Region 1D (then the largest region in the international union). Robinson promoted Bieber to servicing representative in 1964, and made him his personal aide. On December 18, 1972, Robinson appointed Bieber assistant director of Region 1D after the incumbent, Charles Rogers, was diagnosed with cancer and stepped down.Business People in the News, 1976, p. 22. In 1974, Robinson stepped down as director of Region 1D due to ill health.Current Biography Yearbook, 1986, p. 47. Bieber was elected as his successor, and held the position until 1980.Maynard, \\"Owen Bieber: New UAW President\\", United Press International, May 18, 1983. =GM Department director= In 1980, Bieber won election as vice president of the General Motors Department of the UAW. Irving Bluestone, who had led the GM Department since 1970, had retired.Stuart, \\"Auto Union Gets New Leadership\\", The New York Times, June 7, 1980. The UAW Steering Committee (a body of about 400 local union presidents) unanimously endorsed Bieber for the position.Stanton, \\"The United Auto Workers Union Prepares for Leadership Changes\\", Associated Press, January 12, 1980. Also nominated for vice president slots were Donald Ephlin, Ray Majerus, and Stephen Yokich. Bieber won the election at the UAW's national convention in June 1980, receiving the highest number of votes of any candidate. Bieber was GM Department director for just two and a half years, but negotiated a historic contract with General Motors (GM) in 1982. The early 1980s recession and competition from Japanese automakers had cut very deeply into GM's market share, and the company had laid off more than 140,000 of its 330,000 production workers (roughly half its workforce).Fucini and Fucini, 1992, pp. 11‚Äì12.Holusha, \\"Union's Leaders Foresee Strike or Cuts at G.M.\\", The New York Times, February 17, 1982. UAW membership had fallen to 1.2 million from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979. In March 1981, nine months after Bieber became GM Department head, GM asked the union to reopen its contract and negotiation concessions but the union refused.Holusha, \\"Auto Labor Groups Agree to Consider Reopening Pacts\\", The New York Times, December 22, 1981. In November 1981, however, GM began using its worker participation program to convince its unionized employees to reopen their contract.\\"Union Upset By G.M. Plea\\", The New York Times, November 19, 1981. Bieber strongly criticized the company for generating \\"distrust of the U.A.W. leadership\\", \\"spoonfeed[ing]\\" a \\"captive audience\\", and perverting the worker participation program into a means to \\"propagandize or parrot the current views of the chairman of the board of G.M. as to how to save G.M. through worker sacrifice.\\" But behind the scenes, UAW president Douglas Fraser, Bieber, and others were secretly already talking with GM about reopening the contract.Serrin, \\"Shrinking U.A.W. Tries to Steer a Steady Course Through Troubled Times\\", The New York Times, June 22, 1982. The union agreed to enter into talks in January 1982,Holusha, \\"Layoffs Are Just One U.A.W. Problem\\", The New York Times, January 24, 1982. hoping to win job security commitments for its members in exchange for wage and benefit concessions. The decision was a historic one, as it was only the second time in UAW history that the union had agreed to reopen a contract. It was historic as well as it was the first concessionary contract the union had negotiated. In April 1982, UAW members approved the concessionary contract Bieber negotiated. Initially, GM agreed to link wage concessions to reductions in the price of its vehicles, but this was not part of the eventual agreement.Holusha, \\"Auto Unionists Narrowly Favor New G.M. Pact\\", The New York Times, April 10, 1982. The contract concessions were (at the time) the largest ever made to GM. The workers agreed to forgo an annual 3 percent wage increase, eliminated nine paid holidays over the next two years, deferred cost of living adjustments in the first three months of the contract to the final three quarters of the contract, established a wage tier that paid new employees 20 percent less, and implemented fines for chronic absenteeism. The union also agreed to negotiate over work rules at the local level. In return, GM agreed to keep four plants open which it had planned to close, agreed to a two-year moratorium on plant closings, established profit sharing, established a prepaid legal service program for its employees, and promised that if it laid off workers with 15 years or more of job experience it would pay them 50 percent of their annual salary. The pact was only narrowly approved, however (114,468 for and 105,090 against), even though UAW members at Ford Motor Company had approved a similar pact by a 3-to-1 margin. Implementing the contract proved troublesome, however. Just days after the pact was approved by UAW members, GM attempted to give its executives large pay bonuses.\\"U.A.W. to Oppose Bonuses at G.M.\\", The New York Times, April 21, 1982; \\"UAW Criticizes New Bonus Plan for GM Executives\\", Associated Press, April 21, 1982. Bieber angrily denounced the pay plan and GM backed off the proposal just two days later;Holusha, \\"G.M. Backs Down on Executive Bonus\\", The New York Times, April 23, 1982. however, the damage was done. Bieber began local bargaining over the work rules, but angry workers refused to negotiate any changes and bargaining ended in July 1982 with no changes.Maynard, \\"Anger at GM Hurting Local Talks: Bieber\\", United Press International, June 28, 1982; Maynard, \\"GM Workers Reject Additional Concessions\\", United Press International, July 22, 1982. In his last year as GM Department director, Bieber discussed with GM the impact outsourcing was having on UAW members.\\"Union, GM to Discuss Outsourcing,\\" Associated Press, October 14, 1982. When GM signed a compact with Toyota to co-own and co-manufacture automobiles in California, Bieber worked to prevent UAW members in affected GM plants from engaging in a wildcat strike.\\"UAW Workers to Vote on GM Strike\\", United Press International, April 15, 1983; \\"Union Denies Report of Strike Over General Motors-Toyota Pact\\", Associated Press, April 15, 1983. =UAW presidential race= The UAW constitution barred anyone over the age of 65 from running for president of the union.Woolley, \\"UAW Choice Could Be Made Before Thanksgiving\\", Associated Press, August 30, 1982. 64-year-old Douglas Fraser won re-election as UAW president in July 1981, but was barred from seeking a third term.\\"Fraser Will Not Run for Third Term\\", United Press International, July 13, 1981. In January 1982, Owen Bieber, Donald Ephlin (director of the Ford Department), Raymond Majerus (secretary-treasurer and director of the Aerospace Department and American Motors Department), and Stephen Yokich (director of the Agricultural Implement and Skilled Trades Department) were considered his most likely successors.\\"Working on Picking Leader to Follow UAW Chief\\", Associated Press, August 11, 1982. At that time, Bieber and Majerus seemed to have the most support from the union's executive board.Holusha, \\"4 Seek Presidency of Auto Workers\\", The New York Times, September 21, 1982. It is a tradition in the UAW for the union's executive board to bar candidates from campaigning while contract negotiations are going on, to prevent any campaign from distracting union members or inflaming member opinions. Since the election of Walter Reuther as UAW president in 1947, the union had been dominated by the \\"Administrative Caucus,\\" a pro-incumbent political party within the UAW which controlled every seat on the UAW executive board and the vast majority of leadership positions at the local level.Moody, 1988, pp. 45‚Äì47. Traditionally, the 26 Administrative Caucus members sitting on the UAW's executive board met first to select the caucus' official nominees for national office, then referred these nominees to the union's Administrative Caucus-dominated Steering Committee, which then ratified the board's choice.Serrin, \\"Disputed Union Election is Embarrassing U.A.W.\\", The New York Times, August 25, 1986. Delegates to the union's annual convention voted on these nominees (with no direct election by the membership). Although these procedures did not preclude the Steering Committee from rejecting the \\"official\\" slate or challengers from running for office, they made it highly unlikely that challengers would emerge or that the members would elect them if they did. (Additionally, union rules required that any challenger announce his or her candidacy at least 90 days before the election, and take a leave of absence from his or her job in order to run for office.) Although the executive board had not anticipated meeting until December 1982 to select its official candidate for president, the lack of a clear front-runner and the economic and collective bargaining challenges facing the union put pressure on the executive board to make its choice months earlier. By late August, Majerus seemed to have a slim lead among executive board members over Ephlin, while the other candidates (including Bieber) did not have much support. At its meeting on September 20, the UAW executive board agreed to lift the campaigning moratorium, and set November 12 as the date for choosing its official slate.Barnes, \\"Fraser Lifts Moratorium on Campaigning for UAW President\\", Associated Press, September 21, 1982. Support for the four candidates had not changed by this time. The relatively youthful Yokich was considered a dark horse candidate, and he was under pressure to withdraw and support one of the others. Ephlin, however, appeared to be gaining support due to his successful contract negotiations with Ford and his increasingly polished public speaking skills. Bieber hesitated to enter the race for president. He announced his candidacy only in mid-October, long after Majerus and Ephlin. He later said he \\"agonized\\" about entering the race for the presidency after realizing what a heavy burden it might become. On October 31, Yokich withdrew from the race and threw his support behind Bieber.\\"Yokich Says He Supports Bieber\\", Associated Press, November 1, 1982.Sawyer, \\"UAW Leaders Pick New Chief Amid Troubled Times for Union\\", The Washington Post, November 13, 1982. Days later, a survey of 130 UAW local leaders in Michigan showed that Ephlin and Bieber had the most grassroots support, with Majerus a distant fourth behind Yokich.\\"Survey Shows Bieber, Ephlin Favored\\", Associated Press, November 3, 1982. But Majerus appeared to have far more support on the UAW executive board, where African American vice president Marc Stepp was vocal in his support of the Majerus campaign.Maynard, \\"UAW Race Between Bieber and Majerus\\", United Press International, November 7, 1982. One media report estimated that Majerus had the support of as many as 10 of the 26 board members, while Bieber (whose campaign had been targeting regional directors and workers) may have had as many as 12 votes. Nonetheless, others considered Bieber a dark horse candidate because of the significant dissatisfaction the GM concessionary contract had generated.Townsend, \\"Candidates Vie for Chance to Head UAW\\", The Christian Science Monitor, November 9, 1982. As the UAW executive board gathered to make its decision, the race had shifted and Bieber appeared to have majority support on the board. Bieber appeared to have gained ground because he was a compromise candidate acceptable to both the Ephlin and Majerus camps. Some board members appear to have preferred Bieber because he came from the GM Department, the union's largest. Majerus, however, had nearly as much support.Maynard, \\"UAW Leaders Vote on President\\", United Press International, November 12, 1982. Press reports indicated that Ephlin had a chance, if the board deadlocked over Bieber and Majerus. The board voted for Bieber as its preferred nominee. Union insiders later described the executive board's choice as a surprise. None of the three candidates received a majority on the first ballot.Holusha, \\"Auto Union's Leaders Back Chief at G.M. For Top Post\\", The New York Times, November 13, 1982. Ephlin, who had the fewest votes, withdrew from the race, and the board voted 15 to 11 to support Bieber. (Press reports later described this as \\"unusually close\\".)Douglas, Herron, and Wright, \\"A Tough Choice For U.A.W. Post\\", The New York Times, November 14, 1982. Majerus withdrew, and the board took a third ballot to make its decision unanimous (a tradition within the union). The Steering Committee ratified the executive board's decision shortly thereafter. Bieber's campaigning among the regional directors, who formed a majority on the executive board, swung the election in his favor. Bieber's election was not a foregone conclusion, however. The UAW leadership was by now facing \\"the first widespread opposition since the bitter factional days of the 1940s.\\" The unions secret talks with GM in the fall of 1981 had become known, and many union members were very angry about them. It was no longer clear that members would do as their leaders wished. A group of workers based in Wisconsin submitted a constitutional amendment eliminating the executive board's and Steering Committee's roles in the nomination process, and won enough support from the membership to force a roll call vote on the amendment on the convention floor.Maynard, \\"Grass Roots Referendum Effort at UAW Meeting\\", United Press International, May 16, 1983. But the convention delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal by a 3-to-1 margin.Woolley, \\"Direct Elections Opposed By Convention Delegates\\", Associated Press, May 17, 1983. No opposition candidate emerged, and Bieber was elected President of the UAW on May 18, 1983.Holusha, \\"Auto Union Convention Chooses Bieber as Chief\\", The New York Times, May 19, 1983.Woolley, \\"Bieber Elected UAW President\\", Associated Press, May 18, 1983. His election marked the end of an era in the UAW. He was the first UAW president who did not work directly with the founders of the union and who did not work directly and closely with Walter Reuther. UAW presidency Bieber was not considered as charismatic as his predecessors. He was often reticent to the point of shyness with the press, and took lessons from broadcasters to improve his speaking. His leadership style was considered over-cautious, as he feared to make mistakes, and he was emotionally stoic. Initially, Bieber was denied a seat on the board of directors of Chrysler. Chrysler had put UAW president Douglas Fraser on its board in 1979 after Fraser helped win $1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the federal government that kept Chrysler out of bankruptcy.Flink, 1988, p. 394. Worried that Fraser's seat would become the \\"UAW seat\\", Chrysler chief executive officer Lee Iacocca threatened not to appoint Fraser's successor to the board of directors.Budd, 2005, p. 270.\\"Seat for Union Now in Doubt\\", The New York Times, April 5, 1984; \\"Chrysler and Bieber to Discuss Seat\\", Associated Press, April 6, 1984. Fraser persuaded Iacocca that appearances would be served if Fraser stayed on a board for one more year, and then the new UAW president could be elected. Iacocca agreed to the plan. Fraser was elected in 1983 to a one-year term on Chrysler's board.Holusha, \\"U.A.W.'s Departing Chief to Stay on Chrysler Board\\", The New York Times, March 6, 1983; \\"Fraser to Remain on Chrysler Board\\", The Washington Post, March 7, 1983; \\"Fraser Expects Bieber to Follow Him on Chrysler Board\\", Associated Press, May 2, 1983. Bieber joined the Chrysler board in October 1984,Gilpin, \\"U.A.W. President On Chrysler Board\\", The New York Times, October 5, 1984. and remained on it until 1991.Levin, \\"Chrysler to Cut Board; U.A.W. Chief Is Out,\\" New York Times, March 14, 1991. The UAW went without representation on Chrysler's board for the next seven years, until Stephen Yokich joined the board of the now-German owned company in 1998. Walter Reuther and other presidents of the UAW had been active in a number of social issues, and Bieber continued that tradition. In 1983, he was a member of a controversial effort to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.Rule, \\"Plan to Commemorate Dr. King's 1963 March Meets Resistance,\\" New York Times, August 10, 1983. Bieber joined the National Labor Committee, a group which opposed U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua.Serrin, \\"Labor Resolution Criticizes U.S. Role in Central America,\\" New York Times, October 30, 1985. The group successfully overcame vocal opposition from staunch anti- communists on the AFL-CIO executive council to win approval of a resolution that put the labor federation in favor of a negotiated settlement and criticized the Reagan administration of seeking only a military solution. In January 1986, he won AFL-CIO approval of a boycott of U.S. companies doing business in South Africa under apartheid.Toner, \\"Bishop Tutu Hails Demonstrators Near South African Embassy,\\" New York Times, January 9, 1986; Toner, \\"Shell Boycott Urged,\\" New York Times, January 10, 1986. Later that year, he traveled to South Africa, where he met with several cabinet ministers and angrily demanded that the government release anti-apartheid labor leaders who had been jailed but never charged with any crimes. He also successfully put pressure on GM to pay these workers until they had been convicted. In 1990, shortly after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela traveled to the United States and thanked Bieber for his support; Bieber gave him a guided tour of the Ford River Rouge Complex. Bieber also pressed for adoption of a national industrial policy. He began pressing for a national industrial policy in June 1983, shortly after his election as UAW president.Arenson, \\"Debate Grows Over Adoption of National Industrial Policy,\\" New York Times, June 19, 1983. His efforts reached a high point in 1993, when Bieber the chief executive officers of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors met with President- elect Bill Clinton‚Äîwinning Clinton's support for the domestic auto industry.\\"Clinton to Meet Auto Chiefs,\\" New York Times, January 5, 1993;Friedman, \\"Auto Makers Ask Clinton to Limit Imports of Mini-Vans From Japan,\\" January 7, 1993. But less than a year later, Clinton won passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement over Bieber's strenuous objections. =Collective bargaining= Bieber oversaw the negotiation of a number of contracts with the Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors during his 12 years in office. The first contract negotiation he oversaw were with Chrysler just two months after his election. The negotiations (which began earlier than usual, long before the contract expired) broke down over wages in July 1983. Although a strike seemed likely,Holusha, \\"Union Talks With Chrysler Break Down on Wage Issue,\\" New York Times, July 28, 1983. the union negotiated a minor contract extension on September 5,Holusha, \\"Chrysler and Auto Workers Agree on Contract Extension,\\" New York Times, September 6, 1983. and a day later had a new agreement. The contract provided an average wage increase of $2.42 an hour over two years and restored an annual 3 percent wage and quarterly cost of living increases (both of which the company had rejected in July).Holusha, \\"U.A.W. Panel Approves $2.42 Chrysler Pay Raise,\\" New York Times, September 7, 1983. During the press conference in which he discussed the contract's successful ratification, Bieber fell from the dais and suffered a slight concussion (for which he was briefly hospitalized).\\"Union Chief Leaves Hospital,\\" United Press International, September 11, 1983. The second round of talks (which occurred about 15 months later) involved GM. Traditionally, the UAW chose one of the \\"Big Three\\" (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) automakers as a strike target, and negotiate a contract with that company. This contract usually set a standard which the other companies adhered to. Ford or GM was the more common target, as they were much larger than Chrysler.It was easier to get Chrysler to fall in line with Ford or GM than it was for the much larger companies to follow small Chrysler. Negotiations with GM began first, with the company asking for a profit-sharing plan rather than wage increases, layoffs of about 19 percent of its 370,000 workers, and a lower wage tier for new workers.Holusha, \\"Document by G.M. Shows Labor Plan,\\" New York Times, February 19, 1984. Bieber kept Ford and GM guessing as to which company would be the strike target, but finally chose GM on September 6.Holusha, \\"Union Picks Two Auto Makers as Strike Targets,\\" New York Times, August 30, 1984; Holusha, \\"Auto Workers' Union Picks G.M. As Strike target in Talks on Pact,\\" New York Times, September 7, 1984. The talks broke down shortly thereafter, and Bieber called a nationwide strike against General Motors on September 14 as the economy continued to perform only weakly.Holusha, \\"Auto Talks to Resume as Strikes Are Called at Some G.M. Plants,\\" New York Times, September 15, 1984. Over the next six days, more than 91,000 GM workers walked picket lines at 33 plants in 12 states.Holusha, \\"13 G.M. Factories Struck by Locals, Talks in Recess,\\" New York Times, September 16, 1984; Holusha, \\"20-Hour Bargaining Session Stalls in G.M.

A contract was agreed to (and successfully ratified) on September 20 which not only gave workers annual pay increases of 2.5 percent and established a $1 billion fund that paid laid off workers a portion of their salary until they were retrained or rehired.\\"G.M. and the Auto Workers Agree on a Tentative National Contract,\\" Associated Press, September 21, 1984; Holusha, \\"Leaders of Auto Union Locals Endorse General Motors Pact,\\" New York Times, September 27, 1984.Wright and Herron, \\"'Historic' Deal Ends Walkouts at General Motors,\\" New York Times, September 23, 1984. The contract, which the union and company called \\"historic,\\" Twenty-five days later, Ford agreed to a very similar contract. The Ford agreement established a $300 million lay-off fund (Ford's workforce being only a third the size of GM's), and placed a four-year moratorium on plant closings.Holusha, \\"Auto Union Gains a Pact With Ford,\\" New York Times, October 15, 1984. Another strike followed at Chrysler the next year. The Ford and GM contracts reopened a pay gap between those companies and Chrysler which the UAW sought to close in late 1984 by asking Chrysler if it would reopen its contract. Chrysler refused, pointing to a no-strike clause in the contract.Holusha, \\"Chrysler Rebuffs Union's Plea to Cancel Contract,\\" New York Times, December 14, 1984. UAW workers had rejected a 1982 contract which contained profit-sharing, and their 1983 agreement did not have any income security provisions like Ford's and GM's. When the Chrysler contract expired in October 1985, Bieber ordered a strike against the company. More than 70,000 workers in the U.S. and another 10,000 in Canada walked off the job for 12 days in what was the first strike against Chrysler since 1973.Holusha, \\"Auto Unions Call Strike As Chrysler Contract Ends,\\" New York Times, October 16, 1985; Holusha, \\"Chrysler Struck By Auto Workers,\\" New York Times, October 17, 1985; Holusha, \\"Chrysler and Union Break Off Talks for Weekend,\\" New York Times, October 19, 1985; Holusha, \\"U.A.W. Raises Money Goals in Strike at Chrysler,\\" New York Times, October 20, 1985. The two sides reached an agreement (which was successfully ratified) on October 23 that gave autoworkers a $2,120 non-wage bonus, pay increases and wage parity with the GM and Ford, profit sharing, and payments to workers displaced by new technology.Holusha, \\"Union at Chrysler in Tentative Pact,\\" New York Times, October 24, 1985; Holusha, \\"U.A.W. Ends Strike As Members Back Pact for Chrysler,\\" New York Times, October 28, 1985. Bieber announced in December 1985 that he would again seek election as UAW president.\\"U.A.W. Chief Chosen to Run for Re-election,\\" Reuters, December 11, 1985. He won reelection with no opposition in June 1986.Holusha, \\"U.A.W. Pledges to Organize Employees at Japanese Plants in U.S.,\\" New York Times, June 8, 1986. Bieber oversaw a fourth round of collective bargaining talks in 1987. Ford was chosen as the strike target this time, and after a slight contract extension the union reached a tentative contract with the company on September 17.Holusha, \\"Ford, Not G.M., Chosen as U.A.W. Strike Target,\\" New York Times, September 1, 1987; Holusha, \\"Ford and Union Extend Contract Talks,\\" New York Times, September 15, 1987; Holusha, \\"Ford and U.A.W. Agree on New Pact,\\" New York Times, September 18, 1987. Bieber agreed to establish joint committees at the national and local levels to explore the use of work teams, changing inefficient work rules, and reducing the number of job classifications.Holusha, \\"Union Leaders Approve New Ford Pact,\\" New York Times, September 19, 1987. In exchange, the company agreed to a 3 percent annual wage increase in the first year with lump-sum payments equal to 3 percent of wages in the second and third years, no layoffs (except through attrition), an increase in the layoff income security fund to $500 (although it was capped at that amount), pension contribution increases, improvements in health benefits, and increased profit sharing.Holusha, \\"Pact With G.M. Backed By Auto Union Council,\\" New York Times, October 13, 1987. Twenty-one days later, GM agreed to a very similar contract.Holusha, \\"G.M. and U.A.W. Reach Tentative Pact,\\" New York Times, October 9, 1987. GM agreed to close no more plants, institute no more layoffs (so long as sales volumes did not decrease), the same wage and lump-sum package, the same profit sharing arrangement, similar work team and job classification study committees, and establish quality improvement committees in all plants. Both contracts were easily approved by the membership.\\"General Motors Pact Accepted,\\" Associated Press, October 26, 1987. The success of the GM and Ford pacts led Chrysler to enter into early talks once more with the union.\\"U.A.W. and Chrysler Agree to Early Talks,\\" Associated Press, March 12, 1988. After just seven weeks of bargaining, Bieber announced a contract which gave company workers a 3 percent annual pay increase over two years and a $1,000 bonus.Holusha, \\"Chrysler Reaches Pact With Union,\\" New York Times, May 5, 1988.Holusha, \\"Chrysler and the U.A.W.: A Union Pact to Restrict Executive Privilege,\\" New York Times, May 15, 1988. However, the Chrysler contract did contain a historic clause which prohibited the company from issuing cash or stock bonuses to its executives if its employees did not receive payments under the profit sharing agreement. Bieber ran for reelection again in 1988 and won against no opposition.Levin, \\"A Vote for Auto Plant Cooperation,\\" New York Times, June 24, 1989. His election was by acclamation.Risen, \\"Bieber Wins, Dissenters Lose in UAW Voting,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 22, 1989. By 1990, Bieber was once more negotiating a contract with GM. However, his control of the collective bargaining process was not as strong as in the past. A local struck the GM plant in Flint, Michigan, on August 8, 1990, about a month before the national contract with the company ended.Levin, \\"G.M. Strike in Michigan Imperils Industry Talks With Union,\\" New York Times, August 13, 1990. Bieber had little to do with the strike, which was approved by GM Department Director Stephen Yokich (by now considered Bieber's most likely successor). The Flint strike complicated Bieber's attempts to negotiate a new national contract, and Yokich's approval of the local strike indicated Bieber's weakening control over the union. The Flint strike ended on August 15. Nonetheless, it had generated UAW member unrest with Bieber's leadership of the union.Levin, \\"The G.M. Strike, While Resolved, Reflects Many Workers' Unrest,\\" New York Times, August 16, 1990. Bieber did not need a contract extension this time, and negotiated a contract identical in wage structure to the 1987 agreement.Levin, \\"Union and G.M. Reach Accord On Pact Enhancing Job Security,\\" New York Times, September 18, 1990; \\"Auto Workers Union Approves G.M. Accord,\\" Associated Press, October 2, 1990. A Ford contract followed in early October 1990, and a Chrysler contract 20 days later, both of which were very similar to the GM agreement.Levin, \\"Ford and Auto Union Reach Contract Agreement,\\" New York Times, October 8, 1990; Levin, \\"Strike Is Averted at Chrysler With Accord on a New Pact,\\" New York Times, October 31, 1990. Bieber suffered a serious loss at industrial equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc., however. The UAW struck Caterpillar in 1982, a strike that (by 1993) was the longest in UAW history and which had severely drained the union's strike fund.Workers League, 1993, p. 40.Franklin, 2002, p. 91. By 1989, the UAW was praising the Caterpillar contract.Brecher, 1997, p. 349. Notwithstanding, Caterpillar began a restructuring program that reduced its workforce by 30 percent while building new plants in the non-union Deep South.Franklin, 2002, p. 91-92. By 1991, only 25 percent of its workforce belonged to the UAW. The UAW had negotiated a new contract with John Deere, the giant agricultural machinery manufacturer, and it asked Caterpillar for the same terms.Ashby and Hawking, 2009, p. 32.Franklin, 2002, p. 92. Caterpillar refused, instead demanding major concessions such as a two-tier wage system, the right to subcontract work out to non-union companies, the imposition of 12-hour work shifts, weaker safety rules, a weaker grievance system, greatly scaled back health benefits, and the right to impose flexible work schedules on workers. About 1,870 workers in Decatur, Illinois, struck on November 3, and Caterpillar instituted a nationwide lockout (even in those plants not on strike).Haycraft, 2000, p. 413.Franklin, 2002, p. 93. Soon more than 13,400 Caterpillar workers were walking the picket line. Caterpillar ended the lockout on March 16, 1992, but few employees went back to work. Caterpillar tendered what it called its last, best offer to Bieber three days later. Bieber rejected the proposal.Haycraft, 2000, p. 413-414. Caterpillar announced an impasse on March 5, and on April 1 sent all workers a letter demanding that they return to work by April 6 or the company would permanently replace them.Haycraft, 2000, p. 414.Franklin, 2002, p. 102. Between 400 and 1,200 workers crossed the picket line to return to work (estimates very widely).Brecher, 1997, p. 349-350; Franklin, 2002, p. 103. At the urging of federal mediators, Bieber met one-on-one with Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Donald V. Fites.Franklin, 2002, p. 104.Hicks, \\"Caterpillar and Union Agree to Meeting,\\" New York Times, April 11, 1992. Bieber left the meeting convinced that the UAW was left with no alternative but to accept Caterpillar's offer. UAW members went back to work on the company's terms.Haycraft, 2000, p. 414-415.Kilborn, \\"Caterpillar's Trump Card: Threat of Permanently Replacing Strikers Gave Company Advantage Against Union,\\" New York Times, April 16, 1992. Bieber announced he would run for reelection as UAW president in 1992. In January 1992, shortly after Bieber's candidacy was approved by the Administrative Caucus and Steering Committee, he was challenged for the presidency by Jerry Tucker, a former executive board member and leader of the reformist \\"New Directions\\" caucus. Tucker, a long-time opponent of joint labor-management committees and work teams, also intended to challenge Bieber's support for these new collective bargaining outcomes at the UAW convention in June.Levin, \\"For Auto Workers, Meeting Comes at a Crucial Juncture,\\" New York Times, June 14, 1992. During the convention, it was apparent that Stephen Yokich was now Bieber's \\"heir apparent.\\" Bieber was easily reelected president of the UAW.Levin, \\"'Transplant' Car Makers Redefine the Industry,\\" New York Times, June 23, 1992. Bieber's final round of collective bargaining talks came in 1993, but once more his control of the union's bargaining apparatus was apparent. In August and September 1992, GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, struck a critical GM parts plant with Yokich's permission, idling many other GM plants and throwing 40,000 other GM employees out of work.Levin, \\"Auto Workers End Walkout Against G.M.,\\" New York Times, September 6, 1992. The Detroit Free Press later said that Bieber formally approved the strike, but Yokich was the \\"quarterback\\" who actually led the union through it. Despite the problems the Lordstown strike created, Bieber entered contract negotiations with the Big Three automakers seeking pledges against new layoffs.Uchitelle, \\"Auto Union Seeks to Deter Detroit From New Layoffs,\\" New York Times, May 2, 1993. Bieber chose Ford as the strike target, and the company focused on reining in health care costs as its major goal.Bennet, \\"Auto Union Set to Aim at One of Big Three,\\" New York Times, August 30, 1993; Bennet, \\"Union Settles on Ford as Target in Contract Talks,\\" New York Times, August 31, 1993; Bennet, \\"Auto Talks Hang on Health Costs But Workers Are Loath to Chip In,\\" New York Times, September 6, 1993. A new contract was reached on September 15, 1993, but the deal was considered a failure since Bieber was unable to win any major changes to the old agreement.Bennet, \\"U.A.W and Ford Agree on New Contract,\\" New York Times, September 16, 1993.Bennet, \\"For Ford, a New Contract but Little New Ground,\\" New York Times, September 17, 1993. Ford asked for a six-year rather than a three-year agreement, and thereafter gave this goal up and promised instead to increase pension payouts by 17 percent for certain veteran workers. The union agreed to a lower wage for new workers, and extend the time it took for new workers to reach the full wage. No changes were made to the wage or layoff income security provisions. However, Ford did agree to fully pay for health care costs for all workers, but the workers gave up a part of their pay raises to do so.Bennet, \\"Health Cost Payment in Ford Pact,\\" New York Times, September 18, 1993. A contract with GM followed the next month. GM sought to reduce its pension costs, but failed.Bennet, \\"Auto Workers Gain Contract With G.M. Increasing Pensions,\\" New York Times, October 25, 1993. GM, however, forced workers to agree to use vacation time rather than use layoff pay during the summer production shutdown, and gained the right to stop paying layoff pay to workers who refuse jobs at nearby plants. The wage payment scheme was the same as the previous contract. =Organizing failures= Bieber pledged at the start of his presidency to organize new workers but largely failed. He made a number of efforts to organize new workers early in his presidency but in his last years in office budgeted little money and staff resources to the effort. He also did not invest staff or money into mobilizing UAW members to assist in organizing campaigns. Instead, in his last years in office Bieber spent significant amounts of his own time lobbying for labor law reform (most importantly, a ban on the permanent replacement of striking workers). Organizing failures were more important than the union's rare successes during Bieber's administration. In September 1983, Bieber negotiated an agreement in which the union was able to extend its collective bargaining contract over the joint GM-Toyota New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California.Holusha, \\"U.A.W. Wins Recognition at Coast G.M.-Toyota Plant,\\" New York Times, September 23, 1983. The union also won GM's consent to extend its existing collective bargaining relationship over the new GM-owned Saturn Corporation plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation challenged the right of GM to recognize the UAW at the Saturn plant and the right of UAW members to bid first on jobs at the new plant.\\"Labor Board Rebuffs A Challenge to U.A.W. Accord at G.M. Plant,\\" Associated Press, June 4, 1986. But the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board ruled in June 1986 that the bidding rights were properly part of bargaining between GM and the UAW over plant closures that led to the creation of Saturn, and that early extension of the contract was permissible given the number of bidding, existing UAW members. But these victories were uncommon for the UAW under Bieber. When the union began an organizing drive at a Honda-owned manufacturing plant in Ohio in late 1985, most workers wore anti-UAW buttons and it dropped the organizing campaign before the end of the year.Noble, \\"Auto Union Battles Uphill in Japanese Plant in Ohio,\\" New York Times, December 10, 1985. In a speech after winning reelection in 1986, Bieber pledged to organize many Japanese-owned plants in the U.S. In 1988, the UAW targeted a Nissan Motors plant in Tennessee, but the organizing drive sputtered and workers voted not to organize with the union in July 1989.\\"Nissan Plant in Tennessee Is U.A.W. Target,\\" New York Times, January 26, 1988; Levin, \\"Nissan Workers in Tennessee Spurn Union's Bid,\\" New York Times, July 28, 1989. Bieber later called these his \\"most painful\\" experiences as UAW president. By the time Bieber left office, UAW membership had fallen to just 800,000. =Loss of the Canadian Autoworkers Union= During Bieber's tenure in office, the Canadian branch of the UAW broke off and formed an independent union, the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW). Economic dislocations in the United States and Canada enhanced militancy in the Canadian branch of the UAW. Many Canadian labor unions had long advocated syndicalism, in which democratic labor unions and federations of labor unions control corporations in favor of community needs.Adkin, 1998, p. 227. Left-wing labor leaders grew in power within the Canadian UAW throughout the 1970s, and many Canadian union members increasingly perceived their unions as vehicles for political power and control. Throughout the 1970s, Canadian unions engaged in a series of lengthy, often bitter strikes (including a general strike in 1976) in which union members confronted large numbers of police defending corporate interests. In 1978, Bob White, a militant syndicalist, was elected Director of the Canadian UAW. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Canadian autoworkers had struggled to achieve pay parity with their American colleagues (although, with the Canadian dollar at the time worth markedly less than the United States dollar, parity essentially gave Canadian workers a wage advantage). With the onset of the early 1980s recession, the UAW in the United States began granting concessionary contracts to the Big Three automakers. But White refused to engage in concessionary bargaining or to open the Canadian contracts early. The American UAW refused to act when the Big Three began moving plants to non-unionized areas, and soon the American UAW was riven by internal factions which resented the concessions while gaining little job security.Molot, 1993, p. 220-221. The American UAW became further paralyzed because it could not act against non-union plants without angering those workers‚Äîworkers essential (the UAW leadership felt) to the future growth of the union.Molot, 1993, p. 221. Moreover, the Canadian leadership felt that giving in to employer demands for \\"jointedness\\" (the term of joint quality committees, work teams, profit sharing, and similar initiatives) encouraged the union to collude with management against workers.Capelli, 1999, p. 97. The break began in 1984. That year, the Canadian UAW leadership learned that Bieber had actively resisted and counteracted their attempts to avoid a concessionary contract.Caulfield, 2010, p. 147. The Canadian UAW locals at General Motors rejected the contract negotiated by Bieber and his team, and 36,000 union members went out on strike in October. After two weeks, GM agreed to the Canadian union's demands, which included higher annual wage increases and no work teams, no profit sharing, and no joint labor-management committees. The Canadian locals learned that Bieber had threatened to withdraw authorization for their strike, which would have left them without strike pay. The Canadian strike against GM not only strained relationships between the American and Canadian wings of the UAW, but also put a heavy strain on the union's strike fund.Holusha, \\"Auto Union Is Strained By Impact of Canadian Strike,\\" New York Times, October 22, 1984. Angry at Bieber's interference, White and the Canadian leadership offered a resolution before the UAW executive board which would have limited American interference in Canadian UAW affairs.Holusha, \\"Canadian Auto Workers Threaten to Split Unions,\\" New York Times, December 2, 1984; Holusha, \\"U.A.W. to Consider Canada Autonomy,\\" New York Times, December 9, 1984. White's proposal gave the Canadian leadership exclusive control over collective bargaining and strike authorizations, removed international UAW authority over Canadian staff, and granted the Canadians unrestricted access to the UAW strike fund.Holusha, \\"For Disunited Auto Workers, Solidarity Stops at the Border,\\" New York Times, December 16, 1984. Bieber strongly opposed the plan, and the UAW executive board rejected it by a vote of 24-to-1. On December 10, the Canadian UAW announced it was disaffiliating from the UAW and forming its own union.\\"Canadians Break From Auto Union,\\" New York Times, December 11, 1984. The international UAW executive board agreed not to interfere with that process. The two unions negotiated an agreement in March 1985 which formally separated the two unions and provided for a division of assets.\\"Auto Union Nearing Accord,\\" United Press International, March 30, 1985; \\"U.A.W. Accord Is Reached on Canadian Independence,\\" Associated Press, April 1, 1985. =Internal dissent= Bieber's 1985 reelection was not without controversy, and the UAW saw its first substantial internal leadership challenges since the 1940s during his presidency. In 1985, the \\"New Directions\\" caucus was formed by UAW local presidents unhappy with the job loss, concessionary bargaining, and \\"jointedness\\" being promoted by Bieber and the UAW executive board.Perusek, 2006, p. 141.Rubenstein, 2001, p. 155.Caulfield, 2010, p. 152.Tillman, 1999, p. 153. It was one of the two most important union reform movements in the American labor movement in the last two decades of the 20th century (the other being Teamsters for a Democratic Union). New Directions leader Jerry Tucker, then Assistant Director of UAW Region 5, ran for office against Region 5 Director Ken Worley in 1986 and lost by two-tenths of a vote in the closest election in union history.Weinstein, \\"A Less Perfect Union,\\" Mother Jones, April 1988, p. 12.Fucini and Fucini, 1992, p. 201. Five days into his candidacy, Tucker was fired for disobeying a UAW rule which required staff to take a leave of absence at least 90 days before an election date. Bieber openly supported Worley, and Tucker's supporters alleged that the UAW hierarchy had illegally expended union funds in support of Worley's reelection effort. When Tucker attacked the caucus system of running the union as undemocratic, Bieber angry denounced him and said that Tucker had not only participated in the Administrative Caucus meetings in which Worley was renominated but also knew about the 90-day leave of absence rule and chose to ignore it. Tucker sued to have the rule declared illegal.His attorney was Joseph \\"Chip\\" Yablonski and his advisor Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.. Yablonski's father had challenged the president of the United Mine Workers, W. A. Boyle, for office in 1969. Boyle subsequently had him murdered. Rauh had helped clean up the Mine Workers after the murder plot and Boyle's involvement was uncovered. See: Weinstein, \\"A Less Perfect Union,\\" Mother Jones, April 1988, p. 14. The election controversy deeply embarrassed Bieber and the UAW (which had long prided itself on its internally democratic procedures).Weinstein, \\"Union Dissident Elected to UAW's Executive Board,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 3, 1988. Although Tucker lost his challenge to the 90-day rule, a court held that the UAW had improperly expended union funds to support Worley and had intimidated Tucker's supporters.Gottschalk, 2000, p. 212. In a special election held in 1988, Tucker defeated Worley for the Region 5 directorship and joined the UAW executive board. The dispute over jointedness intensified in the summer of 1985. Bieber negotiated a first contract with Saturn Corp. with extensive consensus decision-making and joint management procedures, one that included union members at the highest levels of management‚Äîbut a contract which also set wages at only 80 percent of the national auto industry average and which reduced the number of job classifications to just five (enabling the company to move workers around inside the plant much more easily).Holusha, \\"Innovative Pact Wins Approval of Auto Union,\\" New York Times, July 27, 1985. The Saturn contract upset many New Directions caucus members, who saw Bieber's advocacy of the contract as another sign of the union's refusal to fight concessions.Asher, 1995, p. 249. New Directions members pledged to challenge Bieber's support for \\"jointedness\\" at the UAW convention in June 1989.Levin, \\"U.A.W.'s Challenge From Within,\\" New York Times, June 18, 1989. Tucker ran for reelection as Director of Region 5, and ran a candidate for the director of Region 1. Donald Ephlin, Director of the GM Department, retired, claiming exhaustion from the constant battles with the New Directions leadership. Stephen Yokich was named his replacement, which was something of a victory for the New Directions caucus. Bieber mobilized the UAW leadership to defeat Tucker. In an election marred by charges and counter-charges of election fraud, Tucker and the Region 1 candidate both lost by 2-to-1 margins. Bieber strongly criticized the New Directions leadership for not offering concrete alternatives to jointedness, and delivered a strong speech in favor of labor- management cooperation.Levin, \\"Union Leader Backs Cooperation With Industry,\\" New York Times, June 19, 1989. Bieber's speech had a strong effect on the convention delegates. The delegates easily defeated several procedural votes which would have placed New Directions resolutions on the agenda, and the weakness of the dissidents surprised many observers. In 1992, Tucker declared the UAW a \\"bureaucratic one-party state\\" and announced he would challenge Bieber for the presidency of the UAW.\\"A Challenge to U.A.W. Leader,\\" New York Times, January 31, 1992. His was the first serious leadership challenge in 40 years. Tucker received only 5 percent of the convention votes, an indication his support may have slipped during the previous three years.Dandaneau, 1996, p. 15. The vote was the first roll call vote for president in the union since 1974.\\"UAW President Bieber Headed for Fourth Term,\\" Daily Labor Report, June 18, 1992, p. 49. That a quarter of the delegates supported New Directions' direct election of the UAW president indicated, however, that the movement still had significant support among a minority of UAW members. New Directions, however, was not able to bring many of its concerns to the convention floor, however. With more than a year to go before collective bargaining with the Big Three began anew, the convention did not address issues such as benefits, job security, and wages. =Retirement and death= \\"In a decade that was a nightmare for union leaders nationwide\\", as The New York Times described the 1980s, Bieber's performance at the collective bargaining table was generally considered exceptional.Lippert, \\"Retooling the UAW,\\" Detroit Free Press, August 1, 1994. Although he failed to force the Big Three to buy parts only from unionized companies, he was able to resist employer pressure for deep concessions. Bieber himself said his proudest moment came in 1990 with the establishment of the layoff income fund.Lippert, \\"UAW's Bieber Recalls 12 Years As Labor Chief\\", Detroit Free Press, May 18, 1995. But in the final year of his presidency, Bieber appeared exhausted by the duties of office. A reporter for the Detroit Free Press described him as tired and less vocal than he once was, and noted that the 64-year-old Bieber spent as much time as possible at his vacation home. Bieber retired in 1995, and Stephen Yokich succeeded him as UAW president.Bennet, \\"U.A.W., Ranks Thinning, Elects a Fighter as President\\", The New York Times, June 15, 1995. Bieber died on February 17, 2020, at age 90. Other activities Bieber was a self-described \\"staunch Democrat\\". However, he was unable to achieve agreement within the UAW over which of the many Democratic candidates to support in the presidential primaries.Toner, \\"Fading Influence for Divided U.A.W.,\\" New York Times, March 26, 1988. In 1992, Bieber was unable to win AFL-CIO support for a Democratic presidential primary candidate after his preferred candidate, Senator Tom Harkin, withdrew from the race in March 1992.\\"12 Union Heads Decide as Group Not to Endorse Any Candidate Yet,\\" New York Times, March 13, 1992. Bieber was elected to the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO shortly after assuming the UAW presidency, and served as chair of the Committee on Reindustrialization of the AFL-CIO Industrial Union Department.Smith, 1992, p. 316. However, in 1995 he was one of several AFL-CIO presidents who secretly worked to depose Lane Kirkland as president of the labor federation. The night before the AFL-CIO mid-winter executive council meeting in Bal Harbour, Florida, February 19‚Äì20, 1995, Bieber joined 11 other union presidents on the executive council to form a \\"Committee for Change\\" committed to removing Kirkland as president of the AFL-CIO.Kilborn, \\"Bringing Down Labor's Giant Leader,\\" New York Times, September 4, 1995. The 11 union leaders had enough votes to unseat Kirkland. During the executive council meeting, the group demanded that Kirkland resign or retire, but he refused.Swoboda, \\"Kirkland Faces Union Revolt,\\" Washington Post, May 10, 1995; Swoboda, \\"Lane Kirkland Signals He'll Fight to Keep Job,\\" Washington Post, February 21, 1995. Bieber strongly supported the successful candidacy of John Sweeney as his successor. Bieber stepped down as UAW president before the AFL-CIO quadrennial convention in August 1995, however, and left the actual job of electing a successor to Kirkland to Yokich. Bieber also served on the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations (an advisory committee of the federal government) and was a long-time member of the National Urban League. He also was a veteran member of the board of directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In this role, Bieber proved critical in the effort to remove William Gibson as chairman of the NAACP. Many members of the NAACP board wished to replace Gibson with Myrlie Evers-Williams, widow of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers. But Gibson's support on the board was still strong. Evers-Williams' supporters knew that Bieber wanted Gibson removed, but that Bieber rarely attended NAACP board meetings.Holmes, \\"Gibson Is Ousted as N.A.A.C.P. Head,\\" New York Times, February 19, 1995. Evers-Williams' backers persuaded Bieber that his attendance was critical to the vote, and he attended the meeting. Gibson was dismissed as president on February 18, 1995, by a vote of 30 to 29. Bieber was also heavily involved in his local community as well. He served on the board of directors of Project Rehab (a Michigan-based alcohol and drug rehabilitation service agency), the Michigan League for Human Services, West Michigan Comprehensive Health Planning Unit, the Michigan State Health Advisory Board, and the Michigan State Mental Health Board. He also was a member of the Personnel and Labor Advisory Council of Grand Valley State College.

Biography Portnova was born in Leningrad on February 20, 1926. She was the daughter of a working-class Belarusian family. Her father worked at the Kirov Plant. She was a seventh-grade student at the 385th school in Leningrad in 1941, when she left for her grandmother's house in the Vitebsk region. Not long afterwards, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. An incident with the invading Nazi troops, who hit her grandmother while they were confiscating the cattle, led her to hate the Germans. In 1942 Portnova joined the Belarusian resistance movement, becoming a member of the local underground Komsomol organization in Obol, Vitebsk Voblast, named Young Avengers. She began by distributing Soviet propaganda leaflets in the German-occupied Belarus, collecting and hiding weapons for Soviet soldiers, and reporting on German troop movements. After learning how to use weapons and explosives from the older members of the group, Portnova participated in sabotage actions at a pump, local power plant, and brick factory. These acts are estimated to have killed upwards of 100 German soldiers. In 1943, Portnova became employed as a kitchen aide in Obol. In August, she poisoned the food meant for the Nazi garrison stationed there. Immediately falling suspect, she said she was innocent and ate some of the food in front of the Nazis to prove it was not poisoned; after she did not fall ill immediately, they released her. Portnova became sick afterwards, vomiting heavily but eventually recovering from the poison after drinking much whey. After she did not return to work, the Germans realized she had been the culprit and started searching for her. To avoid the Germans, she became a scout of the partisan unit named after Kliment Voroshilov. In a letter sent to her parents that month, she wrote that she is \\"in partisan unit, beating the Nazis\\". In October 1943, Portnova joined the VLKSM. In December 1943 or January 1944 Portnova was sent back to Obol to infiltrate the garrison, discover the reason for the recent Young Avengers failures, then locate and contact the remaining members. She was quickly captured. Reports of her escape vary. One is that, during Gestapo interrogation in the village of Goriany, she took the investigator's pistol off the table, then shot and killed him. When two German soldiers entered after hearing the gunshots, she shot them as well. She then attempted to escape the compound and ran into the woods, where she was caught near the banks of a river. Another version is that the Gestapo interrogator, in a fit of rage, threw his pistol to the table after threatening to shoot her. Taking the pistol, Portnova shot him. Escaping through the door, she shot a guard in the corridor, then another in the courtyard. After the pistol misfired when Portnova attempted to shoot a guard blocking her access to the street, she was captured. After being recaptured, Portnova was tortured, possibly for information. She was later driven into the forest and executed or killed during torture on 15 January 1944. Legacy On 1 July 1958, Portnova was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. She also received the Order of Lenin. In 1969, the village of Zuya dedicated a commemorative plaque in her honour. She also had numerous Young Pioneer groups named in her honour. Portnova has had many school teams and groups named after her, as well the museum to the Komsomol, situated on the highway between Polotsk and Vitebsk, and a school in St. Petersburg. There are two monuments to her, a bust in Minsk and an obelisk in the village of Obol. See also * List of female Heroes of the Soviet Union Notes References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= *.

The crane division was sold to Herbert Morris of Loughborough in 1928, with the crane work being transferred to Loughborough in 1931. In 1939, the company purchased the Victoria Works in Saxon Street, Denton from Knight & Hale. The Machine tool division at Reddish remained in business until 1966. In 1966 Metropolitan-Cammell absorbed the railway rolling stock business of Cravens. In 1967 the remaining rolling stock business switched to making shipping containers under the name Cravens Homalloy. The engineering division became Bone-Cravens and made plastic extrusion and plastic moulding machines.Tools to finish all jobs. The Times, Monday, 10 November 1969; pg.

The Times, Monday, 7 January 1884; pg. 11; Issue 31023 Craven's built many diagrams of coaching stock for the pre-grouping Railway companies of Great Britain, the grouped companies and for British Railways itself. They also constructed coaches for many railway companies around the world. As well as surface running stock they also built vehicles for underground railways and especially noted are the London Underground A60 Stock. With modernisation the company adapted to build diesel multiple units and electric multiple units for British Railways. One of its last orders, in 1963, was of 55 mainline carriages, broadly similar to the British Railways Mark 1 design, for the Irish railway company C√≥ras Iompair √âireann. Another of the orders received and completed before the absorption by Metro Cammell was a royal train for Peru. =Second World War= Craven's made airframe components and maintained supply of road and rail vehicles for the Admiralty and Ministry of Supply including: limbers, gun shields, gun mountings, gun turrets, rocket ammunition racks, ammunition boxes, and components for armoured vehicles. =Asbestos sound insulation= Many employees in the railway industry in general developed diseases related to asbestos, used during the locomotive and carriage building process. These diseases include peritoneal mesothelioma, lung cancer, asbestosis, diffuse pleural thickening and other pleural abnormalities. Some ex Cravens employees have been awarded significant compensation in such cases but some families received relatively small amounts of compensation. One of the methods of working employed at Craven's was shooting a wet slurry of asbestos from a pressure gun. The operators would stand under a railway car supported on large trestles and spray the asbestos slurry in a layer onto the underside of the railway car. This was done to provide sound insulation to the floor of the railway car prior to final assembly. Problems with asbestos in Craven's stock continued for many years. Craven's standard stock cars 4906 to 4909 were withdrawn from service in 1975 and 1976, and the schedule for their replacement suffered severe delays due to the discovery of asbestos in some of the Driving Motor cars. Because of this, it was 1983 before all the standard stock cars were replaced. =Ireland= In spring 1961 CI√â (National Railway Company of Ireland) sought tenders for the supply of 40 new Standard Class coaches, 10 to be delivered complete, the rest \\"part-finished\\" for assembly in Inchicore, Dublin, with technical assistance from the suppliers. The ¬£500,000 contract was awarded to Cravens of Sheffield.¬£¬ΩM. Railway Contract. The Times, Tuesday, 14 August 1962; pg. 13; Issue 55469 It was reported that these new vehicles \\"would set a pattern for future construction of CI√â carriage stock.\\" The first of the Sheffield-built coaches was unloaded at the North Wall, Dublin on 3 May 1963 and taken to Inchicore for acceptance. These saw long service, the last not being withdrawn from main line service until 2006 and some are preserved by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland. Preserved Craven's rolling stock Craven's trains are preserved by the Craven Heritage Train group. One carriage built by Cravens for the Metropolitan Railway in 1892 (No353) is preserved by the London Transport Museum. Another built in 1900 is preserved on the Bluebell Railway in Sussex. Ex-Iarnr√≥d √âireann (which operated Ireland's railways after CI√â was split up in 1987) Craven Carriage Numbers 1505, 1506, 1508, 1514, 1522, 1523, 1529, 1532, 1539 and 1541 have been preserved in regular use by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI). They are used on their Dublin area excursions. The body of No.1558 is preserved at a pub in Naas County Kildare. Cravens also built four 40-tonne capacity steam cranes for the New Zealand Railways in the late 1930s. One of these, NO 200 (TMS EL 4007), was purchased for preservation by Euan McQueen of the Rail Heritage Trust in 1990 while it was in storage. The crane was transferred to Steam Incorporated's Paekakariki depot in 1993. The crane was being restored by the Craven Crane Group, although it is listed in a roster of preserved railway and tramway equipment as having been transferred to Steam Inc ownership in 2009. It is at present under overhaul, having last operated in the late 1980s. Two of Craven's Class 105 diesel multiple unit cars, numbers 51485 and 56121 are now owned by and have been restored to \\"as new\\" condition by the East Lancashire Railway.

Publication history  Foxy Grandpa made its first appearance on January 7, 1900. The strip initially ran in the New York Herald, but it moved to the New York American on February 16, 1902. In 1912, the strip began being distributed by the C. J. Mar Syndicate, lasting until 1918. The typeset Foxy Grandpa's Stories, distributed by International Features Service, Inc., began April 2, 1923. Foxy Grandpa was the narrator, appearing in a one-panel cartoon at the top of each column. This feature lasted well into the 1930s. In 1929, the strip appeared in America's early comic book The Funnies. Characters and story The strip revolved around Foxy Grandpa, an elderly gentleman, with two mischievous grandsons (Chub and Bunt) who constantly try to trick him. Foxy Grandpa, however, always managed to get the better of the two boys, combining brains with a perverse sense of humor, while demonstrating skills at acrobatics, illustration and construction of various small devices. The comic was drawn in text comic style, with the text and dialogue written underneath the images.  In other media  The strip was adapted to Broadway shows and early silent films (with Foxy Grandpa played by stage performer Joseph Hart).

Particularly since World War I, advanced science-based technologies have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military. World War I is often called \\"the chemists‚Äô war\\", both for the extensive use of poison gas and the importance of nitrates and advanced high explosives. Poison gas, beginning in 1915 with chlorine from the powerful German dye industry, was used extensively by the Germans and the British ; over the course of the war, scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.Harris, Robert and Jeremy Paxman. A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare. 2002. Chapter 1. Physicists also contributed to the war effort, developing wireless communication technologies and sound-based methods of detecting U-boats, resulting in the first tenuous long-term connections between academic science and the military.Kevles, Daniel J. The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America. New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1971. pp 137-138. World War II marked a massive increase in the military funding of science, particularly physics. In addition to the Manhattan Project and the resulting atomic bomb, British and American work on radar was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based proximity fuze. Mathematical cryptography, meteorology, and rocket science were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline. The technologies employed at the end--jet aircraft, radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bomb--were radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars. The advent of the Cold War solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the United States and the Soviet Union, so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand. Funding spread to the social sciences as well as the natural sciences, and whole new fields, such as digital computing, were born of military patronage. Following the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American military-scientific complex remains in place. The sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding, especially for American science. Since Paul Forman‚Äôs 1987 article ‚ÄúBehind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,‚Äù there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.Forman, Paul. \\"Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960,\\" Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences, Vol. 18, Pt. 1, pp 149-229. Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science‚Äîparticularly physics‚Äîtoward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners. An alternate view has been presented by Daniel Kevles, that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy. Science and military technology before the modern era Replica catapult at Ch√¢teau des Baux, France While there were numerous instances of military support for scientific work before the 20th century, these were typically isolated instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the development of science than scientific knowledge was to technological innovation.Hacker, Barton C. \\"The Machines of War: Western Military Technology 1850-2000.\\" History and Technology, Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2005, pp 255-300. p 255. Thermodynamics, for example, is a science partly born from military technology: one of the many sources of the first law of thermodynamics was Count Rumford‚Äôs observation of the heat produced by boring cannon barrels.von Baeyer, Hans Christian. Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat. New York: The Modern Library, 1998. Mathematics was important in the development of the Greek catapult and other weapons,Hacker, \\"The Machines of War,\\" footnote 1. but analysis of ballistics was also important for the development of mathematics, while Galileo tried to promote the telescope as a military instrument to the military-minded Republic of Venice before turning it to the skies while seeking the patronage of the Medici court in Florence.Biagioli, Mario. Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993. In general, craft-based innovation, disconnected from the formal systems of science, was the key to military technology well into the 19th century. Interchangeable gun parts, illustrated in the 1832 Edinburgh Encyclopaedia Even craft-based military technologies were not generally produced by military funding. Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought the interest of military patrons afterward.Hacker, \\"The Machines of War,\\" p 256. Following the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success. In the decades leading up to the French Revolution, French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons manufacture from a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and interchangeable parts (pre-dating the work of Eli Whitney in the U.S.). During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create ‚Äúweapons more powerful than any we possess‚Äù to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work.Gillispie, Charles Coulston. \\"Science and secret weapons development in Revolutionary France, 1792‚Äì1804.\\" Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp 35‚Äì152. Quote from excerpt of Georges Cuvier‚Äôs eulogy of Claude-Louis Berthollet, p 35. Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results. A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship's longitude at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote‚Äîand financially reward‚Äîa scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker John Harrison.Sobel, Dava. Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time. Penguin, 1996. However, the naval utility of astronomy did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments. Through the 19th century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical and acoustic inventions and the corresponding mathematical theories. The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a trend toward military mechanization, with the advent of repeating rifles with smokeless powder, long-range artillery, high explosives, machine guns, and mechanized transport along with telegraphic and later wireless battlefield communication. Still, independent inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these drastic changes in military technology (with the exception of the development of battleships, which could only have been created through organized large-scale effort).Hacker, ‚ÄúThe Machines of War,‚Äù pp 256-257. World War I and the interwar years World War I marked the first large-scale mobilization of science for military purposes. Prior to the war, the American military ran a few small laboratories as well as the Bureau of Standards, but independent inventors and industrial firms predominated.Kevles, The Physicists, pp 103-104. Similarly in Europe, military-directed scientific research and development was minimal. The powerful new technologies that led to trench warfare, however, reversed the traditional advantage of fast-moving offensive tactics; fortified positions supported by machine guns and artillery resulted in high attrition but strategic stalemate. Militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even newer technologies, but the introduction of tanks and aircraft had only a marginal impact; the use of poison gas made a tremendous psychological impact, but decisively favored neither side. The war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate supplies of materials, a problem also addressed by military-funded science--and, through the international chemical industry, closely related to the advent of chemical warfare. The Germans introduced gas as a weapon in part because naval blockades limited their supply of nitrate for explosives, while the massive German dye industry could easily produce chlorine and organic chemicals in large amounts. Industrial capacity was completely mobilized for war, and Fritz Haber and other industrial scientists were eager to contribute to the German cause; soon they were closely integrated into the military hierarchy as they tested the most effective ways of producing and delivering weaponized chemicals. Though the initial impetus for gas warfare came from outside the military, further developments in chemical weapon technology might be considered military-funded, considering the blurring of lines between industry and nation in Germany.Harris and Paxman, A Higher Form of Killing, pp 11-12. Poison gas casualties from the Battle of Estaires, April 10, 1918 Following the first chlorine attack by the Germans in May 1915, the British quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing their own gas weapons. Gas research escalated on both sides, with chlorine followed by phosgene, a variety of tear gases, and mustard gas. A wide array of research was conducted on the physiological effects of other gases, such and hydrogen cyanide, arsenic compounds, and a host of complex organic chemicals. The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at Porton Down, which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century. Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved. In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive research environment for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apace--though in secret--through the interwar years and into World War II. German military- backed gas warfare research did not resume until the Nazi era, following the 1936 discovery of tabun, the first nerve agent, through industrial insecticide research. In the United States, the established tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the rising discipline of physics for World War I military largess. A host of inventors, led by Thomas Edison and his newly created Naval Consulting Board, cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military problems and aid the war effort, while academic scientists worked through the National Research Council (NRC) led by Robert Millikan. Submarine detection was the most important problem that both the physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as German U-boats were decimating the crucial naval supply lines from the U.S. to England. Edison's Board produced very few useful innovations, but NRC research resulted in a moderately successful sound-based methods for locating submarines and hidden ground-based artillery, as well as useful navigational and photographic equipment for aircraft. Because of the success of academic science in solving specific military problems, the NRC was retained after the war's end, though it gradually decoupled from the military.Kevles, The Physicists, pp 102-154 Many industrial and academic chemists and physicists came under military control during the Great War, but post-war research by the Royal Engineers Experimental Station at Porton Down and the continued operation of the National Research Council were exceptions to the overall pattern; wartime chemistry funding was a temporary redirection of a field largely driven by industry and later medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the military. The discipline of modern meteorology, however, was largely built from military funding. During World War I, the French civilian meteorological infrastructure was largely absorbed into the military. The introduction of military aircraft during the war as well as the role of wind and weather in the success or failure of gas attacks meant meteorological advice was in high demand. The French army (among others) created its own supplementary meteorological service as well, retraining scientists from other fields to staff it. At war's end, the military continued to control French meteorology, sending weathermen to French colonial interests and integrating weather service with the growing air corps; most of the early- twentieth century growth in European meteorology was the direct result of military funding.Pyenson, Lewis and Susan Sheets-Pyenson. Servants of Nature: A History of Scientific Institutions, Enterprises, and Sensibilities. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999. pp 309-311. World War II would result in a similar transformation of American meteorology, initiating a transition from an apprenticeship system for training weathermen (based on intimate knowledge of local trends and geography) to the university-based, science-intensive system that has predominated since. World War II If World War I was the chemists‚Äô war, World War II was the physicists‚Äô war. As with other total wars, it is difficult to draw a line between military funding and more spontaneous military-scientific collaboration during World War II. Well before the Invasion of Poland, nationalism was a powerful force in the German physics community (see Deutsche Physik); the military mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the rise of National Socialism. German and Allied investigations of the possibility of a nuclear bomb began in 1939 at the initiative of civilian scientists, but by 1942 the respective militaries were heavily involved. The German nuclear energy project had two independent teams, a civilian-controlled team under Werner Heisenberg and a military-controlled led by Kurt Diebner; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a bomb (as opposed to a power reactor) and received much more funding from the Nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.The extent to which Heisenberg‚Äôs team was devoted to aiding the Nazi‚Äôs by producing an atomic bomb is a matter of some historical dispute. However, most recent scholarship suggests that the stagnation of the German project stemmed from Heisenberg‚Äôs doubts about the feasibility rather than the desirability of a Nazi bomb. See: Rose, Paul Lawrence. Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. In the U.S., the Manhattan Project and other projects of the Office of Scientific Research and Development resulted in a much more extensive military-scientific venture, the scale of which dwarfed previous military-funded research projects. Theoretical work by a number of British and American scientists resulted in significant optimism about the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction. As the physicists convinced military leaders of the potential of nuclear weapons, funding for actual development was ratcheted up rapidly. A number of large laboratories were created across the United States for work on different aspects of the bomb, while many existing facilities were reoriented to bomb-related work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the military.Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of Chicago‚Äôs Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory), Hanford Site (now defunct), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory were all created during the Manhattan Project, while Berkeley‚Äôs Radiation Laboratory and smaller labs across the country became part of the project as well. Among others, see: Smyth, Henry DeWolf. Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-1945. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1945. Rhodes, Richard. The Making of the Atomic Bomb. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1986. The May 1945 surrender of Germany, the original intended target for the bomb, did virtually nothing to slow the project's momentum. After Japan's surrender immediately following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, many scientists returned to academia or industry, but the Manhattan Project infrastructure was too large‚Äîand too effective‚Äîto be dismantled wholesale; it became the model for future military-scientific work, in the U.S. and elsewhere.Kevles, The Physicists, pp. 324-348. Other wartime physics research, particularly in rocketry and radar technology, was less significant in popular culture but much more significant for the outcome of the war. German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of Wunderwaffen, resulting in the V-2 ballistic missile; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research. Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war. German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; jet aircraft also went into service by the end of the war.Hacker, The Machines of War, p. 263. Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies. British physicists pioneered long-wave radar, developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces. Work on potentially more precise short-wave radar was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in microwave radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations. Further refinement of microwave technology led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers. Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research. American Cold War science In the years immediately following World War II, the military was by far the most significant patron of university science research in the U.S., and the national labs also continued to flourish.Geiger, Roger. \\"Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970,\\" Osiris (2nd series), Vol. 7, 1992, Science after '40, pp 26-48. p 26. After two years in political limbo (but with work on nuclear power and bomb manufacture continuing apace) the Manhattan Project became a permanent arm of the government as the Atomic Energy Commission. The Navy‚Äîinspired by the success of military-directed wartime research‚Äîcreated its own R&D; organization, the Office of Naval Research, which would preside over an expanded long-term research program at Naval Research Laboratory as well as fund a variety of university-based research. Military money following up the wartime radar research led to explosive growth in both electronics research and electronics manufacturing.Forman, \\"Behind quantum electronics,\\" pp 159-160. The Air Force became an independent service branch from the Army and established its own research and development system, and the Army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic science than the Navy or Air Force). Meanwhile, the perceived communist menace of the Soviet Union caused tensions‚Äîand military budgets‚Äîto escalate rapidly. The Department of Defense primarily funded what has been broadly described as ‚Äúphysical research,‚Äù but to reduce this to merely chemistry and physics is misleading. Military patronage benefited a large number of fields, and in fact helped create a number of the modern scientific disciplines. At Stanford and MIT, for example, electronics, aerospace engineering, nuclear physics, and materials science--all physics, broadly speaking--each developed in different directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent disciplines as they grew and pursued defense-related research agendas. What began as interdepartmental laboratories became the centers for graduate teaching and research innovation thanks to the broad scope of defense funding. The need to keep up with corporate technology research (which was receiving the lion's share of defense contracts) also prompted many science labs to establish close relationships with industry.Leslie, Stuart. The Cold War and American Science: The Military- Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993. =Computing= The complex histories of computer science and computer engineering were shaped, in the first decades of digital computing, almost entirely by military funding. Most of the basic component technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running Whirlwind-SAGE program to develop an automated radar shield. Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies by the end of the 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility. More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a Cold War military perspective. Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on psychology, cognitive science and neuroscience through the mind- computer analogy.Edwards, Paul The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996. =Geosciences and astrophysics= The history of earth science and the history of astrophysics were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War. American geodesy, oceanography, and seismology grew from small sub- disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense. A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the figure of the Earth, the model of the earth's geography and gravitation that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles. In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program CORONA, while military reconnaissance was in fact a driving force. Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience. Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough to make use of the findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy.Cloud, John. \\"Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic-Complex, 1947-1972,\\" Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, pp 371-404. 2000 Cloud, John. \\"Imaging the World in a Barrel: CORONA and the Clandestine Convergence of the Earth Sciences,\\" Social Studies of Science, Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 231-251. April 2001. Like geodesy and satellite photography research, the advent of radio astronomy had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda. Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe and--using the same equipment and technology--the monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.van Keuren, David K. \\"Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62,\\" Social Studies of Science, Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 207-229. April 2001. Military interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some ways a result of the defense-related payoffs of physics and geodesy. The immediate goal of funding in these fields was to detect clandestine nuclear testing and track fallout radiation, a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the nuclear weapon technology earlier military research had created. In particular, the feasibility of monitoring underground nuclear explosions was crucial to the possibility of a comprehensive rather than Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.Barth, Kai-Henrik. \\"The Politics of Seismology: Nuclear Testing, Arms Control, and the Transformation of a Discipline,\\" Social Studies of Science, Vol. 33, No. 5, pp 743-781. October 2003. But the military-funded growth of these disciplines continued even when no pressing military goals were driving them; as with other natural sciences, the military also found value in having ‚Äòscientists on tap‚Äô for unforeseen future R&D; needs.Mukerji, Chandra. A Fragile Power: Scientists and the State. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990. =Biological sciences= The biological sciences were also affected by military funding, but, with the exception of nuclear physics-related medical and genetic research, largely indirectly. The most significant funding sources for basic research before the rise of the military-industrial-academic complex were philanthropic organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation. After World War II (and to some extent before), the influx of new industrial and military funding opportunities for the physical sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics research--most early work in high-energy physics and biophysics had been the product of foundation grants--and refocus on biological and medical research. The social sciences also found limited military support from the 1940s to the 1960s, but much defense-minded social science research could be‚Äîand was‚Äîpursued without extensive military funding. In the 1950s, social scientists tried to emulate the interdisciplinary organizational success of the physical sciences‚Äô Manhattan Project with the synthetic behavioral science movement.Though somewhat related, \\"behavioral science\\" in this context should not be confused with the behavioral sciences or behaviorism, the strictly mechanistic approach to psychology promoted by B. F. Skinner. See: Robin, Ron. The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001. Social scientists actively sought to promote their usefulness to the military, researching topics related to propaganda (put to use in Korea), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of communism, and a broad constellation of other topics of Cold War significance. By the 1960s, economists and political scientists offered up modernization theory for the cause of Cold War nation-building; modernization theory found a home in the military in the form of Project Camelot, a study of the process of revolution, as well as in the Kennedy administration‚Äôs approach to the Vietnam War. Project Camelot was ultimately canceled because of the concerns it raised about scientific objectivity in the context of such a politicized research agenda; though natural sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the corrupting influence of military and political factors, the social sciences were.For modernization theory, and its role in the Vietnam War, see: Latham, Michael E. Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and \\"Nation-Building\\" in the Kennedy Era. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000.

Historical debate Historian Paul Forman, in his seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated \\"a qualitative change in its purposes and character.\\"Forman, \\"Behind quantum electronics,\\" p 150. Historians of science were beginning to turn to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman's ‚Äúdistortionist critique‚Äù (as Roger Geiger has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates.Geiger, Roger. \\"Review of The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford,\\" Technology and Culture, Vol. 34 pp 629-631. 1994. Forman and others (e.g., Robert Seidel, Stuart Leslie, and for the history of the social sciences, Ron Robin) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research. In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with Daniel Kevles, deny that the military \\"seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'.\\"Kevles, Daniel J. \\"Cold war and hot physics: Science, security, and the American state, 1945-56,\\" Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences, Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 239-264. 1990. Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent‚Äîrather than put to alternate scientific use.Geiger, ‚ÄúScience, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970.‚Äù See also: Geiger, Roger. Knowledge & Money: Research Universities and the Paradox of the Marketplace. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004. In Geiger‚Äôs broad analysis of the relationship between political economy and academic research, the character and purpose of funding sources play little role, and there is no discussion of the distinctiveness of military funding. Rather, such funding is significant only in the context of ‚Äòcrowding out‚Äô other economic forces. Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.Hounshell, David A. \\"Epilogue: Rethinking the Cold War; Rethinking Science and Technology in the Cold War; Rethinking the Social Study of Science and Technology,\\" Social Studies of Science, Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 289-297.

She later attended the American School Foundation in Mexico City, Princeton University, and New York University. She has made many prize-winning short and feature-length films. Early life and education Born in the Netherlands on July 24, 1974, raised in Mexico City, and now living in New York City, Aridjis is the daughter of the Greek-Mexican writer, Homero Aridjis, and the American environmental activist and translator, Betty Ferber de Aridjis. Her sister is writer Chloe Aridjis. Aridjis left Mexico City when she was 18 to study Anthropology and Comparative Literature at Princeton University, where she wrote her thesis on the concepts of the self and other in the works of Borges, Cort√°zar, Baudelaire and Lacan. She also took all of the film classes on offer, and worked as Professor P. Adams Sitney's assistant for three years. She then earned an MFA in Film and Television at New York University (1996‚Äì2001), where she focused on directing and writing.

Automated 4 aisle miniload warehouse with single mast stacker cranes. An automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS or AS/RS) consists of a variety of computer-controlled systems for automatically placing and retrieving loads from defined storage locations. Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) are typically used in applications where: * There is a very high volume of loads being moved into and out of storage * Storage density is important because of space constraints * No value is added in this process (no processing, only storage and transport) * Accuracy is critical because of potential expensive damages to the load An AS/RS can be used with standard loads as well as nonstandard loads, meaning that each standard load can fit in a uniformly-sized volume; for example the film canisters in the image of the Defense Visual Information Center are each stored as part of the contents of the uniformly sized metal boxes, which are shown in the image. Standard loads simplify the handling of a request of an item. In addition, audits of the accuracy of the inventory of contents can be restricted to the contents of an individual metal box, rather than undergoing a top-to-bottom search of the entire facility, for a single item.  Overview  ASRS with input on ground level ASRS are also used in libraries allowing for greater safety when consulting and retrieving books. AS/RS systems are designed for automated storage and retrieval of parts and items in manufacturing, distribution, retail, wholesale and institutions. They first originated in the 1960s, initially focusing on heavy pallet loads but with the evolution of the technology the handled loads have become smaller. The systems operate under computerized control, maintaining an inventory of stored items. Retrieval of items is accomplished by specifying the item type and quantity to be retrieved. The computer determines where in the storage area the item can be retrieved from and schedules the retrieval. It directs the proper automated storage and retrieval machine (SRM) to the location where the item is stored and directs the machine to deposit the item at a location where it is to be picked up. A system of conveyors and or automated guided vehicles is sometimes part of the AS/RS system. These take loads into and out of the storage area and move them to the manufacturing floor or loading docks. To store items, the pallet or tray is placed at an input station for the system, the information for inventory is entered into a computer terminal and the AS/RS system moves the load to the storage area, determines a suitable location for the item, and stores the load. As items are stored into or retrieved from the racks, the computer updates its inventory accordingly. The benefits of an AS/RS system include reduced labor for transporting items into and out of inventory, reduced inventory levels, more accurate tracking of inventory, and space savings. Items are often stored more densely than in systems where items are stored and retrieved manually. Within the storage, items can be placed on trays or hang from bars, which are attached to chains/drives in order to move up and down. The equipment required for an AS/RS include a storage & retrieval machine (SRM) that is used for rapid storage and retrieval of material. SRMs are used to move loads vertically or horizontally, and can also move laterally to place objects in the correct storage location. The trend towards Just In Time production often requires sub-pallet level availability of production inputs, and AS/RS is a much faster way of organizing the storage of smaller items next to production lines. Material Handling Institute of America (MHIA), the non-profit trade association for the material handling world, and its members have broken AS/RS into two primary segments: Fixed Aisle and Carousels/Vertical Lift Modules (VLMs). Both sets of technologies provide automated storage and retrieval for parts and items, but use different technologies. Each technology has its unique set of benefits and disadvantages. Fixed Aisle systems are characteristically larger systems whereas carousels and Vertical Lift Modules are used individually or grouped, but in small to medium-sized applications. A fixed-aisle AS/R machine (stacker crane) is one of two main designs: single-masted or double masted. Most are supported on a track and ceiling guided at the top by guide rails or channels to ensure accurate vertical alignment, although some are suspended from the ceiling. The 'shuttles' that make up the system travel between fixed storage shelves to deposit or retrieve a requested load (ranging from a single book in a library system to a several ton pallet of goods in a warehouse system). The entire unit moves horizontally within an aisle, while the shuttles are able to elevate up to the necessary height to reach the load, and can extend and retract to store or retrieve loads that are several positions deep in the shelving. A semi-automated system can be achieved by utilizing only specialized shuttles within an existing rack system. Automated storage and retrieval system using the highly dynamic TGW Stingray shuttle technology. Another AS/RS technology is known as shuttle technology. In this technology the horizontal movement is made by independent shuttles each operating on one level of the rack while a lift at a fixed position within the rack is responsible for the vertical movement. By using two separate machines for these two axes the shuttle technology is able to provide higher throughput rates than stacker cranes. Storage and Retrieval Machines pick up or drop off loads to the rest of the supporting transportation system at specific stations, where inbound and outbound loads are precisely positioned for proper handling. In addition, there are several types of Automated Storage & Retrieval Systems (AS/RS) devices called Unit-load AS/RS, Mini-load AS/RS, Mid-Load AS/RS, Vertical Lift Modules (VLMs), Horizontal Carousels and Vertical Carousels. These systems are used either as stand-alone units or in integrated workstations called pods or systems. These units are usually integrated with various types of pick to light systems and use either a microprocessor controller for basic usage or inventory management software. These systems are ideal for increasing space utilization up to 90%, productivity levels by 90%, accuracy to 99.9%+ levels and throughput up to 750 lines per hour/per operator or more depending on the configuration of the system.  Advantages  An effective automated storage and retrieval system provides several benefits for [supply chain management] * An efficient AS/RS system helps companies cut expenses by minimizing the amount of unnecessary parts and products in storage, and improving organization of the contents of a warehouse. Due to automated processes, it also allows for more storage space due to high-density storage, narrower aisles, etc. *Automation reduces labor costs while lowering workforce requirements and increasing safety. * Modeling and managing the logical representation of the physical storage facilities (e.g. racking, etc.). For example, if certain products are often sold together or are more popular than others, those products can be grouped together or placed near the delivery area to speed up the process of picking, packing and shipping to customers. * Enabling a seamless link to order processing and logistics management in order to pick, pack, and ship product out of the facility. * Tracking where products are stocked, which suppliers they come from, and the length of time they are stored. By analyzing such data, companies can control inventory levels and maximize the use of warehouse space. Furthermore, firms are more prepared for the demands and supplies of the market, especially during special circumstances such as a peak season on a particular month. Through the reports generated by an AS/RS system, firms are also able to gather important data that may be put in a model for it to be analyzed.  Vertical lift module  VLMs can be built quite high to match the available overhead space in a facility. Multiple units can be placed in 'pods' whereby an operator can retrieve items from one unit while the other units are moving. Variants include width, height, load, speed and a control system. The VLM is a board controlled automated vertical lift module. Inventory within the VLM is stored on front and rear tray locations or rails. When a tray is requested, either by entering a tray number in the built-in control pad or by requesting a part through software, an extractor travels vertically between the two columns of trays and pulls the requested tray from its location and brings it to an access point. The operator then picks or replenishes stock and the tray is returned to its home upon confirmation. VLM systems are sold in numerous configurations, which could be applied in different industries, logistics, as well as office settings. The VLM systems could be customized to fully utilize the height of the facility, even through multiple floors. With the capability of multiple access openings on different floors, the VLM system is able to provide an innovative storage and retrieval solution. The rapid movement of the extractor, as well as inventory management software, can dramatically increase the efficiency of the picking process. This occurs by simultaneously retrieving and storing trays in multiple units. Unlike large AS/RS systems, which require a complete overhaul of the warehouse or production line, the vertical lift modules are modularized, which can be easily integrated into the existing system, or to be rolled out in gradually over different phases. Most common applications include: MRO, order picking, consolidation, kitting, parts handling, buffering, inventory storage, WIP, buffer storage, and many more. VLMs provide floor space savings, increased labor productivity and picking accuracy, improved worker ergonomics, and controlled process. Most VLMs offer dynamic space storage which measures the tray every time it is returned to the unit to optimize space, safety features and some offer tilt tray delivery for increased ergonomic accessibility, and laser pointers which indicate the exact item to be picked on each tray.  Horizontal carousels  A horizontal carousel is a series of bins which revolve on an oval track. Every bin has shelves which are adjustable to .75\\" and can be configured for a myriad of standard and special applications. An operator simply inputs a bin number, part number or cell location and the carousel will rotate via the shortest path. Multiple horizontal carousels integrated with pick to light technology and inventory management software (a pod of carousels) are used for order fulfillment. A wave of orders are sent to the pod. A group of orders are selected to create a batch. The operator simply follows the lights and pick round robin from the carousels and place items in a batch station behind them. Each carousel pre-positions and rotates when picked. By applying the \\"product to person\\" principle, operators do not have to move from their position to prepare the order. When the batch is complete, a new batch is inducted and the process repeated until the wave is complete. Horizontal carousels can save up to 75% of floorspace, increase productivity by 2/3, accuracy levels to 99.9%+ levels and throughput up to 750 lines per hour/operator. Horizontal carousel systems generally outperform robotic systems for a fraction of the cost. Horizontal carousels are the most cost effective AS/RS system available. Robotic Inserter/Extractor devices can also be used for horizontal carousels. The robotic device is positioned in the front or rear of up to three horizontal carousels tiered high. The robot grabs the tote required in the order and often replenishes at the same time to speed up throughput. The tote(s) are then delivered to conveyor which routes it to a work station for picking or replenishing. Up to eight transactions per minute per unit can be done. Totes or containers up to 36\\" x 36\\" x 36\\" can be used in a system. On a simplistic level, horizontal carousels are also often used as \\"rotating shelving.\\" 'With simple \\"fetch\\" command items are brought to the operator and otherwise wasted space is eliminated. AS/RS Applications: Most applications of AS/RS technology have been associated with warehousing and distribution operations. An AS/RS can also be used to store raw materials and work in process in manufacturing. Three application areas can be distinguished for AS/RS: (1) Unit load storage and handling, (2) Order picking, and (3) Work in process storage. Unit load storage and retrieval applications are represented by unit load AS/RS and deep-lane storage systems. These kinds of applications are commonly found in warehousing for finishing goods in a distribution centre, rarely in manufacturing. Deep-lane systems are used in the food industry. As described above, order picking involves retrieving materials in less than full unit load quantities. Minilpass, man-on board, and items retrieval systems are used for this second application area. Work in process storage is a more recent application of automated storage technology. While it is desirable to minimize the amount of work in process, WIP is unavoidable and must be effectively managed. Automated storage systems, either automated storage/retrieval systems or carousel systems, represent an efficient way to store materials between processing steps, particularly in batch and job shop production. In high production, work in process is often carried between operations by conveyor system, which this serve both storage and transport functions. =Installed applications= Installed applications of this technology can be wide-ranging. In some libraries, such as at University of Nevada, Reno library, such a system is employed to retrieve books. Still others in use involve retrieval of bicycles from a bicycle tree, as in the case of systems in Japan.

All of the next AS/RS types are designed around a horizontal aisle. The same principle of using a center aisle to access loads is used except that the aisle is vertical. Vertical lift storage modules, some with heights of 10 meters or more, are capable of holding large inventories while saving valuable floor space in the factory. * Unit load stackers - The unit load stackers is typically a large automated system designed to handle unit loads stored on pallets or in other standard containers. The system is computer controlled, and the S/R machines are automated and designed to handle the unit load containers. * ASRS Gantry Robots - These are a type of Automated Storage/Retrieval Systems used in warehousing and logistics sectors. Some common uses for these are in the Tire Industry for stacking tire inventory. Most of these systems span 50‚Äì60 ft in width and average 200‚Äì300 feet in length. These systems use End Effectors a.k.a. End of Arm Tooling to pick and place the tire stacks from conveyors.http://sagerobot.com/robotic-ssr  Man-aboard systems  A man- aboard system can provide significant floorspace savings over manual or forklift operations but is not truly an AS/RS, as the operation is still manual. Storage system heights are not limited by the reach height of the order picker, as the picker rides along on the platform as it is moved vertically or horizontally to the various storage locations. Shelves or storage cabinets can be stacked as high as floor loading, weight capacity, throughput requirements, and/or ceiling heights will permit. Man-aboard storage and retrieval systems are far and away the most expensive picker-to- stock equipment alternative but are less expensive than a fully automated system. Aisle-captive storage/retrieval machines reaching heights up to 40 feet cost around $125,000. Hence, there must be enough storage density and/or productivity improvement over cart and tote picking to justify the investment. Also, because vertical travel is slow compared to horizontal travel, typical picking rates in man-aboard operations range between 40 and 250 lines per person-hour. The range is large because there is a wide variety of operating schemes for man-aboard systems. Man-aboard systems are typically appropriate for slow-moving items where space is fairly expensive.

Her father, Jan Petronski, reveals that due to the constant discrimination directed at his family they must leave town. The teacher holds a drawing contest in which the girls are to draw dresses of their own design. Wanda enters and submits one hundred beautiful designs. Her classmates are in awe of her talent and realize that these were her hundred dresses. The students who teased her feel remorse and want her to know this, but they are not sure how. They decide to write her a kind letter and send it to her old address, hoping the post office can forward it. Unfortunately, she has already moved away and does not realize she won the contest.Kathleen T. Horning, Association for Library Service to Children, The Newbery & Caldecott Awards: A Guide to the Medal and Honor Books, Chicago: American Library Association, 2009, , p. 68.

Its algebraic and topological structures are the group direct product and product topology over the cyclic group of order 2 (which is itself given the discrete topology). If A is a countably infinite set, the corresponding Cantor cube is a Cantor space. Cantor cubes are special among compact groups because every compact group is a continuous image of one, although usually not a homomorphic image. (The literature can be unclear, so for safety, assume all spaces are Hausdorff.) Topologically, any Cantor cube is: *homogeneous; *compact; *zero-dimensional; *AE(0), an absolute extensor for compact zero-dimensional spaces. (Every map from a closed subset of such a space into a Cantor cube extends to the whole space.) By a theorem of Schepin, these four properties characterize Cantor cubes; any space satisfying the properties is homeomorphic to a Cantor cube. In fact, every AE(0) space is the continuous image of a Cantor cube, and with some effort one can prove that every compact group is AE(0). It follows that every zero-dimensional compact group is homeomorphic to a Cantor cube, and every compact group is a continuous image of a Cantor cube.

Although Anton Andersson Asther had promised Hildagard Augusta √Ökerlund aka Hilda √Ökerlund marriage, she however was unwed when she gave birth to Nils in Sankt Matth√¶us parish in the Copenhagen borough of Vesterbro where she stayed very briefly. Thus, due to the marriage promise, technically, Nils was not an illegitimate child. (Also: when the parents married, a note was made of Anton¬¥s official acknowledgement of the boy.) He spent his first year as a foster child in Hyllie, Sweden with saddlemaker Rasmus Hellstr√∂m and wife Emilia Kristina M√∂ller. He was christened in Hyllie on February 26, 1897 before moving in with his biological parents who had married on May 29, 1898 in Malm√∂. His half-brother Gunnar Anton Asther (born March 4, 1892 in Caroli, Malm√∂) was his father's child from a previous marriage to Anna Paulina Olander, who had died in July 1895. Asther by Alexander Binder in 1925 As a young man Nils Asther moved to Stockholm, where he received acting lessons from Augusta Lindberg. It was through Lindberg that Asther received his first theatrical engagement at Lorensbergsteatern in Gothenburg, and in 1916 Mauritz Stiller cast him in The Wings (Swedish: Vingarne), a gay-themed Swedish silent film from 1916, directed by Mauritz Stiller, based on Herman Bang's 1902 novel Mika√´l. In Copenhagen, actor Aage Hertel (da) of the Royal Danish Theatre took Asther under his wing. This soon led to a number of film roles in Sweden, Denmark and Germany between 1918 and 1926. =Hollywood= In 1927, Asther left for Hollywood, where his first film was Topsy and Eva. By 1928 his good looks had made him into a leading man, playing opposite such stars as Pola Negri, Marion Davies and Joan Crawford. He grew a thin mustache which amplified his suave appearance. One of his most popular films was Our Dancing Daughters, starring Joan Crawford, Johnny Mack Brown, Anita Page, and Dorothy Sebastian. Asther was cast opposite Greta Garbo in Wild Orchids as the tempting Javanese Prince De Gace. With the arrival of sound in movies, Asther took diction and voice lessons to minimize his accent, and was generally cast in roles where an accent was not a problem, such as the Chinese General Yen in The Bitter Tea of General Yen. =Career decline= Between 1935 and 1940, Asther was forced to work in England after an alleged breach of contract led to a studio-based blacklist.Nils Asther page on \\"Golden Silents\\" Asther made six films there. He returned to Hollywood in 1940, and although he made another 19 films up until 1949, his career was never the same, and he appeared mostly in small supporting roles. In the early 1950s, Asther tried to restart his career in television, but managed only to secure roles in a few episodes of minor TV series. In 1958,Britannica.com ‚Äì Nils AstherNew York Times 16 October 1981 he returned to Sweden, almost destitute. There he managed to get an engagement with a local theater and had four film roles before finally giving up on acting in 1963 and devoting his time to painting. Homosexuality Asther was a homosexual in a time when it was a dangerous social stigma, both personally and professionally. He grew up in a deeply religious Lutheran home, believing homosexuality was a sin and society viewed homosexuality as a disease. In Sweden it was called \\"unnatural fornication\\". While sexual relations between adults of the same sex were legalized in 1944, the medical classification of homosexuality as a form of mental disorder continued until 1979. The theatrical community and the film industry in the 1920s accepted gay actors with little reservation, always provided they remained discreet about their sexual orientation and there was no public suggestion of impropriety.Anthony Slide, Silent topics, essays on undocumented areas of silent film, Scarecrow Press, 2005 Asther was closeted. He proposed marriage to Greta Garbo to hide the true nature of his sexual orientation. Asther and Garbo had known each other in Sweden, and finding themselves relatively new to a foreign land they spent a great deal of time together. They often visited a friend's ranch outside Hollywood where they could relax, ride horses, go climbing, or swim at Lake Arrowhead.Nils Asther: Narrens v√§g ‚Äì Ingen gudasaga, (Carlsson Bokf√∂rlag, 1988) \\"Sailor‚Äù was a favored term for Greta Garbo's male, gay/bisexual friends.

Asther mentions some of this in his memoirs. He had a long-term relationship with actor/stuntman and World War II Navy sailor Ken DuMain. According to Ken DuMain, he met Asther on Hollywood Boulevard in the early 1940s, and they enjoyed a long-term relationship. In August 1930, Nils entered a lavender marriage with Vivian Duncan, one of his Topsy and Eva co-stars.Bradley, Edwin M. The First Hollywood Musicals They had one child, Evelyn Asther Duncan, nicknamed in the media as \\"the international Baby\\" due to her Swedish father, American mother, and Bavarian birth. Their daughter's nationality was debated, and Asther offered to apply for American citizenship if it would help the process of getting their daughter into America. Right from the start, Asther and Duncan's marriage proved stormy and became fodder for the tabloids. They divorced in 1932. Memoirs Asther's memoir Narrens v√§g ‚Äì Ingen gudasaga (The Road of the Jester ‚Äì Not a God's Tale) was published posthumously in Swedish.Nils Asther page on Answers.com The book was put together with a foreword by theatre historian Uno ‚ÄùMyggan‚Äù Ericson, who had met Asther only once, when he arrived in Gothenburg in 1958. The afterword was written by Iwo Wiklander. The middle of the book, written by Asther, covers the years between his birth and his return to Sweden in 1958. Iwo Wiklander claimed in later interviews that Nils Asther was intent on destroying parts of his life before his death and much material in his autobiography was exaggerated or completely made up to make a more interesting story. Countess Linde Klinckowstr√∂m-von Rosen claimed their \\"engagement\\" was a practical joke while filming together. She did however, introduce Nils to her family and the Swedish painter Nils Dardel and his freethinking artistic circle.

Structure The iliac crest stretches posteriorly from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS). Behind the ASIS, it divides into an outer and inner lip separated by the intermediate zone. The outer lip bulges laterally into the iliac tubercle. Platzer (2004), p 186 Palpable in its entire length, the crest is convex superiorly but is sinuously curved, being concave inward in front, concave outward behind. Palastanga (2006), p 243 It is thinner at the center than at the extremities. =Development= The iliac crest is derived from endochondral bone.  Function To the external lip are attached the Tensor fasciae latae, Obliquus externus abdominis, and Latissimus dorsi, and along its whole length the fascia lata; to the intermediate line, the Obliquus internus abdominis.

The iliac crest is also considered the most ideal donor site for bone grafting when a large quantity of bone is needed. For example, oral and maxillofacial surgeons will often use iliac crest bone to fill in large osseous defects of the oral cavity caused by severe periodontal disease, excess bone resorption following tooth loss, trauma, or congenital defects including alveolar clefts.Rose, Louis F..

He served as the first branch chief of the newly formed Hurricane Specialist Unit (HSU) before his retirement in 2017. Education and Career Franklin graduated from the Ransom Everglades School in Miami, where he was a co-valedictorian in 1976 before going on to graduate with a Master of Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1984. Most of his career was dedicated to developing better ways to more accurately predict hurricane intensity. In an interview as branch chief, he stated that it is much easier to predict the trajectory of a hurricane than the intensity of a hurricane due to a \\"lack of understanding of how the physical processes work, lack of observations of the small-scale features that are controlling intensity, and to some extent the models are not advanced enough.\\" Moreover, in 2012 Franklin said ‚Äúpredicting storm intensity requires knowing lots of small-scale details that computer models have trouble capturing, from the dynamics of a storm‚Äôs structure to the characteristics of air masses being pulled into a storm‚Äôs circulation.‚Äù Beginning as a student at MIT and early on in his career, he helped develop a device, dropsonde, designed to be dropped from an aircraft to measure atmospheric conditions as it falls to earth. In 1982, the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command Hurricane Hunter's began using an Omega-based dropsonde to measure the atmospheric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and the direction of hurricanes. Installing GPS location equipment improved hurricane intensity forecast accuracy by directly measuring the eyewall characteristics. Franklin then contributed to the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF), hurricane forecasting software, developed by the Naval Research Laboratory which has been used by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) since 1987 and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) since 1990. His career with the NHC also contributed to developing 5-day forecasts, which became standard for hurricanes predicted to make landfall in the U.S. Additionally, 3-day accuracy of hurricane trajectory forecasting improved by reducing the prediction uncertainty from 518 miles in 1970 to 48 miles. Further advances in hurricane forecasting came with the Hurricane Forecasting Improvement Program (HFIP), with specific goals to reduce the average errors of hurricane track and intensity forecasts by 20% within five years and 50% in ten years with a forecast period out to 7 days. While the HFIP was on track to meet these objectives, particularly with the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model, a budget decrease threatened to impede the objectives of the program. Success of the HFIP can be partially attributed to the Doppler weather radar measurements taken from aircraft flying into hurricanes. Franklin accepted the science of meteorology, but recognized the limitations of the Saffir-Simpson scales in communicating the dangers of hurricanes. While overseeing the HSU, he tried to emphasize all the hazards of a hurricane, most importantly the storm surge. During Hurricane Sandy, the storm was predicted to weaken to a post-tropical cyclone before landfall on the Eastern U.S. coastline. Downgrading the hurricane could have minimized the public's storm preparation but was the best forecast given the evidence. Ultimately, retaining the status as a hurricane for public messaging ‚Äúwould have utterly destroyed the credibility of the agency in the long run,‚Äù Franklin said. Franklin also supported an approach to move the start date of the hurricane season from June 1 to an earlier date. A start date of June 1 would have only missed 3.1% of U.S. landfalls with wind speeds exceeding 39 mph between 1971 and 2018. Meanwhile, a start date of May 15 would have captured all but one out of 162 U.S. storms in the same timeframe. However, Franklin cautioned against moving the date even earlier to May 1, due to concerns over public safety and a lack of preparedness during the peak of the season. In 2007, Franklin, along with twenty-two other staff members, signed a letter to remove its current director, William Proenza, stating ‚ÄúThe effective functioning of the National Hurricane Center is at stake.‚Äù. The staff were critical of Proenza's unscientific claim over the impact of a weather satellite on forecasting performance.  Forecast Style  Franklin, much like his counterpart Lixion Avila, would add his own commentary to the forecast. Some examples are below. *In forecasting 2002 Atlantic hurricane season's Hurricane Kyle, Franklin noted \\"for fun, [a] long-range run of the GFS [model] has Kyle ‚Äî its decayed remnants actually ‚Äî reaching south Florida just in time for the kickoff of the Miami/Florida State game, one week from tomorrow.\\" Later, as the storm deteriorated, Franklin began his forecast discussion with a line from the Bee Gees' song Stayin' Alive. *When forecasting Tropical Storm Franklin in 2005, Franklin wrote \\"Franklin ‚Äî the storm, not the forecaster ‚Äî has become a little better organized overnight. [...] It is quite possible that little or nothing will be left of Franklin ‚Äî the storm, not the forecaster ‚Äî in 2‚Äì3 days.\\" *In the Tropical Cyclone Report for Hurricane Vince in 2005, Franklin alluded to My Fair Lady when he quipped \\"The rain in Spain was mainly less than 2 inches, although 3.30 inches fell in the plain at Cordoba.\\" *In a discussion for Tropical Depression Ana in 2009, Franklin noted that \\"[t]he intensity forecast is complicated by the uncertain existence of an actual tropical cyclone...\\"  Recognition  Franklin (middle) receiving the Isaac M.

Enrollment has grown to just over 16,000 students. The average student to teacher ratio is 15:1 In 2009, the school district was rated \\"recognized\\" by the Texas Education Agency. History In the 1890s, the town of Wylie had been served by a small schoolWylie City History with small funding primarily by the parents of the students of the schools. Thomas Franklin Birmingham noticed this problem traveling and established Wylie ISD in 1901-1902. He set limits of the district that all citizens in that area would pay taxes to uphold the district. The Birmingham family had provided money to build a proper High School. Since then the Birmingham family has established various Land TrustsWylie ISD.net to fund areas of curriculum for the district as well as scholarships for the top 22 of the graduating class. The city and district has honored him and his family with the Birmingham Elementary School and streets among other things. In 2007 the Wylie East High School opened for the 2007-2008 school year. In 2009, the school was rated \\"exemplary\\" by the Texas Education Agency. In the summer of 2015 all Wylie ISD campuses underwent renovations to bring them well in the 21st century. The most recent school to have been built was George W. Bush Elementary school, which opened the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year. Standardized dress Since the 2006-2007 school year, all Wylie ISD students in grades 5 through 12 have had to comply with a standardized dress code, which is similar to a school uniform.Dress Code In the 2007-2008 school year, the dress code went largely unchanged, except that hooded sweatshirts were not accepted. The dress code included wearing a tucked in solid polo shirt, turtle neck, or button up shirts. Bottoms were specified to be pants, shorts, or skirt, paired with a belt, in khaki, black, or navy blue. In 2011, the Wylie ISD school board officially changed its policy to allow hooded sweatshirts, pants with rivets, cargo pants, colored belts, and shoelaces. The dress code was changed again in 2017 to allow all hoodies, untucked shirts, and mock turtle necks.

He was also a theologian and historian and a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Biography =Early life and studies= Jean-Guenol√©-Marie Dani√©lou was born on 14 May 1905 in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He was the son of Charles Dani√©lou and Madeleine Clamorgan. His father was an anticlerical politician who served in the French government several times as a minister, while his mother was an educator and the founder of institutions for women's education. His brother Alain (1907-1994) was a noted Indologist and a renowned historian. Dani√©lou studied at La Sorbonne and passed his agr√©gation in grammar in 1927. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1929 and during his regency taught at a boys' school in Poitiers, from 1934 to 1936. He then studied theology at Fourvi√®re in Lyon under Henri de Lubac, who introduced him to patristics and the Fathers of the Church. He was ordained a priest on 20 August 1938. =Priesthood, episcopate and cardinalate= left During World War II, Dani√©lou served with the Air Force in 1939-1940\\\\. With the fall of France to Nazi Germany he was returned to civilian life and entered doctoral studies, completing in 1942 his thesis on the spiritual doctrine of St. Gregory of Nyssa. He was then appointed chaplain to the female section of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, at S√®vres. He spent most of his time on research in patristics, and became, with Henri de Lubac one of the founders of the Sources Chr√©tiennes collection. In 1944 he was named Professor of Early Christian History at the Institut Catholique de Paris, later becoming dean there. Beginning in the 1950s he produced several historical studies which included The Bible and the Liturgy, The Lord of History, and From Shadows to Reality that furnished background for the development of Covenantal Theology. Thoroughly grounded in the Fathers of the church, who worked from Scripture, Dani√©lou generally avoided the neo-Thomistic terminology and approach and used a more relational vocabulary, emphasizing our self-gift in response to God's gift in Jesus Christ, with the gradual unveiling of the Trinitarian life in history. Pope John XXIII appointed Dani√©lou a peritus for the Second Vatican Council. In 1969 Pope Paul VI made him a cardinal, with the episcopal titular see of Taormina, and Cardinal-Deacon of San Saba. Similar to his theology professor Henri de Lubac he twice refused the cardinalate but accepted on the insistence of Paul VI. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 9 November 1972, to succeed Cardinal Eug√®ne Tisserant. =Death and legacy= He died unexpectedly in 1974 in the home of a woman who was alleged to be a prostitute. The Society of Jesus, after an investigation, determined that Dani√©lou was bringing money to pay for the bail of the woman's husband. His brother defended him strongly, pointing out that he had always gone out of his way to serve those in most need.\\"Jean had always dedicated himself to disregarded people. For a certain period he had celebrated a Mass for homosexuals. He tried to help prisoners, criminals, troubled young people, prostitutes.‚Äù Alain Dani√©lou.https://www.firstthings.com/web- exclusives/2015/03/despising-jean-danielou Bibliography A number of his works on the early Church abridged for a popular audience remain in print.

The name can also refer to a copper‚Äìzinc alloy (a brass) used for brazing, or to pure zinc.  Etymology  In his etymology of the English language, 19th-century philologist Walter William Skeat speculated that the word pewter might have been derived from spelter.  Zinc‚Äìlead spelter  An inexpensive alloy that is easily cast and worked, spelter was used from the 1860s in the manufacture of candlesticks, clock cases, tableware, and light fixtures. In the early 20th century, sculptors such as Jacques Limousin used spelter heavily in their manufacture of Art Nouveau and Art Deco figurines and other ornaments. Spelter is relatively soft and brittle. It can be distinguished from bronze by scratching its patina: untarnished spelter is white, while bronze is yellow.

Although this is sometimes called a game genre, Christian games can follow the gameplay of many different genres. This ranges from Guitar Praise, a Christian-themed rhythm game, to the shooter game Catechumen. Some Christian-games with an evangelical purpose can be thought of as serious games, but most Christian games are simply entertainment for players who are already Christians. or historically interested in Christianity.  History  One of the first Christian video games was the ‚ÄúBible Computer Games‚Äù series published by BibleBytes (now a division of Kidware Software LLC) for the TRS-80 Color Computer in 1982. The ‚ÄúBible Computer Games‚Äù were then released on the Timex Sinclair and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A computer platforms in 1983. The Bible Computer Games Series was then released on the Apple IIe, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, and the Kaypro CP/M computer platforms in 1984. An MS-DOS version of the Bible Computer Games was released in 1986 by PC Enterprises. Several Christian themed computer programming books, based on the original BibleBytes \\"Bible Computer Games\\" source code, were also written by the Conrods. John & Joyce Conrod were the primary authors on the first two books while their son, Phil Conrod was one of the original game developers and served as technical editor. The first BASIC programming book, \\"Computer Bible Games\\", included the BASIC source code for the Timex/Sinclair, Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer, and Texas Instruments TI-99 computer systems. The first programming book was written in the Fall of 1983 and published by Ac'cent Books on January 1, 1984. These beginner computer programming books were designed to teach students how to write BASIC Bible Computer Games on their own personal computer. Since then, PC Enterprises and BibleByte Books has published several \\"Computer Bible Games\\" programming books for Microsoft Small Basic, Visual Basic, Visual C# and Java. All of these Bible themed programming books were designed for Christian Middle-School and High-School students in addition to Homeschool Computer Science students. Another Christian video game pioneer was Bernard K. Bangley, who wrote \\"Bible BASIC : Bible Games for Personal Computers\\" with his son, David Bangley. Bible BASIC was published by Harper & Row in December, 1983. His book included type-in BASIC programs to create Bible games. The programs were intended to work in any version of BASIC, but the book included tips for adapting the programs for the Apple II, Atari 400/800, Commodore VIC-20/64, and TRS-80, as well as extending and customising the programs to make them more interesting. Music Machine by Sparrow Records, for the Atari 2600, was the first Atari 2600 Christian videogame. However, it does not appear to have been a market success. Starting in the late 1980s, the unlicensed game developer Color Dreams using the name of Wisdom Tree, developed the first Christian video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, called Bible Adventures.Thompson, Justin, Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: First Look IGN, March 14, 2003, Retrieved on Feb 25 2008 It featured Bible accounts such as Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath. It was released in 1991 to Christian bookstores. In 2000 Catechumen was released, made by N'Lightning Software Development. Catechumen is a Roman- themed first-person shooter video game. It is known for being one of the most expensive Christian video games made. N'Lightning spent nearly $830,000 during the development process. The game had disappointing sales. Catechumen had a spiritual successor released in 2001, called Ominous Horizons: A Paladin's Calling, which eventually led to the company's disbandment. In 2006 Left Behind: Eternal Forces was released by Inspired Media Entertainment based on the evangelical Christian Left Behind series of novels. Left Behind: Eternal Forces was a real-time strategy game. Upon its release, Eternal Forces was subject to much criticism and controversy from various watchdog groups claiming that it promoted religious warfare and bigotry. Inspired Media Entertainment went on to create four sequel to Left Behind: Eternal Forces. In 2010 Inspired Media Entertainment merged with Digital Praise (creators of Dance Praise and several other Christian video games.) However, by the next year Inspired Media Entertainment went defunct, and in 2013, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission made public their pending lawsuit against Left Behind Games under the allegations that CEO Troy Lyndon issued nearly two billion unregistered shares.  Reception  In the 2000's, Christian video games were receiving much criticism for being lacking in innovation and gameplay mechanics because of focusing too heavily on getting their message across. Some Christian games were criticised for being \\"clones\\" of other, more popular games with Bible-related themes and characters simply re-skinned over the top.

The class is sometimes known as the Undine class, after the first submarine built. A further development was the British V-class submarine of 1942.  Design and development  These small submarines, of around 630 tons, were originally intended as unarmed training vessels to replace the ageing H class, to be used as practice targets in anti-submarine training exercises. The first three boats, HMS Undine, HMS Unity, and HMS Ursula were ordered in 1936, and during construction were modified to accommodate four internal and two external bow torpedo tubes. Apart from Undine and Unity, all boats were also equipped with a three-inch (76 mm) gun, although they lacked a hatch for the gun crew, who had instead to use the main conning tower hatch. As war loomed, twelve more vessels were ordered, although only four had the external tubes (HMS Unique, HMS Upholder, HMS Upright and HMS Utmost). The external tubes were dropped from later vessels because they generated a large bow wave and made depth keeping more difficult at periscope depth. They proved to be useful warships in the confined waters of the North Sea and particularly in the Mediterranean. A further 34 vessels, forming the third group, were ordered in 1940 and 1941. They were similar to the second group, but were lengthened by to provide a more streamlined shape. All but two of the 49 boats built were constructed by Vickers-Armstrong; the exceptions were HMS Umpire and HMS Una, both built at Chatham Dockyard. The submarines were powered by Paxman diesels generating 615 bhp (460 kW) and electric motors that could put out 825 shp (615 kW) giving a surface speed of 11.25 knots (21 km/h) and a submerged speed of 10 knots (19 km/h) .  Service history  Most of the boats built served with the 10th Submarine Flotilla based at Malta. 19 were lost during the war; 13 in the Mediterranean and the remainder in the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. In addition, one vessel, HMS Untamed sank in May 1943 but was salvaged and reconstructed to be recommissioned as HMS Vitality. From 1941, some of the boats were transferred to Soviet, Free French and other allied navies. The design was developed into the welded V class later in the war.  Group one boats  The initial three U-class boats all entered service in the latter half of 1938. Initially designed as training vessels, they were effective enough to persuade the Admiralty to expand the class, and also to improve their offensive capabilities to pose a more effective threat to enemy shipping. Of these initial three, only Ursula would survive the war. In addition, Ursula spent some time in service with an allied navy, in this case, the Soviet Navy, a practice that would be continued with other ships of the class.  Unity was the first British submarine to have a propeller designed for best submerged performance rather than surfaced performance.Brown DK Nelson to Vanguard p 112 It was thought this might reduce propeller noise.  Group two boats  The second group of the U class consisted of twelve submarines, of a similar design to the original three, but most were modified to improve depth keeping. This group included a number of submarines that would go on to become particularly famous. Urchin was transferred to the Polish Navy, where, as the ORP Sok√≥≈Ç, she sank 55,000 tons of enemy shipping. One of the most famous U-class submarines was , commanded for its entire career by Lieutenant-Commander Malcolm Wanklyn. Wanklyn received a Victoria Cross for attacking a well-defended convoy on 25 May 1941 and sinking the Italian liner . In her 16-month operational career in the Mediterranean, before she was sunk in April 1942, Upholder carried out 24 patrols and sank around 119,000 tons of Axis ships ‚Äì 3 U-boats, a destroyer, 15 transport ships with possibly a cruiser and another destroyer also sunk. Losses in this group were high, however. Only three out of the twelve survived the war.     Group three boats  These formed the largest group of U-class submarines, comprising 34 vessels ordered in three batches. Losses continued to be high. In June 1940 the decision was taken, in view of the anticipated high number of submarines to be ordered, to drop the practice of naming submarines, so these vessels were initially labelled P31 to P39, P41 to P49, etc., instead of receiving names. At the end of 1942 Churchill personally ordered that all submarines were to receive names,Obituary: Sea hero Captain Hedley Kett gave Hitler an ultimatum belfasttelegraph.co.uk, 30 July 2014, accessed 9 August 2018 '...received an order from...

One assigned to the Royal Norwegian Navy, HNoMS Uredd, was also lost after hitting a mine.

Derived from the Potez 62 airliner, the 650 was specifically built for paratrooper units. Development The Potez 62 was a high-wing twin-engine monoplane. The construction mode was not fully metallic, but used wood for the fuselage and a fabric-covered metal structure for the wings. Undercarriage was retracting, but there were no flaps, which the large wing area with thick airfoil made unnecessary, obviously at the expense of speed. Nevertheless, it was a major improvement over earlier airliners: the passengers for the first time in France enjoyed noise reduction and heating of the cabin. It was, by all accounts, considered trouble-free, safe and comfortable. The type however did not have a very long career, as it was quickly made obsolete by more modern and much faster airliners such as the Bloch MB.220 and the Dewoitine D.338. The Potez 650 only received relatively minor modifications: Hispano-Suiza 12X liquid-cooled inline engines instead of the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K radials, a less sophisticated cabin with accommodation for 14 paratroopers and their equipment (one squad) or 10 wounded (for the medevac role), and a larger door system for bulky loading (transport role). The first paradrop from a Potez 650 occurred on May 1937. Operational service The French military high-command did not have grandiose plans for paratroopers, which did not fit well with its essentially defensive doctrine of the pre- World War II era. Because of this, only two paratrooper companies were formed, and never reached full theoretical strength, and only 15 Potez 650s were manufactured. They were not sufficient in numbers even for such a small number of men, so the big Farman 224 airliner which had just been refused by Air France was pressed into military service. A combat mission was planned as part of the Allied entry in the Netherlands in the case of a German attack, but the plan was cancelled, and eventually no combat paradrops took place in 1939-1940. After the armistice, paratrooper units were officially disbanded, although training jumps were performed from time to time in North Africa. The Potez 650s were transferred to a military transport unit. When Free French and British forces attacked the French protectorates of Syria and Lebanon in mid-1941, the Vichy government established an airbridge to resupply its troops in the Middle East. Potez 650s took a significant share of the work, alongside converted bombers (Farman 223.3s) and airliners (Dewoitine 338s). Derivative: Potez 651 In late 1936, the Romanian Air Force expressed interest in acquiring foreign military aircraft. The Potez 650 was selected, but Romania required Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K engines to be fitted like originally on the Potez 62, since a license to manufacture these engines had already been acquired by Industria AeronauticƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ. Six examples of this new variant, designated Potez 651 were ordered in 1937, although it seems only four were operationally used. Originally ordered as bombers, the Romanian Potez 651s were relegated to transport duties during World War II. Three examples were still in service in May 1944.

As of the 2011 census, the population of the town was 4,580. According to the 2016 official estimate, Meghri's population is around 3,500. Meghri is located 376 km south of the capital Yerevan and 73 km south of the provincial capital Kapan. A nearby Russian military base houses around 2,000 soldiers, who along with Armenian soldiers guard the border with Iran. As a result of the community mergers in 2016, the municipality of Meghri was enlarged to include the surrounding villages of Agarak, Alvank, Aygedzor, Gudemnis, Karchevan, Kuris, Lehvaz, Lichk, Nrnadzor, Shvanidzor, Tashtun, Tkhkut, Vahravar, and Vardanidzor.’Ü’°’≠’°’ø’•’Ω’æ’∏÷Ç’¥ ’ß ’´÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂’°÷Å’∂’•’¨ ’∞’°’¥’°’µ’∂÷Ñ’∂’•÷Ä’´ ’≠’∏’∑’∏÷Ä’°÷Å’¥’°’∂ 14 ’∫’´’¨’∏’ø’°’µ’´’∂ ’Æ÷Ä’°’£’´÷Ä Etymology Meghri was founded as \\"Karchavan\\" in 906 by king Smbat I of Armenia, during the period of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. Later, it was known as Meghri, meaning \\"honey town\\" in the Armenian language. History =Ancient history and Middle Ages= The area of present-day Meghri has been settled since the Bronze Age. Many archaeological sites are found in the vicinity of the town dating back to the 7th and 6th centuries BC, during the period of Urartu kingdom. Historically, it has been part of Arevik canton of ancient Syunik province of the Kingdom of Armenia. The remains of Meghri Fortress of the 11th century With the establishment of Tatev monastery in the 8th century, the region of modern-day Meghri witnessed a rapid social and economic development. In 906, the settlement of Karchavan was founded by king Smbat I Bagratuni of the Bagratuni dynasty. In 987, the town (known as Meghri) was included within the newly-founded Armenian Kingdom of Syunik. In 1105, the region of Meghri was occupied by the Seljuks. The town was completely destroyed in 1126 and 1157 by the invading Seljuk forces. Between the 12th and 15th centuries, Syunik, along with the rest of the historic territories of Armenia, suffered from the Seljuk, Mongol, Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu invasions, respectively. =Foreign rule= At the beginning of the 16th century, Meghri became part of the Erivan Beglarbegi within the Safavid Persia. At the beginning of the 18th century, the region was involved in the liberation campaign of the Armenians of Syunik led by David Bek, against Safavid Persia and the invading Ottoman Turks. David Bek started his battles in 1722 with the help of thousands of local Armenian patriots who liberated Syunik. Surp Hovhannes Church of the 17th century In 1813, Meghri became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the Russo-Persian War of 1804‚Äì13 and the signing of the Treaty of Gulistan. It was included within the Karabakh province until 1868 when it became part of the newly-formed Zangezursky Uyezd of Elisabethpol Governorate. In 1810, young British army officer William Monteith visited the region as part of his service with the British embassy to Persia. His 1856 memoirs paint a vivid picture of the Meghri valley which he describes as a romantic glen that he rates as one of the most beautiful in Persia, or indeed in any country. He notes that in former times [it] has evidently been densely peopled for churches, abandoned but still perfect, are thickly scattered on the slopes of the mountains, which here rise to a height on the western side of 8000 to 10,000 feet, covered with forests. The trees are of no great size, and much interspersed with apple, pear, and walnut, probably the remains of former gardens, or produced by seeds carried by the birds and wind into the once cultivated land. He describes the settlement of Meghri itself as being divided into two sections, each about half a mile from the river Araz, and separated by \\"small enclosed gardens, surrounded by vines\\". At the time, Russians controlled the larger village on the north side; the Persians occupied Little Megeri. The Araz he describes as being here a rapid foaming torrent, fordable only in one place, about a mile and a half farther up the river. In 1881, the first mixed school was opened in Meghri. In 1901, a consumers' co-operative was opened in Meghri, which was the first of its type in Armenia. =Modern history= Surp Hovhannes Church overlooking Meghri With the establishment of the Republic of Armenia in 1918, Meghri was included within the Zangezur region of the newly-founded republic. However, after the fall of the republic in December 1920, the 2nd Pan-Zangezurian congress held in Tatev on 26 April 1921, announced the independence of the self-governing regions of Daralakyaz (Vayots Dzor), Zangezur -including Meghri-, and parts of Mountainous Artsakh, under the name of the Republic of Mountainous Armenia (Lernahaystani Hanrapetutyun). However, the self- proclaimed republic had a short life, when the Red Army conducted massive military operations in the region during June‚ÄìJuly 1921, attacking Syunik from the north and east. As a result of fierce battles, the Republic of Mountainous Armenia capitulated on 13 July 1921, following Soviet Russia's promises to keep the mountainous region of Syunik as part of Soviet Armenia. The Soviets established the Meghri raion in September 1930, and the settlement of Meghri became the centre of the newly-formed raion. In 1959, Meghri was given the status of an urban-type settlement. In 1984, Meghri was granted with the status of a town. It was developed as a centre of food industry based on the local agricultural products of the region. After the independence of Armenia, Meghri was included within the newly-formed Syunik Province, as per the administrative reforms of 1995. Geography Meghri at the slopes of Meghri mountain range At an average height of 610 meters above sea level, Meghri is located near the Armenia-Iran border, on the shores of Meghri River, dominated by Zangezur Mountains from the northeast, and Meghri range from the southwest. The town is mainly divided into 2 large neighborhoods: *Mets tagh meaning the large neighborhood, located on the left bank of Meghri river, it occupies the eastern part of Meghri. Formed during the 17th century, it occupies around 70% of the town's area. *Pokr tagh meaning the small neighborhood, located on the right bank of Meghri river, it occupies the western part of Meghri. It was formed during the Soviet days in the 20th century. The 2 neighborhoods are separated by the Meghri river and Adelyan Street. The surrounding areas of the town are designated as a Prime Butterfly Area,Butterfly Conservation Armenia http://www.butterfly-conservation-armenia.org/meghri.html having number of rare and endangered species of butterflies, such as Gegenes nostradamus, Papilio alexanor, Cupido argiades, Polyommatus damonides, and others. =Climate= The climate here is classified as BSk by the K√∂ppen-Geiger system. Demographics Holy Mother of God Church in Meghri, consecrated in 1673 Meghri is almost entirely populated by Armenians who belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Church of the Holy Mother of God of Meghri of the large neighborhood opened in 1673, is the main church of the town. It is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Syunik based in Goris. Here is the population timeline of Meghri since 1831: Culture The remains of Surp Sarkis church Meghri has a public library founded in 1882. The municipality also runs the cultural centre and the children's school of art. A branch of Yerevan fine arts teaching centre was opened in Meghri in 1985. The remains of Meghri Fortress dating back to the 11th century are found at the eastern heights of the town. In addition to the Holy Mother of God Church of 1673, the 17th century Surp Hovhannes church located in the small neighborhood is also active and famous for its wall paintings. The abandoned church of Surp Sarkis located at the north of Meghri, is also dating back to the 17the century. Transportation The abandoned railway station Meghri is the main gate between Armenia and Iran through the nearby Agarak border crossing. The M-2 road that connects the capital Yerevan with Iran, passes through Meghri. During the Soviet days, Meghri was connected with Yerevan by railway passing through the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. After the dissolution of Soviet Union and as a result of the military crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the railroad became abandoned. Economy The town's economy is based on food industry, which contains a bread-baking factory, canneries and small home-based wineries. Meghri used to have a large wine factory during the Soviet years. Agriculture is among the leading sectors in the region. Meghri is the only location in Armenia that produces pomegranate. The region is also known for its high-quality fig. Meghri has a significantly milder climate than the rest of the cities in Armenia, and produces fruits not found in other parts of the country. The Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline passes through Meghri. In early 2007, it was reported that the governments of Armenia, Russia, and Iran are planning to build an oil refinery for gasoline export to Iran. This US$1.7 billion project would be led by GazpromRefinery idea mooted whose Armenian subsidiary is already the country's main energy supplierGazprom Armenia buys the last section of Armenian pipeline that they hadn't previously owned though in 2016 a new agreement opened up the possibility of having Meghri area's domestic gas supply (around 5000 householdsDetails of the Sanergy project) to be provided by Iranian company Sanergy.Sanergy to provide Meghri's domestic gas network, under supervision of Gazprom Armenia The Meghri Dam (also known as the Meghri hydroelectric project or Aras Watershed Dam) is a hydroelectric system planned on the Aras River, also known as Araxes, near Meghri on the Armenia‚ÄìIran border. The construction was to have begun in 2012. The joint project was proposed and discussed earlier in the 1990s between Iranian and Armenian authorities.[construction_of_meghri_hpp_on_river_arax_will_start_in_2014_minister HPP station plans, 2014] In June 2016, the Meghri Medical Center was opened with the presence of then-president Serzh Sargsyan. Education As of 2017, Meghri is home to 2 public high schools. It also has a pre-school kindergarten ran by the municipality. In 2001, an intermediate technical college was opened in Meghri, preparing teachers, accountants and mechanists.

Star Wars references are deeply embedded in popular culture; references to the main characters and themes of Star Wars are casually made in many English-speaking countries with the assumption that others will understand the reference. Darth Vader has become an iconic villain, while characters such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Chewbacca have all become widely recognised characters around the world. Phrases such as \\"evil empire\\", \\"May the Force be with you\\", Jedi mind trick, and \\"I am your father\\" have become part of the popular lexicon. The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people. Many efforts produced in the science fiction genre (particularly in film) can now be seen to draw heavy influence and inspiration from the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as the magnitude of sequels, spin-offs, series, games, and texts that it spawned. Sounds, visuals, and even the iconic score of the films have become integral components in American society. The film helped launch the science fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science fiction films a blockbuster genre. This impact also made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including Spaceballs, Family Guys \\"Blue Harvest\\" special, Seth Green's \\"Robot Chicken: Star Wars\\", and Lucas's self-proclaimed favorite parody, Hardware Wars by Ernie Fosselius. Arts =Filmmaking history= Financial impact on Fox 20th Century Fox optioned Star Wars. When it unexpectedly became the decade's blockbuster, grossing $100 million in three months, Fox's stock soared from $6 to $25 per share and generated revenues of $1.2 million a day for the studio. Fox purchased the Aspen skiing and Pebble Beach golf corporations with the increased cash flow and still declared excess profits in 1977. Income from Star Wars re-releases, sequels, and merchandising enriched the studio in the following decades. Star Wars helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate. Impact on filmmaking Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before Star Wars, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s. Star Wars was also important in the movement towards the use of computer-generated imagery in films. The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. There was increased investment in special effects. Companies like Industrial Light & Magic and Digital Productions were created to provide them. The 1977 Star Wars pioneered the genre pastiche, where several classic film genres are combined in one film. In Star Wars, the genres were science fiction, the Western, the war film, and the quasi-mystical epic. Along with Jaws, Star Wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important. It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself. The holographic video effect associated with Star Wars served as a technological tool for CNN during its 2008 Election Night coverage. CNN reporter Jessica Yellin and musician will.i.am looked as though they were in the network's New York City studios talking face-to-face with hosts Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer, when in reality, they were in Chicago at Barack Obama's rally. The process involved Yellin and will.i.am standing in front of a blue screen in a special tent, while being shot by 35 HD cameras. Another impact Star Wars made on film making was its use of the \\"Monomyth\\" or \\"The Hero's Journey\\" found in Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. While George Lucas wrote through 4 drafts of the film, between the first and second drafts, he read Joseph Campbell's book titled The Hero with a Thousand Faces. He was surprised to find that his first draft followed many of its principles. This epic structure at the deepest roots of the films was a major factor in its success. Many future films successfully adopted the monomyth, such as The Matrix trilogy, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and The Hobbit trilogy to name a few. The Mandalorian In 2019, Star Wars web series The Mandalorian character The Child, also known as Baby Yoda, gained popularity with toys and an Internet meme. Lucasfilm-produced mockumentaries * Return of the Ewok (1982): a 24-minute fictional mockumentary, focusing on the decision of Warwick Davis to become an actor and act as Wicket the Ewok in Return of the Jedi. * R2-D2: Beneath the Dome (2002): a 20-minute mockumentary, focusing on the \\"true\\" story of R2-D2's life. It was made as a side-project by some of the crew of Attack of the Clones, released on television in three installments, and later on DVD. Parodies The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on modern American pop culture, both the films and characters have received official parodies in numerous films and television productions. Official animated parodies: * Robot Chicken has produced three television specials satirizing the Star Wars films (\\"Robot Chicken: Star Wars\\", \\"Episode II\\", and \\"III\\"). The success of the specials led to the development animated parody series Star Wars Detours. *Family Guy has also produced three tribute- spoofs Star Wars specials titled \\"Blue Harvest\\", \\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\\" and \\"It's a Trap!\\". Family Guy season premiere episode called \\"Blue Harvest\\", in dedication of the saga's 30th anniversary. A sequel to the episode as a parody to The Empire Strikes Back titled \\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\\" aired in the eighth season and another parody, \\"It's a Trap!\\", aired in the ninth season. *Phineas and Ferb parody of Star Wars (\\"Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars\\", also titled \\"Episode IVa: May the Ferb Be with You\\") aired in mid-2014, soon after Disney's acquisition of the franchise. *Rick and Morty parody of Star Wars (\\"Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri\\") is the tenth and final episode of the fourth season, aired on May 31, 2020. Unofficial film parodies: *Hardware Wars, a 13-minute 1978 spoof which Lucas has called his favorite Star Wars parody. *Spaceballs, a feature film by Mel Brooks which featured effects done by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic. Film references: *WarGames (1983), David Lightman hacks into the computer company called Protovision, A deep voice in a line says \\"Protovision, I have you now!\\", A reference of Darth Vader's line from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. *Kevin Smith's films such as Clerks heavily reference the films, in Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) decide to make a pornographic film called Star Whores to get them out of debt. * Trooper Clerks Fandom and fan films The Star Wars fandom is the community of fans of the Star Wars film series and other related media. The franchise has gained a notable presence on the internet thanks to the advance of social media platforms Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. On top of the many fan edits the franchise has inspired like Harmy's Despecialized Edition, there have been various memes related to specific moments in the movies themselves, like a mistranslated Chinese bootleg of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith and 'TR-8R' from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Conversely, the polarizing reception to Star Wars: The Last Jedi led to instances of review bombing on review aggregation websites. The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries. Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the Star Wars franchise in any way.

It was an exhibition of original production models, props, costumes, and characters from the first three Star Wars films. In October 2007, NASA launched a Space Shuttle carrying an original lightsaber into orbit. The prop handle had been used as Luke Skywalker's lightsaber in Return of the Jedi. After spending two weeks in orbit, it was brought back to Earth on November 7, 2007, to be returned to its owner, George Lucas. The first successfully launched space-rocket, to be sent by the private spaceflight company SpaceX, was named the Falcon 1. Elon Musk used the word \\"falcon\\" within the name of the space-rocket, as a reference to the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars. The Falcon 1's success led to the fabrication of updated versions of the space rocket, in what became known as the Falcon family of space-rockets. The Falcon 1 has since been retired, in favor of the Falcon 9. =Organisms named after Star Wars characters= Characters and other fictional elements from Star Wars have inspired several scientific names of organisms. Examples include: * Midichloria, a genus of bacteria named after the fictional micro-organisms midichlorians associated with the Force * Yoda purpurata, a species of hermaphroditic acorn worm * Agathidium vaderi a species of beetle * Aptostichus sarlacc, a trapdoor spider named for the sarlacc, the pit-dwelling creature on Tatooine. * Cambroraster falcatus, a fossil species of Radiodonta, named after Millennium Falcon * Han solo, a species of trilobite from China * Albunione yoda, an isopod * Darthvaderum, an oribatid mite genus * Polemistus chewbacca and Polemistus vaderi, species of wasps *Stormtropis, a genus of spiders named after the stormtroopers * Wockia chewbacca, a species of moth * Peckoltia greedoi, a catfish named after Greedo * Xenokeryx amidalae, an extinct hoofed mammal named after Queen Amidala * Ricinus vaderi, a species of chewing lice Politics and religion =Political impact= When Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a system of lasers and missiles meant to intercept incoming ICBMs, the plan was quickly labeled \\"Star Wars\\", implying that it was science fiction and linking it to Reagan's acting career. According to Frances FitzGerald, Reagan was annoyed by this, but Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle told colleagues that he \\"thought the name was not so bad.\\"; \\"'Why not?' he said. 'It's a good movie. Besides, the good guys won.'\\" This gained further resonance when Reagan described the Soviet Union as an \\"evil empire\\". In television commercials, public interest group critics of the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative program deridingly referred to the orbital missile defense project as \\"Star Wars\\". Lucasfilm originally sued to try to enjoin this usage of its trademark, and lost.Lucasfilm Ltd. v. High Frontier, 622 F.Supp. 931 (D.D.C. 1985) Explaining its decision, the court said, When Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election held on May 3, the Tories took out a newspaper ad that read \\"May The Fourth Be With You Maggie. Congratulations.\\"https://www.newsweek.com/star- wars-day-2019-may-fourth-be-you-margaret-thatcher-history-explained-1414528 On May 4, 1995 during a defence debate in the UK parliament, MP Harry Cohen related the Star Wars Day joke: \\"May the 4th be with you\\". Star Wars also made its mark in the 2001 census, when over 390,000 UK respondents entered their religion as Jedi. On March 1, 2013, President Barack Obama spoke on the sequestration debate. He said that some people expect him to do a \\"Jedi mind meld\\" on the Republicans who refuse to deal. In the 2014 Ukrainian presidential elections the Internet Party of Ukraine tried to nominate a man named Darth Vader; but his registration was refused because his real identity could not be verified. A man named Darth Vader was a candidate at the 25 May 2014 Kyiv mayoral election and the Odessa mayoral election of the same day for the same party. In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election the Internet Party let Darth Vader along other Star Wars characters such as Chewbacca, Padm√© Amidala, and Yoda run for seats in the Ukrainian parliament. In the election the party failed to clear the 5% election threshold (it got 0.36% of the votes) and also did not win a constituency seat and thus no parliamentary seats. In 2015, as a part of the decommunization process in Ukraine, a statue of a Vladimir Lenin was modified into a monument to Darth Vader at the territory of Pressmash plant in Odessa. In the 2020 Odessa local election a person called Darth Vader is again a candidate for mayor of Odessa (nominated by Darth Vader Bloc). In Odessa, 2 Zelensky, 5 Filimonov and Saakashvili will compete for the mayor's seat, Ukrayinska Pravda (30 September 2020) =Religion (Jediism)= There is a real religion based on Star Wars. Their followers follow a modified version of the Jedi Code, and they believe in the concept of The Force as an energy field of all living things, which \\"surrounds us... penetrates us\\" and \\"binds the galaxy together\\", as is depicted within Star Wars movies, although without the fictional elements such as telekinesis. Many citizens around the world answer list their religion as Jedi during their countries respective Census, among them Australia and New Zealand getting high percentages. A petition in Turkey to build a Jedi Temple within a University, also got international media attention. Other Between 2002 and 2004, museums in Japan, Singapore, Scotland and England showcased the Art of Star Wars, an exhibit describing the process of making the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2013, Star Wars became the first major motion picture translated into the Navajo language. Several organizations worldwide now teach lightsaber combat as a competitive sport, instructing on techniques interpreted from the films, and using life-size replica weapons composed of highly durable plastic that emit lights and sounds. Star Wars has been the subject of several parodies in the humorous magazine Mad, a publication that frequently publishes cartoon spoofs of Hollywood films. A parody called Star Roars was published in January 1978, featuring the magazine's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, wearing a Darth Vader helmet. In December 1978, an onstage Star Wars parody appeared in the form of a Broadway musical, The Force and I‚Äîthe Mad Star Wars Musical. The Star Wars prequels have generated a notably large interest in memes on Reddit. In the 2004 Honorverse novel The Shadow of Saganami, Talbot Sector Governor Estelle Matsuko, Baroness Medusa, states that she does not want the Manticoran Marines to start looking like Imperial stormtroopers to the local systems. Darth Vader appears in the 2016 game Clash Royale as the Dark Prince troop. The plot of a second-season episode of the CW television series Legends of Tomorrow (2017), entitled \\"Raiders of the Lost Art\\", centered on the impact of George Lucas's films on the titular heroes. In late 2019, Ichikawa Ebiz≈ç XI will supervise and play Kylo Ren in a kabuki adaptation of scenes from the sequel trilogy. During the 2012 Emerald City Comicon in Seattle, Washington, several prominent cartoon voice actors, consisting of Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell, John DiMaggio, Maurice LaMarche, Tara Strong and Kevin Conroy, performed a parody reading of A New Hope as a radio play in each of their signature voice roles; i.e. Paulsen and Harnell as Yakko and Wakko Warner from Animaniacs, Strong as Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls and Timmy Turner from The Fairly OddParents, LaMarche and DiMaggio as Kif Kroker and Bender from Futurama, and Conroy narrating as Batman.

A field line is a graphical visual aid for visualizing vector fields. It consists of a directed line which is tangent to the field vector at each point along its length. A diagram showing a representative set of neighboring field lines is a common way of depicting a vector field in scientific and mathematical literature; this is called a field line diagram. They are used to show electric fields, magnetic fields, and gravitational fields among many other types. In fluid mechanics field lines showing the velocity field of a fluid flow are called streamlines.  Definition and description  The figure at left shows the electric field lines of two equal positive charges. The figure at right shows the electric field lines of two equal charges of opposite sign. A vector field defines a direction and magnitude at each point in space. A field line for that vector field may be constructed by starting at a point and tracing a line through space that follows the direction of the vector field, by making the field line tangent to the field vector at each point. A field line is usually shown as a directed line segment, with an arrow indicating the direction of the vector field. For two-dimensional fields the field lines are plane curves, and most field line diagrams are of this type. Since at each point where it is nonzero and finite the vector field has a unique direction, field lines can never intersect, so there is exactly one field line passing through each point at which the vector field is nonzero and finite. Points where the field is zero or infinite have no field line through them, since direction cannot be defined there, but can be the endpoints of field lines. Since there are an infinite number of points, an infinite number of field lines can be drawn; but only a limited number can be shown on a field line diagram. Therefore which field lines are shown is a choice made by the person or computer program which draws the diagram, and a single vector field may be depicted by different sets of field lines. A field line diagram is necessarily an incomplete description of a vector field, since it gives no information about the field between the drawn field lines, and the choice of how many and which lines to show determines how much useful information the diagram gives. Field lines will have a start at the source of a vector field, where its divergence is positive. Field lines that go into the sink of a vector field, where divergence is negative, will there have their end. Field lines can also form closed loops, or extend to or from infinity, or continue forever without closing in on themselves. An individual field line shows the direction of the vector field but not the magnitude. In order to also depict the magnitude of the field, a selection of field lines can be drawn such that the density of field lines (number of field lines per unit perpendicular area) at any location is proportional to the magnitude of the vector field at that point. Areas in which neighboring field lines are converging (getting closer together) indicates that the field is getting stronger in that direction. In physics, drawings of field lines are mainly useful in cases where the sources and sinks, if any, have a physical meaning, as opposed to e.g. the case of a force field of a radial harmonic. For example, Gauss's law states that an electric field has sources at positive charges, sinks at negative charges, and neither elsewhere, so electric field lines start at positive charges and end at negative charges. A gravitational field has no sources, it has sinks at masses, and it has neither elsewhere, gravitational field lines come from infinity and end at masses. A magnetic field has no sources or sinks (Gauss's law for magnetism), so its field lines have no start or end: they can only form closed loops, extend to infinity in both directions, or continue indefinitely without ever crossing itself. Note that for this kind of drawing, where the field-line density is intended to be proportional to the field magnitude, it is important to represent all three dimensions. For example, consider the electric field arising from a single, isolated point charge. The electric field lines in this case are straight lines that emanate from the charge uniformly in all directions in three-dimensional space. This means that their density is proportional to 1/r^2, the correct result consistent with Coulomb's law for this case. However, if the electric field lines for this setup were just drawn on a two-dimensional plane, their two-dimensional density would be proportional to 1/r, an incorrect result for this situation.A. Wolf, S. J. Van Hook, E. R. Weeks, Electric field line diagrams don't work Am. J. Phys., Vol. 64, No. 6. (1996), pp. 714‚Äì724 DOI 10.1119/1.18237  Construction  Construction of a field line Given a vector field \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}) and a starting point \\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0} a field line can be constructed iteratively by finding the field vector at that point \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0}). The unit tangent vector at that point is: \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0})/\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0}). By moving a short distance ds along the field direction a new point on the line can be found :\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{1} = \\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0} + {\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0}) \\\\over \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0})}ds Then the field at that point \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{1}) is found and moving a further distance ds in that direction the next point \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{2}) of the field line is found. At each point \\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{i} the next point can be found by :\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{i+1} = \\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{i} + {\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{i}) \\\\over \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{i})}ds By repeating this and connecting the points, the field line can be extended as far as desired. This is only an approximation to the actual field line, since each straight segment isn't actually tangent to the field along its length, just at its starting point. But by using a small enough value for ds, taking a greater number of shorter steps, the field line can be approximated as closely as desired. The field line can be extended in the opposite direction from \\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{0} by taking each step in the opposite direction by using a negative step -ds.  Examples  Different ways to depict the field of a magnet. If the vector field describes a velocity field, then the field lines follow stream lines in the flow. Perhaps the most familiar example of a vector field described by field lines is the magnetic field, which is often depicted using field lines emanating from a magnet.  Divergence and curl  Field lines can be used to trace familiar quantities from vector calculus: *Divergence may be easily seen through field lines, assuming the lines are drawn such that the density of field lines is proportional to the magnitude of the field (see above). In this case, the divergence may be seen as the beginning and ending of field lines. If the vector field is the resultant of radial inverse-square law fields with respect to one or more sources then this corresponds to the fact that the divergence of such a field is zero outside the sources. In a solenoidal vector field (i.e., a vector field where the divergence is zero everywhere), the field lines neither begin nor end; they either form closed loops, or go off to infinity in both directions. If a vector field has positive divergence in some area, there will be field lines starting from points in that area. If a vector field has negative divergence in some area, there will be field lines ending at points in that area. *The Kelvin‚ÄìStokes theorem shows that field lines of a vector field with zero curl (i.e., a conservative vector field, e.g. a gravitational field or an electrostatic field) cannot be closed loops. In other words, curl is always present when a field line forms a closed loop. It may be present in other situations too, such as a helical shape of field lines. Physical significance When randomly dropped (as with the shaker here), iron filings arrange themselves so as to approximately depict some magnetic field lines. The magnetic field is created by a permanent magnet underneath the glass surface. While field lines are a \\"mere\\" mathematical construction, in some circumstances they take on physical significance. In fluid mechanics, the velocity field lines (streamlines) in steady flow represent the paths of particles of the fluid. In the context of plasma physics, electrons or ions that happen to be on the same field line interact strongly, while particles on different field lines in general do not interact. This is the same behavior that the particles of iron filings exhibit in a magnetic field. The iron filings in the photo appear to be aligning themselves with discrete field lines, but the situation is more complex. It is easy to visualize as a two-stage-process: first, the filings are spread evenly over the magnetic field but all aligned in the direction of the field. Then, based on the scale and ferromagnetic properties of the filings they damp the field to either side, creating the apparent spaces between the lines that we see. Of course the two stages described here happen concurrently until an equilibrium is achieved. Because the intrinsic magnetism of the filings modifies the field, the lines shown by the filings are only an approximation of the field lines of the original magnetic field. Magnetic fields are continuous, and do not have discrete lines.

The velodrome was initially developed for the South African Olympic Bid, this venue hosted the World Cycling Federation Championships in 1999. The project was completed in 9 months from inception. The Velodrome features an acoustically treated soffit lining for purposes of hosting music and other entertainment events. The Velodrome was designed as a phased development with seating capacity on completion of up to 6000 seats (existing seats currently are 2500 and Event Organiser can provide the balance to bring it up to 6000 seats) or standing capacity is 7800. Phase 1 is complete and various designs exist as well as development proposals for the surrounding property to support the functions of the Velodrome. The venue has served as Cape Town's main concert venue for the last ten years and has now been replaced by the Cape Town Stadium. Its maximum capacity for cycling competition would range from 5-8,000. On September 5, 2007, WWE's RAW SummerSlam Tour took place with over 7000 fans in attendance. The velodrome hosted the 2007 UCI \\"B\\" World Championship in June 2007. It was also the venue for the 2008 UCI Junior World Championships, which was awarded to the city of Cape Town. It was also the home of the Organised Chaos LAN Party, South Africa's biggest monthly gaming event. Organised Chaos moved to a different venue after the commencing of The Galleria Development early in 2012, but still make use of the Bellville Velodrome for large events from time to time. The Galleria Development At a Council meeting on 28 October 2009, approval was given for the City of Cape Town to award a R3 billion tender to establish retail, business, residential, hotel and conference facilities on an 11.5 ha property in the Bellville Velodrome precinct. The tender was won by Devmet Property Developments, a consortium of Devmark Property Group (Pty) Limited and Mettle Property Group (Pty) Limited, through a competitive bidding process that lasted more than two years. Mettle Property Group is 49% owned by Metropolitan Capital, an associated company of the Metropolitan Group, and is a level eight contributor in terms of Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE). The development is based on a spine ‚ÄòGalleria‚Äô that will provide the circulation and connection to all the facilities. Parking with entrances at various levels and locations will be provided to connect the hotel, conference and sporting facilities with the retail, business and residential components. Devmet Property Developments has put together a group of companies and management models that offer a suitable range of skills and experience in property development, property management, financial oversight, facilities management and events management. They incorporate and provide local and international experience, strategic partnerships and networks, and innovative technologies, designs and processes. The group includes Devmet, Big Concerts, the High Performance Sports Centre and several smaller, specialist firms,‚Äù Gelderbloem added. The overally capacity of the venue will be increased to 18,000 with the upgrade to the velodrome and adjoining athletics venue considered as part of Phase 1. It was initially envisaged that the development will be completed by 2014, however, as of November 2013, no construction work has taken place. There was some concern as to the developments effect on the surrounding suburbs as a road will need to be built through local suburbs and parks, but after public hearings the plan to build a road was withdrawn.

It is a bound volume of four supposedly historical records: Samseonggi, Dangun Segi, Bukbuyeogi and Taebaek Ilsa. According to its introduction, the text was compiled in 1911 by Gye Yeon-su (Í≥ÑÏó∞Ïàò, Ê°ÇÂª∂Â£Ω; ? ‚Äì 1920) and supervised by Yi Gi (Ïù¥Í∏∞, ÊùéÊ≤Ç; 1848 \\\\‚Äì1909). The entire set of texts, of which the only extant version is a modern transcription by Yi Yu-rip published in 1979, is widely regarded as a forgery among academics.  Contents  The four books comprising the Hwandan Gogi are: *Samseonggi (two volumes), describing ancient kingdoms called Hwan-guk that lasted for 3301 years, and Hwanung's 1565-year rule of Baedalguk. *Dangun Segi (Hangul: Îã®Íµ∞ÏÑ∏Í∏∞; Hanja: Ê™ÄÂêõ‰∏ñÁ¥Ä), chronicling the history of Gojoseon with 47 generations of Dangun rulers. *Bukbuyeogi, describing the six kings of Bukbuyeo (North Buyeo). *Taebaek Ilsa, describing the histories of Hwan-guk, Baedalguk, Samjoseon, Goguryeo, Balhae, and Goryeo; also includes the text of Cheonbu-gyeong. Dispute regarding authenticity =Support= Some historians view the Hwandan Gogi as worthy of further scholarly scrutiny, believing that it is at least partly based on historically valuable, ancient (if not literally accurate) texts. * The record that five stars were arranged in straight line at 1733 BCE (Ïò§ÏÑ±Ï∑®Î£®, ‰∫îÊòüËÅöÂ©Å). This astronomical record in Hwandan Gogi is proved by Professor Park Changbeom, and it is published in the journal.Î∞ïÏ∞ΩÎ≤î, ÎùºÎåÄÏùº, \\"Îã®Íµ∞Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏãúÎåÄ Ï≤úÎ¨∏ÌòÑÏÉÅÍ∏∞Î°ùÏùò Í≥ºÌïôÏ†Å Í≤ÄÏ¶ù (Scientific proof of astronomical record in Gojoseon), ÌïúÍµ≠ÏÉÅÍ≥†ÏÇ¨ÌïôÎ≥¥, vol 14 They show that the five stars were arranged in straight line at 1734 BCE with the assumption that Gojoseon was established at 2333 BCE. * Law Professor Junhwan Go asserts several reasons why the Hwandan Gogi is considerable.Hwandan Gogi explains why the Mausoleum of Dangun is in Kangdong near Pyongyang, North Korea - Í≥†Ï§ÄÌôò, \\"Îã®Íµ∞Ïã†ÌôîÏÑ§ÏùÄ ÏãùÎØºÏÇ¨ÌïôÏûêÎì§Ïùò ÏôúÍ≥°.ÎÜçÍ∞Ñ\\", (Í≤ΩÍ∏∞ÎåÄ Î≤ïÌïôÍ≥º ÍµêÏàò), Í∞úÏ≤úÏ†àÏóê ÎêòÏÉàÍ≤® Î≥¥Îäî 'Ïã§Ï¶ùÏ†Å' Îã®Íµ∞Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏÇ¨, Ïò§ÎßàÏù¥Îâ¥Ïä§, 2003-10-03 13:15 Ï°∞Ïù∏ÏÑ±(Í≤ΩÌù¨ÎåÄ ÏÇ¨ÌïôÍ≥º ÍµêÏàò).

The Daebaksan is located at current Pyongyang.Hwandan Gogi explained that the era name of Mun- wang of Balhae was Daeheung (ÎåÄÌù•, Â§ßËàà) before the era name of Mun-wang was discovered in the tombstone of Princess Jeonghyo (Ï†ïÌö®Í≥µÏ£ºÎ¨òÎπÑ, Ë≤ûÂ≠ùÂÖ¨‰∏ªÂ¢ìÁ¢ë) in 1980 - Retrieved from Empas Korean Information Ïó†ÌååÏä§ ÌïúÍµ≠Ìïô ÏßÄÏãùHwandan Gogi states that era name of Jangsu Taewang of Goguryeo was Geonheung (Í±¥Ìù•, Âª∫Ëàà).

In turn citing: Collins English Dictionary ‚Äì Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers 2003 It can also specifically refer to work arrangements for women in the workforce that facilitate motherhood, such as flexible hours, but at the same time usually provides fewer opportunities for career advancement. In turn citing: American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition. 2011 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. References to the mommy track often go along with being a housewife, \\"opting out\\" of the workforce, temporarily or even permanently. Women following the mommy track may be contrasted to career women who prioritize their careers more than having children. Origins of the term Writer Jennifer A. Kingson introduced the term \\"mommy track\\" in an August 8, 1988, article in The New York Times, in which she described the career hurdles faced by law firm associates who sacrificed advancement potential once they had children.https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/us/women-in-the-law-say-path-is- limited-by-mommy-track.html?pagewanted= Felice Schwartz's 1989 article in the Harvard Business Journal is sometimes called the first discussion of the mommy track phenomenon. Schwartz claims in the article that while \\"the cost of employing women in management is greater than the cost of employing men,\\"Schwartz, p. 65 this greater cost is due primarily to gendered expectations of the workplace and women's duties in raising children.Schwartz, p. 67 Schwartz wrote: Schwartz's assertions generated widespread publicity and a new conversation about women in the workplace. The New York Times, having coined the term in 1988, described mommy track in greater detail in a March 8, 1989 article, \\"Mommy Career Track Sets Off Furor\\" which discussed Schwartz's article and the response to it in the public sphere. The article described the mommy track as a phenomenon \\"in which women with family responsibilities are shunted into dead-end, lower-paying jobs.\\" Wage gap for mothers Across different pay levels and socioeconomic groups, women's earnings tend to plateau after giving birth.Wilde et al, p. 20 Even when controlling for variables, on average mothers in all groups earn lower wages than non- mothers.Wilde et al, p.6 Beyond this general drop in earnings, though, there are significant differences in mothers‚Äô wage gaps between high-earning women and low-earning women. =High-earning women= High-earning women appear to bear much higher costs of childbirth than low-earning women. In the US, choosing to have children will force a woman to give up 21 to 33 percent of her lifetime earnings, a loss that could cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.Wilde et al, p.26 Ten years after having children, a highly skilled woman with children remains at a pay level 24% lower than non-mothers even when time out of the workforce is taken into account.Wilde et al, p. 18 This group of women also seems to face greater discrimination within the workplace; only 16% of all law firm partners are women, a discrepancy absent from lower- skilled professions.Kornberg, p. 191 Higher-skilled women tend to have flatter wage-earning trajectories than their low-skilled counterparts after giving birth, primarily seen in a lack of wage growth.Kornberg, p. 200 =Low-earning women= Low-earning women who have children are sacrificing about 10 to 14 percent of their total lifetime earnings.Wilde et al, p. 26 Even ten years after having children, a mother in the US in this income bracket earns wages that are about 12% lower than non-mother, low-skilled women. This group of mothers tends to experience a one-time fall in pay immediately after childbirth of about 6%, but after that initial fall the wage gap between women with children and those without does not continue to grow over time. Part- time work and flexibility A theory frequently cited for why mothers earning lower wages than other women that is the fact that mothers tend to spend fewer hours in the workplace than non-mothers. A report in 2014 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working part-time. Part-time work and flextime or more flexible arrangements are seen as hallmarks of the mommy track, since they point to women not being in the workplace full-time. However, this is changing as more people‚Äîmen and women alike‚Äîchoose more flexible work arrangements that allow for more free time. Cultural pressures and influences In the years since the women's liberation movement and second- wave feminism, gender roles have become more complicated and less dogmatic.Blair-Loy, Mary. \\"Cultural Constructions of Family Schemas: The Case of Women Finance Executives.\\" Gender and Society. Sage Publications, Inc. 15.5 (Oct. 2001), p. 690 Despite this, the modern ideal of ‚Äúintensive parenting,‚Äù first described by Sharon Hays, ensures that mothers continue to take primary responsibility for raising children due to the engrained social norm that women are better nurturers.Hays, Sharon. The Cultural Conditions of Motherhood. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996, p. 129. Print. This is one of the reasons that while both men and women report having increased trouble with their work-life balance after having a baby, women are the only ones whose hours working decrease as a response to this conflict.Corcoran, Mary E. and Mary C. Noonan. \\"The Mommy Track and Partnership: Temporary Delay or Dead End?\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. The American Academy of Political and Social Science 596 (Nov. 2004), p. 137 Moreover, women who cannot afford to pay someone else to take care of domestic work are faced with the double burden of working outside of the home while continuing to complete the majority of domestic work in the home.Hochschild, Arlie, with Anne Machung. The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home. New York, NY: Viking, 1989. Print. p. 4 Another cultural influence on mothers' decreased presence in the workforce is gender discrimination within the U.S. tax code. Since domestic labor in one's own home is unpaid and untaxed, and women continue to do a majority of domestic labor as a result of societal norms, in many households it may be less expensive for a woman to take care of this labor than to go to work and pay someone else to cook, clean, and care for children.Kornberg, p. 193 The tax code also sees men as the primary earners and women as secondary earners, so men benefit from joint filing while women's earnings are frequently subject to higher taxation.Kornberg, p. 194 Married women in the workforce also pay payroll taxes, reducing their earnings, although they frequently receive the same benefits (Social Security and Medicare) as spouses even if they do not join the workforce.Kornberg, p. 195 Criticism Many feminists saw the idea of the mommy track as divisive to women and therefore one that could have a detrimental effect to the feminist cause. Since Schwartz's initial article proposed sorting women into two categories based on their devotion to careers,Schwartz, p.66 some saw this as a division between women that both forced them into narrow categories and ignored any existing differences between men. There is also an ongoing discussion of whether the wage gap that results from a mommy track is any sort of societal discrimination against women, or basically an effect of mothers choosing to spend more time away from work. In different countries =United States= In a 2005 study, in the US, it has been estimated that 31% of working mothers left the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child.Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Shiller, P. & Southwell,S (2005, March). The hidden brain drain: Off-ramps and on-ramps in women‚Äôs careers. Center for WorkLife. Policy/Harvard Business Review Research. Report, Product no. 9491. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation. As of 2015, the US was one of only three countries in the world (the other two being Papua New Guinea and Suriname) that does not have laws that require employers to provide paid maternity leave.https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-industrialized-nation- paid-maternity-leave/story?id=30852419 =Japan= Japan's social norms, like those of the U.S., help to cause many women to move into part-time work upon having children. However, unlike the U.S., Japanese mothers rarely return to full-time work after having children.Yu, p. 496 Even more so than other developed countries, Japan has an especially high proportion of women who work part-time, and a majority of those women are mothers.Yu, p. 494 Common business practices in Japan further penalize mothers who may have taken leave from the workplace at some point, due to companies choosing to only recruit directly from universities and setting upper limits on age for full-time positions.Yu, p. 501 =Netherlands= In the Netherlands women have entered the workforce relatively recently. Throughout much of the 20th century, women faced many legal and social obstacles preventing them from working. Although in the late 1950s, the Netherlands made important legal changes, such as removing the marriage bar and the marital power of the husband, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved ‚Äì prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family, reflecting the traditional structure of the society.https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045ae0ehttp://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/Gender/publication/Netherlands_2015_Review_BPFA_Report_of_the_Netherlands_Government.pdf Also, according to The Economist, \\"[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s\\", which meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist- explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12 In the early 1980s, the Commission of the European Communities report Women in the European Community found that \\"it is in the Netherlands (17.6%) and in Ireland (13.6%) that we see the smallest numbers of married women working and the least acceptance of this phenomenon by the general public\\". (pg 14).http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf From the 1980s onwards, the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but most of the women work part time. In 2012, 76.9% of employed women worked part-time, well above the European Union average of 32.1%.http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender- equality/files/epo_campaign/131205_country_profile_netherlands.pdf =The United Kingdom= The UK has less working mothers than many other Western countries.

According to the Nordic Information on Gender \\"The gender-segregated labour market is a main reason why women are more likely to work part time in the Nordic countries than elsewhere in Europe\\".http://www.nikk.no/en/news/gender-segregation-in- labour-market-leads-to-part-time-culture/ However, this part-time work culture does not extend to Finland, where for historical reasons there was a shortage of labour in the country, which increased the need for women to work full time ‚Äì as such, the part-time culture of the other Nordic countries was never established in Finland. Finland has a longer tradition of mothers working, compared to the other Nordic countries: in 1978, 73% of Finnish mothers of 0 ‚Äì 6 year olds were employed, compared to 69% of Swedish and only 48% of Norwegian.http://www.nikk.no/wp-content/uploads/NIKKpub_deltid1_temanord.pdf As of 2014, Sweden's employment rate for women was the highest in the EU28, and was only slightly below that of men (73% female rate vs. 76.5% male rate).

Forman's primary research focus has been the history of physics, in which he has helped pioneer the application of cultural history to scientific developments. Forman is especially known for two controversial historical theses. The first (often called \\"the Forman thesis\\") regards the influence of German culture on early interpretations of quantum mechanics; Forman argued that the culture of Weimar Germany, through its emphasis on acausality, individuality and visualizability (Anschaulichkeit), contributed to the acceptance and interpretation of quantum mechanics.Forman, Paul. \\"Weimar culture, causality, and quantum theory: adaptation by German physicists and mathematicians to a hostile environment,\\" Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences, Vol. 3, pp 1-115. 1971. Forman expanded on his original argument in: Forman, Paul. \\"Kausalit√§t, Anschaullichkeit, and Individualit√§t, or How Cultural Values Prescribed the Character and Lessons Ascribed to Quantum Mechanics,\\" in Society and Knowledge, eds. Nico Stehr and Volker Meja. Transaction Books, 1984: pp 333-347. Forman's second thesis regards the influence of military funding on the character and course of scientific research; he argued that during World War II and the Cold War, the massive scale of defense-related funding prompted a shift in physics from basic to applied research, spurring considerable historical research on the effects of the military funding of science.Forman, Paul. \\"Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960,\\" Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences, Vol. 18, Pt. 1, 1987, pp 149-229. Forman's recent work focuses on \\"characterization of the modern/postmodern transition in science, society, and culture.\\"See \\"The Primacy of Science in Modernity, of Technology in Postmodernity, and of Ideology in the History of Technology,\\" \\"History and Technology\\", Vol. 23, No. 1/2, pp. 1-152, March/June 2007 National Museum of American History: Paul Forman , accessed September 25, 2006 Forman thesis Forman (1971) argued the remarkable scientific achievements in quantum physics in Weimar Germany in the 1920s involved the cross-product of the hostile intellectual atmosphere whereby many scientists rejected Weimar Germany as an illegitimate state and in which there were intellectual revolts against causality, determinism and materialism. The scientists adjusted to the intellectual environment by dropping Newtonian causality from quantum mechanics, thereby opening up an entirely new and highly successful approach to physics. Forman links the emergence of quantum mechanics, and Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation in particular, to the postwar revolt against rationalist and causal-realist philosophies of science. Many intellectuals felt those philosophies somehow contributed to the crisis of European (more specifically German) national identity. Forman concludes that: :\\"If the physicist were to improve his public image he had first and foremost to dispense with causality, with rigorous determinism, that most universally abhorred feature of the physical world picture. And this, of course, turned out to be precisely what was required for the solution of those problems in atomic physics which were then at the focus of the physicist‚Äôs interest.\\"Cited in Christopher Norris, Quantum Theory and the Flight from Realism: Philosophical Responses to Quantum Mechanics (2000) p. 79.

It encompasses the extinct Tower Hill volcano and wetland and is in area. Established in 1892 as a national park, the land remained degraded until 1961, when it was declared a State Game Reserve and an extensive revegetation program was begun. It is now full of mature native vegetation and reintroduced native species, such as koalas, wallabies and possums.

(1990). The Geology of Tower Hill. Department of Industry, Victoria. . p.3. However, it was reported in 2020 that new evidence, which had come to light by using a more sophisticated method of dating than previously, known as radiometric dating, showed that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted at least 34,000 years ago; moreover, based on the axe head found in 1947, people were in the area before those eruptions. The local people were the Koroitgundidj, for whom the area was a valuable source of food. Their descendants still retain special links with this country. After European settlement, much of the vegetation was cleared, and the land used for farming and quarrying. Tower Hill became Victoria's first national park in 1892, but degradation of the landscape and native wildlife habitats continued until it was declared a State Game Reserve in 1961, when a major revegetation program began. The program used an 1855 painting by Austrian-born artist Eugene von Guerard as a guide for re-planting appropriate species. By 1981, about 25,000 trees and shrubs had been planted, along with herbs, grasses and rushes, and native animals were reintroduced. Populations of koalas, grey kangaroos, wallabies, echidnas, brushtail and ringtail possums, sugar gliders and over 160 species of bird were successfully established in the 1980s, and are still there today. Emus in the picnic area The Tower Hill Visitor Centre, completed in 1969 and opened in 1970, located in the central complex of volcanic cones, is an important public building designed by Melbourne architect Robin Boyd.

In November 2019, it was reported that visitors taking the tours had doubled in the previous three years.

The festival began in 2003 and was held for the one day of New Year's Eve until 2008 when it expanded to the three days of 29‚Äì31 December. History Rhythm and Vines was founded in 2003 by University of Otago friends Hamish Pinkham, Tom Gibson, and Andrew Witters. They wanted to hold an event for their university friends to celebrate the New Year in a safe and secure location where they would be entertained by New Zealand musicians. The festival has been held each year at Waiohika Estate, Witters' family home. The first festival had one performance stage, featured dub/reggae/funk band The Black Seeds and was attended by 1800 guests. In 2004 a second stage was added and 5,500 people attended with dub/drum and bass/reggae/roots band Salmonella Dub the headline act. The 2005 event featured roots/dub/reggae/jazz/soul band Fat Freddy's Drop. The 2006 festival had four stages, featured overseas artists such as Mylo and attracted a crowd of 15,000 people. In 2008, Rhythm and Vines expanded to a three-day event which allowed the organisers to contract bands that were not previously available. This was large factor in making the 2008‚Äì2009 festival line-up the strongest yet by far, with many renowned international acts on the bill. Accommodation for the festival is mostly provided by BW Summer Festival, a seven-day camping festival that features bands such as Flume, Kora, and State of Mind. 2010 saw Rhythm and Vines sell-out, hosting international acts such as N.E.R.D, Netsky, Chase & Status, Chromeo, Justice, Flying Lotus & Tinie Tempah along with New Zealand acts Shihad, The Naked and Famous and Dragon with a record breaking, capacity crowd of 25,000. In 2014 Rhythm and Vines introduced the Arcadia Afterburner concert stage, brought in from Glastonbury Festival. In 2017, Madeline Anello-Kitzmiller, from Portland, Oregon, was attending Rhythm and Vines; she was topless, having paid to have her breasts painted with glitter at a stall at the festival. While walking through the venue with a friend, a man came up behind her and groped one of her decorated breasts, then retreated to where he had been sitting. Anello-Kitzmiller and her friend retaliated by pouring a drink on the man and hitting him in the face four times. The incident, captured on video, went viral and made international news.

Woodburne in 1967 in a Late Miocene locality near Alice Springs, Northern Territory. It preceded the most recent species of thylacine by 4‚Äì6 million years, and was 5% bigger, was more robust and had a shorter, broader skull. Its size is estimated to be similar to that of a grey wolf; the head and body together were around 5 feet long, and its teeth were less adapted for shearing compared to those of the now-extinct thylacine. Taxonomy  Restoration The description of the species was published in 1967, the author Michael O. Woodburne distinguishing the new thylacine with the epithet potens for what he interpreted as a \\"powerful\\" predator. The evidence for the species emerged from geological and palaeontological research into the fossil fauna of the Alcoota site. Description  A larger species of Thylacinus, greater in size and weight than the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) and only exceeded by Thylacinus megiriani, the largest of the genus. The animal was similar to a dog in the form of its body and jaws, and probably able to kill prey such as wallabies and other herbivores larger than itself. More specimens were described by Adam Yates in 2014, also discovered at the Alcoota site, revealing greater variety within the species and revising the weight estimates to greater than 35 kilograms. This material was found in a newly excavated site, named as \\"Shattered Dreams\\", that was opened by a backhoe to allow the extraction of specimens. The new T. potens specimens were a left dentary and maxilla which included the previously unknown anterior section of the dentition. The teeth of the new material exhibited a more gracile form than that previously assigned to T. potens, displaying a closer resemblance to T. cynocephalus. An examination of tooth wear that suggests durophagy, probably bone-cracking behaviour, is interpreted as an evolutionary recent practice, to which the dentition was only partially suited, or a consequence of the ecological circumstances that created the mass assemblage of fossils at the same site. The modern thylacine was not recorded as cracking bones as part of its regular feeding habits, but known as a consumer of carrion, and the individual T. potens may have encountered a mass death during a period of drought in the sub-tropical Alcoota region. The revision of Thylacine potens by Yates in 2014 concluded that the characteristics were closest to those of the thylacine, the most derived characters of the thylacinid phylogeny.

They designed and constructed aircraft and engines from 1908 until 1936; during the French nationalization and rationalization of its aeronautical industry, Farman's assets were assigned to the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Constructions A√©ronautiques du Centre (SNCAC). In 1941 the Farman brothers reestablished the firm as the \\"Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Usines Farman\\" (SAUF), but only three years later it was absorbed by Sud-Ouest. Maurice's son, Marcel Farman, reestablished the SAUF in 1952, but his effort proved unsuccessful and the firm was dissolved in 1956. The Farman brothers designed and built more than 200 types of aircraft between 1908 and 1941. They also built cars until 1931Claude Rouxel, Laurent Friry & S√©bastien Faures.

Background  In 1907, Henry Farman bought his first aircraft from the Voisin; and soon he began to improve its design of the aircraft, as a result it was known as either Farman I or Voisin-Farman I. In 1908, after further modifications which included re- covering it with 'Continental' rubberized fabric and addition of side- curtains, the aircraft was re-designated Farman I-bis.Opdycke 1999, p. 264. Ailerons were fitted after Wilbur Wright's flying demonstration at Le Mans in August 1908. A second aircraft, to be called Farman II, was built by the Voisin brothers incorporating design refinements to Farman's specification. Voisin sold this aircraft to J.T.C.

She was capable of speeds of up to 125 km/h (67.5 knots) Boats During the 1920s, Farman Aviation briefly dabbled in building airboats (known generally by the French term \\"hydroglisseurs\\"). Farman's boat-building followed directly from its aircraft experience. During the First World War, Farman-built aircraft engines and propellers from Farman MF.7s were used to build airboats that were successfully used during the Mesopotamian Campaign fought by Britain and her colonial subjects against the forces of the Ottoman Empire in Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq). Following the success of these improvised airboats, Britain began ordering purpose-built airboats from Farman and Charles de Lambert's company for use on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Farman Aircraft began producing civilian airboats in the 1920s. Its first non-military airboat sailed in 1920, though its first civilian airboat for sale was Le Ricocheur (pictured at right), a closed-cabin prototype capable of carrying 12 passengers at speeds of up to . Farman marketed airboats for use as water taxis and as light cargo vessels or patrol boats for French colonial governments, particularly on the Mekong and Niger rivers. These later airboats were open-cabin, like the airboats of today, though they tended to be somewhat larger, had higher freeboards, and lacked a protective cage surrounding the propeller. Farman's airboats sold for 25,000 to 50,000 francs depending on the model, a price that proved too steep for potential buyers; the company pulled out of the boat business by the end of the 1920s.

Overview The three railways were: *The Barton and Immingham Light Railway, which primarily enabled workers to get to the dock from Hull. *The Humber Commercial Railway, the main artery for goods to and from the dock, and *The Grimsby District Light Railway, which connected the dock with Grimsby, its established neighbour to the south east. All three lines became part of the LNER in 1923 then part of the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The Barton and Immingham route closed in 1963. In 2016 the Humber Commercial Railway route remained the port's major artery, carrying imports towards Barnetby and beyond. By 2016 the GDLR survived, having been renamed the Grimsby Light Single. It was but a shadow of its former self. The line's purposes The GDLR's immediate purpose was to convey men and materials to the dock workings, with the primary permanent aim of enabling workers to travel between Grimsby and the dock to work. The secondary permanent aim was to enable materials and especially locomotives to transfer between the new engine shed at Immingham and the intensively railway-served port of Grimsby and the railway-promoted seaside resort of Cleethorpes. The GDLR became a railway with two lines - a conventional light railway used by ordinary trains and an electric tramway which ran parallel to the conventional line for a significant part of its route. This tramway was publicised by the Great Central as the Grimsby District Electric Railway and later by the LNER as the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway, by which name it became widely recognised, but legally, all three were one, as set out in a Light Railway Order of 15 January 1906. The two lines were not physically connected. Early uses The conventional line was completed in May 1906, connecting at its south eastern end to the Great Central's Great Coates branch and thereby to the Grimsby to Sheffield Victoria line and the wider world. It was initially single track. At its Immingham end it ended in a field near what would eventually become Immingham East Junction. Lady Henderson performed the ceremonial cutting of the first sod for the massive Immingham Dock undertaking near this spot on 12 July 1906, with the VIP party brought to the site in the GCR directors' saloon and lesser guests brought in open wagons, spruced up for the occasion. Both trains used the GDLR. Contractors building the dock used the conventional line for the next three years, mainly transporting materials, but also transporting workmen in a train of ex-Metropolitan Railway carriages, which became known locally as the \\"Navvy Mail\\". The Great Central decided to provide a public passenger service along the line and built single wooden platformed stations apart named Grimsby Pyewipe Road and Immingham Halt. The line and the stations were inspected by the Board of Trade on 3 January 1910 and services started the same day using a steam rail car. Part of Page 645 of April 1910 British public railway timetable, aka Bradshaw's Guide It was intended that part of the GDLR would be an electric, passenger-carrying tramway to transport highly peaked flows of workers between the dock and Grimsby, the nearest centre of population. The 1906 Light Railway Order permitted the construction of a line from a triangular junction with Great Grimsby Street Tramways at the confluence of Victoria Street and Freeport Wharf, over Corporation Bridge then along Corporation Road and across country to Immingham Dock. This permission did not imply any legal or managerial connection between the line and Grimsby Tramways, merely permission to build a physical connection and, by implication, permission to run trams over both concerns' metals by agreement. This would seem a triumph of optimism over sense, as Corporation Bridge was not strong enough to carry trams and there were no firm plans or money to replace it. When it was eventually replaced in 1928, with heavy government financial backing, the wind had left Grimsby Tramways' sails and they were converting to trolley bus and internal combustion engine services. Corporation Bridge was a bridge too far. Orders for the construction of the electric tramway were placed in 1909 and the line passed inspection in November 1911, though with the dock not yet completed there was no urgency to open the line. A trial service was run on 6 May 1912, followed by a \\"Big Bang\\" undertaken without ceremony on 15 May 1912 when: * the Humber Commercial railway was completed, connecting with the GDLR at Immingham East Junction, * the GDLR's electric tramway was opened between Immingham Town and Corporation Bridge, and * the service between Grimsby Pyewipe Road and Immingham Halt along the conventional GDLR line was withdrawn From this point readers are referred to the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway article for details of the tramway's development and decline. The line's evolution Electric cables running from the power station at Immingham Dock to feeders along the tramway were carried on distinctive masts along the seaward side of the GDLR's conventional line, lending it an unusual appearance. The masts vaguely resembled commonplace lineside telegraph masts, but their narrow A-shaped structure and heavier wire-bearing crosspieces were sufficiently different to catch the eye. The conventional GDLR line was doubled in 1914, only to be singled in 1917, the lifted tracks being sent abroad as a contribution to the war effort. The Great Central's final estimates in 1922 included provision for reinstating the second track, but the LNER never did so. Towards the end of the Second World War Grimsby Corporation bought substantial tracts of land between the GDLR and the Humber Bank for post-war industrial development. The Humber Bank Estate was fully allocated by 1948 and other sites were also taken up, such as Fisons at Immingham. To match this development British Railways started to redouble the conventional GDLR line in November 1948, completing the task on 17 September 1951. Several of the wholly new, greenfield site industries, like Immingham Dock years before, obtained rail connections, changing the character of the GDLR's conventional line from a plain, rural, inter-urban connection to one with sidings and varied goods trains. Over time five sidings were laid, three heading towards the Humber Bank and two inland. In 2015 all could still be traced online using aerial and satellite images, though all had closed to traffic. In 1984 one track towards the southern end of the line was lifted and the remainder followed towards the end of the 20th Century, meaning the GDLR's conventional track has twice been doubled and twice been singled. This industrial development had consequences for the GDLR's conventional line besides the upturn in rail traffic. The huge growth in road traffic - from near zero - by lorries and employees put pressure on the level crossings. This, together with the specific example of an accident on 7 April 1954 when a light engine collided with a van at Kiln Lane level crossing, resulted in the crossings adjacent to Kiln Lane and Great Coates tramcar halts having signalling and lifting barriers installed and the lineside electricity cables being buried. The signalling introduced on both the electric and the conventional line was two aspect - red and white. Speed limits - a blanket 25 mph by virtue of its status as a light railway - have often been reduced to 10 mph near crossings or because of poor track conditions. The 1953 East Coast floods disrupted the electric tramway, with the GDLR's conventional line proving invaluable to ferry men and materials to effect repairs. The line has found occasional use for passenger diversions and enthusiasts' specials such as the \\"Lincolnshire Poacher\\" on 24 October 1987. The Line is Still used today for diverted freight into Immingham, Looping Freight Trains, Light Movements for Driver Training, Track RUST Busting or engineering work trains.

Kiln Lane AOCL (Open Crossing) HAS A MALFUNCTION - THIS ROAD IS DANGEROUS THAT THIS CROSSING IS LOCATED IS VERY BUSY BY LORRY'S BE CAREFUL Relationship with the electric tramway On 1 July 1961 the electric tramway closed, thereby depriving the GDLR's conventional line of an occasional traffic - transporting major items, notably tramcars, to and from the tramway's Pyewipe car sheds for heavy maintenance or repair. This was always a challenge, as there never was any physical connection between the tramway and any other line, but a track at the shed was adjacent to the GDLR conventional line, so cars and other large items were craned over from one to the other. After the Second World War, when the expansion of industry on the Humber Bank was bringing unprecedented usage to both the conventional and electric lines, surplus tramcars were bought first from Newcastle Corporation then from Gateshead Tramways. The Newcastle cars were transshipped without mishap, but when the Gateshead cars were being lifted over in 1951 a crane toppled onto one, damaging it beyond repair before it turned a wheel in Lincolnshire. The death-throes of the electric line led to two recorded, public, suggestions being made that passenger services be run along the GDLR's conventional line. On 16 March 1955 The BTC Chairman, Sir Brian Robertson, visited and in a speech said that the Commission would consider running DMUs or, astonishingly, EMUs along the line if the tramway closed, but that this would only be feasible if a direct road between Grimsby and Immingham was not going to happen. The politicking reappeared on 29 December 1960 when British Railways announced that if their application to withdraw the tramway was refused they would run a DMU service on the GDLR conventional line, competing with Grimsby Council's bus service. The council subsequently withdrew its objection to closing the tramway. The modern position Neighbouring lines were resignalled over Christmas 2015 with the \\"Immingham Light Railway\\" shown on a map and in text as a live line with current signalboxes at Pyewipe Road and Great Coates No.1. Part 2 of the article confirms the line remains open, primarily as a diversionary route, so Immingham can remain accessible if the main Humber Commercial Railway route through Ulceby is closed or overloaded. This is both corroborated and confused by the authoritative \\"Trackwatch\\", which confirms the arrangements but refers to the line as \\"Grimsby Light Single\\".

History Christian Brothers Academy was founded in 1958, when a group of devoted laymen, including Doctor George A. Sheehan, realized the need for another Catholic high school in Monmouth County. With the approval of the bishop, they initiated a drive to raise funds for the purchase of a piece of property. The Brothers of the Christian Schools, under the leadership of their provincial, Brother Anthony John Halpin, agreed to staff the school and finance its construction. The former Whitney Greentree Stables, a farm, was purchased and one building was converted into what is now Henderson Hall. With six Brothers and 150 students, the school was opened in September, 1959; two years later the new school building was finished and ready for occupancy.

The community was named after the Carson family, who had a store and blacksmith shop nearby., David Ramsey, Missouri Place Names 1928-1945 Much of the original housing in Carsonville remains. The community was notable because the West End Narrow Gauge Railway from St. Louis to Florissant passed through it, coming up the north side of Natural Bridge Road, then making a wide swing across Carson Road, which is now Hanley Road, to head for Lake Ramona in what is now Berkeley. The railroad passed on the west edge of Thies Farm, which is still in operation. The line became the Florissant and City Limits-Ferguson streetcar lines and the portion of right-of-way in Carsonville, and an electric substation, still are visible. On Cranberry Lane to the west of Hanley, the right-of-way is in place, complete with electric poles and the concrete posts which lined the railroad right-of-way remain visible. Hanley Road north of Lake Ramona was the streetcar right-of-way all the way to Airport Road and several blocks beyond to the Wabash railroad. The junction with the Ferguson line at Suburban Avenue is no longer visible, but the electric substation there is still standing on the east side of Hanley, right up against the road. That substation was the subject of considerable coverage in the electric railway press when it was built. It was for a time an auto repair shop.

It serves as Penang's main indoor sports centre as well as the preferred venue within the city-state for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE). Originally named the Penang International Sports Arena (PISA), the complex initially consisted of an indoor arena and a swimming centre. Since its completion in 2000, PISA has hosted national and international sports events, including the 2000 Sukma Games, the 2001 Southeast Asian Games and the 2013 Women's World Open Squash Championship. Between 2011 and 2017, PISA underwent major renovation works conducted by SP Setia, a major Malaysian property developer. The refurbished indoor arena, renamed as the SPICE Arena, is now supplemented in its role as a MICE venue by the new RM284 million SPICE Convention & Exhibition Centre. In addition, the renovation project included the upgrading of the swimming centre, now known as the SPICE Aquatic Centre, which was completed in 2016.  History  The Penang International Sports Arena (PISA), along with its adjacent aquatics centre, was completed in 2000 in time for the Sukma Games, a biannual national-level multi-sports tournament. At the time, PISA served as the venue for basketball and swimming events. In the following year, PISA became the venue for the wushu and judo events of the 2001 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games). PISA was one of the three SEA Games venues within Penang, while the majority of the other sporting events were held in Kuala Lumpur. Another international sports event that was held within PISA is the 2013 Women's World Open Squash Championship, which included among its participants Nicol David, the Penang-born squash player (and world number 1 at that point). = Renovation = In 2011, a public-private partnership project was undertaken between the Penang Island Municipal Council (now Penang Island City Council) and SP Setia, a major Malaysian property firm, for the renovation and upgrading of PISA. SP Setia would bear most of the estimated RM300 million cost for the project, and would be given a 30-year concession to manage and maintain SPICE prior to its eventual handover to the Penang Island City Council. A total of RM22 million was spent on the renovation of PISA, which was subsequently renamed the SPICE Arena. Renovation works had to be carried out intermittently, as the venue remained open for MICE events. Meanwhile, the newly-refurbished SPICE Aquatic Centre was opened to the public in 2016. In 2017, the SPICE Convention & Exhibition Centre, which has an internal capacity of , was launched. Aside from these facilities, SPICE Canopy, the retail component of the project, was also completed in 2015. A four-star hotel situated adjacent to these facilities is currently under construction. The hotel is scheduled for completion by 2019.  Facilities  = SPICE Arena = Interior of the SPICE ArenaThe SPICE Arena, with an internal space of , can accommodate 10,000 guests in a terrace-style seating arrangement, or 180 exhibition booths. The arena's capacity is further boosted by the Concourse at Level 3, which can sit a further 250 booths. = SPICE Convention & Exhibition Centre = The new SPICE Convention & Exhibition Centre, which can accommodate up to 400 banquet tables or 8,000 theatre-style seats, complements the existing SPICE Arena in its role as a MICE venue. Its grand foyer adds to its capacity by another 150 round tables. It also has 13 function rooms of varying sizes. Notably, the GBI-certified SPICE Convention & Exhibition Centre is the world's first hybrid solar-powered convention centre, with electricity being generated from a solar farm on the SPICE Aquatic Centre. The building incorporates energy conservation practices as well, with 654 energy-efficient light bulbs illuminating its roof. Moreover, the building houses the largest urban spice farm in Malaysia, which is sited at its rooftop along with a playground for special needs children. = SPICE Aquatic Centre = SPICE Aquatic Centre, a community swimming centre which also serves as a venue for major indoor aquatic sports events.The upgraded SPICE Aquatic Centre, which was opened in 2016, contains a wide variety of sports amenities, including an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a diving pool and a water them park for children, as well as badminton courts and squash courts. The centre also comes with function rooms, a cafe, a sports clinic and a swimming school. The solar farm on the rooftop of the SPICE Aquatic Centre and the SPICE Canopy is the largest commercial solar photovoltaic farm in Penang, capable of generating up to 980MW hour of electricity in a single year. = SPICE Canopy = The SPICE Canopy is the retail component of the renovation project by SP Setia.

More than just an identity for Delek's own locations, Delek US fuel brands ‚Äì DK and ALON ‚Äì are supporting over 700 independent distributor and jobber sites across the Southwest. Renewables * There is increased demand projected for biodiesel, and Delek's three biodiesel plants serve as strong assets in a growing renewable industry. * Delek's plants are capable of producing approximately 40 million gallons of biodiesel a year. * Located in Cleburne, Texas, Crossett, Arkansas, and New Albany, Mississippi. ** Delek Renewables utilizes a wide variety of waste stream feedstocks in used cooking oil, poultry fat, beef tallow, and choice white grease (hog fat) as well as vegetable oils such as soybean and canola oil. History Since Delek‚Äôs inception in 2001, its strategic vision has been to merge the acquisition savvy of a private equity firm with the management and operational expertise of seasoned energy industry veterans. The result is a company that has become one of the more active acquirers of downstream energy assets. Delek's success, however, has not been solely the result of an opportunistic acquisition strategy. The Company's growth has hinged greatly on the ability of management to consistently enhance the efficiency and profitability of purchased assets. Since 2001, the Company has completed multiple acquisitions in the refining, marketing/logistics, and convenience store industries. The merging of assets from across the downstream energy supply chain has positioned DK to benefit from a diversified revenue base. Today, Delek is a diversified downstream energy company with assets in petroleum refining, logistics, asphalt, renewable fuels, and convenience store retailing. Key events in its history are summarized below: Acquisitions/Divestitures * May 2001: Acquired MAPCO Express, Inc., with 198 retail fuel and convenience stores * April 2005: Acquired the Tyler Refinery and its related assets * July 2006: Acquired of 40 Retail Fuel and Convenience Stores From Fast Petroleum * August 2006: Acquired of Refining Equipment, Pipelines, Storage Tanks and Terminals From Pride Companies * October 2011: Acquired sole ownership of Lion Oil Company, with a refinery, pipeline and other refining, product terminal, and crude oil pipeline assets in and around El Dorado, Arkansas, and product terminals in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee * January 2013: Announced Agreement to Purchase a Biodiesel Facility in Cleburne,Texas from EQM Technologies & Energy, Inc. * February 2014: Announced Agreement to Purchase a Biodiesel Facility in Crossett, Arkansas * November 2016: Completed Sale of MAPCO Retail Related Assets for $535 million * November 2018: Announced Big Spring Crude Oil Gathering System in the Permian Basin * May 2019: Acquired 33% Interest in Red River pipeline joint venture * August 2019: Acquired 15% Interest in Wink to Webster Pipeline LLC * November 2019: Announced Agreement to Purchase a Biodiesel Facility in New Albany, Mississippi * May 2020: Sold Bakersfield Refinery to Global Clean Energy Holdings Mergers * May 2015: Acquired 33.7 million shares of common stock of Alon USA Energy, Inc.

NDBC designs, develops, operates, and maintains a network of data collecting buoys and coastal stations. The NBDC is located in southern Mississippi as a tenant at the John C. Stennis Space Center, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) facility.  Operations  NDBC employs engineers, meteorologists, oceanographers, computer scientists, and other professionals. NDBC provides hourly observations from a network of about 90 buoys and 60 Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations to help meet these needs. All stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; atmospheric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure sea surface temperature and wave height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations. A new task is the operation of the DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) buoys. DART is a fleet of tsunami detecting buoys. Another task adopted in 2005 is TAO (Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project) buoys. TAO is a fleet of over 50 buoys moored in the Pacific Ocean. These buoys are designed to help detect and predict El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a. All buoys and many C-MAN stations located in offshore areas operate on marine batteries which are charged by solar cells. Sensors are calibrated in wind tunnels or environmental chambers, and later tested with the onboard station microprocessors, called payloads, on test stands at the outside sensor test facility. Final calibration and testing of the completed buoy systems are accomplished in the onsite canal. All buoys are serviced about every two years for routine maintenance and to install newly calibrated sensors. A typical deep-sea NDBC discus buoy in the Gulf of Mexico The observations from moored buoys and C-MAN stations are transmitted hourly through NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) to a ground receiving facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, operated by the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). Additionally, some buoys and C-MAN stations may use the Iridium satellite system to transmit data. The data is recorded and processed by the National Oceanographic Data Center. Through a Memorandum of Agreement, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) remains a critically important partner to NDBC, supplying transportation for buoy deployments, retrievals, and other maintenance.  History  The National Data Buoy Development Program (NDBDP), created in 1967, was placed under the control of the USCG. In 1970, NOAA was formed and the NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) was created within the National Ocean Service (NOS) and located in Mississippi. In 1982, the NDBO was renamed NDBC and was placed under NOAA's NWS. The first buoys deployed by NDBC were the large 12-m discus hulls constructed of steel. These were generally deployed in deep water off the U.S. East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. By 1979, 16 stations were deployed in the Pacific, 7 in the Atlantic, and 3 in the Gulf of Mexico. Eight more stations were deployed in the Great Lakes after 1979. In 1995, development of the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system began, with deployment beginning in 2000. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis, additional dart buoys were deployed.  Location  NDBC's main office is located in southern Mississippi at the John C. Stennis Space Center, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) facility. This site was chosen because it contains an excellent pre-existing industrial facility which is adjacent to a canal with deep-water access to the Gulf of Mexico. Other offices are located in Sterling, Virginia.  See also  *Effects of global warming  References  *Text in this article was almost entirely taken from the NDBC website.

History The university's founding college, the Pennsylvania College of Optometry (PCO), which was founded as the Pennsylvania State College of Optometry (PSCO) in 1919, is one of the oldest optometry colleges in North America. The decision to establish the college was reached at an annual conference of the Pennsylvania Optical Society in 1918. PCO was the first school in the U.S. to confer the legislature-approved Doctor of Optometry (OD) degree after its four-year educational program. In 1975, PCO was the first college of optometry to develop a comprehensive, off-campus externship program. Later that year, the college began construction on its main clinical facility, The Eye Institute (TEI), which opened in 1978 to serve as a training site for the school's optometry students and as a community vision care center for the public. At the time of its opening, this was the first interdisciplinary clinical facility at an optometry school centered around patient care with graduate students. Presently, TEI has two locations with the main clinical facility in West Oak Lane and a satellite location in Chestnut Hill. In 2000, PCO became the first school of optometry in the county to offer a Doctor of Audiology (AuD) degree when it received approval by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. By 2003, PCO had created a distance education program for licensed and practicing audiologists called AuD online and was finalizing construction of a new building to be used by students enrolled in the AuD curriculum by their commencement. The Pennsylvania Ear Institute (PEI), the clinical facility of the program, was opened on November 19, 2004, shortly before the school's first class of AuD students would begin their four-year curriculum. As of 2017, Salus alumni comprise more than 23 percent of all audiologists in the U.S. The change in name from PCO to Salus University occurred on July 1, 2008. The name Salus, a Latin word for health and well- being, was unanimously chosen by the university board of trustees as \\"an expression of the institution's dedication to the preservation of the health and well-being of the communities its graduates serve.\\" At this time, the university's College of Audiology was also renamed to the George S. Osborne College of Audiology (OCA) in the memory of Dr. Osborne who was a key individual in the development of the AuD degree program as well as dean of OCA. Over the years, the university has added programs such as Physician Assistant Studies (PA), Occupational Therapy (OT), Biomedicine and Speech- Language Pathology (SLP). In 2015, the Speech-Language Institute (SLI) opened as the clinical facility for the university's SLP program. The university currently consists of three colleges: Pennsylvania College of Optometry; Osborne College of Audiology; and the College of Health Sciences, Education and Rehabilitation.

The commercial harvest is performed during a very short season, and the catch is shipped worldwide. Large numbers of king crab are also caught in Russian and international waters. In 1980, at the peak of the king crab industry, Alaskan fisheries produced up to of crab. However, by 1983, the total size of the catch had dropped by up to 90% in some places.Commercial Fisheries from Alaska Department of Fish and Game Several theories for the precipitous drop in the crab population have been proposed, including overfishing, warmer waters, and increased fish predation. As a result, the current season is very short and in the 2010 season, only of red king crab were landed. Alaskan crab fishing is very dangerous, and the fatality rate among the fishermen is about 80 times the fatality rate of the average worker. It is suggested that, on average, one crab fisherman dies weekly during the seasons.Christie, Les: America‚Äôs most dangerous jobs, Retrieved on April 28, 2007  Types of commercially valuable king crab  In Alaska, three species of king crab are caught commercially: the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus, found in Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, and the Kodiak Archipelago), blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus, St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands), and golden king crab (Lithodes aequispinus, Aleutian Islands). The red king crab is the most prized of the three for its meat. A fourth variety, the scarlet king crab (Lithodes couesi), is too small and rare to be commercially viable, though its meat is considered sweet and tasty. Specific size requirements must be met; only certain types of king crab are legal at different times of the year and only males can be kept.  Fishing season  The most popular crab-fishing time occurs between October and January. The allocated time for a season continued to shrink ‚Äì at one point a red crab season was only four days long. After 2005, each boat was given a quota based on their catch from previous years and how many crabs are available to catch. The fleet went from 251 boats down to 89. Currently, the seasons last from two to four weeks. Rationalization: derby vs. quota After the 2005 season, the Alaskan crab industry transitioned from a derby- style season to a quota system. This transition is known as rationalization. Under the old derby style, a large number of crews competed with each other to catch crab during a restrictive time window. Under the new individual fishing quota (IFQ) system, established owners have been given quotas, which they can fill at a more relaxed pace. In theory, it is intended to be safer, which was the main rationale for the change in the fishing rules. The transition to the quota system was also expected to increase the value of crab, by limiting the market of available crab. An influx of foreign crab negated some of these gains during the 2006 season. The rationalization process put many crews out of work, as the owners of many small boats found their assigned quotas too small to meet operating expenses; during the first season run under the IFQ system, the fleet shrank from over 250 boats to around 89 mostly larger boats with high quotas.  Equipment and process  Commercial fishing boats are between in length, are equipped with hydraulic systems to lift the catch, and are able to withstand the freezing weather of the Bering Sea. Each fishing boat sets its own sailing schedule during the crabbing season, often staying out for days or weeks at a time. Fishermen use a box-shaped trap called a pot, which consists of a steel frame covered with a nylon mesh. Each pot weighs and a ship may carry 150 to 300 pots. Fish, usually herring or codfish, are placed inside as bait, and then the pot is sunk to the sea floor where the king crabs reside. The pots are dropped in a straight line (known as a \\"string\\") for easier retrieval. Red and blue king crabs can be found between the intertidal zone and a depth of . Golden king crabs live in depths between 100 and 400 fathoms (180‚Äì720 m, 600‚Äì2400 ft). The location of the pot is marked on the surface by a buoy, which is later used for retrieval. After allowing the pots to rest on the sea floor (typically one to two days for red and blue king crabs, longer for golden king crabs), the pots are dragged back to the surface using a hydraulic winch with a pulley on the end called a \\"block\\". The pot is then brought on board the boat and the crew sorts the king crab. Any crab not meeting the regulation requirements are thrown back. The crabs are stored live in a holding tank until the boat reaches shore, where they are sold. If the weather becomes too cold, the live crabs may freeze and burst. If they are left in the tank for too long, they can harm and possibly kill each other as they can be cannibalistic. Even the rocking of the boat can cause damage to the crab, so boards are inserted in the holds to prevent excessive side-to- side movement. If a crab dies in the hold for any reason, it releases toxins that can kill other crabs. If the crew fails to remove the dead crabs, they can poison the entire tank and ruin the catch. Deckhands are paid a percentage of the profits after the owner's share is taken into account. This can range from nothing to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the size of the harvest. The so-called \\"greenhorns\\" (deckhands in their first season of fishing) are paid a fixed sum of money. Danger Statistically, Alaskan crab fishing remains the most dangerous job in the United States. In 2006, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked commercial fishing as the occupation with the highest fatality rate, with 141.7 per 100,000, almost 75% higher than the rate for pilots, flight engineers, and loggers, the next-most hazardous occupations. Alaskan crab fishing, though, is specifically even more dangerous, with over 300 fatalities per 100,000. Over 80% of these deaths are caused by drowning or hypothermia. The fishermen are also susceptible to crippling injuries caused by working with heavy machinery and gear. Population decline In 1980, at the peak of the king crab industry, Alaskan fisheries produced 200 million lb of crab, but by 1983, the total size of the catch had dropped to less than 10% of this size. Several theories for the precipitous drop in the crab population have been proposed, including overfishing, warmer waters, and increased fish predation. The slow harvest forced many fishermen to diversify and catch snow crabs (such as opilio and tanner crab) or cod. Since then, strict regulations have been enforced to responsibly manage the populations and allow them to rebound. The red and blue king crab populations have stayed relatively low in almost all areas except Southeast Alaska since 1983, forcing many fishermen to concentrate on the golden king crab. Foreign fisheries King crabs caught outside the United States are currently on the list of seafood that sustainability-minded consumers should avoid; the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program lists king crab caught in the United States as a \\"good alternative\\". The influx of crab from Russian fisheries has also created economic problems for U.S. crabbers. The amount of crab imported from Russia has increased from around 21 million pounds (9.5 million kg) in 2004 to 37.5 million pounds (17 million kg) in 2005 to more than 56 million pounds (25.45 million kg) in 2007. Much of this foreign crab is reportedly caught and imported illegally and has led to a steady decline in the price of crab from $3.55 per pound in 2003 to $3.21 in 2004, $2.74 in 2005 and $2.30 in 2007 for Aleutian golden king crab, and $5.15 per pound in 2003 to $4.70 in 2004 to $4.52 in 2005 and $4.24 in 2007 for Bristol Bay red king crab.  In the media  Deadliest Catch is a reality series aired by the Discovery Channel beginning in 2005. The show highlights interpersonal relationships and the dangers of king crab fishing: freezing temperatures, turbulent seas, the pots that must be dragged up can weigh well over a ton when full, and since the season is short ‚Äì both because of regulations and the weather ‚Äì fishermen often spend days at a time in very rough seas working long hours with little sleep.

In December 2018, following the election of Aitor Elizegi as the president of Athletic Bilbao, he was installed as the club's new sporting director, working with Andoni Ayarza and replacing the long-serving Jos√© Mar√≠a Amorrortu. Personal life Alkorta's younger brother, √ìscar, was also a footballer who was a midfielder. A fellow Athletic Bilbao youth graduate (alongside Jos√© F√©lix Guerrero who also had a more famous sibling in the first team), the younger Alkorta never made it past the reserves and played out his career in Segunda Divisi√≥n B; the brothers were on the staff at Athletic together for a few months in 1997, between Rafael's return from Madrid and √ìscar's move to CD Aurrer√° de Vitoria. √ìscar later worked as a youth coach at Athletic Bilbao, working under his older sibling from 2019.

Beazer, 440 U.S. 568 (1979), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in which the constitutionality of an employer's refusal to hire methadone users was upheld. Background The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) adopted a rule prohibiting the employment of anyone who used narcotic drugs. This rule was applied to persons using methadone, a drug used to treat heroin addiction. Two former NYCTA employees who had been fired while receiving methadone treatment and two applicants who were denied employment because of their use and past use of methadone sued the TA in federal district court. The court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and found the policy unconstitutional. While the district court enjoined the NYCTA from denying employment solely on the basis of past or current participation in a methadone maintenance program, it did authorize the transit authority to exclude methadone users from certain safety-related positions, as well as to condition employment on satisfactory performance in a methadone program for at least one year. This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Issues presented The Court was confronted with the question of whether a government could choose not to employ, as an entire class, users of narcotic drugs. Decision The Court, in an opinion delivered by Justice Stevens, reversed the decision of the lower courts and found that the NYC Transit Authority had a rational basis for its classification of narcotics users and the extension of this rule to cover methadone users. =Dissent= Justices Brennan and White wrote separate dissents. Justice Brennan dissented on the grounds that the Title VII claim had been proven. Justice White, joined by Justice Marshall, argued that the classification of persons successfully participating in a methadone program as dispositively different from the generally population was without justification. They believed that this classification violated the equal protection clause as irrational and invidious.

He was the author of Wooden Ships and Iron Men, a now-classic 1924 book about the last days of the Age of Sail in Maritime Canada. Born in Glasgow, Scotland, he initially worked as a clerk but turned to the sea as a journalist of the fishing industry which later led to historical work. Wallace served in World War I as commander of a Q-Ship. He died in Montreal on July 15, 1958. About forty years later than he preferred to, he said, he published Wooden Ships and Iron Men as a testament to the spirit of the Age of Sail. He followed this book with In the Wake of the Windships and Record of Canadian Shipping. These three historical works became standard references to the deepwater sailing era in Canada. Wallace also wrote the novels Blue Water and Captain Salvation and several other works. Blue Water was made into a film in Canada directed by David Hartford, but it never had a theatrical release.

The town is on the Dublin-Sligo railway line. It is located on the R148 regional road, formerly the N4 national primary road connecting Dublin to Connacht. In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of Enfield grew considerably from just 566 inhabitants to 3,239 people. This increase is due to its location on the commuter belt to Dublin. Similarly to many other dormitory towns in this vicinity, numerous housing estates have been constructed, with 2016 census numbers indicating that 80% of the town's housing stock (826 of 1,024 households) was built between 1991 and 2010. Name The village's Irish name, An B√≥thar Bu√≠ (the yellow road), is derived from the yellow mud that formed on the main street of the village through a combination of rain and the churning effect of the wheels of the stagecoach on the soil. Another theory is that the name arose from the yellow colour of the ragwort vegetation at the sides of the road.  History  Enfield's phased growth is paralleled with the various phases of transport history throughout south County Meath. Going back to Ancient Times, prior to and during the early part of the first millennium A.D., the Enfield area is believed to have been situated on one of the main roads to Tara, the coronation site and seat of the High Kings of Ireland from the 3rd century until 1022. From the great heart and centre of the Irish Kingdom, five great arteries or roads radiated from Tara to the various parts of the country, namely, the Slighe (a way or path) Cualann, which ran toward the present County Wicklow, the Slighe M√≥r, the great Western road, which ran via Dublin to Galway, the Slighe Asail, which ran near the present Mullingar, the Slighe Dala, which ran southwest, and the Slighe Midluachra, the Northern road. During Norman times (from 1169) under the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Kildare, a road was built from Maynooth Castle to Courtown House in Kilcock, to the Windmill on Cappagh Hill, to Cloncurry over to Johnstown House (now the Johnstown House Hotel and Spa), and from there on to Newcastle and Balyna House. When the stagecoach was used as a form of transport in Ireland, this road took a slightly different route to include the area that is now known as Enfield. The road between Dublin and Mullingar running through Enfield was built in 1735. A livery stable and courtyard existed opposite the old post office building (now a Chinese restaurant) at the east end of the town, to service people travelling on this road. Fresh teams of horses were available for hire at the livery stable when the coaches stopped at the post office. The building also provided some stopover accommodation. Some of the remains of the original livery courtyard could be seen adjacent to the SuperValu (formerly Centra) supermarket and car park. These sites were protected once by the Office of Public Works, but have made way for redevelopment in 2014. The first postal deliveries by stagecoach, in the area, occurred around 1740, during the time of Robert Fitzgerald, 19th Earl of Kildare. In the 1790s, maps denote the site as \\"A New Inn\\", later \\"The New Inn\\" and eventually, Innfield. This derives from a mail-coach inn on the 18th century Dublin to Mullingar coach route called \\"The Royal Oak Inn\\", which is estimated to have been where the Bridge House Inn now stands. The Royal Canal also passed through Innfield, and with the arrival of the Midland Great Western Railway, the name became anglicised to Enfield. The name Innfield became Enfield towards the end of the 19th Century when a new postmaster came from Enfield, Middlesex, England and decided to use the same name for the area. The N4, the main road to the west from Dublin, passed through Enfield and plagued it with traffic problems. In December 2005, a new stretch of the M4 motorway opened and most traffic now bypasses the town. The section of the N4 which was bypassed has been redesignated as the R148. In 2013, St. Mary's National School was redeveloped and officially opened by Enda Kenny and Bishop Michael Smith of the Meath Diocese.  Transport  =Canal= Royal Canal near Enfield, County Meath The Royal Canal construction began in Dublin in 1790 and signaled the end of the stagecoach era, as the canals were a cheaper and more efficient means of transport. The stretch from Dublin to Mullingar opened as a trade route around 1807 and the canal eventually reached the Shannon in 1817, though the company was heavily in debt. The decision by the Duke of Leinster to build a spur from the canal to his country residence at Carton House was one of the contributing factors which finally broke the company. Even though rail travel was much quicker, the canal continued to carry traffic until the 1950s. It is only now, at the turn of the millennium, that the potential of the canal for tourism and as a natural amenity is being realised. The Office of Public Works took charge of it in 1986, and subsequent investment and significant restoration mean it has great prospects of becoming popular again as a means of leisurely transport. =Railway= The railway reached Enfield in 1847, when the Midland Great Western Railway opened between Broadstone Station in Dublin and Enfield railway station (opened on 28 June 1847). Upon the opening of the railway, canal boats ceased all passenger traffic between Dublin and Enfield, passengers travelling west using the train to Enfield and transferring to the canal in the town. Both the canal and the railway had stopover points in Enfield, and this contributed to the development of the area. The line was extended to Hill of Down by the end of 1847 and to Mullingar in October 1848. In 1877, a branch line from Nesbitt Junction (about west of Enfield) to Edenderry was opened. The Edenderry branch line and Enfield station closed in 1963, although there had been no regular passenger service to Edenderry since 1931. Passenger services from Enfield resumed in 1988. Enfield is located on the Sligo to Dublin rail line with termini at Sligo Mac Diarmada and Dublin Connolly, operated by Irish Rail. As of 9 December 2018, there are 10 trains into Dublin city centre & 9 westbound trains Monday to Friday, 7 trains to Dublin & 7 trains westbound on Saturdays, and on Sundays, there are 6 trains to Dublin & 6 trains westbound. =Bus= Enfield is served by Bus √âireann route 115 (Mullingar/Kilcock to Dublin) and Irish Citylink route 763 (Dublin to Galway), in addition to less regular routes run by Kearns and Mullally's.  Local amenities  Enfield Harbour, County Meath There is an amenity park along with a small harbour and slipway at the Royal Canal on the western side of the town. The local swimming pool is the Johnstown House Estate swimming pool. Enfield has several pubs along Main Street. These include 'The Sl√≠ghe M√≥r', 'The Midland Bar' and 'The Bridge House'. It also has its own micro- brewery, The Celtic Brew company based in nearby Clonard. Sport Enfield is located near The Rathcore Golf and Country Club and the Darren Clarke-designed Champions Club in Moyvalley. Na Fianna CLG (established in 2000) is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. The town is also home to Enfield Celtic Football Club, established in 1989.

Early life Charles Currelly was born on January 11, 1876 in Exeter, Ontario, the son of John Currelly and Mary Treble. An only child, he attended the local school in Exeter and was known to visit the shops of the blacksmith, tanner, and wheelwright in order to study how different materials were used. He was tutored by Reverend Jasper Wilson in Latin, who also taught him how to shoot. Currelly's high school years at the Harbord Collegiate Institute brought his family to Toronto. During this time, Currelly participated in art lessons and nature studies. After graduating in 1894, he attended the University of Toronto's Victoria College like his father and grandfather. At Victoria College, he took biology and earth science courses in addition to Asian history and Romance languages. He received his B.A. in 1898. After leaving university, Currelly spent two years serving as a lay missionary for the Methodist Church at Umatilla in northern Manitoba. During this time, he collected information on First Nations life in early Canada that was exhibited upon his return to Victoria College for postgraduate studies in the theological department. Currelly was awarded his master's degree in 1902.  Archaeology After completing his master's degree, in the spring of 1902, Currelly and his friend Ned Burwash, the son of Nathaniel Burwash, chancellor of Victoria University, went to England planning to study how Social gospel had filtered down to the working classes. However, this plan was disrupted when Currelly stopped at the British Museum to have some coins identified. After a little shawabti figure fell out of his pocket, Currelly was sent to the office of famous Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie who worked for the Egypt Exploration Fund. Petrie interviewed Currelly about his drawing skills and offered him an assistantship. Soon, Curelly was living in Petrie's home learning how to pack artifacts. Eventually, Currelly was responsible for a dig in Egypt where he discovered the cenotaph and tomb of Ahmose I. Curelly continued to work in Ehnasya, Lower Egypt, and in Sinai under Petrie until 1905, when Petrie left the Egypt Exploration Fund. In 1907, Currelly also left the Fund. While in Egypt, Currelly discovered his talent and love of collecting and began to collect for people in Britain and Canada including Edmund Walker, the father of one of his school friends. After meeting with Walker in 1905, Currelly was appointed official collector for the University of Toronto and later was given the title of curator of Oriental archaeology. Currelly applied himself to the work of collecting, becoming more and more convinced that a good museum must be developed in Toronto Royal Ontario Museum In 1906, when Edmund Walker was chairing a commission on the future of the University of Toronto, it was recommended that a museum should be constructed to serve students and the public. Soon planning for the founding of a provincial museum started under Walker's watchful eye. In 1907, Currelly was made curator of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology. During 1911, Currelly started to work in the basement of the first museum building which was still under construction. Finally, in 1914, Currelly became director of the Archaeology Museum. Throughout his life Currelly worked to advance the Museum's interests and never stopped looking for acquisitions to augment the collections, leading them to grow enormously through the late 1910s and 1920s. When Currelly finally retired in 1946, the Museum renamed the old Armour Court the Currelly Gallery. Currelly Gallery Later life and death Currelly Bust Before Currelly died, he wrote an autobiography entitled, I Brought the Ages Home. This book recounts his adventures, travels, and museum work. During his retirement Currelly lived near Port Hope, Ontario. While in Florida for a winter vacation, Curelly fell ill and was taken the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. The 81-year-old Currelly died on April 10, 1957, at the hospital where he had been receiving treatment since December. On October 7, 1957 an exhibition was held at the Museum to commemorate him. The exhibition was marked by the unveiling of a bronze bust of Currelly which was cast in 1957 by the Vandevoorde Art Foundry of Montreal. The original sculpture was created in 1919 by Canadian artist Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar. This bust and a bronze medallion of Currelly can still be viewed today in the Museum's Sackler Reading Room. Currelly Bronze Profile and Plaster Cast Publications *Researches in the Sinai.

After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the University of California at Davis in 1936 to study electrical engineering, and transferred to the campus at Berkeley two years later. He began his flying career in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, receiving his license in 1940. During World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces as an aviation cadet, and graduated from training at Williams Field, Arizona in 1942. He later flew bomber escorts and strafing missions over Europe in the P-51 Mustang with the 355th Fighter Group from D-Day through V-E Day. After the war, White completed his Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering at the UC Berkeley in 1947, and went on to become an engineering test pilot for the U.S. Air Force and North American Aviation. He participated in a variety of flight test programs over his career, including the F-86 Sabre jet, the F-100 Super Sabre series, the YF-107 and the X-15. In 1958, White was selected for the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest manned spaceflight program. The program ended early due to financial and technical difficulties. In 1961, he was selected as chief test pilot for the flight test program of the XB-70 Valkyrie, the world's largest supersonic aircraft, piloting the first flights of both XB-70s and taking the aircraft through the buildup programs to flight at Mach 3. On June 8, 1966, he was the sole survivor of the mid-air collision that destroyed the XB-70 #2 prototype and killed his co- pilot, Major Carl Cross, USAF, and noted aviator Joe Walker. White ejected from the XB-70, sustaining serious injuries, including one arm being crushed as it was caught in the clamshell-like escape capsule as it closed around him just before ejection from the aircraft. White's XB-70 shortly after the collision with Walker's F-104 Starfighter, seen in flames Later in 1966, White joined Trans World Airlines as manager of flight operations, research and development. In 1969, he became a consultant in the field of aviation and aeronautics, working primarily as an expert witness in accident investigation litigation, requiring simulation of accident flight conditions in a comparable aircraft. After 8,500 hours of flying time in over 125 different aircraft, he retired from the ranks of active pilots and settled in Tucson, Arizona. He died in Arizona in 2006. Honors White's military decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with nine oak leaf clusters. A past President and founding member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, White earned some of the top awards for his profession, including the Iven C. Kincheloe Award, the Octave Chanute Award, and the Harmon Trophy, which was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1994, he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor.

Formed in 2002, the band currently features vocalist and guitarist Roddy Stone, guitarists Frank Regan and Dom Wallace, bassist Kevin \\"Waldie\\" James and drummer Jess Margera. Founded by Stone, Regan and Waldie with guitarist Darren Smith and drummer Gordon Morrison, the group were initially intended as a semi-comedic support band for Raging Speedhorn, which featured some of Viking Skull's members. After releasing Chapter One and Born in Hell, Viking Skull came closing to breaking up when Smith and Morrison left the band in 2006. Julian \\"Jules\\" Cooper and CKY drummer Jess Margera replaced the departed members and released Chapter Two in 2007. With Rich Vose replacing Cooper and the addition of Dom Wallace, Doom, Gloom, Heartache & Whiskey was released in 2008. Regan returned for 2012's Cursed By the Sword, and following a brief hiatus, their self-titled studio release, Viking Skull was released February 2, 2016. History =2002‚Äì2006: Early years and releases= Viking Skull were formed in Corby, Northamptonshire in 2002 by Raging Speedhorn members Frank Regan, Darren Smith (both guitar) and Gordon Morrison (drums), along with their guitar technician Roddy Stone (vocals) and their merchandising manager Kevin \\"Waldie\\" James (bass). After playing at local shows for a number of months, the band recorded their debut extended play (EP) Chapter One over the course of two days with a budget of approximately ¬£500, releasing the finished product in 2003 through Grand Union Recordings. Chapter One was received positively by critics, with Metal Hammer magazine awarding its first 11 out of 10 review to the EP. In promotion of the EP, Viking Skull toured throughout 2004 in support of acts including Dio, HIM, Sum 41, Alice Cooper and Brides of Destruction, as well as performing at that year's Download Festival. In November, the group supported Murderdolls frontman Wednesday 13 on a tour of the UK. However, Regan left the band part way through the tour, forcing Stone to take on guitar duties in addition to vocals. In October 2005, the band were removed from a tour headlined by Alice Cooper and Twisted Sister, reportedly in order to increase the time given to the set of the latter. Twisted Sister's guitarist Jay Jay French later commented on the event, rejecting the group's claim that they were \\"thrown off\\" the tour and accusing the tour's management of misleading them. Later tour dates included support slots for Clutch and CKY. The band released their first full-length studio album, Born in Hell, in November 2005. Contrary to Chapter One, however, the album received mixed reviews; a review by Blabbermouth.net, for instance, described Born in Hell as \\"a short, silly, fun slab of heavy metal clich√©\\", while AllMusic's Greg Prato criticised its lyrics. The following January they were signed to 456 Entertainment, a record label co-founded by television and radio host Carson Daly. The label was used for the US release of Born in Hell later in the year, which also coincided with a short UK tour of four shows in June. The tour culminated in the band's appearance at Download Festival. =2006‚Äì2015: Lineup changes and hiatus= Jess Margera of CKY joined the band in November 2006, replacing departed original drummer Gordon Morrison. In September 2006 it was announced that both Smith and Morrison had left the band, with Stone appealing for new members. By November, Julian \\"Jules\\" Cooper (formerly in Echobelly) and CKY drummer Jess Margera had replaced the departed members, with the new lineup beginning work on an album shortly after being finalised. Margera has claimed that he \\"unwittingly had something to do with\\" the near-breakup of the band, after encouraging the members to drink on his tour bus, which led to arguments and the departure of Morrison. Explaining that CKY took a lot of time between album releases so he \\"had plenty of time to do it\\", the drummer also noted that Morrison left to focus on Raging Speedhorn. The recording of the new lineup's first album was funded by Margera and took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The result, Chapter Two, was released in September 2007 and featured guest appearances from Fireball Ministry's Reverend James Rota, Rich Vose of Gnarkill and Unkle Matt and the ShitBirdz, and CKY guitarist Chad I Ginsburg. \\"Blackened Sunrise\\" was also featured on Bam Margera's compilation album Viva la Bands, Volume 2, and a music video directed by Bam and recorded in West Chester was released for the song. A short promotional tour for the album took place in the UK in January 2008, with support from Year Long Disaster. The band played their first show in the United States on 26 July 2008 at the Filthy Note Theatre in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Margera's hometown. At the time of the show's announcement, it was also reported that the group would be commencing work on their third album Doom, Gloom, Heartache & Whiskey whilst in the US, with Ginsburg leading its production. The album was released in November on Powerage Records, a new label co-founded by Classic Rock magazine. It was supported on a UK tour in December, as well as a stint supporting Clutch in the US before the end of the month. For the tour, newly recruited guitarist Vose was replaced by the returning Darren Smith, due to Vose \\"being missing and not being able to be contacted\\". Original guitarist Frank Regan rejoined Viking Skull at the beginning of 2010 and the group set about work on their next album, which a posting on their MySpace page described as being \\"balls-out, meat-and-potatoes riffs (as always), but having the humour of Chapter One and Born in Hell\\". In October the compilation Heavy Metal Thunder was released, which included remastered versions of both Chapter One and Born in Hell, as well as a number of previously unreleased bonus tracks. The band's third studio album Cursed By the Sword followed in May 2012, released by Transcend Music. The group went on hiatus after the album's release. =2015‚Äìpresent: Return and fourth album= In January 2015, the band started a Kickstarter project in order to fund a potential new studio album entitled Chapter III (later renamed Viking Skull), asking for ¬£10,000 in donations from fans. The album was originally estimated for an October release date by frontman Stone, although this was later pushed back to early 2016. The band also completed a short tour of UK venues in February 2016. Musical style Viking Skull are commonly categorised as a hard rock and heavy metal band. They are said to be heavily influenced by Black Sabbath, with additional stylistic comparisons including AC/DC, Mot√∂rhead, The Who, Riot, Thin Lizzy, Kiss and W.A.S.P. In a review of Born in Hell for Blabbermouth.net, Keith Bergman described the group as \\"swaggering UK cock-rockers\\", while Greg Prato of AllMusic dubbed them as \\"down 'n' dirty biker rock\\". Drummer Jess Margera described the band's sound in a 2008 interview as \\"straight up beer drinking rock in the vein of Mot√∂rhead, [Iron] Maiden, [Black] Sabbath, and AC/DC\\", while the Crew Guardian noted that the band mix the musical styles of their influences with \\"whiskey drenched vocals\\" to create \\"an uncompromising brand of classic metal of their own.\\" Band members ;Current members *Roddy Stone ‚Äì vocals, guitar (2002‚Äìpresent) *Frank Regan ‚Äì guitar (2002‚Äì2004, 2010‚Äìpresent) *Dom Wallace ‚Äì guitar (2008‚Äìpresent) *Kevin \\"Waldie\\" James ‚Äì bass (2002‚Äìpresent) *Jess Margera ‚Äì drums (2006‚Äìpresent) ;Former members *Darren Smith ‚Äì guitar (2002‚Äì2006, 2008) *Gordon Morrison ‚Äì drums (2002‚Äì2006) *Julian \\"Jules\\" Cooper ‚Äì guitar (2006‚Äì2008) *Rich Vose ‚Äì guitar (2008) Discography ;Studio albums { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Title !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Album details - !scope=\\"row\\"Born in Hell  *Released: 14 October 2005 *Label: Grand Union *Format: CD - !scope=\\"row\\"Chapter Two  *Released: 8 September 2007 *Labels: DPR/Filthy Note *Formats: CD, DL - !scope=\\"row\\"Doom, Gloom, Heartache & Whiskey  *Released: 3 November 2008 *Label: Powerage *Formats: CD, DL - !scope=\\"row\\"Cursed By the Sword  *Released: 28 May 2012 *Label: Transcend *Formats: LP, DL - !scope=\\"row\\"Viking Skull  *Released: 2 February 2016 *Label: none (self- released) *Formats: LP, DL } ;Live albums { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Title !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Album details - !scope=\\"row\\"Live at Voodoo Lounge  *Released: 11 September 2015 *Label: none (self-released) *Format: DL } ;Compilation albums { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Title !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Album details - !scope=\\"row\\"Heavy Metal Thunder  *Released: 26 October 2010 *Label: none (self-released) *Formats: CD, DL } ;Extended plays { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Title !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em\\"Album details - !scope=\\"row\\"Chapter One  *Released: 20 October 2003 *Label: Grand Union *Format: CD - !scope=\\"row\\"Blackened Sunrise  *Released: 8 September 2007 *Labels: DPR/Filthy Note *Format: CD } References External links *Viking Skull on Facebook *Viking Skull on MySpace English hard rock musical groups English heavy metal musical groups Musical groups established in 2002 2002 establishments in England ","title":"Viking Skull"},{"id":"5000898","text":"Phil Leadbetter (born March 31, 1962) is one of the leading players of the resonator guitar.

He released a solo CD \\"The Next Move\\" in the fall of 2015. In March 2016, Leadbetter left the Dale Ann Bradley band to help form the bluegrass group Flashback. The members of Flashback were in the original Grammy nominated J. D Crowe And the New South band from 1994. Flashback and Crowe toured during 2015 on a 20-year reunion tour. At the end of 2015, Crowe retired from music, but the band continued to perform under the name \\"Flashback\\".

The OFT's decision had been to accept commitments from a number of online travel agents (OTAs) and InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG).

It is therefore considered more important than secondary classifications as the points classification or the mountains classification. Since 1931, the leader of the general classification is identified by a pink jersey ( ). The first rider to wear the maglia rosa was Learco Guerra following the first stage of the 1931 Giro d'Italia. The first jersey was entirely pink and made from wool. It had a roll-neck collar and front pockets. As Italy was under Fascist Party rule there was a gray shield stitched onto the shirt, a symbol for the party. This initial jersey and many of the first pink jerseys were designed by Vittore Gianni who had created jerseys for AC Milan and Juventus. Since 2000, the pink jersey has been altered between years from being exclusively solid pink, like in 2006 there was a bike pattern on the jersey in a darker shade of pink. To celebrate the 2009 Giro d'Italia which was on the 100th anniversary of the race's beginning in 1909, the jersey had side panels displaying the Italian colors of green, white, and red and was designed by Dolce and Gabbana. Other designers that have designed a maglia rosa include Paul Smith and Fergus Niland, the latter of which made all the classification jerseys have a shamrock pattern while the 2014 race raced throughout Ireland. In the first editions of the Giro d'Italia, a points system was used for the calculation of the general classification, but since 1914 a time system is used. All stage results are added together, taking into account time bonuses for high finishes and intermediate sprints, and time penalties for breaking the rules. The color pink was chosen because La Gazzetta dello Sport, the sports newspaper that created the Giro, was printed on pink paper. In comparison, the leader of the general classification in the Tour de France is awarded a yellow jersey, which originally corresponds with the yellow newsprint of L'Auto, the newspaper that created the Tour de France.

It is mainly attributed to Dance Guru Meenakshi sundaram Pillai (1869‚Äì1964), a dance guru who lived in the village of Pandanallur, in the Thanjavur district in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Teachers Meenakshisundaram Pillai, whose ancestors were nattuvanars, was a descendant from the Thanjavur Quartet, which comprised four brothers: Chinnaiah, Ponniah, Sivanandam and Vadivel. The works of these four brothers, who were court composers in the early 19th century in Thanjavur, form the main classical masterpieces of Bharata Natyam. Baroda Guru Kubernath Tanjorkar (1916 - 2007), a disciple of Pillai, later established Tanjor Dance Music & Art Research Centre in Baroda, Gujarat. Thiruvallaputhur Swaminatha Pillai, also known as T.K.Swaminatha Pillai, was one of the leading disciples of Pillai. He learned Bharathanatiyam under the Gurukula of Pillai for more than ten years. He also mentored Ram Gopal, who became one of the pioneers of Indian dance in the west. Pillai was said to have been trained by his uncle, Kumarasamy Nattuvanar. He trained several famous Bharata Natyam dancers, including Devadasis such as Pandanallur Jayalakshmi, Thangachi Ammal, Sabaranjitam, as well as people from other castes such as Mrinalini Sarabhai, Rukmini Devi, Tara Chaudhri. After Pillai, his son-in-law Chokkalingam Pillai (1893‚Äì1968) became the doyen Guru of the Pandanallur style. His leading dancer-student was Mambalam Geetha. He trained other leading dancers such as G. Kausalya, Sucharita, and Indrani Rehman. He shifted to Madras and propagated his dance throughout the region. Subbaraya Pillai (1914‚Äì2008), Chokkalingam Pillai's son, was the next leading Guru of the Pandanallur style. He grew up in the village of Pandanallur and was an apprentice under his grandfather and father. He trained leading dancers such as Alarmel Valli and Meenakshi Chitharanjan. His granddaughter Vanitha Rajasekar teaches dance in Valasaravakkam, Chennai-87 and other regions of Tamil Nadu. Style The Pandanallur style developed a reputation for the emphasis on linear geometry that can be found in the adavu technique, and for its intensity and understatement in abhinaya. The Pandanallur style is renowned for its choreography, which include such highly regarded pieces as the Nine or Ten Tanjore Quartet pada-varnams . These works featured choreography by Pillai, who named the dramatic choreography \\"hands,\\" and was also responsible for the adavu choreography for the swara passages. Part of their heritage is the valuable jatiswarams (in ragams Vasantha, Saveri, Chakravakam, Kalyani, Bhairavi), which incorporate abstract adavu choreography. Pandanallur style gives a lot of importance to abinayaha. Moreover, stamping the foot hard against the floor is discouraged in this style. Instead, slow movements are used to make the salangai (ankle bells) give out a lot of noise. The strong Footwork whereby every Step is marked, is a result of one the Arts Music main feature of exactness and accuracy to bring out the Rhythmic vitality as the Dancer is required to have a Natural Rhythmic Body of expression.

The basic camel spin position is defined as one in which the free leg is extended backwards with the knee held above hip level. History Most sources credit the invention of the camel spin to British skater Cecilia Colledge, who first performed it successfully in competition in 1935.http://figureskating.about.com/od/glossaryofskatingterms/g/camel.htm Jo Ann Schneider Farris - Camel Spin, Accessed on June 27, 2014 Like the layback spin, also invented by Colledge, the camel was originally considered a move for women only. The origin of the spin's name is disputed. Most authorities believe that the name originated when a skater performed the spin with her upper body and free leg drooping down, giving the illusion of a hunched camel. According to figure skating coach Gustave Lussi, the spin was invented not by Colledge but by an Australian skater named Campbell, thus explaining that \\"Campbell spin\\" became corrupted into \\"camel spin\\". The Grafstr√∂m spin may predate the invention of the \\"regular\\" camel spin. Although it is named after Gillis Grafstr√∂m, its best practitioner is said to be Czechoslovakian skater Otto Gold, who won the silver medal at the 1930 European Figure Skating Championships. Dick Button is credited with inventing the flying camel spin in the 1940s. It was originally known as the Button camel. The \\"illusion spin\\" was accidentally invented by Jacqueline du Bief when she lost control on the entrance to a camel spin. Several female pair skaters have suffered head/face injuries after their partners accidentally drifted too close during side-by- side camel spins ‚Äì Elena Berezhnaya, Jessica Dub√©, Mandy W√∂tzel, and Galina Maniachenko. Variations * Flying camel spin ‚Äì formerly known as a Button camel, initiated with a jump from a forward outside edge to a back camel spin. * Layover ‚Äì performed by upturning the torso and free leg so that the skater's torso and free foot are pointing toward the ceiling, rather than toward the ice. This spin is frequently seen in artistic roller skating, where it is called a \\"layback spin\\" (but is distinct from the layback spin performed on ice). ** Bent-leg layover ‚Äì similar to a layover, except with a bent free leg. Jos√©e ChouinardBeverley Smith, Figure Skating: A Celebration, , page 252 and Yuna Kim are among the best-known practitioners of this spin variation. Both have used it as one of their signature moves. * Catch-foot camel ‚Äì performed by the skater grasping the free leg's blade with either hand. The skater's torso remains pointed toward the ice, and the free leg is held upward. A catch-foot camel with free leg extended upwards is sometimes called a one-hand Biellman or a half-Biellmann‚Äînamed for Swiss skater Denise Biellmann, who popularized the move in the 1970s and '80s. ** Doughnut or donut spin ‚Äì a catch-foot camel, but the skater's head is pulled toward the free leg's foot so that the skater's head, torso, and free leg form a toric shape parallel to the ice. Oksana Baiul, Yukari Nakano frequently perform this spin.Nakano still determined to achieve more on the ice 2007-11-23, Icenetwork.com * Grafstr√∂m spin ‚Äì camel with a bent skating leg, with the free foot still in the arabesque position. * Hamill camel ‚Äì not a true camel per se, but rather a transition from a backwards camel to a backwards sit spin by bending the skating leg and dropping the torso and free leg simultaneously. * Illusion spin ‚Äì performed by the skater keeping their head, torso, and free leg in a straight line, and rhythmically bobbing above and below the position of a standard camel spin. Tiffany Chin performed this spin frequently as an amateur. * Forward Camel with change of edge ‚Äì this spin starts off as a regular camel spin. Then the skater changes back to a forward outside edge and continues to spin in small forward outside circles and then switches back to a regular camel spin. This move requires a lot of control and power.

Fort Massachusetts is a fort on West Ship Island along the Mississippi Gulf Coast of the United States. It was built following the War of 1812, with brick walls during 1859‚Äì1866, and remained in use until 1903. Currently, it is a historical tourist attraction within the Gulf Islands National Seashore. The fort is located about halfway along the north shore of West Ship Island, near a boat pier. History of the Fort Following the War of 1812, the United States War Department began planning for the construction of an extensive system of masonry fortifications for coastal defense. Because of Ship Island's natural deep-water harbor and its location along a shipping route, Ship Island was important to the defense of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. The island was declared a United States military reservation in 1847, and nine years later Congress authorized construction of a fort. A site on the north shore, approximately 500 feet (152 m) from the western tip of the island, was eventually selected as the location for the fort. Construction began in June 1859 under supervision of the Army Corps of Engineers. The work was primarily done by civilians. The work force sometimes numbered as many as 100 men, and included carpenters, stonemasons, blacksmiths, and stonecutters. By early 1861, the outside wall of the fort stood 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) above the level of the sand. In January 1861, Mississippi seceded from the Union, becoming the second state of the Confederacy. One of the first acts of war in the state occurred on Ship Island when an armed band of Mississippi militia took possession of the island and the unfinished fort. The militia soon abandoned the island; and it remained deserted until early June 1861, when Confederate troops returned and mounted several cannons. On July 9, the Union Navy's came within range of the Confederate guns. The 20-minute exchange of cannon fire which followed resulted in few injuries and little damage, to either side. That action was the only military engagement in which Ship Island or the fort would be directly involved. During the remainder of the summer of 1861, the Confederate contingent on the island worked with sandbags and timber to strengthen the walls of the unfinished fort. Despite their work, they abandoned the island in mid-September. Entrance to Fort Massachusetts. Union military forces soon occupied the island. Ship Island was used as the staging area for the Union's successful capture of New Orleans in the spring of 1862. As many as 18,000 U.S. troops were stationed on the island. The island's harsh environment took its toll on many of the men. More than 230 Union soldiers eventually died and were buried on Ship Island during the Civil War. The remains of many of the casualties were later reburied at Chalmette National Cemetery, near New Orleans. Through the remainder of the war (1862‚Äì65), Union forces made use of Ship Island. Union ships stopped at the island for repairs and to pick up supplies. The 1st Louisiana Native Guard, one of the first black regiments in the United States Army, were recruited in Louisiana and stationed there for almost three years. A hospital, barracks, mess hall, and bakery were just a few of nearly 40 buildings constructed on the island during the war. In addition, the Army Corps of Engineers resumed construction of the fort itself in 1862. It was during this period the fort was first called \\"Massachusetts,\\" probably in honor of the USS Massachusetts. However, the fort was never officially named; it was referred to simply as the \\"Fort on Ship Island\\" in most official records. Although the fort switched hands during the first year of the war, the only government to lay bricks was the United States. Between the beginning of construction and the secession of the Southern states (1859‚Äì61), the Army obtained its bricks from Louisiana. After U.S. authorities regained control of the island (1861‚Äì62), bricks were shipped from New England, down the East Coast and around the Florida peninsula. After the war ended (1865), the bricks were again procured in Louisiana. Still today, distinct color differences can be seen on the walls of the fort where different types of brick were laid. The Corps of Engineers continued work on the fort until the fall of 1866. It was then turned over to a civilian fort keeper C.H. \\"Pop\\" Stone whose duty it was to maintain the fort in a state of readiness. After cannons were mounted, an ordnance-sergeant was assigned to care for the fort's armament. He eventually assumed all responsibility for the upkeep of the fort. The last ordnance-sergeant was relieved of duty in 1903, and the Ship Island lighthouse keeper became the fort's caretaker. Restoration Debris from Hurricane Katrina inside Fort Massachusetts. Fort Massachusetts had lain at the water's edge; and wave action, not to mention the salt air, had seriously eroded the historic mortar, especially around the northeast bastion. A \\"Save the Fort\\" movement started by Mississippians in the 1960s led to the establishment of Gulf Islands National Seashore. But, unlike the Cape Hatteras Light, Fort Massachusetts is made of tons of brick and concrete, and it could not be relocated. Beach nourishment is one way of protecting the historic landmark. To save tax dollars, the National Park Service piggy-backs on dredge projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The dredgers remove sand from ship channels and pump it toward the fort. A sandy beach is thereby created, as a barrier against the sea water lapping at the structure's walls. In addition, employees from the Historic Preservation Training Center stepped ashore in December 2001 to re-point, replace, and reset, as needed, the brick walls of the fort‚Äîwhich hadn't been maintained since 1866.

It was the successor to Para-Ordnance, founded in Canada in 1985. It specialized in making M1911-style semi-automatic pistols and components. The company was acquired by Remington Outdoor Company in 2012. In 2015, the Para brand ceased production and was folded into Remington.{{cite weburl=https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/breaking-remington-kills-para-usa- brand/ History Para-Ordnance was founded in Canada in 1985 by two childhood friends, Ted Szabo and Thanos Polyzos. Szabo was born in Hungary and his family fled the country when the Soviets invaded during the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. Polyzos was born in Greece and later emigrated to Canada. On March 28, 2007, Ted Szabo died at the age of 60. The company's first product was a plastic paintball gun, the Model 85 \\"Dye Marking Tactical Machine Pistol\\", designed for police and military training purposes. Para- Ordnance Mfg Inc. had a factory in Markham, Ontario, Canada. When last reported, the company was estimated to have an annual revenue of over 9 million dollars and employ a staff of 60. In January 2009, it was announced that the U.S. headquarters for Para-Ordnance's U.S. subsidiary (Para USA) would be set up in Pineville, North Carolina. Eventually, Para Ordnance moved to North Carolina and became a totally U.S. company, Para USA. In January 2012, Para USA was acquired to become a part of the Freedom Group, a consortium of firearms manufacturers owned by Cerberus Capital Management, a New York private equity investment firm. Remington is Para USA's immediate corporate parent. Since 2007, Remington Arms had been part of the Remington Outdoor Company (ROC NYSE), which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management. Freedom Group had previously purchased Marlin Firearms and DPMS Panther Arms in 2007. Cerberus combined DPMS and other firearm companies with Remington Arms, Bushmaster Firearms International, and Cobb Manufacturing to form the Freedom Group. In 2014, the six subsidiary companies that would relocate and consolidate into Remington Arms's new state-of-the-art non-union production facility in Huntsville, Alabama were: Advanced Armament Corp, Lawrenceville, Georgia; Montana Rifleman, Kalispell, Montana; TAPCO, Kennesaw, Georgia; LAR Manufacturing, West Jordan, Utah; DPMS Panther Arms, St. Cloud, Minnesota; and Para USA (Para-Ordnance), Pineville, North Carolina. Remington stated that it would consolidate its production from those six locations into Huntsville in order to increase efficiency, and reduce production and labor costs.Remington to move production of two gun lines from New York to Alabama Remington Arms moving 1200 jobs from NY to Alabama /Minnesota St. Cloud based gun maker moving to Alabama St. Cloud gunmaker moving to Alabama In February 2015, Remington Outdoor Company announced that the \\"integration\\" of Para USA into Remington would occur with the move of Para USA to Remington's Huntville, Alabama facility in March 2015. This also included the cessation of the Para name as a separate brand in the Freedom Group. Products Para offers a wide range of products for the law enforcement, military, and civilian markets. Para-Ordnance was the originator of a high capacity magazine M1911-style pistol. Para-Ordnance was also the manufacturer of the first double-action-only 1911-style pistol. The company has created a true double- stack 1911 pistol, in addition to single- and double-stack pistols in .45 ACP, .40 S&W;, 9 mm Parabellum, and .38 Super calibers. Para pistols have found a variety of uses, including competition, law enforcement, concealed carry, and general shooting. The introduction of the LDA (Light Double Action) allowed law enforcement agencies to use 1911-style pistols while still addressing the perceived liability issues of a single-action pistol. In 2009, Para-Ordnance purchased the rights to the LR-300 and announced its version as the TTR \\"Tactical Target Rifle\\", which featured an over-the-barrel delayed gas blowback system, dubbed DIGS, which lessens recoil when compared with a traditional gas system. The TTR also relocated the recoil spring assembly over the barrel and under the handguard, allowing it to have a true folding stock. Production ceased in 2011 when Para USA exited the rifle market.

He served as the district attorney for Durham County, North Carolina until he was removed, disbarred and jailed following court findings concerning his conduct in the Duke lacrosse case, primarily his conspiring with the DNA lab director to withhold exculpatory DNA evidence that could have acquitted the defendants. Early life Nifong was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) in 1971 with a degree in political science. He registered as a conscientious objector and participated in anti-war protests during the Vietnam War. After working as a teacher and social worker, Nifong returned to UNC in 1975 and earned a J.D. degree from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 1978. He was admitted to the North Carolina bar. Career After spending a year as a per diem assistant with the Durham County District Attorney's office, Nifong was hired on a full-time basis in 1979. He eventually worked his way up to chief assistant. After District Attorney Jim Hardin was appointed to a Superior Court vacancy in 2005, Governor Mike Easley appointed Nifong to fill out the remainder of Hardin's term. Nifong was sworn in on April 27, 2005. As the Duke lacrosse case unfolded, Nifong won the Democratic primary on May 2, 2006 for Durham County District Attorney. He won the general election in November 2006 by a close margin of 833 votes. Duke lacrosse case In 2006, Nifong pursued rape, sexual assault, and kidnapping charges, against Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty, and David Evans, three white members of the Duke University men's lacrosse team. Made by Crystal Mangum, a local black woman who was working as a call girl and stripper The case attracted national and international media attention. Former New York Times public editor Daniel Okrent wrote, \\"It [the case] conformed too well to too many preconceived notions of too many in the press: white over black, rich over poor, athletes over non-athletes, men over women, educated over non- educated.\\" In the first weeks of the case, Nifong gave an estimated 50 to 70 interviews. On the day he received his first briefing by police, March 27, 2006, he told the press, \\"The circumstances of the rape indicated a deep racial motivation for some of the things that were done.\\" By April 1, he had made 48 statements to the press, including assertions that others present at the party where the alleged assault took place who were covering for the accused players, saying, \\"I would like to think that somebody who was not in the bathroom has the human decency to call up and say, 'What am I doing covering up for a bunch of hooligans?'\\" Initial media reports on the case largely reflected Nifong's statements and opinions. Nifong said in a court hearing on October 27, six months after the arrest of Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans, that he had not yet interviewed the alleged victim. \\"I haven't talked with her about the facts of that night...We're not at that stage yet.\\" According to Nifong, none of his assistants had discussed the case with her, either. On December 22, 2006, Nifong dropped the rape charge (while the sexual assault and kidnapping charges were still being pursued) against the three lacrosse players after Mangum changed her story, saying that she was no longer certain whether she was penetrated vaginally by one or more of the men. This was a few days after it was revealed in court that Nifong had withheld evidence from the defense concerning DNA tests. Nifong was strongly criticized for pressing ahead with what appeared to many to be a weak case without any physical evidence. The defense argued that Mangum had given at least a dozen different accounts of the incident, changing the number of attackers from twenty to three, and modifying the methods by which she was assaulted. In January 2007, Nifong sent a letter to then-North Carolina Attorney General Roy A. Cooper, asking his office to assume responsibility of the case. This came days after Mangum changed her story again, claiming that suspect Seligmann was not involved in the alleged attack. Previously she had accused him and two others of the alleged rape. The next day, Cooper announced that his office would take over the case. In April, he announced that charges against the three players would be dropped and that \\"based on the significant inconsistencies between the evidence and the various accounts given by the accusing witness, we believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges\\". =Criticism= Defense lawyers and media outlets were strongly critical of Nifong's handling of the case. Nifong said that the criticisms were the product of a defense strategy to malign the prosecution and intimidate the alleged rape victim. As the details of the case emerged, Nifong was attacked not only from advocates of the indicted students but by news sources such as The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. They claimed he went public with a series of accusations that later turned out to be untrue; that he exaggerated and intensified racial tensions; that he unduly influenced the Durham police investigation; that he tried to manipulate potential witnesses; that he refused to hear exculpatory evidence before indictment; that regulations on the conduct of an identification exercise were breached by failure to include \\"dummy\\" photographs of anyone who was not at the party; that he had never spoken directly to the alleged victim about the accusations; and that he made misleadingly incomplete presentations of various aspects of the evidence in the case (including DNA results). Additional coverage critical of the prosecution's case included that expressed by: 60 Minutes, Charlotte Observer, Fox News, Greensboro News & Record,National Journal, Newark Star- Ledger, The News & Observer, Newsweek, New York Daily News, New York magazine, San Diego Union Tribune, Washington Times, The Star-News (Wilmington, N.C.),, and the now-defunct Rocky Mountain News. Nifong gave more than 50 interviews, many with the national media, according to his own account and confirmed by the News & Observer. In these interviews, Nifong repeatedly said that he was \\"confident that a rape occurred\\", calling the players \\"a bunch of hooligans\\" whose \\"daddies could buy them expensive lawyers.\\" From early April 2006, however, Nifong generally refused to talk to the media. On July 18, 2006, defense lawyers charged that Nifong made \\"unprofessional and discourteous\\" remarks. During a preliminary hearing, Nifong said, \\"[Defense] attorneys were almost disappointed that their clients didn't get indicted so they could be a part of this spectacle here in Durham.\\" One lawyer asserted that \\"Nifong's statement is an insult to the legal profession as a whole and is certainly unwarranted by any facts in this case.\\" Others saw it as a personal insult. Nifong then went on vacation and could not be reached for further comment. On October 27, 2006, Nifong said in court that neither he nor his assistants had yet discussed the alleged assault with the accuser, saying they had so far left that aspect of the investigation to the police. Critics of the district attorney requested that Nifong be investigated, punished and disbarred for his actions in this case. On December 12, 2006, Republican Representative Walter B. Jones of North Carolina's 3rd district was reported to have sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking for an investigation into whether Nifong committed \\"prosecutorial misconduct\\" and violated the civil rights of the three suspects in the case; Gonzales stated that his office might investigate how Nifong had handled the case. Critics noted that police were instructed to \\"Go through Mr. Nifong for any directions as to how to conduct matters in this case.\\" This was an unusual move for a prosecutor to order. On December 16, 2006, it was revealed that Nifong and DNA lab director Brian Meehan conspired to withhold exculpatory DNA evidence from the final report submitted to the defense team. The prosecution of the case was criticized by the legal analyst for the National Journal, Stuart Taylor, as well as New York Times columnists David Brooks and Nicholas Kristof. An investigation by CBS' 60 Minutes \\"reveal[ed] disturbing facts about the conduct of the police and the district attorney, and raise[d] serious concerns.\\" (This 60 Minutes segment was honored with a Peabody Award on April 4, 2007.) Several writers at Slate criticized the prosecution's actions and especially criticized the mainstream media for accepting prosecution claims at face value in spite of countervailing evidence. In light of the fact that Nifong failed to turn over exculpatory evidence to defense lawyers on December 22, 2006, The News & Observer wrote that \\"to press forward in the [...] case, District Attorney Mike Nifong must rely on scanty evidence while deflecting serious questions about whether he broke the law or violated the ethics rules governing prosecutors.\\" Thomas Sowell accused Nifong of using the case to improve his chances in the next election by gaining large support from the African American community. Nifong ultimately won the primary and general election in the midst of the case, despite the fact that allegations of ethical improprieties had already come to light. A federal judge in 2011 ruled that the civil lawsuit could proceed against Nifong, including claims of \\"malicious prosecution\\" and \\"fabrication of false evidence\\". Ethics charges On December 28, 2006, the North Carolina State Bar filed ethics charges against Nifong over his conduct in the case, accusing him of making public statements that were \\"prejudicial to the administration of justice\\" and of engaging in \\"conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\\" The seventeen-page document accuses Nifong of violating four rules of professional conduct, listing more than fifty examples of statements he made to the media. The State Bar filed a second round of ethics charges on January 24, 2007.Findlaw.com Digital image of thirty-three page Amended Complaint, as filed. In this document, it accused Nifong of a \\"systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion ... prejudicial to the administration of justice\\" when he withheld DNA evidence to mislead the court. Nifong's lawyers filed a report asking for dismissal of some of the charges against him on March 19, arguing that his actions had not prevented the defendants from a fair trial since defense attorneys received a DNA report before a trial date was set. The State Bar denied the request, pointing out that North Carolina law \\"is unambiguous: Anyone subject to an NTO [Nontestimonial Identification Order] must be given any report of test results as soon as such a report is available.\\" The Bar continued that \\"Nifong is effectively arguing that he can make false statements to a court which result in the entry of an order, and then use the order that is based on his misrepresentations to claim he committed no discovery violation.\\" At an April 13 hearing, another request for dismissal of charges was denied. Nifong's team argued that the law about revealing exculpatory evidence to the defense was too vague about a timetable. Attorneys for the State Bar pointed out that it was only through diligent efforts of the Duke players' defense team that the DNA report was finally made available to them. The formal ethics hearing began on June 12 in Raleigh. On June 15, Nifong took the stand to testify in his own defense. During the testimony, he apologized to the families of the Duke athletes and stated that he would resign as district attorney. Joseph Cheshire, attorney for David Evans, one of the accused players, dismissed the apology as \\"a cynical political attempt to save his law license\\". During the trial, Nifong acknowledged he knew there was no DNA evidence connecting lacrosse players Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty to the 28-year-old woman who accused them of attacking her when he indicted them on charges of rape, sexual offense and kidnapping a year prior. Disbarment On June 16, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Committee unanimously voted to disbar Nifong after delivering a guilty verdict to 27 of 32 charges. The committee found Nifong's previous disciplinary record and acknowledgment of his improper pre-trial statements were substantially outweighed by (among other things) the players' vulnerability and his failure to acknowledge the \\"wrongful nature of (his) conduct with respect of the handling of DNA evidence.\\" Committee chair Lane Williamson called the case a \\"fiasco\\" and said Nifong's actions involved \\"dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation.\\" Williamson further stated, \\"At the time he was facing a primary, and yes, he was politically naive, but we can draw no other conclusion that those initial statements he made were to further his political ambitions.\\" In the end, the panel concluded that \\"there is no discipline short of disbarment appropriate in this case given the magnitude of the offenses found.\\" Nifong agreed to surrender his law license and said he would not appeal; through his attorney, he said that disbarment was an appropriate punishment. Nifong is the first sitting district attorney in the history of North Carolina to be disbarred. Earlier in the day, Nifong offered to voluntarily surrender his law license. However, Williamson said that the panel had to issue a ruling, and issued its disbarment order shortly thereafter. Under North Carolina law, the order took effect 30 days after Nifong received it in writing. Immediately after the hearing, lawyers for the three players said they would seek to have Nifong held in criminal contempt of court for his false statements. The lawyers added that calls for a federal civil rights investigation into the matter weren't out of line. The players' attorneys called for an independent investigation into the case, and Cooper was considering whether to open a criminal probe into the affair. The players' attorneys said on June 18 that their clients were very likely to file a civil suit against Nifong to recover their legal expenses and restore their reputations. It is not known how much they can recover; Nifong had no income aside from his salary as DA, and public records indicate that he has no significant assets other than his home in Durham, real estate in western North Carolina and retirement accounts. According to The News and Observer, the players incurred $3 million in legal costs. On June 18, Nifong submitted his resignation to Governor Easley and Durham County Chief Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson, saying he would leave office on July 13. Hudson said that Nifong should have resigned immediately, saying that defense attorneys could challenge Nifong's authority. Easley, a former prosecutor and state attorney general, also felt that Nifong should have resigned immediately. Early on June 19, Hudson issued an order suspending Nifong from office with pay. Under North Carolina law,GS_7A-66 this was the first step in a process that allows the chief judge of a county to remove that county's district attorney from office. Hudson also appointed a Raleigh attorney as special prosecutor to oversee the removal proceeding. A Durham resident, Beth Brewer had asked Hudson to remove Nifong in February on the grounds that Nifong engaged in willful misconduct and brought disrepute upon his office ‚Äì two of the criteria required for removing a district attorney from office. This process has been used only once before, when the district attorney for New Hanover and Pender counties was removed from office in 1995 for making a racial slur. On June 20, Nifong began talks with the special prosecutor about the possibility of leaving office immediately, but later that day, Easley appointed Jim Hardin, Nifong's predecessor, as acting district attorney. This came hours after Easley signed a bill that would allow the governor to remove a district attorney or judge from office if he or she has been disbarred or suspended from practicing law.Senate Bill 118-Third Edition , ncleg.net; accessed November 21, 2014.Jim Hardin Named To Replace Mike Nifong , wxii12.com; accessed November 21, 2014. Easley strongly supported the bill, which unanimously passed both houses of the legislature.North Carolina General Assembly ‚Äì Senate Bill 118 Information/History (2007‚Äì08 Session) ; accessed November 21, 2014. Easley had let it be known that he would have removed Nifong from office immediately if he had had the authority and power to do so. It had been unclear how soon Easley could have removed Nifong under this new law. The bill does not allow a governor to remove a DA or judge until the State Bar formally issued its order of disbarment, and all appeals have been exhausted. However, as mentioned above, Nifong had said he would not appeal. Hardin was sworn in the next day, and served until September 2007, when Easley appointed Assistant District Attorney David Saacks to fill out the first half of Nifong's term. At the time of Hardin's swearing-in, negotiations were still under way between Nifong and the special prosecutor, and Hudson was proceeding with the hearing to remove him for good. However, according to a spokesman for the state's Administrative Office of the Courts, Nifong's tenure as DA ended with Hardin's swearing-in. Nifong formally resigned from office on July 2. Nifong's former assistant district attorney, Tracey Cline, was elected District Attorney in a 2008 special election and re-elected in 2010. She was removed from office herself in 2012 for, among other things, making defamatory accusations against Judge Hudson. Her license to practice law was suspended for five years in 2015 but she was not disbarred.Tracey Cline law license suspended , newsobserver.com; accessed May 30, 2016. On June 22, the players' lawyers filed their motion asking Superior Court Judge Osmond Smith, who presided over the case, to hold Nifong in contempt. The players also wanted Nifong to pay for the 60 to 100 hours it took to prove that he misrepresented the DNA evidence. Nifong was charged with having violated at least a dozen laws, rules and court orders designed to protect defendants' rights by playing \\"a game of hide and seek\\" with evidence that could have cleared the players. The players' motion also alleged that Nifong's misconduct \\"shocks the conscience and defies any notion of accident or negligence\\". Earlier that same month, Judge Smith had filed papers stating that he retained control over the case although the charges had been dismissed, and had the power to impose his own sanctions against Nifong. On July 25, Nifong issued a less qualified apology for his actions, saying he did not challenge Cooper's conclusion that there was \\"no credible evidence\\" to support the charges he had made. While the players' attorneys expressed skepticism about his sincerity, they did withdraw their demands that he pay for the legal work it took to ferret out the DNA evidence. In a letter addressed to the North Carolina State Bar on August 7, Nifong formally surrendered his law license. He then decried the \\"fundamental unfairness\\" with which his disbarment was conducted, contradicting his own lawyer's assertion that Nifong believed disbarment to be an appropriate punishment. To explain the physical condition of the license, Nifong said the license had been damaged \\"by a puppy in her chewing stage\\", and therefore had never been framed or displayed. Sentence and jail On September 7, 2007, after having already been disbarred, Nifong reported to the Durham County jail to serve a one-day jail sentence for contempt of court. He was held alone in a cell for his protection. Sued by players On October 5, 2007, Evans, Finnerty, and Seligmann filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Nifong engineered a wide-ranging conspiracy to frame the players. Also named in the suit were the lab that handled the DNA work, the city of Durham, the city's former police chief, the deputy police chief, the two police detectives who handled the case and five other police department employees. The players sought unspecified damages, and wanted to place the Durham Police Department under court supervision for 10 years, claiming the actions of the police department pose \\"a substantial risk of irreparable injury to other persons in the City of Durham.\\" According to the suit, Nifong's sole motive was to win support for his reelection bid; the suit alleges that Nifong told his campaign manager that the case would provide \\"'millions of dollars' in free advertising.\\" This allegation is confirmed by The New York Times, and by an interview with Nifong's campaign manager. Nifong asked the state attorney general's office and the Administrative Office of the Courts to pay his legal fees and help defend him, but both offices refused on the grounds that Nifong's actions involved \\"fraud, corruption (and) malice.\\" Bankruptcy filing On January 15, 2008, Nifong filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. He listed assets of almost $244,000 and liabilities of over $180.3 million, virtually all of which derived from six $30 million \\"unsecured nonpriority claims\\", one for each of the six members of the 2005‚Äì06 Duke lacrosse team suing Nifong, among others. While the bankruptcy filing automatically delayed the civil suit against him, it may not protect Nifong from civil liability for his actions in the case. Unsecured creditors can still pursue claims against someone filing for bankruptcy if the debt was incurred through \\"willful and malicious injury\\" to them. Seligmann's attorney, noted Triangle lawyer David Rudolf, said that the players intend to pursue such a claim. According to at least one bankruptcy law expert, Nifong's bankruptcy filing is a tacit admission that he does not have the resources to defend himself against the players' civil suit, and is trying to protect what assets he is allowed to protect under the law. On March 11, 2008, the Bankruptcy Administrator recommended that Nifong's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case because Nifong earned income above the requirement set forth in the Means Test to be eligible to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. However, the Bankruptcy Court ultimately held that Nifong was eligible to be a debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and granted him a bankruptcy discharge on June 4, 2008. Later that same year, Judge William L. Stocks lifted the automatic stay imposed by Nifong's bankruptcy filing, and announced that the plaintiffs can pursue their lawsuit. Later developments In July 2014 there was a call for all the cases Nifong had prosecuted to be reviewed on the basis of his having been shown to ignore due process in some cases including the murder trial against Darryl Howard, who had been convicted in 1995 of a 1991 murder of a woman and her daughter.\\"N.C. judge overturns Darryl Howard conviction, finds prosecutor misconduct by Mike Nifong\\" , The Washington Post, May 27, 2014; accessed May 2, 2016. In 2014, Darryl Howard, who at that time had been imprisoned for murder for 20 years, was granted a new trial because Nifong had withheld evidence in the trial that led to his convictions. Two years later, following a hearing where the state was asked why the convictions should stand, the murder conviction was vacated and Howard released from prison, noting that DNA evidence not presented to the jury would likely have exonerated him.

Capital Its capital was at first in Birgi, and later in Ayasoluk (present day Sel√ßuk), was one of the frontier principalities established in the 14th century by Oghuz Turks after the decline of Sultanate of R√ªm. History The Aydinids also held parts of the port of Smyrna (modern ƒ∞zmir) all through their rule and all of the port city with intervals. Especially during the reign of Umur Bey, the sons of Aydƒ±n were a significant naval power of the time. The naval power of Aydin played a crucial role in the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì1347, where Umur allied with John VI Kantakouzenos, but also provoked a Latin response in the form of the Smyrniote crusades, that captured Smyrna from the beylik. The Beylik was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire for the first time in 1390, and after the passage of Tamerlane in Anatolia in 1402 and the ensuing period of troubles that lasted until 1425, its territories became again part of the Ottoman realm, this time definitively.

Its effective radiated power is 11,500 watts and is owned by Mid-West Family Broadcasting. History The station went on the air in 1967 as 3,000-watt WTIM-FM, playing beautiful music and featuring local high school sports events as an extension of WTIM (AM 1410, now WIHM) which was a daytimer. From 1975 to 1983, the station was WEEE (known as \\"Triple E\\" and later \\"W-3-E\\") with a variety of contemporary music formats, starting as adult contemporary then changing to \\"Rock 'n' Gold\\" (an AC/oldies hybrid) and then to album oriented rock. As an AOR station, the station first began to attract an audience in the Springfield market and was drawing much of its advertising revenue from there. WEEE was sold in 1984 and the new owners changed the format to country music as WTJY. The station was sold again two years later and the format became satellite-fed AC. In 1990, WTJY took on a dayparted format with AAA/Rock mix during the day and a hard-rock/Heavy Metal mix at night. The station also featured the \\"Todd & Joe morning show\\" with Todd Ellis and Joe Swank, both of whom went on to work at WKCM/WLME in Hawesville, KY/Tell City, Indiana after the station sale in 1993. The station also featured Rick Elliott music director and afternoon host, later left to become Operations Manager of WJVO/WJIL in Jacksonville, IL, and Shawn Balint, who went by the handle of \\"Doc Rock\\". Ownership of WTIM and WTJY became separate in 1993 (thanks to deregulation making it possible for Springfield \\"clusters\\" to add a station), with WTJY going to Mid-West Family Broadcast Group to become part of the company's Springfield station cluster as WQLZ. The station also was granted a power increase to 11,500 watts and a tower relocation into Sangamon County to get city-grade coverage of Springfield without relinquishing city-grade coverage of Taylorville. Ellis was on the new WQLZ for a time and Balint remained with WTIM. Meanwhile, WTIM later gained a new FM sister to serve Taylorville in 94.3 WMKR, and moved to its current frequency of 97.3 in 1996 while a Catholic religious broadcaster took over the AM 1410 signal. During the 1990s, WQLZ was the only radio station in the Central Illinois area with live DJs 24 hours a day, featuring \\"Ray Lytle's Morning Disaster\\" hosted by Ray Lytle with his brother Bodine, as well as Jim the Photographer, Mikey, Shawn Balint (who returned to the frequency sometime in the decade), Rocky, Mychelle the Weather Babe, Brando and Rich, Marvin, Larz, and others. In 2006, Balint went on to the St. Louis market, Mikey left radio, and in November 2007, Jim the Photographer died in his home.Obituary On August 24, 2015, WQLZ began temporarily simulcasting on WLCE, which became the new home for WQLZ on September 4. On that day, 92.7 began stunting with TV theme songs as \\"TV 93\\" and changed its call sign to WUSW-FM. On the 8th, 92.7 flipped to country as \\"92.7 US Country\\". The call sign WUSW was briefly moved to 1670 AM in Madison, WI, until WUSW-FM assumed the call sign on the 22nd.Alice Doesn‚Äôt Live In Springfield Anymore As WQLZ Moves To 97.7 On August 28, 2020, it was announced by Midwest Family that WUSW would drop their country format and begin simulcasting WMAY on September 1.

In Arden's introductory note to the text, he describes it as \\"a realistic, but not a naturalistic\\" play. Four songs are performed that Arden writes should be sung not to an original score but to \\"folk-song airs.\\" Music for this production was composed by Dudley Moore. It was the first public performance of his own original compositions.  Plot  The work follows three privates in the British Army and their sergeant, all of whom are deserters from a foreign imperialist war. Serjeant Musgrave and his men, Hurst, Sparky and Attercliffe, come to a northern English coal mining town in 1879, posing as a recruiting party. The community is in the grip of a coal strike and cut off by winter snow. The one means of reaching the town is by canal barge. They arrive in the company of the Bargee, a foul-mouthed, disrespectful individual who teases and abuses everyone, especially those in authority. In the local inn the soldiers meet Mrs Hitchcock, who runs the inn, and the barmaid Annie. The soldiers are greeted by the mayor, parson and constable, who ask them to recruit men in hopes of alleviating some of the town's unemployment as a way to rid the town of their economic dead weight. Musgrave pretends that this is indeed his goal, and asks Mrs Hitchcock about Billy Hicks, a dead fellow soldier from the mining town. It is revealed that Billy was the father of Annie's illegitimate child, but the baby died, and Annie's sanity has suffered from the loss of both Billy and her child. That night in the churchyard, the soldiers talk among themselves and reveal their real purpose: appalled by a violent incident where five innocent men were killed, to avenge the death of a single soldier, they have come to the town to convince the people that the colonial war and the violence used are wrong. The single soldier was Billy Hicks, and the reason they chose this particular town, where he was born. Continuing the pretence of recruiting townsmen, Musgrave throws a sort of party in Mrs Hitchcock's inn, with free drink for all. Private Sparky tries to impress Annie, but she prefers the handsome Hurst and promises to come to him that night. However, he later rejects her, and she goes to Sparky. They agree to run away together, but are overheard by Hurst, who tries to stop them. In the following struggle, Sparky is accidentally killed by falling on a bayonet, held by the pacifist Attercliffe. Serjeant Musgrave rushes in and they hide the body, when they are told that the colliers are stealing the soldiers' guns. The mayor arrives to say that the town is no longer cut off by snow and the dragoons have been called for. Musgrave announces he will hold a recruiting meeting the next morning. Instead of recruiting townsmen, Musgrave takes out a Gatling gun. The gun is loaded and pointed at the audience. Then the soldiers hoist up the skeleton of Billy Hicks on a lamppost, still dressed in uniform. Musgrave dances below it reciting a rhyme: > ... Up he goes, and no-one knows, who it was that raised him. ... He sits on > your back and you'll never, never lose him.... Musgrave talks about the atrocities that followed the soldier's death, and explains that since this single death caused five on the other side, five times five townsfolk should be killed to avenge their deaths. Attercliffe refuses to take part in any more violence, but Hurst is quite ready to shoot. Annie intervenes and tells everyone of Sparky's death, producing his bloody tunic as evidence. Hurst makes one last desperate attempt to shoot into the crowd but is overpowered by Musgrave and Attercliffe. The dragoons arrive, shoot Hurst and imprison the two remaining soldiers, who will be hanged later.The Officer of Dragoons addresses Musgrave by number, rank and name: \\"22128480 Serjeant Musgrave, J.\\" The number apparently had some significance for Arden as he used it in other scripts. Ever the jester, the Bargee leads the townsfolk in singing \\"Michael Finnegan\\" as a way of \\"beginning again\\". In the final scene, Attercliffe and Musgrave sit in their cell and talk about their differing views of life. Musgrave has always lived by rules, regulations and honour. Attercliffe tells how he lost his wife to a greengrocer, who looked like \\"a rat grinning through a brush\\", but was a better man because he fed people, as he fed Attercliffe's ex-wife, which Attercliffe himself could not do. In the end, Attercliffe seems to say, it is everyday life that matters, not ideals.  Characters  * Serjeant \\"Black Jack\\" Musgrave is a lifetime soldier, a man who believes in strict adherence to the rule book. His faith in order was destroyed by the atrocities in the colonies, and he wants to serve justice, by the book, on those who sent him there. * Private Attercliffe is an older soldier, broken in spirit by the events he witnessed and in which he participated, killing a young girl. * Private Hurst is a brute, who is happy to kill if necessary, and is following Musgrave to work out his aggression on new victims. He is also a womaniser, and is the first one of the soldiers Annie attaches herself to. * Private Sparky is the youngest, more of a joker, and is less committed to Musgrave's mission than the others. * Annie, apparently a barmaid at Mrs. Hitchcock's inn, may also be the house prostitute. It is never clear if her attentions to the soldiers are motivated by romance or other considerations. * Mrs Hitchcock, something of a Mother Courage figure, is a survivor. As long as she can keep serving food and ale, and gets paid for it, she can go on. She develops as a kind of anti- Musgrave. As she says, commenting on Musgrave's rejection of \\"life and love\\" for his rules, because life and love leads to chaos: \\"We had life and love. You came in with yer rules and honour. It's arsy-versy to what you said, but its still chaos in the end, isn't it?\\" * The Mayor, also the owner of the pit. Although in charge of the town, he is actually trapped by the realities of his business. He cannot yield to the strikers. * The Parson, a Church authority figure, cold and aloof, who (as in many British dramas) also represents the religious side of state authority. He even uses the metaphor of a sword in a speech to the townspeople. * The Constable, nominally the arm of the law, actually in the pay of the Mayor, and unable to exert real authority. He encourages Musgrave to \\"recruit\\" the town's troublemakers, using the method of getting them drunk and carrying them off to the barracks. * The colliers, three men of different demeanours, named simply \\"Slow Collier\\", \\"Earnest Collier\\", and \\"Pugnacious Collier\\", who represent the townspeople in the play. They also play out their own internal rivalries, as when the Slow Collier drunkenly recites a rhyme suggesting he had sex with the wife of the Pugnacious Collier, resulting in a brawl. * Bludgeon, the Bargee, something of a jester in the play, but also able to drive the action by saying what others cannot. At times he acts almost like a master of ceremonies, or a Brechtian narrator. * The Officer of Dragoons, in the playwright's own words a deus ex machina who sets the world to rights. He arrives with arrest warrants for the soldiers, two of whom are already dead, and bids the Mayor and townsfolk to carry on with their lives. * A Trooper of Dragoons who shoots Hurst and then holds the other soldiers at gunpoint for the Officer.  Meaning  Arden writes of the meaning of the play: \\"I think that many of us must at some time have felt an overpowering urge to match some particularly outrageous piece of violence with an even greater and more outrageous retaliation. Musgrave tries to do this: and the fact that the sympathies of the play are clearly with him in his original horror, and then turn against him and his intended remedy, seems to have bewildered people... Again I would suggest that an unwillingness to dwell upon unpleasant situations that do not immediately concern us is a general human trait, and recognition of it need imply neither cynicism nor despair. Complete pacifism is a very hard doctrine: and if this play appears to advocate it with perhaps some timidity, it is probably because I am naturally a timid man -- and also because I know that if I am hit I very easily hit back: and I do not care to preach too confidently what I am not sure I can practise.\\" Reception The play did poorly in its first run and the production lost money. Most critical reviews of the first production were deprecating or at least showed a lack of understanding of the play's message.Arden, John. Serjeant Musgrave's Dance. (Methuen Student Edition). London: Methuen, 1982; p. xxxii At the time the play was written, public opinion had not soured on military actions as it did later in the 1960s, primarily due to the coverage of the Vietnam War. The only contemporary British military actions comparable to the colonial conflicts were the Malayan Emergency, and the Mau Mau Uprising. It was only later, in the light of the Vietnam War, that these conflicts also were reported unfavourably, producing a context in which audiences could appreciate Arden's message.

They rely on mental health assessments, individualized treatment plans, and ongoing judicial monitoring to address both the mental health needs of offenders and public safety concerns of communities. Like other problem-solving courts such as drug courts, domestic violence courts, and community courts, mental health courts seek to address the underlying problems that contribute to criminal behavior.There is a growing body of literature about problem-solving courts. For an explanation of the six key principles underlying problem-solving courts, see Mental health courts share characteristics with crisis intervention teams, jail diversion programs, specialized probation and parole caseloads, and a host of other collaborative initiatives intended to address the significant overrepresentation of people with mental illness in the criminal justice system.The U.S. Department of Justice reports that 16 percent of inmates in the U.S. reported either a mental condition or an overnight stay in a mental hospital, and were identified as mentally ill. See History In the United States in the early 1980s, Judge Evan Dee Goodman helped establish a court exclusively to deal with mental health matters at Wishard Memorial Hospital. The mentally ill were frequently arrested and had charges pending when the treatment providers sought a civil commitment to send their patient for long- term psychiatric treatment. Judge Goodman's court at Wishard Hospital could serve both purposes. The probate part of the mental health court would handle the civil commitment. The criminal docket of the mental health court could handled the arrest charges. The criminal charges could be put on diversion, or hold, allowing the patient's release from jail custody. The civil commitment would then become effective and the patient could be sent to a state hospital for treatment. Judge Goodman would schedule periodic hearings to learn of the patient's progress. If warranted, the criminal charges were dismissed, but the patient still had obligations to the civil commitment. In addition to arranging inpatient treatment, Judge Goodman often put defendants on diversion, or on an outpatient commitment, and ordered them into outpatient treatment. Judge Goodman would have periodic hearings to determine the patient's compliance with the treatment plan. Patients who did not follow the treatment plan faced sanctions, a modification of the plan, or if they were on diversion their original charge could be set for trial. Judge Goodman's concept and the original mental health court were dissolved in the early 1990s. In 1995, Judge Goodman was reprimanded for nepotism.Matter of Goodman , 649 N.E.2d 115 (1995), No. 49S00-9406-JD-581, Supreme Court of Indiana, April 27, 1995 In the mid-1990s, many of the professional mental health workers who had worked with Judge Goodman sought to re-establish a mental health court in Indianapolis. Representatives of the county's mental health service providers and other stake holders began meeting weekly. The group decided to accept the name of the PAIR Program (PAIR stood for Psychiatric Assertive Identification and Referral). After, a couple years of lobbying the local authorities in Marion County, Indiana, the mental health court began as a formal program in 1996. Many consider this to be the nation's first mental health court in this second wave of mental health court initiatives. Since the PAIR Program did not operate with any new funds, there was not much scholarly research and therefore the accomplishments of Judge Goodman and the PAIR Program are frequently overlooked. The current PAIR Program is a comprehensive pretrial, post-booking diversion system for mentally ill offenders. A program launched in Broward County, Florida was the first court, to be recognized and published as a specialized mental health court. Overseen by Judge Ginger Lerner-Wren, the Broward County Mental Health Court was launched in 1997, partially in response to a series of suicides of people with mental illness in the county jail. The Broward court and three other early mental health courts, Anchorage, AK, San Bernardino, CA, and King County, WA, were examined in a 2000 Bureau of Justice Assistance monograph, which was the first major study of this emerging judicial strategy. Shortly after the establishment of the Broward County Mental Health Court, other mental health courts began to open in jurisdictions around the U.S., launched by practitioners who believed that standard punishments were ineffective when applied to the mentally ill.For an overview of the factors contributing to the development of mental health courts see In Alaska, for example, the state's first mental health court (established in Anchorage in 1998) was spearheaded by Judge Stephanie Rhoades, who felt probation alone was inadequate. \\"I started seeing a lot of people in criminal misdemeanors who were cycling through the system and who simply did not understand their probation conditions or what they were doing in jail. I saw police arresting people in order to get them help. I felt there had to be a better solution,\\" she explained in an interview. Mental health courts were also inspired by the movement to develop other problem-solving courts, such as drug courts, domestic violence courts, community courts and parole reentry courts. The overarching motivation behind the development of these courts was rising caseloads and increasing frustration‚Äîboth among the public and among system players‚Äîwith the standard approach to case processing and case outcomes in state courts.. In February 2001, the first juvenile mental health court opened in Santa Clara, California. Since 2000, the number of mental health courts has expanded rapidly. There are an estimated 150 courts in the U.S. and dozens more are being planned.See page vii of An ongoing survey conducted by several organizations identified more than 120 mental health courts across the country as of 2006. The proliferation of courts was spurred in large part by the federal Mental Health Courts Program administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which provided funding to 37 courts in 2002 and 2003. In England, UK, two pilot mental health courts was launched in 2009 in response to a review of people with mental health problems in the criminal justice system. They were considered a success which met needs that would have otherwise gone unmet; however they required financial support and wider changes to the system, and it is not clear whether they will be more broadly implemented. Definition Mental health courts vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but most share a number of characteristics. The Council of State Governments Justice Center has defined the \\"essential elements\\" of mental health courts. The CSG Justice Center, in a publication detailing the essential elements, notes that the majority of mental health courts share the following characteristics: * A specialized court docket, which employs a problem-solving approach to court processing in lieu of more traditional court procedures for certain defendants with mental illness. * Judicially supervised, community- based treatment plans for each defendant participating in the court, which a team of court staff and mental health professionals design and implement. * Regular status hearings at which treatment plans and other conditions are periodically reviewed for appropriateness, incentives are offered to reward adherence to court conditions, and sanctions are imposed on participants who do not adhere to the conditions of participation. * Criteria defining a participant's completion of (sometimes called graduation from) the program. Court process Potential participants in a mental health court are usually screened early on in the criminal process, either at the jail or by court staff such as pretrial services officers or social workers in the public defender's office. Most courts have criteria related to what kind of charges, criminal histories, and diagnoses will be accepted. For example, a court may accept only defendants charged with misdemeanors, who have no history of violent crimes, and who have an Axis I diagnoses as defined by the DSM-IV. Defendants who fit the criteria based on the initial screening are usually given a more comprehensive assessment to determine their interest in participating and their community treatment needs. Defendants who agree to participate receive a treatment plan and other community supervision conditions. For those who adhere to their treatment plan for the agreed upon time, usually between six months and two years, their cases are either dismissed or the sentence is greatly reduced. If the defendant does not comply with the conditions of the court, or decides to leave the program, their case returns to the original criminal calendar where the prosecution proceeds as normal. As a rule, most mental health courts use a variety of intermediate sanctions in response to noncompliance before ending a defendant's participation. An essential component of mental health court programs for protection of the public is a dynamic risk management process that involves court supervised case management with interactive court review and assessment. As in other problem-solving courts, the judge in a mental health court plays a larger role than a judge in a conventional court. Problem-solving courts rely upon the active use of judicial authority to solve problems and to change the behavior of litigants. For instance, in a problem-solving court, the same judge presides at every hearing. The rationale behind this is not only to ensure that the presiding judge is trained in pertinent concepts, such as mental illness, drug addiction, or domestic violence, but also to foster an ongoing relationship between the judge and participants.‚ÄúInstead of passing off cases ‚Äî to other judges, to probation departments, to community-based treatment programs ‚Äî judges at problem-solving courts stay involved with each case throughout the post-adjudication process. Drug court judges, for example, closely supervise the performance of offenders in drug treatment, requiring them to return to court frequently for urine testing and courtroom progress reports.‚Äù From . In addition, for a detailed description of the role of the judge in a problem-solving court, see Chapter 4 in . Although the judge has final say over a case, mental health courts also take a team approach in which the defense counsel, prosecutor, case managers, treatment professionals, and community supervision personnel (for example, probation) work collaboratively to, for example, craft systems of sanctions and rewards for offenders in drug treatment. Many mental health courts also employ a full-time coordinator who manages the docket and facilitates communication between the different team members. Criticisms Some have criticized mental health courts for deepening, as opposed to lessening, the involvement of people with mental illness in the criminal justice system. They argued that this was particularly true in mental health courts that focus on misdemeanor offenders who would have received short jail sentences or probation if not for the mental health court. These critics urged mental health courts to accept defendants charged with felonies, which many of the more recent courts, such as the Brooklyn Mental Health Court, have started to do.For a comprehensive analysis of the Brooklyn Mental Health Court, see Critics have also raised concerns about the use of mental health courts to coerce people into treatment, the requirement in some courts that defendants enter a guilty plea prior to entering the court, and about infringement on the privacy of treatment information. Furthermore, many have noted that the rise of mental health courts is, in large part, the result of an underfunded and ineffective community mental health system, and without attention to the deficiencies in community treatment resources, mental health courts can only have a limited impact.See http://www.courtinnovation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&pageID;=660&nodeID;=1 for a summary of a roundtable discussion in which statewide coordinators of problem-solving courts noted a lack of resources can undermine the work of a problem-solving court. Finally, it has been noted that when scarce mental health services are redirected to those who have come in contact with the criminal justice system, it creates a perversion in the system were a person's best bet for obtaining services is to get arrested. Outcomes Several studies of the Broward County court were released in 2002 and 2003 and found that participation in the court led to a greater connection to services. A 2004 study of the Santa Barbara County, California, Mental Health Court found that participants had reduced criminal activity during their participation. An evaluation of the Brooklyn Mental Health Court documented improvements in several outcome measures, including substance abuse, psychiatric hospitalizations, homelessness and recidivism. In a 2011 meta-analysis of literature on the effectiveness of mental health courts in the United States, it was found that mental health courts reduced recidivism by an overall effect size of ‚àí0.54.Sarteschi, C, Vaughn, M and Kim, K 'Assessing the Effectiveness of Mental Health Courts: A Quantitative Review' (2011) 39 Journal of Criminal Justice 12 In 2012, an Urban Institute evaluation found that participants in two New York City mental health courts were significantly less likely to re- offend than similar offenders whose cases are handled in the traditional court system. A review published in 2019 concerned with drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental health problems found that mental health courts may help people reduce future drug use and criminal activity.

It is also a human right explicitly mentioned and protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, the Constitution of Canada, the Constitution of South Africa and other laws around the world. In general, the right to the security of one's person is associated with liberty and includes the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to a remedy such as habeas corpus.Rhona K.M. Smith, Textbook on International Human Rights, second edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 240. Security of person can also be seen as an expansion of rights based on prohibitions of torture and cruel and unusual punishment. Rights to security of person can guard against less lethal conduct, and can be used in regard to prisoners' rights.Smith, p. 245. United Nations The right to security of the person is guaranteed by Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In this article, it is combined with the right to life and liberty. In full, the article reads, \\"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.\\" The United Nations treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), also recognizes a right to security of person. Article 3 states that \\"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person,\\" and the section prohibits \\"arbitrary arrest or detention.\\" The section continues, \\"No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.\\"  Europe  The right to security of the person is mentioned in Article 5(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights under the heading Right to liberty and security (\\"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\\") and in Article 6 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\\"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person\\"). Canada The right to security of the person was recognized in Canada in the Canadian Bill of Rights in 1960. Section 1(a) of this law recognized \\"the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law.\\" However, the Bill of Rights was a statute and not part of the Constitution. In 1982, a right to security of the person was added to the Constitution. It was included in section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which stipulates that \\"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\\" Security of the person in section 7 consists of rights to privacy of the body and its healthHogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, 981. and of the right protecting the \\"psychological integrity\\" of an individual. That is, the right protects against significant government-inflicted harm (stress) to the mental state of the individual. (Blencoe v. B.C. (Human Rights Commission), 2000) This right has generated significant case law, as abortion in Canada was legalized in R. v. Morgentaler (1988) after the Supreme Court found the Therapeutic Abortion Committees breached women's security of person by threatening their health. Some judges also felt control of the body was a right within security of the person, breached by the abortion law. In Operation Dismantle v. The Queen (1985) cruise missile testing was unsuccessfully challenged as violating security of the person for risking nuclear war. In Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General) (2005), some Supreme Court justices even considered Quebec's ban on private health care to breach security of the person, since delays in medical treatment could have physical and stressful consequences. There has been discussion within the Supreme Court and among academics as to whether security of the person also guarantees some economic rights. Theoretically, security of the person would be breached if the government limits a person's ability to make an income, by denying welfare, taking away property essential to one's profession, or denying licenses. However, section 7 is primarily concerned with legal rights, so this reading of economic rights is questionable. Many economic issues could also be political questions.Hogg, 983. South Africa In 1996 the government of South Africa adopted a constitutional Bill of Rights which recognized a right to security of the person in section 12. Here, it was combined with a \\"right to freedom.\\" Section 12 went on to define security of the person and the right to freedom more thoroughly, including within it bodily control and reproductive control, freedom from torture and cruel and unusual punishment and a right to trial. In full, section 12 reads, Turkey The Constitution of Turkey guarantees security of person, along with the right to liberty, in Article 19, enacted in 1982 and amended in 2001. The article spells out limits to these rights in the form of rulings of courts under the law, allowing for mental institutions and institutions for addicts, extradition, etc. The article also limits arrest and detention to cases in which a judge allows it, where there is not enough time for this, or the person is seen being responsible for a crime. A person will then be told why they have been arrested, and their next of kin will also be told of the arrest. Finally, the article allows for government compensation if these rights are violated. New Zealand The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, adopted in 1990, guarantees \\"Life and security of the person\\" in sections 8 through 11. Section 8 guarantees a right to life except when deprived in accordance with fundamental justice, while section 9 prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Section 10 prohibits a person being subjected to medical treatment against his or her will. Finally, section 11 gives a New Zealander the right to not take medical treatment. United Kingdom Security of person is mentioned in Schedule I Article 5 of the Human Rights Act 1998. This version is the latest incarnation of the Act, though there have been minor edits since. This new act represents one aspect of Tony Blair's \\"Constitutional Reform\\".

He was killed by enemy sniper fire three days later. Early years Dale Hansen was born in Wisner, Nebraska. While attending the schools of Cuming County, he helped out on the family farm, and after graduating from high school in Wisner in 1940, he worked full-time on the farm. Marine Corps service Hansen was inducted into the Marine Corps Reserve on 11 May 1944. He completed recruit training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California, and was then assigned to the Infantry Training Battalion at Camp Pendleton, California, where he underwent four weeks of infantry indoctrination and two weeks of training with the Browning Automatic Rifle. With that weapon he turned in a score of 175 to become an Expert Automatic Rifleman. Private Hansen sailed for the Pacific theater on 12 November 1944, with a replacement draft, and the following month, joined Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, at Pavuvu in the Russell Islands. There, he underwent \\"bazooka\\" training before sailing with the 1st Marine Division for maneuvers at Banika Island and Guadalcanal in February 1945. Late that March, after a few more days back at Pavuvu, the division left for Okinawa where Pvt Hansen landed with his unit on Easter Sunday, 1 April 1945. The action which brought him the Medal of Honor occurred in the battle for Hill 60 on the southern part of the island where his determination and total disregard of personal danger helped his unit take a well-defended enemy position. Pvt Hansen was killed by a Japanese sniper on 11 May 1945 in the Wana-Dakeshi Ridge fighting. The Medal of Honor was presented to Hansen's parents on 30 May 1946, by the officer in charge of the Midwestern Recruiting Division as part of Wisner's Memorial Day observance. Private Hansen was initially buried in the 1st Marine Division Cemetery on Okinawa, but his remains were returned to the United States in 1948 for burial in Wisner Cemetery in Wisner, Nebraska. Medal of Honor citation The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to PRIVATE DALE M. HANSEN UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE for service as set forth in the following CITATION: :For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with Company E, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa Shima in the Ry≈´ky≈´ Chain, 7 May 1945. Cool and courageous in combat, Private Hansen unhesitatingly took the initiative during a critical stage of the action and, armed with a rocket launcher, crawled to an exposed position where he attacked and destroyed a strategically located hostile pillbox. With his weapon subsequently destroyed by enemy fire, he seized a rifle and continued his one-man assault. Reaching the crest of a ridge, he leaped across, opened fire on six Japanese and killed four before his rifle jammed. Attacked by the remaining two Japanese, he beat them off with the butt of his rifle and then climbed back to cover. Promptly returning with another weapon and a supply of grenades, he fearlessly advanced, destroyed a strong mortar position and annihilated eight more of the enemy. In the forefront of battle throughout this bitterly waged engagement, Private Hansen, by his indomitable determination, bold tactics and complete disregard of all personal danger, contributed essentially to the success of his company's mission and to the ultimate capture of this fiercely defended outpost of the Japanese Empire. His great personal valor in the face of extreme peril reflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service. /S/ HARRY S.

Michel Langevin computed a value of exp exp exp exp 730 for the bound. Tijdeman's theorem provided a strong impetus towards the eventual proof of Catalan's conjecture by Preda MihƒÉilescu.

Great Mosque of Manisa, built 1374. The Sarukhanids or Sarukhanid dynasty (Modern Turkish: Saruhanoƒüullarƒ±, Saruhanoƒüullarƒ± Beyliƒüi), also known as the Principality of Saruhan and Beylik of Saruhan (Saruhan Beyliƒüi), was one of the Anatolian beyliks, centered in Manisa. It was one of the frontier principalities established by Oghuz Turkish clans after the decline of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate. It was founded by the tribal chief Saruhan about 1300 and lasted for a first time until 1390, when Bayezid I overran the region and finally until 1412, when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed I killed Hƒ±zƒ±r, the last Saruhan ruler, and absorbed the Beylik into the Ottoman Empire as a province. History The founder of the beylik, Sarukhan Bey, began his military career as an emir of the Germiyanids. Sometime at the beginning of the 14th century, he seized territories for himself in the Gediz River (Hermus under its previous Byzantine rulers) valley and founded a dynasty that started to rule the region from its base in Manisa. Its principal towns included Menemen, G√∂rdes, Demirci, Nif, and Kasaba. Legacies The dynasty's period as a regional power is largely limited to the long reign of its founder, Sarukhan Bey (d. 1346), under whom the principality became a naval power in the Aegean Sea, and regularly battled with the fleets of the Republic of Genoa and the Dukes of Naxos. The most enduring monument of the Sarukhan dynasty is the Great Mosque at Manisa. Constructed in 1374 by ƒ∞shak Bey, the mosque has a prayer hall covered by a dome 14m in diameter. Attached to the prayer hall is an innovative, semi-covered forecourt. The building likely served as inspiration for the √ú√ß ≈ûerefeli Mosque, constructed some sixty years later by the Ottoman sultan Murad II. The region roughly corresponding to the area of extension of Sarukhan dynasty's administration became an Ottoman sub-province (sanjak) under the continued name of Sarukhan until the early years of the Republic of Turkey.

Saunders pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Arizona Diamondbacks, Baltimore Orioles, Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. College and minor league career Saunders played college baseball at Virginia Tech, where he compiled a 27‚Äì7 career record. His 27 wins tie him for third place in most career wins in school history. His accomplishments as a Hokie earned him a place in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame. In 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was drafted in the first round (12th overall) by the then Anaheim Angels in . After being promoted to Single-A Cedar Rapids in 2002, he missed the entire season due to an injury in his left shoulder. He returned to the game with Single-A Rancho Cucamonga in and went 9-7 with a 3.41 ERA. He was promoted to Double-A Arkansas in 2004 and recorded a 7-4 record with two complete games in . Later in 2005, he was promoted to Triple-A Salt Lake. In 2005, he was a combined 10-7 with three complete games, including two shutouts, earning honors as the Angels Organization's Pitcher of the Year. He was named #37 of the top 50 minor league baseball players in 2006 by Minor League News. Major league career =Los Angeles Angels= Saunders with the Angels in 2009 Saunders made his major league debut on August 16, 2005 against the Toronto Blue Jays, receiving a no decision after closer Francisco Rodr√≠guez blew the save in a 4-3 loss for the Angels. He was sent back down to Salt Lake, but recalled on September 6 to start against the Seattle Mariners on September 14. Once again, he received a no-decision in a 10-9 defeat and was optioned to Salt Lake. Though he was not placed on the playoff roster, he was re-signed by the Angels to a one-year contract. After Bartolo Col√≥n was placed on the disabled list during the season, Saunders was recalled a final time and replaced Colon in the rotation. Before Saunders received his first loss, he compiled a 4-0 record. He ended the season with a 7-3 record and a 4.71 ERA. Saunders began the season in the rotation while Colon remained on the disabled list. As the only active major league player at the time from Virginia Tech, Saunders received special permission to wear a Virginia Tech cap during the April 20, 2007, game against the Seattle Mariners to honor the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre. He also wore the initials \\"VT\\" on his cleats and drew the Virginia Tech logo on the back of the pitcher's mound before the start of the game. He picked up the win after pitching six shutout innings. He was optioned to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees on April 21, 2007, to make room for Colon's return. Saunders made two spot starts for when a pitcher on the Angel's normal rotation was injured: for Colon (triceps tendinitis) on June 2, 2007, against the Baltimore Orioles and for Jered Weaver (bruised shoulder) on June 22, 2007, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was called up for a third time on July 21, 2007, to replace Ervin Santana in the starting rotation when Santana was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake. In , Saunders entered spring training in a competition with Santana for the role of 5th starter in the Angels rotation. After the Angels' co-aces John Lackey and Kelvim Escobar sustained injuries, both Saunders and Santana were promoted to full-time roles as the 3rd and 4th starter, respectively. In the first third of the season, both players shone brightly, with both being considered early candidates for the American League Cy Young Award. On June 3, 2008, Saunders became the American League's first 9-game winner in a 5-4 victory over division rivals the Seattle Mariners. Saunders gave up only one earned run, lowering his ERA to 3rd best in the American League in the process. Saunders also then became the first American League pitcher to get 11 wins, giving up only two earned runs to the Philadelphia Phillies on June 21, 2008. Following the 2008 season, Saunders was asked to join the USA Baseball team for the 2009 World Baseball Classic. However, he declined the request. Saunders was the opening day pitcher for the Angels in the 2009 season. On May 9, 2009, he pitched his first major league complete game shutout against the Kansas City Royals. From 2008‚Äì2009, Saunders compiled 33 wins. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On July 25, 2010, he was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Dan Haren.

On December 12, 2011, Saunders was non- tendered and became a free agent. On January 17, 2012, he re-signed with the Diamondbacks for one year at a salary of $6 million. =Baltimore Orioles= Joe Saunders in 2012. On August 26, 2012, Saunders was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Matt Lindstrom. He finished 3-3 in seven starts for the O's. Saunders was the winning pitcher when the Orioles defeated the Texas Rangers in the inaugural Wild Card Game, pitching innings with four strikeouts. =Seattle Mariners= Saunders with the Mariners On February 12, 2013, Saunders agreed to a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners. Over his first six weeks of the season, he pitched very well at home in Safeco Field and extremely poorly in his road outings. This pattern coupled with previous good numbers at Safeco Field earned him the slightly-pejorative sobriquet \\"Safeco Joe.\\" Although he pitched slightly better at home than on the road, his home ERA was at 4.99 in 13 starts, while on the road his ERA was 5.45 in 19 starts. Saunders finished with a record of 11-16 and a 5.26 ERA for the M's. =Texas Rangers= On March 4, 2014, Saunders signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers.

The couple has three daughters. He described himself in an interview, \\"My personality is laid back and very low key. I like to have fun, and I like to hang out and be with family and friends. Then, once I get on the field, everything changes. I don‚Äôt think about any family, any friends, any babies, or anyone at all. Once I‚Äôm out there on that mound, I‚Äôm all business.

The work can be dated at the end of 3rd century CE. The provenience is usually regarded as Egypt, or perhaps Syria. The author is unknown. This text served as a law-code for the Coptic, Ethiopian Orthodox and other Oriental Orthodox churches. It superseded in authority and esteem the Didache, under which name it sometimes went. Manuscript Tradition The full and original text, in Greek, was found in a 12th-century manuscript discovered in 1843 at Vienna and publishedGeschichte des Kirchenrechts, Giessen, 1843, I, 107-132. in the same year by Johann Wilhelm Bickell,Johann Wilhelm Bickell was professor of canon law at the University of Marburg, and died (1848) as minister of justice of Hesse-Kassel. He was the father of Gustav Bickell. which named it Apostolische Kirchenordnung. Only other four fragmentary Greek manuscripts are extant. A complete Syriac ancient translation, with English translation, was published in 1901 by John Peter Arendzen.Journal of Theol. Studies, October 1901. The Ge'ez version was first published in 1691 by Hiob Ludolf.In the \\"Commentarius\\" to his \\"Historia Ethiopica\\" (Frankfort 1691). The Apostolic Church-Ordinance usually is found also in ancient collections of Church Orders. It is the second book in the Verona Palimpsest, it is the first book in the Alexandrine Sinodos and in the Bohairic version of the Clementine Octateuch, while the Arabic version of the Clementine Octateuch has it in the second place, and the Syriac version of it has it in the third place. Thus we have many early translations of the Apostolic Church-Ordinance in Latin, Ge'ez, Bohairic Coptic, Sahidic Coptic, Arabic and Syriac. For the publication details of these versions, see articles about the relevant collections. The titles found on the manuscripts can be different, so the Bohairic Alexandrine Sinodos version is entitled \\"Canons of our Fathers the Holy Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, which they appointed in the Churches\\", while the Syriac version has \\"Third book of Clement, Teaching of the twelve Apostles\\". Content As usual in genre of the Church Orders, this texts purports to be the work of the Twelve Apostles, whose instructions, whether given by them as individuals or as a body. In antiquity this text was sometime mistakenly supposed to be gathered and handed down by the Clement of Rome. The names of the Apostles are so listed: John, Matthew, Peter, Andrew, Philip, Simon, James, Nathanael, Thomas, Cephas, Bartholomew and Judas. The presence of both Peter and Cephas, and the first place given to John, is found also in the more ancient Epistula Apostolorum. The content can be so summarized: * chapters 1-3 include a short introduction inspired by the Epistle of Barnabas * chapters 4-14 are an evident adaptation of the first six chapters of the Didache, the moral precepts of which are attributed severally to the Apostles, each of whom, introduced by the formula \\"John says\\", \\"Peter says\\", etc., is represented as framing one or more of the ordinances * chapters 15-30 treat in similar manner of the qualifications for appointment and ordination of bishops, presbyters, reader, deacons and widowers, and this section treats also of the duties of lay male and female and of deacons.

Owned and operated by iHeartMedia, the station airs a sports talk format as an affiliate of Fox Sports Radio. WDAS's studios and offices are located in Bala Cynwyd. WDAS's transmitter is located near Fairmount Park, off West Ford Road.Radio-Locator.com/WDAS-AM By day, the station is powered at 5,000 watts. But to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1480, it reduces power to 1,000 watts at night and uses a directional antenna at all times. WDAS programming is also heard on an FM translator station, 102.5 W273DO in Philadelphia. History =Early Years= WIAD in Ocean City, New Jersey, signed on the air in July 1922, originally broadcasting at 1200 kilocycles. The station was owned by Howard R. Miller. WIAD eventually relocated to Philadelphia. In 1928, per order of the Federal Radio Commission, the station moved to 1370 AM. In 1929, the station's studio and transmitter were moved to the Elks Club at Broad and Vine Streets and the call sign changed to WELK.FCC History cards for WDAS In 1934, Miller sold the station, and the new owners, silk manufacturers Dannenbaum & Steppacher, adopted the WDAS call sign, with the letters spelling out the company's initials. A.W. Dannenbaum served as the station president. The studios were located at 1211 Chestnut Street.Broadcasting Yearbook 1945 page 146 WDAS broadcast ethnic programming in languages such as Italian, Yiddish and Polish. In 1941, WDAS moved to 1400 AM, then about 15 years later to its current frequency of 1480 AM. In 1950, candy manufacturer Max Leon purchased the station for $495,000 from William Goldman, a theater chain owner. The programming at the time consisted of big band music, ethnic and cultural shows. Leon, the founder and conductor of the original Philly Pops Orchestra, added an all-night classical music show. =Switch to R&B;= In 1951, Leon promoted his son-in-law, Bob Klein, to general manager. Klein saw an opportunity in the marketplace and adopted programming geared toward the local African-American community. The music consisted of rhythm & blues and jazz. WDAS added a number of young personalities, including Georgie Woods, Jimmy Bishop, Carl Helm, Butterball Tamburro, Jocko Henderson and Hy Lit. The station also added black-oriented public affairs and news programs, and provided coverage of the unfolding civil rights movement, featuring award-winning and groundbreaking journalists Joe Rainey and Jim Klash, along with Walt Sanders, Carl Stubbs, Bill Adams, Dave Colman, Jimmy Carter and reporter Ed Bradley (later of CBS's 60 Minutes). The station employed many black professionals, in on-air, office and management positions. The station also took on an activist role. WDAS was commended by many in the industry and in the civil rights movement. In 1959, Leon and Klein signed on an FM sister station, 105.3 WDAS-FM. By the early 1970s, the FM station would launch a groundbreaking and influential urban adult contemporary format still heard today. WDAS 1480 retained its R&B; format throughout the 1960s and 70s, while adding gospel music with Louise Williams on Sunday mornings. Many people involved in the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, visited and were heard on the station. Following his return from Mecca, Malcolm X visited the station on December 29, 1964. He was interviewed by Rainey under heavy armed police guard due to assassination threats. Klein filed a class action lawsuit against the Arbitron rating service in 1972, on behalf of all black radio stations, protesting that black radio listenership was undercounted. Arbitron settled the suit after four days of testimony and amended its methodologies and policies to make a better effort to survey African-American listeners and other minorities. =Changes in ownership= Leon sold the station in November 1979 to the minority-owned Unity Broadcasting Network. In the 1980s, WDAS added the National Black Network (NBN) for hourly newscasts, and tried a news format in the mornings, anchored locally by Karen Warrington, E. Steven Collins and Wynne Alexander) and afternoons via the NBN feed. With music listening shifting to FM, 1480 WDAS wanted to compete with all-news 1060 KYW. This was unsuccessful, and the station returned with a mix of gospel, R&B; and talk shows. In 1988, as more listeners were choosing FM urban contemporary stations, WDAS 1480 switched to a full-time gospel music and religious format. Beasley Broadcasting purchased WDAS and WDAS-FM in 1994. Two years later, the stations were sold to Evergreen Media, which soon merged with Chancellor Broadcasting, which later became AMFM Inc. In August 2000, after a series of mergers, the two stations would become properties of Clear Channel Communications. Clear Channel changed its name to iHeartMedia after its successful iHeartRadio internet platform in 2014. =Format changes= On May 16, 2007, WDAS flipped to Spanish Tropical as Rumba 1480, a format and branding displaced by WRFF's flip to modern rock as Radio 104.5. The station's former WUBA calls were also adopted by WDAS. WUBA served as the Spanish language flagship radio station of the Philadelphia Phillies. On November 22, 2011, the station began redirecting existing listeners to 1340 WHAT, after Clear Channel announced that the Rumba format would be replaced by a new urban oldies format the next day as WDAS, The Soul of Philadelphia. The station soft launched with R&B; Christmas music for the holiday season, before officially launching its new format on December 27. =Smooth Jazz JJZ = Logo as Smooth Jazz JJZ. On June 10, 2013, the station flipped to smooth jazz as Smooth Jazz JJZ, reviving a heritage branding that had historically been used by the current WISX from 1993 to 2006, and from November 17, 2006 to September 5, 2008 by the current WPEN-FM. Despite the use of the JJZ brand, the station retained the WDAS calls. From September 19‚Äì27, 2015, the station temporarily branded as Pope Info Radio ‚Äî a \\"pop-up station\\" covering Pope Francis's first visit to the United States, which concluded in Philadelphia. The station interspersed its smooth jazz programming with live coverage of five masses and speeches throughout the visit, and rolling news, traffic, and weather updates relevant to the events. =Breakthrough Radio= Logo as Breakthrough Radio. On September 11, 2017, the station flipped to Breakthrough Radio. The format was a partnership with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, featuring an uptempo variety hits format interspersed with health-related features and public service announcements produced by the Hospital. The JJZ format moved to WISX-HD2. =Fox Sports The Gambler= On August 23, 2019, it was announced that WDAS would flip to a sports talk format as part of the Fox Sports Radio network the following Monday, as Fox Sports The Gambler. The new format launched on August 26, 2019, after the station temporarily stunted with a loop of the NFL on Fox theme music over the weekend. W281BI was not included in the flip due to the existing affiliate WNJE. The station carries local programs geared towards sports betting (taking advantage of the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which had effectively banned sports betting outside of Nevada); it launched with The Daily Tickets‚Äîan afternoon drive program hosted by former WPEN personality Sean Brace. He described The Gambler as the \\"future\\" of sports radio, arguing that the betting-oriented positioning of the station would help distinguish itself from WPEN and the market-leading WIP-FM, and promised that the station would feature \\"no callers\\" and \\"just guests that will bring the best information on the games we love to watch\\". WDAS otherwise carries the full Fox Sports Radio national lineup, including its own betting-related show Straight Outta Vegas. In October 2019, the station added a new evening program hosted by Eytan Shander, What Are The Odds?‚Äîwhich airs on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings. In July 2020, WDAS became the flagship radio station of the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer. HD Radio WDAS formerly broadcast in HD IBOC format.

For 2006, over 100,000 people were expected to attend each day, however, estimates showed that only 45,000 attended over the four days.

It was to be played at a party Seagram threw for its employees acquired as a result of its Universal take-over. It parodies the style of 1950s educational films such as Duck and Cover, while poking fun at Universal and its talent. It was shot in the Universal Studios Lot, and it runs approximately 14 minutes. Upon commissioning the duo to make this film, David Zucker failed to mention that there was no script, so everything was written by Parker and Stone less than an hour before it was shot.Parker and Stone explaining the circumstances The film is notable in that it was Stone and Parker's first Hollywood gig. Parker has said that \\"you could probably make a feature film out of the experience of making that movie because it was just two dudes from college suddenly directing Steven Spielberg.\\" This film has still seen no public release as it was intended to be strictly an internal film (indeed, its creators were not even allowed a copy), but copies of the film have surfaced on the Internet. Ifilm.com had the video on its site for a limited time. The video was promoted on the site in ad banners. These advertisements included the date that ifilm.com would stop hosting the video. Stone and Parker would make their first major studio-produced feature, BASEketball, for Universal with David Zucker directing (albeit one in which they merely starred in). Parker would very later appear in the 2017 animated Universal Pictures film Despicable Me 3 as the antagonist Balthazar Bratt.  Celebrity appearances  The film is also notable for its use of a number of celebrity actors, musicians, writers, producers, and directors in the Universal family, including Andrew Bergman, James Cameron (shown improving the Universal Studios landscaping), Shaun Cassidy, Robin Cook, Shelley Fabares, George Carlin, Michael J. Fox, Brian Grazer, Heavy D, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Barry Kemp, Angela Lansbury (shown painting the Psycho House), Mike Lobell, Traci Lords, Kevin Misher, Demi Moore, Darrin Pfeiffer, John Singleton, Steven Spielberg (shown as a Universal Studios Guide), Sylvester Stallone (in his Rocky Balboa character, and subtitled for comedic effect), Marty Stuart, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker. Matt Stone appears with Trey Parker as two guys at a food stand during the \\"It's UCS for me!\\" segment.  Recurring themes  Recurring themes/elements in the film include: *Shots of the Jaws \\"shark attack\\" attraction on the Universal Studios Backlot Tour accompanied by the narrated phrase, \\"old and stupid.\\" *Seagrams wine coolers (usually distributed as a gift in order to appease a celebrity) *The placement of porcelain deer in order to beautify a location (usually at the behest of the narrator) *Buttons (sometimes comically oversized) that parody 50s campaign buttons, reading \\"I like Universal,\\" and \\"Universal is A-OK!\\" *As he drinks milk and eats Oreos, Michael J. Fox asks \\"Say, what does that mean?\\" repeatedly throughout the film. This is a direct parody of 1950s educational films, which stereotypically include such characters. *The narrator repeatedly pronounces modernize as \\"modrenized\\". *The overuse of the word \\"say\\" by various characters *The appearance of Stallone, speaking as Rocky Balboa, with subtitles in the bottom of the screen.

Formed by a glacier, it is located in the high Cascade Range in the Deschutes National Forest. The name is from the Chinook Jargon and means variously bad or worthless, or simply \\"in vain\\". In the early 19th century, the lakes in this area abounded with beavers. The earliest explorers to this area were primarily on a quest for furs. Description Satellite image of Cultus Lake Cultus Mountain seen from Little Cultus Lake Cultus Lake lies at the base of the Cultus Mountain. The lake itself is natural and is at its deepest point and about long. Several species of fish inhabit the lake, including rainbow trout, lake trout (mackinaw) and brook trout. The lake also receives several streams inhabited by younger fish. The largest is Winopee Creek, which enters through the marsh on the northwestern side, a popular fly fishing spot. Two miles south is a smaller lake called Little Cultus Lake. The two lakes are divided by Cultus Mountain. The lake empties to the east via Cultus Creek, which flows into Crane Prairie Reservoir. The area around Cultus Lake is known for its large ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and western white pine, sometimes rising to tall. However, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the large pines are being weakened by competing understory fir trees and mountain pine beetle attacks. If the trend is not reversed, there will be a shift in tree species (and tree size) from pine and Douglas-fir to white fir. The service recommends the selective thinning of white fir understory trees around selected ponderosa and western white pine to increase light, and the availability of nutrients, allowing the selected pines to grow more vigorously and increase their resistance to bark beetles. Management policies The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife manages the lake for the natural and hatchery production of rainbow trout and brook trout. They also manage the natural production of Mountain Whitefish and lake trout. Amenities Cultus is a recreational lake and is also popular for water skiing, sailing, jet skiing and boating. The lake has a resort with 23 cabins and a lodge with a restaurant and a store. There are also three other campsites for people to set up tents or park RVs.

Professional career From 1963 to 1979, Thorp was the Crown Solicitor in Gisborne. He sat as a judge in the High Court of New Zealand from 1979 until 1996. In the 1997 New Year Honours, Thorp was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, in recognition of his service as a judge of the High Court. Thorp served as chairman of the National Parole Board and sat as a member of the Court of Appeal. Later life and death After his retirement as a judge, Thorp wrote reports into some controversial matters. In 1997, he reviewed New Zealand's gun control measures, and recommended that all firearms be registered. He also wrote a report into the David Bain case in which he said he was satisfied with the trial verdict. In 1999, he wrote a report into the Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis case. Thorp expressed misgivings with aspects of the case. He could find no corroboration of the children's claims of sexual abuse. He said that section 23G of the Evidence Act should be repealed because it allowed an expert to say that there was no behaviour inconsistent with sexual abuse. His report recommended that the Justice Ministry obtain the opinion of Stephen J. Ceci with regard to the children's evidence. The Ministry has ignored this and other recommendations from Thorp's report. His report contrasts with that written by Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, which upheld Ellis's conviction. In 2005, Thorp published a book entitled Miscarriages of Justice. He researched 53 applications for the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and found that at least 20 applicants may have been wrongly imprisoned. Thorp lived in the Auckland suburb of Parnell. He died on 17 October 2018.

Three green lasers being fired at a single spot in the sky from the Starfire Optical Range. FASOR used at the Starfire Optical Range for LIDAR and laser guide star experiments is tuned to the sodium D2a line and used to excite sodium atoms in the upper atmosphere. Starfire Optical Range (SOR - Pronounced as an initialism) is a United States Air Force research laboratory on the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Its primary duty, according to the official website, is to \\"develop and demonstrate optical wavefront control technologies.\\" The range is a secure lab facility and is a division of the Directed Energy Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory. SOR's optical equipment includes a 3.5 meter telescope which is \\"one of the largest telescopes in the world equipped with adaptive optics designed for satellite tracking\\" according to the Air Force, a 1.5 meter telescope, and a 1-meter beam director. Purpose The purpose of Starfire is to conduct research to use adaptive optics to remove the effects of scintillation (atmospheric turbulence). Turbulence interferes with laser beam integrity over distances. Lasers are being used for long-distance high-bandwidth communications and accuracy in air-to-air laser connectivity is important for data integrity. Scintillation is also a problem in development of weaponized lasers, such as the airborne laser being developed to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles. According to an article published on May 3, 2006 in the New York Times, research is being conducted at the laboratory into how to use ground-based lasers to disable satellites; that is, as an anti-satellite weapon.

Pre-Tour career Born in Paris, Prudhomme studied at the ESJ school of journalism in Lille from 1983 to 1985. He joined RTL (Radio-T√©l√©vision Luxembourg) in 1985 with the encouragement of his tutor, Michel Cellier, who was RTL correspondent in the Nord region. He joined RTL on trial. RTL did not keep him on and Prudhomme moved to RFO and then on 3 August 1987 to the television channel, La Cinq, as a sports reporter under Pierre Cangioni. He reported in particular on his favourite sports: cycling, rugby, athletics and skiing. Of those, his favourite was cycling and he reported regularly on the Midi Libre and Paris‚ÄìNice stage races. He said of cycling: :When I was a kid, I listened on average to the last 100 km of a stage. We didn't have the last 120 km of racing on France T√©l√©visions that we have now. There was a report at 100 km to go on the radio and we were very happy to get the last 15 km live. Then I used to listen on Belgian radio to a man, I don't know if he's dead, called Luc Varenne, an extraordinary man. My father always listened to the radio and regularly to sport. I was nourished on that ever since I was tiny. :Cycling has always made me dream, even if today, alas, it is in a mess. It is an extraordinary sport, a legend of a sport, a sport of legends. It's almost as hard as boxing and combat sports. It takes place in exceptional conditions, obviously the mountains, the cobbles. It's a sport where anything can happen. The weather plays a significant part and the riders have to confront it. It has always made me dream.http://jerome.benoit.free.fr/prudhomme.htm Prudhomme became head of sport at La Cinq. He occasionally presented sports bulletins at midday. In 1992 that failed through lack of funds and Prudhomme freelanced for a year before joining the news channel, LCI. He had barely agreed to join when Eug√®ne Saccomano, head of sport at the radio station Europe1 invited him to replace Jean-Ren√© Godart, who was leaving to join the television network, France 2. In 1998 he was in at the start of a cable channel, L'√âquipe TV, television companion to the daily sports paper and run by Amaury Group, whose subsidiary, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), is the organiser of the Tour de France. He became editor-in-chief. In 2000 he joined France T√©l√©visions to modernise its sports programme, Stade 2. He commentated at the Tour de France for France T√©l√©visions in 2000, alongside the former winner, Bernard Th√©venet. Tour de France In 2007, Prudhomme replaced Jean-Marie Leblanc as director of the Tour de France, having been his assistant director for three years. Under Prudhomme, the Tour has strengthened its opposition to doping. In 2007, two teams ‚Äì Astana and Cofidis ‚Äì withdrew from the Tour after doping scandals. In 2008, the ASO withdrew the Tour from the aegis of the UCI to implement its own anti-doping regime. Astana was not invited and, that same year, Saunier Duval- Scott withdrew after Riccardo Ricc√≤'s test for third-generation synthetic EPO. Prudhomme suggested that the positive test was part of a doping programme organised by the team manager. During the 2020 Tour de France, Prudhomme tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, he had to self-isolate for seven days, and was not in the Tour's lead car for stages 10 to 16.

Route description US 51 enters Tennessee at Memphis and runs north through the cities of Millington, Munford, Atoka, Brighton, Covington, Henning, Ripley, Halls, Dyersburg, Troy, Union City, and South Fulton. Memphis This highway crosses four interstate highways on its journey through the state and actually crosses Interstate 240 twice within the City of Memphis but interchanges with it only at Union Avenue. US 51 is the westernmost south- north United States Highway in the State of Tennessee. US 51 is an interstate standard facility from Dyersburg to South of Troy and then resuming interstate standard status north of Union City to South Fulton. US 51 is a four-lane or larger facility throughout the state with some sections north of Dyersburg carrying a speed limit. Near Henning is also the site of the Hatchie River Bridge collapse on April 1, 1989 that killed 8 motorists when 3 spans of the structure collapsed.

From Memphis to Henning, most of the original two lane road was upgraded to four lane expressway in the 1960s. Future Most of US 51 north of Dyersburg is expected to be upgraded as part of future Interstate 69. Plans currently call for Interstate 69 to run along the existing US 51 freeway from Dyersburg to Troy and from Union City to South Fulton. This section is part of SIU 7 for Interstate 69 and will require few changes beyond resigning the existing highway, however, a bypass route around Troy and Union City will need to be built before this section of future Interstate 69 is completed.

US 51 Bus./SR 211 then split before heading through neighborhoods along Troy Avenue before turning right onto Gordon Street. The highway then makes a left turn onto North Sampson Avenue and passes through more neighborhoods before merging onto St. John Avenue. They then travel through a business district before widening to a four-lane highway and coming to an end at an intersection with US 51/SR 3, where US 51 Bus. ends and SR 211 follows northbound US 51/SR 3 north on St. John Avenue.

Customer base within this meaning generally satisfies the conditions for recognizing it as a type of non-technical know-how. Customer base may be traded, in particular, it may be sold, it is possible to authorize someone to use it. Customer base may be also contributed to the company as an in-kind contribution.  Building The Base  All businesses begin with no customers. These start-ups begin with an abstract idea that slowly evolves into something someone will buy. As these products evolve from abstract ideas into primitive objects that are then further refined, the business that created the product begins to gain customers. The satisfied customers become the repeat buyers and core customer of the company. This is the process that creates the customer base. Most often, successful start-ups begin with low-end or downmarket customers with low income and low costs. As the products or services that are being bought are polished and remade, a company gains higher-end customers who gain interest in the product as it reaches higher levels of functionality, use, or value. As the shift to these higher priority customers continue, they begin to be a larger source of income for the company, and slowly become the main base whom the business lends the most importance. This process, of moving from low- end customers to more expensive and more profitable customers, is known as upstreaming, and is an integral part of the theory of disruptive innovation. Businesses work very competitively to keep their core market intact. The sellers will research their buyers to increase customer awareness. Keeping products customer oriented has become so huge a priority, in fact, that it has become a large focus of business schools to teach all types of business administrators, from manager to marketer, to keeping the customer in mind for the improvement and creation of sellable products. It is very rare for an established company to lose its core customers to incumbents, and it has been stated that when an established company loses their consumer base via sudden and straightforward methods, it was not an ingenious move of the incumbent that allowed this to happen, but rather a result of the established company ‚Äúdropping the ball.‚Äù  The Customer-Base Customer  As companies grow their customer base, and gain experience satisfying them, their customers grow accustomed to that business accomplishing a certain task for them. The company or product‚Äôs brand name may even correlate with the task the customer uses it for. Xerox, Kleenex, and Band-Aid are some extreme cases of brand-names being used as the generic name of the product itself. In fact, as long as customers are continually satisfied with their purchases, the act of going to that company‚Äôs brand to accomplish a specific task becomes habitual. Repeat buyers and users are also useful for further reasons, as they are the source of ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù advertising. Studies have shown that customer satisfaction with a brand leads to more purchases, from both the same and new customers. A satisfied customer expresses their enjoyment in the product, or even shows a friend the product and has them try it out, and a dissatisfied customer may speak against a product or not mention it at all. Of course, the core consumer is the main spreader of the company‚Äôs brand name, and the more they use and like what they consume, the more those that surround them will gain interest and then potentially become customers themselves.  Shifting of Customer Priority  Content consumers eventually become fully saturated, and no longer desire the product to be upgraded as it had been before. This customer begins to lose interest, and stops becoming a regular buyer for the business. As a company tends to drift upmarket, many lower-end customers do not keep up. These customers then tend to turn to other companies for alternative products or services that have features they value over the original company's usual upgrades. The original company also allows these customers to leave, as they have shifted priority to higher-end customers. As old core customers lose priority, the company that sold to them does not fight very hard to keep them. Fighting for the old customers could risk losing the new, more profitable people. This allows new start-up businesses to start moving upstream by interesting and attaining these customers for themselves, as the start-up goes through the same cycles that the established company went through. By chasing after higher-end customers and letting less profitable customers lose priority and be taken away from rising incumbents, a business manages to shift its base to entirely new sets of people.

Holding up to 12,000 people, it was also Berlin's largest concert venue, until the opening of O2 World in 2008. It is part of a larger complex, which includes a swimming pool as well, built in the course of the unsuccessful Berlin application for the 2000 Summer Olympics. This project is related to the German reunification and the wish of a city, Berlin, about to become the capital, to be nominated for the Olympic Games. It replaced the former Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle, which was demolished in 1993. It mainly hosts indoor sporting events, trade shows and concerts. Architecture The building was designed by French architect Dominique Perrault who won an international design competition in 1992 and was awarded the German Award of Architecture, second prize for the Velodrome and the Olympic Swimming pool . The site chosen is at the intersection of urban elements and of different networks. In order to resolve the conjunction of these two systems, the buildings which house the velodrome and the Olympic Swimming Pool vanish from sight. The idea was to create an orchard of apple trees with two buildings set into the ground, one round and the other rectangular, covered with a wire gauze, which shimmer in the sunlight and appear to be stretches of water more than buildings.

The emirate was a protectorate of the Mamluk Sultanate until the end of 14th century, then it was de facto independent for more than a century, and then, from 1517, a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire. The capital was Adana. The Ramadanid Emirate was the only emirate in Anatolia that was not a successor of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate. It is often misclassified as an Anatolian beylik, though it was an entity under the Mamluks. Cilicia was part of the Seljuks for a short time around the turn of the 11th century, and thus was not affected by the Sunni tariqa expansionism of the 13th century. In the late 14th century, the Y√ºreƒüir Turks moved to Cilicia and had a distinct culture with influence from Bektashi traditions of shamanic rituals along with Islam.  History  Mongol invasion of Asia forced Oghuz Turks to migrate into Anatolia and Levant in great numbers. A Turkish tribe, from Y√ºreƒüir in Transoxiana, settled in the northern regions of Mamluk Sultanate, from Antioch to Gaza with the approval of the Sultan. They were known in the Middle East as T√ºrkmens or Y√ºreƒüirli (en:from Y√ºreƒüir) During Ramadanid era, Cilicia was a buffer state between two Islamic powers. Ramazanoƒülu Hall The Ilkhanate fell into disarray after the death of Abu Sa'id, thus could not support Armenian Kingdom in guarding Cilicia. In addition, internal conflicts within Armenian Kingdom made T√ºrkmens turn their eyes to unstable Cilicia, and in 1352, Ramazan Beg led Turkmens settled south of √áaldaƒüƒ± and founded their first settlement, Camili. Later that year, Ramazan Beg visited Cairo and was assented by the Sultan to establish the new frontier Turkmen Emirate in Cilicia. Y√ºreƒüir T√ºrkmens lived as a small community for 7 years in southeast of Adana, and named their new land, Y√ºreƒüir. In 1359, Mamluk Sultanate Army marched into Cilicia and took over Adana and Tarsus, two major cities of the plain, leaving few castles to Armenians.In 1375, Mamluks gained the control of the remaining areas of Cilicia, thus ending the three centuries rule of Armenians. Mamluk Sultanate authorized Ramazan Beg led T√ºrkmen Emirate to administer Cilicia, but took direct control of the towns, Tarsus, Ayas, Sarvandikar, Sis at the four corners of Cilicia plain and appointed an Amir and a Garrison for each. Tarsus, the former capital of Cilicia, were settled by the moors that arrived from Egypt. T√ºrkmen Emirate which began to be known as Ramadanids, set the city of Adana as their center of power, and many T√ºrkmen families of Y√ºreƒüir origin moved to the city. Ramazanoƒülu Madrasah Hasan Aƒüa mosque After the death of Ramazan Bey, his son Ibrahim Bey made alliance with the Karaman Emirate. Alaeddin Bey and Ibrahim Bey together tried to remove the Mameluks' control in the province. After this alliance a great Mameluk army moved in and began to plunder but Ibrahim Bey's army achieved a great victory against the Mameluks in Belen. Also in this battle Temur Bey, the general of the Mameluks, had been captured. Yilboga, the amir of Aleppo moved on to the Turkmens after this defeat and he conquered Misis Castle. The Ramadanids played an important role in 15th century Ottoman-Mamluk relations, being a buffer state located in the Mamluk al-'Awasim frontier zone. In 1516, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608, with the last 92 years as a vassal of the Ottomans.

Charlotina was the suggested name for a popularly proposed British crown colony which was to be established in America following the end of the Seven Years' War, in which Great Britain had acquired a large portion of New France in 1763. However, the proposal was met with little official enthusiasm, as the British government's Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade the creation of new colonies in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Had such a colony been founded, it would have included the region lying west of the Maumee and Wabash rivers; north of the Ohio River; east of the upper Mississippi River; and south of the Great Lakes.Alvord, Critical Period, p. 139 These boundaries would include portions of modern-day Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and the entirety of Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Charlotina would have included modern-day cities such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Toledo, Detroit, Fort Wayne, and parts of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Background Charlotina was one of several new colonies proposed by various socio-political factions in Britain and North America following the Treaty of Paris of 1763. The argument for the establishment of Charlotina first appeared that same year in a pamphlet entitled \\"The Expediency of Securing our American Colonies by Settling the Country Adjoining the River Mississippi, and the Country upon the Ohio, Considered', which was published in Edinburgh, Scotland. Similar to the Mississippi Land Company's proposal for a new colony in the same area, nothing came of either proposal, due in large part to the expansion-limiting provisions of the Royal Proclamation Act of 1763. Variations The title of the proposed colony is spelled \\"Charlotiana\\" in some historical sources, a result of a manuscript error being repeated.Alvord, Critical Period, p. 139, note 1. Variations of the name, including \\"Charlottina\\" and \\"Charlotta\\", were revived in 1770 as suggestions for a proposed colony with different boundaries (roughly equivalent to present-day West Virginia), but the name \\"Vandalia\\" was chosen instead. \\"Charlotina\\" was chosen as a name in honor of Queen Charlotte,\\"The Expediency of Securing Our American Colonies, &c.;\\" (1763). p. 14.

It catered mainly towards independent music but did not discriminate between the relative popularity of the bands it features. Plan B also documented alternative culture such as film, comics, video games, visual art and books. It was founded by editor-in-chief Everett True (a.k.a. Jerry Thackray), art director Andrew Clare and publisher Chris Houghton, although later editor and publisher Frances Morgan was also a major influence. In May 2009, it was announced that Plan Bs forty-sixth issue would be its last. Background Plan B was started after the demise of the magazine Careless Talk Costs Lives, which shared a similar ethos and many of the same contributors. Ethos The concept originally laid down by Thackray was to exist under the radar of the mainstream music press such as the New Musical Express or Q, both of which are seen as the antithesis of Plan B. Although Thackray used to work in the mainstream media throughout the nineties under the pseudonym Everett True along with his CTCL compatriot Steve Gullick, he became disheartened by the lack of individuality and increased focus on commercialism. Thus, Plan B (along with Gullick's Loose Lips Sink Ships) was created to champion causes apparently forgotten in the mainstream press. Plan B tried to mirror the artistic nature of its content by including full page photography and colourful illustrations. This is largely due to the work of art director Andrew Clare. It is also printed in full colour on thick, satin paper, which creates a musky scent. The emphasis of Plan B was on nurturing young talent and subsequently, many of the writers are unknown within their field. Several regular contributors do freelance work for the mainstream music press but their work in Plan B was usually more varied because the magazine did not impose a 'house style' on its writers. This often led to a more anecdotal, emotional response to art - a style which is discouraged in the mainstream press. This was reflected in the magazine's reviews, which did not contain the 'grading' or 'marking' system so commonly found elsewhere. In keeping with this ethos, Plan B commonly covered artists with little mainstream appeal. The contributors as a whole did not distinguish between artists within the mainstream and those in the left-field but the bias is arguably towards the latter. Thackray is also renowned for being a champion of equality within music, whether sexual, gender-based or racial. Indeed, detractors have in the past labelled his supposed bias towards female-helmed bands to be over- zealous. Of course, this could also be seen as a genuine attempt by Thackray to redress the balance in a male dominated music press. In September 2006, Plan B changed its frequency from bi-monthly to monthly. In a post-mortem piece of the magazine as part of Drowned in Sound's Music Journalism R.I.P? Week, former staff writer kicking_k said of Plan Bs demise: \\"Had we been selling more issues, there would have been a buffer, we may have been able to ride out the drought. I think it‚Äôs important could-be readers realise that ‚Äì if there‚Äôs a magazine out there you still plan on reading month after month, brace yourself and buy it ‚Äì every edition of Plan B, surveys say, was read by four people.

He has served as a PA voice for five World Series (, , , and ), two Major League Baseball All Star Games (1976 and 1996), and three NFC Championship Games (2002, 2003, and 2004). Though the Phillies and Eagles left Veterans Stadium for new venues (the Eagles to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003 and the Phillies to Citizens Bank Park in 2004), Baker remained the PA announcer for both teams. He also serves as PA announcer for the Army‚ÄìNavy Game when it is played in Philadelphia as well as Drexel University Dragons men's basketball. After the 2009 retirement of the New York Yankees' Bob Sheppard, Baker became the longest-tenured PA announcer in Major League Baseball. Between Baker and former Chicago Cubs' public address announcer Pat Pieper, the 2020 MLB season will mark 104 consecutive seasons that one of them has been announcing games. Pieper from 1916‚Äì1974 and Baker from 1972‚Äìpresent. The last game that was played without Pieper or Baker announcing games was the 1915 World Series on October 13, 1915. Baker was the radio announcer for Drexel University Dragons men's basketball on WNTP 990 AM from 1997‚Äì2012, after which he retired and became the team's public address announcer. Before that, he broadcast Philadelphia BIG 5 Basketball games for 21 years while additionally serving as its executive director from 1981‚Äì96. Baker was named to the Big 5 Hall of Fame in 1997 and was inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. Baker co-hosts a radio show on WBCB (AM) 1490 called \\"Bull Session\\" with former Philadelphia Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski, for whom the show is named. The show airs at 6:00 pm on Monday nights, and each week they bring in a special guest, usually a current or retired player. Baker reprises his role as the Philadelphia Phillies PA announcer for select Phillies away games at multiple venues that comprise a chain of Philadelphia area sports bars. The events are billed as \\"Summer Nights with Dan Baker\\". At these appearances, Baker announces the game over the sports bar's PA system in exactly the same fashion as he would if he was announcing an actual Phillies home game. On May 7, 2014, the Eagles announced that Baker would no longer serve as their public address announcer, citing that they decided to make a change in the role. Baker continued as the public address announcer for the Phillies. On September 16, 2015, XFINITY Live! announced that Baker would be the in-house public address announcer for Philadelphia Eagles games. Baker's duties are similar to those he had as the public address announcer for the Eagles, which include energizing the crowd with his signature calls.

Influenced by indigenous religion, Catholicism, and European witchcraft, the purpose may range from benevolent white magic to evil black magic.Herrera- Sobek (2012), p. 175. A male practitioner is called a , a female practitioner is a .  Concept  Across the Afro-Latin diaspora, many forms of spiritual practices have emerged: Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santer√≠a, and Brazilian Candombl√© and Umbanda. However, what sets Brujer√≠a in Puerto Rico apart is the unique blend of ‚Äúreligiosity and spiritualized materialism‚Äù. Isabelo Zen√≥n Cruz made the assessment that Puerto Rican vernacular religions (and really any Afro- Latino religions) have been only studied by folklorists but not comparative religionists due to ‚Äúclassist and racist assumptions‚Äù. Unlike many other Caribbean religions that derive from Africa, Brujer√≠a is not based on stable community, hierarchy, or membership. Instead, practices are more dependent on the ritual preferences of the actual participants. Because of the spontaneity of the spirits, it is impossible for institutionalized doctrines of worships to be enforced on followers and practicers of Brujer√≠a. Within sacred altars of brujos, lessons of practitioners, and brujer√≠a rituals lie ties to African ideologies, Catholicism, and Spiritism; explaining the erasure of hierarchical order. Before Spiritism was developed, Ta√≠no Indians and enslaved African people in Puerto Rico developed the convictions that there exists spirits and those spirits can be communicated with. This becomes mixed with the convictions of spiritual worship introduced by Catholic colonizers. Early leaders of Spiritism found interest in Brujer√≠a amongst liberal, emancipation minded groups in the late nineteenth century; begging the interest for further research of the correlation between politics and Brujer√≠a.  Origins  Early Brujer√≠a can be traced back as far as the 1500s when the archbishop of Santo Domingo and fifth bishop of Puerto Rico, Nicol√°s Ramos, recorded his recollections of ‚Äòblack brujos [male and female] who engaged with the devil in the shape of a goat and, every night in front of this goat, cursed God, Santa Mar√≠a, and the sacraments of the Holy Church.‚Äô‚Äô Ramos wrote, ‚Äò‚Äò[A]sserting that they did not have nor believe in a god other than that devil‚Ä¶they performed these rituals in some fields [apparently they were in a trance] ,‚Ä¶not in dreams since there were some people who saw them.‚Äô‚Äô These people, Ramos continues, ‚Äò‚Äòtried to make them [the sorcerers] refrain from their doings through chanting and holy gifts [ d√°divas ], and with all this [information they] came to me.‚Äô‚Äù This perpetual demonization of elements of African worship set up the forefront to the centuries of demonization of Brujer√≠a practices. From the sixteenth to the subsequent eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, slaves were shipped from Africa to Puerto Rico and Hispaniola and were forced to convert to Christianity by the imposing church and the overseeing hacendados‚Äîland owners. Branded slaves were baptized to be fully recognized as the property of hacendados. In the late 1800s to early 1900s during the early days of American occupation within Cuba, there were established attacks to undermine the legitimacy of several Afro-Cuban institutions and organizations‚Äî including Brujer√≠a. With the growth of a single Cuban identity came a greater appreciation for conformity and deviation from ‚Äúcreolised manifestations‚Äù. However, the declination of faith-based practices in Cuba due to the rise in Marxism from 1959 to the 1990s lead to practitioners of Afro-Cuban religions to have to find innovative ways to survive Castro‚Äôs political informants that particularly called for the suppression of witchcraft and Brujer√≠a. The introduction of Spiritism in the twentieth century attracted more participants of all racial backgrounds. It also added new foundations of practice and ritualistic objects such as: santiguos (healing blessings), 19 despojos (spiritual cleansings), prayers, and spells; and an array of indigenous, medieval Catholic, and African offerings.  Modernization of Brujer√≠a  Despite Brujer√≠a inheriting traits from Catholicism, there has been a long history of the Catholic Church demonizing Brujer√≠a, referring to it as \\"evil, Satanism\\", or the \\"workings of the devil\\". That being said, with the increasing rate of persecution amongst practitioners since colonization of the Afro-Latino Caribbean, Brujer√≠a has been forced into modernization to combat erasure. As separatist ideals begin to gain more momentum, particularly in Puerto Rico, there becomes more clings to cultural nationalism‚Äî including clings to aspects of Afro-Boricua and Ta√≠no folklore. Previously (1950s‚Äì1960s), journalists in the island denounced Brujer√≠a as a way to help ‚Äúeducate the masses‚Äù. However, the shift in cultural nationalism from the 1980s onwards now leads to media outlets uncovering ‚Äúhidden traditions‚Äù of the ‚Äúendangered Puerto Rican Hispanic, Ta√≠no, and African traditions‚Äù Romberg argues the practice of modern-day Brujer√≠a as \\"the vernacular co-optation of discourses of interest and passions, of consumerism and spirituality, commodity fetishism and morality, and welfare capitalism and magic\\". And also reveals that despite misconceptions, Brujer√≠a builds to social order through both ‚Äúholistic or individualized types of intervention‚Äù and endorsement of positive ‚Äúmainstream social values‚Äù.  Practice  Brujer√≠a doesn't participate in community, hierarchical, or initiation-based practice or membership. Rituals are interdependent on the procedures, practices, and attitudes passed down by its participants and heavily depend on forces of nature and the spontaneity of the spirits. Following specific guidelines and doctrines in Brujer√≠a is possible . However, some commonalities include basic ritual gestures, communication during divination, possession, and specific components of altars. These similarities are often referred to as ‚Äúa kind of spiritual lingua franca‚Äù which explains the ubiquity of the practice cross the Afro-Latino and Non-Afro-Latino diaspora. In practice, brujos stress to not believe in the ritualistic objects or hold too much pertinence in the material representations of the spiritual entities, but rather focus on the messages and ‚Äúpowers of the entities that inhabit these icons‚Äù that are also used to summon ancient demons. Power is sensed and manifested when the voices of Spiritist entities, Santer√≠a orishas, and the recently deceased are brought on by ‚ÄúBrujer√≠a rituals, divination, trance and the making of magic works‚Äù. The spirits' abstract means of revelation include through emotions, through senses, and through healings as a means to transform the ‚Äúemotional, proprioceptive and (to some extent) physiological states of participants‚Äù Whereas a lot of focus within the practice of Brujer√≠a is on the technological systems, Brujer√≠a focuses mostly on interpersonal client-patient power that ‚Äúemerges during healing, divination and magic rituals challenges the assumed precondition‚Äù; specifically in regards to health, labor, family relations, and even career management. Brujos and practitioners of Brujer√≠a never question the spirits. The performative methods of surrender training is the only lesson brujos aim to teach. The expectation is to have faith in the spirits and the spirits will theatrically reveal what is meant to be shown.

It was grown from a crossing of the complex interspecific hybrid Landot 4511 and a very cold hardy selection of Vitis riparia. It was released in 1996. Frontenac gris is a white wine version of Frontenac, introduced in 2003. It started as a single bud mutation of Frontenac, yielding gray (thus named gris) fruit and amber-colored juice. Frontenac blanc will be introduced in 2012 from white fruited mutations found in both Frontenac and Frontenac gris vines in Minnesota and Canada.  Vine and viticulture  Frontenac grapes growing in Michigan. The vines produce loose clusters of dark, highly acidic, high sugar berries. Frontenac is quite vigorous, extremely cold hardy (below -30C), highly resistant to downy mildew, and resistant to powdery mildew and botrytis. Frontenac grapes are much smaller than traditional grapes and grow in tight clusters. Frontenac grapes produce a mild grape flavor.  Wine characteristics  A young Frontenac gris grapevine. Frontenac has been used for the production of dry red wines, rose, as well as for fortified wine in the style of port. The wines produced from Frontenac typically present aromas of cherry and other red fruits. While producing a pleasing wine, the ripeness of the grapes is difficult to judge from sugar levels alone, and wine-makers are often challenged by its high acidity and atypical pH levels. Frontenac gris wines present aromas of peach and apricot with hints of enticing citrus and tropical fruit. A brilliant balance of fruit and acidity creates lively, refreshing wines. Unique and complex flavors make this an excellent grape for table, dessert, and ice wines. Initial trial vinifications of Frontenac blanc indicate that it produces wines that are distinctly different from Frontenac gris in flavor and aroma. The University of Minnesota plans to evaluate and characterize Frontenac blanc lines as they are made available.  Regional production  Although the grape has a very short history, its promise as a wine grape for very cold regions has led to many plantings across the northeastern part of the United States and Canada.

The outstation movement or homeland movement refers to the voluntary relocation of Aboriginal people from towns to these locations. The outstation movement A movement arose in the 1970s and continued through the 1980s which saw the creation of very small, remote settlements of Aboriginal people who relocated themselves from the towns and settlements where they had been settled by the government's policy of assimilation. It was \\"a move towards reclaiming autonomy and self- sufficiency\\". Also known as \\"homelands\\", the term outstation\\" was adopted as it \\"suggests a dependent relationship between the outstation and the main homestead, but with a degree of separation\\". Outstations were created by Aboriginal people who \\"sought... autonomy in deciding the meaning of their life independently of projects promoted by the state and market\\", and could be seen as a sign of remote Aboriginal Australians' attempt at self- determination. The underlying similarity among outstations is that the residents are living there by choice, sometimes because they wish to protect sacred sites and to retain connections to ancestral lands and ancestors, or because they wish to live off the land, or to escape social dysfunction prevalent in larger towns and communities (as later described in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991). Government support for outstations has ebbed and flowed over time. During the 1970s and 1980s several groups moved from towns, missions and former Aboriginal reserves to smaller settlements on their traditional lands. Governments were supportive of the moves, seeing benefits in health and well-being, maintenance of culture and the preservation of connection to country, known to be of great significance to Aboriginal people. The policy of decentralisation came with moves towards self-determination and land rights, after it was realised that the earlier policies of assmimilation had failed. For about 30 years, the Commonwealth government assumed responsibility for the outstations, despite a lack of underlying policy, and they grew in number, particularly in the Northern Territory. There is a large diversity among the outstations: most comprise small family groups, a fewer have more than 100 people. Some are only seasonally or rarely occupied, and in most there is much movement of people between the outstations and larger centres. Some have or had thriving local economies based on arts centres, employment as Indigenous rangers, and harvesting plants and animals from nature, while others are dependent on welfare income. Terminology Terminology has varied over time and by region. In a 2009 policy statement on homelands by the Northern Territory Government, it said: NT continues to use the term Homeland Learning Centres for a particular type of educational facility provided to the small communities. 1987 report In 1987 an inquiry into \\"[t]he social and economic circumstances of Aboriginal people living in homeland centres or outstations, and the development of policies and programs to meet their future needs\\" was undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, chaired by Allen Blanchard. On 14 May 1987 the Committee tabled its report (the \\"Blanchard Report\\"), entitled Return to country: the Aboriginal homelands movement in Australia. It defined homelands as \\"small decentralised communities of close kin established by the movement of Aboriginal people to land of social, cultural and economic significance to them\\". PDF It said that the definition of homelands should include: Whole book; Chapter 4: Sustaining Aboriginal homeland communities *acknowledgement of the significance of Aboriginal peoples moving ¬Éback to traditional country *a clear distinction between homelands and settlements, missions or ¬Éreserves; *an acknowledgement of the traditional connection to the land and the ¬Éancestral spirits; and *a description of the permanency of homelands as traditional home ¬Éterritory. The Blanchard report gave formal recognition of the importance of outstations, giving 58 recommendations aimed at \\"improving the economic security and viability of outstations and increasing the level of services available to outstation residents\\". At this time the good effects of outstations on residents' quality of life and aspirations were recognised. 1990s‚Äì2000s Funding the outstations proved extremely expensive, and as government ideologies changed, they were seen as wasteful of resources. Adequate health services were not provided and training and employment opportunities were not funded. By the 1990s the difficulties emerged with the decentralisation process: some services were extremely expensive to deliver to multiple tiny communities in remote places with few possibilities for economic self-sufficiency. From 1990, the outstations were largely funded via the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which was established in 1990. Services were provided to outstations by small organisations based in a parent community known as an Outstation Resource Centre (ORA). A review was commissioned by ATSIC in 1997, at which time there were about 12,000 Indigenous Australians living at about 1,000 outstations. It was intended to provide data that would reduce waste and improve efficiency, while supported by the commissioners who allocated funding.Altman, J., Gillespie, D. and Palmer, K. 1998. National Review of Resource Agencies Servicing Indigenous Communities, 1998. Canberra: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. By this time, there had been a lot of criticism by politicians, and there were indeed many examples of waste, new houses built in uninhabited places, and suchlike. However, there were also thriving and well- run communities, and it was intended to review the funding of the ORAs, increase accountability and implement management techniques which would keep the elements of outstations which improved the lives of their residents. By this time, however, the costs associated with running the outstations were very high, and political will had dwindled. Recommendations were made on the assumption that ATSIC, or something similar, would continue. From 2004 there was a major shift in both policy at both state and federal level with regard to funding outstations. John Howard abolished ATSIC in 2005, after saying a year earlier that \\"the experiment in elected representation for Indigenous people has been a failure\\". In September 2007, during the Northern Territory National Emergency Response (\\"The Intervention\\"), the Howard government gave responsibility for outstations back to the Territory. By this act, the chronic underfunding was continued. The NT developed a new policy, contained in a framework called \\"Working Future\\", published in May 2009. The policy targeted delivery of support and services to 20 larger Aboriginal communities in the NT, to be called \\"Territory Growth Towns\\", which would benefit from federal funding. This ended the 20-year commitment to support homelands following the Blanchard review in 1987. By 2009, there were 560 small communities, mostly inhabited by fewer than 100 people scattered across the NT. They are nearly all located on Aboriginal-owned land, which covers about . In May 2009, the Northern Territory Government issued a policy statement on outstations/homelands, in which it stated that it: \\"values the contribution of outstations and homelands to the economic social and cultural life of the Territory...\\". The policy outlined new service delivery processes, snd \\"introduce[d] a new disbursement model based on a more realistic framework for the allocation of limited government resources... consistent with [federal] Government policy on remote service delivery\\". It said that it would continue to support current outstations, where residents reside for a minimum of 8-9 months a year, and where there was an adequate supply of fresh drinking water, but residents must \\"commit to increasing self-sufficiency\\". While it was not opposed to Aboriginal people creating new remote communities, they would have to be self-funded. It would continue to support Homeland Learning Centres and schools. The Australian Human Rights Commission's Social Justice Report for 2009, submitted by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Tom Calma, devoted a chapter to \\"Sustaining Aboriginal homeland communities\\". After outlining the definitions of and criteria for successful homelands and the history of the homelands movement, it criticised the government's withdrawal of funding, saying that \\"if government policies fail to support the ongoing development of homelands it will lead to social and economic problems in rural townships that could further entrench Indigenous disadvantage and poverty\\". In 2009. about 81% of Northern Territory's Indigenous people lived in remote or very remote communities. The report recommended: 2010s According to NT politician Alison Anderson in 2013, there were 10,000 people living on 520 homelands, representing about 25 per cent of the remote Indigenous population of the NT, in about 2,400 dwellings. She spoke of the benefits of the homelands, \\"in health and wellbeing and social harmony\\". She said that her government reaffirmed the integral role of the homelands in the Territory, and were committed to providing homelands residents with the same services as other residents of the NT, \\"within reason\\". In December 2014, the Government of Western Australia under Colin Barnett announced that it would cease funding 150 remote communities because it lacked the funds. , there were about 1,200 outstations in Australia, and seen as significant for the maintenance of culture, language and relationships, thus contributing to health and well-being. Present and future Individual small communities continue to exist, although not described as outstations because they are not part of a federal or other program that advocates \\"the homeland ideal\\"; \\"settlements\\" is the more usual term these days. They survive on one-off grants for such things as Indigenous business enterprise or environmental protection (Indigenous Protected Areas), private contributions by their residents, or royalties from mineral exploration on their land.

The complex is home to a Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express hotel, conference facilities and multi-purpose arena. The arena hosted local sporting events, including the Aberdeen Cup tennis event. In 2003, the AECC underwent a major refurbishment, with the conference facilities being completely re-built. As part of the redevelopment, a large viewing tower was constructed and is one of the tallest structures in Aberdeen.

He was awarded the prestigious FIFA Pusk√°s Award the following year for this particular effort. History =Penang Island National Stadium (1945‚Äì2003)= Construction of the City Stadium commenced on 1 October 1945, just after the end of the Second World War. Upon completion in 1948, it was officially named the Penang Island National Stadium. The stadium was expanded by the British government in 1950 and underwent further renovation in 1953. =City Stadium (2003‚Äìpresent)= The Penang Island National Stadium was eventually renamed the City Stadium in 2003. Another round of renovation works was conducted in the 2000s. However, as George Town had already been densely developed, under the confined urban constraints the City Stadium could not be expanded further. The Penang FA had briefly moved to the Penang State Stadium in Batu Kawan on the mainland due to capacity concerns, but in 2011, the state football team then returned to the City Stadium.

It runs in a southwest-to-northeast direction from the Southern Tier to the northern part of Lake George. The southern terminus of the route is at an interchange with NY 17, where it begins concurrent with NY 10 in the town of Deposit. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY 9N in the town of Hague. Roughly midway between the two endpoints, NY 8 passes through Utica, where it overlaps NY 5, NY 12, and Interstate 790 (I-790) along one segment of the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial. NY 8 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and originally extended north to a ferry across Lake Champlain at Putnam Station, where it connected to Vermont Route F-10 (VT F-10). The route was realigned slightly on its northern end by 1933 to connect to another ferry leading to VT F-9 east of Ticonderoga. By the following year, it was altered again to use the new Champlain Bridge at Crown Point to connect to VT 17\\\\. This was made possible by way of a long concurrency with NY 9N and NY 22\\\\. NY 8 was truncated to its current northern terminus . In the 1960s and 1970s, NY 8 was moved onto new freeways around and through the city of Utica. The 2017 route log erroneously shows that NY 8's southern terminus is at what is the northern terminus of the overlap with NY 10. Route description =Southern Tier= NY 8 begins at an interchange with NY 17 in Deposit that also serves as the southern terminus of NY 10\\\\. NY 8 and NY 10 form a brief concurrency north along the West Branch of the Delaware River before separating at the southeastern edge of the Cannonsville Reservoir northeast of Deposit. While NY 10 follows the southern edge of the reservoir to the east, NY 8 continues north, passing to the east of Oquaga Creek State Park (and connecting to the park via a pair of local roads) before meeting NY 206 in Masonville. From Masonville, NY 8 heads north to Sidney, where it meets I-88 at an interchange, crosses the Susquehanna River, and intersects NY 7 before leaving the village adjacent to the Unadilla River, a tributary of the Susquehanna. NY 8 and NY 10 passing through Deposit, just north of the interchange with NY 17 NY 8 parallels the Unadilla River northward through Mount Upton to New Berlin, where it meets NY 80\\\\. The routes overlap for a short distance to the north before NY 80 separates to the northwest toward Sherburne. NY 8, however, continues along the Unadilla River through several small communities before separating from the river just south of the Madison-Oneida County line. =Utica area= Shortly after crossing into Oneida County, NY 8 intersects U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Bridgewater. The route continues northward, passing through Cassville and Clayville before becoming a limited-access highway just north of Clayville. Near Sauquoit, NY 8 has exits for Pinnacle Road and Elm Street prior to entering the Utica suburbs. In New Hartford, the route has an exit with Genesee Street prior to meeting NY 5 and NY 12 at a cloverleaf interchange southwest of downtown Utica. While the right-of-way of NY 8 continues to the northeast through the cloverleaf as NY 840, NY 8 joins NY 5 and NY 12 as the three routes enter downtown on the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial. The Utica Arterial under construction in May 2015 Near the northern edge of downtown, NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12 interchange with NY 5A and NY 5S on the southern bank of the Mohawk River. At the exit, the three state routes are joined on the arterial by I-790, which follows NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12 across the Mohawk River and the neighboring Erie Canal to a large interchange north of the canal. Here, I-790 and NY 5 separate from the concurrency while NY 8 and NY 12 remain concurrent into Deerfield as a limited-access highway. After an interchange with a former routing of NY 12, NY 8 separates from the highway and returns to an at-grade roadway as it heads northeast to Poland. Near the Oneida-Herkimer County line (here delimited by West Canada Creek), NY 8 merges with NY 28 and follows the route across the county line (as well as the creek) into Poland. In the center of the village, NY 8 splits from NY 28 and heads northeast into Adirondack Park. =Adirondack Park= NY 8 approaching I-87 Within Adirondack Park, NY 8 follows a northeast‚Äìsouthwest routing as it crosses the lower half of the park. Near Ohio, NY 8 intersects NY 365 due north of where it enters the park. Past NY 365, NY 8 heads east to Higgins Bay, where it intersects the northern terminus of NY 10\\\\. The route continues northeast to Speculator, where it meets NY 30\\\\. NY 30 turns east onto NY 8, forming an overlap southeast to Wells, where NY 8 separates from NY 30 and heads to the northeast into Warren County. Formerly, NY 8 became an east-west highway near Speculator, but was re-signed around 2010 to north-south to be consistent with the other sections of the highway. In Wevertown, NY 8 intersects NY 28 for the final time prior to meeting US 9 at Loon Lake. The two routes merge, forming an overlap east to Chestertown, where US 9 splits from NY 8 and continues south. NY 8, however, heads east, meeting I-87 shortly after departing US 9\\\\. Past I-87, NY 8 follows the southern edge of Brant Lake to the northeast before turning to the east toward Hague, where it terminates at NY 9N. History =Origins and terminus changes= NY 23 eastbound at NY 8 in South New Berlin In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 8 was assigned to most of its current alignment from Deposit to Hague.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering The route also extended eastward to Wright (southeast of Ticonderoga) on modern NY 9N, NY 22, and County Route 2 (CR 2), where it connected to VT F-10 by way of a ferry across Lake Champlain. From Clayville to Utica, NY 8 was originally routed along Oneida Street before overlapping with NY 5 and NY 12 along Genesee Street in downtown Utica. After crossing the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal, the three routes separated at the intersection of Herkimer Road, Trenton Road, and Coventry Avenue northeast of downtown. NY 8 then followed Coventry Avenue and Walker Road northeast to Deerfield, where NY 8 joined its modern alignment. Prior to 1930, what became NY 8 in the renumbering carried multiple designations along its routing. In 1924, the segment of Genesee Street in Utica that became NY 8 was designated as part of NY 5 and NY 12\\\\. Additionally, the portion of NY 8 from Wevertown to Chestertown became part of NY 10\\\\. The segment from the modern intersection of US 9 and NY 8 to Chestertown was also designated as part of NY 6. By 1926, what became NY 8 from Sidney to New Berlin and from Bridgewater to downtown Utica was designated as NY 44\\\\. Between New Berlin and Bridgewater, NY 44 followed what is now NY 80 through Edmeston to West Burlington and NY 51 from West Burlington to US 20\\\\. It continued west to Bridgewater by way of an overlap with US 20\\\\. From Utica to Wells, the 1930 routing of NY 8 was part of NY 54, which continued south from Wells to Fonda via modern NY 30 and NY 30A. Between Chestertown and Ticonderoga, NY 8 was designated NY 47. Until the renumbering, what became NY 8 was unbuilt from Deposit to Masonville and unnumbered from Masonville to Sidney. Additionally, the segments from New Berlin to Bridgewater and from Wells to Wevertown were unnumbered. NY 8 was rerouted by 1933 to exit Ticonderoga to the east, using what is now NY 74 to reach Lake Champlain instead. At the lake, NY 8 connected to VT F-9 via the Fort Ticonderoga‚ÄìLarrabees Point Ferry. The route was realigned again to follow NY 9N and NY 22 north from Ticonderoga to south of Port Henry, where NY 8 turned northeast to follow what is now NY 185 to the Champlain Bridge. The route became VT 17 on the opposite lakeshore. NY 8 was truncated to Hague , eliminating its overlaps with NY 9N and NY 22. The 2017 route log erroneously shows that NY 8's southern terminus at what is the northern terminus of the overlap with NY 10. =Relocations and realignments= In the early 1950s, construction began on a new arterial highway‚Äîknown as the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial‚Äîthrough downtown Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY 5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964; however, NY 8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway. In the mid-1960s, plans were made to construct a new limited-access highway along the NY 8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford, where it would connect with the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial. The freeway was constructed and completed in the early 1970s. NY 8 was realigned to follow the highway to New Hartford, from where it continued through Utica on the Arterial and I-790. It rejoined its previous alignment at I-790's interchange with Genesee Street. During this same period, the section of NY 12 between Deerfield and South Trenton was moved onto a new freeway built adjacent to NY 12's original alignment. A connector between NY 12 and NY 8 by way of the Miller Road corridor was built at this time. NY 8 was rerouted in the mid-1970s to follow NY 12 north to its exit with the connector. Here, NY 8 left NY 12 and continued east on the connector to rejoin its original alignment at Walker Road. Ownership and maintenance of NY 8's former routing north of the Utica city limits was transferred to Oneida County, which designated the highway as CR 92. Originally NY 8 traveled through the village of Sidney and had a brief overlap with NY 7\\\\. In the 1970s a new alignment was built to the south of Sidney which connected to the new I-88 interchange. In April 2014 work began on a $68.3 million project to replace the viaduct over Columbia Street, Lafayette Streets, and Oriskany Boulevard (NY 5A and NY 5S) in Utica.

In addition to the replacement of the viaduct, the alignment of the arterial was straightened, a new single point urban interchange was built at Court Street, and a pedestrian bridge was built across the roadway.

A homa is sometimes called a \\"sacrifice ritual\\" because the fire destroys the offering, but a homa is more accurately a \\"votive ritual\\". The fire is the agent, and the offerings include those that are material and symbolic such as grains, clarified butter, milk, incense and seeds. It is rooted in the Vedic religion, and was adopted in ancient times by Buddhism and Jainism. The practice spread from India to Central Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Homa rituals remain an important part of many Hindu ceremonies, and variations of homa continue to be practiced in current-day Buddhism, particularly in parts of Tibet and Japan. It is also found in modern Jainism. A homa ritual is known by alternative names, such as yajna in Hinduism which sometimes means larger public fire rituals, or jajnavidhana or goma in Buddhism. In modern times, a homa or havana (also havan) tends to be a private ritual around a symbolic fire, such as those observed at a wedding. Etymology The Sanskrit word homa (‡§π‡•ã‡§Æ) is from the root hu, which refers to \\"pouring into fire, offer, sacrifice\\".Hu, Sanskrit- English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany History Homa traditions are found all across Asia, from Samarkand to Japan, over a 3000-year history. A homa, in all its Asian variations, is a ceremonial ritual that offers food to fire and is ultimately linked to the traditions contained in the Vedic religion. The tradition reflects a reverence for fire and cooked food (pƒÅkayaj√±a) that developed in Asia, and the Brahmana layers of the Vedas are the earliest records of this ritual reverence. The yaj√±ƒÅ or fire sacrifice became a distinct feature of the early ≈õruti rituals. A ≈õrauta ritual is a form of quid pro quo where through the fire ritual, a sacrificer offered something to the gods and goddesses, and the sacrificer expected something in return. The Vedic ritual consisted of sacrificial offerings of something edible or drinkable, such as milk, clarified butter, yoghurt, rice, barley, an animal, or anything of value, offered to the gods with the assistance of fire priests. This Vedic tradition split into ≈õrauta (≈õruti-based) and Smarta (Sm·πõti-based). The homa ritual practices were observed by different Buddhist and Jaina traditions, states Phyllis Granoff, with their texts appropriating the \\"ritual eclecticism\\" of Hindu traditions, albeit with variations that evolved through medieval times.Phyllis Granoff (2000), Other people's rituals: Ritual Eclecticism in early medieval Indian religious, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 28, Issue 4, pages 399-424 The homa-style Vedic sacrifice ritual, states Musashi Tachikawa, was absorbed into Mahayana Buddhism and homa rituals continue to be performed in some Buddhist traditions in Tibet, China and Japan. Hinduism The homa ritual grammar is common to many sanskara (rite of passage) ceremonies in various Hindu traditions. The Vedic fire ritual, at the core of various homa ritual variations in Hinduism, is a \\"bilaterally symmetrical\\" structure of a rite. It often combines fire and water, burnt offerings and soma, fire as masculine, earth and water as feminine, the fire vertical and reaching upwards, while the altar, offerings and liquids being horizontal. The homa ritual's altar (fire pit) is itself a symmetry, most often a square, a design principle that is also at the heart of temples and mandapas in Indian religions. The sequence of homa ritual events similarly, from beginning to end, are structured around the principles of symmetry. ). The fire-altar (vedi or homa/havan kunda) is generally made of brick or stone or a copper vessel, and is almost always built specifically for the occasion, being dismantled immediately afterwards. This fire-altar is invariably built in square shape. While very large vedis are occasionally built for major public homas, the usual altar may be as small as 1 √ó 1 foot square and rarely exceeds 3 √ó 3 feet square. A ritual space of homa, the altar is temporary and movable. The first step in a homa ritual is the construction of the ritual enclosure (mandapa), and the last step is its deconstruction. The altar and mandapa is consecrated by a priest, creating a sacred space for the ritual ceremony, with recitation of mantras. With hymns sung, the fire is started, offerings collected. The sacrificer enters, symbolically cleanses himself or herself, with water, joins the homa ritual, gods invited, prayers recited, conch shell blown. The sacrificers pour offerings and libations into the fire, with hymns sung, to the sounds of svaha. The oblations and offerings typically consist of clarified butter (ghee), milk, curd, sugar, saffron, grains, coconut, perfumed water, incense, seeds, petals and herbs. The altar and the ritual is a symbolic representation of the Hindu cosmology, a link between reality and the worlds of gods and living beings. The ritual is also a symmetric exchange, a \\"quid pro quo\\", where humans offer something to the gods through the medium of fire, and in return expect that the gods will reciprocate with strength and that which they have power to influence. Buddhism The homa (, goma) ritual of consecrated fire is found in some Buddhist traditions of Tibet, China and Japan. Its roots are the Vedic ritual, it evokes Buddhist deities, and is performed by qualified Buddhist priests. In Chinese translations of Buddhist texts such as Kutadanta Sutta, Dighanikaya and Suttanipata, dated to be from the 6th to 8th century, the Vedic homa practice is attributed to Buddha's endorsement along with the claim that Buddha was the original teacher of the Vedas in his previous lives. In some Buddhist homa traditions, such as in Japan, the central deity invoked in this ritual is usually AcalanƒÅtha (Fud≈ç My≈ç≈ç ‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéã, lit. immovable wisdom king). AcalanƒÅtha is another name for the god Rudra in the Vedic tradition, for Vajrapani or Chakdor in Tibetan traditions, and of Sotshirvani in Siberia. The Acala Homa ritual procedure follows the same Vedic protocols found in Hinduism, with offerings into the fire by priests who recite mantras being the main part of the ritual and the devotees clap hands as different rounds of hymns have been recited. Other versions of the Vedic homa (goma) rituals are found in the Tendai and Shingon Buddhist traditions as well as in Shugend≈ç and Shinto in Japan. In most Shingon temples, this ritual is performed daily in the morning or the afternoon, and is a requirement for all acharyas to learn this ritual upon entering the priesthood. The original medieval era texts of the goma rituals are in Siddham Sanskrit seed words and Chinese, with added Japanese katakana to assist the priests in proper pronunciation. Larger scale ceremonies often include multiple priests, chanting, the beating of Taiko drums and blowing of conch shell (horagai) around the mandala with fire as the ceremonial focus. Homa rituals (sbyin sreg) widely feature in Tibetan Buddhism and B√∂n and are linked to a variety of Mahayana Buddhas and tantric deities. Jainism Homa rituals are also found in Jainism. For example, the Ghantakarn ritual is a homa sacrifice, which has evolved over the centuries, and where ritual offerings are made into fire, with pancamrit (milk, curd, sugar, saffron and clarified butter) and other symbolic items such as coconut, incense, seeds and herbs. The mantra recited by Jains include those in Sanskrit, and the 16th-century Svetambara text Ghantakarna Mantra Stotra is a Sanskrit text which describes the homa ritual dedicated to Ghantakarna Mahavira in one of the Jaina sects. The Adipurana of Jainism, in section 47.348, describes a Vedic fire ritual in the memory of Rishabha. Traditional Jaina wedding ceremonies, like among the Hindus, is a Vedic fire sacrifice ritual.

The shares of companies with a market capitalization of less than $50 million are typically referred to as nano-cap stocks. Many micro-cap and nano-cap stocks are traded over-the- counter with their prices quoted on the OTCBB, OTC Link LLC, or the Pink Sheets. The larger, more established micro-caps are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market or American Stock Exchange (AMEX). Microcap stocks are in many ways different from other stocks since they are from companies with a small market capitalization and are usually traded on stock exchanges that do not require minimum standards, such as a minimum amount of net assets or a minimum number of stock holders.SEC: Microcap Stock: A Guide for Investors Sec.gov, Retrieved: July 26, 2014. In addition, these micro cap stock companies often have fewer resources to make their information available to the public. These micro cap stocks are less likely to be published and talked about by stockbrokers compared to larger public companies. Often, microcap stock companies will specialize in innovative products or services that may be unknown to the general public. Micro-cap and especially nano-cap stocks can sometimes experience volatility. Some of these companies fail to execute their business plans and go out of business. Fraud and market manipulation are not uncommon and the transaction costs in trading can be quite high. Pricing is more likely to be inefficient, since fewer institutional investors and analysts operate in this space, due to the relatively small dollar amounts involved and the lack of liquidity. Investors and finance experts have proposed microcaps can be good investments. David Maley of Ariel Investments argues that ample evidence indicates holding a portion of a portfolio in micro-cap stocks can offer advantages. Micro-caps as a group tend to out- perform stocks from larger companies over time, Daley notes, and micro-caps are not closely correlated with larger company stocks or index funds and thus potentially offset broader market volatility. Furthermore, micro-caps being relatively neglected by analysts offers more potential opportunities for value investors.David Maley (n.d.) The Case for Micro-Cap Equities. ArielInvestments.com, accessed 2020-08-01 Similarly, professor Jeremy J. Siegel of Wharton School of Business notes in his book Stocks for the Long Run how a review of American stock data from 1926 to 1996 found that the smallest quintile of stocks by capitalization (including micro-caps) outperformed the largest quintile by an average of almost 4% per year. But this over- performance was not consistent, with multi-year stretches of time when smaller company stocks under-performed relative to larger company stock.Siegel, Jeremy J. (1994, 1998).

Meykhana is often compared to hip hop music, also known as national rap among Azerbaijani residents, as it also includes performers that is spoken lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat. Performers also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Meykhana masters may write, memorize, or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat. Etymology The name of this genre comes from the traditional Persian meykhane (tavern, pub), which itself originated from the Persian word mey (wine) and khane (house). The professional performers of meykhana are known as the S√∂z Ustadƒ± (Word Masters) in Azeri, also called as the meykhana masters. History =Origins (1920‚Äì1940)= Since medieval times, meyhanes were places where poets would gather exchanging verses in an extemporaneous fashion, sometimes joking and disparaging one another.

Although during the Soviet period meykhana was banned, the poetry of Aliagha Vahid was often rhymed as a contemporary meykhana.\\"Meyxana\\", ya \\"b…ôdih…ô\\" s√∂z√º al…ômi bir-birin…ô qatƒ±b B…ôdah…ôt…ôn deyilm…ôy…ôn meyxananƒ± q…ôbul etmirik ‚Äì meyxana ustalarƒ± This could be related to the meykhana's popularity among the residents of Baku and Absheron regions. =Popular acceptance (1991‚Äì2001)= After Soviet Union's downfall, meykhana found mainstream acceptance in Azerbaijan, though many fundamentalists still protested the genre, saying that it was still too liberal and in contrast to traditional national values. They claimed the musical genre still promoted sexuality, alcohol, drugs and Western consumer culture, but critics of the fundamentalist viewpoint stated that fundamentalists and meykhana musicians were ultimately seeking converts from the same population, the youth, who often had to choose where they belonged between the two cultures.Azerbaijan's Own Ancient Version of Rap Reappears New performers emerged in this era with their distinctive takes on meykhana: Aghasalim Childagh, Kabir Azeri, Aghamirza Mammadov, Aghakarim Novruzov, Elchin Mashtagaly and Mashadibaba Aydamirov started the meykhana wave, combining Azerbaijani national music-influenced meykhana music with electronic music. Nizami Ramzi was first meykhana master to be ever performed in national television and in popular movies. =Contemporary mainstream meykhana (2001‚Äìpresent)= As the 90s progressed, meykhana's sound became more standardized as newer performers drew inspiration for the same collective set of influences that included Aydin Khirdalanli, Rashad Daghly, Elshan Khazar, Vahid Gadim, Mahir Ju'rat, Oktay, Vugar Mashtagaly and Namig Mana. Namig Garachukhurlu, in particular, with its romantic dissonance and duos with Azerbaijani pop singers like Aygun Kazimova, created the sonic template for a new movement, which became known as popular music-meykhana songs. However, this produced division among meykhana performers. The fundamentalist meykhana performers decided to keep the classical style which they have used through last decades, while the new wave of meykhana performers decided to combine meykhana with different musical genres. With the increased popularity of meykhana in the 1990s and the 2000s, television channels started broadcasting and creating meykhana tournaments. The television programs such as De, G…ôlsin! (Say, Come On!) in ANS TV led meykhana to popularize even more among local residents and demand for meykhana increased significantly in Azerbaijani weddings.

Enunciation is essential to a flowing meykhana couplets; some meykhana masters choose also to exaggerate it for comic and artistic effect. Breath control, taking in air without interrupting one's delivery, is an important skill for a meykhana performer to master. Meykhana couplets are always delivered with melody. The ability to compose quickly, meaningful and clearly meykhana couplets is regarded as an important sign of skill. Social impact The nationwide popularity of meykhana music meant that it became a major influence on culture, fashion and social attitudes. Different subgenres of meykhana were adopted by, and became central to, the identity of a large number of sub-cultures. These reforms also laid the foundation of the modern Azerbaijani hip hop, who adopted meykhana style, respectively in the 1990s.Dayirman - Rap Music for a New Generation Since its early development meykhana has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most obviously in early meykhana music's rejection of a government dominated culture, the counter-culture's rejection of consumerism of all forms of social convention.DAYIRMAN: COMBINING RAP, TRADITION, AND FRUSTRATION IN AZERBAIJAN On 30 May 2012, an anti-Putin Twitter message started trending worldwide after opposition activists posted a hashtag \\"Putin, who are you?

Currently located in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, New York, its mission is to educate and place rabbis who are ‚Äúopen, non-judgmental, knowledgeable, empathetic, and eager to transform Orthodoxy into a movement that meaningfully and respectfully interacts with all Jews, regardless of affiliation, commitment, or background.‚Äù Its core values include a passionate commitment to the study of Torah and the scrupulous observance of halakha (Jewish Law); intellectual openness and critical thinking in one's religious life; expanding the role of women; commitment to the broader Jewish community; and a responsibility to improve the world and to care for every human being in it, regardless of faith. YCT's rabbinic education program combines a classic curriculum in Tanakh, Talmud, and the codes of Jewish law with a program in pastoral counseling, leadership retreats, and education in fund-raising and other realities of contemporary religious leadership.\\"Opening Up Orthodox Judaism\\" The Jewish Week, December 12, 2007 YCT ordained its first graduating class of rabbis in June 2004 and has continued to do so every June since.

In addition to its rabbinical studies program, the yeshiva offers a public Jewish educational program, in association with the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, at its Riverdale campus in the Bronx, New York. YCT also runs a variety of events open to the entire Jewish community, including its annual yemei iyun (\\"study days\\") on Bible and Jewish Thought and a public lecture series. Since its inception, YCT has struggled in gaining wide support from the Orthodox community. The Rabbinical Council of America does not accept YCT's semikhah for membership,\\"Orthodox Rabbis Eye Liberal Seminary\\" The Forward April 7, 2006 and Agudath Israel of America has declared Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Yeshivat Maharat, Open Orthodoxy, and other affiliated entities to be outside of the bounds of Orthodoxy.  History  The origins of Yeshiva Chovevei Torah go back to 1996, when Rabbis Avi Weiss and Saul Berman founded a program known as MeORoT (Modern Orthodox Rabbinic Training) which provided supplemental lectures on issues in Modern Orthodoxy to rabbinical students then enrolled in Yeshiva University. The fellowship at that time was co- sponsored by Yeshiva University, Edah and Weiss's synagogue, the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale. In the following year, 1997, Weiss added the Torat Miriam Fellowship to the MeORoT program, inviting women involved in Jewish Studies on the graduate level to participate in these lectures. In September 1999, Weiss and Rabbi Dov Linzer launched Yeshivat Chovevei Torah as an undergraduate learning program primarily for students in Columbia University and Barnard College. The YCT University Program had Rabbi Linzer serving as its Rosh HaYeshiva and was housed at Congregation Ramath Orah, a Modern Orthodox congregation on 110th Street in Manhattan. The faculty consisted of three recent graduates of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) affiliated with Yeshiva University: Rabbi Dov Weiss, who also directed the program, Rabbi Barry Wimpfheimer, and Rabbi Ari Perl. In January 2000, the leadership of the YCT university program, which consisted of Rabbis Avi Weiss, Saul Berman, Dov Linzer and Dov Weiss decided to create a rabbinical school which would officially open in September 2000. In September 2000, the rabbinical school welcomed its first class of 7 students. In January 2004, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah moved from its location in Ramath Orah to the Abraham Joshua Heschel High School on 60th Street and West End Avenue and then to the Kraft Center/Columbia Barnard Hillel on 115th Street in July 2005. After spending five full years at the Columbia Hillel, the school then left Manhattan in the summer of 2010, moving to the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, where it is at present. Controversies over YCT came to a head when in 2006 YCT applied for membership in the Rabbinical Council of America, the rabbinical body affiliated with the Orthodox Union, the largest North American Modern and Centrist Orthodox body. YCT subsequently withdrew their application when it became apparent that the application would be denied. Having ordained 27 rabbis as of June 2006, the count nearly doubled by June 2009 to 54, who, not being eligible for RCA membership, can join the International Rabbinic Fellowship, an organization co-founded in 2008 by Rabbis Avi Weiss and Marc Angel.http://jta.org/news/article/2008/02/26/107206/angleweiss = Open Orthodoxy = In the first 15 years of its history, YCT described itself as an Open Orthodox institution, and its mission statement made heavy use of the term that its founder Rabbi Avi Weiss had coined. However, the term provoked harsh criticism. At a May 2014 gala, one member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, called Open Orthodoxy heretical. In the fall of 2015, the Agudath Israel of America, an Ultra Orthodox rabbinical group, called Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Yeshivat Maharat, Open Orthodoxy, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. And in 2016, An op- ed in the Jewish Press strongly condemned the school, calling the philosophy \\"unorthodox\\" and suggesting its adherents \\"heretics\\". Since then, YCT has distanced itself from the term. The school has removed all references to Open Orthodoxy on its website, replacing \\"open\\" with \\"modern.\\" In an interview with The Jewish Week in August 2017, Rabbi Asher Lopatin, the school's then- president said: ‚ÄúWhen they say, ‚ÄòOpen Orthodox,‚Äô I say, ‚ÄòWe are Modern Orthodox. We are a full part of Modern Orthodoxy.‚Äô‚Äù  Curriculum and pastoral counseling program  Like classical Orthodox Rabbinic ordination programs, YCT's curriculum has a strong focus on Talmud and Halakha with particular emphasis on the areas of Sabbath observance, dietary laws, laws of family life, and mourning. YCT's curriculum is also supplemented by a strong focus in Bible and Jewish thought. YCT states that the classical approaches to subject matters are complemented with academic and innovative methodologies. Their stated goal is to create knowledgeable, broadminded and critical-thinking Torah scholars, halakhic decision-makers and spiritual leaders. One of the more innovative areas of YCT's curriculum is an unprecedented emphasis on pastoral care and professional development. Whereas it is common in other rabbinical schools to offer a semester or a year of pastoral counseling courses, YCT's program spans the entire four-year curriculum. The pastoral counseling program is taught by leading psychiatric professionals, and includes formal classroom instruction, role-playing, clinical experience and mentored field work. The program places particular emphasis on topics that rabbis regularly encounter: religious doubt and personal change; rites of passage; adolescence; substance abuse; marital and family problems; sexual function and dysfunction; homosexuality; domestic violence; loss, tragedy and bereavement; and response to catastrophe. The first-year courses are organized around basic principles of counseling. The second-year courses follow the life cycle, giving an overview of normal development as well as addressing potential difficulties. In their third and fourth years, students take seminars in chaplaincy, marital and family therapy, and psychology and religion. Fieldwork with direct clinical supervision is an essential part of the curriculum. In their third and fourth years, students rotate through an intensive chaplaincy program and meet regularly with senior clinicians to discuss pastoral issues that arise during their internships. One of the other hallmarks of the YCT pastoral counseling program is the introduction of the process group. A common feature of graduate psychology programs, a process group consists of the students from a given class year who meet weekly with a mental health professional throughout the full four years of the program. In this completely confidential setting, students are free to explore issues of faith, authority, training, personal situation, etc.  Faculty and administration  Rabbi Dov Linzer has served as YCT's president from January 2018 ‚Äì present, having succeeded Rabbi Asher Lopatin whose tenure lasted from July 2013 ‚Äì July 2018 and who was the school's second president, following Rabbi Avi Weiss. YCT's faculty is headed by Rabbi Dov Linzer, the Rosh HaYeshiva. Other faculty members include Rabbi Ysoscher Katz, Rabbi Nathaniel Helfgot, Rabbi Chaim Marder, Miriam Schacter and Dr. Michelle Friedman. On 21 October 2007, Linzer was installed as the dean of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, taking over from Weiss. Rabbi Jon Kelsen is the current dean, while Linzer serves as President and Rosh Yeshiva.  Student body and alumni  When the rabbinical school was founded, its first class had only 7 members. However, after what Yeshiva University's student newspaper, The Commentator, called in 2002 an \\"aggressive marketing campaign,‚Äù many young men who previously would have considered YU's rabbinical school are now attending YCT. A 2007 YU Commentator article reported YCT's enrollment to be 43 full-time students.Jan. 22, by Zev Eleff The first rabbi was ordained in 2003. According to a 2006 news article, YCT graduates about 10 students a year, and in a 2009 story it was reported that there were 54 total YCT graduates. As of 2019, YCT has ordained over 130 rabbis serving throughout the US and around the world, who serve in synagogues, on college campus, as teachers and administrators, chaplains, religious entrepreneurs; leaders of Jewish institutions, and more.  Absorption of EDAH functions  In July 2006, YCT officials announced that they would absorb some of the personnel and functions of the Modern Orthodox advocacy organization EDAH, which had announced its closure and became defunct.\\"Modern Orthodox Think Tank to Fold, The Jewish Week, June 30, 2006 YCT assumed EDAH's journal, website, and audio-visual library. The school also took on EDAH's founding director, Rabbi Saul Berman, for a position as Director of Continuing Rabbinic Education.R. Saul Berman, \\"The Emergence, Role, and Closing of Edah.\\" The Jewish Week, July 12, 2006.  Gender  Yeshivat Chovevei Torah does not admit female students.http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/09/07/3106226/can-asher-lopatin- secure-yeshivat-chovevei-torahs-place-in-orthodox-judaism Yeshivat Maharat, also started by Avi Weiss, accepts female students for ordination.  Role of women in Judaism  Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, (Yeshivat Maharat notwithstanding), accepts only male candidates for ordination. However, YCT, unlike a number of rabbis and institutions within Orthodox Judaism, has promoted expanded roles for women in ritual life and religious leadership. Founder Avi Weiss explained: > \\"Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Rabbinical School, as an Orthodox institution, > requires that its students daven only in synagogues with mechitzot > [partitions for the separation of men and women]. The phenomenon of women > receiving aliyot in a mechitza minyan is currently being debated on both a > halachic and communal level within the Modern Orthodox community. YCT > Rabbinical School does not currently take a position on this issue.\\"\\"Gender > Taboos Fall at New Orthodox Prayer Services\\", Forward, September 20, 2002 In June 2009, Weiss created the title MaHaRaT for Sara Hurwitz. He expressed his desire to have called her a rabbi, stating \\"She can do 95 percent of what other rabbis do\\".\\"Between A Rav And A Hard Place\\" , The Jewish Week, June 24, 2009. She was later titled \\"Rabba\\", a feminine version of the word \\"rabbi\\", despite female rabbis in other movements being called \\"rabbi\\". This led to complaints from the RCA, which led to Weiss stating he would not name future graduates as \\"rabba\\". Weiss subsequently resigned from the RCA. However, Yeshivat Maharat, which Weiss founded, allows its ordainees to choose their own titles, and in 2015 ordained Yaffa Epstein took the title Rabba. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained by that same organization, and chose for herself the title Rabbi, making her their first graduate to take that title.  Criticism  Many other Orthodox groups have criticized YCT for theological positions they believe are inconsistent with traditional values. The Modern Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America does not accept the school's ordination as valid for membership. In the fall of 2015, the Agudath Israel of America denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Yeshivat Maharat, Open Orthodoxy, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.

Formed during World War II, it served until 1994, when it was deactivated during the post Cold War drawdown. Battalions of the Ninth Marine Regiment, but not the regiment itself, were reactivated from 2007 to 2014 as part of the Marine Corps' growth during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The battalions have subsequently been deactivated again. Subordinate units The regiment was composed of three infantry battalions and the regimental headquarters company: * Headquarters Company, 9th Marines (HQ/9) * 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) * 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines (2/9) * 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines (3/9) History =Early years= The 9th Marines were activated at Quantico, Virginia, on November 20, 1917. A month later, they deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and were attached to the 3rd Marine Brigade. That same month, they redeployed with the brigade to Galveston, Texas, in case of any German operation in the Caribbean or in Mexico. After World War I, the regiment was deactivated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on April 25, 1919. On December 1, 1925, the regiment was reactivated as a reserve organization whose mission was to train and maintain at a high degree of preparedness a group of ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù Marines. =World War II= The 3rd Battalion 9th Marines was reactivated at Camp Elliot, San Diego on February 12, 1942. In the following months, the rest of the battalions were also reactivated on January 1, 1942, when the regiment officially re-formed. They were attached to the 3rd Marine Division at Camp Pendleton on September 16, 1943. The 9th Marines fought as part of the 3rd Marine Division on the islands of Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima during WW2. The regiment was inactivated at Camp Pendleton on December 31, 1945. =Post World War II= The regiment was reformed on 17 March 1952 at Camp Pendleton, California and assigned to the 3d Marine Division. It was deployed during August 1953 to Camp Gifu, Japan and then in June 1955 to Okinawa. The regiment alternated between Japan and Okinawa in the 1950s. =Vietnam War= On March 8, 1965, 9th Marines came ashore at Red Beach as the first conventional ground combat unit in South Vietnam, their mission was to defend the Da Nang Air Base. The first significant contact was in April 1965. The regimental headquarters arrived in country in July of that year. The regiment saw action in Vietnam‚Äôs I Corps, primarily in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Th·ª´a Thi√™n Provinces, although a number of its earlier operations were also conducted in the southern I Corps provinces of Qu·∫£ng Nam, Qu·∫£ng T√≠n and Qu·∫£ng Ngai. The 9th Marines served as a vital stop to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) penetrations across the DMZ and from along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. Some of its early operations included Operation Double Eagle, Macon and Prairie. In April and May 1967, elements of the regiment defeated two PAVN regiments in The Hill Fights north of Khe Sanh Combat Base. In Operation Buffalo, elements of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines made contact north of Con Thien with regimental-size PAVN forces in an engagement that lasted through May, accounting for over 1300 enemy dead. The regiment successfully conducted Operation Dewey Canyon in the A Shau Valley. The 9th Regiment killed many PAVN, preventing another build-up and assault from Route 622 from Laos into South Vietnam as the PAVN had the year before during the Tet Offensive. Operation Dewey Canyon netted, among other weaponry, 16 artillery pieces, 73 anti-aircraft guns, hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, 92 trucks, and hundreds of thousands pounds of rice. This operation earned the regiment an Army Presidential Unit Citation. General Richard G. Stilwell wrote in his report to COMUSMACV General Creighton Abrams on Operation Dewey Canyon: ‚Äú...this ranks with the most significant undertakings of the Vietnam conflict in the concept and results...‚Äù The 9th Marines were part of the first redeployments from Vietnam in the summer of 1969. In July 1969 the regiment deployed to Camp Schwab, Okinawa and was reassigned in August 1969 to the 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade. The 9th MAB was then reassigned during November 1969 to the 3rd Marine Division (3 MarDiv). =Inactivation (1994)= The 9th Marines were inactivated in the budget cuts of 1994.Melson, Charles (1998). US Marine in Vietnam (1965-1973); Warrior Series #23. London: Osprey Military, a division of Reed Publishing Ltd. p.62 A nucleus of staff and support personnel were maintained to reconstitute the regiment when needed. This was done in the belief that the necessary riflemen would be easily recruited in time of emergency or war. On September 2, 1994, the 2nd Battalion was inactivated and redesignated the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines and the 3rd Battalion was inactivated and re-designated the 3d Battalion, 4th Marines. On September 9, 1994, the 1st Battalion was inactivated and redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines. =Reactivation (2007)= As part of the effort to expand the Marine Corps to 202,000 Marines by the end of 2011, the battalions of the 9th Marines began reactivation in 2007. The 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) reactivated on April 18, 2007, the 2nd Battalion reactivated in July 2007, and the 3rd Battalion reactivated in May 2008.

Malawski was under a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) contract from 2006 to 2007, but never made it past the developmental system. In May 2008, Malawski joined TNA and would go on to become a one-time TNA Women's Knockout Champion and a two-time TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champion with her partners Sarita and Hamada, while also becoming the first wrestler to have held both titles. After departing from TNA in December 2010, Malawski announced her retirement from professional wrestling and wrestled her final match on February 5, 2011. Professional wrestling career =Early years (2003‚Äì2006)= Malawski made her professional debut in June 2003 at the age of 17 under the name Shantelle Taylor. In 2004, she was featured in the two-part wrestling documentary, Slam Bam, which aired on the Discovery Channel. In 2005, she won her first women's championship while competing in New Vision Pro Wrestling. She spent the summer of that year in Monterrey, Mexico working on her lucha libre style. In December she participated in a three-show tour of South Africa wrestling on a card that featured former World Wrestling Entertainment stars Kevin Nash, Andrew Martin and Scott Steiner. Also in December, she was invited to a tryout in Buffalo, New York for World Wrestling Entertainment. Malawski also worked for several independent wrestling promotions including Shimmer Women Athletes, Ring Divas' Battle Angels, Twin Wrestling Entertainment, and Blood Sweat and Ears. On April 16, 2006, Malawski defeated Traci Brooks to become the inaugural Battle Angels Women's Champion. Malawski also spent time working the Pure Women's Action shows for the Pure Wrestling Association in Southern Ontario. =World Wrestling Entertainment= Deep South Wrestling (2006‚Äì2007) In May 2006, Malawski signed a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment and was assigned to their developmental territory Deep South Wrestling. She made her Deep South in-ring debut at the June 27, 2006 TV tapings as simply Shantelle, where she lost against Krissy Vaine. On September 9, 2006, Malawski defeated Vaine at Deep South Wrestling Grand Park Slam event in Six Flags Over Georgia. On the October 26, 2006 episode of DSW TV Tapings, Taylor defeated Angel Williams after a distraction from Tracy Taylor and again on the November 2 episode. In January 2007, Malawski appeared on the SmackDown!/ECW house shows as San-Eye, a masked Japanese wrestler, where she wrestled Jamie Noble. In June 2007, Malawski wrestled in dark matches prior to the SmackDown! television tapings while wearing a mask including a bout where she defeated Jillian Hall. On the January 18 episode of DSW TV Tapings, Shantelle teamed up with Williams to defeat Taylor and Luscious. On the January 19 episode of DSW TV Taping, Taylor continued her feud with Williams where she defeated Williams. On the January 25 episode of DSW TV Tapings, Taylor teamed up with Kofi Kingston to defeat Brian Cage and Williams. In March 2007, Taylor would gain an ally in Nattie Neidhart where they feud with Williams and Vaine in various tag team and singles matches. At the DSW Park Slam pay-per-view on March 17, 2007, Taylor teamed up with Neidhart in a winning effort, defeating Vaine and Williams. On the March 22 episode of DSW TV Tapings, Taylor teamed up with Eric Perez in a winning effort defeating Williams and Cru Jones in a mixed tag-team match. On the April 12 episode of DSW TV Tapings, Taylor teamed up with Neidhart to defeat Krissy Vaine and Angel Williams to end their feud. Florida Championship Wrestling (2007) When Florida Championship Wrestling opened in 2007, Taylor was transferred there. Taylor made her debut for FCW on the June 26 episode of FCW Television, losing to Neidhart in a triple treat match, also involving Krissy Vaine. On the June 30 episode of FCW Television, Taylor was defeated by Neidhart with Vaine as the special guest referee. On August 13, 2007 Malawski was released from her developmental contract. Following the release, she did not return to the independent circuit and was actually done with professional wrestling until TNA contacted her, as she had concentrated on pursuing a college degree instead. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling= Knockouts Champion (2008) Wilde's autograph Malawski's tryout match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) was against Raisha Saeed. In May 2008, Malawski signed a contract with TNA, making her an official member of the TNA roster. She then appeared on television as a \\"plant\\" on the May 29 episode of Impact!. She responded to the $25,000 challenge from Awesome Kong to any females age 18 or older in the audience, but was not selected to wrestle her. She reappeared in the audience on the June 5 episode of Impact! to challenge Kong, but once again was not selected to wrestle her. On June 19, she challenged Kong in the $25,000 challenge. She was announced under the name Taylor, and despite losing, she was the closest out of any of the contestants to defeating Kong. On the July 3 episode of Impact!, Taylor defeated Raisha Saeed and earned the right to face Kong again the following week in the $25,000 challenge, this time with the TNA Women's Knockout Championship also on the line. The following week, now using the name \\"Taylor Wilde\\", she defeated Kong in the $25,000 challenge and won the championship. Wilde then retained the title in a rematch at Victory Road against Kong. On the July 24 episode of Impact!, Wilde defeated Velvet Sky in five seconds to retain the championship, and when immediately challenged to a rematch, defeated her in 20 seconds. Afterward, Wilde was attacked by the duo of Sky and Angelina Love (known as The Beautiful People) and was given the 'Brown Paper Bag Treatment', before ODB and Gail Kim could make the save. On the September 11 episode of Impact, Wilde beat Love in the first ever \\"Beautiful People Beauty Pageant\\", but was attacked by the Beautiful People, causing Rhino to make the save for a second time. At No Surrender she was accompanied by Rhino when she defeated Love. Wilde won a Triple Threat match at Bound for Glory against Awesome Kong and Roxxi to keep the title. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Wilde lost the championship to Kong after interference from Saeed. Various feuds (2008‚Äì2009) At Turning Point she teamed with Roxxi to defeat Raisha Saeed and Awesome Kong with a Bronco Buster. Continuing her feud with The Beautiful People, Wilde teamed with ODB and Roxxi to defeat them and Sharmell at Final Resolution. At Genesis she teamed once again with Roxxi and ODB to defeat Rhaka Khan, Raisha Saeed and Sojourner Bolt. The next week on Impact! Wilde, Roxxi and ODB defeated the Kongtourage once more. Wilde and Roxxi began feuding with the Beautiful People when Wilde and Roxxi humiliated the Beautiful People by covering them with \\"muck.\\" Soon after Wilde and Roxxi would continue to have series of tag team matches against The Beautiful People. On February 12 she competed in a 9 wrestler Gauntlet match which was won by Sojourner Bolt. At Destination X she teamed with Roxxi and The Governor to defeat The Beautiful People and Madison Rayne in a six-woman tag team match. At Lockdown she competed in a 3 way cage match for the TNA Knockouts Championship against Angelina Love and Awesome Kong, but the match was eventually won by Love. On April 23 she lost a number one contenders ladder match to Sojournor Bolt. Wilde was interviewed on the May 7 edition of Impact, where she told interviewer Lauren that she had received notice of having a secret admirer. The following week, Lauren and Taylor were shown sitting at a table, waiting for the admirer to arrive. Soon, Daffney arrived, attacking and choking Taylor, blaming her for The Beautiful People cutting her hair off, and in the process, challenging her to the first ever Monster's Ball match at Sacrifice, which Wilde won. From the feud with Daffney, it was shown that Wilde is on- screen best friends with backstage interviewer, Lauren. Wilde and her tag team partner Abyss defeated Daffney and Raven in a Monster's Ball match at Slammiversary, thus ending her feud with Daffney. Storyline with Sarita (2009‚Äì2010) Malawski with Sarita at a TNA wrestling event in 2010 In August, Wilde formed an alliance with Sarita after TNA announced that they were going to crown new Knockouts Tag Team Champions. On the September 10 edition of Impact!, Wilde and Sarita advanced the semifinals of the Tag Team Championship tournament by defeating Alissa Flash and Daffney. The following week on Impact!, they advanced to the finals of the tournament by defeating Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed. At No Surrender, Wilde and Sarita defeated Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky to become the inaugural Knockouts Tag Team Champions. This win makes Taylor Wilde the first wrestler in TNA history to win the singles and tag team titles. Wilde and Sarita successfully defended their titles against The Beautiful People at Bound for Glory and at Turning Point teamed with ODB to defeat The Beautiful People and retain both sets of titles. On the January 4, 2010, live, three-hour, Monday night edition of Impact!, Wilde and Sarita lost the Tag Team Championship to Hamada and Awesome Kong. Wilde and Sarita made their return in the March 8 edition of Impact!, unsuccessfully challenging for the vacant Tag Team titles. On the June 25 edition of Xplosion, Wilde defeated Daffney after interference from Sarita, ending the team's long losing streak. On the following week, Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained that she didn't want to win by cheating, which led to Sarita displaying a villainous persona by claiming that she is a winner and, unlike Wilde, doesn't need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde ran out to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. After being defeated by Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne on the July 1 edition of Impact!, Wilde's alliance with Sarita came to an end, when Sarita turned heel and attacked her, proclaiming she was sick of losing matches. Wilde and Sarita faced each other on the following edition of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by holding her trunks. On the July 15 edition of Impact! Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. Alliance with Hamada and departure (2010) On July 27, at the tapings of the August 5 edition of Impact!, Wilde teamed with new tag team partner Hamada to defeat The Beautiful People (Velvet Sky and Lacey Von Erich) to win the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship for the second time. During September, Wilde and Hamada made two successful defenses of their championship, first defeating Lacey Von Erich and Madison Rayne on the September 16 episode of Impact Wrestling, and then Von Erich and Velvet Sky the following week, when Rayne turned on Von Erich. Wilde and Sarita had their third one‚Äìon‚Äìone match at the November 9 tapings of Xplosion, with Sarita once again coming out victorious. On December 6 at the tapings of the December 9 edition of Impact!, Wilde and Hamada were stripped of the Tag Team Championship, after Hamada had been released from TNA. Three days later it was reported that Malawski's contract with TNA had also expired. Malawski confirmed her departure from the promotion on December 29, 2010. =Retirement (2011)= On January 10, 2011, Malawski announced that she was retiring from professional wrestling in order to concentrate on her psychology studies. She wrestled her retirement match on February 5, 2011, at a ChickFight and Pro Wrestling Revolution co‚Äìpromoted event, where she was defeated by Alissa Flash. Personal life Malawski took Psychology courses at York University to complete a Bachelor of Arts Honours Degree while on the road full time with TNA. In 2011, she completed a certificate at Humber College in Pre-Service Firefighter Education and Training. She has been a full time Professional Firefighter since January 5, 2015. She remarried November 18, 2017 to fellow Firefighter David Roynon. The couple had a child on April 20, 2018, named after his mother, Taylor John Roynon.

It was used by the post-Irish Civil War Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Cumann na mBan, (\\"League of Women\\"), along with later incarnations such as the Provisional IRA (PIRA). It includes a statement of military objectives, tactics and conditions for military victory against the British government. This military victory was to be achieved as part of \\"the ongoing liberation of Ireland from foreign occupiers\\". The Green Book has acted as a manual of conduct and induction to the organisation since at least the 1950s. History  Because the IRA and later republican groupings have been identified as illegal organisations (the PIRA, IRA & Cumann na mBan have been proscribed - declared illegal - in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and a number of other countries)The National Archives, Terrorism Act 2000List of proscribed terrorist groups updated by the Home Office in 2016Report of statement outlining legal status of the IRA in the Republic of Ireland by former Minister for Justice and Equality, Michael McDowell in 2005Country Reports on Terrorism 2004 US Department of State report to US Congress the Green Book has been distributed and published secretly. It is published at unknown printing presses and distributed to or shared with IRA volunteers as they are accepted for active duty. Due to this secrecy only two editions of the Green Book have so far been released into the public domain. The first, published in 1956, appears to be intact. The second, publication date unknown but dating to the 1977 detention of then IRA Chief of Staff Seamus Twomey, has only been released in three parts (referred to here as the 1977 edition). With the beginning of the latest IRA ceasefire and the 2005 ending of their campaign, it seems unlikely that a new edition of the manual will have been issued in recent years by the IRA. However, it is possible that known/unknown groupings have issued a more recent version. Volunteers' treatment of the Green Book The Green Book is issued to IRA volunteers as part of their training and is considered a secret document which should not be revealed to, or discussed with non-IRA members. In order to protect the organisation, disclosure of its training material and any other training documents, including the Green Book, would most likely carry stiff penalties up to and including Court Martial. Once issued, each volunteer is expected to study and learn from his/her copy of the manual, to apply the rules given in it, and to apply lessons learnt from it. While the manual is clearly not all the training a volunteer could expect, it gave a broad overview meant to go some way to preparing the volunteer for active duty with the organisation. 1977 and 1956 editions Both known issues of the Green Book were in existence while the IRA, (in the case of the 1956 edition), and the PIRA, (in the case of the 1977 edition), were engaged in a military campaign. In 1956, this was the Border Campaign, in the 1970s it was the guerrilla Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997 which was carried out in Northern Ireland, England & several countries in mainland Europe. Commonalities and differences exist between the two documents. This demonstrates that the Green Book is a living document updated periodically. These updates are made to reflect changes in: *political policy and social structure *military strategy and tactics of the organisation *military strength of the organisation *the technology/tactics of the organisation's enemies While splits in the IRA since 1922 up to the 1950s do not appear to be noted in the 1956 document, developments in the fields of insurgency and counter-insurgency are. Both T. E. Lawrence and Field Marshal Sir William Slim are quoted.T. E. Lawrence is mis-quoted slightly, the quote used is from \\"Evolution of a Revolt\\" available here , the misquote takes place in a section describing the guerrilla as leaving as small a footprint on the battlefield as possible. Lawrence is quoted as saying, \\"the smallest force in the quickest time at the farthest place.\\" The quote from British Chief of the General Staff and Commander of the 14th Army, Field Marshal Sir William Slim used in the Green Book appears on this Official US Army strategy PDF document page 15 The 1977 edition appears to have been more heavily influenced by the work of Brigadier General Frank Kitson. By the 1977 edition, the document had increased in scope, with length remaining around the same. Some doctrinal sections from the 1956 edition were still appearing, while new sections aimed at combating the counter-insurgency efforts of the British Army and RUC had appeared. Notably the 1977 edition would have existed alongside the IRA's change in tactics towards the entirely self-reliant cell structure. The 1956 edition on the other hand discusses the use of the IRA flying column - en masse attacks by large groups of volunteers against concentrations of the enemy. Another notable facet of the 1977 edition is the attention paid to the mental preparation of IRA Volunteers, this being the time of the IRA's \\"Long War\\" strategy. Readers of the 1977 edition are warned: > \\"The Army as an organisation claims and expects your total allegiance > without reservation. It enters into every aspect of your life. It invades > the privacy of your home life, it fragments your family and friends, in > other words claims your total allegiance. All potential volunteers must > realise that the threat of capture and of long jail sentences are a very > real danger and a shadow which hangs over every volunteer...\\" > \\"Another important aspect all potential volunteers should think about is > their ability to obey orders from a superior officer. All volunteers must > obey orders issued to them by a superior officer regardless of whether they > like the particular officer or not\\". The 1956 edition contains no such warning, but appeals to the \\"guerrilla code.\\" In 'Chapter Five - Organisation and Arms', the reader is advised: > \\"Leadership will not come so much by appointment as by the trust the > guerrillas place in their commander. He must be worthy of that trust if he > is to succeed. Instead of discipline of the regular army type there will be > a more stern battle discipline: agreement on the job to be done, and the > need to do it, and obedience to the guerrilla code, these take the place of > the unthinking army type discipline. Breaches of the guerrilla code ‚Äî > desertion, betrayal, breach of confidence in any way ‚Äî must be severely > dealt with on the spot\\". Contents of the Green Book The book contains information on: *political philosophy of the IRA *Irish history in terms of struggle against the occupation of Ireland *the military objectives of the organisation *the military strategy for guerrilla fighters *the military equipment and tools that can be used by guerrilla fighters *the military equipment and training for tools available to the IRA *propaganda techniques within the theatre of operations *interrogation techniques and how to resist them The book has also included references to the training, development, and tactics employed by Regular & Irregular/Specialist forces in modern armies - particularly those of the British Army. Green Book historical context The 1956 document couches the violence and occupation of the island of Ireland in a long history of armed resistance to occupation. The first chapter is entirely taken up with providing this history from the viewpoint of the organisation. It provides information on the Kerne, the battle of the Yellow Ford, Owen Roe O'Neill, the 1798 Rebellion and United Irishmen, James Fintan Lalor, and the \\"Tan War\\". All are described as being within the context of legitimate resistance to the occupation of Ireland. This discussion is largely romanticised and aimed at demonstrating a lineage of \\"armed struggle\\" from which the IRA assumes its legitimacy in the fight against \\"occupying forces in Ireland\\". One entry in this discussion is the fact that the efforts of IRA guerrillas were the direct cause in ending the British occupation of the 26 counties of Ireland‚Äîthe territory that would become the Irish Free State, and later the Republic of Ireland. The 1956 manual also implies that the bulk of the IRA's work in \\"freeing Ireland from occupation\\" is over. This indicates both a \\"southern\\" perspective on Irish independence and an underestimation of the resistance they would encounter during the Border Campaign, that was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. With the publication of the 1977 edition this assumption of an easy victory in ending partition had been dropped and the \\"Long War\\" strategy adopted. The 1956 edition summarises the result of the violence during the 1919-1921 Irish War of Independence (referred to by republicans, who considered independence as having been only partially achieved, as the Tan War) with this passage: > \\"The hammer blows of the guerrillas destroyed the British administration. > The guerrillas acted in small numbers in the right localities and compelled > the British to disperse to find them. Then as the British searched, they hit > them at will by means of the ambush. Communications were systematically > destroyed and even the British army's transport system in the country was > disorganised.\\" > \\"The enemy's intelligence service was completely dislocated. The R.I.C.- the > eyes and ears of British rule- was demoralised. British justice courts could > not operate--for the people ignored them. The British gradually were forced > to evacuate the smaller, more isolated garrisons. They concentrated in the > larger towns. The areas evacuated came under sole control of The Republic. > The next step was to isolate the larger centres and keep cutting > communications and constantly hitting the enemy. In time these would have > been evacuated too. Thus ended the last great phase of guerrilla operations > against British rule in Ireland.\\" Compare to the Marxist interpretation in the 1977 edition, published during a new campaign and new conditions of waging war. The \\"struggle\\" is couched in more socio-economic terms, terms which would have made more sense to a generation living through unemployment and economic hardship in post industrial revolution Northern Ireland (referred to here as the \\"six counties\\"). It is also an indication of the influence of Marxist Philosophy that permeated the IRA in the late 1970s: > \\"The objective of the 800 years of oppression 'is economic exploitation with > the unjustly partitioned 6 counties remaining Britain's directly controlled > old-style colony' and the South under the 'continuing social, cultural and > economic domination of London'. This last led to Irish savings being > invested in England 'for a higher interest rate' and many hundreds of > thousands of boys and girls from this country had to emigrate to England to > seek the employment which those exported saving created.\\" > \\"Another aspect of economic imperialism at work is the export of raw, > unprocessed materials: live cattle on the hoof - mineral wealth, fish caught > by foreign trawlers, etc. Further, from 1956 on, the Free State abandoned > all attempts to secure an independent economy, and brought in foreign multi- > national companies to create jobs instead of buying their skills and then > sending them home gradually. Africanisation' is the word for this process > elsewhere. Control of our affairs in all of Ireland lies more than ever > since 1921 outside the hands of the Irish people. The logical outcome of all > this was full immersion in the E.E.C. in the 1970s. The Republican Movement > opposed this North and South in 1972 and 1975 and continues to do so. It is > against such political economic power blocks East and West and military > alliances such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\\" While the 1956 edition does not engage in any legitimisation of the struggle beyond the historical context of resistance to occupation, the 1977 edition does - claiming direct legitimacy from the members of the Second D√°il who transferred their authority to the IRA in 1938 after the takeover of the IRA Army Council by Se√°n Russell. This had always been the official ideology of the IRA, however after the split between the Provisional IRA and the Official IRA in 1969 it was probably deemed necessary to lay more of a claim to the historical struggle than the pre-split IRA had felt necessary. The 1956 edition would have also been published for use during a period when the failed S-Plan or Sabotage campaign was within living memory of younger IRA volunteers. Newer volunteers needed to be reminded of previous IRA activity in the \\"struggle for liberation\\": > \\"The moral position of the Irish Republican Army, its right to engage in > warfare, is based on: :*(a) the right to resist foreign aggression; :*(b) > the right to revolt against tyranny and oppression; and :*(c) the direct > lineal succession with the Provisional Government of 1916, the first D√°il of > 1919 and the second D√°il of 1921\\". > \\"In 1938 the seven surviving faithful Republican Deputies delegated > executive powers to the Army Council of the I.R.A. per the 1921 resolution. > In 1969 the sole surviving Deputy, Joseph Clarke, reaffirmed publicly that > the then Provisional Army Council and its successors were the inheritors of > the first and second D√°il as a Provisional Government.\\" In November 2003, during testimony to the Saville Inquiry on the events of Bloody Sunday, Martin McGuinness, the alleged former Chief of Staff of the IRA, denied that he had ever read such a book before reputedly leaving the IRA in 1974. McGuinness reportedly said: \\"When I was in the IRA there was no such book, I don't know when it came into existence.\\" When asked what the phrase \\"green book\\" meant, he stated: \\"I think it means the book was green.\\"McGuinness risks jail for not naming IRA comrades The Guardian November 6, 2003  The Guerrilla / The Volunteer The 1977 edition of the Green Book is very much focused on the mental strength of the volunteer. The manual is eager to draw a clear distinction between volunteer and his enemy: > \\"A member of the I.R.A. is such by his own choice, his convictions being the > only factor which compels him to volunteer, his objectives the political > freedom and social and economic justice for his people. Apart from the few > minutes in the career of the average Brit that he comes under attack, the > Brit has no freedom or personal initiative. He is told when to sleep, where > to sleep, when to get up, where to spend his free time etc.\\" In the 1977 edition, the term guerrilla is dropped in favour of \\"volunteer\\"; the new edition also stresses that this volunteer is part of a movement with common aims and objectives. From the PIRA's point of view, this would have been necessary to combating competing interpretations encountered in the community and the propaganda efforts of the enemy they faced: > \\"Before we go on the offensive politically or militarily we take the > greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not > advocate a United Ireland without being able to justify our right to such a > state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as > our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any > other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim that we are > going to escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an > operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary > defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are > in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers > involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture > etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates > our supporters.\\" The 1956 edition on the other hand stresses the physical aspects of IRA operations: > \\"Outside of the support he [the guerrilla] gets from the people among whom > he operates - and this support must never be underestimated for it is vital > to his eventual success - he fights alone. He is part of an independent > formation that is in effect an army by itself. He must be self-contained. If > necessary he must act alone and fight alone with the weapons at his disposal > - and these very often will not be of the best. He must find his own > supplies. His endurance has to be great: and for this he needs a fit body > and an alert mind. Above all he must know what he is fighting for - and > why.\\" Military objectives in the Green Book The 1977 edition describes the military objectives of the IRA as: > \\"The position of the Irish Republican Army since its foundation in 1916 has > been one of sustained resistance and implacable hostility to the forces of > imperialism, always keeping in the forefront of the most advanced > revolutionary thinking and the latest guerrilla warfare techniques in the > world.\\" The enemy is described as: > \\"The establishment is all those who have a vested interest in maintaining > the present status quo in politicians, media, judiciary, certain business > elements and the Brit war machine comprising, the Brit Army, the U.D.R., > R.U.C. (r) [reserve], Screws, Civilian Searchers. The cure for these armed > branches of the establishment is well known and documented. But with the > possible exceptions of the Brit Ministers in the 'Northern Ireland Office' > and certain members of the judiciary, the overtly unarmed branches of the > establishment are not so clearly identifiable to the people as our enemies > as say armed Brits or R.U.C.\\" The military objects of the IRA in 1977 are presented as closely tied to the political objectives of politicising the citizenry. Rather than the tactic of surgical strike, the tactic of continuous escalation or the strategy of what has been called the PIRA's Tet offensive is preferred: > \\"By now it is clear that our task is not only to kill as many enemy > personnel as possible but of equal importance to create support which will > carry us not only through a war of liberation which could last another > decade but which will support us past the 'Brits Out' stage to the ultimate > aim of a Democratic Socialist Republic.\\" > \\"The Strategy is: # A war of attrition against enemy personnel which is > aimed at causing as many casualties and deaths as possible so as to create a > demand from their people at home for their withdrawal. # A bombing campaign > aimed at making the enemy's financial interest in our country unprofitable > while at the same time curbing long term financial investment in our > country. # To make the Six Counties as at present and for the past several > years ungovernable except by colonial military rule. # To sustain the war > and gain support for its ends by National and International propaganda and > publicity campaigns. # By defending the war of liberation by punishing > criminals, collaborators and informers.\\" The 1956 edition stresses military objectives and barely mentions political objectives. It contains a lot of practical advice on operating as a guerrilla fighter and how to inflict damage on targets. No mention is made of the establishment of \\"a Democratic Socialist Republic\\". This can probably been seen in the context of the IRA keeping pace with social changes and the material aspirations of Irish men and women living within the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. At the time of the Border Campaign the communities the IRA came to rely on were not politicised to the same degree as those in 1977. A lack of support within their host community is commonly given as the reason for the failure of the Border Campaign. This edition of the Green Book even goes so far as to announce the aim of restoring the Irish language as the national language, an aim not mentioned in the earlier edition. Military equipment in the Green Book The 1977 edition of the Green Book makes little mention of arms and equipment available to the volunteer. The one entry that does appear deals only with the issue of tactics as affected by lack of weaponry: > \\"Tactics are dictated by the existing conditions. Here again the logic is > quite simple. Without support Volunteers, Dumps, Weapons, Finance, etc., we > cannot mount an operation, much less a campaign. In September 1969 the > existing conditions dictated that the Brits were not to be shot, but after > the Falls curfew all Brits were to the people acceptable targets. The > existing conditions had been changed.\\" The 1956 edition goes into a lot of detail on arms that the volunteer can expect to encounter and how to use them. Explosives are detailed alongside what the guerrilla should know about handling & preparing them. The sabotage techniques and weaponry available at the time had mostly ceased to be commonly used by the late 1970s, namely: :*Gelignite, 808, TNT, Ammonal, Wet gun cotton, Plastic, and 822. Detonators are also detailed with physical descriptions, handling instructions, and burning rates. Detonators covered include: Cordtex and FID. Small arms listed range from the revolver, to the shotgun and submachine gun up to the flame thrower, which was almost never used, except for an attack on British soldiers of the King's Own Scottish Borderers. It can be assumed that the use of these weapons, or at least supplies of them, had been diminished when the 1977 edition was published. Given that the organisation was having troubles with internal security, it may have also been considered a security risk for the IRA to detail its available weaponry too closely. A generation earlier, IRA units operating during the S-Plan / Sabotage campaign did not have access to the above material, with the exception of Gelignite. IRA explosive devices of the 1930s and 1940s were prepared using materials such as Potassium chlorate, Carbide, Saxonite, Iron Oxide, Aluminium, sulfuric acid etc. By the time of the Northern Campaign (IRA) c. 1942, IRA Eastern Command, in cooperation with IRA Western Command could raise 12 tons of weapons and explosives at short notice. This was excluding the tons of weapons and explosives seized during the S-Plan campaign. When the IRA split in the early 1970s into the Official IRA and Provisional IRA, they divided the arms held in IRA weapons dumps. The Provisional IRA obtained the majority of these weapons. For details on the types of arms recently decommissioned by the IRA as part of their permanent cessation of violence see the article on the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and a breakdown of the PIRA's weapons before decommissioning took place in September 2005. Propaganda techniques in the Green Book  The 1977 edition stresses that the volunteer is ultimately responsible within the framework of the movement for ensuring the formulation, dissemination and efficiency of propaganda. This process was to begin within the mind of the volunteer himself: > \\"A new recruit's immediate obstacle is the removal of his (her) ignorance > about how to handle weapons, military tactics, security, interrogations etc. > An O.C.'s [Commanding Officer] might be how to put a unit on a military > footing; an I.O.'s [Intelligence Officer] how to create an effective > intelligence network; a Cumann na mBan Chairman's how best to mount a > campaign on a given issue, e.g. H Blocks etc., and for all members of the > movement regardless of which branch we belong to, to enhance our commitment > to and participation in the struggle through gaining as comprehensive an > understanding as possible of our present society and the proposed Republican > alternative through self and group education.\\" The stated war objectives of the IRA within the 1977 document included the success of national and international propaganda as a war objective: > \\"We exploit these mistakes [mistakes by the British Army] by propagating the > facts. So it was with their murderous mistakes of the Falls Road curfew, > Bloody Sunday and internment, which were exploited to our advantage support- > wise as was the murder of John Boyle in Dunloy.\\" The 1956 edition is a lot more practical, suggesting a more limited, less well oiled organisational machine of the IRA then than today: > \\"The main channels of information available to the guerrillas are > newspapers, leaflets, radio, word of mouth. Other methods may be worked out > and new ones invented. For example: Painting of slogans, proclamations and > manifestoes and so on. All the means of winning the confidence of the people > must be utilised. The ideas of the movement must be so popularised that no > one is in doubt-least of all the enemy-that it will win eventually.\\" > \\"This information service must function continuously to get maximum results. > Among the things it must do are: *Show weakness of enemy position and > propaganda used to bolster that position.'' *Show what is wrong with > political and social order. *Suggest remedies and how they can be brought > about. *Be in touch all the times with thinking of the people.\\" > \\"The world must know and understand what is being done, what the enemy is > trying to destroy and why, and the way these things can be ended and peace > restored and freedom won. The use of regular bulletins for foreign > newspapers and news-agencies becomes a necessity. The bulletin should be of > the documentary type: no room for emotional pleas or the like. Just the > facts.\\" While IRA volunteers also engaged in the above efforts, the techniques are not described in the 1977 Green Book. Interrogation techniques The 1956 edition contains no details on how to react to internment, capture, interrogation, or interrogation techniques. This was no doubt an oversight on the part of the IRA, one which they came to regret with the successful interrogation of IRA volunteers captured by their enemies. By 1977, with the launching of the IRA's campaign in Northern Ireland in 1969, the technical capabilities & anti-insurgency apparatus of the RUC, as well as the Regular and Specialist forces of the British Army had advanced. Coupled with this were technical advances in the intelligence gathering and interrogation techniques of those forces. The combination of these factors alongside political determination to capture and kill IRA forces and subdue the nationalist population of Northern Ireland led to changes in the Green Book. Much more stress was placed on resisting interrogation in what has been called The Green Book II.T.P. Coogan discusses the stress the PIRA placed on Interrogations in his history of the IRA. See here. If captured, the PIRA volunteer is warned to remain mentally implacable: > #\\"The most important thing to bear in mind when arrested is that you are a > volunteer of a revolutionary Army, that you have been captured by an enemy > force, that your cause is a just one, that you are right and that the enemy > is wrong and that as a soldier you have taken the chance expected of a > soldier and that there is nothing to be ashamed of in being captured. #You > must bear in mind that the treatment meted out to you is designed to break > you and so bleed you of all the information you may have with regard to the > organisation to which you belong. #They will attempt to intimidate you by > sheer numbers and by brutality. Volunteers who may feel disappointed are > entering the first dangerous threshold because the police will act upon this > disappointment to the detriment of the volunteer and to the furtherment of > their own ends. Volunteers must condition themselves that they can be > arrested and if and when arrested they should expect the worse and be > prepared for it.\\" A series of tactics employed by interrogators are listed along with the stages the interrogation process the volunteer should expect to go through: physical torture, subtle psychological torture, and humiliation. The remainder of the document persists in a similar vein, constantly stressing the dangers of submitting to interrogation techniques. This highlights the increasing threat the PIRA realised interrogations were having against the organisation. Most likely this was a result of experience gained throughout the 1970s and during the Border Campaign when arrest and imprisonment of IRA/PIRA volunteers seriously impacted the operational effectiveness of the respective organizations.

History =Beginnings= Then Northern Rhodesia, cricket was introduced into Zambia from neighbouring Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia), in the early 1900s. With the number of the British settlers relatively low compared to Southern Rhodesia, cricket was slow to develop.Encyclopedia of World Cricket by Roy Morgan, SportsBooks Publishing, 2007 Despite the slow rate of development, the MCC travelled to Livingstone in December 1930 during their tour of South Africa,MCC in South Africa, 1930/31, Northern Rhodesia leg at CricketArchive easily beating Northern Rhodesia by 9 wickets in their first international. By the late 1930s, cricket in Northern Rhodesia was being integrated with cricket in Southern Rhodesia, though it was rare to see players from the North playing for Rhodesia. =First formal organisation= After World War II, cricket was more formally organised with the formation of the Northern Rhodesia Cricket Union, and in 1948 an annual series of matches was begun against Southern Rhodesia. This lasted only until 1954 as the Southern Rhodesia side were much too strong to make any sort of decent contest. The North won only once, in 1952. One match was drawn and the other five all went the way of the South. With the formation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1954, cricket was fully integrated with Southern Rhodesia but investment was concentrated around Harare and Bulawayo, meaning that cricket began to decline in the country. Nevertheless, a team was still organised to play Australia in October 1957Australia in South Africa, 1957/58, Northern Rhodesia leg at CricketArchive to start off the Australians tour of South Africa. Australia scored 302/6 declared in their innings and Richie Benaud took 9/16 as the home team were dismissed for 85 in their first innings, but they managed to hold out for a draw in the two-day match.Scorecard of Northern Rhodesia v Australia, 19 October 1957 at CricketArchive No further matches were played by Northern Rhodesia, but Rhodesia did play two first-class matches at Ek Park, Kitwe in 1962, one against an International XI and one against a Commonwealth XI.First-class matches played on Ek Park, Kitwe at CricketArchive =Zambia starts play= With Zambia gaining independence in 1964, cricket began a resurgence. Previously representative cricket had been confined to the white population due to Rhodesian cricket's links with apartheid South Africa, the non-white population was now allowed to take part. The Zambian Cricket Union was formed almost immediately and multi-racial cricket began. Zambia began taking part in the East African regional tournaments with Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in 1968, playing their first match as Zambia against Kenya in Nairobi in September 1968.1968 East African Quadrangular Tournament at CricketArchive For instance, the 1975 Quadrangular was played in Kampala, sadly with rain spoiling much of the schedule, the scorecard from Zambia v Kenya 1975 and the Zambian team photograph from that tour to Uganda. The 1970s were the most successful period for Zambian cricket. The country became a favoured destination for English sides. Gloucestershire toured in 1971, Glamorgan in 1972, the MCC in 1974 and Warwickshire in 1977.Warwickshire in Zambia 1977/78 at CricketArchive However, in the early 1980s the government began to invest less money in sport and with athletics and soccer being of more interest, cricket was a low priority. A combined Minor Counties side toured in 1982, but this was the last match played by the national side until the mid-1990s, though some Zambian players did play as part of the East African cricket team and East and Central African cricket team. =Modern era= By the mid-1990s, cricket was confined almost entirely to Lusaka, but the national side returned to play in the African Cricket Association Championships in 1994.1994 African Cricket Association Championships at CricketArchive Zambia took part in the Africa Cup in 2002, beating Namibia and Tanzania2002 Africa Cup at CricketEurope and the Zambian Cricket Union became an associate member of the ICC in 2003, enabling the national side to take part in ICC tournaments for the first time.

For their efforts in bringing new music to a wider audience, the quartet was recently presented with the ASCAP/CMA Award For Adventurous Programming. History The Corigliano Quartet's repertoire ranges from classical to contemporary works, including three works by their namesake John Corigliano: String Quartet No. 1 \\"Farewell\\" (1995), Snapshot: Circa 1909 (2003), and Corigliano's string quartet arrangement of his A Black November Turkey (1972). The Corigliano Quartet has also been dedicated to the performance of music by younger, rising composers such as Shafer Mahoney, Adam Silverman and Jefferson Friedman as well as modern masters like Wynton Marsalis, Ben Johnston, Roberto Carnevale and Elliott Carter. Composed of violinists Michael Jinsoo Lim and Elisa Barston, who alternate at first violin, violist Melia Watras, and cellist Amy Sue Barston, the Corigliano Quartet rapidly climbed the ranks of the chamber music world. One year after its formation, the group drew the attention of Isaac Stern, who invited them to the Isaac Stern Chamber Music Workshop at Carnegie Hall.

It was Minolta's first SLR camera to feature both shutter priority and aperture priority automatic exposure modes. The camera also offered fully metered manual exposure as well as depth of field preview and an eyepiece shutter. Also, included were fully mechanical \\"O\\" (1/100 sec) and bulb settings, which allowed it to operate without a battery. The XD-7 was the top-of-the-line Minolta camera when it was in production and retains a reputation for quality. It was Minolta's last metal-bodied SLR design before the company switched to plastic with the X-700. There was also a less-expensive version of the XD-7 called the XD-5. Introduced in 1979, the XD-5 was mostly identical to the XD-7 but without some higher-end features like the eyepiece shutter or the display of the selected shutter speed in the viewfinder in manual exposure mode. A black variant with a viewfinder diopter instead of the eyepiece shutter called the XD-S was also offered in Japan. Many professional photographers have used the XD-7. One of the best known is Harry Benson, who often acknowledged the XD-7 in the various photography books he published in the 1980s.

He posthumously received the Medal of Honor. One of five children, he is the elder brother of Edith Hanson and Earl Dorchester Hanson. Early years Robert M. Hanson was the son of Methodist missionaries who served for several decades in India. In Lucknow, India, his playmates were Hindu children. He attended an American-run missionary school, Woodstock School, in Mussoorie in the Western Indian Himalayas, along with his siblings, Mark, Stanley, Earl Hanson, and Edith Hanson. After attending junior high school in the United States, he returned to India to become light-heavyweight and heavy-weight wrestling champion of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, at the time a large province in northern India. In his honor, the sports field at his alma mater Woodstock School in the Indian Himalayas is still named Hanson Field. World War II Robert M. Hanson Vought F4U-1 Corsair fighter. In the spring of 1938, on his way back to the United States to attend college, he bicycled his way through Europe and was in Vienna during the Anschluss. He was attending Hamline University, St. Paul, Minnesota, at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He enlisted for naval flight training in May 1942 and earned his wings and a Marine Corps commission as a second lieutenant on February 19, 1943 in Corpus Christi, Texas. First Lieutenant Hanson arrived in the South Pacific in June 1943 and his daring tactics and total disregard for death soon became well known. A master of individual air combat, he downed 20 enemy planes in six consecutive flying days. He was commended in the citation accompanying the Medal of Honor for his bold attack against six enemy torpedo bombers, November 1, 1943, over Bougainville Island, and for bringing down four Zeros, the premier Japanese fighter, while fighting them alone over New Britain, January 24, 1944. A member of VMF-215 flying the F4U-1 Corsair, the ace was shot down twice. The first time, a Zero caught him over Bougainville Island. Bringing his plane down on the ocean, he paddled for six hours in a rubber life raft before being rescued by the USS Sigourney (DD-643). His second and fatal crash occurred one day before his twenty-fourth birthday. He was last seen on February 3, 1944, when his plane crashed into the sea after a cancelled (due to overcast) fighter sweep mission over Rabaul, New Britain. He was attempting to destroy a lighthouse on Cape St. George, Southern New Ireland, that often gave the fighter group trouble by firing flak at the fighter group as they passed the lighthouse. His squadron leader Capt. Harold L. Spears watched as he attempted to land his damaged plane in the water during rough seas. His plane cart wheeled when one of the wings grabbed a wave and the plane disintegrated. He had no time to escape the cockpit, thus sank with his plane. He was subsequently declared killed in action. He has cenotaph memorials at Manila, Philippines and Newton, Massachusetts. The Medal of Honor was presented to the lieutenant's mother by Maj. Gen. Lewie G. Merritt on August 19, 1944 in Boston, Massachusetts. =Medal of Honor citation= Navy version The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to FIRST LIEUTENANT ROBERT M. HANSON UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE for service as set forth in the following CITATION: :For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a fighter pilot attached to Marine Fighting Squadron TWO FIFTEEN in action against Japanese forces at Bougainville Islands, November 1, 1943, and New Britain Island, January 24, 1944. Undeterred by fierce opposition and fearless in the face of overwhelming odds, First Lieutenant Hanson fought the Japanese boldly and with daring aggressiveness. On November 1, while flying cover for our landing operations at Empress Augusta Bay, he dauntlessly attacked six enemy torpedo bombers, forcing them to jettison their bombs and destroying one Japanese plane during the action. Cut off from his division while deep in enemy territory during a high cover flight over Simpson Harbor on January 24, First Lieutenant Hanson waged a lone and gallant battle against hostile interceptors as they were orbiting to attack our bombers and, striking with devastating fury, brought down four Zeros and probably a fifth. Handling his plane superbly in both pursuit and attack measures, he was a master of individual air combat, accounting for a total of 25 Japanese aircraft in this theater of war. His great personal valor and invincible fighting spirit were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\\"Medal of Honor ‚Äî 1stLt Robert M.

Intercepted by a superior number of Japanese fighters while covering a flight of our bombers in a strike against enemy shipping in Simpson harbor on 14 January, First Lieutenant Hanson boldly engaged the hostile planes in fierce combat, pressing home repeated attacks with devastating force. Separated from his squadron during the intense action, he valiantly continued the engagement alone, successfully destroying five enemy Zeros before being forced by lack of ammunition and gasoline to return to his base. First Lieutenant Hanson's superb airmanship, brilliant initiative and dauntless fighting spirit enabled our bombers to deliver a crushing blow to the Japanese in that sector and return safe to their base and his conduct throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

This was part of a more general division of the Northumbrian church by the Archbishop, who also divided the Bishopric of Hexham from the Bishopric of Lindisfarne.Bertam Colgrave (tr.), Bede: The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, p. 403, s.v. 192.

It is possible that Trumwine was present at the aforementioned battle,Fraser, Battle of Dunnichen, p. 47. and certainly he would have been a valuable source of advice for Ecgfrith.Fraser, Battle of Dunnichen, pp. 43-4. Whatever the case here, the Anglo-Saxons were defeated, expelled from Southern Pictland, and the episcopal establishment at Abercorn was hence abandoned and the diocese ceased to exist. The territory of modern West Lothian hence probably passed into the hands of the Verturian kings, although it is also possible that the British of Strathclyde took it over.D.P.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p. 86. In his days after 685, it is known that Trumwine interacted with Bede, and Bede's Life of Saint Cuthbert tells us that Trumwine was used as one of its sources. Trumwine is said to have related a story about Saint Cuthbert's childhood, which in turn had supposedly been told to Trumwine by Cuthbert himself.Bede, VC, ch. 1.

History On March 27, 1881, at the invitation of Father William Gleeson, pastor of St. Anthony Church in Brooklyn, (East Oakland), Sister Marie de Sacre Coeur and four Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur founded an academy for girls, grades one through twelve, on a plot of land on the corner of Chestnut Street and San Jose Avenue in Alameda.\\"About SJND\\", Saint Joseph Note Dame High School Notre Dame Academy educated the young women of Alameda in grades one through twelve. St. Joseph's was, at that time a \\"mission\\" church of St. Anthony's. In 1885, Saint Joseph's Parish was established, with Father Michael McNaboe as first pastor. In 1887 Fr. McNaboe requested the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur to staff a boys elementary school. In 1916 Father James Bernard Praught opened Saint Joseph Elementary School for the boys and girls of the parish. In 1922 a new co-ed grammar school was donated to the parish by Theresa Ettinger in memory of her husband, the late Victor Ettinger. When St. Joseph Elementary Grammar School was built, the original school buildings became part of the girls high school, the Academy was renamed Notre Dame High School, a combined boarding and day school. In 1960, Monsignor Alvin P. Wagner demolished the antiquated girls high school and built a new Saint Joseph's Notre Dame High School for girls. He erected the Gymnasium/Auditorium in 1964. The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur stayed with the elementary and high schools until 1990. Saint Joseph's Boys High School was founded in 1935 by Father Praught and Father Joseph Tetzlaff, provincial of the Brothers of Mary (Marianists) on the same city block as Saint Joseph's Church, Saint Joseph's Elementary School and Notre Dame Girls High School. The Brothers of Mary (Marianists) departed in 1970. In 1972, Pope Paul VI honored Monsignor Wagner and the people of the parish by making the church a minor basilica, renamed Saint Joseph Basilica. In 1983, Msgr. Wagner retired. Oakland Bishop John Stephen Cummins plans were set in motion to no longer staff the parish with diocesan priests. Cummins invited the Fathers of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart. The new pastor, Father Patrick A. Goodwin, SSCC decided to consolidate the two schools. These plans were completed in 1985 with the consolidation of the two single-sex schools into the coeducational St. Joseph Notre Dame High School. In 2007, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary decided to leave Saint Joseph's Community. Oakland Bishop Allen Vigneron returned the parish to the diocesan priests.

She was the third wife of Booker T. Washington. She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1972. Biography Margaret Murray was born on March 9 in Macon, Mississippi, in the early 1860s. Her birth year is unknown; her tombstone says she was born in 1865, but the 1870 census lists her birth year as 1861. She was one of ten children born to sharecroppers; an Irish immigrant father and an African- American mother, a washerwoman and possibly former slave. Her father died when she was seven, and the next day she moved to live with a Quaker couple by the name of Sanders. They encouraged her to become a teacher, one of the few occupations available to women at the time. As a child Murray spent much of her time reading and quickly excelled in school. By the age of fourteen, she was so advanced in her studies that the school offered her a teaching position. Determined to further her teaching career, at the age of nineteen, Murray enrolled in Fisk University, where she completed the college preparatory course in five years and college in four. =Marriage= It was at Fisk that Murray first met Booker T. Washington. Regarding her as a model student, Washington asked her to take over the position of Lady Principal, formerly held by his deceased second wife. By 1890, Murray was writing to Washington to express her deep feelings for him. He proposed the following year and, after some hesitation, Murray accepted Washington's proposal and they were married in 1893. Murray and Washington shared a home with Washington's relatives and his children from his previous marriage until they moved into The Oaks, the homestead which the Tuskegee Institute built for their family in 1901.The Oaks: Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site Cultural Landscape Report (United States National Park Service: Southeast Regional Office, 2017); available at http://npshistory.com/publications/tuin/clr-oaks.pdf Washington was reluctant to share his feelings with Murray, and often left her to tend his children while he was away on business. Though Washington never got over the loss of his first two wives, he believed that Margaret provided a well-ordered household, and the two were generally happy with their marriage. Margaret wrote Washington's speeches and she helped her husband in expanding the school and traveled with him on his tours and speaking engagements. =Career= During her tenure as Lady Principal of Tuskegee, she also created the Tuskegee Woman's Club and merged local organizations with women clubs to help improve the values and liberation of womanhood in African-American women of the Jim Crow south. In 1895 she gave an influential speech titled \\"Individual Work for Moral Elevation\\" at the First National Conference of the Colored Women of America. She is credited with co-founding the National Association of Colored Women in 1896. She founded country schools, taught women how to live and attend to their homes, worked for the improvement of prisons, started the Mt. Meigs School for boys and an industrial school for girls at Tuskegee, and constantly worked for the betterment of the poor and neglected. In 1912, she became the fifth president for the National Association of Colored Women. After the death of her husband in 1915, Washington worked to improve the educational system for African Americans. She became deeply involved in domestic education for mothers in Tuskegee and in supporting schools for children at surrounding plantations. As with the programs advocated by her husband, Margaret Murray Washington focused on domestic and vocational education. She became involved in interracial cooperation and participated in the path-breaking Memphis Women's Inter-Racial Conference in 1978. [1920?] =Death= Margaret Murray Washington remained at The Oaks until her death in 1925. She is buried in the university cemetery, next to her husband.The Oaks: Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site Cultural Landscape Report (United States National Park Service: Southeast Regional Office, 2017); available at http://npshistory.com/publications/tuin/clr-oaks.pdf Legacy In 1972, Washington was inducted into Alabama's Women Hall of Fame for her compassion, intelligence, and independence of judgement, which led her to be among the greatest women and African American leaders of her century. M.M. Washington Career High School in Washington, DC was named in her honor. The school closed in 2008. Also named for her is a building on the Tuskegee campus.  Activist for anti-lynching  Around the turn of the century, many black people of the south were being targeted as victims of lynching. With the increasing numbers of lynching going on with blacks many organizations started to form during this period. In 1895 a large group of black women formed the National Federation of Afro-American Women, and Margaret Murray was elected the president. This organization did an array of jobs from helping women in the south that were trying to buy a house to opening day care giving women an opportunity to go to work. The union of the NFAA and the Washington Colored League formed the National Federation of Afro-American Women. Washington was a firm believer that many racial issues could be fixed through interracial cooperation. She believed that not everyone was out to harm people of color. In 1920 a National Association of Colored Women Conference was held in Tuskegee, Alabama. The main topic on the agenda was lynching. Many of the recently founded anti-lynching organizations in attendance expressed their support in a bill that defined lynching as an act of \\"murder\\", and that the killer had to suffer repercussions for their actions. Two important white women in attendance, Carrie Parks Johnson and Sara Estelle Haskins, from the Southern Methodist Women's Committee, were invited to Washington's home. Both women were surprised at the huge number of highly educated black middle class women there.  Black women rising to power supporter  She delivered a speech in 1898, \\"We Must Have a Cleaner Social Morality,\\"; in this speech she gave advice to black women, including * criticism: it not always negative, but can help black women evolve * their race needs to be strong * stop taking oneself out of the group: look at the black race as a whole, a family * start building each other up, rather than tearing each other down * criticism of motherhood: black women must do a better job of parenting * the black race must be morally dignified in action * do not judge every white person as being racist; not all are * get educated * the alarming increase of death rate and the rising number of illegitimate births among blacks * statistics on how most Southern cities' black population is higher than the white population * awareness of health and family histories with diseases * being educated on racial dimensions in certain situations Quotes * \\"If we wish to help each other let us not only praise ourselves, but also criticize.

The store was considered one of the staples of the Minneapolis rock scene in the 1980s, along with Jay's Longhorn Bar, and became a popular hub for musicians in the Twin Cities and the Midwest. The store was essentially the only place in Minneapolis that sold punk rock records in the 1970s and early 1980s, which made it a popular hangout for members of local bands such as H√ºsker D√º, The Replacements, the Suicide Commandos, Soul Asylum and many more. Bob Mould of H√ºsker D√º called it the city's \\"preeminent record store\\" and an important venue for him to find a fellow music-loving community. Martin Keller, writer for the Minneapolis City Pages, said about Oar Folk: \\"A lot of people trace the whole rock scene (in the Twin Cities) to Oar Folk. I was living six blocks away at the time, and you'd always run into [Peter] Jesperson there because he worked the counter most days. [Bob] Mould was in and out on a regular basis. It was a real nice hangout.\\"Cost, J., Earles, A., Fritch, M., Hickey, M., Klinge, S., Miller, E., Olson, D., Rowland, H., Ryan, M., and Valania, J.: A Tale Of Twin Cities: H√ºsker D√º, The Replacements And The Rise And Fall Of The ‚Äô80s Minneapolis Scene, Magnet, June 12, 2005. Lori Barbero, drummer for Babes in Toyland said concerning the store: \\"I have about 8,000 records, and I bought 7,000 of them at Oar Folk.\\" Grant Hart of H√ºsker D√º was not so fond of the store: \\"Oar Folk had a real snobbish attitude. It was a place to be condescended to.\\" History Vern Sanden purchased what was then North Country Music in 1973 and renamed it \\"Oar Folkjokeopus.\\" (The name was based on the solo album Oar by Alexander \\"Skip\\" Spence, a founding member of Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape and an album by British folk musician Roy Harper, Folkjokeopus.) Peter Jesperson managed the store from 1974 until 1982. Jesperson co-founded Twin/Tone Records during this time and the store as well as the label thrived due in large part to each other. Between Twin/Tone, local venue Jay's Longhorn Bar and Oar Folk, this trifecta largely fueled the punk and rock scene in Minneapolis during that era. Bands such as The Replacements, The Suburbs, Flamin' Oh's, H√ºsker D√º, Soul Asylum, Jayhawks, and Curtiss A all maintained links between the three. In 1985, a fire gutted Oar Folk. Vern Sanden reopened the record store with the help of Bill Melton and Mark Trehus, who ran his own indie record label, Treehouse Records. Treehouse Records After Oar Folkjokeopus closed in April, 2001, Mark Trehus opened a store at the same site known as Treehouse Records. Much of the store's original character remained. Treehouse specialized in having a large amount of vinyl LPs, vinyl 45s, and both new and used CDs. Treehouse closed on December 31, 2017.

Grant, at a cottage in Mt. McGregor, New York, 1885, working on his memoirs The Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant is an autobiography by Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States, focused mainly on his military career during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War, and completed as he was dying of throat cancer in 1885. The two-volume set was published by Mark Twain shortly after Grant's death. Twain created a unique marketing system designed to reach millions of veterans with a patriotic appeal just as Grant's death was being mourned. Ten thousand agents canvassed the North, following a script that Twain had devised; many were veterans who dressed in their old uniforms. They sold 350,000 two-volume sets at prices from $3.50 to $12, depending on the binding (roughly $ to $ in ). Each copy contained what looked like a handwritten note from Grant himself. In the end, Grant's widow, Julia, received about $450,000 ($ in ), suggesting a gross royalty before expenses of about 30%.Miller, Craig E. \\"'Give the Book to Clemens',\\" American History, April 1999, Vol. 34, Issue 1see also Booknotes interview with Mark Perry on Grant and Twain: The Story of a Friendship That Changed America, July 18, 2004.

Patriotic Gore: Studies in the Literature of the American Civil War, (1962) pp. 131‚Äì173. Positive attention is often directed toward Grant's prose, which has been praised as shrewd, intelligent, and effective. He portrayed himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero, whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness. He candidly depicts his battles against both the external Confederates and his internal Army foes.Russell, Henry M. W. \\"The memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant: The rhetoric of judgment,\\" Virginia Quarterly Review, (Spring 1990) vol. 66, no. 2, pp. 189‚Äì209. Background Adam Badeau, who assisted Grant in early stages of preparing his memoirs. Grant and his wife, Julia, took a trip around the world in 1877, after his second term in office, which left him short on money. He was nearly 60, and he looked for something to engage his time. The next year, he moved to New York City to go into business with his son Ulysses S. Grant, Jr. and Ferdinand Ward, a young investor who was described by his great- grandson Geoffrey Ward as \\"a very plausible, charming, unobtrusive, slender person with a genius for finding older people and pleasing them, which he learned early on.\\"Transcript of PBS biography of GrantThe firm of Grant & Ward did well at first, bolstered by Ward's skills and Grant's name. The former president bragged to friends that he was worth two and a half million dollars, and family members and friends poured money into the firm. But Grant was largely disengaged from the company's business, often signing papers without reading them. This proved disastrous, as Ward had used the firm as a Ponzi scheme, taking investors' money and spending it on personal items, including a mansion in Connecticut and a brownstone in New York City. Grant & Ward failed in May 1884, leaving Grant penniless. That fall, the former president was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer. Facing his mortality, Grant struck a publishing deal with his friend Mark Twain for his memoirs, hoping that they would provide for his family after his death. In the early stages of his work, he had the assistance of Adam Badeau, an author who had served on his staff during the war. Badeau left before the project was complete, having disputed with Grant and his family concerning how much he would be paid and how he would be credited for his research, editing, and fact-checking. Badeau eventually settled with Grant's heirs for $10,000 ().New York Times, \\"Gen. Badeau's Suit Ended\\", October 31, 1888 Grant suffered greatly in his final year. He was in constant pain from his illness and sometimes had the feeling that he was choking. Despite his condition, he wrote at a furious pace, sometimes finishing 25 to 50 pages a day. The cancer spread through his body, so the family moved to Mount MacGregor, New York, in June 1885 to make him more comfortable. He worked at finishing the book, propped up on chairs and too weak to walk. Friends, admirers, and even a few former Confederate opponents made their way to Mount MacGregor to pay their respects. Grant finished the manuscript on July 18; he died five days later. Structure Original editions of Grant's memoirs. The Memoirs are divided into two volumes. The autobiography is unusual but not unique in that large sections of Grant's life (most notably, his childhood and his presidency) are given brief mention or not discussed at all. The focus of the book is Grant's military career‚Äîhis service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Civil War. Grant's writing has been praised for its conciseness and clarity‚Äîa sharp contrast from contemporary Civil War memoirs, which tended to reflect the Victorian fondness for elaborate language. With regard to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Grant recorded his belief that it had been waged unjustly: > Generally, the officers of the army were indifferent whether the annexation > was consummated or not; but not so all of them. For myself, I was bitterly > opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as > one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It > was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European > monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional > territory. His account of Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House is particularly notable: Grant also makes asides to clear up legends that had grown up around his leadership. After dismissing one tale, Grant wrote \\"Like many other stories, it would be very good if it were only true.\\" The narrative ends shortly after the Army of the Potomac's final review in Washington in May 1865. Grant deliberately avoids comment on Reconstruction, apart from saying that he favored black suffrage. The final chapter, \\"Conclusion,\\" is a reflection on the war and its effects, the actions of foreign countries during it, and the reconciliation of North and South. In the final paragraphs, Grant makes note of his own condition and expresses optimism that \\"Federal and Confederate\\" can live together. The work was published in a two-volume set after his death. Grant's printed signature followed the dedication: \\"These volumes are dedicated to the American Soldier and Sailor. / U. S. Grant / New York City / May 23rd, 1885.\\" There are also numerous facsimile letters and correspondence bound into Volume II.Kathenes, Brian G. ISA, S-CAPP  Legacy  Mount McGregor retreat now Grant Cottage State Historic Site in Wilton, New York, where Grant completed his memoirs, just before his death. The press and public followed Grant's symptoms throughout his final year, and his work on the book was well known. While interest in his memoirs would have been high had Grant not been ill, his struggle to finish it before his death gave it even more attention. On release, the book received universal critical praise. Twain compared the Memoirs to Julius Caesar's Commentaries. Matthew Arnold praised Grant and his book in an 1886 essay. Twain, however, felt Arnold's tone was condescending to both Grant and the United States, and the two authors feuded until Arnold's death in 1888. Gertrude Stein also admired the book, saying she could not think of Grant without weeping. The Memoirs quickly became a best seller. The Grant family, who received 75% of the net royalties (after expenses), made approximately $450,000 () from the book, re- establishing their fortune. Ulysses S. Grant sought to deliver his moral, political, economic and social argument for waging the war against the South in his Personal Memoirs. As the commander of the Union army and a two-term president, he had a unique perspective on the war that interested both the public and historical scholars, as they wanted to hear his side of the story. Although he was a clear figure in the public eye, Grant was unknown to many people. After the war, Grant's close colleague, General William T. Sherman remarked that, although he had known Grant for decades, \\"to me he is a mystery, and I believe he is a mystery to himself.\\"Rafuse, Ethan Sepp. \\"Still a Mystery? General Grant and the Historians, 1981‚Äì2006.\\" The Journal of Military History, (July 2007) vol. 71, no. 3, pp. 849‚Äì874. In his Personal Memoirs, Grant portrayed himself as representative character of the North. In volume 1, he describes his family background and points to his simple upbringing as the reason for his solid, restrained virtues of a normal Northerner.Waugh, Joan. The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture. (North Carolina: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004). Grant goes to the point of declaring himself as \\"unmilitary\\" while continually stressing his simple nature. Grant stated that he did not even want to attend West Point, only going because his father thought it would be best, as Grant believed \\"a military life had no charms for me.\\" Grant wrote of his participation in the Mexican War of 1846‚Äì1848, a war he did not support. Grant believed it was very unjust for the larger, stronger United States to pick on a weaker country as they were doing.Waugh, Joan. The Memory of the Civil War in American Culture. (North Carolina: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004). Grant used his Personal Memoirs as a way to respond to negative criticism immediately following the war, especially present in his description of the Battle of Shiloh. The two leading generals of the Union army at Shiloh were Grant and General Don Carlos Buell and they had very differing accounts of the battle. Many criticized Grant for being tremendously unprepared and Buell goes as far as to credit himself for the victory, while Grant proclaims the opposite story, stating the Union win was inevitable.Rafuse, 850‚Äì851. Grant was able to use this book to portray his own personal memories of the events of the war and dispute any negative press he may have received. Grant also used his Personal Memoirs to explain his battlefield action and his motives for the way he led. After the war, Grant was portrayed as a ruthless leader who stopped at nothing to make sure the South was destroyed. However, Grant felt this was a harsh evaluation and sought to improve the public opinion of himself and defend the fact he believed he was a simple and fair man. Grant felt he was being abused by newspaper coverage that he believed was shoddy, inaccurate and defeatist. He stated, \\"Up to the Battle of Shiloh, I, as well as thousands of other citizens, believed that the rebellion against the Government would collapse suddenly and soon, if decisive victory could be gained over any of its armies. ‚Ä¶ After Shiloh, I gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest. ‚Ä¶ The Northern troops were never more cruel than the necessities of war required.\\"Waugh, 28. Geoffrey Perret, the author of Ulysses S. Grant: Soldier and President staunchly disagreed with Grant's assertion that he was acting out of necessity and declared Grant's wartime conquests were against his Northern virtues. In Perret's eyes, Grant was \\"above all a soldier, and not a reluctant one.\\" Perret argued that Grant in fact liked West Point, had few reservations at the time about the Mexican War and was a very good junior officer. Perret backs these accusations with the fact Grant, while appointed the General-in-Chief, \\"evolved the future of the United States Army\\" by applying \\"maximum firepower, maximum mobility\\" while relying on \\"the wide envelopment\\" as his principal form of maneuver.Rafuse, 859. Given over a century of favorable literary analysis, according to reviewer Mark Perry, the Memoirs are \\"the most significant work\\" of American non-fiction. = Mark Twain's opinion = = Modern annotated edition = On October 16, 2017, the first completely annotated edition of the memoirs was published by Harvard University Press. Executive Director of the Ulysses S. Grant Association John F. Marszalek, Associate Editor David S. Nolen, and Assistant Editor Louie P. Gallo completed the project in order to contextualize the memoirs for the modern reader. See also * Bibliography of Ulysses S.

The county is included in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell Metropolitan Statistical Area. The school system serves all of Fayette County. Residents elect a five-member school board to set policy and hire a superintendent of schools. Until May 2013, school board members were elected at-large in the county; this jurisdiction was one of only 20 remaining among the 180 school districts in the state to elect board members by an exclusively at-large process. After trying to persuade the county board of commissioners to change the system, a coalition of residents, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, filed suit against the county and school board for violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, asserting that the county system diluted the voting power of the significant minority of African Americans, who today comprise 20% of the county population. They had been prevented by this system (and disenfranchisement prior to 1965) from ever electing a candidate of their choice to the board or county council in 191 years. As a result of Georgia State Conference of the NAACP, et al. v. Fayette County Board of Commissioners, et al.

They were formed in 1970 and were discovered by Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath in 1972. After recording one album in 1973, they split up. The album was not released until 1999. In 2007 they were mentioned by Classic Rock magazine as a \\"lost pioneer\\" of heavy metal.

Members from both bands, Barry \\"Baz\\" Dunnery (lead guitar), Dennis McCarten (bass), Frank Hall (drums), and singer Bill Branch, formed a heavy progressive blues outfit they called Hot Spring Water. They were briefly renamed Taurus before settling on Necromandus after a radio show asked their audience for name suggestions. In 1972, after extensive gigging and a failure to release a record, they caught the ear of Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, who began managing the group. In early 1973, Necromandus, under Iommi's guidance, recorded the album Orexis of Death at London's Morgan Studio. Iommi also added some guitar to the title track. A deal was arranged with Vertigo and the band began opening for Sabbath as well as Tony Kaye's Badger. Dunnery left the band in 1973, and as a result the album was shelved by Vertigo. Necromandus continued to receive praise and support, with Ozzy Osbourne initially wanting Necromandus's guitarist, bassist and drummer for his Blizzard of Ozz project. Dennis McCarten, Barry Dunnery, and Frank Hall were in fact the Original Blizzard Of Ozz with Osbourne in 1977. Dunnery and Hall founded the cover band Nerves, with Dunnery leaving to join the ELO offshoot Violinski in 1976. Dunnery and Hall also played together in the new wave of British heavy metal band Hammerhead, although Dunnery's stint was brief. The only surviving member of Necromandus is Frank Hall. Dennis McCarten (born 1950) died of a kidney illness in December 2004, and Barry Dunnery (the elder brother of Francis Dunnery) died on 29 May 2008 from cancer, at the age of 56. The date of Bill Branch's death is currently unknown (William J Branch was born 21 Mar 1950, died Jun 1995, see his entry at FamilySearch).

The film was released in theaters in the United States on November 24, 1993. It received negative reviews from critics, with some praising its animation, musical score, and voice performances, but many criticizing its narrative, running time and characters, particularly the lack of focus and development on the protagonists. Plot In New York City, an Eastern bluebird named Buster runs away from his siblings and he meets an intelligent orange Tyrannosaurus named Rex, who is playing golf. He explains to Buster that he was once a ravaging dinosaur, and proceeds to tell his personal story. In a prehistoric jungle, Rex is terrorizing other dinosaurs when a spaceship lands on Earth, piloted by an alien named Vorb. Vorb captures Rex and gives him \\"Brain Grain\\", a breakfast cereal that anthropomorphizes Rex and vastly increases his intelligence. Rex is introduced to other dinosaurs, altered by the Brain Grain: a blue Triceratops named Woog, a purple Pteranodon named Elsa, and a green Parasaurolophus named Dweeb. They soon meet Vorb's employer Captain Neweyes, the inventor of Brain Grain, who reveals his goal of allowing the children of the present time to see real dinosaurs. He plans to take them to Dr. Julia Bleeb who will guide them to the Museum of Natural History and warns them to keep away from Professor Screweyes, his nefarious and evil brother who travels around causing mischief after losing his left eye several years ago.

Instead, they meet a young boy named Louie, who plans on running away to join the circus. Louie agrees to help the dinosaurs get to the museum. Riding on Elsa, Louie soon encounters a girl named Cecilia, who is miserable with her life because of her neglectful parents. She agrees to run away with Louie and help the dinosaurs, and when she threw away her Thanksgiving hat, it lands on a little girl who wished for a similar hat and ends up granting her wish. To prevent mass panic, Louie decides that the dinosaurs need to stay hidden during their journey to the museum. He disguises them as floats in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. But when Rex sees the Apatosaurus balloon coming out in the parade, Rex greets it, thinking it is real and already-intelligent like he is. Then in the process of hand-shaking, Rex unwittingly punctures the balloon, causing it to run out of air and fall on the dinosaurs, but left them unharmed. When the audience realize that live dinosaurs are among them, they fly into a panic, and the dinosaurs flee to Central Park while being pursued by the police and the army. Meanwhile, Louie and Cecilia meet Professor Screweyes, who is running his \\"Eccentric Circus\\". Unaware of Screweyes' sinister nature, the children sign a contract to perform in his circus troupe. When the dinosaurs arrive at the circus, Screweyes explains that he delights in scaring people and believes that the dinosaurs would make a great addition to his circus. Using his \\"Brain Drain\\", pills that are the polar opposite of his brother's Brain Grain, Screweyes devolves Louie and Cecilia into chimpanzees. When he offers the dinosaurs to consume the pills and join his circus as a ransom in exchange for the two children's freedom, they reluctantly accept and Screweyes releases Louie and Cecilia, agreeing to tear up their contract in the process. Knowing their friendship will be lost forever, Rex transforms Louie and Cecilia back to their human forms with his gentle pats. And before leaving, he sadly tells the two children to remember him. As the kids awake the next morning, they are greeted by a circus clown named Stubbs, who works for Professor Screweyes, serves them breakfast and explains everything. Upon seeing the dinosaurs returned to their natural savage states, Louie and Cecilia plan to sneak into the night's show and save the dinosaurs with Stubbs' help. That night, Professor Screweyes opens his circus with a parade of demons and evil spirits, and then unveils the dinosaurs to the terrified audience. Screweyes says he can control Rex, and proceeds to hypnotize him, while bragging that he is never afraid. However, a crow unintentionally activates the flare lights, breaking Rex out of the trance. Realizing he has been tricked, Rex becomes enraged and attempts to eat Screweyes, making him afraid after his talk. However, Louie steps in and desperately talks Rex out of killing Screweyes. His impassioned pleas and loving touches, along with Cecilia's, return Rex and the other dinosaurs to their kind and friendly natures. Just then, Captain Neweyes arrives in his ship and congratulates Louie and Cecilia, who proceed to kiss, while Stubbs puts on an act announcing his resignation from Professor Screweyes' employ which wins the audience over with laughter. Neweyes, Louie, Cecilia and the dinosaurs board the aircraft, leaving Screweyes to be swarmed upon and devoured by the crows and one crow flies off with his now powerless screw. The dinosaurs spend the rest of their days in the museum, allowing children to see live dinosaurs, and thus fulfilling their wishes. Back in the present, Rex tells Buster that he and his fellow dinosaurs are still in the museum. He also reveals that Louie and Cecilia have reconciled with their respective parents and become a couple. Rex returns Buster to his family, ignoring his brothers' taunts while hugging his mom, and Rex tells him to remember his story before leaving for the museum.

As in a five-year production schedule, it takes four years for the film to be made. In January 1990, after the film's voice actors recorded their voices for the characters, animating and filming began. The animators drew storyboards, and used cameras, recorded audio, pencil tests (rough and clean- up), ink and paint (the final version of the film) to bring the characters to life. James Horner composed the film's music score, as well as the film's only song \\"Roll Back the Rock (to the Dawn of Time)\\", sung by John Goodman. After four years in the making, the film was completely wrapped in October 1993 (a month before the film's theatrical release on November 24, that year). The film was originally promoted with John Malkovich listed alongside Cronkite, Goodman, Child, Leno, and Short, but he did not appear in the final version. Promotion To promote the film's theatrical release during the holiday season, a giant helium balloon of Rex the T. Rex was included in the real-life 1993 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Unfortunately, as the parade moved through Columbus Circle, high winds caught the Rex balloon and caused it to lift over the nearby sidewalk. The head of the Rex balloon struck a protruding street light and popped, but the rest of the dinosaur's body remained inflated until the end of the parade. Pizza Hut carried a series of toys. Dakin and Just Toys made stuffed animals and bendies. Reception =Box office= The film grossed a total of $3,707,770 on its opening weekend and a total domestic gross of $9,315,576 in the United States, resulting the film to be a box office bomb. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 38% approval rating, based on 16 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a one star out of four stars and wrote, \\"It's shallow and kind of dumb, and the animation is routine, and the story isn't much, and the stakes are a lot higher these days in the featurelength animation game\\". Variety Daniel M. Kimmel gave the film a positive review and wrote: \\"In spite of narrative problems... the film's chief appeal is its central conceit -- that giant monsters... can be transformed into creatures who like to play with children\\".Variety Jane Horwitz of the Washington Post also gave the film a positive review, saying: \\"Handsomely drawn, and directed by a four-man crew at Spielberg's British-based animation studio, Amblimation, \\"We're Back!\\" looks good, though it lacks the gorgeous background detail of a Disney feature, or the heart-tugging romance of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" or \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" In \\"We're Back!,\\" science may take the place of sentimentality, but the hot-dog-gulping triceratops fills the cute quotient just fine.\\" Empire Magazine gave the film a two out of five stars and said, \\"Disappointing TV-standard film that will entertain children, but annoy their parents\\".Empire Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \\"Parents seeking innocent Kiddie entertainment should know that the dinosaurs are drugged, the children are briefly transformed into monkeys and the Professor is eventually devoured by crows\\". Charles Soloman of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a mostly negative review, saying, \\"Spielberg‚Äôs Amblimation Studio obviously boasts some talented artists, but they‚Äôre not ready to compete with the crew that made ‚ÄúBeauty and Beast‚Äù and ‚ÄúAladdin.‚Äù The needlessly convoluted story and even pacing reduce a film that should thunder like a tyrannosaurus to one that whimpers like a kitten\\".

The contents of a notebook are unorganized, and the number of subjects covered in a notebook are unlimited: a paragraph of autobiography can be followed immediately by one on astronomy or one on history. Some famous authors are also famous for the notebooks they left. The Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi kept a notebook, called Zibaldone, from 1817 to 1832. The idea of keeping that, which contains no fewer than 4,526 pages, was possibly suggested by a priest who fled from the French Revolution and came to live in the poet's hometown. The priest suggested that \\"every literary man should have a written chaos such as this: notebook containing sottiseries, adrersa, excerpta, pugillares, commentaria... the store-house out of which fine literature of every kind may come, as the sun, moon, and stars issued out of chaos.\\"Iris Origo, Leopardi: A Study in Solitude.

The Village Voice called her writing \\"... startling; full of passion\\", USA Today described it as \\"A wildly fascinating walk on the wild side!\\" while Ray Gun raved: \\"‚Ä¶tough and tender, with a trademark air of seen-it-all innocence that makes it glow\\". In 1994, she recorded a collection of her poetry and spoken-word routines entitled Ruined. Among the venues where she has performed spoken-word pieces include The Unhappy Hour at the Parlour Club. A professional belly dancer since 1991, and a burlesque performer since 1995, she was a seminal member of America's premiere burlesque troupe, \\"The Velvet Hammer\\", and appears in the 2001 documentary film The Velvet Hammer Burlesque. She co-starred in Margaret Cho's Off-Broadway variety show, The Sensuous Woman, in 2007 and again shared the stage with Cho in a 2012 Victory Variety Hour performance. Gehman has appeared dancing and acting in many films, television shows (including the sitcom The Nanny) documentaries on punk rock, belly dance and exotic dance and music videos both under her own name and under her stage name, Princess Farhana. Her music video credits include work with Madonna and Ricky Martin. In 1989, she co-wrote and starred in MGM's film The Runnin' Kind, and also appeared as Estelle in Steve Balderson's film Firecracker. In 2007 she acted as assistant choreographer to Fatima Robinson, for the belly dance sequence in Charlie Wilson's War. Under the name Princess Farhana, she has released a series of seventeen belly dance and burlesque instructional and performance DVDs. She is the author of \\"The Belly Dance Handbook: A Companion For The Serious Dancer\\" ( 2014) In 2006, she recorded the lead vocal for Blacklight Sleaze with British house music duo Peace Division, which entered the UK music charts. In April 2009, Pleasant reunited with cult director Steve Balderson for Stuck! - an homage to film noir women in prison dramas. Co-starring Karen Black, Mink Stole, Susan Traylor, and The Go-Go's Jane Wiedlin, Stuck! was filmed in Macon, Georgia and released in 2010. She continued to work with Balderson on many more films, including \\"The Casserole Club\\" (2010) \\"Culture Shock\\"(2012) \\"Occupying Ed\\" (2014) and \\"Helltown\\" (2015) Underbelly Underbelly is an acclaimed year-in-the-life documentary of Pleasant Gehman (aka Princess Farhana). Through a fortuitous chance meeting at the age of thirty-two, Pleasant discovered belly dancing. After years of punk rock rebellion, debauched cross-country indie-band tours, substance abuse, low self-esteem and bulimia, this twist of fate literally changed her life. Embarking on a dance career after training with well-known American dancers such as Zahra Zuhair and famed Egyptian dancers such as Raqia Hassan, she reinvented herself as Princess Farhana, and became an international belly dance star. Filming for Underbelly began in November 2006 at Tribal Dreams in Lincoln, Nebraska, and continued throughout all of 2007‚Äîin Sebastopol for Tribal Fest 7, to the Mexican Riviera for the Sun Bellies belly dance cruise, in New York for Margaret Cho's off Broadway hit The Sensuous Woman, to Hollywood, California - where Pleasant was given a commendation from the City of Los Angeles for her years of artistic contribution.

Ury was born in Birnbaum in Prussia, the son of a baker whose death in 1872 was followed by the family's relocation to Berlin. In 1878 Lesser left school to apprentice with a tradesman, and the next year he went to D√ºsseldorf to study painting at the Kunstakademie. Ury spent time in Brussels, Paris, Stuttgart, and other locations, before returning to Berlin in 1887. His first exhibition was in 1889 and met with a hostile reception, although he was championed by Adolph von Menzel whose influence induced the Akademie to award Ury a prize. In 1893 he joined the Munich Secession, one of the several Secessions formed by progressive artists in Germany and Austria in the last years of the 19th century. In 1901 he returned to Berlin, where he exhibited with the Berlin Secession, first in 1915 and notably in 1922, when he had a major exhibition. By this time Ury's critical reputation had grown and his paintings and pastels were in demand. His subjects were landscapes, urban landscapes, and interior scenes, treated in an Impressionistic manner that ranged from the subdued tones of figures in a darkened interior to the effects of streetlights at night to the dazzling light of foliage against the summer sky. Ury is especially noted for his paintings of nocturnal cafe scenes and rainy streets. He developed a habit of repeating these compositions in order to sell them while retaining the originals, and these quickly-made and inferior copies have harmed his reputation. Always introverted and distrustful of people, Ury became increasingly reclusive in his later years. He died in Berlin and is buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Berlin-Weissensee.

Elbaz studied art and theatre in Rabat and Paris from 1950 to 1961. He started painting only at the age of 21, until which age he had been interested mainly in theatre. A few years later, he managed to combine his two passions into a new approach in art-therapy, inventing together with his wife, a psychiatrist, the Pictodrame, which brought him world recognition. His first exhibition, which was very successful, took place in Casablanca in 1961 and earned him an appointment as Professor at the Beaux- Arts school in Casablanca. Years later, in 1976, he exhibited his paintings at the Tel-Aviv Museum. In parallel to his career as a painter, Elbaz is also known as a filmmaker. He produced several short films in France, Canada and the United States. One of them, La nuit n'est jamais compl√®te (The night is never complete), won a prize at the \\"5th Biennale de Paris in 1967\\" . Among the themes chosen for the many films he produced, there was a short one about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, as well as a series of drawings entitled Seuls (Alone), with texts written by both Elie Wiesel and Naim Kattan. Both the short movie and the drawings were a result of his fascination by Holocaust related themes. This fascination also inspired him for other works that were shown at an exhibition at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, in 1985. His paintings are famous for boasting traditional Jewish themes and he often present them in a chiefly expressionist style. A retrospective of his lifetime achievements and works was held in 1990 at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris.

She was steadily employed in the grain trade between North Atlantic ports and West Coast ports of North America, until 1889 when she was diverted from her normal routes to transport case oil to Japan.  Fate  After discharging most of the 65,000 cases of oil from Philadelphia in Kobe, Japan, she proceeded under ballast to Hakodate where she took on 2,230 tons of sulphur. She set sail on October 28th, 1889 for New York. Two days later on October 30th, she lost her maintopgallant and head sails in a typhoon and ran aground off the coast of Shariki, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. In a courageous rescue, the villagers saved a number of the crew and nursed them back to health. All aboard would have been lost had not the villagers, braving the wind and waves, tied ropes around themselves and ventured into the sea in a heroic attempt to carry any survivors to safety. Those remaining on shore also gave the best of their efforts by lighting fires, bringing food and clothes. Two youths ran the entire 40 miles (64 km) to the prefectural capital, Aomori, to summon help. Of the twenty-three crew members, nineteen drowned, and the other four were rescued by fishermen and villagers who worked through storms at the risk of their lives. Reports from the time indicate Mrs. Kudou, a local villager, held a frozen sailor against her bare body in an effort to save his life.  Connection between nations  framerightThe Cheseborough Memorial in Shariki Village. The inscription in Japanese reads, \\"The people who disappeared into the rough seas. The people who survived. The people who rescued by doing their best. Now, there is no one left. Only the bleat of the gulls and the sound of the sea are the same as the past.\\" From this incident, a friendship began between the village of Shariki, Japan, and the city of Bath, Maine. In 1994, officials of both municipalities signed a sister-city agreement promising future cooperation and further exchange. A letter from President of The United States to the citizens of Shariki, Japan: :\\"I commend you for honoring those people who lost their lives when the Cheseborough sank in 1890. By hosting the Bath, Maine, Junior High exchange students, you are contributing to our two nations efforts to sustain and deepen the goodwill that exists between us. The exchange program between students of Shariki and students of Bath is a shining example of the value of promoting mutual understanding and appreciation of different cultures. A strong relationship between Japan and the United States is vital in helping to meet the challenges that the future holds for us. Student exchange programs are especially important building blocks for stronger ties between Japan and the United States. Best wishes for any future exchanges and long-lasting friendships.\\" \\\\--Bill Clinton\\"Bath, Maine\\" 1.

Fran√ßois-Marie Bissot was born in Montreal to Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes and Marguerite Forestier on June 17, 1700. He was named Fran√ßois Margane after his godfather and uncle. In 1717, he joined his father at Kekionga, a village of the Miami People near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana in northeastern Indiana. His father was in charge of promoting loyalty to the French among the Miami Indians. By 1718 Vincennes was working among the Ouiatenon Miamis on the upper Ouabache River. When his father died in 1719, Fran√ßois seemed to be the natural replacement. In May 1722, Vincennes was commissioned an Ensign and took control of Fort Ouiatenon near present-day Lafayette, Indiana.Cayton 1996, p. 5. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1730 and was made commandant in what is now southern Indiana. The area became increasingly important to New France in keeping their connection to Louisiana open and keeping British traders out. Vincennes was central to this endeavour and also became increasingly attached to the Louisiana contingent. He was commissioned to build a trading post on the Wabash River and established Fort Vincennes where the modern city of Vincennes, Indiana is located. Although the colonial government of Louisiana did not support him, Vincennes convinced local Piankeshaw to establish a village at the post. In 1733, he married the daughter of Philippe Longpr√© of Kaskaskia. They had two daughters, Marie Therese and Catherine, the first children of his new village.Derleth 1968, p. 9. On 25 March 1736, Fran√ßois-Marie Bissot de Vincennes was burned by the Chickasaw Indians along with other captive French at the village of Ogoula Tchetoka, near the present site of Fulton, Mississippi,Zoltvany 2000.Roy 1923, p. 18. though the historical marker in Vincennes (pictured in this article) gives the location as Fulton, Tennessee.

Kurepa (1933‚Äì2000) was a renowned Serbian atomic physicist. Biography Kurepa was born on 1 May 1933 in town of Baƒçka Palanka, Vojvodina, Serbia. In 1956, he began his working at the Vinca Nuclear Institute in Belgrade. Kurepa graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Mathematics under Aleksandar Milojeviƒá, and later electrical engineering in the United Kingdom, under J. D. Craggs. His thesis topic was slow electron scattering off atoms and molecules. Kurepa then joined the University of Belgrade physics department as an assistant professor. He became a professor in 1981 and continued in that position until his retirement in 1998. Kurepa often worked at Universities abroad, including Germany and the UK. Kurepa's pedagogical work at the undergraduate and graduate levels was highly valued. He was a coauthor of 12 university and 4 high-school textbooks. In 1964, Kurepa joined the newly founded Institute of Physics at the University of Belgrade as a research scientist. There, he started the Atomic Physics Laboratory. Due primarily to Kurepa's leadership, the Atomic Physics Laboratory gained an international reputation in the field of electron collisions with atoms or molecules. At present, about a dozen of Kurepa's students are scientists and professors at leading universities in Australia, Belgium, the UK, France, Germany, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United States. He was an outstanding organizer, coordinating numerous domestic and international conferences. He served as president of many Yugoslavian academic institutions. In 1994, Kurepa was elected the corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. During the isolation of Yugoslavian scientists from the rest of the world due to United Nations sanctions, Kurepa organized a very successful meeting of SANU in 1997 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the electron. Kurepa fought for democracy in Yugoslavia. A vigorous adversary of Slobodan Milosevic's regime, Kurepa founded in 1997 the Association of University Professors and Scientists, with the principal aim of fighting for the recovery of basic university freedoms in Serbia. He was AUPR's first president. The association has been especially active since 1998, when the University Act was introduced to abolish the autonomy of Serbian universities. AUPR has organized protest meetings at Serbian universities, published statements regarding university autonomy and freedom of opinion, appealed to international academic associations for intervention with the Serbian government, and engaged in similar activities. During the 2000 electoral campaign, Kurepa traveled around Serbia with the students' movement Otpor!.

Biography Gaubert was born in Cahors. He became one of the most prominent French musicians between the two World Wars. After a prominent career as a flautist with the Paris Op√©ra, he was appointed in 1919, at the age of forty, to three positions that placed him at the very centre of French musical life: * Professor of flute in the Conservatoire de Paris (teacher of Marcel Moyse), * Principal conductor of the Paris Op√©ra * Principal conductor of the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire. In 1907 he participated in the first performance of Maurice Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet. Among his recordings as conductor, one that he made of C√©sar Franck's Symphony in D minor (with the Conservatoire forces) is particularly notable. Gaubert's compositions are not especially innovative, but his work benefited from the examples of Franck, Ravel, and Debussy. Na√Øla, his opera in three acts, premiered at the Palais Garnier on 7 April 1927. Three of his ballets had their first performances at that venue, as well.

Early life Sampson was born in Derry, Ireland to an affluent Anglican family. He attended Trinity College Dublin and studied law at Lincoln's Inn in London.Beale, Charles Currier. William Sampson, Lawyer and Stenographer (1907). In his twenties, he briefly visited an uncle in North Carolina. In 1790 he married Grace Clark; they had two sons, William and John, and a daughter, Catherine Anne. Admitted to the Irish Bar, Sampson became Junior Counsel to John Philpot Curran, and helped him provide legal defences for many members of the Society of United Irishmen. A member of the Church of Ireland, Sampson was disturbed by anti-Catholic violence and contributed writings to the Society's newspapers. He was arrested at the time of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, imprisoned, and compelled to leave Ireland for exile in Europe. Shipwrecked at Pwllheli (he spelt it \\"Pulhelly\\") in Wales, he made his way to exile in Oporto, Portugal, where he was again arrested, imprisoned in Lisbon, and then expelled. After living some years in France, and then Hamburg, he fled the approach of Napoleon's armies to England where he was re-arrested. After unsuccessfully petitioning for a return to Ireland, he arrived in New York City on 4 July 1806. The Catholic Question in America In America, Sampson successfully continued his career in the law, eventually sending for his family. He set up a business publishing detailed accounts of the court proceedings in cases with popular appeal. In 1809 he reported on the case of a Navy Lieutenant Renshaw prosecuted for dueling. That same year he handled a case against Amos and Demis Broad, accused of brutally beating their slave, Betty, and her 3-year-old daughter where Sampson succeeded in having both slaves manumitted. The authorities in Ireland had disbarred Sampson, which caused him some bitter amusement, as it didn't affect his work in the United States. Sampson's most important case in America was in 1813 and is referred to as \\"The Catholic Question in America\\". Police investigating the misdemeanor of receiving stolen goods questioned the suspects' priest, the Reverend Mr. Kohlman; he declined to given any information that he had heard in confession. The priest was called to testify at the trial in the Court of General Sessions in the City of New-York; he again declined. The issue whether to compel the testimony was fully briefed and carefully argued on both sides, with a detailed examination of the common law; in the end, the confessional privilege was accepted for the first time in a court of the United States. He died in December 1836 and was buried in the Riker Family graveyard on Long Island in what is now East Elmhurst, Queens, New York.http://www.rikerhome.com He was later reinterred in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he is now buried in the same plot as Matilda Witherington Tone and William Theobald Wolfe Tone, the wife and son of the Irish revolutionary Wolfe Tone, and his daughter Catherine, the wife of William Theobald Wolfe Tone.

They include the various marine mammals who dwell in oceans, as well as various freshwater species, such as the European otter. They are not a taxon and are not unified by any distinct biological grouping, but rather their dependence on and integral relation to aquatic ecosystems. The level of dependence on aquatic life varies greatly among species. Among freshwater taxa, the Amazonian manatee and river dolphins are completely aquatic and fully dependent on aquatic ecosystems. Semiaquatic freshwater taxa include the Baikal seal, which feeds underwater but rests, molts, and breeds on land; and the capybara and hippopotamus which are able to venture in and out of water in search of food. Mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle vary considerably between species. River dolphins and manatees are both fully aquatic and therefore are completely tethered to a life in the water. Seals are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, many other aquatic mammals, such as hippopotamus, capybara, and water shrews, are much less adapted to aquatic living. Likewise, their diet ranges considerably as well, anywhere from aquatic plants and leaves to small fish and crustaceans. They play major roles in maintaining aquatic ecosystems, beavers especially. Aquatic mammals were the target for commercial industry, leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as beavers. Their pelts, suited for conserving heat, were taken during the fur trade and made into coats and hats. Other aquatic mammals, such as the Indian rhinoceros, were targets for sport hunting and had a sharp population decline in the 1900s. After it was made illegal, many aquatic mammals became subject to poaching. Other than hunting, aquatic mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased river traffic, most notably in the Yangtze river, causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and aquatic mammals, and damming of rivers may land migratory aquatic mammals in unsuitable areas or destroy habitat upstream. The industrialization of rivers led to the extinction of the Chinese river dolphin, with the last confirmed sighting in 2004.

It seems to have been adapted to water much like a beaver, with teeth different in many ways from all other docodonts, presumably due to a difference in diet. Most docodonts had teeth specialized for an omnivorous diet. The teeth of Castorocauda suggest that the animal was a piscivore, feeding on fish and small invertebrates. The first two molars had cusps in a straight row, eliminating the grinding function suggesting that they were strictly for gripping and not for chewing. This feature of three cusps in a row is similar to the ancestral condition in mammal relatives (as seen in triconodonts), but is almost certainly a derived character in Castorocauda. These first molars were also recurved in a manner adapted to hold slippery prey once grasped. These teeth are very similar to the teeth seen in mesonychids, an extinct group of semiaquatic carnivorous ungulates, and resemble, to a lesser degree, the teeth of seals. Illustration of Castorocauda lutrasimilis, a semiaquatic mammal from the Jurassic Another docodontan, the Late Jurassic Haldanodon, has been suggested to be a platypus or desman-like swimmer and burrower, being well adapted to dig and swim and occurring in a wetland environment.Thomas Martin, Postcranial anatomy of Haldanodon exspectatus (Mammalia, Docodonta) from the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) of Portugal and its bearing for mammalian evolution, Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg, Senckenberganlage 25, 60325 Frankfurt am Main, Germany Received October 2004; accepted for publication March 2005 The tritylodontid Kayentatherium has been suggested to be semiaquatic. Unlike Castorocauda and Haldanodon, it was an herbivore, being probably beaver or capybara-like in habits.Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, Forerunners of Mammals: Radiation ‚Ä¢ Histology ‚Ä¢ Biology, Indiana University Press, 18/11/2011 Another lineage of Mesozoic mammals, the eutriconodonts, have been suggested to be aquatic animals with mixed results. Astroconodon occurred abundantly in freshwater lacustrine deposits and its molars were originally interpreted as being similar to those of piscivorous mammals like cetaceans and pinnipeds; by extension some researchers considered the possibility that all eutriconodonts were aquatic piscivores.Bob H. Slaughter, Astroconodon, the Cretaceous Triconodont, Journal of Mammalogy, Vol. 50, No. 1 (Feb., 1969), pp. 102-107 However, Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and other researchers have latter found that the triconodont molars of eutriconodonts were more suited for a carnassial-like shearing action than the piercing and gripping function of piscivorous mammal molars, occluding instead of interlocking, and that Astroconodon's aquatic occurrences may be of little significance when most terrestrial tetrapod fossils are found in lacustrine environments anyway.Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, Richard L. Cifelli, Zhe-Xi Luo (2004). \\"Chapter 7: Eutriconodontans\\". Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs: origins, evolution, and structure. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 216‚Äì248. . However, two other eutriconodonts, Dyskritodon and Ichthyoconodon, occur in marine deposits with virtually no dental erosion, implying that they died in situ and are thus truly aquatic mammals. Nonetheless, Ichthyoconodon may not be aquatic, but instead a gliding or even flying mammal. More recently, Yanoconodon and Liaoconodon have been interpreted as semiaquatic, bearing a long body and paddle-like limbs.Meng Chen, Gregory Philip Wilson, A multivariate approach to infer locomotor modes in Mesozoic mammals, Article in Paleobiology 41(02) ¬∑ February 2015 DOI: 10.1017/pab.2014.14 A metatherian, the stagodontid Didelphodon, has been suggested to be aquatic, due to molar and skeleton similarities to sea otters. Cenozoic An extinct genus, Satherium, is believed to be ancestral to South American river otters, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The South American continent houses the otter genus Lontra: the giant otter, the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. The most popular theory of the origins of Hippopotamidae suggests that hippos and whales shared a common ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls around 60 million years ago (mya). This hypothesized ancestral group likely split into two branches around 54 mya. One branch would evolve into cetaceans, possibly beginning about 52 mya, with the protowhale Pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, and all branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants. River dolphins are thought to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is paraphyletic. For example, Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins. Illustration of Prorastomus, a sirenian from the Eocene Sirenians, along with Proboscidea (elephants), group together with the extinct Desmostylia and likely the extinct Embrithopoda to form the Tethytheria. Tethytheria is thought to have evolved from primitive hoofed mammals (\\"condylarths\\") along the shores of the ancient Tethys Ocean. Tethytheria, combined with Hyracoidea (hyraxes), forms a clade called Paenungulata. Paenungulata and Tethytheria (especially the latter) are among the least controversial mammalian clades, with strong support from morphological and molecular interpretations. That is, elephants, hyraxes, and manatees share a common ancestry. The ancestry of Sirenia is distinct from that of Cetacea and Pinnipedia, although they are thought to have evolved an aquatic lifestyle around the same time. The oldest fossil of the modern platypus dates back to about 100,000 years ago, during the Quaternary period. The extinct monotremes Teinolophos and Steropodon were once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus, but more recent studies show that platypi are more related to the modern echidnas than to these ancient forms and that at least Teinolophos was a rather different mammal lacking several speciations seen in platypi. However, the last common ancestor between platypi and echidnas probably was aquatic, and echidnas thus secondarily became terrestrial. Monotrematum sudamericanum is currently the oldest aquatic monotreme known. It has been found in Argentina, indicating monotremes were present in the supercontinent of Gondwana when the continents of South America and Australia were joined via Antarctica, or that monotremes existed along the shorelines of Antarctica in the early Cenozoic. =Marine mammals= Marine mammals are aquatic mammals that rely on the ocean for their existence. They include animals such as sea lions, whales, dugongs, sea otters and polar bears. Like other aquatic mammals, they do not represent a biological grouping. The humpback whale is a fully aquatic marine mammal Marine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle vary considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate ocean dwellers. Pinnipeds are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Likewise, their diet ranges considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat small fish, and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large. They, namely sea otters and polar bears, play important roles in maintaining marine ecosystems, especially through regulation of prey populations. Their role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern considering 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened. Marine mammals were first hunted by aboriginal peoples for food and other resources. They were also the target for commercial industry, leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of Steller's sea cow and the Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers, however the northern elephant seal has a genetic bottleneck; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals, dolphins especially, can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrades arctic environments. Adaptations Mammals evolved on land, so all aquatic and semiaquatic mammals have brought many terrestrial adaptations into the waters. They do not breathe underwater as fish do, so their respiratory systems had to protect the body from the surrounding water; valvular nostrils and an intranarial larynx exclude water while breathing and swallowing. To navigate and detect prey in murky and turbid waters, aquatic mammals have developed a variety of sensory organs: for example, manatees have elongated and highly sensitive whiskers which are used to detect food and other vegetation directly front of them, and toothed whales have evolved echolocation. Aquatic mammals also display a variety of locomotion styles. Cetaceans excel in streamlined body shape and the up-and-down movements of their flukes make them fast swimmers; the tucuxi, for example, can reach speeds of . The considerably slower sirenians can also propel themselves with their fluke, but they can also walk on the bottom with their forelimbs. The earless seals (Phocidae) swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for steering. They are clumsy on land, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced; when confronted with predators, they retreat to the water as freshwater phocids have no aquatic predators. The pygmy hippopotamus has four weight-bearing limbs, and can walk on land like a fully terrestrial mammal. Some aquatic mammals have retained four weight- bearing limbs (e.g. hippopotamuses, beavers, otters, muskrats) and can walk on land like fully terrestrial mammals. The long and thin legs of a moose limit exposure to and friction from water in contrast to hippopotamuses who keep most of their body submerged and have short and thick legs. The semiaquatic pygmy hippopotamus can walk quickly on a muddy underwater surface thanks to robust muscles and because all toes are weight-bearing. Some aquatic mammals with flippers (e.g. seals) are amphibious and regularly leave the water, sometimes for extended periods, and maneuver on land by undulating their bodies to move on land, similar to the up-and-down body motion used underwater by fully aquatic mammals (e.g. dolphins and manatees). Beavers, muskrats, otters, and capybara have fur, one of the defining mammalian features, that is long, oily, and waterproof in order to trap air to provide insulation. In contrast, other aquatic mammals, such as dolphins, manatees, seals, and hippopotamuses, have lost their fur in favor of a thick and dense epidermis, and a thickened fat layer (blubber) in response to hydrodynamic requirements. Wading and bottom-feeding animals (e.g. moose and manatee) need to be heavier than water in order to keep contact with the floor or to stay submerged, surface-living animals (e.g. otters) need the opposite, and free-swimming animals living in open waters (e.g. dolphins) need to be neutrally buoyant in order to be able to swim up and down the water column. Typically, thick and dense bone is found in bottom feeders and low bone density is associated with mammals living in deep water. The shape and function of the eyes in aquatic animals are dependent on water depth and light exposure: limited light exposure results in a retina similar to that of nocturnal terrestrial mammals. Additionally, cetaceans have two areas of high ganglion cell concentration (\\"best-vision areas\\"), where other aquatic mammals (e.g. seals, manatees, otters) only have one. Among non-placental mammals, which cannot give birth to fully developed young,Michael L. Power,Jay Schulkin. The Evolution Of The Human Placenta. pp. 68‚Äì. some adjustments have been made for an aquatic lifestyle. The yapok has a backwards-facing pouch which seals off completely when the animal is underwater, while the platypus deposits its young on a burrow on land. Ecology =Keystone species= Beaver dams restrict water- flow, creating a pond Beaver ponds have a profound effect on the surrounding ecosystem. Their first and foremost ecological function is as a reservoir for times of drought, and prevent drying of riverbeds. In the event of a flood, beaver ponds slow down water-flow which reduces erosion on the surrounding soil. Beaver dams hold sediment, which reduces turbidity and thereby improving overall water quality downstream. This supplies other animals with cleaner drinking water and prevents degradation of spawning grounds for fish. However, the slower water speed and lack of shade from trees (that have since been cut down to construct the dam), results in the overall temperature increasing. They also house predatory zooplankton which help break down detritus and control algae populations. =Diet= Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood of quaking aspen, cottonwood, willow, alder, birch, maple and cherry trees. They also eat sedges, pondweed, and water lilies. Beavers do not hibernate, but rather they store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. The dams they build flood areas of surrounding forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees. They prefer aspen and poplar, but will also take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash, hornbeam and occasionally pine and spruce. They will also eat cattails, water lilies and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring. Indian rhinoceros are grazers. Their diets consist almost entirely of grasses, but they also eat leaves, branches of shrubs and trees, fruits, and submerged and floating aquatic plants. They feed in the mornings and evenings. They use their prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant, with legs on both sides and using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down to the level of the mouth. Manatees make seasonal movements synchronized with the flood regime of the Amazon Basin. They are found in flooded forests and meadows during the flood season when food is abundant, and move to deep lakes during the dry season. The Amazonian manatee has the smallest degree of rostral deflection (25¬∞ to 41¬∞) among sirenians, an adaptation to feed closer to the water surface. A moose's diet often depends on its location, but they seem to prefer the new growths from deciduous trees with a high sugar content, such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. They also eat many aquatic plants such as lilies and water milfoil. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs, allowing it to reach plants off the ground. Moose are excellent swimmers and are known to wade into water to eat aquatic plants. Moose are thus attracted to marshes and river banks during warmer months as both provide suitable vegetation to eat and water to bathe in. Moose have been known to dive underwater to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complex snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only deer that are capable of feeding underwater. A moose in Siberia feeding on aquatic plants Hippopotamuses leave the water at dusk and travel inland, sometimes up to , to graze on short grasses, their main source of food. They spend four to five hours grazing and can consume of grass each night. Like almost any herbivore, they consume other plants if presented with them, but their diet consists almost entirely of grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. The pygmy hippopotamus emerges from the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces. The pygmy hippo spends about six hours a day foraging for food, and they do not eat aquatic vegetation to a significant extent and rarely eat grass because it is uncommon in the thick forests they inhabit. The bulk of a pygmy hippo's diet consists of ferns, broad-leaved plants and fruits that have fallen to the forest floor. The wide variety of plants pygmy hippos have been observed eating suggests that they will eat any plants available. This diet is of higher quality than that of the common hippopotamus. The Amazon river dolphin has the most diverse diet among cetaceans, consisting of at least 53 species of fish. They mainly feed on croakers, cichlids, tetras, and piranhas, but they may also target freshwater crabs and river turtles. South Asian river dolphins mainly eat fish (such as carp, catfish, and freshwater sharks) and invertebrates, mainly prawns. Generally, all aquatic desmans, shrews, and voles make quick dives and catch small fish and invertebrates. The giant otter shrew, for example, makes quick dives that last for seconds and grabs small crabs (usually no bigger than across). The Lutrine opossum is the most carnivorous opossum, usually consuming small birds, rodents, and invertebrates. Water voles mainly eat grass and plants near the water and at times, they will also consume fruits, bulbs, twigs, buds, and roots. However, a population of water voles living in Wiltshire and Lincolnshire, England have started eating frogs' legs and discarding the bodies. Interactions with humans =Exploitation= A beaver pelt in the Fur Trade Museum Fur robes were blankets of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. The pelts were called castor gras in French and \\"coat beaver\\" in English, and were soon recognized by the newly developed felt-hat making industry as particularly useful for felting. Some historians, seeking to explain the term castor gras, have assumed that coat beaver was rich in human oils from having been worn so long (much of the top-hair was worn away through usage, exposing the valuable under-wool), and that this is what made it attractive to the hatters. This seems unlikely, since grease interferes with the felting of wool, rather than enhancing it. By the 1580s, beaver \\"wool\\" was the major starting material of the French felt-hatters. Hat makers began to use it in England soon after, particularly after Huguenot refugees brought their skills and tastes with them from France. Sport hunting of the Indian rhinoceros became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Indian rhinos were hunted relentlessly and persistently. Reports from the middle of the 19th century claim that some British military officers in Assam individually shot more than 200 rhinos. By 1908, the population in Kaziranga had decreased to around 12 individuals. In the early 1900s, the species had declined to near extinction. Poaching for rhinoceros horn became the single most important reason for the decline of the Indian rhino after conservation measures were put in place from the beginning of the 20th century, when legal hunting ended. From 1980 to 1993, 692 rhinos were poached in India. In India's Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, 41 rhinos were killed in 1983, virtually the entire population of the sanctuary. By the mid-1990s, poaching had rendered the species extinct there. In 1950, Chitwan‚Äôs forest and grasslands extended over more than and were home to about 800 rhinos. When poor farmers from the mid-hills moved to the Chitwan Valley in search of arable land, the area was subsequently opened for settlement, and poaching of wildlife became rampant. The Chitwan population has repeatedly been jeopardized by poaching; in 2002 alone, poachers killed 37 animals to saw off and sell their valuable horns. Otters have been hunted for their pelts since at least the 1700s. There has been a long history of otter pelts being worn around the world. In China it was standard for the royalty to wear robes made from them. People that were financially high in status also wore them. Otters have also been hunted using dogs, specifically the otterhound. In modern times, TRAFFIC, a joint program of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reported that otters are at serious risk in Southeast Asia and have disappeared from parts of their former range. This decline in populations is due to hunting to supply the demand for skins. =Habitat degradation= The Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill was a major producer of industrial waste for Lake Baikal. One problem at Lake Baikal is the introduction of pollutants into the ecosystem. Pesticides such as DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane, as well as industrial waste, mainly from the Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill, are thought to have been the cause of several disease epidemics among Baikal seal populations. The chemicals are speculated to concentrate up the food chain and weaken the Baikal seal's immune system, making them susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper and the plague, which was the cause of a serious Baikal seal epidemic that resulted in the deaths of thousands of animals in 1997 and 1999. Baikal seal pups have higher levels of DDT and PCB than known in any other population of European or Arctic earless seal. In the 1940s, beavers were brought from Canada to the island of Tierra Del Fuego in southern Chile and Argentina, for commercial fur production. However, the project failed and the beavers, ten pairs, were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the island, and to other islands in the region, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. They are now considered a serious invasive species in the region, due to their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made for their eradication. In some European countries, such as Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, the muskrat is considered an invasive pest, as its burrowing damages the dikes and levees on which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding. In those countries, it is trapped, poisoned, and hunted to attempt to keep the population down. Muskrats also eat corn and other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies. Dead trees as a result of the construction of a beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego Urban and agricultural development, increased damming, and increased use of hydroelectric power in rivers in countries such as C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana are threats to the African manatee's habitat and life, and thick congestion of boats in waterways may cause them to have a deadly run-in with the vessels. However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, often strand manatees in an unsuitable habitat. Some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and nets intended for catching sharks. The Amazonian manatee is at risk from pollution, accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets, and the degradation of vegetation by soil erosion resulting from deforestation. Additionally, the indiscriminate release of mercury in mining activities threatens the entire aquatic ecosystem of the Amazon Basin. As China developed economically, pressure on the Chinese river dolphin grew significantly. Industrial and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze. The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations. Ship traffic multiplied, boats grew in size, and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets. Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers. Stocks of the dolphin's prey declined drastically in the late 20th century, with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre- industrial levels. In the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals, but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. On December 13, 2006, the baiji was declared functionally extinct, after a 45-day search by leading experts in the field failed to find a single specimen. The last verified sighting was in 2004. =As food= Moose are hunted as a game species in many of the countries where they are found. While the flesh has protein levels similar to those of other comparable red meats (e.g. beef, deer and elk), it has a low fat content, and the fat that is present consists of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats rather than saturated fats. Cadmium levels are high in moose liver and kidneys, with the result that consumption of these organs from moose more than one year old is prohibited in Finland. Cadmium intake has been found to be elevated amongst all consumers of moose meat, though the meat was found to contribute only slightly to the daily cadmium intake. However the consumption of moose liver or kidneys significantly increased cadmium intake, with the study revealing that heavy consumers of moose organs have a relatively narrow safety margin below the levels which would probably cause adverse health effects. In the 17th century, based on a question raised by the Bishop of Quebec, the Roman Catholic Church ruled that the beaver was a fish (beaver flesh was a part of the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival) for purposes of dietary law. Therefore, the general prohibition on the consumption of meat on Fridays did not apply to beaver meat. This is similar to the Church's classification of other semiaquatic rodents, such as the capybara and muskrat.

They were partly funded by the government as part of an initiative to help British industry recover from World War I. One hundred steel-bodied cars were built: 40 driving motors, 12 control trailers and 48 trailers with the first train entering service on 23 December 1920. The cars were built with manually-operated sliding doors. They had non-standard equipment that precluded multiple-unit operation with any other type of train, and had significantly more powerful motors which resulted in acceleration of (which was considerably better than existing District Railway rolling stock). This led to some initial operating difficulties as the benefits of the new trains were not properly realised. The front ends of driving cabs had two distinctive oval windows separated by the centre door. This was a less-than-ideal design, because it limited the driver's forward view in what is now considered a cramped, ergonomically unfriendly cab. As built, the initial design of the stock was unwelcoming with a cold steel appearance, seats covered in a Rexine-type material and roof-to-floor grab- poles for standing commuters. Frank Pick, the innovator of so much change on the Underground system, commissioned a well-known artist who improved the appearance of the upholstery, supplied armrests between individual seats, and replaced the grab-poles with hanging straps. The stock had both first- and third-class accommodation at this time. Between 1938 and 1940 the control trailers were all rebuilt into driving motor cars, and the doors converted to air-operation with passenger push-button control. In 1950 and 1951, after a final rehabilitation programme (which included the provision of door-locking), the F Stock was transferred to the Metropolitan line where it operated services between Uxbridge and London, even working the occasional service to Amersham and Watford. The first rehabilitated train ran on 27 February 1951. Because of their powerful motors the F Stock was often used for semi-fast services in the morning peak (calling at all stations from Uxbridge to Rayners Lane, then stopping only at Harrow on the Hill before Finchley Road), with return services in the evening rush hour. When running fast, trains notably tended to roll and lurch along the track. Some four-car sets also worked the East London Line during the 1950s with maintenance being undertaken at Neasden depot. The F Stock was replaced by A60 and A62 Stock in the early 1960s. A few units continued on the East London Line with the last set operating on 7 September 1963 (the last Uxbridge service had operated on 15 March 1963). The F stock were initially nicknamed \\"Dreadnoughts\\" but they quickly became known as \\"Tanks\\", possibly because of their all-steel construction or because they had been built in workshops that had previously produced tanks during the war. None survived into preservation.

The College is administered by the Catholic Education Office of the Diocese of Lismore. In the city of Lismore the four largest industries by employment are the retail sector, health care, education and agriculture. St John's College, originally an agricultural secondary school, has a major part in two of these sectors and of course participates indirectly in the others as well. The school's name is often shortened to \\"Woodlawn\\" rather than being named fully. The school was founded by the Marists who continue to play a role in the running of the school. The first lay Rector (Principal) was Glenn Roff, appointed in 2001 when the Marist Fathers withdrew from St John's.  History  St John's College, Woodlawn, was founded from St. Patrick's College, Wellington, New Zealand in 1931. The Marists who began the school themselves originated in France in the early 19th century. St John's College was formally opened in 1931 as a Boarding and Day school on land which was donated by Margaret Buckley. The first Rector of the school was Thomas Segrief S.M, Followed by Frs James Bell, John Kennedy, John Webber, Steven Maloney, Sid Mitchell, John Webber, Garry Reynolds, Lou Molloy, John Worthington, William Ryder, Ray Chapman ‚Äì all priests of the Society of Mary and the current Principal is Aaron Beach. The College was described in the Northern Star on 25 May 1931: For many years, St John was primarily a boarding school for boys. While most students came from country NSW, during the 1960s and 1970s, a substantial number of students came from Sabah, Malaysia. = The 75th anniversary = St John's College Woodlawn celebrated its 75th Anniversary in 2006. The College held many events throughout the year to celebrate, ranging from the first \\"Woodlawn Race Day\\", to \\"St John's Youth Day\\" and formal ceremonies. The opening of the renovated Chapel was a central part of the ceremonies, with hundreds of Alumni returning to be a part of the celebrations. After the Woodlawn Race Day (also known as the Woodlawn Cup), the College executive in association with the Parents and Friends executive decided to hold the day annually.

John Christopher Drumgoole (August 15, 1816 ‚Äì March 28, 1888) was an Irish American Roman Catholic priest who was known for his work in caring for and educating orphaned and abandoned children in New York City, especially homeless newsboys. In 1883, he founded Mount Loretto, an orphanage and vocational school for boys in a then-rural section of Staten Island which later grew into a large complex that housed and educated thousands of boys and girls in more than a century of existence. As of 2015, the organization that Drumgoole founded continued to run programs that benefit needy children on a portion of the Mount Loretto property. Life Drumgoole first sheltered needy children at St. Mary's Church on the Lower East Side, where he was a sexton John Drumgoole was born in Granard, County Longford, Ireland, on August 15, 1816. His father, a cobbler, died in 1822. John came to the United States at the age of 9 to join his mother, who had emigrated previously. His mother worked as a maid. John became a shoemaker to help support her. In 1844, he became sexton/janitor of St. Mary's, New York City's third Roman Catholic parish, founded in 1826 and located in the poor Lower East Side neighborhood. Drumgoole grew concerned for the many homeless and orphaned children who lived on the streets of New York City after the Great Famine in Ireland and then the American Civil War in the United States. For 21 years, he provided shelter for many of them in the basement of the church.Fitzpatrick, Mallick. \\"John C. Drumgoole.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. December 6, 2013 Drumgoole became a United States citizen in 1838. He had long wished to enter the priesthood, but waited until provision could be made for his mother. In 1863, he commenced his studies, first at St. John's College in Rose Hill, and then at St. Francis Xavier's. He entered the Seminary of Our Lady of Angels, near Niagara Falls, in 1865. He was ordained 1869, aged 53. In 1871, he was placed in charge of the \\"Newsboys' Lodging House\\", a project of the St. Vincent de Paul Society located at 53 Warren Street in Manhattan. Under his leadership, this program expanded, and he soon found the building inadequate for the needs of his newsboy charges. Seeking funds to build a larger home for newsboys, he founded a new organization, the St. Joseph's Union, and began publishing \\"The Homeless Child and Messenger of St. Joseph's Union\\". People from all over the world purchased subscriptions to this publication for 25 cents per year and thereby became members of the union. It was with these funds that he was able to build a new mission house at the corner of Great Jones and Lafayette streets, which came to be known as the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin. The cornerstone of the Manhattan building was laid in 1879. The plot of land, which was previously occupied by a Protestant church, cost $70,000 and the building cost $160,000 to build. It was occupied by 1881. Though the building was designed to provide light and air to each resident so as to avoid the spread of influenza and tuberculosis, which was common in the tenements, Drumgoole came to feel that the general environment of the City at the time was not healthy for the younger children, so he sought out a more rural setting. In 1882, he purchased land on Staten Island and founded the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin at Mount Loretto, which he named as a tribute to the Sisters who accompanied him there to teach the children. Mount Loretto was designed to be a self-sufficient farm. Death Father Drumgoole used to divide his time between the Mission's facilities in Manhattan and at Mount Loretto. On Sunday, March 11, 1888, he boarded a Staten Island Rapid Transit train at the Pleasant Plains station, very near the orphanage, and rode it to the ferry to Manhattan at St. George. Upon arriving, he found that no ferries were running because the Great Blizzard of 1888 had begun and was causing wind gusts that may have exceeded 80 miles per hour in some places. To return to Mount Loretto, he hired a horse and gig and drove through blizzard. Though he arrived safely, he soon developed a cold that later progressed to pneumonia, even though he continued to work. He collapsed on March 28, while preparing to say Mass at the Mission's building in Manhattan. Drumgoole's will left everything he had to the Mission. Legacy Drumgoole Plaza Father Drumgoole was a hero of the newsboys who thronged the area when Park Row was the headquarters of New York City's major newspapers, including The New York Times, and was considered an unofficial patron saint of the homeless, orphans, and the less fortunate. In 1894, a statue was erected in Fr. Drumgoole's honor at Lafayette Street, the site of the Manhattan Mission.\\"Father Drumgoole Honored\\", New York Times, April 16, 1894 It was later moved to Mount Loretto in 1920. The Mission of the Immaculate Virgin has been on its current site in the Pleasant Plains section of Staten Island since 1883. Mount Loretto, an orphanage for boys and later girls as well, was run by the mission for many years.\\"A Brief History of MIV\\", Mission of the Immaculate Virgin. In tribute to Fr. Drumgoole, several things were also named in his honor. Drumgoole Plaza, a New York City park, is named in his honor, as are the service roads (Drumgoole Road West/East) of the Korean War Veterans Parkway on Staten Island.

He is sometimes credited as Lemon. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, he still resides there. He is the son of Milagros \\"Mili\\" Qui√±ones, from Puerto Rico, and Peter Andersen, a Norwegian-American from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Growing up in poverty, as a teenager Lemon experienced the successive deaths of his stepfather, father, and mother from complications of heroin abuse and AIDS, leaving him and his older brother orphaned and forced to fend for themselves. Lemon became involved in serious crime, but his growing compassion first for hip hop and then acting, and a succession of gifted mentors who recognized and nurtured his theatrical talent, resulted in his development into the powerful artist portrayed in County of Kings and Lemon. Today a much-lauded \\"wordsmith who thinks deeply about the sounds of syllables\\", Lemon Andersen's writing and live performances have received widespread popular and critical acclaim. In his November 2011 TEDYouth talk Please don't take my Air Jordans, Lemon's performance of the title poem by Reg E. Gaines is followed by his own spoken- word riff on the influence of Gaines, Etheridge Knight, and other poets on his creative growth as a poet and spoken word artist.  Poetry  As a poet Lemon Andersen has the most aired episodes on HBO's Def Poetry, eight times in six seasons, and was an original cast member of the Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam on Broadway (2002-2003), for which he won the Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event in 2003 and the Drama Desk nomination for Unique Theatrical Experience that same year. His poetry collections include Ready Made Real: Poems (2004) and County of Kings (2009), both of which were published independently by County of Kings Publishing.  Spoken word  Andersen has traveled the spoken-word and theater scene for the last decade performing and selling out venues such as the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, Apollo Theater, Chicago Theater, and Hollywood‚Äôs Kodak Theater. On July 2, 2005 he performed in front of 500,000 people at Philadelphia‚Äôs Live 8 concert. Nike also chose him to write a piece to help them sign young basketball star LeBron James.  Movies  In film, Lemon appeared in The Soloist (2009), directed by Joe Wright and starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx. He has shot four movies with Spike Lee, including Sucker Free City (2004), She Hate Me (2004), Inside Man (2006) (appearing opposite Denzel Washington and Clive Owen), and Miracle at St. Anna (2008). More recently, he is featured in the internationally acclaimed documentary film Lemon, screened in 2012-2013 at film festivals and performing arts centers across North America. It premiered on television as the fourth episode in America's PBS Voces series on October 19, 2012.  Theater  Lemon Andersen's theater credits include Slanguage, directed by Jo Bonney, The Ride at PS 122, and U at the Mark Taper Forum, as well as teaching performance art workshops at different colleges, universities and institutions including Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Sing Sing Prison. He has recently starred in a touring one person show titled County of Kings: The Beautiful Struggle, which was developed and produced through The American Place Theatre's Literature to Life program. Since its premier in 2009, performances have been staged to rave reviews at campuses and theaters across the U.S. and on three continents. This coming-of- age memoir, which mixes poetry and prose, was the grand prize winner in the 2010 New York Book Festival.  Playwriting  As a Baryshnikov Arts Center Resident Artist from November 26-December 1, 2012, Andersen worked with director Elise Thoron and sound designer Robert Kaplowitz on the score for his new play ToasT, focusing on African-American poetic narratives in the setting of Attica Prison at the time of the 1971 riots. ToasT was commissioned by the Sundance Institute and recently showed, as ToasT (Work in Progress), in Off- Broadway's Under the Radar Festival at The Public Theater in Lower Manhattan, New York. Video Games Lemon was the voice actor for Pharaoh, Boxcar and Axel in The Warriors and The Crowd of Liberty City in Grand Theft Auto IV.

One WTC is the tallest building in the United States, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the sixth-tallest in the world. The supertall structure has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the World Trade Center site, on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center. The building is bounded by West Street to the west, Vesey Street to the north, Fulton Street to the south, and Washington Street to the east. The building's architect is David Childs, whose firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) also designed the Burj Khalifa and the Willis Tower. The construction of below- ground utility relocations, footings, and foundations for the new building began on April 27, 2006. One World Trade Center became the tallest structure in New York City on April 30, 2012, when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building. The tower's steel structure was topped out on August 30, 2012. On May 10, 2013, the final component of the skyscraper's spire was installed, making the building, including its spire, reach a total height of . Its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. The building opened on November 3, 2014; the One World Observatory opened on May 29, 2015. On March 26, 2009, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) confirmed that the building would be officially known by its legal name of \\"One World Trade Center\\", rather than its colloquial name of \\"Freedom Tower\\". The building is 104 standard floors high, but the tower has only 94 actual stories. The new World Trade Center complex will eventually include five high-rise office buildings built along Greenwich Street, as well as the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood. The construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex. Original building (1971‚Äì2001) =Construction= The first One World Trade Center under construction in 1971 The construction of the World Trade Center, of which the Twin Towers (One and Two World Trade Center) were the centerpieces, was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was intended to help revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki. He came up with the idea of building twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York State governments, which supervise the Port Authority, consented to the construction of the World Trade Center at the Radio Row site, located in the lower-west area of Manhattan. To satisfy the New Jersey government, the Port Authority agreed to buy the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed to Port Authority Trans-Hudson), which transported commuters from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan. The towers were designed as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. The framed tube design was introduced by Bangladeshi-American structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan in the 1960s. The design was accomplished by using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space to be used for office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation. Yamasaki also incorporated elements of Islamic architecture in the building's design, having previously designed Saudi Arabia's Dhahran International Airport with the Saudi Binladin Group. Construction of the North Tower (One World Trade Center) began in August 1966; extensive use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process. The first tenants moved into the North Tower in October 1971.Darton, Eric (1999) Divided We Stand: A Biography of New York's World Trade Center, Chapter 6, Basic Books. In the 1970s, four other low-level buildings were built as part of the World Trade Center complex. A seventh building was built in the mid-1980s. =Specifications and operations= After Seven World Trade Center was built in the 1980s, the World Trade Center complex had a total of seven buildings; however, the most notable ones were the main Twin Towers built in the 1970s‚ÄîOne World Trade Center was the North Tower, and Two World Trade Center was the South Tower. Each tower was over high, and occupied about of the total of the site's land. During a press conference in 1973, Yamasaki was asked, \\"Why two 110-story buildings? Why not one 220-story building?\\" His response was, \\"I didn't want to lose the human scale.\\" The original World Trade Center complex in March 2001; the original 1 WTC is the tower on the left with the spire When it was topped out on October, 1971, One World Trade Center became the tallest building in the world, surpassing the Empire State Building, which had held the record for 40 years. The North Tower was tall, and in 1978, a telecommunications antenna was added to the top of the roof; by itself, the antenna was tall. With the -tall antenna, the highest point of the North Tower reached . However, the tower only held its record until , when Chicago's Sears Tower (now Willis Tower), which was tall at the rooftop, was completed. At 110 floors, the World Trade Center towers had more floors than any other building at that time. This number was not surpassed until the construction of the Burj Khalifa (163 floors), which opened in 2010. Of the 110 stories, 8 were set aside as mechanical floors (floors 7/8, 41/42, 75/76, and 108/109), which were 4 two-floor areas that were spaced up the building in even intervals. All the remaining floors were open for tenants. Each floor of the tower had of available space. The North and South tower had of total office space. The entire complex of seven buildings had a combined total of of office space. Lobby of Tower 1, looking south along the east side of the building, August 19, 2000 The complex initially failed to attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World Trade Center, such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous financial condition eased, after which an increasing number of private companies‚Äîmostly financial firms related to Wall Street‚Äîbecame tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center, and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald,\\"Office locations\\". Cantor Fitzgerald. , 2000.

Retrieved on , 2010. The tower's electrical service was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800 volts. The electricity passed through the World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277 volts, and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120 volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of Five World Trade Center. The 110th floor of One World Trade Center (the North Tower) housed radio and television transmission equipment. The roof of the North Tower contained a vast array of transmission antennas, including the center antenna mast, rebuilt by Dielectric Inc. to support DTV in 1999. The center mast contained the television signals for almost all NYC television broadcasters: WCBS-TV 2, WNBC-TV 4, WNYW 5, WABC-TV 7, WWOR-TV 9 Secaucus, WPIX 11, WNET 13 Newark, WPXN-TV 31 and WNJU 47 Linden. It also had four NYC FM broadcasters: WPAT-FM 93.1, WNYC 93.9, WKCR 89.9, and WKTU 103.5. Access to the roof was controlled by the WTC Operations Control Center (OCC), located in the B1 level of the South Tower. After the September 11 attacks of 2001, the broadcasting equipment for the radio and television stations was moved to the Empire State Building. On a typical weekday, a combined total of 50,000 people worked in the North and South Towers,Darton (1999), p. 204 with another 140,000 passing through as visitors. The complex was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048. The Windows on the World restaurant, located on top of the North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States.The Wine News Magazine. Retrieved May 1, 2014. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise. The towers came to be seen as a New York City icon, much like the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Statue of Liberty.Gillespie (1999), p. 5 =Incidents= On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through the core of the building to the 9th and 14th floors, as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors, had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no fire sprinkler systems. Underground damage from the 1993 bombing The first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center occurred on February 26, 1993, at 12:17 p.m., when a Ryder truck filled with of explosives, planted by Ramzi Yousef, detonated in the underground garage of the North Tower.Reeve (1999), p. 10 The blast resulted in a hole through five sublevels. The greatest damage was on levels B1 and B2, with significant structural damage on level B3. Six people were killed, and more than a thousand were injured, as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time. Many people inside the North Tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no emergency lighting, and some took two hours or more to reach safety. September 11 attacks At 8:46 a.m. (EDT) on September 11, 2001, five hijackers affiliated with al-Qaeda crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower between the 93rd and 99th floors. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03 a.m. (EDT), a second group of terrorists crashed the hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower, striking between the 77th and 85th floors. By 9:59 a.m. (EDT), the South Tower collapsed after burning for approximately 56 minutes. After burning for 102 minutes, the North Tower collapsed due to structural failure at 10:28 a.m. (EDT). When the North Tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center, damaging it and starting fires. The fires burned for hours, compromising the building's structural integrity. Seven World Trade Center collapsed at 5:21 p.m. (EDT).World Trade Center Building Performance Study, Ch. 5 WTC 7 ‚Äì section 5.5.4Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, p. xxxvii. Together with a simultaneous attack on the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact.Sunder (2005), p. 48. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died. Current building (2013‚Äìpresent) = Planning and early development= Following the destruction of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of the World Trade Center site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to the World Trade Center site at that time. There was criticism concerning the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan. Only 82 floors would have been habitable, and the total office space of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex would have been reduced by more than in comparison with the original complex. The floor limit was imposed by Silverstein, who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident. Much of the building's height would have consisted of a large, open-air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower, containing wind turbines and \\"sky gardens\\". In a subsequent design, the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original World Trade Center, and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans. In 2002, former New York Governor George Pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect's design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor, Ronald Lauder. A final design for the \\"Freedom Tower\\" was formally unveiled on June 28, 2005. To address security issues raised by the New York City Police Department, a concrete base was added to the design in April of that year. The design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a \\"concrete bunker\\". However, the prisms were later found to be unworkable, as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards. As a result, it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast- resistant glass.\\"Prismatic glass fa√ßade for WTC tower scrapped\\" . The Huffington Post. May 12, 2011. Retrieved June 19, 2011. Contrasting with Libeskind's original plan, the tower's final design tapers octagonally as it rises. Its designers stated that the tower would be a \\"monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna.\\" In 2006, Larry Silverstein commented on a planned completion date: \\"By 2012 we should have a completely rebuilt World Trade Center, more magnificent, more spectacular than it ever was.\\" On April 26, 2006, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin. A formal agreement was drafted the following day, the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the Empire State Building. Construction began in May; a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived. = Construction and later development= One World Trade Center tower construction as of August 7, 2007 One World Trade Center construction as of April 3, 2012, three months before topping off The symbolic cornerstone of One World Trade Center was laid in a ceremony on July 4, 2004. The stone had an inscription supposedly written by Arthur J. Finkelstein. However, construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money, security, and design. The last major issues were resolved on April 26, 2006, when a deal was made between developer Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on June 23, 2006. Soon after, explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the building's foundation, onto which of concrete was poured by November 2007. In a December 18, 2006, ceremony held in nearby Battery Park City, members of the public were invited to sign the first steel beam installed onto the building's base. It was welded onto the building's base on December 19, 2006. Foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward, so the tower's footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year. In January 2008, two cranes were moved onto the site. Construction of the tower's concrete core, which began after the cranes arrived, reached street level by May 17. However, construction of the base was not finished until two years later, after which construction of the office floors began, and the first glass windows were subsequently installed; during 2010, floors were constructed at a rate of about one per week. An advanced \\"cocoon\\" scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling, and was the first such safety system installed on a steel structure in the city. The tower reached 52 floors and was over tall by December 2010. The tower's steel frame was halfway complete by then, but grew to 82 floors by the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, at which time its concrete flooring had reached 72 floors and the glass cladding had reached 56 floors. In 2009, the Port Authority changed the official name of the building from \\"Freedom Tower\\" to \\"One World Trade Center\\", stating that this name was the \\"easiest for people to identify with.\\" The change came after board members of the Port Authority voted to sign a 21-year lease deal with Vantone Industrial Co., a Chinese real estate company, which would become the building's first commercial tenant to sign a lease. Vantone plans to create the China Center, a trade and cultural facility, covering 191,000 square feet on floors 64 through 69. Detailed floor plans of the tower were posted on New York City's Department of Finance website in May 2011. This resulted in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area, who warned that the plans could potentially be used for a future terrorist attack. While under construction, the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions. On the weekend of July 4, 2011, it was lit up with the colors of the U.S. flag to commemorate Independence Day, and it was lit up with the same colors on September 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. On October 27 of that same year, it was illuminated with pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On December 11, the Port Authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season. On February 24, 2012, the building was lit up with red in honor of Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan, who became a cardinal on February 18. On June 14, 2012, it was illuminated with red, white, and blue to honor Flag Day. In August, it was illuminated with red in honor of the Armed Forces. On September 8, 2012, it was once again illuminated with red, white, and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. On June 24, 2013, the building was again illuminated with red, white, and blue to celebrate the Fourth of July. The tower's loading dock, however, was not due to be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building, so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars. The temporary PATH station was not to be removed until its official replacement, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, was completed, blocking access to the planned loading area. By March 2012, One World Trade Center's steel structure had reached 93 floors, growing to 94 floors and by the end of the month. However, because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements, the 94th floor was numbered \\"floor 100\\", because the extra space was occupied by the high-ceilinged 91st floor, which was used for mechanical purposes. The still-incomplete tower became New York City's tallest building by roof height in April 2012, passing the roof height of the Empire State Building. President Barack Obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote, on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower, the sentence \\"We remember, we rebuild, we come back stronger!\\" That same month, with the tower's structure nearing completion, the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building, seeking to attract visitors and tenants. One World Trade Center's steel structure topped out at the nominal 104th floor, with a total height of , in August 2012. The tower's spire was then shipped from Quebec to New York in November 2012, and the first section of the spire was hoisted to the top of the tower on December 12, 2012, and was installed on January 15, 2013. By March 2013, two sections of the spire had been installed. The spire's completion was scheduled for April 29, 2013, but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces. On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing the tower to its full height of , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world at the time. In subsequent months, the exterior elevator shaft was removed; the podium glass, interior decorations, and other finishings were being installed; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed. A report in September 2013 revealed that, at the time of the report, the World Trade Center Association (WTCA) was negotiating with regard to the \\"World Trade Center\\" name, as the WTCA had purchased the rights to the name in 1986. The WTCA sought $500,000 worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of \\"World Trade Center\\" in the tower's name and associated souvenirs. On November 12, 2013, the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) made the controversial announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest building in the United States at , declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building's architecture. By the same reasoning, the building was also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.

The New York Times noted that the area around the World Trade Center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms, residences, and luxury shops, coincident with the building of the new tower. The building opened on November 3, 2014, and Cond√© Nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors. Cond√© Nast occupied floors 20 to 44, having completed its move in early 2015. It was expected that the company would attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40% of unleased space in the tower, as Cond√© Nast had revitalized Times Square after moving there in 1999. Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day. At the time, future tenants included Kids Creative, Legends Hospitality, the BMB Group, Servcorp, and GQ. Disabled suspended working platform used for maintenance activities on southern exposure On November 12, 2014, the supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked. The cables were manufactured by Tractel, and they were used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the building's exterior. At the time, the platform was holding a two-man, SEIU-affiliated window washing team. The slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower. The workers were rescued by over 100 FDNY firefighters, who used a diamond saw to cut through the glass. After the incident, the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia, and were taken to the hospital. =Estimated cost and funding= An estimate in February 2007 placed the initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 per square foot ($12,380 per square meter). However, the tower's total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building in the world at the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1 billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250 million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1 billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56 percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction.\\"Critics blast Port Authority for changing position on how toll hike money will be spent\\".

Many of Daniel Libeskind's original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty. One World Trade Center is considered the first major building whose construction is based upon a three-dimensional Building Information Model. The building occupies a square, with an area of , nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers.

The curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by Benson Industries in Portland, Oregon, using glass made in Minnesota by Viracon. From the 20th floor upwards, the square edges of the tower's cubic base are chamfered back, shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles, or an elongated square antiprism.

David Childs of SOM, the architect of One World Trade Center, said the following regarding the tower's design:Interview with David Childs (cont'd). Retrieved October 12, 2007 Layout Entrance to the tower Just south of the new One World Trade Center is the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, which is located where the original Twin Towers stood. Immediately to the east is World Trade Center Transportation Hub and the new Two World Trade Center site. To the north is 7 World Trade Center, and to the west is Brookfield Place. One World Trade Center's top floor is officially designated as floor 104, despite the fact that the tower only contains 94 actual stories. The building has 86 usable above-ground floors, of which 78 are intended for office purposes (approximately ). The base consists of floors 1‚Äì19, including a 65-foot-high (20 m) public lobby, featuring the 90-foot mural ONE: Union of the Senses by American artist Jos√© Parl√°. The office floors begin at floor 20, and go up to floor 63. There is a sky lobby on floor 64; office floors resume on floor 65, and stop at floor 90. Floors 91‚Äì99 and 103‚Äì104 are mechanical floors. One World Observatory The tower has a three-story observation deck, located on floors 100‚Äì102, in addition to existing broadcast and antenna facilities. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors to the observation deck and tenants have their own separate entrances; one entrance is on the West Street side of the building, and the other is from within the shopping mall, descending down to a below-ground security screening area. On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, but there is a food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor. To show visitors the city, and give them information and stories about New York, an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors. The admission fee is $32 per person, but admission discounts are available for children and seniors, and the deck is free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims. When it opened, the deck was expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year. Tickets went on sale starting on April 8. However, the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck. It officially opened on May 28, 2015, one day ahead of schedule. There are three eating venues at the top of the building: a caf√© (called One Caf√©), a bar and \\"small plates\\" grill (One Mix), and a fine dining restaurant (One Dining). Some have criticized the food prices; the need of a full observatory ticket purchase to enter; and their reputations compared to Windows on the World, the top-floor restaurant in the original One World Trade Center. The tenants have access to below-ground parking, storage, and shopping; access to PATH, New York City Subway trains, and the World Financial Center is also provided at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, Fulton Street/Fulton Center, Chambers Street, and Cortlandt Street stations. The building allows direct access to West Street, Vesey Street, and Fulton Street at ground level. The building has an approximate underground footprint of , of which is retail space. A plan to build a restaurant near the top of the tower, similar to the original One World Trade Center's Windows on the World, was abandoned as logistically impractical. The tower's window-washing tracks are located on a 16-square-foot area, which is designated as floor 110 as a symbolic reference to the 110 floors of the original tower.

Height comparison of major skyscrapers in New York City, with One World Trade Center shown at far left. The North Tower of WTC was 1,727 ft (526.3 m) The tall base corners were originally designed to gently slope upward, and have prismatic glass. The corners were later squared. In addition, the base's walls are now covered in \\"hundreds of pairs of 13-foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight-inch-wide stainless-steel slats.\\" The spire was originally to be enclosed with a protective radome, described as a \\"sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels\\". However, the radome-enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna. Douglas Durst, the chairman of the Durst Organization, stated that the design change would save $20 million. However, the tower's architect, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, strongly criticized the change. David Childs, the lead designer, said, \\"Eliminating this integral part of the building's design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate ... We stand ready to work with the Port on an alternate design.\\" After joining the project in 2010, the Durst Organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs, but the proposal was rejected by the Port Authority's then-executive director, Christopher O. Ward. Ward was replaced by Patrick Foye in September 2011.Transportation Nation: \\"Patrick Foye Named New Executive Director of NY- NJ Port Authority\\" By Jim O'Grady . October 19, 2012. Foye changed the Port Authority's position, and the radome was removed from the plans. In 2012, Douglas Durst gave a statement regarding the final decision: \\"(the antenna) is going to be mounted on the building over the summer. There's no way to do anything at this point.\\" The large triangular plaza on the west side of One World Trade Center, facing the Hudson River, was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street. However, the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design. The terrace can be accessed through a staircase on Vesey Street. The terrace is paved in granite, and has 12 sweetgum trees, in addition to a block-long planter/bench. Durst also removed a skylight from the plaza's plans; the skylight was designed to allow natural light to enter the below-ground observation deck lobby. The plaza is higher than the adjacent sidewalk. The Port Authority formally approved all these revisions, and the revisions were first reported by the New York Post. Patrick Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority, said that he thought that the changes were \\"few and minor\\" in a telephone interview. A contract negotiated between the Port Authority and the Durst Organization states that the Durst Organization will receive a $15 million fee and a percentage of \\"base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project.\\" The specifics of the signed contract give Durst 75 percent of the savings, up to $24 million, with further returns going down to 50 percent, 25 percent and 15 percent as the savings increase. =Height= When viewed from street level in proximity to the tower, One World Trade Center appears to ascend to a pyramid point. The top floor of One World Trade Center is above ground level, along with a parapet; this is identical to the roof height of the original One World Trade Center. The tower's spire brings it to a pinnacle height of , a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776, when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. When the spire is included in the building's height, as stated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), One World Trade Center surpasses the height of Taipei 101 (), is the world's tallest all-office building, and the sixth-tallest skyscraper in the world, behind the Burj Khalifa, Abraj Al Bait, Shanghai Tower, Ping An Finance Centre and Lotte World Tower. One World Trade Center is the second-tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere, as the CN Tower in Toronto exceeds One World Trade Center's pinnacle height by approximately . The Chicago Spire, with a planned height of , was expected to exceed the height of One World Trade Center, but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in 2009. Spire atop One World Trade Center After design changes for One World Trade Center's spire were revealed in May 2012, there were questions as to whether the -tall structure would still qualify as a spire, and thus be included in the building's height. Since the tower's spire is not enclosed in a radome as originally planned, it could be classified as a simple antenna, which is not included in a building's height, according to the CTBUH. Without the antenna, One World Trade Center would be tall, making it the fourth-tallest building in the United States, behind the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel & Tower, both located in Chicago, and 432 Park Avenue in New York. The building is currently the tallest in New York City with the antenna; however, without the antenna, it was surpassed in 2015 by 432 Park Avenue, which topped out at high. One World Trade Center's developers have disputed the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign, with Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman reiterating that \\"One World Trade Center will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.\\" In 2012, the CTBUH announced that it would wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire would count towards the building's height. On November 12, 2013, the CTBUH announced that One World Trade Center's spire would count as part of the building's recognized height, giving it a final height of 1,776 feet, and making it the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. Sustainability Like other buildings in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80 percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8 megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity.\\"Fuel cells: a clean energy alternative at new World Trade Center\\". cleantechnica.com. December 18, 2011. Retrieved January 24, 2012. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off- site hydroelectric and wind power.\\"Green Facts About 1 WTC\\" . ThomasNet. January 3, 2012. Retrieved January 21, 2012 The windows are made of an ultra- clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world. Security features One World Trade Center and 7 World Trade Center at night Along with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base, a number of other safety features were included in the building's design, so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack. Like 7 World Trade Center, the building has thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells, elevator shafts, risers, and sprinkler systems. There are also extra-wide, pressurized stairwells, along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters, and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system. In comparison, the original Twin Towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions, protected only by lightweight drywall panels. The building is no longer away from West Street, as the Twin Towers were; at its closest point, West Street is away. The Port Authority has stated: \\"Its structure is designed around a strong, redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected by a combination of welding and bolting. Paired with a concrete-core shear wall, the moment frame lends substantial rigidity and redundancy to the overall building structure while providing column-free interior spans for maximum flexibility.\\" In addition to safety design, new security measures were implemented. All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before they enter the site through the underground road. Four hundred closed- circuit surveillance cameras will be placed in and around the site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site. Before the World Trade Center site was fully completed, the plaza was not completely opened to the public, as the original World Trade Center plaza was. The initial stage of the opening process began on Thursday, May 15, 2014, when the \\"Interim Operating Period\\" of the National September 11 Memorial ended. During this period, all visitors were required to undergo airport style security screening, as part of the \\"Interim Operating Period\\", which was expected to end on December 31, 2013. However, screening did not fully end until the official dedication and opening of the museum on May 21, 2014, after which visitors were allowed to use the plaza without needing passes. =Incidents= In March 2014, the tower was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey resident Justin Casquejo, who entered the site through a hole in a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower's 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site. Casquejo was sentenced to 23 days of community service as a result. Controversies The social center of the previous One World Trade Center included a restaurant on the 107th floor, called Windows on the World, and The Greatest Bar on Earth; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a gathering spot for people who worked in the towers. This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called \\"Windows on the World Wine School\\", run by wine personality Kevin Zraly. Despite numerous assurances that these attractions would be rebuilt, the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild them, which has outraged some observers. The fortified base of the tower has also been a source of controversy. Some critics, including Deroy Murdock of the National Review, have said that it is alienating and dull, and reflects a sense of fear rather than freedom, leading them to dub the building \\"the Fear Tower\\". Nicolai Ouroussoff, the architecture critic for The New York Times, calls the tower base a \\"grotesque attempt to disguise its underlying paranoia\\". =Owners and tenants= Seen at sunset; the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is in the background One World Trade Center is principally owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Around 5 percent equity of the building was sold to the Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100 million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55 percent of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8 percent by November 2014.

Silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001, and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site's redevelopment process. Before construction of the new tower began, Silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower. The terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001, for which Silverstein paid $14 million, gave Silverstein, as leaseholder, the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed. After the September 11 attacks, there were a series of disputes between Silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers; this resulted in the construction of One World Trade Center being delayed. After a trial resulted, a verdict was given on April 29, 2004. The verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the \\"one occurrence\\" interpretation, so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies. Three insurers were added to the second trial group. At that time, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer, Swiss Reinsurance, but it did so several days later on May 3, 2004, finding that this company was also subject to the \\"one occurrence\\" interpretation. Silverstein appealed the Swiss Reinsurance decision, but the appeal failed on October 19, 2006. The second trial resulted in a verdict on December 6, 2004. The jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the \\"two occurrences\\" interpretation, referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the September 11 attacks. They were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies ($2.2 billion). The highest potential payout was $4.577 billion, for buildings 1, 2, 4, and 5. In March 2007, Silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted what he describes as the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern. Key project coordinators David Childs, one of Silverstein's favorite architects, joined the project after Silverstein urged him to do so. He developed a design proposal for One World Trade Center, initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind. In May 2005, Childs revised the design to address security concerns. He is the architect of the tower, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development.Profile of David Childs . America Rebuilds. 2006. Retrieved January 15, 2012.

M. Burton (Andrew Mizell Burton), great-grandfather of singer Amy Grant. See p. 32, where Grant testifies to the influence of A.M. Burton and especially his wife Lillie Burton. Burton was a regional manager for the Western & Southern Life Insurance Company, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, when it decided to discontinue operating in Tennessee. Burton was going to be discharged, but according to company lore, was told by his superior, \\"If you're the man that I think that you are, you'll start your own company,\\" and he did so. For many years, the firm sold a mixture of \\"industrial life insurance\\" policies, with small face amounts and costing low premiums, to working-class individuals and small farmers and \\"ordinary life\\" policies for middle class and affluent persons. Much of this business was sold on the \\"debit\\" or \\"home service\\" plan, where usually the agent who sold the policy initially personally called on the client to collect the premiums when they became due. In 1957 the company occupied its new home office, the 31-story Life & Casualty Tower, located at 4th Avenue North and Church Street in downtown Nashville; the building was briefly the tallest one in the Southeast. The company was also known for its ownership of radio and television stations WLAC, properties it held until the 1970s. In the mid-1960s, the company was sold to the American General Insurance Company of Texas, but its operations remained largely unchanged until the early 1980s. In 1968 the former Knights Life Insurance company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (then a part of American General Insurance) had its operations transferred from Pittsburgh to Nashville. When American General acquired longtime Nashville rival National Life and Accident Insurance Company in a hostile takeover it implemented plans to merge the two companies. By the end of the 1980s this had been largely accomplished, and the L&C; Tower, still a Nashville landmark but no longer its tallest building, was sold to outside interests. The company Burton founded went through a series of mergers and acquisitions which now form American General Life and Accident, now headquartered in the Nashville suburb of Brentwood, Tennessee as part of American International Group (AIG).

Although most of the action is a verbatim performance of Oscar Wilde's 1891 play Salome, which is itself based on a story from the New Testament, there is also a framing narrative which was written by Russell. Plot Wilde (Nickolas Grace) and his lover Lord Alfred Douglas (Douglas Hodge) arrive late on Guy Fawkes Day in 1892 at their friend's brothel, where they are treated to a surprise staging of Wilde's play, public performances of which have just been banned in England by the Lord Chamberlain's office. In the play, all the roles are played by prostitutes or their clients, and each actor (except Grace) plays two roles, one in the brothel and the other in the play. King Herod (Stratford Johns) begs his young stepdaughter Salome (Imogen Millais- Scott) to dance for him, promising to give her anything she desires, much to the irritation of her mother, Herodias (Glenda Jackson). Salome ignores him, choosing instead to try and seduce John the Baptist, who is Herod's prisoner. John responds by loudly condemning both Herod and Salome in the name of God. A spurned and vengeful Salome then agrees to dance for Herod ‚Äî on the condition that she be given anything she asks for. Herod agrees, but it is only after the dance is over that Salome asks for the head of John the Baptist on a platter. Herod is appalled, tries to dissuade her, but finally gives in to her request. The scenes from the play are interwoven with images of Wilde's exploits at the brothel. At the end Wilde is arrested.

Imogen Millais-Scott went blind three weeks before filming after contracting glandular fever but Russell insisted on still using her. It has been suggested that she was too weak to perform the dance sequence and a body double was used, but in any case a male of similar build performs Salome's dance and, at one point, flashes male genitals. \\"It's a tale that can be interpreted in many ways,\\" said Russell. \\"Years ago, I wrote it into a script titled Space Gospel, which was the New Testament in science-fiction. It didn't work out. I also thought of using the opera with the dance of the seven veils for my segment in Aria... but they wanted $3,000 a minute for the music.\\"Outrageous movie director's wild about Oscar: Toronto Star 18 May 1988: D1. For dramatic effect, Russell compressed the actual arrest of Wilde in 1895 and the first performance of his play in Paris in 1896. Russell said, \\"Although the play was never produced in London during his lifetime - even though he had Sarah Bernhardt actually in rehearsals for it before it was banned - I just made up the conceit of showing it in the brothel to give a flavor of what his life at the time was like, and at the same time give a hint of the homosexual relationship with Bosie that really was his downfall. All of this is interwoven with the play, which is about love and corruption and deceit anyway.\\" Russell later claimed he made the film on a bet that he could not make a movie under $1 million. The film was made for $1.3 million with filming completed in three and a half weeks. Shortly after filming Russell said \\"The critics haven't worn me down, so maybe I'm trying to wear them down. I'm also trying to reach a wider - and younger - audience, and make films that are more visually stimulating. It isn't easy. I've never made a film I was totally happy with. That's what keeps me going: the next one must be better.\\" Reception This film met with modest critical praise. The review in The New York Times called it \\"a perfumed, comic stunt,\\" but noted that \\"Mr. Russell forces one to attend to (and to discover the odd glory in) the Wilde language, which, on the printed page, works faster than valium.\\"Vincent Canby, \\"Salome's Last Dance: Review / Film; Salome and Decadence, Via Wilde via Russell\\".

Its design and use followed a comparable path to those taken by the German Luftwaffe with the Junkers Ju 88 and the British Royal Air Force with the De Havilland Mosquito. The Soviets realized the need for a night fighter after the first night bombing of Moscow during Operation Barbarossa. The Petlyakov Pe-2 was selected for modification as the most suitable aircraft available. It was initially used for daylight ground attack missions during the Battle of Moscow, but this proved to be costly since the aircraft was unarmored. Armor and additional guns were retrofitted to the existing aircraft to make it more effective, but the evacuation of the sole factory building the Pe-3 in October 1941 limited the number of aircraft available and many units of the Soviet Air Forces flying the Pe-3 were either disbanded or converted to other aircraft. Although production was stopped and restarted several times, the aircraft remained in service throughout World War II. Most of the later production runs were given to reconnaissance units. Development A crash-development program began after the July 1941 German night bombing of Moscow to field a night fighter with heavy armament and long endurance. Only an aircraft currently in production could be used to satisfy the extremely tight deadline and the Pe-2 was selected for modification by the State Commissariat for Defence (‚ÄîNKO) as the fastest twin-engined aircraft in service. The order only authorized four days to modify the aircraft's fuel, armament and radio systems, but this deadline was met when the modified aircraft made its first flight on 7 August and it passed its manufacturer's trials the following day.Smith, p. 39 Three additional fuel tanks, with a capacity of were fitted in the prototype, one in the fuselage bomb bay and the other two replaced the ventral gunner's position. The nose armament was reinforced with an additional Berezin UBK machine gun with 150 rounds and a fixed ShKAS machine gun with 250 rounds was added in the tail cone. Removal of two of the fuselage bomb racks reduced the maximum bomb load to , one bomb on each of the fuselage racks and one in each of the engine nacelles. The electric bomb release system was removed and the bombs had to be dropped using the mechanical system, initially designed as the emergency system. The dive brakes under the wings were also removed. The BSBbis radio was exchanged for the RSI-4 model commonly used in single-seat fighters and the radio direction finder was also removed to save weight. The prototype weighed empty and it had a normal take-off weight of , slightly heavier than the version of the Pe-2 then in production. During testing it demonstrated a maximum speed of at , a service ceiling of and a maximum range of . This was considered adequate and Factory () Nr. 39 in Moscow was ordered on 14 August to build five pre- production aircraft for delivery by 25 August. This process proved difficult because drawings had not been made for many of the new parts and they had to be fitted by hand, slowing the production rate.Gordon, pp. 381‚Äì83 Slightly more extensive testing of a pre-production aircraft was done by the Air Force Scientific Test Institute (‚ÄîNII VVS) between 29 August and 7 September. Although they confirmed the initial performance figures, the tests revealed other problems. The lower nose Plexiglas windows cracked when the lower UBK machine gun was fired, a problem initially cured by replacing some of the glazing with a duralumin skin, but this too proved to be too weak, and it was itself later replaced by a steel panel. Pre-production testing also revealed that the casings and links from the large-caliber weapons damaged the skin of the wings and sometimes entered the radiator intakes, where they could cause extensive damage. Revising the shape of the ejector chutes did not help and the casings had to be collected in the nose. Pre-production testing also identified several other specific weaknesses that had to be corrected on the production line. The Pe-3's offensive firepower was too weak and a ShVAK cannon was added. The firepower of the dorsal 7.62mm ShKAS machine gun was considered inadequate, and on the production line, was replaced by a 12.7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun. To protect the crew, the production line added frontal armor and extended existing armor to the rear to protect the navigator. The production line also replaced the RSI-4 radio with model that had greater range and added a camera for the Pe-3's reconnaissance role. Although most of the initial aircraft were delivered without these adaptations, they were modified in the field by factory teams.Gordon, pp. 383‚Äì84 The first Pe-3s were issued to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Regiment in the Moscow Military District and the Regiment's experiences with the aircraft revealed other problems. Firing the guns at night dazzled the pilot and destroyed his night vision and the glare from searchlights through the glazing on the lower nose also blinded the pilot. Crews complained bitterly that the lack of frontal armor made them vulnerable to defensive fire from German bombers. Flash hiders installed on the guns and curtains covering the windows cured the first problems, but the lack of armor could not be rectified immediately. Many aircraft were also fitted with launchers for four to six RS-82 and RS-132 rockets for ground-attack missions. Another common addition was a launcher for DAG-10 aerial grenades mounted in the tail.Smith, pp. 41‚Äì44 The Petlyakov design bureau addressed these concerns in September and they were tested in the Pe-3bisbis was a suffix used by the Soviets to mark a major upgrade of an aircraft or weapon prototype between September and October. The armament was upgraded with 250 rounds provided for each of the UBK machine guns, a 20 mm ShVAK cannon with 250 rounds was mounted in the nose and a 12.7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun with 180 rounds in boxes replaced the 7.62 mm ShKAS in the dorsal position. Frontal armor was installed and the navigator's seat armor was thickened with a total weight of . Automatic leading edge slats were fitted and the nitrogen fuel tank pressurization system was replaced by one that used inert gases from the engine exhaust. The crash pylon was moved forward and the cockpit canopy shortened.Gordon, p. 384 Many of these changes were made to aircraft before Pe-3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat-use revealed several additional problems that had to be addressed in a second Pe-3bis prototype, which began its State acceptance tests in May 1942.Smith, p. 44 Reloading the nose guns proved to be time-consuming, taking up to 45 minutes, and the night-firing of the port-side UBK continued to blind the pilot. These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition. The starboard gun was given 230 rounds and the port gun had 265 rounds. This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7 fuel tank by , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns. The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected, making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable. These were reinforced with steel sheets to minimize the damage inflicted by the large- caliber cases. The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire, but lack of aerodynamic balance prevented the gunner/navigator to use its full range. Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40‚Äì50¬∞ from the centerline. A twin-petal compensator proved mostly ineffective. The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space. The ammunition box of the UBT was too small, only 30 rounds, and took about a minute to reload. The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200-round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems. An anti-icing system was added for the propellers and the pilot's windscreen. The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew's armor was increased to a total weight of . These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened, moving the wheels forward, which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over.Gordon, pp. 385‚Äì86 =Production= Zavod Nr. 39 built 16 Pe-3s in August, including the prototype, 98 in September and 82 in October before the factory was evacuated to Irkutsk late in October. Production was restarted in April 1942 with a total of 132 built during the year. All were Pe-3bis models except for eleven Pe-3s that had not been completed before the evacuation. Thirteen were built in 1943 before production was canceled in favor of Ilyushin Il-4 bombers. A final production batch of 19 was built at Zavod Nr. 22 in early 1944, but these were more lightly armed than earlier versions, with only a single ShVAK cannon in the wing center section and one UBK in the nose. The bomb racks in the engine nacelles were eliminated entirely, as was the fixed ShKAS machine gun in the tail. Two DAG-10 grenade launchers were fitted in the rear fuselage, each with ten grenades.Gordon, p. 387 Operational history The first Pe-3s were issued to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment in August 1941 and it was initially committed to the ground attack and escort roles after retraining through September. It was redesignated as the 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment on 25 September and assigned to the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps of the PVO defending Moscow. A few days later six Pe-3s escorted C-47s carrying a British military delegation flying from Vologda to Moscow and successfully defended against several German attacks on the transports. Pe-3s strafed German troop columns as they approached Moscow during Operation Typhoon. On 24 October the 95th and 208th Fighter Aviation Regiments, with a total of twenty-seven Pe-3s between them, attacked the German airfield at Kalinin, claiming thirty German aircraft destroyed for the loss of five Soviet aircraft and pilots, including the commander of the 208th Regiment, Major S. Kibirinym. The 9th, 40th, 54th and 511th Bomber Aviation Regiments also received Pe-3s during September and performed similar missions. Approximately 50 aircraft were lost during the Pe-3's first three months of combat, about 25% of the aircraft produced thus far. This was a very high loss rate and a number of units began to conduct less risky reconnaissance missions to minimize casualties. Pe-3s were issued to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiments in October as well. With production terminated in October due to the evacuation of the factory, the number of available Pe-3s could not sustain as many units and many began to convert to other aircraft or roles. The 40th Fast Bomber Aviation Regiment was re-designated as the 40th Separate Long-range Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment on 15 December and mustered five Pe-3s on 1 May 1942 and eleven Pe-3s on 1 January 1943. The 9th Bomber Aviation Regiment was directly assigned to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force at the end of November 1941 and received the additional task of leading groups of fighters and attack aircraft to their targets because their pilots could not navigate on their own. Over 2000 aircraft were led to their targets in this manner before the regiment was converted to other roles. The 54th Bomber Aviation Regiment appears to have been disbanded on or after 20 May 1942. The 208th Short-Range Bomber Regiment lost ten aircraft before it transferred its surviving pilots and aircraft to the 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment in mid-January 1942 and reformed on the Ilyushin Il-2. On 5 February 1942 the 511th Bomber Aviation Regiment was based at Tula and lost three of its eight Pe-3s on strength to a German air raid. It was disbanded in late March 1942 for lack of aircraft. The 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment was transferred on 1 March 1942 to the Air Force of the Northern Fleet where it performed convoy escort, ground attack and reconnaissance missions in support of the Fleet. It operated Pe-3s as late as the end of 1942 when some of its crews, which had just picked up new aircraft, were diverted to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad, although most of the 1942 production aircraft were given to the 2nd, 4th, and 40th Separate Long- Range Reconnaissance Regiments. A single Pe-3 was captured by the Finns when it had to make a forced landing in marshy ground near Lake Inari on 28 November 1942. It was relatively undamaged and was recovered, repaired and placed into service as 'PE-301'. It served with PLeLv 48 and was converted into a photo-reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing raid on the airfield at Lappeenranta on 2 July 1944. By then, it had flown over 222 hours in Finnish service.Smith, pp. 97‚Äì98 The Gneiss-2 airborne radar was evaluated in the Pe-3 beginning in July 1942 and it was sent to both Moscow and Stalingrad for combat trials in late 1942. Another round of trials was conducted by aircraft of the 2nd Guards Fighter Corps of the PVO in Leningrad between February and May 1943 and it was approved for service the next month.

As a newspaper columnist, he was a vocal critic of segregation policies in baseball and American football. Treat also edited a major reference work on football, first published in 1952.  Journalism  Treat began his newspaper career as sports editor of the Washington Daily News in 1943 and moved to the Chicago American in 1947. His first published article was a piece for Esquire about boxer Wesley Ramey. He also worked at the Washington Post, Baltimore News-American, The News-Times, and Republican- American. Treat was an advocate for racial integration in American sports. He helped Jackie Robinson get a tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, and reportedly was involved in the decision to admit Robinson into the National League. In 1946, he helped to start an integrated baseball academy for young men. In 1947, he was let go from his position at the Washington Daily News following a number of columns in which he criticized the Umpires' Association for refusing to referee games featuring racially integrated teams. He also spoke against segregation in amateur baseball and boxing in Washington, DC. Another of Treat's 1947 columns concerned integration efforts at the Chicago Cubs. In 1948, noting that the Chicago White Sox only had one quality infielder, he suggested that the team place Art Wilson, a shortstop for the Birmingham Black Barons, on their roster. In 1944, in the midst of World War II and its associated shortages, Treat wrote a widely circulated satirical editorial in which he criticized various organizations, including Brown University and Columbia University, for wasting paper by sending out throwaway press releases to newspaper offices. In 1949, boxer Steve Mamakos sued Treat for libel after Treat published an article titled \\"Eddie Eagan No. 1 Butcher in Mental Murder of Steve Mamakos\\".  Football encyclopedia  alt= In the early 1950s, Treat launched an effort to document the history of American football. That work culminated in the 1952 publication of The Official Encyclopedia of the National Football League. The book represented the first attempt to document the score of every game in the league's history and every player who had appeared in a game. A 1952 review of the first edition in the Chicago Tribune called it a \\"touchdown\\". Frank Litsky, reviewing the sixth edition in the New York Times in 1969, described it as \\"monumental\\" and a \\"labor of love\\". A 1969 review of the seventh edition called it \\"an essential volume for the serious football buff, or already-knowledgable fan, or for the writer\\". Treat oversaw the publication of six revised editions before his death in 1969. Thereafter, his daughter-in-law Suzanne Treat became the book's editor, publishing nine more editions between 1970 and 1979.  Other works  In collaboration with Page Cooper, Treat wrote Man o' War, a biography of the racehorse Man o' War, which was published in 1950. The Washington Post called it \\"first-rate\\". Among Treat's other books were a pulp novel called Joy Ride and a biography of his close friend Bernard J. Sheil entitled Bishop Sheil and the CYO, about Sheil's involvement with the Catholic Youth Organization in Chicago. A 1951 review of Bishop Sheil observed that \\"Treat, obviously, is a sincere admirer of the bishop\\". Treat wrote three books for children: Walter Johnson, King of the Pitchers (1948), Duke of the Bruins (1950), and Boy Jockey (1953). Treat's final book, published after his death, was a novel called The Endless Road. It tells the story of a Chicago newspaperman struggling with alcoholism. The Guardian called it \\"a heartfelt boost for Alcoholics Anonymous\\". The book was banned under Ireland's Censorship of Publications Act 1946 for being \\"indecent or obscene\\".  Personal life  Treat married his first wife, Eleanor, in June 1935. She filed for divorce in May 1949, alleging desertion. Treat and his second wife Gerda Dahl Treat, an actor and salesperson, had two sons, John Treat and Peter Treat. Treat died of lung cancer in Danbury, Connecticut.

It broadcasts on 1000 kHz which is simulcast on FM 97.9 MHz with full-time service. WIOO signed on the air in 1965. FM service was added in the summer of 2009. The call letters stand for the station's former long-time slogan, \\"W-100,\\" referring to its position on the AM dial. WIOO played contemporary music for most of its history. During the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s, it was a successful Top 40 station which, despite being a daytimer, competed with Harrisburg stations WKBO and WFEC for the teenage audience.http://www.reelradio.com/rjh/index.html For the past 21 years, WIOO has carried a \\"country gold\\" format, playing country music from approximately 5‚Äì50 years ago. It is affiliated with Westwood One, and with Motor Racing Network, and Performance Racing Network for extensive NASCAR coverage. The station operated at full power from local sunrise to local sunset, and at reduced power (approximately 30 watts) from local sunset until 45 minutes later, when it signed off to protect the clear channel of WMVP in Chicago from skywave interference. This will change once the power upgrade is complete (see below). The station will still be required to sign off after sunset. 97.9 for Carlisle simulcasts all of the AM programming, providing continuous service. WIOO also currently simulcasts the majority of its programming onto WEEO, a 460 watt AM station on 1480 kHz licensed to Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. WEEO is simulcast on FM 93.9 MHz in stereo. This station can be heard in Shippensburg, Chambersburg, Newville and many other areas throughout south central Pennsylvania. WIOO has a long- standing history of morning personalities dating back to the mid-1960s. They include Bob Hamilton, Dick Raymond, R.J. Harris, Jim (J.J) Jefferson and Marissa Osborne, Ben Barber, Jack Wagner, Scott Donato, Kirk Wise (Wise Guy), Dave Eddy, Larry Flood, and currently on the air veteran broadcaster Michael Andrews who doubles as news director. Currently, afternoon drive is handled by air personality and program director Ray Thomas. Ray has been a major force in Carlisle radio for over a quarter of a century. Robin Quivers, now of The Howard Stern Show, received her first radio job on WIOO in late 1979. Quivers beat out a field of three applicants from the Broadcast Institute of Maryland (BIM) to get the news anchor position at WIOO. In addition to its country gold programming, the WIOO stations air local news in Cumberland County, provide the noonday Tradio show for listener call ins each day as part of its one-hour news and information block, and carry live sports including locally produced Cumberland Valley Eagles football on the Carlisle frequencies and Shippensburg Greyhounds football on 1480 and 93.9. The station carries major college and NFL football, NASCAR and Baltimore Orioles baseball during respective seasons. WIOO was granted a construction permit by the FCC in 2015. The station's day power will increase to 15,000 watts, and it will gain critical hours power of 2,700 watts. The station's critical hour power is subject to local sunset of WMVP Chicago, Illinois, on the same frequency.http://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/143974/radio-disney-sells-wrdz-a-chicago-to-polnet All Access News - July 30, 2015 Translator WIOO programming is broadcast on the following translator: References External links *Country Gold 1000 - official website Country radio stations in the United States IOO Radio stations established in 1965 1965 establishments in Pennsylvania IOO ","title":"WIOO"},{"id":"5003083","text":"The Anatolian beylik of Dulkadir (Modern Turkish: Dulkadiroƒüullarƒ± Beyliƒüi), was one of the frontier principalities established by the Turkoman clans Bayat, Afshar and Begdili after the decline of Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm.

As a buffer state For a while, the Beylik of Dulkadiroƒüullarƒ± had an influence extending from Kƒ±r≈üehir to Mosul, but with the rise of the Ottomans, they became a buffer state between the Ottomans and the Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo) of Egypt. They became part of the Ottoman Empire in early 16th century. Until the mid-19th century, the region centered on the town of Elbistan in Kahramanmara≈ü Province of Turkey was often referred to as Dulkadiroƒüullarƒ± (or Zulkadriyye ) State in Ottoman documents. The Dulkadir dynasty also gave many brides to the Ottoman dynasty. Emine Hatun, the daughter of Nasreddin Mehmed Bey, the fifth ruler of Dulkadiroƒüullarƒ± State, was Mehmed I's third consort, and thus the mother of Ottoman Sultan Murad II. Their marriage served as an alliance between the Ottomans and this buffer state. Their son Murad II is the ancestor of all succeeding Sultans.

The album reached # 5 on the U.S. country albums chart, and contained the title tracks to the previous six Parton albums, as well as the tracks \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and \\"Travelin' Man\\". Background and release The album was curiously titled Best of Dolly Parton, although RCA Records had previously released an album titled The Best of Dolly Parton in 1970, which remained in print at the time of this disc's release, as it would for several more years. The album tracks, graphics and catalog numbers were of course different for the two albums (and this release does not have \\"The\\" as part of the title) but still there was some confusion about the albums. This album is occasionally referred to as \\"The Best of Dolly Parton Vol. 2\\", but it never was released under that title, though a third \\"best of\\" collection was released in 1987, Best of Dolly Parton, Vol. 3, suggesting RCA regarded this collection as Volume 2, even if they did not include that designation in the title.Best of Dolly Parton, Vol. 3, despite the title (it was called Best of Dolly on the front cover), was actually the fourth \\"best of\\" collection for Dolly Parton during her tenure at RCA. The real third \\"best of\\" collection was Greatest Hits (1982). The album's original release included an 11 x 20\\" poster of the album cover inside the disc slip. The album's back cover features a large photograph of Parton in a yellow jumpsuit, a rare photograph picture from the period playing up Parton's curves and bust. The original album was a gatefold design with an additional photo of Parton and the printed song lyrics in the inner section (including an additional final verse to \\"Coat of Many Colors\\" that is not included in the recorded version). For unknown reasons, when the album was reissued on CD in the 1990s, the inner gatefold photo was used on the outer cover, rather than the cover photo of the original album release. The order of some of the songs on the reissue was changed as well. Eight of the ten songs were self-penned, major country hits for Parton, the gospel song \\"When I Sing for Him\\", written by Porter Wagoner, was released as a single but did not chart. \\"Lonely Comin' Down\\", also by Wagoner, was never issued as a single (though this same recording was included on two different studio albums: 1972's My Favorite Songwriter: Porter Wagoner, and 1974's Jolene).

History Founded by New Jersey native Fred Loring Seely, the first issue was April 25, 1906, with editor John Temple Graves. They mainly criticized saloons and the convict-lease system. In February 1907, Seely expanded the newspaper by buying out the Atlanta News.Garrett. Vol.II. p. 498. The newspaper was struggling when William Randolph Hearst purchased it in the spring of 1912 (his ninth newspaper property Hearst acquisition .); he transformed it into a yellow press, making it much more successful, if less respected. Journalist James B. Nevin became editor (continuing until his death in 1931) and started the Empty Stocking Fund in 1927. That year the newspaper was awarded the Sutlive Trophy, given by the Georgia Press Association. By the 1930s, it was the third-largest paper in Atlanta with a circulation of 75,000: far behind the Journal (98,000) and the Constitution (91,000).Staff (December 25, 1939). \\"The Press: Big Deal in Georgia\\" . Time. Retrieved January 22, 2016. In 1939, James M. Cox purchased the newspaper at the same time as The Atlanta Journal (now The Atlanta Journal-Constitution). He closed down the Georgian, with its last issue being December 18, 1939. By this time, the Hearst empire had decreased to fewer than twenty newspapers. =Atlanta race riot of 1906= In 1906, The Atlanta Georgian and the Atlanta News, at the behest of gubernatorial candidates Hoke Smith and Clark Howell, began publishing a series of unsubstantiated sensationalized stories claiming that white women were being attacked and raped by black men. This was part of the candidates' attempts to disenfranchise blacks by inciting white fear. It culminated in the Atlanta race riot on September 22, 1906, when the newspapers reported four alleged attacks on white women by black men. After the newspapers came out, a white mob of over 10,000 gathered and started attacking, beating and stabbing any blacks in the streets, as well as going to places frequented by blacks and assaulting them there. This resulted in the murder of 25‚Äì40 African-Americans. None of the culprits were arrested or prosecuted for their crimes.

Wilhelm \\"Willy\\" Burgdorfer (June 27, 1925 ‚Äì November 17, 2014) was an American scientist born and educated in Basel, Switzerland, considered an international leader in the field of medical entomology. He discovered the bacterial pathogen that causes Lyme disease, a spirochete named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. Background He was born on June 27, 1925 in Basel, Switzerland.Memorial page. Daly Leach Memorial Chapel. Burgdorfer earned his Ph.D. in zoology, parasitology, and bacteriology from the University of Basel and the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel.Lucy Bauer: The Great Willy Burgdorfer, 1925‚Äì2014, I am Intramural Blog, NIH Intramural Research Program, https://irp.nih.gov/blog/post/2015/02/the-great-willy-burgdorfer-1925-2014, posted Monday, February 2, 2015, last accessed 21 July 2019. As a research subject for his thesis he chose to study the development of the African relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia duttonii, in its tick vector Ornithodoros moubata, and to evaluate this tick's efficiency in transmitting spirochetes during feeding on animal hosts. During his college years he was a member of a research team investigating outbreaks of Q fever in various parts of Switzerland and became interested in similar research activities carried out at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) in Hamilton, Montana, a U.S. National Institutes of Health research facility. He joined the RML in 1952 as a Research Fellow, and later became a Research Associate in the USPHS's Visiting Scientist Program. In 1957, he became a U.S. citizen and shortly thereafter joined the RML staff as a medical entomologist. Career Burgdorfer in 1978 Burgdorfer's research concerned the interactions between animal and human disease agents and their transmitting arthropod vectors, particularly ticks, fleas and mosquitoes. His research contributions are published in more than 225 papers and books, and cover a wide field of investigations including those on relapsing fevers, plague, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other bacterial and viral diseases. Burgdorfer gained worldwide recognition for his 1982 discovery of a tick-borne spirochete as the long-sought cause of Lyme disease and related disorders in the U.S. and Europe. The agent was named after him ‚Äî Borrelia burgdorferi. Throughout his career, Burgdorfer participated in a number of World Health Organization (WHO) and other health organization-sponsored seminars and congresses. From 1967 to 1972, he served as associate member on the Rickettsial Commission of the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board. For several years (1968‚Äì1971) he was also Co- Project Officer of the PL 480-sponsored Research Project on Rickettsial Zoonoses in Egypt and adjacent areas, and from 1979 to 1986, he directed the WHO-sponsored Reference Center for Rickettsial Diseases at RML in Montana, U.S. Burgdorfer was critical of the path Lyme Disease research had taken over the past 30 years. He believed Borrelia burgdorferi was a persistent infection, and that the current serological testing methodologies needed to be \\"started over from scratch, with people who don't know beforehand the results of their research.\\" Personal life Burgdorfer was married to Gertrude \\"Dale\\" See Burgdorfer until her death in 2005. He later married Lois Rohr; she survived him at the time of his death. He died from complications of Parkinson's disease on November 17, 2014, at a hospital in Hamilton, Montana.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/health/willy-burgdorfer-who-found- bacteria-that-cause-lyme-disease-is-dead-at-89.html Later life Although retiring in 1986, Burgdorfer continued his association with the Rocky Mountain Laboratories' Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis as scientist emeritus. He was also active on the Scientific/Medical Advisory Committee of the Lyme Disease Foundation. In 1999, he delivered the keynote address at the 12th International Conference on Lyme Disease and Other Spirochetal and Tick- Borne Disorders .

It was released in Japan and North America. In the game the player controls a giant robot called a Meganite, humanity's last line of defense against an extraterrestrial race called the Volgara. The player is not in the cockpit of the robot; rather, he or she is on foot, carrying a remote control (the player must switch between the protagonist and the robot to play). As such, Robot Alchemic Drive features many of the same gameplay elements as other Sandlot games. Story As the seventeen-year-old sole inheritor to the Tsukioka family and their bankrupt weapons company, the game introduces the player to a world where all manned space exploration projects have been put on hold indefinitely due to a material called \\"Space Nectar\\" that poisons and kills any organic life in space. Earth is safe because of its atmosphere, but it seems that humanity is doomed to an isolated existence. When machines known as Volgara begin destroying the Earth, the player must pilot the only weapon on Earth capable of standing against the invaders. Along the way, lives will be changed, history will be made, and the origins of the Volgara will be revealed. Gameplay The protagonists that the player may choose between are two males and one female (Naoto Tsukioka, Ryo Tsukioka, or Yui Tsukioka); however, the NPCs usually only refer to the character as \\"Chairman\\" and choice of player character does not affect gameplay. There are 3 different robots to choose from: Vertical Fortress Vavel, Airborne Dominator Laguiole and Gllang the Castlekeep. Vavel has 2 modes, Volcanic and Genesis mode. Laguiole can turn into a plane, and his mode similar to Vavel's is the Demon Sword Desecrator mode, which releases two short, laser like, daggers from the robot's wrists. Gllang can turn into a vehicle/tank being. His special mode is the Warhammer Sanctifier. On his arms, two big blocks of metal alloy are released and become mallets. These special modes only become available after Level 40: Valhalla Dawning. These modes will only last 180 seconds, or 3 minutes. It is possible throughout the game to affect the life of a particular character. For example: Nanao's storyline may be affected by the destruction of certain buildings while on missions. Enemies, for a short number of episodes, are the same. The only difference is the change in color and weapons. They become smarter and more aware of what the main character is doing as the player progresses through the story. You also unlock all of the Volgara in two player versus mode when you beat the game with 2 out of the 3 main protagonists. The game is a homage to the Super Robot anime series of the 70's and 80's. Although much older than most of the game's homages, a remote-controlled robot was first seen in the program Tetsujin 28. Yui's pink and yellow outfit is expressly said in the manual to be a tribute to the heroines of those shows, and Vavel's Lava Stream attack is based on Mazinger Z's Breast Fire attack, even including the biceps-flexing pose usually performed when the weapon was used. Characters The Hero/Heroine: The player-controlled character, a seventeen- year-old junior at the public Senjo High School and the sole heir of the prestigious Tsukioka clan that has gone bankrupt. Tsukioka Industries, a weapons manufacturer, collapsed while funding the construction of the Meganites, which the hero must control to save his/her hometown. There are three characters selectable: Naoto, Yui, and Ryo. Their stories, however, are all very similar. * : A cheerful young man with a strong sense of justice. He is athletically gifted, so is sought out by many of his school's sport teams; however, he prefers to spend his free time alone rather than associating with a particular group. His feelings toward the Trillenium Committee and the Meganite are close to hatred, since he blames them for his father's death and the fall of the Tsukioka clan. As a result, he is torn between protecting his loved ones and controlling the Meganites. * : A cool and reserved young man who excels academically and rides a motorcycle as a hobby. Despite his appearance, he is shockingly agile and the toughest fighter at Senjo School. He tends to be aloof and emotionally distant; while he is popular with girls at school, he shows little interest in them. Though he recognizes that the Tsukioka family's out-of-control business spending is to blame for their collapse, he remains conflicted towards the Meganites and feels stifled as the interim Chairman of the Trillenium Committee. * : A compassionate and attractive young woman adored by the male students at her school. Her outlandish attire comes from her love of robots, particularly the popular super robot anime and live action shows in the 1970s. Unwilling to accept the development costs of the Meganites drove the Tsukioka family to bankruptcy, Yui dismisses them as antiquated junk metal. : A childhood friend of the hero. Her grandmother is killed by a Volgara, which leads to her early animosity towards robots. After her grandmother died, she finds herself living on her own and working to support herself. She means well, but had a tendency to overlook her own boundaries and work herself into a severe fatigue. In a secret path of the story (where Masaru donates enormous funds to CPF), it is revealed that Nanao is Masaru's sister who escaped along with her grandmother. Depending on the player's actions, she can end up being main character's love interest (if Yui is chosen, Nanao remains the player's best friend; however, Nanao will say the same thing to all three of the main characters in the same way, warranting the same reaction from all three due to lack of story changes on part of the creators), live a poor life, or commit suicide at the end of the story. : A brilliant but insane scientist who foresaw the advent of the Volgara and discovered the Nectar Radiance that prevents space travel. He gives the hero the remote control used to operate the Meganites. It was revealed later in the story that he knew everything about the Volgara and the true nature of the Meganites and their Alchemic Drive. : A German scientist who created the Alchemic Drive that generates energy for the Meganites. He offers assistance to the hero during their fights with the Volgara. He is also in charge of upgrading the Meganites. : A radio operator who also assists the player in combat with advice, alongside Dr. Wiltz. She is quite popular among the CPF crew. She lives in a condo near the Foundation headquarters. If her condo is destroyed in the war, she moves to the HQ. : The financial manager for the foundation. She introduces the player to the concept of earning monetary rewards for completing missions. She is also in charge of providing upgradable equipment for the player. She seems to have a heart disease (though the circumstances suggest that she's simply grossly overreacting to any loss of awards during the first mission where they are available). : The heiress to the Bulnose weapons company in France. She was engaged to the hero (or close friends if the player selects Yui), but dropped out of contact with the hero after Tsukioka went bankrupt. She reappears as a member of the Evacuation Guidance Group after having a falling out with her parents. She is also one of the characters that Naoto or Ryo end up dating at the end of the game. Otherwise, she will simply take over the Bulnose Industries. : The heir to Misaki Heavy Industries, a company that thrived in the ruin of Tsukioka, and Ellen's new fiance. He berates the player for failure to protect his company from harm during battle. If his buildings are continually destroyed, his engagement with Ellen will end. Despite his unpleasant attitude, he is actually devoted to the elimination of Volgara threat. If a certain story path is followed, Misaki will donate 100 billion yens to the CPF, which can be used for upgrades etc. : An anchorwoman for BNN News. Her main purpose is providing the player with an evaluation of the aftermath on the battlefield after the completion of a mission. : A field reporter for BNN, she makes her big break in the media by covering the events of the war against the Volgara. Her work can be seen during the game with breaking news reports given during the middle of battle. In the later part of the game she is injured which left her heartbroken. But she regains her self-confidence after she is saved by the main character. Although she survives the war in the canon ending, she can die in the final mission if her news chopper is hit by Asmodeus or by player's Meganite. : A mysterious young man who appears before the player. He is revealed to be Dr. Hourai's son and controls a black Vavel called Valdor. Although he helps the main character in many missions, he is actually ordered by his father to observe Vavel and help it to activate its \\"Genocide Mode\\" (a secret command which will order Vavel to annihilate half of the human race, so the Earth can restore itself) when the time is right. He initially sees the error of his father's ideas and begins to fully support the main character. If the main character is Yui, she and Souya might end up dating at the end of the game. and : Two JSDF tank drivers that appear in many of the missions to support the main character with their Type 90 tank. While Kurosugi is eager to go into battle to defend the civilians, Yamano is afraid that they will be killed by the Volgara and tries to convince the Captain to run away. They survive in the canon ending, but they can be killed in the battle against the Volgara if the player doesn't protect them. : The CEO of the corrupt Otawara Enterprises. He endangers Nanao's employment on a few occasions during the game. Development Robot Alchemic Drive was developed by Sandlot, a company created by former employees of Human Entertainment. The characters of the game were designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto, the character designer of the Cowboy Bebop anime series. Development of Robot Alchemic Drive took approximately 16 to 18 months to complete. Much of the game's use of incredibly large robots was inspired by anime. The game was aimed at both casual and hardcore gamers, as well as fans of action games and robot games. The hardest part of development was to handle the sense of scale involved with the robots. The game's engine was originally intended to be for a game based on the tokusatsu series Tekk≈çki Mikazuki and even received a playable demo, though the full game was later cancelled, likely due to the commercial failure of the show itself. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights and two sevens for a total of 30 out of 40. By its second week of sale in Japan, Robot Alchemic Drive had sold 17,888 copies.

This reactor was designed and is used to test nuclear fuels and materials to be used in power plants, naval propulsion, research and advanced reactors. It can operate at a maximum thermal power of 250 MW and has a \\"Four Leaf Clover\\" core design (similar to the Camunian rose) that allows for a variety of testing locations. The unique design allows for different neutron flux (number of neutrons impacting one square centimeter every second) conditions in various locations. Six of the test locations allow an experiment to be isolated from the primary cooling system, providing its own environment for temperature, pressure, flow and chemistry, replicating the physical environment while accelerating the nuclear conditions. The ATR is a pressurized light water reactor (LWR), using water as both coolant and moderator. The core is surrounded by a beryllium neutron reflector to concentrate neutrons on experiments, and houses multiple experiment positions as well. It operates at low temperature and pressure 71 ¬∞C (160 ¬∞F) and up to 2.69 MPa water pressure. The ATR reactor vessel is solid stainless steel, tall by across. The core is approximately tall by across. In addition to its role in nuclear fuels and materials irradiation, the ATR is the United States' only domestic source of high specific activity (HSA) cobalt-60 (60Co) for medical applications. HSA 60Co is used primarily in gamma knife treatment of brain cancer. Other medical and industrial isotopes have also been produced, and could be again, including plutonium-238 (238Pu), which is useful for powering spacecraft.  History  ATR core, powered up. The serpentine arrangement of fuel plates can be seen glowing bright blue. This is due to thumb Since 1951, fifty-two reactors have been built on the grounds of what was originally the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station, currently the location of the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Constructed in 1967, the ATR is the second-oldest of three reactors still in operation at the site. Its primary function is to intensely bombard samples of materials and fuels with neutrons to replicate long-term exposure to high levels of radiation, as would be present after years in a commercial nuclear reactor. The ATR is one of only four test reactors in the world with this capability. The reactor also produces rare isotopes for use in medicine and industry.  National Scientific User Facility  In April 2007, the ATR was designated a National Scientific User Facility, since renamed a Nuclear Science User Facility (NSUF), to encourage use of the reactor by universities, laboratories, and industry. This status is intended to stimulate experiments to extend the life of existing commercial reactors and encourage nuclear power development. These experiments will test \\"materials, nuclear fuel, and instruments that operate in the reactors.\\" Under this program, experimenters will not have to pay to perform experiments at the reactor, but are required to publish their findings. Through the NSUF system, ATR and partner facilities have hosted 213 awarded experiments from 42 different institutions (universities, national labs and industry), resulting in 178 publications and presentations.  ATR compared with commercial reactors  Test reactors are very different in appearance and design from commercial, nuclear power reactors. Commercial reactors are large, operate at high temperature and pressure, and require a large amount of nuclear fuel. A typical commercial reactor has a volume of with of uranium at and 177 atm. Because of their large size and stored energy, commercial reactors require a robust \\"containment structure\\" to prevent the release of radioactive material in the event of an emergency situation. By contrast, the ATR requires a smaller containment structure‚Äîit has a volume of , contains of uranium, and operates at and 26.5 atm (conditions similar to a water heater). The reactor vessel itself, which is made of stainless steel surrounded by concrete that extends more than underground, is hardened against accidental or intentional damage. The entire reactor area is also surrounded by a confinement structure (as opposed to a \\"containment structure\\") designed to further protect the surrounding environment from any potential release of radioactivity.  Reactor design and experimental capabilities  The ATR core is designed to be as flexible as possible for research needs. It can be brought online and powered down safely as often as necessary to change experiments or perform maintenance. The reactor is also powered down automatically in the event of abnormal experimental conditions or power failure. Components of the reactor core are replaced every 7‚Äì10 years to prevent fatigue due to exposure to radiation and to ensure experimenters always have a new reactor to work with. The neutron flux provided by the reactor can be either constant or variable, and each lobe of the four-leaf-clover design can be controlled independently to produce up to 1015 thermal neutrons per second per square centimeter or 5¬∑1014 fast neutrons s‚àí1 cm‚àí2. There are 77 different testing locations inside the reflector and another 34 low-intensity locations outside the core, allowing many experiments to run simultaneously in different test environments. Test volumes up to in diameter and long can be accommodated. Experiments are changed on average every seven weeks, and the reactor is in nominal operation (110 MW) 75% of the year. Three types of experiments can be performed in the reactor: # Static Capsule Experiment: The material to be tested is placed in a sealed tube made of aluminium, stainless steel, or zircaloy, which is then inserted in the desired reactor location. If the tube is less than the full 48-inch reactor height, several capsules may be stacked. In some cases, it is desirable to test materials (such as fuel elements) in direct contact with the reactor coolant, in which case, the test capsule is not sealed. Very limited monitoring and temperature control are available for the static capsule configuration, and any instances would have to be built into the capsule experiment (such as temperature melt wires or an insulating air gap). # Instrumented Lead Experiment: Similar to the Static Capsule configuration, this type of experiment allows for real-time monitoring of temperature and gas conditions inside the capsule. An umbilical connects the test capsule to a control station to report test conditions. The control station automatically regulates the temperature inside the test capsule as desired by pumping a combination of helium (conducting) and neon or argon (nonconducting) gases through the capsule. The circulated gas can be examined though gas-liquid chromatography to test for failure or oxidation of the material being tested. # Pressurized Water Loop Experiment: More complex than the Instrumented Lead configuration, this type of experiment is available in only six of the nine flux tubes, referred to as Inpile Tubes (IPTs). Test material is isolated from the primary ATR coolant by a secondary coolant system, allowing for precise conditions of a commercial or naval reactor to be simulated. Extensive instrumentation and control systems in this type of experiment generate a large amount of data, which is available to the experimenter in real-time so that changes can be made to the experiment as required. Research experiments at the reactor include: * Advanced Graphite Capsule: This experiment will test the effects of radiation on several types of graphite under consideration for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant program that currently have no high-flux temperature data available. * Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative / Light Water Reactor: The goal of the AFCI is to transmute longer-life fuels into shorter-life ones which would be able to be used in commercial light water reactors, to reduce the amount of waste that must be stored while increasing the fuel available for commercial reactors. * Cobalt-60 Production: The least complex of current uses of the Advanced Test Reactor is the production of the 60Co radioisotope for medical uses. Disks of cobalt-59 1 mm -diameter by 1 mm thick are inserted into the reactor (Static Capsule Experiment), which bombards the sample with neutrons, producing cobalt-60. Approximately are produced per year, entirely for medical uses.

The measure is used in medical imaging to quantify the quality of acquired images. It is a difficult quantity to define, because it depends on the human observer as much as the quality of the actual image. For example, the size of a feature affects how easily it is detected by the observer. One definition of image contrast is: : C = \\\\frac{S_A-S_B}{S_A+S_B} where SA and SB are signal intensities for signal producing structures A and B in the region of interest. A disadvantage of this definition is that the contrast C can be negative. An alternative definition is: : C = \\\\frac {S_A- S_B}{S_\\\\mathrm{ref}} where Sref is a reference signal intensity, which is independent of the type of signal producing structure under investigation. This series of pictures shows that the number of row of holes that are perceived decreases as the image contrast decreases from 5.1% to 3.7% to 2.2% to 1% (left to right) In MRI, determining contrast is of high importance for calibration because the operator has a high degree of control of how the signal intensities of various structures vary in the images by using different MRI methods and imaging parameters. Unlike most other imaging modalities, such as x-ray CT in which the Hounsfield units value for water is set to zero, there is no standard reference signal for MRI. Thus the contrast-to-noise ratio is often employed as an index for contrast because this metric does not require a reference signal. Contrast resolution or contrast-detail is an approach to describing the image quality in terms of both the image contrast and resolution. Contrast resolution is usually measured by generating a pattern from a test object that depicts how image contrast changes as the structures being imaged get smaller and closer together. The picture below shows one such set of images produced using the low contrast detectability inserts of the phantom employed in the MRI accreditation program of the American College of Radiology.

He is most famous for the grasshopper weathervane atop of Faneuil Hall, well known as a symbol of Boston. Background He was born near Sturgeon Creek in what is now Eliot, York County, Maine. He was the third son of Leonard Drowne, a shipbuilder who came from Penryn, Cornwall to what was then part of Kittery in Massachusetts. Leonard helped organize and build the first Baptist Church in Maine in 1682. During King William's War many Maine towns were raided and English settlements were massacred by the Wabanaki Indians in conjunction with the French. In 1696, 28 members of the Baptist Church moved to Charleston, South Carolina and established the first Baptist church there. The Drownes moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1699 due to the ongoing war and violence. Shem married Katherine Clark on September 18, 1712 in Boston. Katherine was the daughter of Capt. Timothy Clark and sister of Boston brazier and pewterer, Jonas Clark. Shem's older brother Solomon was the grandfather of Revolutionary War Surgeon Solomon Drowne. In 1721, he was made a deacon of the First Baptist Church of Boston. Simeon Drowne, Shem's younger brother, was the fourth son of Leonard Drowne. Born April 8, 1686 and died in Boston on August 2, 1734. Buried in Copps Hill Cemetery in Boston. He was a shipwright. It is believed that he created the framework for Shem's Grasshopper weathervane. Life Shemhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/48764.htm was a coppersmith with a shop on Ann Street (now North Street) in the North End. He was baptized in the First Baptist Church of Boston in 1713 along with the future pastor of that church. In May 1721, he was elected a Deacon of the church and served this position until his death in 1774.Wood, Nathan. \\"The History of the First Baptist Church of Boston (1665-1899)\\" American Baptist Publication Society, 1899. p201-206, p368 Career: pioneering metalworker and North America's first weathervane maker  According to the colonial diarist Thomas Newell, Shem Drowne \\"was the first tin plate worker that ever came to Boston, New England.\\"Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society for October 1877 xv 348 He worked as a tin plate worker and a coppersmith.

Drown, were all notable practicing silversmiths from Portsmouth, New Hampshire.http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-drowne- silversmiths-of-portsmouth/ In 1716, he created America's first authenticated weathervane, a gilded American Indian archer, for the cupola of Providence House in Boston, which in 1716 became the official residence of the royal governor. In 1721 he created a rooster weathervane (also known as the weathercock) for the New Brick Church on Hanover St, the vane is now on First Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1740 he made the copper swallow-tailed banner weathervane that is now atop Old North Church in Boston. The Grasshopper Weathervane Faneuil Hall in 1740 His most famous work is the weathervane on top of Faneuil Hall. Commissioned by Peter Faneuil in 1742, it was designed to complement the grasshopper weathervane atop the Royal Exchange in the City of London, and help symbolize the new building as the capital of finance in the New World. The grasshopper is copper gilded with gold leaf with glass eyes. The vane fell off the building during the earthquake of 1755 which shook Boston. He and his son Thomas repaired it and remounted it. In 1768 Thomas placed a note labeled \\"food for the grasshopper\\" in the belly of the grasshopper. It read: The weathervane is the only part of Faneuil Hall which remains totally unmodified from the original 1742 structure. In 1805, Charles Bulfinch expanded the building and moved the cupola from the middle of the building to the front. In 1974 the vane was stolen but recovered in less than a week. Drowne's Wooden Image Nathaniel Hawthorne credited Shem Drowne for being the inspiration for his retelling of Pygmalion (mythology), Drowne's Wooden Image, in his collection of shorts in Mosses from an Old Manse. His short story, first published in 1844, recasts \\"Deacon Drowne\\" as a woodcarver who made trade signs and wooden figures for various shops and a notable statue of Admiral Edward Vernon in Boston.Gross, Elbridge H. \\"Shem Drowne and His Handiwork\\" Bay State Monthly Vol 3  https://books.google.com/books?id=VrMVAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA33&lpg;=PA33&dq;=drowne's+wooden+image+%22shem+drowne%22&source;=bl&ots;=7FFnatgC3-&sig;=N-tIQ3T0swFQe0B4UtGxBy2SNy4&hl;=en&ei;=pfZ1TLGGH4TGlQf7mJHsCw&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=9&ved;=0CDQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q;=drowne's%20wooden%20image%20%22shem%20drowne%22&f;=false In the story \\"Deacon Drowne\\" is approached by a ship-captain to produce a figurehead for his brig, claiming \\"nothing like the brig ever swam the ocean, so I am determined she shall have such a figurehead as old Neptune never saw in his life\\" and giving secret instructions for its completion. During the story, Drowne is visited by contemporary Bostonian artist John Singleton Copley who is impressed by his craftsmanship and inquires about his unfinished work and returns daily to check on the progress of the figurehead.Hawthorne, Nathaniel. \\"Drowne's Wooden Image\\" 1844  http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer- new2?id=HawDrow.sgm&images;=images/modeng&data;=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag;=public‚àÇ=1&division;=div1 There is no evidence that the real Shem Drowne did any carving, but the story clearly references him as the creator of the American Indian Archer weathervane. The Drowne claim of the Pemaquid Patent In 1631, the Plymouth Council for New England granted two merchants from Bristol, England, Robert Aldsworth and Gyles Elbridge, near what would become Bristol, Maine in a document known as the Pemaquid Patent. Gyles survived Aldworth and passed it to his son John, who in turn passed it to his brother Thomas. In 1650, Thomas Elbridge mortgaged Monhegan Island and Damariscove Island to Richard Russell, and sold half the Patent's land, half of his furniture, and half of his cattle for ¬£200 to Paul White. In 1653, White and Elbridge conveyed the entire Moiety title to Russell and Nicholas Davidson, who in turn became sole owner of the patents from Russell in 1657.Otis, James. \\"The Story of Pemaquid\\".

S.N. 1899, p56 After the Second Anglo-Dutch War the Duke of York claimed the land as his under a Royal Charter. Drowne's wife Katherine Clark, was a partial heir to the Davidson claim of the Pemaquid Patents, and Drowne acquired power of attorney from the other heirs. What became known as the \\"Drowne Claim\\" encompassed Bristol, Bremen, Damariscotta, and parts of Newcastle and Nobleboro.Greene, Francis Byron. \\"History of Boothbay, Southport and Boothbay Harbor, Maine. 1623-1905: With Family Genealogies\\" Loring, 1906. p165 Other claims of the time included the \\"Brown Right\\" and the \\"Tappen Right.\\" Starting in the 1730s, Drowne filed a number of depositions in order to gain control of the Drowne Claim. On June 12, 1746, he bought Monhegan Island and its surrounding islands for ¬£10, 13 shillings. His son later sold the island for ¬£160. He died in 1774 and his estate bequested ¬£6, 13s, 4d to the First Baptist Church of Boston.Wood 1899, 370 In popular culture Shem Drowne is mentioned in the video game Fallout 4, and the grasshopper weathervane atop Faneuil Hall and the note Thomas placed within are central to the side-quest \\"The Gilded Grasshopper\\".

Description  Tanekaha is a medium-sized forest tree growing up to 25 m in height and 1 m trunk diameter. The main structural shoots are green for 2‚Äì3 years, then turn brown as the bark thickens. The leaves are sparse, tiny, scale-like, 2‚Äì3 mm long, and only green (photosynthetic) for a short time, soon turning brown. Most photosynthesis is performed by highly modified, leaf-like short shoots called phylloclades; these are arranged alternately, 10-15 on a shoot, the individual phylloclades rhombic, 1.5-2.5 cm long. The seed cones are berry-like, with a fleshy white aril surrounding but not fully enclosing the single seed.  Distribution  In the North Island this species is found in lowland forests from Te Paki to 40¬∞S. In the South Island this species is found in northern Marlborough and Nelson to 41¬∞30'S.

Set in Rome and Imperial Spain during the spring and summer of AD 73, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the setting of much of the action, Corduba, as well as to the olive oil which features heavily in the plot, one use of which is for lamp oil.  Plot summary  The Society of Olive Oil Producers of Baetica is throwing a big dinner party in Rome, trying to drum up business for their product. Falco is invited at the request of Claudius Laeta, Vespasian‚Äôs top clerk. The food, the garum and the dancing girl make a big impression on Falco. When two guests at a dinner are assaulted, one fatally, Falco realizes that being at the dinner was just the start of another job. The surviving victim, Anacrites, is Falco's rival and Vespasian's Chief Spy, a significant position in Vespasian's empire, challenged as it was by constant conspiracies. Falco is asked to investigate the attack on Anacrites and its possible connection to an attempt to corner the market on Spanish olive oil. Trying to keep Anacrites safe, he moves him to the one place where no one will look, and if they do, they will regret it; his mother‚Äôs house. Soon, Falco is on his way to Hispania to track down some of the guests and that memorable dancer. Laeta hints that someone is looking to corner the market on Hispania‚Äôs olive oil production. Suspicion immediately falls on Quinctius Attractus, the host of the festivities that fatal evening. This is an assignment Falco does not take solo; he is bringing his very pregnant companion, Helena Justina. Helena's father Camillus Verus happens to own a small estate in Baetica, and her brother Aelianus has just returned for serving there, so he and Helena have a perfect excuse to show up. And Helena has made it very clear that Falco will be there for the birth of his child. Helena becomes friendly with the daughters of two local magnates, Claudia Rufina and Aelia Annaea. Falco gets to know some of the sons, including Claudia‚Äôs brother Constans. Also appearing is Attractus‚Äô son Quadratus, the new quaestor of Baetica. That one item alone keeps Falco on guard. While concluding the interviews of the dinner guests, Falco finally catches up with the dancer, Selia, who promptly tries to kill him with the help of her band. Before she strikes the final blow, she reveals that Laeta sent her too, not to find the killer, but to stop anyone following, a classic double cross. Now Falco knows all, or nearly all. Falco suspects something, but the obvious suspect is his guest and claiming an injury. Yet Claudia is convinced it was not an accident, and she asks Falco to investigate. Seeing the site of the death, he is convinced someone else was there when Constans died. Now it is just one more thing he has to prove. Now the chase is on. Falco goes to the Quinctius estate, and finds Selia dead and Quadratus gone. But this death is much more elegant, and soon another Dancer appears; Perella. She is working for the Chief Spy Anacrites, who was still alive when she saw him last, now with the Praetorian guard, but still being nursed by Falco‚Äôs mother. Still not trusting Perella, Falco decides to share his information with her, and they piece together the real plot. Attractus and Quadratus are part of the plan because Laeta needs some legitimacy, and the Quinctii have enough influence to make it at least appear to be on the up and up. Falco also learns that Quadratus was indeed with Constans when he died. It is now time to act. Helena is about to burst, but Falco is still fearful of local medical experts, and so he sends her east by land while he rides to catch Quadratus before he kills someone else, and then hopes to catch up. It‚Äôs a girl. Falco makes it before the birth, Helena survives, and only breaks a couple of his fingers. Characters in A Dying Light in Corduba =Romans= * A.

Pangasinan is spoken primarily in the province of Pangasinan in the Philippines, located on the west central area of the island of Luzon along the Lingayen Gulf. History The earliest known written records in the Pangasinan language were written in the ancient Pangasinan script, a writing system related to the Tagalog Baybayin script and the Javanese Kavi script. The Pangasinan script, like the other writing systems used in ancient Southeast Asia were probably influenced by the Brahmi script of ancient India and originated from the Sumerian cuneiform script that was used in the ancient land of Sumer in Mesopotamia where the earliest known written records were found. The Latin alphabet was introduced after the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan in 1571. During the Spanish colonial period, the use of the Latin alphabet became more widespread.

It declared that the local governments have the power to penalize these crimes. In the specific case, four men were removed from a Crockett County, Tennessee jail by a group led by Sheriff R. G. Harris and 19 others. The four men were beaten and one was killed. A deputy sheriff tried to prevent the act, but failed.

History The cemetery was opened in June 1936, during South Australia's centennial year, although the first burial was not until 1938, when there were only ten in that year. The cemetery contains a war graves plot known locally as Adelaide War Cemetery (marked on the plan as War Graves Plots), established by the Australian Army in 1942, holding the graves of 215 Commonwealth service personnel of World War II, primarily from local hospitals. Most of the graves are either side of the central path from the Goodwood Road entrance. In 1946 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission took over the plot and erected a Cross of Sacrifice, the first erected by the commission in the Southern Hemisphere. Near the cross is the South Australia Cremation Memorial to nine Australian service personnel who were cremated during the same war in the state of South Australia.CWGC Cemetery report In 1955, the W.A. Norman Chapel was opened and included one of the state's first crematoria (the first was opened at West Terrace Cemetery in the 1903).

History The municipality of Grindum was established on 1 January 1902 when the old municipality of Bjelland og Grindum was divided into two separate municipalities: Grindheim (population: 909) and Bjelland (population: 907). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Grindheim (population: 701) was merged with the √Ögedal and Midtb√∏ areas (located just east of the lake Ytre √òydnavatnet; population: 96) in Bjelland and the neighboring municipality of Konsmo (population: 712) to create the new municipality of Audnedal. Name The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old Grindheim farm (Old Norse: Grindheimr), since the first Grindheim Church was built there. The first element is grind which means \\"gate\\" or \\"wicket\\" (or possibly grind which means \\"sand\\" or \\"gravel\\") and the last element is heimr which means \\"home\\", \\"homestead\\", or \\"farm\\". Prior to 1889, the name was written as Grindem. Then from 1889 to 1917, the spelling was changed to Grindum. Then again in 1918, the spelling was changed to its present form: Grindheim.

He played for the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL) until he retired from the club at the end of the 2013 season. Davey finished runner-up to the AFL Rising Star in 2004. He is one of few successful top-level footballers to have been elevated from the rookie list. Davey's representative honours include twice playing for Australia against Ireland in 2005 and 2006. Davey was a cult figure at the Melbourne Football Club and a highly popular player with young Demons fans. Davey's achievements at Melbourne include a Best and Fairest for an outstanding 2009 season. Davey is also a recognised leader of Melbourne's young indigenous group of players. Early years Davey, of Indigenous Australian ancestry with tribal ancestry that can be traced to the Kokatha in South Australia,AFL Record. Round 9,2009. Slattery Publishing. pg 75. was born to mother Lizzie and father Alwyn DaveyFlanagan, M., \\"The Davey pacesetters \\", Real Footy, 9 May 2007. Retrieved on 9 May 2007. with siblings Alwyn (named after his father who died when Aaron was nine) and Bronwyn. The boys were raised in Darwin in the Northern Territory. Davey started playing football as a forward pocket player in the Northern Territory Football League for the Palmerston Football Club. He moved to Melbourne to further his prospects of an Australian rules career, and trialled with the Port Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL). After an exceptional debut season in the VFL, Davey was voted the VFL player most likely to succeed AFL level. In 2003, Sandringham Coach Graeme Yeats believed \\"Davey is the fastest VFL-listed player in the competition\\" Surprisingly he was overlooked by all clubs in the 2003 AFL Draft. However, he caught the eye of Melbourne Football Club talent scouts and was selected at Pick No. 3 in the rookie draft. When later asked on Before the Game, why Davey was not selected in the AFL Draft, Melbourne's former coach Neale Daniher responded by postulating that clubs were not on the lookout for short indigenous players after the possessionless display of Leon Davis in the 2002 Grand Final.Before the Game AFL career =Debut Season: 2004= Davey debuted in the 2004 Wizard Cup, playing a handful of sensational pre-season games before debuting in the senior side in the first round of 2004. In his first AFL game, the lightly built forward kicked a goal and totalled an impressive 13 possessions, receiving a nomination for the AFL Rising Star award. In his next 15 games, Davey won wide acclaim for his blistering acceleration, evasive footwork and goal sense. He was likened to Essendon player Andrew Lovett, another young indigenous player. In particular, Davey's ability to run down opposition players with explosive acceleration, his hard tackling and his \\"one percenter\\" second and third efforts at the ball earned him the respect of coaches and players across the league. Davey formed a potent forward line combination, crumbing the likes of Russell Robertson and David Neitz. He quickly became a cult hero, particularly amongst young supporters, and a face of the Melbourne Football Club. Davey played the rest of the season until a hamstring injury in round 16 against the Western Bulldogs at the Telstra Dome put him out for four games. He returned for the finals and played in a losing elimination final against Essendon. At the end of the season, Davey won the AFLPA best first year player, which has been awarded to many superstars of the game, notably Brownlow Medallists Chris Judd and Adam Goodes. =Season 2005= In 2005, Davey played all 22 games and another losing elimination final, this time against Geelong. He was selected for the International rules series as one of only three Demons players. Davey was selected along with Lovett and several other indigenous players in Kevin Sheedy's handpicked squad. Topping off a sensational season, Davey finished third in the club best and fairest behind Travis Johnstone and Russell Robertson respectively. In that year, Davey won the AFL Players Association Marn Grook Award for Best Emerging Indigenous Player and was one of three indigenous players in the Demons line-up to hail from Darwin, along with Matthew Whelan and Shannon Motlop. The three played with each other in the local Darwin junior football. The injection of Byron Pickett into the Demons side provided Davey with a football mentor and it was about this time that Davey began to show a little onfield aggression. =Season 2006= In 2006, Davey's versatility and added bulk saw him used in the forward line, midfield and even at times defence. Initially, football commentators on 3AW, especially Rex Hunt, referred to him as \\"Jack Davey\\" ‚Äì a reference to a former Australian radio quiz show host Jack Davey, whose trademark greeting at the opening of the show was \\"Hi Ho, everybody!\\" Due to this it is not uncommon to hear 3AW replay a soundbite of Jack Davey saying \\"Hi Ho, everybody\\" whenever Davey scores a goal. But more recently (from 2006 onwards), he has been widely referred to as \\"Flash\\" by many commentators for his incredible pace and acceleration. In another exciting season, he achieved a total of three Goal of the Year nominations, including back-to-back weeks of soccer style strikes.\\"Just give Aaron the car now!\\" aboriginalfootball.com.au 12 July 2006. URL accessed 7 September 2006 =Season 2007= He played for the Indigenous All-Stars in the pre-season against Essendon, where he re-injured his hamstring. Despite the Demons horror season, with Melbourne winning only five games for the year, Davey produced a career best game in round 7 against the Western Bulldogs, collecting 29 disposals and kicking three goals, for which he received two Brownlow Medal votes, the equivalent to second best on ground. As the season continued the Demons struggled and Davey's increasing aggression saw him suspended for two games for striking Brisbane Lions player Troy Selwood at the Gabba in round 15. =Season 2008= His 2008 was a struggle with injuries in a year that the club was not performing well. =Season 2009= After starring for the Indigenous All-Stars against Adelaide in the 2009 pre-season, Davey's 2009 season started strongly. Even though his club continued to struggle. Under new coach Dean Bailey, Davey was switched to the midfield with devastating effect. His round four performance against Richmond was instrumental to the win. Even though the club had a poor year, Davey personally had an outstanding year. Davey's year was capped off by winning the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Medal, which is awarded to Melbourne's Best and Fairest player. =Season 2010= Davey's 2010 season was not as successful as the year before and, although he remained one of Melbourne's better players and their main playmaker, he was not as damaging as the previous season.

The story deals with a Druze wedding and the troubles the politically unresolved situation creates for the personal lives of the people in and from the village. The movie's plot looks at the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict through the story of a family divided by political borders, and explores how their lives are fractured by the region's harsh political realities. The film has garnered critical acclaim and has won or been nominated internationally for several notable awards. Plot Set in the summer of 2000, Mona (Clara Khoury), a young Druze woman living at Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, is about to marry a successful Syrian actor. Following the hostilities between Israel and Syria there is now a zone manned by UNDOF in the Golan Heights. Crossing of the zone is extremely rare as it is only granted by both sides under special circumstances. It has taken 6 months to obtain permission from the Israeli administration for Mona to leave the Golan. When Mona crosses she will not be able to return to her family on the Golan even to visit. Mona is a bit hesitant also because she doesn't know her husband-to-be. Her father Hammed (Makram Khoury) openly supports the reunification with Syria and has just been released on bail from an Israeli prison. For this personal sacrifice he is respected by the elders of the village‚Äîyet when there is word that his son Hattem (Eyad Sheety) who has married Evelyna (Evelyn Kaplun), a Russian doctor, breaking with Druze tradition, is returning to see his sister off, they make it clear to the father that they will shun him too if he allows Hattem to come to the wedding. Mona's sister Amal (Hiam Abbass) is unhappily married and has two daughters who are almost grown up. She is considered a somewhat free spirit as she and her daughters wear trousers. Now she is even considering training as a social worker. Her elder daughter wants to marry the son of a pro-Israeli villager. Amal's husband feels put in an awkward position, as tradition demands that the male head of the family controls the other members of the family to act in a socially acceptable manner. Amal is seen advising her daughter not to give up her studies irrespective of whatever pressures she may face from the family or society. This gives insight into Amal's persona. The second brother, Marwan (Ashraf Barhom), is a shady merchant doing deals in Italy and obviously a womanizer. Yet nobody seems to object to his slightly unsettled lifestyle‚Äîquite a contrast to his brother who is only greeted by his mother and siblings. Then, after the wedding feast, the bride is escorted to the border where her emigration runs into trouble, as the Israeli government has just decided to stamp the passports of Golan residents bound for Syria as leaving Israel. The Syrian officials still regard the Golan as part of Syria under foreign occupation, and a stamp like that is viewed as an underhanded ploy by the Israelis to force the Syrian side to implicitly acknowledge the annexation. So the UN liaison officer Jeanne goes back and forth until the Israeli official who put the stamp into the passport in the first place finally agrees to erase it with some correction fluid. Yet just as the problem seems to have been peacefully resolved, the solution is threatened by a change of position on the Syrian side. In the end when it looks as if the wedding will be delayed at least for some days (which is regarded as a bad omen), the bride takes matters into her own hands. In our final view of her, she is walking with energy and determination toward the Syrian border; at the same time Amal walks away from the group with a determined face as if she would shatter the invisible fences which prevent her from pursuing her dreams.

The municipality was in the central part of the present-day municipality of Lindesnes. The administrative centre was the village of Vigeland where Valle Church is. Name The municipality was named S√∏r-Audnedal, which means \\"southern Audnedal\\", since it is the southern part of the old Audnedal municipality, which encompassed the Audnedalen valley. The name Audnedal (Old Norse: Au√∞nudalr) is from the Audna river (Old Norse: Au√∞na), which runs through the valley (\\"-dalr\\") and empties into the Snigsfjorden. The river name means \\"destruction\\". Historically, the municipality was named S√∏r-Undal or S√∏ndre Undal, which uses an older version of the valley name (and an alternate way of spelling \\"southern\\"). History The municipality of S√∏ndre Undal was established in 1845 when the old Undal municipality was divided into Nordre Undal (population: 802) and S√∏ndre Undal (population: 3,893). The name was later changed to S√∏r-Audnedal. On 1 January 1899, the western part of S√∏r-Audnedal (population: 1,734) was separated to become the new municipality of Spangereid. The split left S√∏r-Audnedal with 2,958 inhabitants. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, S√∏r-Audnedal municipality (population: 2,323) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Vigmostad (population: 589) and Spangereid (population: 899) to create the new municipality of Lindesnes.

She also ran the Practical Patchwork Company, a quilt pattern-making business from her home in Wabash, Indiana, for more than thirty years. Webster's appliqu√©d quilts influenced modern quilting designs of the early twentieth century. Her quilts have been featured in museums and gallery exhibition in the United States and Japan. The Indianapolis Museum of Art holds the largest collection of her quilts in the United States. Webster was inducted into the Quilters Hall of Fame in 1991. The Marie Webster House, her former residence in Marion, Indiana, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993, and serves as the present-day home of the Quilters Hall of Fame. Early life and education Marie Daugherty was born on July 19, 1859 in Wabash, Indiana to Minerva Harriet (Lumaree) and Josiah Scott Daugherty. She was oldest of the family's six children. Her father was an entrepreneur, bank president, and civic leader in Wabash. During her childhood, Daugherty learned the art of fine handsewing from her mother.. Also: . She was educated in the Wabash public schools, graduating from Union School in Wabash in 1878. Daugherty's parents discouraged her from attending college and she had no formal art training. Although needlework became a favorite pastime of hers, she did not start designing quilts until the age of fifty.. Marriage and family Webster's house in Marion Marie Daugherty married George Webster Jr. of Marion, Indiana on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1884. Their only child, a son named Lawrence Burns Webster, was born on October 29, 1884. He became a Harvard-trained mechanical engineer and married Jeannette Scott.. Marie and George Webster established their home in Marion where they spent most of their fifty-four years of married life. Marie was devoted to her family, active in social and volunteer projects, and enjoyed reading, sewing, and amateur theater, while George became a banker and was active in civic affairs, including service on Wabash's school and library boards. The couple built a Colonial Revival-style home in Marion in 1902.. The couple also traveled in the United States and in Europe until George's severe rheumatoid arthritis forced his retirement from the bank around 1910 and ended their travels. Around 1909 Marie took up quilting while caring for her ailing husband. George Webster died in 1938. After her husband's death, Webster and her sister, Emma Daugherty, stayed in the Webster home in Marion. The Websters' son, Lawrence, and his family lived nearby.. In 1942, Webster and her sister relocated to Princeton, New Jersey to join Lawrence Webster and his family.. Career =Early quilt designs= In 1909 at the age of fifty, Webster made her first appliqu√©d quilt of her own design, adapted from the traditional \\"Rose of Sharon\\" pattern using shaped pieces cut from colored fabrics and sewn to a background fabric. Webster's friends encouraged her to send the quilt to the Ladies Home Journal, whose editor asked her to provide additional samples of her work. In its January 1911 issue, the magazine featured for the first time using full-color pages, four of Webster's quilt designs (\\"Pink Rose,\\" \\"Iris,\\" \\"Snowflake,\\" and \\"Wind- blown Tulip\\") which were stylized designs inspired by her garden flowers. More of her appliqu√©d quilts were published as full-color features in the Ladies' Home Journal issues for August 1911, January 1912, and August 1912. The Journal also asked her to write articles about quilts using her name as a byline, leading the way for other professional women quilters to use their own names in association with their work.. Webster had subsequent quilt designs published in other women's magazines. In addition, her quilts were displayed in 1911 at Marshall Field's galleries in Chicago, Illinois. Exposure to her quilt designs in the Ladies' Home Journal, with a circulation at that time of about 1.5 million readers, brought Webster and her quilts national recognition. As her quilt designs became well known, requests for her patterns also increased. With her son, Lawrence, making the blueprints for her patterns and her sister, Emma Daugherty, helping make the full-size, tissue-paper patterns, Webster created kits to keep up with the demand. The kits initially sold for fifty cents each and included instructions, pattern templates, and a picture of the completed quilt. =Quilt book= In 1912, Doubleday, Page, and Company invited Webster to research and write a book about the history of quilting and pattern names. Quilts, Their Story and How to Make Them, published in October 1915, was the first full-length quilting history published in America, and it was reprinted multiple times. Webster took a broad view of the subject in her book, tracing its origins in Egypt, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Renaissance. She also included chapters on quilting techniques and quilt collections, and concluded with a list of more than 400 quilt pattern names. Although her quilting history was not footnoted, it was based on earlier reference sources and included a list of references she consulted. Webster's extensively researched book received favorable reviews from The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, The Christian Science Monitor, and the Boston Herald. A February 1916 review of her book in Gustav Stickley's The Craftsman magazine called it \\"thoroughly delightful\\" and said, \\"little has been left unsaid in this book on the pleasant matter of patchwork making\\". Webster's book brought her national and international recognition as a quilt designer and quiltmaker and increased the popularity of her designs among quilters. Her notoriety lead to additional publicity about her work, invitations to lecture, and offers to publish more of her designs. =Entrepreneur= The mail-order business operating out of Webster's home expanded after her quilt book was published in 1915, increasing the requests for her quilt patterns. Around 1921, the popularity of Webster's appliqu√© quilt designs led her to form The Practical Patchwork Company with two friends, Ida Hess and Evangeline Beshore, and her sister, Emma Daugherty. Webster operated the mail-order business out of her home with her cofounders and the additional assistance of her family members. The company, whose motto was \\"A Thing of Beauty Is a Joy Forever,\\" specialized in selling her original designs in kits that included packaged patterns, instruction sheets, and precut fabric quilting pieces. It also marketed Webster-designed, partially completed quilts and shipped them throughout the United States. The company promoted its offerings in its published catalogs (the initial four-page catalog was entitled The New Patch-work Patterns), through advertising in periodicals, such as House Beautiful, and through occasional sales to retail shops. Webster created the designs, she or others in the business appliqu√©d the pieces, and other quilters were contracted to do the quilting.. By 1930 the company's catalog included thirty-three of her designs. =Influences and inspiration= Webster designed dozens of quilts and became a leader of the early twentieth century quilting revival. Webster's designs rejected the bright colors and heavily-embroidered \\"Crazy Quilt\\" patterns of the late nineteenth century in favor of the simple, appliqu√©d quilts that were popular in the mid-nineteenth century. The Arts and Crafts Movement of the early 1900s also influenced her simple, handmade appliqu√©d quilts. The hallmarks of her work have been characterized as \\"balance, harmony, restrain, elegance, and above all, simplification.\\" Webster frequently used a palette of soft, muted pastels and modern designs that were less elaborate and more realistic, as opposed to the stylized forms and bright colors of the late Victorian era. Her appliqu√© quilt patterns became especially known for their beautiful, mostly floral designs, done in pastel colors. These qualities also made her designs unusual for that time. Her quilt motifs were typically inspired from nature, especially flowers from her garden, with popular pattern such as \\"Iris,\\" \\"Poppy,\\" \\"Daisies,\\" \\"Sunflower,\\" \\"Poinsetta,\\" \\"Morning Glory,\\" \\"Pink Rose,\\" and \\"Grapes and Vines.\\" Webster's modern quilting designs and her patterns, published in women's magazines and in advertisements for her mail-order quilting business, inspired adaptations from other quilt designers, patternmakers, and quilt producers, although they did not always attribute her for the original design idea. Later years During the 1920 and 1930s Webster wrote articles for periodicals; however, she did not create any new designs for a time after her husband died in 1938, and friends and associates ran the business. When she was about seventy years of age, two of her quilts were featured in Needlecraft, a home arts magazine. Webster and her associates continued to operate the Practical Patchwork Company from her home in Marion, Indiana until she retired at the age of eighty-three in 1942. Webster and her sister, Emma Daugherty, left the mail-order business in Indiana to join her son and his family after they moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Death and legacy After suffering a stroke from which she never fully recovered, Webster died in Princeton, New Jersey on August 29, 1956, at the age of ninety-seven. She is remembered as a pioneer in the design, production, marketing, and selling of quilt patterns, as well as a quilt lecturer and author of Quilts: Their Story and How to Make Them, America's first full- length book on the history of quilts. Webster also ran a quilt pattern-making business from her home in Wabash, Indiana, for more than thirty years. Several sources recognize the influence that Webster's appliqu√©d quilts had on quilting designs of the twentieth century. Webster was inducted into the Quilters Hall of Fame in 1991. Her former residence on South Washington Street in Marion, Indiana, where she lived from 1902 to 1942, it the present-day home of the Quilters Hall of Fame. Also referred to as the Marie Webster House, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Note: This includes and accompanying photographs. Webster's quilts have been featured in museums and galleries in the United States and in Japan, beginning with an exhibition at Marshall Field's galleries in Chicago, Illinois in 1911. \\"Marie Webster Quilts: A Retrospective,\\" a traveling exhibition, was shown in the 1990s at the Indianapolis Museum of Art; the American Museum of Quilts and Textiles in San Jose, California; the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City; the Spencer Museum of Art in Lawrence, Kansas; and in 2000 at the IMA-Columbus Gallery in Columbus, Indiana. Twenty-four Webster-designed quilts, along with others created by quilt designers Rose Kretsinger and Carrie Hall, were featured in the \\"American Applique Quilt\\" exhibition in 1998 in galleries and museums throughout Japan, including in Tokyo. Webster's work was also shown in other exhibitions, including those at the Bard Graduate School of Design in New York City in 2000‚Äì01, the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 2001, and at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis in 2001‚Äì02. The Indianapolis Museum of Art holds the largest collection of her quilts in the United States.

He was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1999 to 2015, representing the Colac-based electorate of Polwarth. He served as Minister for Public Transport and Minister for Roads in the Baillieu and Napthine governments from 2010 to 2014. Mulder was born in Colac, and attended Trinity College, but did not complete high school and began working as a laborer. He was employed by the Postmaster General's Office from 1967 to 1978 before going into business, serving as managing director of a property management company from 1978 to 1999. Mulder also worked as a consultant from 1994 to 1999.  Political background  Mulder joined the Liberal Party in 1992, and was an active member of his local branch thereafter, serving as its vice-president from 1993 to 1995 and president from 1995 to 1999. He subsequently won preselection to contest the safe seat of Polwarth upon the resignation of long-serving Ian Smith. He was easily elected, and was a popular backbencher for most of his first term. Mulder was promoted to the ministry in a reshuffle ahead of the 2002 election, serving as Shadow Minister for Water Resources. Mulder was easily re-elected at the 2002 election, despite a statewide routing of the Liberal Party and a challenge from renowned Geelong football player Paul Couch, who ran in Polwarth as a National Party candidate. The defeat of several shadow ministers opened up a number of vacancies in the shadow cabinet after the election, and Mulder was promoted to the position of Shadow Minister for Transport and Shadow Minister for Ports. As Shadow Minister for Transport, Mulder became one of the highest-profile members of the opposition, leading attacks on cost blow-outs over the Regional Fast Rail project and the rebuilding of Spencer Street station, the badly delayed Craigieburn railway line extension and the controversial siting of the Marshall railway station. With the party continuing to generally struggle, however, Mulder began to be seen as a potential replacement for leader Robert Doyle. Mulder was seen as an outside chance to become leader throughout 2005 and early 2006, and briefly emerged as a contender to succeed Doyle when he stepped down in May 2006. He was endorsed by Doyle as his chosen replacement, but withdrew when it became clear that Ted Baillieu, Doyle's chief rival, had the numbers to succeed him. Following the 2010 state election, In 2008 Mulder was one of the Liberal mp's to oppose the legalized abortion act introduced by the Brumby Government which saw abortion legal up to twenty four weeks and up to the moment of birth if two doctors grant approval.http://www.lifevote.org.au/politician.php?id=54&area;=Victoriahttp://www.abc.net.au/stateline/vic/content/2006/s2363260.htm = Minister for Public Transport and Roads = Mulder was appointed the Minister for Public Transport and Minister for Roads in 2010 As Minister for Public Transport, Mulder oversaw the Taxi Industry Inquiry, the creation of Public Transport Victoria, construction of the Regional Rail Link and new railway stations at Waurn Ponds and Epsom, the removal of five level crossings in Springvale, Mitcham and Sunshine, orders for 15 new X'Trapolis 100 trains and 43 V/Line VLocity railcars, the Bayside Rail upgrade, and the addition of more than 10,000 extra weekly train, tram and bus trips on the public transport network. As Minister for Roads, Mulder introduced tougher penalties for hoon, drink and drug driving as part of a new Road Safety Strategy, abolished registration stickers on vehicles, established the Country Roads and Bridges Program, oversaw construction of the Ballarat West Link Road, Dingley Bypass and Koo Wee Rup Bypass and oversaw planning and upgrades of the Princes Highway between Traralgon and Sale, and between Geelong and Colac, the M80 Ring Road and the Western Highway (Victoria) between Ballarat and Ararat. Mulder also oversaw planning and development of the East West Link project. =Opposition and resignation= The 2014 Victorian state election saw the Coalition government defeated by the Labor Party after one term in government, with Mulder was re-elected for his fifth term as member for Polwarth He went to the backbench and did not take a position on the Coalition's shadow ministry along with seven other former ministers. On 31 August 2015, Mulder announced that he would resign from the Victorian Parliament on 3 September, which triggered a by-election in his seat. Former Premier Denis Napthine had announced his resignation earlier on the same day.

The Commons area frequently features events such as live concerts, festivals, and a farmers' market. Anchored by JCPenney and Target, North Hills includes nearly 100 stores such as REI, Ethan Allen, Fink's Jewelers, Anthropologie, Learning Express and Plow and Hearth. Restaurants include Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Firebirds, Vivace, Mura, Coquette, Fox & Hound Pub & Grill along with more casual options such as Zoe's Kitchen, Five Guys, Moe's Southwest Grill and Panera Bread. It also features the Regal North Hills Stadium 14 movie theater, a Fitness Connection, Genealogy Boutique & Formals, Natural Body Spa and other service businesses. The 223-room Renaissance Raleigh Hotel offers 4-star accommodations on the property as well.  History  Captrust Tower at North Hills In Raleigh North Hills Mall originally opened in 1960 and was converted to an enclosed mall in 1967. It was not only the first enclosed mall in Raleigh, it was also the first two-story, air-conditioned indoor mall between Washington, D.C. and Atlanta. It originally opened a few years earlier as a small strip center before being redeveloped into a mall. It had a simple rectangular design with two floors, the upper level opening onto Six Forks Road and the lower level facing a parking deck on Lassiter Mill Road. Anchors at that time were JCPenney, Ivey's, and Woolworth. At the opposite end of the mall from Penney, there was originally a large fountain, although this was torn down and the space became part of a restaurant, \\"Ragamuffin's\\", in 1979. A K&W; Cafeteria was a popular destination at the south end of the mall for more than three decades. North Hills Plaza, a strip center across Lassiter Mill Road, featured The Cardinal movie theater and a Winn-Dixie grocery store. Five years after North Hills was enclosed, the larger Crabtree Valley Mall opened two miles away, and began to draw shoppers. In 1984, North Hills Mall underwent extensive renovations, with several new stores brought in to fill vacant spaces. In 1990, Ivey's became Dillard's. In 1999, local developer Kane Realty Corporation purchased the deteriorating North Hills Plaza, renovating it in 2001 to create an upscale shopping and dining area now called The Lassiter at North Hills. Harris Teeter was the new anchor for The Lassiter (later replaced by Total Wine), surrounded by Starbucks, Panera Bread and a variety of local shops and services. In 2001, Kane Realty also purchased North Hills Mall from Nags Head Properties, with the intention of creating a new low-rise, pedestrian-friendly urban development that would make the area Raleigh's new midtown. At the same time, Dillard's moved to Triangle Town Center. The mall was closed in January 2003, with Kane Realty auctioning off everything from parking signs to benches and fixtures to storefronts to the public. The response to the one-day event was so great that it was extended for several additional weekends. In April, the mall was torn down shortly after, except for JCPenney and the existing parking deck, to create a mixed- use development featuring a new open air shopping center. The new North Hills officially opened in November 2004 with a Grand Illumination of holiday lights as well as performances by members of the North Carolina Symphony, North Carolina Master Chorale and North Carolina Theatre. A new underground parking deck was added, with the lower level flanked to the south by an entrance to JCPenney and to the north by a new Target. The Target featured the first shopping cart conveyor in the Carolinas--an escalator for shopping carts so customers could more easily transport purchases to a higher level of the parking deck. A 14-screen, stadium seating movie theater located directly above Target, was originally operated by Eastern Federal but is now owned by Regal Entertainment. Another phase of the development, North Hills East, opened in 2010 across Six Forks Road from North Hills Mall. It features a new two-story Harris Teeter, Sparians (now King's) upscale bowling alley, the Captrust Tower skyscraper, as well as more restaurants, shops and residential living. On January 17, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing as part of a plan to close 6 stores nationwide. The store was originally set to close on April 24, 2020, however it was delayed due to JCPenney closing all its stores temporarily due to the COVID-19 crisis. It is now set to close on July 26, 2020.https://www.wral.com/jcpenney-in-north-hills-closing-in- april/18894759/  1972 shooting  Although the original mall has been demolished and replaced with newer buildings, longtime Raleigh residents still remember Memorial Day 1972, when a sniper opened fire and killed four people, while wounding seven others, in the North Hills parking lot. The shooter, 22-year-old Harvey Glenn McLeod, hid himself between cars and methodically picked off innocent shoppers before turning his .22 caliber Ruger semi- automatic rifle (that he had purchased earlier that day) on himself and committing suicide. Initially, law enforcement and the media thought the target of the attack was U.S. Senator B. Everett Jordan, who was campaigning at the mall that day. It was later determined that McLeod's rampage was an act of random violence, although Senator Jordan's press secretary was one of the victims.
