Brentford Football Club is an English professional football club based in Brentford, Hounslow, London. The club was founded in October 1889, as the local sportsmen's latest attempt to form a permanent football or rugby club in the town. By 1896, Brentford had joined the London League, progressing to the Southern League in 1898 and entering the Football League in 1920. Upon the appointment of Harry Curtis as manager in 1926 came the beginning of Brentford's most successful period, with promotions in 1933 and 1935 taking the club into the top-flight of English football for the first and only time in its history. Three consecutive top-six finishes in the First Division established Brentford as one of the top clubs in England, but a decline began in 1938 which led to the club's relegation back to the Third Division South by 1954.  Formation and early seasons  Brentford's first ground was located behind Clifden House, close to Griffin Park. Built for Viscount Clifden, the house was demolished in the 1950s. = Founding (1889) = In 1889, the town of Brentford, Middlesex was home to the Brentford Rowing Club and Boston Park Cricket Club. Attempts to form football and rugby clubs in the town fell by the wayside until a new recreation ground was opened on 17 October 1889. Seven days earlier, a meeting had taken place at the Oxford & Cambridge pub near Kew Bridge, during which it had been endeavoured between the rowing and cricket club members to decide how best to use the recreation ground, in the hope of forming a permanent football or rugby club in the town. The rowing club's co-founder Archer Green immediately submitted an application to the Chiswick Local Board for the use of the recreation ground and a meeting with the board was called for 15 October. The result was inconclusive and it was decided that the matter would be discussed again at the board's next meeting, three weeks later. Archer Green and fellow rowing club co-founder John Henry Strachan did not wish to wait and pushed to establish a new club. On 16 October 1889, the rowing club members again met at the Oxford & Cambridge pub and it was voted that the new club would play association football, be named \\"Brentford Football Club\\" and wear salmon, claret and light blue colours, the same as that of the rowing club. J. J. K. Curtis was elected as the club's first-ever captain, with J. Hinton Bailey as vice-captain. Archer Green became secretary, while John Henry Strachan became one of six vice-presidents. The problem of the club's ground was quickly resolved, with president Edwin Underwood promising the use of a field behind the Local Board offices at Clifden House, Brentford. = Cup and friendly matches (1889‚Äì1896) = On 26 October 1889, the club staged its first practice match (featuring gentlemen who had paid a 5s annual subscription fee to become members of the club) and on 23 November the club's first competitive match was played versus Kew, which resulted in a 1‚Äì1 draw, with T. H. M. Bonell scoring Brentford's goal. From then until the end of the 1889‚Äì90 season, friendly matches would be played on most Saturdays. Brentford continued to play friendly matches during the 1890‚Äì91 season and entered the West Middlesex Cup, with the club's first ever competitive fixture ending in a 6‚Äì0 first round defeat to Southall on 8 November 1890. The 1892‚Äì93 season saw Brentford enter a league for the first time ‚Äì the West London Alliance ‚Äì and the club moved to Benn's Field, Little Ealing in October 1892. The team showed excellent form and finished the season top of the division, going undefeated and winning 10 of the 12 matches, but the board decided to against entering for the following season after failing to be awarded a trophy. By now captained by Arthur Charlton (referred to as \\"probably the club‚Äôs first great player\\"), Brentford won its first competition during the 1894‚Äì95 season, defeating 8th Hussars 4‚Äì2 in the final of the West Middlesex Cup at Fred Rouse's Field in Southall. It was also during the 1894‚Äì95 season that Brentford's original nickname of \\"The Bs\\" originated, when friends of amateur forward Joseph Gettins chanted Borough Road College's war-cry \\"buck up Bs\\" at a match. The local press interpreted the nickname as \\"the Bees\\", which stuck and came to be Brentford's nickname. = Election to the London League (1896‚Äì1898) = Brentford continued to play cup and friendly matches until 1896, when the club was elected into the Second Division of the London League. Buoyed by the goalscoring of Oakey Field and playing in front of an average home attendance of 1,500 at Shotter's Field, the Bees finished second behind Bromley to secure promotion to the First Division after losing just one match all season. Brentford had its finest season yet in its short existence in 1897‚Äì98, finishing as runners-up in the London League First Division and winning the London Senior Cup and the Middlesex Senior Cup. The only sour note was that the club had still yet to find a permanent home and finished the season having again lost money due to having to play matches on neutral grounds. Brentford would later re-enter the London League for the 1900‚Äì01 season and remained until the end of 1903‚Äì04, experiencing little success, due to the club's main focus being on the Southern League competition.  Southern League  = Second Division (1898‚Äì1901) = Brentford's London League exploits and its establishment as one of the top amateur clubs in London led to the club's election into the Second Division (London section) of the Southern League for the 1898‚Äì99 season. Several key players from the previous season departed (including prolific forward Oakey Field and captain Arthur Charlton) and the club moved to Cross Road near South Ealing station, a ground then occupied by local club Brentford Celtic. Despite secretly paying the new amateur signings more than their travelling expenses to induce them to play (an illegal move), Brentford finished fourth in the 12-team division and made its FA Cup debut, being knocked out at the first time of asking by Clapton in the third qualifying round. A mediocre 1899‚Äì00 season followed, during the middle of which, the club became a professional outfit. Everything came right for Brentford in the 1900‚Äì01 season. Now playing at Boston Park Cricket Ground and under the charge of secretary/manager William Lewis, the squad was overhauled and Peter Turnbull (supported ably by Roddy McLeod, Ralph McElhaney, Joe Turner and E. Andrews) finished the season as the Southern League's top scorer and fired the Bees to the Second Division title. A 0‚Äì0 draw with Swindon Town in the promotion/relegation test match meant the Robins would retain their First Division status, but the Brentford won a place in the top-flight in July 1901 after Gravesend United dropped out of the Southern League. = First Division (1901‚Äì1913) = Changes were afoot both on and off the pitch at York Road during the 1901 off-season, with 'The Brentford Football And Sports Club' being registered as a limited liability company and virtually an entirely new team being assembled. Deprived of new captain Bob Stormont for a time due to injury and a suspension for fighting during a match, the Bs finished 1901‚Äì02 15th in the 16-team division and were spared relegation after drawing 1‚Äì1 with Grays United in a promotion/relegation test match, which Grays forfeited after refusing to play extra time. Throughout the remainder of the 1900s, a lack of financial clout meant that successive managers William Lewis, Dick Molyneux and William Brown were unable to produce better than mid-table finishes in the First Division. Manager Molyneux changed Brentford's colours in 1903 to dark blue and gold stripes, the racing colours of Walter Rothschild, a patron of the club. Brentford moved to Griffin Park, its first permanent home, in time for the beginning of the 1904‚Äì05 season. The Bees reached the FA Cup first round proper for the first time in 1905‚Äì06, advancing to the third round before succumbing to Liverpool at Anfield. Despite 18 goals from Geordie Reid, Brentford finished bottom of the First Division in 1908‚Äì09, but were spared relegation. Winning the Southern Professional Charity Cup proved to be a scant consolation for secretary-manager Fred Halliday in his first season in charge. In April 1909, hopes about the possibility of the club being elected into the Football League were quashed, when the league's clubs voted down Queens Park Rangers' proposal that the Southern League First Division be merged with the Football League, to create a Third Division. Also in 1909, Brentford's colours were changed to gold shirts with blue sleeves. Manager Fred Halliday lasted in the job until November 1912, when he reverted to his secretarial duties and captain Dusty Rhodes was installed as player-manager. Despite an initial upturn in form, 9 defeats in the final 11 matches of 1912‚Äì13 led to Brentford's relegation after an 11-season stay in the First Division. = Back in the Second Division (1913‚Äì1915) = Dusty Rhodes was reappointed as player/manager for the 1913‚Äì14 Southern League Second Division season and the majority of the professionals from the previous season were sold or released. Despite a shortage of money due to high expenses (which was offset by the club's lowest-ever professional wage bill of ¬£1,630, equivalent to ¬£ in ), Brentford managed a 3rd-place finish. The Bees had their travelling subsidy from the Southern League cut for the 1914‚Äì15 season, plus the future looked bleak with the prospect of reduced attendances at Griffin Park, due to many of the clubs in the Second Division being located in the Midlands, the North West and Wales. On 4 August 1914, Britain's declaration of war on Germany threatened to derail the club's pre-season preparations and as the season got underway, the squad was weakened by the departure of players to fight or work in the munitions industry. By March 1915, only Ted Price, Dusty Rhodes and Alec Barclay remained of the XI which began the season. By utilising amateurs and guests, the Bees managed a mid-table finish. In July 1915, the Southern League cancelled its competition for the duration of the First World War.  First World War  Brentford competed in the London Combination during the First World War under secretary-manager Fred Halliday, finishing in the lower reaches of the division during the 1915‚Äì16, 1916‚Äì17 and 1917‚Äì18 seasons. The squad was decimated by the call-up of players for service or war work, though Ted Price, Dusty Rhodes, Henry White, Alf Amos and Patsy Hendren were able to remain and play in the majority of the club's matches. There was a high turnover of personnel, with 42 players being used during the 1915‚Äì16 season and 58 during 1917‚Äì18. During this period, the club wore dark blue shirts with gold collars. With the Hundred Days Offensive underway in France as the 1918‚Äì19 season kicked off, the sense of optimism that the First World War would soon end rubbed off on the Bs. 26 goals from Henry White, 25 from guest Jack Cock and 14 from Fred Morley saw Brentford win the London Combination title, four points ahead of nearest challengers Arsenal. After the Armistice, the ¬£2-a-week wages (plus expenses) for the professional players meant that Brentford finished the season with a ¬£2,000 profit, which went towards improving Griffin Park and settling debts. Outside left Patsy Hendren represented England in a Victory International versus Wales in October 1919.  Entry into the Football League  = Final Southern League season (1919‚Äì1920) = Brentford turned down the opportunity to apply for election to the Football League for the 1919‚Äì20 season and instead applied for election to the First Division of the Southern League, which was awarded. Playing in its first season at the summit of the Southern League for the first time since 1912‚Äì13, secretary-manager Fred Halliday signed almost an entirely new squad, with Patsy Hendren and Ted Price the only survivors from that pre-war season. Henry White left the club in favour of league football with Arsenal and the loss of his goals lead to a 15th-place finish. = Early Football League seasons (1920‚Äì1926) = In May 1920, Brentford and 20 other Southern League First Division clubs were elected into the Football League as founder members of the Third Division for the 1920‚Äì21 season. The club's colours were changed to white shirts and black shorts. 11 new players were signed and the Bees' first-ever Football League match took place on 28 August 1920 at Exeter City's St James Park, which resulted in a 3‚Äì0 defeat. Despite 18 goals from Harry King, a lack of goals from elsewhere in the side led Brentford to a 21st-place finish, but the club were re-elected into the league without going to a poll. Archie Mitchell took over as player-manager during the 1921 off-season and buoyed by Harry Morris' 17 goals, Brentford finished 9th in 1921‚Äì22, but it proved to be a false dawn, with the triple-departure of Alf Amos, Harry Anstiss and George Pither to Millwall in 1922 and Morris' and captain Bertie Rosier's subsequent departures in February 1923 precipitating two mid-table finishes. A dire opening to the 1924‚Äì25 season led Mitchell to step down in December 1924, with Fred Halliday assuming the manager's job for the third and final time and being forced to sue for re-election at the end of the season. Halliday remained in charge for 1925‚Äì26, which despite an 18th-place finish and a club-record 94 league goals conceded, promised much for the future with the breakthrough of forwards Ernie Watkins, Jack Lane and Alfred Douglas. In 1925, Brentford's white shirts were changed to the traditional red and white stripes.  \\"The Guv'nor\\"  Harry Curtis, known as \\"The Guv'nor\\", Brentford's longest-serving and most successful manager. = Building a team (1926‚Äì1932) = It was all change at Griffin Park during the 1926 off-season, with former Gillingham boss Harry Curtis being installed as manager. Just 9 members of the previous season's squad were retained, but despite mid-table finishes over the following three seasons, Curtis slowly rebuilt the squad with successful full back acquisitions William Hodge, Alexander Stevenson, half backs Jimmy Bain, Reginald Davies and forwards Bill Berry and Jack Phillips. The 1929‚Äì30 Third Division South season provided the foundation for the Bees' future success, with the club's unbeaten home record of 21 wins setting a national record which still stands today. Important future signings were made, including outside right Jackie Foster, centre forward Billy Lane, left back Tom Adamson and a masterstroke, local non-league centre half Joe James, who would go on to become one of the club's greatest midfielders. Though Brentford won a club- record 28 league matches, failure to mirror that form away from Griffin Park denied the club promotion to the Second Division after finishing as runners-up to Plymouth Argyle. Third and fifth-place finishes followed in the 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 seasons respectively, despite the sales of key forwards Jack Lane and Billy Lane, but a sound investment was made in inside forward George Robson, and the acquisition of England amateur international left half Jackie Burns proved to be a coup. = Promotion to the Second Division and beyond (1932‚Äì1935) = Curtis made a string of transfers in 1932 which would put Brentford on a firmly upward trajectory ‚Äì Jack Holliday, Billy Scott, Ernest Muttitt, new captain Herbert Watson (all from Middlesbrough), Idris Hopkins (Crystal Palace) and an important signing for the future, Albion Rovers' Duncan McKenzie. The Bees romped to the 1932‚Äì33 Third Division South title, with Jack Holliday scoring a club-record 39 goals, which included five hat- tricks. The team acquitted themselves well in the Second Division, strengthened with the purchase of forward Charlie Fletcher and later in the season, full back Arthur Bateman. Brentford held the second promotion place throughout February and March 1934, before a late charge by Preston North End saw the Lilywhites pip the Bees to promotion. All but one of the team's 1933‚Äì34 goals were scored by the forward line, prompting Curtis to conduct a clearout of his backlines, releasing ageing Tom Adamson, Jimmy Bain, Alexander Stevenson and both first team goalkeepers. Among Curtis' 1934 off-season signings came goalkeeper James Mathieson and full back George Poyser, plus Jimmy Bain took over as assistant manager. The goals of the 'Big Five' forward line (Scott, Holliday, Muttitt, Fletcher and Hopkins) kept Brentford in the Second Division promotion places throughout the majority of 1934‚Äì35 and after topping the table for the third time in the season on 2 March 1935, the Bees would not again relinquish top spot, cruising to the title and promotion to the First Division for the first time in the club's history. Brentford also completed a unique double by winning the London Challenge Cup. = First Division heyday (1935‚Äì1939) = After having risen from the third-tier to the first in the space of just three seasons, manager Harry Curtis elected to keep his squad intact for the 1935‚Äì36 First Division season. An extension to the New Road terrace increased Griffin Park's capacity to 40,000, which would generate extra income. After 15 matches, Brentford looked certainties to be relegated, but the purchases of half back Dai Richards and forwards David McCulloch and Bobby Reid in mid-season helped complete a remarkable turnaround, with the Bees showing the best form in all four divisions, losing just two of the final 23 matches and finishing in the club's all-time-highest position of 5th. Brentford again performed above expectations during the 1936‚Äì37 and 1937‚Äì38 seasons, finishing 6th in each campaign and reaching the FA Cup sixth round for the first time in the latter. The club reached its zenith between October 1937 and February 1938, holding onto top spot in the First Division for 17 consecutive matches. The achievements of the Bees players in the top-flight did not go unnoticed amongst the international selectors, with Duncan McKenzie and Bobby Reid (Scotland) joining previously- capped players David McCulloch (Scotland) and Idris Hopkins and Dai Richards (Wales) in the international ranks. In October 1936, Billy Scott became Brentford's first full England international. The 1938‚Äì39 season was the beginning of the end of Brentford's peak. Time had caught up on stalwarts Scott, Muttitt, Holliday and Bateman and the club's lower status led to the sales of McKenzie, McCulloch, Eastham, Reid and McAloon. Though over ¬£31,000 was banked (equivalent to ¬£ in ), little over half of it was spent principally on three players ‚Äì Republic of Ireland international full back Bill Gorman and forwards Les Boulter and Tommy Cheetham. Six wins from 10 games from February through April 1939 pulled Brentford clear of relegation. Late in the season, young homegrown forward Les Smith became the second Brentford player to win a full England cap and Les Boulter scored on his only appearance for Wales.  Second World War  Despite the spectre of war hanging over Griffin Park in August 1939, preparations for the 1939‚Äì40 season continued as normal, with Harry Curtis' only significant signing being new captain Tom Manley. The season lasted just three matches before Britain's declaration of war on Germany brought about the suspension of competitive football for the duration of the Second World War. Brentford competed in the Football League South and the London War League during the war years, with much of the team supplemented by guests and young amateurs, though the core of the pre-war team continued to play in the majority of the club's matches. Guest forwards Douglas Hunt and Eddie Perry led Brentford's forward line throughout much of the war. Brentford's most memorable wartime moment came on 30 May 1942, when two Les Smith goals gave the Bees a 2‚Äì0 victory over Portsmouth in the London War Cup final at Wembley Stadium. During 1945‚Äì46, the final season of wartime football, Brentford reached the sixth round of the FA Cup for the second time in club history and at the end of the season. Idris Hopkins (Wales), Les Smith (England) and goalkeeper Joe Crozier (Scotland) all won wartime international caps.  Decline  = Relegation and Harry Curtis' final years (1946‚Äì1949) = Brentford's 1946‚Äì47 squad, for the first competitive season after the Second World War, was propped up by the ageing core of the 1939‚Äì40 pre-war squad, though Jack Holliday, Joe James (both retired), Les Smith, Tommy Cheetham and George Poyser had by then left the club and free-scoring Bob Thomas could not be convinced to remain. The forward line was further weakened by the departures of Fred Durrant, Gerry McAloon (who had only re-signed for the club in December 1945) and George Wilkins during the season. Three new Scottish mid-season signings strengthened the back lines (Archie Macaulay, George Paterson and Malky MacDonald), but the slump failed to be arrested and the Bees crashed out of the First Division. After narrowly avoiding a second successive relegation in 1947‚Äì48, manager Harry Curtis announced that the 1948‚Äì49 season would be his last in the job, possibly due to pressure from the Brentford directors to stand down and his excellent relationship with chairman Louis P. Simon had ended after Simon's death in November 1943. Curtis' long- time trainer Bob Kane also elected to retire and was replaced by Jimmy Hogan. Jackie Gibbons was installed as player-manager in February 1949, which brought an end to Curtis' reign of nearly 23 years. Curtis remained at the club until the end of the 1948‚Äì49 season in an advisory capacity to Gibbons. The season ended with a poor 18th-place finish, though notably the FA Cup sixth round fixture at home to Leicester City set a new club-record attendance of 38,678. = Financial struggles and another relegation (1949‚Äì1954) = Despite consecutive 9th-place finishes in the 1949‚Äì50 and 1950‚Äì51 seasons and one place lower in 1951‚Äì52, secretary-manager Jackie Gibbons had worked wonders with little money with which to buy players. Low-cost acquisitions Ken Coote, George Bristow, Ian Dargie, Billy Dare and Ken Horne would each go on to make over 200 appearances for the club. The team's lack of firepower during Gibbons' three full seasons as manager was exemplified by the fact that full back and part-time forward Fred Monk was one of only three players to finish a season with a goal tally in double figures. Gibbons resigned on the eve of the 1952‚Äì53 season and long-serving assistant Jimmy Bain took over as interim manager. Brentford flirted with the relegation places, before Tommy Lawton was appointed player-manager on 2 January 1953. Lawton guided Brentford to a 17th- place finish, but after just one victory from the opening six matches of the 1953‚Äì54 season, he tendered his resignation and transferred to Arsenal two weeks later. Player Fred Monk took caretaker charge, before Bill Dodgin Sr. was appointed on 1 October 1953. By then the damage had already been done and despite the signing of future star Johnny Rainford, Brentford's relegation to the Third Division South was confirmed on the final day of the season after a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Leicester City at Griffin Park.

Hawking newspapers and working as vendors were common part time professions for young boxers, and a frequent trade of American boxers in the early twentieth century. At 19, he started boxing as an amateur in tournaments representing his school, the University of Visayas, to supplement the paltry living he made as a vendor. By the time he turned twenty in 1963, he was clearly competing as a professional. Between August 1962 and July 1965 he fought mostly in Cebu, Philippines, his hometown, or occasionally on the Philippine's big island, Luzon.

She was a speaker at the 1990 International Congress of Mathematicians, on decomposition into distinguished subspaces of certain spaces of square-integral automorphic forms.

She was the chief editor of the Journal of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu from 2002 to 2006. She became a member of the Academia Europaea in 2019.  Mathematical contributions  She has done work both in the pure representation theory of Lie groups real or p-adic (the study of unitary representations of those groups) and in the study of the \\"automorphic spectrum\\" of arithmetic groups (the study of those unitary representations which have an arithmetic significance), especially in the area of the Langlands programme. A prominent example of her achievements in the former is her classification, obtained with Jean-Loup Waldspurger, of the non- cuspidal discrete factors in the decomposition into irreducible components of the spaces of square-integrable invariant functions on adelic general linear groups. For this purpose it was first necessary to write down in a rigorous form the general theory of Eisenstein series laid down years earlier by Langlands, which they did in a seminar in Paris the content of which was later published in book form. Another notable work in the domain, with Waldspurger and Marie-France Vign√©ras, is a book on the Howe correspondence. With Waldspurger, Moeglin completed the proof of the local Gan‚ÄìGross‚ÄìPrasad conjecture for generic L-packets of representations of orthogonal groups in 2012.

Sharma and his team spent close to three years researching how to purify and repurpose carbon soot from auto and factory emissions, a major contributor to air pollution and global carbon footprint. In 2013, the Fluid Interfaces research group, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology demonstrated the process of converting carbon residue into ink for use in an inkjet cartridge. In 2016, AIR-INK products were given to graphic artists in Hong Kong, which is known for its high air pollution, who were requested to paint murals. An artist, who participated in this campaign, said of the product, \\"genius, and deserves a chance.\\" Technology Soot composed of 2.5-micrometer black carbon particles found in petrol or diesel carbon emissions is captured from the tailpipes of cars and diesel generators through a device called 'Kaalink.' A separate ensures that carbon particulate is recycled into safe inks without heavy metals/toxins A single Air Ink pen contains 30‚Äì50 minutes of air pollution. The emissions from 2,500 hours of driving one standard diesel vehicle produces about 150 litres of ink. ='Kaalink'= Kaalink is a cylindrical device that is retrofitted into a diesel generators' exhaust system or exhaust pipe to collect the emissions. It can collect up to 93% of the total exhaust, which is then processed to remove heavy metals and carcinogens. The end-product from this device is a purified carbon-based pigment. Kaalink has been tested on cars, trucks, motorcycles and fishing boats in Bangalore and Hong Kong. The company now has started to work on capturing pollution from static sources of emission such as diesel generators. Third party polluters also send in their PM2.5 pollution to Graviky's recycling warehouses. Some critics have proposed this device will act similar to a Diesel Particulate Filter, which has been shown to increase back pressure on the engine, thereby marginally affecting the efficiency of the engine, resulting in a loss of power, decreased mileage, and increased CO2 emissions.

It is also known as The Glad. Built on the site of a Victorian pub, the current building was constructed in the 1920s. It has been threatened by redevelopment but its popularity as a meeting place and live music venue have caused it to be recognised as an asset of community value. History The pub sign There has been a public house here since the 19th century and, after Charles Dickens lodged in the street, he subsequently referred to it in The Pickwick Papers. The current structure was rebuilt in the interwar period of the 20th century. It is named after William Ewart Gladstone who was prime minister four times in the 19th century. In addition to its traditional drinking clientele, it attracts young, creative types and gays. Music It is used as a live music venue and has its own record label. The type of music includes folk, blues and rock. Acts who have performed there include Ellie Goulding and Noah and the Whale. The pub is small and intimate and so does not have a stage or elaborate sound system but it is popular and crowded on music nights. Closure and re-opening In 2015, the pub was threatened by demolition and redevelopment as a 10-storey block of flats but the planning application was refused after a campaign by the Walworth Society to save it. The building was not listed by Historic England but it was recognised as an asset of community value. The tenancy has been revived since December 2016. Local MP Neil Coyle joined the Campaign for Real Ale in a pub crawl to save this and other local pubs and has been successful. The pub was inactive and boarded up for a period (between November 2016 to April 2017) after the building's owner demanded a rent hike of ¬£30k forcing the previous management to close the business. New managers Megha Khanna, Abhinav Saxena and Gaurav Khanna took over the lease in April 2017.

It was founded in 2005 as a spin-off of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH). HeiQ produces and sells textile finishing and other auxiliaries. But its core business activity is to conduct co-joint research and development projects with consumer textile products brands such as those that produce and market apparels (e.g. Patagonia, Mammut, Hanes) and home furnishings (e.g. Bekeart, IKEA) or textile producers for textile finishing to achieve effects that are currently not in market or not optimized to certain products. For the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that began in April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, HeiQ, TWE Group and Beyond Surface Technologies jointly developed an oil-absorbing, water- repelling, nonwoven fabric, in the name Oilguard for oil relief efforts. The product was intended for beach protection against oil spills and was applied to the shoreline. This allows for the fabric to absorb crude oil while repelling the seawater. This innovation was rewarded the Swiss Technology Award (2010) and the Swiss Award (2013). The water-repelling property of Oilguard is achieved with a textile finishing that creates the Lotus Effect on the surface of the non-woven fabric. The non-fluorinated finishing makes the fabric only water repellent but not oil repellent, therefore the fabric absorbs oil crudes but not the seawater.

Bracco was born to modest farmers and tilled in the fields while also attending Masses on a frequent basis. Bracco was beatified in 1998 on the occasion of Pope John Paul II's visit to Turin. Her beatification was approved after it was proven that she was killed in the defense of remaining a Christian virgin. Life Teresa Bracco was born in Dego ‚Äì in Savona ‚Äì in 1924 as the sixth of seven children to farmers Giacomo Bracco and Anna Pera. Her two brothers died within a week of each other. Her siblings were: * Giovanni ‚Äì died in 1927 from typhus * Luigi ‚Äì died in 1927 from typhus * Giuseppina * Maria * Adele * Anna ‚Äì born in 1928 The birth of her sister Anna was one of profound happiness for her parents though her father would have preferred a male in order to take possession of the farm when he was older. Bracco received her baptism in 1924 and had been named in honor of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux. In the evenings her father presided over the recitation of rosaries. Bracco often recited several rosaries as she did her chores around the house. Father Natale Olivieri came to her hometown of Santa Giulia in 1930 and was impressed with Bracco; he instructed her in catechism and also provided her with a range of religious texts for her to broaden her faith and her knowledge. She made her First Communion in the spring of 1931 and received her Confirmation on 2 October 1933. Bracco often stared at the Eucharist in times of Eucharistic Adoration ‚Äì or in the tabernacle ‚Äì in deep contemplation in order to draw strength from it. To that end she often rose in the mornings to walk over a kilometer in order to attend Mass. In 1933 she saw an image of Saint Dominic Savio in the \\"Bollettino Salesiano\\" with the late saint's motto: \\"Death rather than sin\\" and upon seeing it she exclaimed: \\"That applies to me too!\\" She cut out the image and then pasted it onto a card before hanging it over her bed ‚Äì it remained a prized possession. She then began to read about his life and also liked to read the \\"External Maxims\\" that Saint Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori published and those of Saint Vincenzo Strambi. She also cultivated devotions to Saint Agnes of Rome and her town's patron Saint Julia of Corscia as well as Saint Cecilia and Saint Lucia. In her adolescence she was noted for her modest speech and for her modest dress and was known to be timid and meek. Bracco disliked makeup though her attractiveness to men in her town saw them seek to walk with her in the fields or to Mass ‚Äì she allowed this as a favor to them though remained reserved and modest in both action and thought. Her example became known when Father Olivieri often said: \\"Be like Teresa!\\" In Lent 1940 she meditated on the two themes of life and death after two Passionist priests preached on the topics. Her father died on 13 May 1944. On 28 August 1944 she attended morning Mass at 7:00am and then went to work in the fields with her two sisters Anna and Adele when the three heard gunshots all of a sudden. At 9:00am partisans on the run warned them not to return to their home because the German soldiers were fast approaching and would pose a significant danger to the women though she wanted to return to help her mother hide and to take several possessions with her including a photograph of her late father. The Nazi soldiers who had pushed back partisans entered her hometown of Santa Giulia and began to terrorize the residences while parading the partisans as their prisoners. At 3:00pm the soldiers arrived and she hid behind a rock though was soon discovered. The Nazis kidnapped several other women in addition to Bracco. In the procession of those taken prisoner she met her cousin Enrichetta Ferrera and her infant ‚Äì Ferrera gave her child to Bracco for a brief moment but Bracco handed the child back when it began to wail and anger the soldiers. One soldier took her into the woods to rape her and she tried in vain to run to find help though was caught. The angered soldier strangled her ‚Äì despite her best efforts to resist ‚Äì and then shot her twice in the heart. He then stomped on her skull. Father Natele searched the woods and discovered her remains on 30 August alongside Bracco's sister. It was found that the murdered Bracco was on her back with her hands crossed over her chest ‚Äì a bullet went through one hand and was lodged in her upper chest and there was a pale mark on her throat in addition to bruises on her face and bite marks across her arms and chest. Olivieri hurried to cover her remains and Doctor Scorza was summoned to confirm the death and examine what had occurred. Her funeral was celebrated on 31 August. Her remains were exhumed on 10 May 1989 for canonical inspection as part of the beatification process that had been initiated. Beatification The beatification process commenced on 15 April 1988 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause and titled her a Servant of God as the first stage in the process. Bishop Livio Maritano inaugurated the diocesan process on 20 June 1988 and later closed it not long after before the C.C.S. validated it ‚Äì on 25 January 1991 ‚Äì in Rome. The official dossier known as the Positio was sent to the C.C.S. in 1993 and the theologians advising the latter approved the cause on 26 November 1996 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. also approved the cause's merits on 15 April 1997. John Paul II issued his final approval on 7 July 1997 in a decree and on his pastoral visit to Turin beatified her on 24 May 1998.

Johnston first met Trump as a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer in June 1988 and likened him to P. T. Barnum. He subsequently reported on Trump for almost 30 years, and wrote the book in 27 days. In an interview with The New York Times Johnston said that Trump had \\"...seriously damaged his brand\\" with his presidential campaign and would \\"follow him for the rest of his life\\". Johnston also felt that Trump was \\"masterful at understanding the conventions of journalism\\" and \\"remarkably agile at doing as he chooses and getting away with it\\". The book entered the New York Times hardcover nonfiction list in fifteenth position Description The book consists of 24 chapters, with an introduction and an epilogue. The book details Trump's family history, personal biography and an account of his business career and marriages. Reception David M. Shribman, writing for The Boston Globe, felt that the book was \\"a chronicle of mobsters and mistresses, shady construction deals and financial shenanigans, monumental projects and miserable (and possibly illegal) business practices\\" and that \\"Much of this slender volume's contents are already part of the public record; some of it is new\\". Shribman noted that the book focuses on Trump's personal and business life rather than his political career and that \\"More than a dozen Republican candidates and the entire Democratic Party have made the very same argument Johnston puts forward here. It is an important critique, yet an ignored one. Trump may, and probably does, have all these flaws. He also possesses perhaps the most important, and in some quarters surely the most appealing, message in this year of fear and discontent. The book that explains that is the one worth writing, and waiting for\\". The book was reviewed by Michael Russell for the Herald Scotland who wrote that the \\"24 short chapters of the very readable book contain substantial detail regarding Trump's activities since that time. They also dig into his earlier years and some of his family background. As to the truth of these claims, readers will need to make up their own minds\\". Russell felt that Johnston \\"sometimes comes across as being almost as self-satisfied and assertive as Trump\\" but concluded that \\"Inauguration, unlike baptism, does not wash away sins nor confer wisdom. If even a 10th of David Cay Johnston‚Äôs stories are true, then Trump is morally, intellectually, culturally, economically, legally and politically unfit for office of any sort. No wonder so much of the world is shaking its head but also holding its breath\\". David J. Lynch reviewed the book for The Financial Times and wrote that \\"Johnston has done voters a service with this unblinking portrait. He makes a compelling case that Trump has the attributes of both \\"dictator\\" and \\"deceiver\\" and would be a disaster in the Oval Office. ...Yet, ultimately this is a dispiriting read. If Johnston's rendering of Trump is at all accurate, it is not just the New York businessman who deserves rebuke. So too does an entire American political system that has put him within reach of the White House despite his manifest flaws.\\" Lynch was also critical of Johnston's prose style, feeling that \\"This slim 210-page volume feels a bit rushed: the transitions can be choppy and, like his subject, Johnston has a healthy regard for his own abilities. ...Tip: when you are taking down one of the world‚Äôs great narcissists, go easy on self-promotion\\" but that it \\"is a minor flaw in a work that delivers so much insight\\".

Location Dunmoe Castle is located on the northwest bank of the Boyne, northeast of Navan. History The placename is probably derived from Irish D√∫n mB√≥, \\"hillfort of cattle,\\" suggesting that a Gaelic Irish fort was on this site before the later castle. The castle was built for the D'Arcy family in the mid-15th century and marked the western edge of The Pale. According to the Civil Survey (1654‚Äì6) Thomas Darcy owned the entire parish and on the premises there was ‚Äòa Castle, a Church, a Mill, an Orchard and a fishing weare‚Äô. During the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649 the Castle was fired upon from the south bank by passing troops on their way from Drogheda to Athboy, but avoided any real damage. According to legend, the occupant, George d'Arcy, entertained King James on the night before the Battle of the Boyne (1690) and King William the day after, inspiring the couplet: \\"Who will be king, I do not know, But I'll be d'Arcy of Dunmoe.\\" The two- storey building attached to the east may be an 18th-century addition. A drawing of 1795 shows the castle intact. It was burned down during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Now only the two southern towers and some walls remain. Building The castle is an Anglo-Norman donjon (keep). It was originally a rectangle (15 √ó 10 m, 16 √ó 11 yds) with a tower at each corner. Two of these towers have crumbled, as has the entire back part of the castle. The ground floor is buried but was vaulted and had a loft and arrowslits on the south wall. The newel stairs in the southwest tower have a gun loop. A nearby chapel contains the tombs of the D'Arcys.

It dates back to the 13th century, although most of the structure dates from the 15th century, and there have been various changes since then. Location Iddesleigh, known as leddeslegh before the Norman conquest of England (1066), is a village and parish in Devonshire. Samuel Lewis described the parish in 1848 as follows, Iddesleigh today is a small village with a few thatched cottages and houses. From the church there are excellent views over Dartmoor, including Cawsand Beacon, Yes Tor and High Willhays. History At one time the manor belonged to the De Sullys, one of whom was a famous crusader. Later it passed to Sir John Leger, and later to Sir Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh (1818‚Äì87). The parish church has its origins in the 13th century, but mostly dates to the 15th century. The parish registers start in 1541. 92 adult males in leddeslegh parish signed the Protestation Returns of 1641‚Äì1642, in which they swore an oath of allegiance to the Protestant religion. This indicates the population at that time. The church was partially rebuilt in 1720. It was repaired and partially rebuilt in 1848. The vestry is an 1850 addition to the west end of the north aise. Memorial windows were added in 1866 to Hugh Malet, of Ash, and to Maria Louisa Prior: The church was thoroughly restored in 1879. Another memorial window was added by subscription to the 1st Earl of Iddesleigh, who died in 1887. A new organ was installed in 1897. The reredos and south chancel window were presented in 1912. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 22 February 1967. Building The church of St. James is in the Gothic style. The walls are of coursed slate stone rubble with some granite ashlar in the buttresses of the tower. The roof is gable ended, covered in slate with decorative ridge tiles from the late 19th century. There is a four-stage tower with battlements at the western end with angle buttresses, with a crouching animal gargoyle on top of each buttress. The tower holds six bells. The first two are dated 1620 and the third is dated 1629. The tenor bell has an inscription in old English characters dedicating it to St. George. In 1911 two new bells were added to commemorate the coronation of King George V. The church has a chancel, nave, aisles and south porch, and can seat 120 people. The interior is a tall granite arcade with three bays. It has piers with moulded cup capitals and 4-centred moulded arches. The nave and north aisle have excellent barrel vault ceilings. These are original, and have high relief moulding. There is a section of 15th century screen with perpendicular tracery in the north chapel, which was renovated in 1883. The semi-octagonal panelled pulpit is early 17th century, with an integral carved lectern. The font is octagonal, of granite with carved panels and a moulded shaft, and may date to 1538. The north wall of the chancel holds a slate memorial dated 1681 to Wilmot Veale, wife of the rector. The inscription is in gothic script, and the memorial has a high relief carved figure of a woman and child. The church holds a fairly well-preserved effigy of a military figure almost long from about 1250. It is held under a low arch in the north wall of the north aisle, behind the organ. The figure is recumbent, with crossed legs. The head is on a rectangular pillow and the feet rest on a lion. The figure is dressed in mail under a surcoat which falls open at the front. The knight wore a sword and a shield with no heraldry. Possibly the effigy represents an ancestor of Sir John Sully, a crusader who owned property at Iddesleigh, where he died in 1387 at the age of 105. Organisation St James, Iddesleigh is in the parish of Iddesleigh in the Diocese of Exeter of the Church of England. The church seems to have originally been named after Saint James the Less, but later was seen as named after James the Great. None of the six stores in the church were dedicated to James. In 1740 the parish feast was reported as being held on Whit Tuesday, but around 1755 it was reported on Whit Sunday. The Friends Of St James, Iddesleigh, is a registered charity that supports the St James parochial council in fundraising and in maintaining the church. It makes grants to organisations for conserving the environment and heritage, and for activities related to religion, art, culture, heritage and science.

In 2014 Night Dive Studios re-released the iOS, Linux and Steam versions. This is the last game to feature Jason Ellefson as the voice of Putt-Putt.  Production  Concept art for Merlin the Medieval Sorcerer, a new character in the game Putt Putt Travels Through Time. Artists played around with designs and colours until settling on the finished version as he appears in the game (bottom). The production team brainstormed ideas for the follow-up title in the Putt Putt franchise. Among the alternate titles were: Putt-Putt Goes to the Carnival, Putt-Putt Saves the Universe, and Putt- Putt Learns to Fly. They eventually settled on Putt-Putt Travels Through Time. While the designs of the main characters were already established, the team had to work on designing to look of new characters such as Merlin the Medieval Sorcerer. Next, the scripts was written and storyboards were created to layout how each scene would work as a self-contained piece, as well as part of a larger story. Background artists then interpreted both the script and storyboards to create the look and feel of the game through the backgrounds; part of their job was to leave sufficient space for clickable hotspots. Once the basic design sketch was approved, it was given more detail and finally painted. Next, animators created series of drawings based on the storyboards which when viewed together would simulate movement; each of the 30,000 drawings were then individually scanned into a computer, where they were cleaned up and had imperfections removed. The next stage was for artists to colour frames and animate clickpoints; Humongous noted that while this stage was \\"tedious\\", it allowed low-level artists to be creative and use their initiative. Next, the work was handed over to programmers who wrote code to ensure the game responded to player choices, and who added sound effects to synch up to the animations. The music was created by Humongous, while voice actors were auditioned by the company (if new to the franchise), then sent to a studio to record their lines. Putt Putt game designer Nick Mirkovich commented that there was a design philosophy of creating immersive interactive world for players to explore, and that like other games by Humongus, items needed for game completion were programmed to be in different places for separate playthroughs. Players could go behind the scenes into the game's production via the company website. Plot The game begins with Putt-Putt packing his new school supplies. Putt-Putt is excited to show Mr. Firebird his history report, calculator, and Smokey the Fire Engine lunchbox before school starts. He wakes up Pep, brings his coin, and heads down the road to Mr. Firebird's Lab. He explains about his new Time Portal invention, which allows the past and future to be seen without actually traveling there. After Putt- Putt takes out his things, Mr. Firebird attempts to start the machine. After failing, he realizes he needs a coin to start the machine, and he is fresh out. Putt-Putt offers the coin, and Mr. Firebird starts the machine. However, the Time Portal goes haywire (out of control) and opens up. It sucks Putt- Putt's objects and Pep into time. A panicked Mr. Firebird tells Putt-Putt of the risk of being sucked into time unless the portal is shut closed for sure. Putt-Putt assures him that he will gather his things and Pep soon, and enters the Time Portal. Putt-Putt must retrieve his lost things and Pep in order for Mr. Firebird to close the portal for good. Putt-Putt returns to the present with his things and Pep, and Mr. Firebird closes the portal for good. Putt- Putt tells Mr. Firebird that he liked time traveling and that it was the best fun ever. Mr. Firebird is glad that Putt-Putt had fun while time traveling, but then tells Putt-Putt that he's going to be late for school unless he hurries. Putt-Putt tells him that he's right, and he will show him his school supplies later. At school, Putt-Putt shares the news by telling everyone about time traveling as the game ends. Gameplay The game mechanics are the same as the prequels including the glove box inventory, horn, radio and accelerator. There are also a number of optional minigames throughout the four eras. Reception Computer Shopper felt the game was fun, but ultimately failed to live up to predecessors of the genre. [null The Cincinnati Post] deemed the game \\"outstanding\\", and recommended that younger children purchase an earlier title in the Putt Putt series first to acquaint themselves with computers before attempting this more \\"challenging\\" title. The Boston Herald gave the game a rating of 4.5 stars, praising the abundance of clickakle hotspots in every scene which would keep kids entertained while completing the adventure. The newspaper also deemed the game one of the \\"finest kid titles ever\\". [null Rocky Mountain News] gave it a B, commenting that it lived up to the quality standard of Humongus Entertainment. The Washington Times wrote that the game was \\"delightful\\" and \\"uncomplicated\\". In the Fourth Quarter 1997, the game was the 4th biggest seller in the PC Kids/Edutainment category.

Early life and education Helen Brotherton was born at Harscott in Lincolnshire, and raised at Leamington Spa, the daughter of Eric and Helen Jakeman Brotherton. She trained as a teacher at Roehampton.Michael J.

Brownsea Island Sign Career Her first teaching job was at Norwich High School for Girls. During World War II, she joined the Women's Voluntary Service, and eventually ran the Sick Bays in Warwickshire, for which she received the British Empire Medal in 1943. She moved to Poole, Dorset, after the war, to care for her aging mother. An avid birdwatcher, she volunteered with the Dorset Field Ornithology Group, and through that group came to know the specific environmental issues in Dorset. She sailed her own boat to Brownsea Island for explorations, against the ban on public access, issued and enforced by the island's reclusive owner, Mary Bonham-Christie.Sophie Campbell, \\"The Island that was Saved by a Demon\\" Telegraph Travel (28 July 2007). In the early 1960s, after Bonham-Christie's death, Brotherton organized a group to oppose development on Brownsea Island, because the planned development would threaten a wading birds habitat. Because of her group's efforts, the National Trust took ownership of Brownsea, and the group developed into the Dorset Wildlife Trust.Hester Lacey, \\"Brownsea-Dorset Island Life\\" Kent Life (19 February 2010), Retrieved 24 August 2016 Helen Brotherton was the Trust's first and longtime secretary. In 1963, she was awarded an OBE for her environmental work.Stephen Moss, \\"Obituary: Helen Brotherton\\" The Guardian (30 August 2009). Brotherton worked with the coastal protection project \\"Operation Neptune\\" as the National Trust's regional representative in Wessex. In 1984, she was appointed a CBE for this activism. She founded the Portland Bird Observatory, was a trustee of the Chesil and Fleet Trust.

It is produced by Sony Pictures Networks Productions, Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde. Anil Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Ileana D'Cruz and Athiya Shetty played the lead roles in the film. It is a story about twin brothers. The film was released worldwide on 28 July 2017 in 2350 screens in India and 475 screens overseas. Plot The story starts with a couple traveling with their twin boys in a car. The dad is exhausted and dozes off at the wheel causing an accident. The couple dies but the twins survive. The twins are sent to their uncle, Kartar Singh (Anil Kapoor). As he is a confirmed bachelor, he decides to give one son to his elder sister Arshveer \\"Jeeto\\" Kaur (Ratna Pathak) based in London and the other to his brother Baldev Singh Bajwa (Pavan Malhotra) who is settled in Punjab whilst he himself enjoys his single, lonely life in London. Years pass and both twins grow up. Karan Singh Bajwa (Arjun Kapoor) lives with his aunt Jeeto in London and Charan Singh Bajwa (Arjun Kapoor) lives with his uncle in Punjab. Karan has a girlfriend, Supreet \\"Sweety\\" Gill (Ileana D'Cruz) from the past 2 years. Karan's dad wants him to marry a girl named Binkle (Athiya Shetty) who has a rich dad. Her dad helped Karan's dad start his business. Because he wants to marry Sweety, Karan manages to convince Charan's dad to make Charan marry Binkle. Meanwhile, in Punjab, Charan also has a girlfriend, Nafisa Qureshi (Neha Sharma) who is a Muslim and studying law. But his dad is biased against Muslims. So Charan hasn't told his dad about her. Baldev takes Charan to London where Kartar welcomes them. In London, Charan tells his uncle Kartar that he doesn't want to marry Binkle and he is in love with Nafisa. His uncle suggests that he pretend to be a drug addict in front of the Sandhu family so that they will turn down the marriage proposal themselves. The next day, Charan does as planned but when he sees Binkle, he falls in love at first sight. Binkle takes Charan on a tour of the house while Kartar hints at the silly habits of Charan's drug addiction to Manpreet (Karan Kundra), Binkle's brother. Charan tries to alert Kartar to his sudden change of heart, but, in a comic twist, falls out of the window trying to get cellphone service. Due to this incident, Manpreet turns suspicious and assumes Charan to be a drug addict. This upsets Baldev and gets mad at the Sandhu family. Jeeto and Gurcharan (Lalit Parimoo), Jeeto's husband, instead of defending Baldev, persuade him to apologize Mr. Sandhu for his misbehavior but Baldev refuses to do so. They return home and blame Baldev for their disrespect in front of the wealthy Sandhu family and humiliate him. This angers Baldev and he decides to return to Punjab. He challenges Jeeto that he will marry Charan exactly on 25 December with a girl much better than Binkle. They have a huge argument and sever ties with each other. They end their relationship. Meanwhile, Charan asks Karan to bring Nafisa to the airport so that he could talk about his feelings for her with his adoptive father. When they land in Punjab, Karan does what Charan asked and confronts them with Nafisa, but Charan is terrified and doesn't dare to speak up. Baldev misunderstands that Nafisa is Karan's girlfriend. This creates a complicated situation for Karan. Baldev overhears Sweety's father pleading for her daughter's marriage soon in a Gurudwara. So, Baldev takes Charan's purposal for Sweety who misunderstands her bond getting tied with Karan but later realizes it's tied with Charan. She gets upset at Karan. While back at London, Jeeto takes a proposal for Karan to Binkle without Karan knowing. They fix their marriage on 25 December too. Kartar is split on whether to go to Jeeto or Baldev's marriage events since they are at the same date. To solve his problem, he suggests that Baldev have a destination marriage in London. Baldev agrees and everyone flies to London. Everyone goes to a mall for shopping. Charan takes advantage of this and reveals Karan and Sweety's relationship. On hearing this Binkle is heartbroken. Charan feels sorry for her and falls for her more because of her innocence towards him. Charan refuses to fight for his rights. Karan then invites Nafisa to London for Charan's engagement to Sweety increasing Charan's problems. Karan, Charan, Sweety and Nafisa decide to elope. But their plan fails when in the next morning Manpreet falls for Nafisa and Sandhu insists her to live at his residence. Nafisa and Manpreet fall for each other. Nafisa starts ignoring Charan. Charan wants to reveal his feelings for Binkle but at the moment, Nafisa appears and confess her love for Manpreet and leaves. Charan and Karan's marriages are planned at the same Gurudwara on the same date. Before Binkle's engagement, Charan confess all the mishaps and misunderstandings happened and explains that he is not a drug addict too. He also reveals his feelings to her at last. Kartar dreams of his brother, the twins' father realizing him that he left his children to him and he is ruining their life. After Binkle's engagement, Karan, Sweety, Charan, Binkle, Manpreet, Nafisa and Kartar gather at a place where Kartar declines to help them and said they would have to marry the ones chosen by their parents instead of eloping unless they did something. So, 25 December arrives when Karan and Charan exchange their sherwanis, disguising each other. At the gurudwara, Sweety reveals her love for Karan in front of everyone. This shocks everyone including Charan and Karan because of their exchanged identities. Kartar then explains to Jeeto and Baldev they are being silly and should stop arguing. They patch up. Not to cause more trouble and confusion the twins take Kartar in for a confidential meeting revealing their exchanged identities where Kartar orders them to wear their original identities and never ever discuss this mishap with their wives. So, their families no more oppose their choices and Karan weds Sweety while Charan weds Binkle.

Meena Lyer of Times of India rated the film 3/5 and concluded: \\"Anil is the scene-stealer with his half Brit-half Punjabi act lifting the film throughout. Arjun‚Äôs double-act allows for some smiles and the girls, Ileana, Athiya and Neha are easy on the eye, though they‚Äôre just decorative set-pieces.\\" Manju Ramanan of Masala! gave the film 3.5/5 saying, \\"Loud characters, bright sets, songs and dances and slapstick humour dominate this Anees Bazmee film. But the instances do make you smile. Ahana Bhattacharya of Koimoi gave the film 3/5 saying, \\"The story is funny and the film has some really hilarious dialogues. However, Sardar jokes are a bit clich√©d and Bollywood needs to get over it. I loved the way the film builds up the confusion but it tends to drag towards the climax. There are moments when you will feel it is patriarchal, racist and regressive. Also, the climax is a bit predictable.

His reign was marked by an unsuccessful Turkish attempt to expel him and by the first treaty between Crimea and the Zaporozhian Cossacks. He was driven out by the Turks in 1628 and died trying to regain his throne. His name in Crimean Tatar is (). 1584‚Äì1601 Early life His grandfather, khan Mehmed II Giray the fat, was one of the many sons of Devlet I Giray. In 1584 Mehmed II was driven from the throne and killed. A few months later Mehmed‚Äôs son Saadet II Giray invaded, made himself khan and was driven out. He fled to the Kumyks on the Caspian Sea and died in Astrakhan around 1588, allegedly poisoned by the Russians. Saadet's sons, in order by age, were Devlet, Mehmed and Shahin Giray. Around 1594, during the reign of Gazi II Giray, Mehmed arrived in Crimea along with his two brothers and mother. At some point his elder brother Devlet became nureddin. In 1601 Devlet conspired against Gazi. The plot was detected, Devlet was killed and Mehmed and Shahin fled. A few months later Gazi‚Äôs brother Selyamet came under suspicion and fled. The three went to Turkey. 1601‚Äì1608 First exile Gazi demanded Selyamet back, but the sultan exiled him to Anatolia. He and Mehmed joined the Celali rebellions. Around 1603 they and the rebels were pardoned but soon the brothers were imprisoned in Yedikule Fortress for some reason. Gazi II died in 1607 and passed the throne to his son Tokhtamysh. The Turks rejected this, released Selyamet from prison and appointed him khan. He chose Mehmed his kalga. 1608‚Äì1610 Conflict with khan Selyamet Mehmed set out overland to Crimea with a group of janissaries. On the road he met Tokhtamysh and killed him. Sel√¢met I Giray arrived by boat a little later. A few weeks later Mehmed‚Äôs brother Shahin arrived from Circassia and was made nureddin (third in rank after khan and kalga). In 1609 Mehmed and Shahin conspired against Selyamet. They were informed on by Janibek and khan Selyamet planned to kill them. The brothers also had informants and fled to the Caucasus. Janibek became kalga. The brothers gathered troops and Selyamet asked for help from the Turks. Instead of soldiers they sent a diplomat called Rizvan Pasha. Rizvan reconciled the three and the brothers were restored to their previous positions. While returning to Crimea they learned that Selyamet had died of natural causes. The brothers continued to Bakhchisarai and proclaimed themselves khan and kalga. (For whatever reason this is not included in the standard list of reigns. If it were, this would count as Mehmed's first reign in between Selyamet and Janibek's first reign.) Janibek fled to Rizvan Pasha at Kaffa. Mehmed demanded that Janibek be sent back and Rizvan refused, saying that Mehmed was not a legal khan until he was confirmed the sultan. Mehmed sent a man called Hadji-Koy to Istanbul with bribes. There he found that Janibek had already bribed the major politicians, so he transferred his bribes to the winning side. (In 1626 Mehmed caught Haji-Koy in Akkerman and hung him.) Sultan Ahmed I made Janibek khan and sent eight galleys and troops to Kaffa. Mehmed and Shahin fled to the steppes. Hearing that the Turkish troops were leaving they invaded Crimea and were soundly defeated by the remaining janissaries. They fled to Budjak. 1610‚Äì1623 Second exile Shahin remained in Budjak and became a raider until the Turks drove him out. Mehmed went to Turkey where he gained the support of a politician named Nasuh Pasha. Nasuh planned to present him to the sultan while the sultan was hunting. The story goes Gaivoronsky confines his doubts to a footnote. that during the hunt the sultan drew his bow to kill a roe deer when the deer was struck by someone else‚Äôs arrow. Mehmed followed the result of his well-aimed shot and came face to face with the sultan. Nasuh‚Äôs enemies suggested that this might have been an assassination attempt. Nasuh fell from power and was executed in 1614. Mehmed was sent to the Yedikule prison for a second time. In February 1618 Mehmed escaped, was captured on the Bulgarian coast and exiled to the isle of Rhodes where he was well-treated. Here he gained the support of a politician called Mere H√ºseyin Pasha. In February 1623, Mere Huseyin became vizier. He released Mehmed and made him khan to replace the incompetent Janibek. He arrived at Kaffa on 19 May 1623 and Janibek fled. 1623 First year of reign His first task was to deal with Khan Temir and the Budzhak Horde. Turkey and Poland had just made peace, but Khan Temir continued raiding since that was how he made his money. Mehmed led the whole Crimean army west and somehow talked Khan Temir into withdrawing east to the Syut-Su River (location?). Despite the peace the Zaporozhians raided Crimea and almost reached the capital. In revenge the Mansur bey raided Poland and took so many captives that prices on the slave market collapsed. Mehmed proved a stronger ruler than his predecessor Janibek, which caused hostility among the nobility. 1624 Attempted overthrow Huseyin Pasha lost power in August 1623. Murad IV became sultan. A eunuch named Mustafa supported Janibek against Mehmed. Sensing the change in Istanbul, the beys began complaining to the Turks. One of their complaints was that the Don Cossacks had just raided Crimea and Mehmed did not stop them. Mehmed was told to lead an army to Persia and he refused, saying that he had to defend Crimea against the Zaporozhians. In 1551 Sahib I Giray was overthrown for refusing to fight the Persians, as was Mehmed's grandfather Mehmed II Giray in 1584. In the spring of 1624 the sultan deposed Mehmed in favor of Janibek. In May 1624 Mehmed's brother Shahin Giray arrived from Persia and became kalga. The nureddin was Devlet Choban-Giray. The brothers decided to resist. Shahin had a number of beys executed while courting the common people. They began to collect troops from the Nogais, Circassians and Kumyks. A group of Zaporozhians who had been captured after their boats were washed up on shore by a storm were offered their freedom if they would fight for Mehmed. Otherwise they would be sold to the Turks as galley slaves. The beys were placed under Mehmed and their sons under Shahin. They were told that if the beys deserted to Janibek their sons would be hanged and the reverse. On 3 June Janibek landed at Kaffa with 12 galleys and found his way blocked by Shahin. When Mehmed refused to yield the Turks sent 40 more ships and janissaries under Kapudan Pasha Rejeb Pasha. Neither side chose fight and the siege dragged on. In late July 100 Cossack boats entered the Bosphoros and raided the outskirts of Istanbul. The area was almost defenseless because the main fleet was away in Crimea. The Turks assembled what boats they could and after a 3-day standoff the Zaporozhians left. From prisoners the Turks learned that the Cossacks were in contact with Mehmed. Rejeb Pasha was ordered to clean things up and bring the fleet back to Istanbul. On 11 August Rejeb Pasha marched out of Kaffa with about 10000 soldiers and the cannon he had removed from the boats and fortress walls. He marched for three days without opposition until, near Qarasuvbazar, he came to a line of earth-filled barrels that the Zaporozhians had set up. The Cossacks began firing and the Turks were cut down because they had not brought entrenching tools. Soon they were surrounded by Crimean cavalry. That night Rejeb realized his defeat and planned to recognize Mehmed as khan. Learning of this, Janibek fled. His flight provoked a rout. Abandoning their cannon, the janissaries were chased back to Kaffa. Shahin Giray burst in to Kaffa since the fort no longer had guns. Mehmed carefully held back since entering Kaffa would be an invasion of Turkish territory. Rejeb fled to a boat in the harbor and began negotiations. It was agreed that Mehmed would remain khan and that he would withdraw from Kaffa. The sultan would pretend that the Turkish invasion was unauthorized. A few weeks later a boat arrived with a decree confirming Mehmed‚Äôs title. On 5 September a festival was held at Kaffa marking Mehmed‚Äôs re-accession. He entered Kaffa not as a conqueror but as a guest. 1625‚Äì1627 Shahin and the Poles: Mehmed was careful not to antagonize the Turks unnecessarily, but his brother was more aggressive. He disliked the Turkish policy of deposing khans and the use of Crimean troops in distant Turkish wars. While still in Kaffa Shahin sent a letter to the Polish king proposing a Crimean-Polish-Zaporozhian alliance against Turkey. Apparently Crimean-Nogai raiding would be directed against Moscow. In return he asked for lead and gunpower. The Poles were noncommital. He went north to meet the Zaporozhians bearing rich gifts and the captured Cossacks who had fought for him. On 3 January 1625 Crimea and Zaporozhia made an alliance. This was apparently the first time the Cossacks had made a treaty as if they were an independent stateIn 1648 a Crimean- Cossack alliance was the basis of the Khmelnytsky Uprising. In the fall on 1625 Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski led an army to Zaporozhia. The Cossacks submitted, but remained difficult to control. In order to break Shahin‚Äôs plan, Istanbul ordered Mehmed to attack Poland. Starting in January 1626 a Crimean-Budjak army plundered some 200 villages in Volhynia and Galicia and withdrew before Koniecpolski and Stefan Chmielecki could bring up troops. Shahin not only opposed the campaign but also informed Koniecpolski. A later raid by Khan Temir and the nureddin Azamat Giray was defeated by Chmielecki and the Cossack Mykhailo Doroshenko. Khan Temir: In 1624, Khan Temir returned to Budjak when he heard of Mehmed‚Äôs deposition. He led a raid into Polish territory and was defeated by Koniecpolski. Shahin lead an army east to bring him under control. Temir‚Äôs nobles convinced him that their position was untenable, so the Budjak Horde moved back east after burning everything they could not carry. In early 1627 Mehmed led 10000 Crimeans and Budjaks east to deal with some Besleney who had stopped paying tribute. Shahin and Khan Temir stayed in Crimea. In the mountains he conversed with his Circassian father-in-law. As he left some Budjak mirzas slipped away and murdered Mehmed‚Äôs father-in-law who in 1622 had killed the uncle of Khan Temir. Mehmed assumed that this could not have happened without the consent of Khan Temir, so he sent a messenger to Shahin ordering him to be arrested. Khan Temir learned of it and fled to the steppe. Shahin rounded up Temir‚Äôs relatives and threatened to kill them if Temir did not return. He refused and the threat was carried out. The brothers had now made a dangerous enemy. Temir offered his services to the Turks. 1628 Overthrow There was now a possibility that Crimea would be attacked by Khan Temir from the land and the Turks by sea. Janibek appeared offering to lead the Crimean army to Persia if he were made khan. Mehmed offered major concessions to Istanbul, but this did not work. The Turks began supplying Khan Temir. They ordered Mehmed to attack Poland, planning to land Janibek while he was away. In March 1628 Shahin set out toward Poland while in fact planning to attack Khan Temir. He marched along the coast and through Budjak to Dobrudja with Khan Temir falling back all the way. At the village of Babadag near the Danube delta he met some Budjak troops. He attacked, the Budjaks fled and he chased them into the woods where he found himself surrounded by Khan Temir. Only Shahin and a few friends managed to break out. Shahin reached Bakhchiserai on 3 May 1628. A few days later the Budjaks burst into Crimea. Much of the Crimean army had been lost at Babadag. The mansur clan and the nureddin Azamat Giray went over to Khan Temir. The brothers with a few hundred men fled to the ancient rock-fort of Chufut-Kale. (circa 10 may) The place could not be stormed so Khan Temir settled down for a siege. Four weeks later 4000 Zaporozhian Cossacks under Mykhailo Doroshenko burst into the peninsula. At first Khan Temir thought that they were merely raiding, but he was quickly disabused. He abandoned the siege and on 31 May he was defeated on the Alma River. Doroshenko was killed, Khan Temir was wounded, Azamat Giray fled to Akkerman and the brothers left Chufut-Kale to meet their new friends. A Cossack banner was hoisted over the walls of Bakhchisarai. Mehmed spent almost three weeks gathering troops. Khan Temir fled to Kaffa. Since he had an order from the sultan telling Ottoman officials to help him, the gates of Kaffa were opened. The place soon filled with Budjak warriors, their families, yurts, carts and cattle. Mehmed besieged Kaffa. Khan Temir attacked them, was defeated and barely got back through the gates. His son was captured and was executed while Khan Temir watched from the walls. Crimean forces rounded up the Budjak warriors who had not reached Kaffa. Shahin wanted to storm the town before a Turkish fleet arrived, but Mehmed held him back, not wishing to provoke the Turks. After a delay dozens of Turkish Galleys appeared at Kaffa along with janissaries and Janibek Giray. On the morning of 30 May Mehmed awoke to find that all of his commanders had gone over to Janibek. Mehmed fled to the mountains. Shahin fled to the Cossacks. Khan Temir could not defeat the Cossacks because they knew what would happen to them if they were defeated. The Zaporozhians drew back along the Arabat Spit, reached the mainland and went to Zaporozhia. 1628‚Äì29 Third exile and death From the Dnieper Shahin began a correspondence with the Poles. He asked for 12000 Cossacks to reconquer Crimea. In return he promised that Crimean raids on Polish territory would stop. The Poles gave him much support, but kept it secret, fearing an open break with Turkey. They planned to claim that the Cossacks were acting on their own. The Cossacks were happy since recent experience made Crimea look like an easy target. About this time Mehmed appeared in the Cossack camp. He had slipped out of the mountains, crossed Crimea undetected and reached the steppe. First campaign: In early November 1628 a Rada was held. Mehmed and Shahin promised each Cossack 10 zlotys for the campaign. If successful, they promised not to ask for Polish tribute, not to attack Polish territory and to liberate any Polish or Ukrainian slaves in Crimea. An army of 6000 Cossacks and 8000 Crimeans set out. There was trouble from the start. The Cossacks did not like a winter campaign. Shahin promised each man a sheepskin coat. Many Cossacks did not like the new Hetman, Hryhoriy Chorny. After crossing the Dnieper, Shahin asked them to hurry but they would not. Around 15 November they approached Or-Kapi, but found that Janibek, his brother Devlet and Khan Temir had gotten there a few hours before. (Or Qapi was the fort that guarded Perekop.) North of Or-Kapi was a large herd of Nogai cattle. Against Shahin‚Äôs advice, the Cossacks decided to steal the cattle first. With the cattle driven to the rear they moved up to within cannon-shot of the fort and then stopped. Janibek thought they were preparing for battle but in fact they were quarrelling. The Cossacks decided to forget about Crimea and drive their valuable loot back to Zaporozhe. Shahin could not stop them. Khan Temir chased them as far as the Dnieper but accomplished nothing. Gaivoronsky, v. 2, pp. 155‚Äì158. He does not explicitly say that Mehmed was on the campaign. Second campaign: Shahin planned a new campaign in spring when the drift ice cleared from the Dnieper. Mehmed went east to bring troops from the Lesser Nogai Horde. Many Cossacks gathered, hoping for loot. By April, Janibek, Devlet and Khan Temir were guarding Or-Kapi. Hoping to get these troops away from Or- Kapi, the Cossacks sent 500 to 700 men to raid Crimea. They landed on the western coast, went through the forests and captured the ancient fort of Mangup-Kale which was weakly defended and used by the khan as a treasury. The local people drove them out. They were forced to throw away much of their loot, which enriched the local villagers. On 18 May 1629 a rada was held at Zaporozhe. Each Cossack was promised 10 zlotys and a horse. After crossing the Dnieper the army found that there was little water. In the first battle they drove Janibek‚Äôs men back to Or-Kapi at a cost of up to 1000 Cossacks. Janibek was worried because he was outnumbered, but scouts reported that there were rows of carts with barrels supplying the enemy. Khan Temir sent troops to destroy the water carts and now the allies were without water. On 30 May Khan Temir attacked. The battle was inconclusive, but toward the end of the day thirst began to take effect and many of the Cossacks wanted to go home. Mehmed now decided that he had lost. Not only that, but having twice lost, he could expect to spend the rest of his life as an unsupported exile. He slipped through the lines and told Khan Temir‚Äôs men that he would surrender in exchange for his life. He returned to camp to extricate his Crimeans from the Cossacks. As they saddled up the Cossacks realized what was happening and tried to stop them. Khan Temir exploited the situation by attacking. Mehmed told the Cossacks that the approaching force were allies that he had called in, so the Zaporozhians opened their lines. The Budjaks broke in and in the melee Mehmed was killed, pierced by a Cossack pike. Gaivoronsky, v. 2, pp. 160‚Äì168. The Cossacks fought their way back to the Dnieper, where Khan Temir abandoned the chase. They had lost one man in four. One hundred of Mehmed‚Äôs men reached Zaporozhe and were released. Janibek lost about 6000. The Cossack hetman was beheaded and his head set up at Kaffa. Shahin Giray escaped with a few men. Mehmed‚Äôs body was brought back to Crimea and buried alongside his father and grandfather. Mehmed II Giray, Saadet II Giray and Mehmed III Giray, grandfather, father and son, were all driven from the throne, all killed outside Crimea and all buried at the Aziz Malik-Ashter mausoleum in Crimea.

The text is written in vernacular English, in an East Midlands dialect that suggests either Lincoln or Beverley as its origin, although its title is given in Latin.Wickham (1976, 193). The name of its playwright is unknown. Only two scenes, with a total of 84 lines of verse in rhyming couplets, are extant and survive in a manuscript held by the British Museum, dated to either the late twelfth or very early thirteenth century.British Museum Additional MS 23986; see Wickham (1976, 193). In the nineteenth century, the manuscript belonged to the Rev. Richard Yerburgh of Sleaford, father of the conservative politician Robert Armstrong Yerburgh; see Chambers (1903, 324). Glynne Wickham provides both the original text and a rendering in modern English in his English Moral Interludes (1976).Wickham (1976, 195‚Äì203). E. K. Chambers also provided the text in his The Mediaeval Stage (1903, vol. 2, 324‚Äì326), though Wickham points out that in that book the scenes have been inaccurately transcribed; see Wickham (1979, 198). Chamber's book is . In tone and form, the interlude seems to be the closest play in English to the contemporaneous French farces, such as The Boy and the Blind Man, and is related to later English farcical plays, such as the anonymous Calisto and Melibea (published c. 1525) and John Heywood's The Foure PP (c. 1530).Axton (1979, 15), Bevington (1962, 9; 11; 38; 45), Meredith (1998, 699), and Wickham (1981, 190). Calisto and Melibea is an adaptation of La Celestina; see Axton (1979, 69‚Äì96). It was most likely performed by itinerant players, possibly making use of a performing dog.Richardson and Johnston (1991, 54‚Äì55). In Early English Stages (1981), Wickham points to the existence of this play as evidence that the old- fashioned view that comedy began in England with Gammer Gurton's Needle and Ralph Roister Doister in the 1550s is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of medieval comic drama.Wickham (1981, 178). He argues that the play's \\"command of dramatic action and of comic mood and method is so deft as to make it well-nigh unbelievable\\" that it was the first of its kind in England.Wickham (1981, 190). Synopsis A student tries to woo a girl called Molly. Having confirmed that neither her father nor mother are at home, he declares his love for her: \\"I love you more than my life\\", he insists.\\"Y luf √æe mar √æan mi lif\\" (line 19); see Wickham (1976, 200‚Äì201). The original text makes use of the thorn letter. She rejects him, complaining of the deceitfulness of students: \\"For many a good woman have they brought to shame!\\"\\"Clerc of scole ne kep I none, / For many god wymman haf √æai don scam\\" (lines 28‚Äì29); see Wickham (1976, 200‚Äì201). The original text makes use of the thorn letter. He seeks the help of an old woman, Mother Eloise. He laments that he would rather die than live without Molly. He offers the old woman substantial financial rewards if she would agree to act as his go-between and reconcile him with the girl. The old woman becomes defensive and insists that whoever advised him to seek out her assistance has lied, for she is a god- fearing woman who would never involve herself in such matters.

He is the youngest son of 5 of an immigrant family from Italy (Sicily). Married to Patricia since May 1990, they have two children: C√©line (born 1993) and St√©phane (born 1995).  Early life  Salvatore Curaba's parents left Italy for Belgium in 1956. His father worked in the mines of Saint-Vaast, Fontaine l‚Äô√âv√™que and Sainte- Marguerite. After studying Math and Latin in Saint-Joseph school, Salvatore Curaba studied ICT Engineering at ICET Cuemes for 2 years.  Football career (1972‚Äì1991)  = Royale Association Athl√©tique Louvi√©roise = 1972‚Äì1982 As many kids of his age, Salvatore was passionate about football. He started playing at Royale Association Athl√©tique Louvi√©roise at 9 years old. He made his debut in the first team in 1982 at 19 years old in second division. 82-83: Second Division. Coach: Andr√© Gorez = Royal Charleroi Sporting Club = 83-84: Second Division. Coach: Eric Vanlessen 84-85: Second Division.

Coach: Andr√© Colasse 87-88: RCSC turned professional. Coach: Aim√© Anthuenis At the end of this season, after 70 matched played in First Division, Salvatore Curaba had to choose between a full-time professional football player career or an IT career. He opted for IT but kept playing football for the RAAL (third division). = Royale Association Ahtl√©tique Louvi√©roise = 88-89: Third Division. Coach: Casimir Jagiello 89-90: Third Division. Coach: Guy Fromont = Stade Louvain = 90-91: Second Division. Coach: Vince Biganti  Coach formation  At 27 years old, after few injuries, Salvatore Curaba decided to stop his football career and went for a football coach formation. 91-93: Belgian trainer school (UEFA B Certificate)  IT career (1983‚Äì1999)  = SBAI = In 1983, Salvatore Curaba started working at SBAI, an ICT company. He started as a programmer, became an analyst and after 3 years he was a project manager specialized in the hospital sector. While working for SBAI Salvatore was also a professional football player for the Royal Charleroi Sporting Club. = IBS =  Sales Rep  In 1988, after quitting his career as a professional football player for the Royal Charleroi Sporting Club, Salvatore Curaba became Sales representative for the IT company Proget (which will be bought by IBS in 1996).  Sales Manager  In 1994, Salvatore Curaba had to choose between a career as football coach or keep evolving in the IT sector. He opted for IT and was promoted Sales Manager for IBS. In 1998, after 10 years in this company and a few months before being nominated General Manager for IBS's Brussels offices, Salvatore left the company to found his own IT company, EASI.  Entrepreneurship career (1999-today)  = EASI =  Founder & Managing Partner  At the age of 35, Salvatore founded EASI on March 26, 1999 with Christian Castelain. EASI is a Belgian computer services company which offers solutions developed from the latest technology in sectors such as software and mobile applications, infrastructure and cloud computing. In 2012, the company counted 90 employees. This was an important tipping point. After more than 10 years of valuable collaboration between Salvatore Curaba and Christian Castelain, they decided that one person needed to take over the company. Salvatore decided to buy out his partner and became EASI's unique CEO. From this moment, Salvatore managed his company the way he always wanted to: he developed a unique management style based on freedom, share and transparency. His main objective is his company's performances combined to his employee's happiness. Salvatore Curaba has made the choice to regularly sell his company shares to his collaborators. Elected \\"Best Workplace\\" of Belgium in 2015 and 2016 and 8th ‚ÄúBest Workplace‚Äù in Europe, EASI devotes much attention to the happiness of its 150 employees. Salvatore Curaba has been nominated for the Manager of the Year award by Trends Tendances in 2014 and EASI was nominated for the Enterprise of the Year award 2015 by Ernst & Young. = Football clubs = In 2015, after more than 30 years away from the football sector, Salvatore Curaba was approached to take over the Royal Albert Elisabeth Club from Mons. The deal was never concluded. Later in 2015, the Union Royale la Louviere Centre also contacted him to take over the club. These negotiations didn't lead to a deal yet.  Public speaker  Since 2014, Salvatore Curaba regularly gives speeches and conferences all around Belgium to share his story, his management philosophy, EASI's keys to success and the happiness benefits. His speeches are particularly attractive because he likes to link his former challenges as professional football player with his career as a business man and entrepreneur.

The book was initially published in Canada by HarperCollins in 2007, and was a national bestseller. It was published in the United States as The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction, and translated versions were also published in Japan, South Korea and China. The book was taught as part of a university course in ‚ÄúForecasting via Mathematical Modeling‚Äù at Gustavus Adolphus College in 2009. Summary In this book, Orrell explains the science of prediction to a general audience. The book begins with a general history of prediction from the Delphic oracle to the present day. The next part considers three different areas of prediction in detail: weather, health and economics. It argues that these are all examples of complex systems that cannot be reduced to equations. As mathematical models become more refined, the number of unknown parameters tends to explode. At the same time, networks of interlocking feedback loops make the models unstable. According to Orrell, the resulting model error (rather than e.g. the butterfly effect) is the main reason why forecasts go wrong. In the final part, the book turns to predictions for the future, including the long-term effects of climate change. It concludes with some thoughts for the future, as well as a reminder that all such forecasts are unreliable. The title of the book is a reference to a mythical arrow that once belonged to the god Apollo. According to legend, the arrow was gifted by a priest to Pythagoras, allowing him to dart through space and time.

It is the second satellite of the EpicNG service, and will cover Europe, Africa and most of Asia from the 60¬∞East longitude, where it is expected to replace Intelsat 904. It has a mixed C band, Ku band and Ka band payload with all bands featuring wide and C and Ku also featuring spot beams. Satellite description Intelsat 33e was designed and manufactured by Boeing on the Boeing 702MP satellite bus. It has a launch mass of and a design life of more than 15 years. When stowed for launch, the satellite measures . It is powered by two wings, with four panels each, of triple-junction GaAs solar cells. The 702MP platform was designed to generate between 6 kW and 12 kW, but Intelsat 33e is designed to generate 13 kW at the end of its design life. Its payload is the second high throughput EpicNG deployment. The EpicNG is characterized by the implementation of frequency reuse due to a mix of frequency and polarization in small spot beams. Not only applied to the classical HTS Ka band, but also applying the same technique in Ku band and C band. The EpicNG series also keep the use of wide beams to offer high throughput and broadcast capabilities in the same satellite. In the case of Intelsat 33e, the C band side has 20 transponders with a total downlink bandwidth of 2,670 MHz. The spot beams offer high bandwidth for Europe, Central Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, and a wide beam covers sub-Saharan Africa. The Ku band has 249 transponder equivalent for a total downlink bandwidth of 9,194 MHz. The Ku spot beams cover Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, while a wide beam can broadcast to Europe, Middle East and Asia. The Ka band payload has 450 MHz of bandwidth on a global beam centered at its position. History In July 2009, Intelsat became the first customer of the Boeing 702MP platform, when it place an order for four spacecrafts, Intelsat 21, Intelsat 22, Intelsat 27 and the first EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e. In May 2013, Intelsat made a second order for an additional four EpicNG satellites, the first of which would be Intelsat 33e. On July 15, 2016, Senior Space Program Managers Richard Laurie and Brian Sing blogged that they had been on the Boeing factory overseeing the transport preparations for Intelsat 33e to French Guiana. There it would join another Intelsat satellite, Intelsat 36, for integration on the Ariane 5 ECA launcher, which was expected to launch on August 24. On July 22, 2016, Intelsat announced that Intelsat 33e had arrived to the Guiana Space Center for launch preparations. It also announced not only communication but aeronautical and maritime mobility clients that were expecting the satellite service. On July 27, it was explained that the satellite had traveled by truck from the factory to an airport in California, where it was loaded in an Antonov 124. It flew to Florida for a refuelling stop and then flew straight to Kourou airport. At the French launch site, even though Intelsat is the owner of the two passengers of the Ariane 5 VA 232 flight, they have separate launch teams. Each satellite is built by a different manufacturer, and it has a different supervisor team within Intelsat. On August 24, 2016, at 22:16:01 UTC, after a slight delay due to a rocket issue, the Ariane 5 ECA VA-232 flight launched from Guiana Space Center ELA-3, with Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36. At 22:44 UTC, Intelsat 33e separated from the rocket's upper stage. After 41 minutes of flight, both satellites had separated successfully. Intelsat confirmed that it had received the satellites signals as expected after separation. Arianespace estimated the insertion orbit as 248.7 km √ó 35,858 km √ó 5.98¬∞, very close to the target of 249.0 km √ó 35,879 km √ó 6.00¬∞. On September 9, 2016, Intelsat announced that due to a malfunction in the LEROS primary thruster, it would require more time for orbit rising and thus the service date had been moved from the last quarter of 2016 to the first of 2017. On September 22, insurance officials estimated that the main propulsion failure would not reduce the on orbit life of the spacecraft more than 18 months. This could translate to an insurance claim by Intelsat of around 10% of the satellite service life, which could have a value close to 40 million dollars. Intelsat 33e entered service on 29 January 2017, three months later than planned.

Funding and support Funding issues proved a major challenge for Guinea's participation at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The NPC relies on grants to insure they can buy plane tickets to fund travel to international events, and there were problems acquiring grant funding because of shortfalls in funds from the Brazilian organizers. This was in part a result of only 220,000 of the 2.5 million tickets to watch the Games in Rio being sold a month ahead of the Games. Disability classifications Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

In London he met and was influenced by R. H. Tawney, and Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb, as well as, once again, Harold Laski, who had returned to London after having been dismissed from Harvard for supporting the Boston Police Strike.\\"Autobiography.\\" For three years Brand was an instructor in English history at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. In 1924 he became an assistant professor at Stanford teaching English history, then an associate professor in 1930 and a professor in 1940. He retired from Stanford in 1958, after thirty-four years. He was proud that he had taught at Stanford for half of its existence. Oriental rug collection On a month- long visit to Istanbul in 1928, Brand began what was to become a lifelong collection of oriental rugs. While exploring the bazaar, he made the fortuitous acquaintance of Rudolf Riefstahl, the American pioneer in the appreciation of Turkish and Persian rugs for their artistic value. Also advised by another early American expert, Arthur Upham Pope, Brand concentrated on Turkish and Persian, as well as Caucasian and Turkmen carpets, handmade before the use of aniline dyes. He eventually acquired a collection of many dozens at its greatest extent. Large bales purchased for relatively small amounts of money would arrive in California still redolent of the camels that had transported them in Persia and Turkey. One noteworthy prayer rug from Dagestan had a woven-in date equivalent to 1814/15 AD. Rare embroidered Uzbekistan Susanis made by young girls for their bridal chests have appreciated greatly in value. Personal life In 1930 Brand was married to Nan Alwida Surface, the daughter of Dr. Frank M. Surface, a director under Herbert Hoover in the Department of Commerce, and later an executive with Standard Oil of New Jersey (now part of ExxonMobil). The Brands had three sons, Charles in 1932, Robert in 1934, and Donald in 1937. During World War II, the family sent some 1,600 bundles of food and clothing, collected from students and friends, to Britain over six years. Their home near the Stanford campus became known as a center of hospitality for holiday parties. Great effort was put into the creation of a locally famous garden, noted especially for its roses. Many years later the property was sold to the physicist Edward Teller. Professor Brand died at Stanford University Hospital in 1981 after a brief illness. He was 88 years old.

As technology has progressed, the United States has known variations such as phonograph dealers, radio stores, hi-fi stores, stereo stores, and audio video stores. The history of the genre of retailer may date back to phonograph dealers as far back as 1893, including specialized phonograph stores as well as music stores which carried a wider array of music-related merchandise. With the advent of radio, with radio receiving equipment being sold by specialist electric hardware shops, there was controversy as to whether radio equipment manufactures should sell wholesale to phonograph and music stores, and to department stores, but in 1923 Federal Telephone & Telegraph Co. started doing so and other manufacturers started suit. Wireless Age estimated that there were 15,000 phonograph dealers in the U.S. in that year. In the mid-1950s hi-fi stereo equipment hit the mainstream market and references began to \\"hi-fi stores\\". As demand grew for sets of audio components such as tuners, phonographs, receivers and speakers, many regional specialty audio/video chains were established and grew through the 1980s. Boston's Tweeter grew and eventually purchased chains in other regions, such as Bryn Mawr Stereo (Philadelphia), Hi-Fi Buys (Atlanta) Showcase Home Entertainment and Dow (San Diego). These chains added value versus other retailers of audio video equipment such as department stores, discount stores and appliance stores, by providing highly trained salespeople, a wide, often high-end selection of merchandise, and facilities where customers could experience the sound and video of the components By the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. was covered by pan-regional and national chains of big box retailers, such as the defunct Circuit City and The Good Guys and the extant Best Buy, where audio and video was a major line of merchandise, next to home appliances, cellphones and computers, putting pressure on independent dealers. As by the 2010s, technology provided the vast majority of consumers with a high quality audio and video experience via their smartphone and cheap flatscreen televisions, a mass consumer market in the U.S. for larger audio and video components ‚Äî other than televisions and smaller items ‚Äî has vanished.

It is associated with Digambara sect of Jainism. Constructed in Dravidian architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the reign of Pallava dynasty during the 8th century with later contribution from Medieval Cholas, later Pallavas and Vijayanagar kings. The temple is administered by Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu as a protected monument, while it is maintained by hereditary trustees. The temple along with the Chandraprabha temple in the surrounding precinct the region is referred as Jaina Kanchi, along with the other two parts of the town being named Shiva Kanchi and Vishnu Kanchi. History Pallavas, the rulers of the region embraced Jainism during their early years. As per local legend, the temple was constructed by the Pallava disciple of the sages Vamana and Mallisena. There are other legends which attribute the construction of the temple by Simhavishnu, the first Pallava king during the last decade of 6th century. The temple is believed to have been built during 8th century around 800 AD during the reign of Pallava kings. It has inscriptions from Pallava king, Narasimhavarman II (700-728 CE) and the following Medieval Chola kings Rajendra Chola I (1054-63 CE), Kulothunga Chola I (1070-1120 CE) and Vikrama Chola (1118-35 CE), and the Kanarese inscriptions of Krishnadevaraya (1509-29 CE). The Chola and Vijayanagar inscriptions indicate large endowments to the temple. Krishnadevaraya helped repaint the 13th century paintings during the 15th-16th centuries. The temple is maintained by Tamil Nadu archaeological department. The temple tower is believed to have been constructed by Sage Pushpasena Vamanarya during 1199. The walls of the temple are believed to have been constructed by Azhagiya Pallavan during the 13th century. There is a musical hall in the temple (called Sangeetha Mandapa) built by Irugappa, the minister of Vijayanagara king during 1387. Architecture The roof top of the three shrines in the temple The temple is built in Dravidian architecture with a three-tiered gopuram (gateway tower). There are three parallel shrines in the temple with the image of Mahavira occupying the centre. The image of Lokanathar, the 24th Tirthankara is located on the Northern side, while Neminatha housed in the Southern side. All the three sanctums are circular in shape housing the bronze images. The sanctum of Mahavira accommodates Dharmadevi and a Tirthankara on either of his sides. There are painted pillars in the hall leading to the sanctum. As in other South Indian Hindu temples, there is a flag post (called Dwajasthambam) in between and axial to the entrance and the sanctum. The temple has a large number of paintings on the ceilings that are captioned in Tamil Grantha script. It is believed that Jain scriptures have the life story of Krishna assimilated and most of the paintings depict the life story of Krishna. An Adinatha subshrine is one of its kind found in this temple. The structure of the temple has undergone several changes over the centuries, but the image of Adinatha remains the same from the 16th century. Culture Trilokyanatha Temple was originally under the control of traditional trustees for 600 years till 1991. From then, the temple is maintained and administered by Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu as a protected monument. Kanchipuram was once seat of Jainism and a famous centre of learning. As per tradition, the place where the temple is located is called Parutti meaning cotton. The tradition continues in modern times as Kanchipuram is a famous centre of hand-woven silk sarees. The Jain ascetics in the region enjoyed royal patronage and propagated Digambara sect of Jainism.

The monument is located on the eastern border of Maine's Baxter State Park. History Roxanne Quimby, a co-founder of US company Burt's Bees, and her foundation, Elliotsville Plantation, Inc., began purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 before formally announcing their plans in 2011 that the land would one day become part of a national park. However, following opposition by state and federal politicians to the creation of a national park, Quimby changed her focus to a national monument, which could be created with a proclamation by the president under the Antiquities Act. On August 23, 2016, Elliotsville Plantation and the Quimby Family Foundation donated the land (valued at $60 million), plus $20 million to fund initial operations and a commitment of $20 million in future support, to the federal government. On August 24, 2016, the eve of the National Park Service centennial, President Barack Obama proclaimed of land as the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument.Higgins, A.J. \\"It's Official: Obama Declares Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument\\" (August 24, 2016). Maine Public Broadcasting. Opposition Many people opposed the monument, with some concerned about federal intrusion into the lands of Northern Maine. One of the most vocal opponents to the creation of the National Monument was Paul LePage, who became the state's Governor in January 2011. He called the monument \\"unilateral action against the will of the people, this time the citizens of rural Maine.\\" It has been suggested that President Donald Trump could act to reverse the creation of the Monument, a move local opponents would like him to consider. Trump was critical of the Monument's creation during 2016 campaign appearances in Maine. A President has never reversed the creation of a predecessor's Monument, and an opinion written by the U.S. Attorney General in 1938 suggests a President may not do so. Supporters of the Monument called such a so-far hypothetical abolition a \\"destructive step\\". United States Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, did not recommend to President Trump in a December 2017 report for the Monument to be shrunk or its creation reversed, instead advising that the Monument's management and development plans be slightly changed. Human settlements Human settlement in the region dates back 11,000 years, with Native peoples having relied on the woods and its waterways for their livelihood and even transportation. The Penobscot Indian Nation, along with other Wabanaki tribes, still regard the Penobscot River as an important landmark of their culture. The first recorded European exploration of the region occurred in 1793 with a survey commissioned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, of which Maine was still a part. Shortly after statehood in 1820, the Maine government began surveying the lands around the current National Monument. For over 100 years, from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, logging was the primary industry in the area. The Maine Woods were made famous by the writings of Henry David Thoreau in the 1850s, and later saw such visitors as Theodore Roosevelt and Maine Governor Percival Baxter, who later designated the lands to the immediate west of the National Monument to become Baxter State Park. Geology The bedrock of Katahdin Woods and Waters spans over 150 million years of the Paleozoic era, revealing well-intact exposures of Paleozoic rock strata with visible fossils. In the lands west of the Penobscot River's East Branch, volcanic rock from the Devonian period, mostly Katahdin granite and some Traveler rhyolite, is prevalent.

It operated from 1913 to 1992. History Stoneyetts was chartered in 1910 and designed by Glasgow Parish Council's Master of Works, Robert Tannock, with the foundation stone being laid by council chairman James Cunningham on 23 May 1912. The hospital was built on a 46¬Ω acre site, purchased by the council from the District Lunacy Board, at East Muckcroft within the \\"Woodilee estate\\"; the total cost of the project was ¬£45,000 (including a cost of ¬£70 per bed). The facility contained six 50-bed brick villas; official, administrative and laundry blocks; housing for staff; and a hall with various workrooms that accommodated 320 people (the functions of the hospital buildings and rooms would change over the years). Cunningham conducted the opening ceremony on 6 June 1913. Originally intended for the treatment of people with epilepsy, Stoneyetts was the first Poor Law epileptic colony in Scotland and the only Scottish hospital ever built for epileptic individuals. A remote location was chosen to shield patients from the general public. The still-active Stoneyetts Bowling Club (pictured in 2006) was linked to the hospital Following the passing of the Mental Deficiency and Lunacy (Scotland) Act 1913, Stoneyetts became a facility for intellectually disabled people ‚Äì then termed \\"mental defectives\\" ‚Äì who had been held in asylums for the insane. As well as housing civilians, Stoneyetts received convicts who had been deemed mentally \\"defective\\"; Glasgow Govan MP Neil Maclean disapproved of \\"young lads, guilty merely of a little horse-play or a boyish escapade\\" being held at the institution. The facility faced problems with overcrowding: arrangements were made with Falkirk Parish Council for patients to be cared for at Blinkbonny Home, and the remaining residents were transferred to the new Lennox Castle Hospital by December 1936. Following restoration, Stoneyetts was re-opened as a unit for certified mental patients on 7 August 1937. The revised unit was headed by chief physician Dr Alexander Dick. Its first admissions were a number of Woodilee Hospital residents, owing to recent weather damage to that facility. Regular entertainment was provided for patients and staff: a cinema showing was supplied weekly, while the \\"Stoneyetts Concert Party\\" consisted of the kitchen staff and two female patients. With the inception of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, Stoneyetts was linked with Woodilee and Gartloch hospitals under a single board of management. In 1954 there were 340 staffed beds. Improvements to the facility were carried out in 1950, at a cost of ¬£6,800. These included an extension to the laundry, the addition of verandas to two of the villas and the erection of a designated patients' cafeteria. A television set was installed in May 1953, courtesy of Sir John Stirling- Maxwell, and a new oil-fired boiler was implemented in the late 1960s. The institution was upgraded and modernised circa 1975. A number of proposed improvements to the hospital were thwarted by the health board's inability to gain sufficient funding over the years. In 1989, a ¬£9,700 minibus was presented to Stoneyetts by the Parks and Recreation Charities Club. By the early 1970s there was a changing emphasis toward psychogeriatric care at Stoneyetts. The institution became home to numerous Woodilee Hospital residents following the discovery of severe structural defects in the fabric of that facility's buildings on 13 March 1987 (dubbed \\"Black Friday\\" by Lenzie residents). In 1988, patients at Stoneyetts ranged in age from 33 to 87, and included people with schizophrenia, new chronic sick, long-term geriatrics, and residents being prepared for rehabilitation. Three years later, patients were aged 40 to 98. As of October 1991, the hospital had 180 beds and 260 staff members. Two local streets were laid that share the \\"Stoneyetts\\" name: Stoneyetts Road in Moodiesburn, and Stoneyetts Drive within Woodilee Village, Lenzie. Closure Stoneyetts was in serious need of funding by mid 1989; a fundraiser was organised at the Knights of St Columba social club in Moodiesburn. In May 1991, however, NHS Greater Glasgow announced its plans to close institution, with a view to transfer patients and staff to other locations. Proponents for its closure described the facility's accommodation as \\"outdated\\" and \\"sub-standard\\". Tom Clarke, MP for Monklands West, led the opposition against closure. Hospital workers feared that Stoneyetts was being intentionally run down to justify its termination; the Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE) had produced a catalogue of complaints against the institution in 1986, citing cockroach and mould infestation, dilapidated surroundings, and staff shortages. Unions threatened to occupy the facility and organise a work-in if the plans went ahead. Despite union opposition, as well as public outcry and protesting by workers, Scottish Health Minister, Michael Forsyth, announced his approval of the closure plans on 24 October 1991. COHSE official Jim Devine described Forsyth's ruling as \\"an affront to democracy\\", while Tom Clarke called it a \\"ruthless decision made on commercial not caring grounds\\". Clarke demanded a probe into the hospital's closure. Operations at Stoneyetts officially ceased on 19 February 1992. Aftermath Entrance to the former site, 2012 NHS Greater Glasgow retained ownership of the land and allowed local players to continue running the hospital's bowling venue after the main buildings were demolished. The desolate area became a popular location for vandalism, fly tipping and underage drinking; concerns were raised with regard to children playing on the site, particularly due to the presence of discarded hypodermic needles. Locals regularly walked their dogs in the less decayed sections. On 25 September 1999, an 11-year-old boy died after falling 50 feet from a tree in the woods. In October 2001, the Stoneyetts area again became the cause of public unrest when the Scottish Prison Service expressed interest in purchasing the former hospital grounds to build a jail there. Several elements of the hospital site remained into the 2010s, such as a tree outline of the grounds, largely overgrown roads, unpowered street lighting, a disused football pitch, and building remnants including an accessible basement. The nearby Stoneyetts Cottages still stand, despite being secluded from the site by the intersecting 2011 M80 motorway extension. In November 2016, the Stoneyetts land was put up for sale as a residential development site. The following year Miller Homes purchased the area for 291 planned homes, while agreeing to retain Stoneyetts Bowling Club and much of the surrounding woodland; adjacent land by the entrance was procured by Persimmon for 60 proposed builds. Persimmon gained clearance from North Lanarkshire Council in November 2018, while Miller received permission in February 2019.

The club won the Scottish Junior Cup in their debut season at this level, defeating Dunipace Juniors 1‚Äì0 at Firhill Park, Glasgow in front of a crowd of 9,564. They were the first club from Fife to win the Junior Cup, and remained the only one to do so until St Andrews United triumphed in 1960. The club played on through World War I using scratch sides drawn from military personnel then enjoyed local success in Fife before going into abeyance in 1927 due to ground issues. Rejoining in 1929, the club continued to pick up local honours but United closed down for a second time at the beginning of World War II. They reformed as a Juvenile side after the war, but only played one further season at Junior level in 1958‚Äì59. The club closed completely in 1963. Their Ballast Bank ground was used many years later by another Junior side, Dunfermline Jubilee Athletic, who arrived from Cowdenbeath in 1973 and left for Pitreavie Stadium in 1989.

The operation consisted of research and information gathering about Catalan independence politicians without judicial authorization. The operation allegedly included the creation or use of false evidence, data manipulation, irregular reports, secret agents, leaks to the press and the use of threats to obtain confidential information. The operation allegedly started after the 2012 Catalan independence demonstration. The heads of the National Police started an extrajudicial operation that was kept secret even within the corps. The operation consisted of investigating and compiling information from politicians that were favorable to the independence of Catalonia without any judicial authorization. To do this, two methods were allegedly used: a special and secret unit of the National Police Corps, depending on the Ministry of the Interior (Spain), and also through the Spanish embassy in Andorra, dependent on the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation.  History of the case  On July 6, 2016, the Ex- Commissary of the National Police Corps, Jos√© Manuel Villarejo, revealed in court that he worked with former head of the internal affairs unit, Marcelino Mart√≠n Blas, to stop the pro-independence movement. Villarejo admitted that he was in charge of \\"investigating crimes\\", while Mart√≠n Blas was devoted to \\"appointments\\", \\"stories\\" and \\"finding sources\\". He also said that among the sources that Mart√≠n Blas had used there was the former head of the Anti-Fraud Office of Catalonia, Daniel de Alfonso, who also appeared in the recordings released earlier of the two meetings held in October 2014 with the Spanish interior minister, Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az, in which both allegedly conspired to seek evidence against pro-independence politicians. On July 11, 2016 a police report was made public, signed by Marcelino Mart√≠n Blas, that confirmed the existence of the Operation Catalunya and which states that one of the duties of Commissary Jos√© Villarejo \\"during the last legislature was investigating \\"the Catalan independence process.\\" On August 18, 2016, former president of Banca Privada d'Andorra, Higini Cierco, reported that he had received pressure from members of the Ministry of the Interior (Spain) and the heads of the national police to obtain banking information of some pro-independence politicians and their families. In particular, he assured that he had received threats and been blackmailed by Celestino Barroso, attach√© from the Ministry of the Interior to the embassy of Spain in Andorra, and by Marcelino Mart√≠n Blas, Chief of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Spanish National Police . The former lawyer of the Cierco brothers, Jaume Bartumeu, confirmed the threats and extortions of the Spanish police in the Cierco. On August 22, 2016, the BPA case's Judge Can√≤lich Mingorance decided to notify the creation of two new causes as a result of the statements made by the Cierco brothers and sent an order to start a criminal investigation about the presumed threats and coercion exercised by the Government of Spain over the Managers of the Private Bank of Andorra to filter information that would undermine the independence process. On August 30, 2016 it was announced by the investigative commission formed by the Parliament of Catalonia that the Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy participated in the operation. The president sent his head of Cabinet, Jorge Moragas, and the Secretary of State for Commerce, Jaime Garc√≠a-Legaz, to Andorra to get the BPA owners to hand over bank statements, violating Andorran law. On July 18, 2017 the commission announced their intent to present a demand against the ten people under investigation for refusing to testify before the commission, all of them high-ranking officials of the Spanish government. Doing so is a crime under Spanish law. As of July 20, 2017 the investigation has reached impasse due to the blocking of any proposal in congress.

According to two complaints and a series of messages from WhatsApp, he was an intermediary between the police force of the operation Catalonia and the detectives Perib√°√±ez and Tamarit, who had made reports for the anti-independent police plot. * Marcelino Mart√≠n Blas: alias \\"F√©lix\\" while he was the head of Internal Affairs of the National Police, was one of the strong men of Pino and directed the secret police unit until Fernandez Diaz dismissed him. He has in an open dispute with Villarejo, who considers him a man of the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia, with whom he is also confronted. He traveled to Barcelona with Olivera in 2012 to try to persuade the prosecutors Bermejo and S√°nchez Elled to reactivate the investigation of the Millet case, with a draft of an apocryphal report, and to search the CDC headquarters. After not accomplishing it, the draft was leaked, based on information extracted from the internet. * Jos√© Luis Olivera: while head of the Economic and Fiscal Crimes Unit (UDEF) he traveled with Mart√≠n Blas to Barcelona.

After more than 15 years of stay in Russia, he left the country in 1748 after empress Elizabeth Petrowna had denounced two of his doctor colleagues as Jews. Having had the chance, amid the daily proscriptions which he witnessed to be allowed to leave the country, he took the way to Paris in 1748 where he ended his life. After she ascended to the throne, Catherine the Great rewarded him for his services with a pension of 1000 rubles, which was punctually paid until his death.

Funding  Some private funding supported Fijian participation at the Paralympic Games. $4,000 was donated to the team by the International School Suva. These funds were raised as part of a Fun Day event run by the school. Fiji Athletics received $5,000 in sponsorship in July 2016. This money was shared between Olympic and Paralympic athletics.  Team  The national team coach is Fred Fatiaki.  Disability classifications  Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.  Athletics  Athletes from Fiji tried to qualify for the Rio Paralympics. One such athlete was Varayame Naikolevu. He competed at the Melanesian Athletics Championship, and an IPC Athletics event in Brisbane, Queensland in the shot put but was unable to set a qualifying mark for the Rio Games.

The half-t distribution results as the special case of \\\\mu=0, and the standardized version as the special case of \\\\sigma=1.

He made translations of works of Pindar and Horace. His own poems celebrated the \\"genius of Britain\\", which to him was both artistic and military. He was also interested in science, including physiognomy. Life William Tasker was born in 1740 at Iddesleigh, Devon. He was the only son of William Tasker (1708‚Äì1772) and Jane Vickries (died 1795). His father was rector of Iddesleigh, Devonshire, from 6 July 1738. He was educated at Barnstaple, then attended Exeter College, Oxford, matriculating on 20 February 1758. He remained there as sojourner and obtained a B.A. on 2 February 1762. On 24 June 1764 he was ordained deacon, and next day was made curate of Monk-Okehampton, near Iddesleigh. He was ordained a priest on 12 July 1767. Tasker became rector of Iddesleigh on 6 November 1772, after his father died. Tasker was a friend of Dr. William Hunter, attended his lectures, and studied botany in the gardens at Kew. James Boswell describes a meeting between Tasker and Samuel Johnson on 16 March 1779, where Tasker asked for Johnson's opinion of his poems. Boswell wrote, \\"The bard was a lank, bony figure, with short black hair; he was writhing himself in agitation while Johnson read, and, showing his teeth in a grin of earnestness, exclaimed in broken sentences and in a keen, sharp tone, 'Is that poetry, sir‚Äîis it Pindar?. Isaac D'Israeli later said this description was true. Tasker was an admirer of the poetess Mary Robinson (1757‚Äì1800), whom he praised as the \\"Sweet Sappho of our Isle.\\" Tasker was careless with his finances. The revenues of his benefice were placed under sequestration on 23 March 1780. He said that his \\"unletter'd brother-in-law\\" had obtained the sequestration in an \\"illegal mode\\" through \\"merciless and severe persecutions and litigations\\". His brother in law had died by 1790. Writing to Gough Nichols, editor of the Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine in 1797, Tasker said he was \\"confined in my dreary situation at Starvation-Hall, 40 miles below Exeter, out of the verge of Literature & where even your extensive magazine has never yet reached.\\" William Tasker died after a long and painful illness at Iddesleigh rectory on 4 February 1800. At the time of his death he was working on a history of physiognomy from Aristotle to Lavater. He was buried near the chancel of the Church of St James, Iddesleigh. Atablet was erected on the north wall of the church tower. His widow, Eleonora, died at Exbourne on 2 January 1801, aged 56, and was buried in the same grave with her husband. They had no children. Work and reception Nereus Prophecy: A Sea-Piece (1779) Tasker thought the results of the Seven Years' War (1754‚Äì63) had only been the growth of corruption and luxury at home. He wrote several poems on the Anglo-French War (1778‚Äì83) in which he represented the Earl of Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty, as being at the centre of a selfish and corrupt network. Tasker saw the action by Admiral Augustus Keppel at the Battle of Ushant as a great victory, which he celebrated in his poem Nereus's Prophecy: A Sea-Piece Sketched off Ushant (1779). The cover of this poem has a cartoon in which Sandwich and Hugh Palliser are showing hanging from a gallows, laden with emblems that show they are guilty, while a seated courtesan weeps over their fate. In A congratulatory Ode to Admiral Keppel (1779) he wrote of Keppel, whom he saw as representing the interests of the honest trading community in England, In his Elegy on the Death of David Garrick (1779) Tasker celebrates the artistic genius of Garrick, Shakespeare and Reynolds, and implicitly links it to the warlike genius of the nation. In his Ode to the Warlike Genius of Great Britain (1780) he urged Britain to wake up and defeat the aggressors. The ‚ÄòOde to the Warlike Genius‚Äô was dedicated to Lord Amherst. Some new stanzas were spoken before the king at Weymouth. The Gentleman's Magazine said the poem was \\"well-calculated to rouse the martial spirit of the nation\\". He complemented the Duchess of Devonshire in the poem for wearing riding dress at the Cox- heath military camp, calling her the \\"Genius of Britain\\". The Gentleman's magazine called Tasker's play Arviragus, a Tragedy (1796), written during the French Revolution, a \\"bold attempt towards a national drama\\", and pointed out the contemporary relevance, The Gentleman's Magazine quoted The War-Song of Clewillin, The British Bard in March 1797. The poem called on the soldiers to \\"Rush on the foe without dismay,  Like roaring lions on their prey.\\" In the years that followed the magazine would praise Tasker's work as \\"so well calculated to animate loyal Britons against invaders, and to inspire the necessary unanimity and concord ... exceedingly well adapted to the present times; since it breathes a three-fold spirit of Poetry, Loyalty, and Patriotism.\\" the Gentleman's Magazine serialised the 1780 Ode to the Warlike Genius of Great Britain over nine editions from December 1798 to August 1799. In the poem, Tasker says the role of the divinely inspired bards is to \\"Inspire the sons of Mars in dreams,  And fire their souls in warlike themes.\\" Publications Tasker's published works included: *. 2nd edition 1779, 3rd edition with other poems, 1779.

The government of Tanzania through the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, in partnership with the BG Group (a division of Royal Dutch Shell), Equinor, Exxon Mobil, and Ophir Energy, plans to build an onshore liquefied natural gas export terminal at this location in Lindi. History The first offshore discovery of natural gas in Tanzania was made in 2010. Since then, other finds have been made by several petroleum prospecting companies, which decided in 2014 to build a liquefaction facility in Lindi, targeting primarily the Asian market. In August 2016, Tanzanian President John Magufuli publicly urged government bureaucrats to fast track the project so that construction could start. The government of Tanzania announced in May 2016 its plan to build a gas pipeline to neighboring Uganda. Stakeholders Talks between the government of Tanzania and the six oil companies involved in the project began in earnest in September 2016. The oil companies involved include: * Equinor ASA (formerly Statoil ASA) * ExxonMobil * BG Group * Royal Dutch Shell Plc * Ophir Energy Plc * Pavilion Energy Private Limited Also participating in the talks are the following parastatal agencies of the Tanzanian government. * Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation * Petroleum Upstream Regulatory Authority * Tanzania Electric Supply Company Negotiations In May 2018, The East African reported that the government of Tanzania was searching for a transaction adviser, to guide the Tanzania Petroleum Development Company through negotiations for a Host Government Agreement with the gas project developers. The two year contract for the selected adviser involves the development of a technical, legal and commercial framework for the LNG project. The adviser is also responsible for supporting and building capacity of the government team, as well as crafting the appropriate strategy in the negotiations towards the \\"host government agreement\\". In June 2018, the Tanzanian English-language newspaper, The Citizen, reported that the projected start date was now in 2022. Construction In May 2019, the EastAfrican newspaper reported that construction was planned to start in 2022 and conclude in 2028, as announced by the Tanzanian Minister of Energy, Medard Kalemani.

She took a journey all throughout Europe, and tales of her trip were recorded in French and American newspapers and pamphlets of that age. After returning to the United States, her portrait was painted and hung up for display in Washington D.C. to show off her skills and determination.  Early life  Sacred Sun was born in 1809 in what is now Saline County along the Missouri River in Missouri. Her Osage name was Mi-Ho‚Äôn-Ga. As a baby, Sacred Sun and other Osage children were strapped to a tree branch on a board while their mothers worked tending gardens, preserving food, and doing other domestic work. By the age of 12 Sacred Sun was expected to do her share of work. She knew how to care for children, sew, hunt, and preserve meat and food. According to her culture, it is likely her father arranged a husband for her around the age of 14.  Journey  In 1827, Sacred Sun was 18 years old when she was taken to France with eleven other people from her tribe by David de Launay. De Launay, a French-born resident of St. Louis, presented himself as a representative of the American Government and a friend of two people who were going to take a group of Osage to Washington, D.C. However, he instead took them to Europe and used them for his own pleasure and profit. De Launay gathered the 12 people and loaded their furs onto a raft and set off for St. Louis. Halfway there their raft crashed and all of their furs were lost. Half of the Osage decided to return to the village at this point, while the other half including Sacred Sun continued on the planned journey. This group included five other Osage Native Americans: Little Chief, Hawk Woman, Black Bird, Minckchatahooh, and Big Soldier. They joined de Launay in St. Louis, and boarded a steamboat that took them down the Mississippi to New Orleans, from when they set sail for France.  In France  Sacred Sun and the rest of the trip members arrived in France on July 27, 1827 where they were greeted at the court of King Charles X by many excited and curious French citizens and showered with gifts. They asked for food and drink and were served many kinds of wine, At first, the King himself even expressed how pleased he was to have them there and how he was satisfied. He told how the Osage had always been faithful to France, and how he hoped that they were turn out to be equally faithful allies to the United States. Sacred Sun was seen as extremely beautiful by the people of France, and they took a liking to her. It was only after all the Indians arrived and had been greeted that they realized they would be a part of a \\"Wild West Show\\" and this was the main reason for their journey.  Hardships  After the popularity of the Indian tribe wore off, de Launay went broke and was imprisoned for not paying his debts, leaving the tribe on their own. At first, they refused to beg for food so they had nothing to eat. During the time of her journey, Sacred Sun was pregnant with twins and she wanted to go home to be able to care for them. On February 8, 1828 she gave birth to her twin daughters in a hotel room in Belgium. Both girls were named traditional French names, and Sacred Sun decided to let a wealthy French woman adopt one daughter while she kept the other. Sacred Sun and the other members of her Osage tribe spent two years wandering alone through France, Holland, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy. They spent time begging for food and places to sleep at night, but eventually they had a saving grace. A local newspaper wrote about their struggles, and French royalty came to their rescue. The Marquis de LaFayette sent Sacred Sun, her baby and another tribe member Kihegashugah back to America on a ship. Unfortunately, Minckchatahooh, was killed on the journey back home due to smallpox. But Sacred Sun and her baby arrived safely in Virginia in 1829. Her husband and others followed a few months later.  Legacy and death  Once she arrived home, Sacred Sun and her baby were idolized by many. The Superintendent of Indian Trade, Thomas L. McKenney, had the artist Charles Bird King paint a portrait of Sacred Sun and her baby. It was hung in the National Indian Portrait Gallery for 36 years until it was destroyed by a fire. Thankfully, this portrait can still be found in the book History of the Indian Tribes of North America because copies of all portraits were made before the fire. in the summer of 1830 Sacred Sun traveled back to St. Louis where she and her child lived until her death. Sacred Sun was said to have died in 1836 at the age of 27.

It was founded in July 2014 by brothers Ben and Julian Kurland with the goal of lowering household monthly bills from Telecommunications service providers. BillFixers is an Expert as a service (ExaaS) or Justice-as- a-service company, which optimizes on work that feels menial to individual consumers. As of February 2020, BillFixers has over 25,000 clients and claims a combined savings of over $5,000,000.  History  Ben and Julian Kurland founded the company in Nashville, Tennessee in July, 2014. Later that year, a customer service call between Comcast and tech entrepreneur/journalist Ryan Block went viral. The Kurlands posted on Reddit about their speciality in haggling with Comcast and thus received their first customers. In the first year, the Kurlands and their cousin Peter Zimbicki were the sole negotiators. By 2016, the business had grown to over 1,200 clients and was featured on NBC Nightly News and in The New York Times.  Services  BillFixers works primarily on TV, internet, and phone bills, although their services may extend to satellite radio, home security, and propane bills. They claim a 95% success rate and average savings of $300 per bill. = How it Works = The service operates by hiring experts to negotiate on behalf of consumers. When a client submits their bill, BillFixers calls the provider (like Comcast or AT&T;) to seek a lowered rate. Their success is due to industry know-how and expertise on promotional & custom deals. The business generates revenue on a contingency basis, meaning payment is reliant on customer's savings.  Reception  BillFixers was praised by NBC News as an \\"ingenious idea\\", and a CNET review reports 100% satisfaction. In September 2015, BillFixers was nominated as the Small Business Innovator of the Year by USA Today. A 2016 article in The New York Times questioned the legality of negotiators representing themselves as clients, but found no violation.

He is the first female-to-male transsexual to have been accredited as a leader with the breastfeeding support organization, La Leche League. Life Having been assigned female at birth, MacDonald transitioned to male by taking testosterone and undergoing chest surgery. When he and his partner decided to start a family, on advice from a doctor, MacDonald stopped hormone therapy and was able to become pregnant. Although MacDonald did not plan to breastfeed and assumed it would not be possible, he decided to try after learning that \\"even a small amount of milk could be really valuable to my baby,\\" and that \\"breastfeeding is about more than the milk. It can be a relationship too and a whole way of parenting.\\" Career =Application for La Leche League leadership= Before his child was born, MacDonald sought peer-to-peer support from his local chapter of La Leche League (LLL), the international breastfeeding organization. He was later asked to assume a volunteer leadership position. However, La Leche League Canada (LLLC) rejected his query, saying \\"the topic has never arisen in the 56-year history of our organization\\" and \\"since an LLLC leader is a mother who breastfed a baby, a man cannot become an LLLC leader.\\" The board of La Leche League International (LLLI) reviewed the policy, citing its mandate to be a \\"nondiscriminatory service organization.\\" A year later, they revised their policy to allow leaders to serve no matter their gender. LLLI spokesperson Diana West commented, ‚ÄúIt was thought that only women could breastfeed. Once it became clear it wasn‚Äôt as straightforward as that, the policy had to change. We‚Äôre just trying to be on the right side of history. Yes, we took a year to do it, but we did it in a way that was fair and unequivocal.‚Äù In 2016, MacDonald became the first-ever transgender man to be accredited as a La Leche League leader. LLLI said in a statement to other leaders: \\"We recognize that any breastfeeding parent, regardless of whether they self-identify as a mother or father, should be - and is now - welcome to investigate LLL Leadership. There are other prerequisites that a potential Leader needs to satisfy, but being a woman isn't one of them.‚Äù =Research= In 2014, MacDonald formed a research team through the University of Ottawa which obtained funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to conduct qualitative research about transmasculine individuals' experiences of pregnancy, birthing, and feeding their newborns. The group's research paper, \\"Transmasculine individuals‚Äô experiences with lactation, chestfeeding, and gender identity: a qualitative study,\\" contains the first known use of the word \\"chestfeeding\\" in the title of an academic paper, which is a term preferred by some transmasculine individuals to describe their lactation and nursing relationship. The paper is in the top 1% of the most-viewed academic research papers of all time. MacDonald says ‚ÄúThere is this assumption that goes along with the ‚Äòborn in the wrong body‚Äô narrative, that if you are a trans guy you would want a hysterectomy and never use your body to carry a pregnancy.‚Äù He noted that none of the participants' surgeons discussed the potential for future chestfeeding before performing top surgery, and that ‚Äúthe range of experiences and showing more nuance, more complexity, about transgender lives is what is most important in this study.\\" =Community organization= In 2012, MacDonald founded the international support group, \\"Birthing and Breast or Chestfeeding Trans People and Allies\\". The group currently has over 1700 members. =Midwifery care for trans clients= In 2015, several commentators claimed that MacDonald, who was attended by midwives during his pregnancies, had forced the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) to stop using gendered language such as \\"mothers\\" and \\"pregnant women.\\" However, Snopes reported that while MANA did change some of the language in their core materials to clarify they welcomed transgender and cisgender clients in their scope of practice, those decisions were based on their own standards of care, inclusion, and position on gender identity, and not due to pressure from MacDonald or any other trans people. Following MANA's announcement, a group of midwives penned an open letter to MANA protesting what they viewed as \\"the erasure of women from the language of birth.\\" MacDonald wrote a response in the Huffington Post saying that \\"trans, genderqueer and intersex people have been giving birth for as long as women-identified people have\\" and \\"it is possible to be inclusive.\\" Several other associations of midwives subsequently issued statements supportive of MANA and gender nonconforming clients. Works MacDonald has written for The Guardian, The Advocate, the Huffington Post, Out Magazine and This Magazine. He is a public speaker about transgender people and reproductive health, including lactation. He is first author on the first peer-reviewed medical research article on the subject of transmasculine infant chestfeeding. MacDonald is the author of a tip sheet for volunteer leaders who are providing support to transgender, transsexual, and genderfluid individuals who wish to nurse their babies and was profiled in La Leche League International's magazine, Breastfeeding Today. MacDonald's 2016 biography, \\"Where's the Mother? Stories from a Transgender Dad,\\" has been added to the required reading list for Doula Trainings International, who commented that the book is \\"eye-opening for new and seasoned doulas alike.\\" It was reviewed by Publishers Weekly as \\"frank, clever, and easy to process ... a refreshing and insightful narrative.\\" The work has also received coverage in The New York Times, The Guardian, The Toronto Star, Buzzfeed, Gay Star News, Metro UK, The Advocate, Rewire, and on the Canadian Television Network's national newscast.  Politics  MacDonald was the Liberal Party candidate for Provencher in the 2019 Canadian federal election, running under his legal name, Trevor Kirczenow. He is the first openly transgender candidate to have been nominated by a major Canadian political party.

The country has competed in every Summer Paralympics since then, and has never participated in a Winter Paralympics. As of these Paralympics, the country has never medalled.  Disability classifications  Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

Laki is based in Australia, but both of his parents are from Samoa. His representation for Samoa came about because of a relationship developed with the Samoans by Athletics Australia. Laki has cerebral palsy, and went to Rio when he was a year 12 student at Hampton Park Secondary College. He prepared for the Paralympics by training for three hours per day at the track three times a week and the gym three times a week. Laki threw a personal best distance of 33.53 meters. He placed 12th in the competition out of the 12 participants. Maggie Aiono received a wildcard spot to compete in the discus event. Her left foot was amputated after a car accident in 1994, and she uses a prosthetic. The Paralympic Committee also gave Aiono a new prothesis for walking and one specially for discus throwing. Aiono used to do shotput, but changed to discus a couple of months before the Paralympics. She received her new prosthetic leg just before arriving at Rio.

Upon being notified of her acceptance, Binti runs away from home and boards a transport ship to Oomza Uni. While in transit, the ship is hijacked by the Meduse, a jellyfish-like alien species that was previously at war with the Khoush, another human ethnic group. After the Meduse murder all other inhabitants of the ship, Binti retreats into her private living quarters. She subsequently discovers that a piece of ancient technology she had brought with her from Earth, referred to as her edan, enables direct communication with the Meduse, and that her otjize, a type of mixed clay made from the soil of her homeland, has healing properties when applied to the tentacles of the Meduse. She makes a friend in one of the younger, more hot-headed Meduse, named Okwu, and subsequently brokers a tentative truce between herself and the hijackers, a truce that entails Binti's profound physical transformation.

It has approximately the size of a 140m by 100m rectangle, with its longer axis oriented NW-SE. History This vast square dates back to the creation of Sniadecki Street, after the second half of the 19th century. It has always kept its original functions, as a marketplace, hence its original name Elisabethmarkt, after Elisabeth Stra√üe, original name of Sniadecki Street. The area is roughly depicted on an 1857 map of Bromberg,1857 Plan_von_Bromberg_u_Umgegend_Berlin 1857 but earliest documented reference appears in the 1870s, with a mention in the 1872 city address book.

In 1910, the edifice moved to the hands of Carl Rose, a famous architect in Bromberg living on Danzigerstra√üe 29. The renovated corner house displays several architectural details, characteristic of Eclecticism. One can underline in particular: * the corner tower, with a large balustrade-corbel featured balcony, topped by a tented roof cupola ; * bay windows on each facade, with loggias, columns and a pediment showing a floral decorated tympanum; * round pediments on the first floor, with floral ornament.

First owners were: \\\\- August G√ºnther (No.13 and 15), a wood trader, living at No.13; \\\\- Adolf R√∂hr (No.17) a restaurateur, who ran his business at the same address. Today, the place still houses a restaurant. The architect Karl Bergner realized these buildings with the same pattern in mind. No.13 and 15 mirrored each other in perfect symmetry: only some ornamentation details differ. One can appreciate the large gates with a round glass transom light, crowned with a stylish motif and the pedimented first floor windows. No.13 facade retains bit more architectural details, such as additional head figures, and a left part of the elevation with richer decoration (pilasters, stucco ornaments). No.17 breaks the symmetry, with thicker bossage lines on the ground level and the absence of architectural details present at No.13 and 15. Still noticeable is the main gate with a transom light, flanked by pilasters topped by floral and puttoes motif.

The facade is asymmetrical, the only bay window is unbalanced, with quarter circle wrought-iron balconies flanking its left side. Both balconies have a bear cub holding a shield that stands in the corner: it is a reminder of the past activity of a metal craftwork company in the district. A elaborate frieze runs between first and second level, and two windows are topped with triangular pediments: the one on the right side is adorned with a bas-relief of bearded male head with a hat. On the top of the facade stands a sundial, neighboured by two finials. At street level, one can notice the grand portal, crowned by a mask of a beast.

The building houses today the Honorary Consul of the Federal Republic of Germany in Bydgoszcz The tenement stands out of the local urban environment with its lean and high features. Due to its late inception (1910s), the building has been erected according to late Art Nouveau canons, thus it catches the eye among late 19th century edifices. The house architecture is underlined on the one hand by long vertical lines without any ornament (art), broken up on the first floor by horizontal bossages, and on the other hand by two massive bay windows and a modest bartizan.

Despite these obstacles, Southwest has built a history of innovative business practices, and has grown to be one of the largest airlines in the United States and one of the largest low-cost carriers worldwide.  Early history  Boeing 737-200 in original livery in 1975 Boeing 727-200 at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in 1984 Boeing 737-500 at Amarillo in 1994 Boeing 737-700 at McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas in 2008 Southwest Airlines began with the March 15, 1967, incorporation of Air Southwest Co. by Lamar Muse, Rollin King and Herb Kelleher to fly within the state of Texas. Kelleher asserted that by staying within Texas, price controls and market regulations imposed by the federal Civil Aeronautics Board would not apply, and the airline could undercut competitors' prices. Three airlines (Braniff, Trans-Texas Airways and Continental Airlines) started legal action that took three years to resolve. Air Southwest prevailed in 1970 when the Texas Supreme Court upheld Air Southwest's right to fly within Texas.Original Court Decision Upheld, Texas International Airlines, Inc., Petitioner, v. Civil Aeronautics Board Respondent, Southwest Airlines Company, Intervenor Braniff Airways, Inc., Petitioner, v. Civil Aeronautics Board, Respondent, Southwest Airlines Company, Intervenor, 473 F.2d 1150 (United States Court of Appeals, Dec 11, 1972) The Texas decision became final on December 7, 1970, when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case without comment,Certiorari denied, 400 U.S. 943 (1970) vindicating Kelleher's opinion on the limits of federal market regulation. On March 29, 1971, Air Southwest Co. changed its name to Southwest Airlines Co. with headquarters in Dallas. Southwest began scheduled passenger service on June 18, 1971 on two routes: between Dallas Love Field and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and between Dallas Love Field and San Antonio with three Boeing 737-200s. Service between Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) and Dallas Love Field and between Houston Hobby and San Antonio began on November 14, 1971.http://www.southwest.com, Our History The Official Airline Guide for October 15, 1972 lists 61 flights a week each way between Dallas Love and Houston Hobby, 23 flights a week each way between Dallas Love and San Antonio and 16 flights a week each way between San Antonio and Houston Hobby; no flights operated on Saturdays. Southwest Airlines founder Herb Kelleher studied California-based Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) and used many of PSA's ideas to form the corporate culture at Southwest. Early flights used the same \\"Long Legs And Short Nights\\" theme for stewardesses on board typical Southwest Airlines flights. A committee including the same person who had selected hostesses for Hugh Hefner's Playboy jet selected the first flight attendants, females described as long-legged dancers, majorettes and cheerleaders with \\"unique personalities.\\" Southwest Airlines and Herb Kelleher dressed them in hot pants and go-go boots.Freiberg, Kevin, and Jackie Freiberg. NUTS!. Austin, Texas: Bard Press, 1996. The New York Times wrote in 1971 that Southwest Airlines President Lamar Muse, \\"says frankly‚Äîand repeatedly‚Äîthat Southwest Airlines has been developed from its inception around the ideas that have proven to be successful for Pacific Southwest Airlines.\\" \\"We don't mind being copycats of an operation like that,\\" referring to a visit he and other Southwest executives made to PSA as they assembled their operating plans. PSA welcomed them and even sold them flight and operations training. Muse later wrote that creating the operations manuals for his upstart airline was \\"primarily a cut and paste procedure\\" and it is said that \\"Southwest Airlines copied PSA so completely that you could almost call it a photocopy.\\"Collins, Jim and Morten T. Hansen (2011). Great by Choice. New York: HarperCollins The rest of 1971 and 1972 saw operating losses. One of the four 737s was sold to Frontier Airlines and the proceeds used for payroll- and other expenses. Southwest continued a schedule based on four aircraft but using only three, so the \\"ten minute turn\\" was born and was the standard ground time for many years. Operations from Love Field were a central tenet of Southwest's business model due to its convenient proximity to downtown Dallas. However, years of infighting between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth over Greater Southwest International Airport (GSW) and Love Field had prompted the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) in 1964 to order the cities to build a new joint regional airport. The cities agreed to construct Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), and in 1968, agreements were executed prohibiting the cities from operating competing commercial airports and obligating all existing air carriersThe eight existing 1968 air carriers were American Airlines, Braniff International Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Ozark Air Lines and Texas International Airlines. Allen 1990, p. 1015. at Love and GSW to move to the new airport. Southwest's plans to stay at Love Field ran afoul of the hard- fought agreement to close Love to certified air carriers and redevelop it for general aviation. The airline held firm, asserting that no legal basis existed to close the airport to commercial service, and that they were not bound by an agreement they did not sign. Dallas, Ft. Worth, and the DFW Airport Board sued for a declaratory judgment entitling Dallas to evict Southwest from the airport under the 1964 CAB order, but Southwest argued that the CAB had no authority over flights that did not cross state borders, and in 1973, a federal district court ruled that Southwest's proposed intrastate service fell outside of CAB jurisdiction, and so long as Love Field remained open, the City of Dallas could not preclude Southwest from operating there.http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/371/1015/2133770/ = Wright Amendment = The Wright Amendment of 1979 was a federal law that governed traffic at Dallas Love Field until many restrictions from the amendment were removed in late 2014. It originally limited most nonstop flights to destinations within Texas and neighboring states.Petzinger Jr., Thomas (1995). Hard landing. Three River Press, New York, 594 p. . The limits began to phase out in 1997 and 2005; in 2006, the amendment was repealed, with some restrictions intact until 2014, but added a restriction on the number of gates allowed. The Wright Amendment grew from Southwest's refusal to relocate to DFW. After the Airline Deregulation Act was enacted in 1978, Southwest announced plans to begin interstate service in 1979 with flights to New Orleans, a proposal that was quickly endorsed by federal regulators. However, Texas officials‚Äîparticularly those from Fort Worth‚Äîthought that increased traffic at Love Field could draw flights away from DFW Airport and threaten its financial stability. Consequently, Jim Wright, member of the U.S. House of Representatives serving Fort Worth, sponsored and helped pass an amendment to the International Air Transportation Act of 1979 in Congress that restricted passenger air traffic out of Love Field in the following ways: * Passenger service using full-size mainline airliners could be provided only to airports within Texas and its four neighboring U.S. states: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma. At the time, all existing and planned Southwest routes were contained within this area, so the law had no immediate effect on the airline. * Flights to other states were allowed only on aircraft with 56 seats or fewer, in an attempt to prohibit mainline passenger service beyond the five-state region. * Airlines could not offer connecting flights, through service on another airline, or through ticketing beyond the five-state region. = Network expansion = While the Wright Amendment deterred major airlines from starting (or resuming) service out of Love Field, Southwest quickly expanded its Love Field operation by undercutting the high fares charged by legacy airlines to fly to smaller, underserved airports in the five-state region. Southwest only flew to Dallas Love Field, Houston (IAH, then HOU) and San Antonio until 1975 when it added Harlingen. In 1979 Southwest flew to eleven Texas cities and added its first route out of the state, Houston-New Orleans, on January 25 of that year. In 1980 Southwest expanded north to Tulsa and Oklahoma City and west to Albuquerque; in 1982, north to Kansas City and west to Phoenix, Las Vegas and California. Flights to Denver started in 1983 (and ended in 1986), to Little Rock 1984, to St Louis and Chicago Midway in 1985, to Nashville in 1986 and to Detroit Metro and Birmingham in 1987. Eastward expansion resumed in 1992 with Cleveland and Columbus, then Baltimore in 1993. The Pacific Northwest started in 1994 after the Morris Air acquisition; Tampa and Fort Lauderdale started in January 1996. East to Providence in 1997, Manchester in 1998, and Islip and Raleigh-Durham in 1999. Southwest's only route within California was San Francisco-San Diego until it started Oakland in 1989; in the next few years its capacity on the West Coast ballooned.  1980s‚Äì1990s  Southwest hired its first black pilot, Louis Freeman, in 1980. In 1992, he was named the first black chief pilot of any major U.S. airline. In 1981 Southwest was successfully sued for its then-existing policy of hiring only female flight attendants and ticket agents. Southwest's Houston Pilot Base opened on June 1, 1984, its first crew base outside Dallas. 737-300 in original desert gold livery On November 30, 1984 Southwest took delivery of its first Boeing 737-300. Southwest was a launch customer and in May 2012 was the largest operator of the type. The first 737-300 was dubbed \\"Kitty Hawk.\\" In 1985, Dallas, Ft. Worth, and the DFW Airport Board attempted to block Continental Airlines from Love Field on the grounds that it offered interline through- ticketing, a service prohibited under the Wright Amendment and not offered by Southwest. However, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) ruled that an airline was merely disallowed from through-ticketing flight segments to or from Love Field, and that selling a passenger a separate ticket on a connecting flight at another airport‚Äîa practice known as double ticketing‚Äîwas perfectly legal provided that the airline was not \\"advertising, promoting, or otherwise affirmatively soliciting double ticketing passengers.\\" This ruling benefited Southwest by allowing the sale of connecting tickets from Love Field provided that such tickets were requested by travelers rather than being directly solicited by the airline or its employees. Following this ruling, a sophisticated Southwest passenger could work the system and circumvent the Wright Amendment's restrictions by flying from Dallas to another airport in the five-state region, changing planes, and then flying on a separate ticket to any city Southwest served. Southwest paid US$60.5 million in stock and cash for Muse Air when Muse was on the verge of collapse in 1985. After completing the acquisition, Southwest renamed MuseAir TranStar Airlines. TranStar became a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest and operated as an independent airline. Unwilling to compete in a fare war against Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air, Southwest eventually sold TranStar's assets to Lorenzo in August 1987. Southwest moved into its current headquarters in 1990. The airline had been headquartered at 3300 Love Field Dr, then in the 1820 Regal Row building in Dallas in 1979, by Love Field.World Airline Directory. Flight International. March 20, 1975. \\"503.

April 12, 1990. Retrieved on March 4, 2010. Southwest acquired Morris Air, an airline based in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1993, paying US$134 million in stock. After completing the purchase, Southwest absorbed the capital and routes of Morris Air into Southwest's inventory and service, including Morris' Pacific Northwest destinations not previously served by Southwest. One founder of Morris Air, David Neeleman, worked with Southwest for a short period before leaving to found WestJet and then JetBlue Airways, a competing airline. Boeing 737-700 with blended winglets at Chicago Midway International Airport in original desert gold livery On March 16, 1995 Southwest created its first website. Originally called the \\"Southwest Airlines Home Gate,\\" passengers could view schedules, a route map and company information at Iflyswa.com. Southwest.com was the number one airline website for online revenue, according to PhoCusWright. Nielsen/Netratings also reported that Southwest.com was the largest airline site in terms of unique visitors. In 2006, 70 percent of flight bookings and 73 percent of revenue was generated from bookings on southwest.com. , 69 percent of Southwest passengers checked in for their flights online or at a kiosk. Southwest Airlines gained a reputation for \\"outside the box thinking\\" and proactive risk management, including the use of fuel hedging to insulate against fuel price fluctuation. Some analysts have argued against the style of profit-motivated energy trading Southwest did between 1999 and the early 2000s. They suggested that rather than hedging business risk (such as a hedge on weather to a farmer), Southwest was simply speculating on energy prices, without a formal rationale for doing so. Southwest has enjoyed much positive press (and a strong financial boost) from its energy trading skills. However, while most analysts agree that volatility hedges can be beneficial, speculative hedges are not widely supported as a continuing strategy for profits. In March 1996, after the Dallas City Council unanimously voted to allow construction, the airline began to build a addition to the existing corporate headquarters at a cost of $30 million in 1996 dollars.Lee, Christopher and Terry Maxon. \\"Southwest to announce expansion at Love Field $72 million project would add jobs, but no more flights.\\" The Dallas Morning News.

Retrieved on February 18, 2010. the airline leased two tracts of land, a total of , from the City of Dallas to build a new pilot training facility, a headquarters expansion, and more parking space. A $9.8 million pilot training facility was built on a plot of land owned by the city of Dallas; it was scheduled to be completed in the Spring of 1997. With the new training facility built, the old one would be removed and the company would expand its headquarters building on the training facility site. of headquarters space was added, at a price of $16 million including fixtures, making a total of . The airline also leased from the city of Dallas for more parking; 700 spaces were added to the existing 1,200. After the expansion Southwest had a total leasehold of about , including its headquarters, training facilities and parking. By the end of 1997 the expansion of Love Field facilities and several terminal improvements were expected to cost Southwest $47 million. In 1997, Southwest and Icelandair entered into interline and marketing agreements allowing for joint fares, coordinated schedules, transfer of passenger luggage between the two airlines in Baltimore and a place connecting passengers between several U.S. cities and several European cities. The frequent flyer programs were not included in the agreement.  2000s  =Repealing the Wright Amendment= In 1996, startup carrier Legend Airlines proposed to start long-range flights from Love Field using McDonnell Douglas DC-9s refitted with 56 seats, the maximum allowed under the Wright Amendment. However, the USDOT ruled in September 1996 that the 56-seat restriction applied to the \\"designed capacity\\" of an airliner rather than to the number of seats actually installed, prompting Legend to seek to change the law. By July 1997, Legend had enlisted the help of Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. In October 1997, the United States Senate passed a funding bill that included the Shelby Amendment, allowing unrestricted flights to Alabama, Kansas, and Mississippi and nationwide flights using larger aircraft reconfigured with 56 seats. Southwest did not add flights to the new states, citing a lack of demand. However, other airlines were prompted to challenge Southwest at Love Field; the first was Continental Express, which began flights between Love Field and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston in June 1998, and announced its intention to launch interstate flights once legal and regulatory obstacles were overcome. On April 5, 2000, Legend Airlines inaugurated the first 56-seat long-haul service from Love Field to destinations beyond the Wright and Shelby Amendment regions. By July of 2000, they had been joined by American Airlines, Continental Express and Delta Air Lines regional affiliate Atlantic Southeast Airlines. Industry observers predicted that competing airlines' regional jet service at Love Field would continue, but Southwest‚Äîwhich did not operate 56-seat aircraft‚Äîcould not offer competing service because the Legend-backed Shelby Amendment had left the 56-seat long-haul restriction in place. Boeing 737-700 landing at San Jose International Airport. In late 2004, Southwest began actively seeking the full repeal of the Wright Amendment restrictions. In late 2005, Missouri was added to the list of permissible destination states via a transportation appropriations bill. New service from Love Field to Saint Louis, Missouri and Kansas City, Missouri quickly started in December 2005. At a June 15, 2006, joint press conference held by the city of Dallas, the city of Ft. Worth, Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, the said parties announced a tentative agreement on how the Wright Amendment was to be phased out. Both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives passed Wright- related legislation on September 29, 2006, and it was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 13, 2006. The new law became effective on October 16, 2006, when the FAA Administrator notified Congress that any new aviation operations occurring as a result of the new law could be accommodated without adverse effect to the airspace. Southwest started selling tickets under the new law on October 19, 2006. Highlights of the agreement are the immediate elimination of through-ticketing prohibitions and unrestricted flights to domestic destinations eight years after the legislation takes effect. Because of the agreement, nationwide service became possible for Southwest; the law also defined the maximum number of gates at Love Field. Southwest controlled all but four of the Love Field gates. United Airlines controlled two and American Airlines was initially supposed to operate from the other two, however, because of American's merger with US Airways, it had to give up the two gates at DAL. Virgin America began leasing the two gates from American on October 13, 2014. Southwest remains the dominant passenger airline at Love Field, maintains its headquarters, hangars, training centers and flight simulators adjacent thereto and reflects its ties to Love Field in its winged heart livery and its stock exchange ticker symbol (LUV). =2000‚Äì2009= Flight 1455 in Burbank, California On March 5, 2000, Southwest Airlines Flight 1455, a Boeing 737-3T5, registration N668SW, carrying 137 passengers and 5 crew, overran the runway at Burbank-Glendale- Pasadena Airport, Burbank, California, skidding across a city street and coming to rest at a Chevron gas station. 2 passengers suffered serious injuries, while the captain and 41 passengers suffered minor injuries; the aircraft was badly damaged and was written off. This was the first major accident in the airline's 29-year history. The accident was attributed to pilot error, with the pilots having landed at an excessive airspeed; a contributing factor was air traffic control error. Southwest's codeshare arrangement with Icelandair was terminated when that airline's service from Baltimore to Keflav√≠k International Airport ended in January 2007. Boeing 737-800 touches down at Las Vegas In 2008, Southwest contracted with Pratt and Whitney to supply the proprietary Ecopower water pressure-washing system, which allows Southwest to clean grime and contaminants off engine turbine blades while the aircraft is parked at the gate. Frequent use of the Ecopower system is estimated to improve fuel efficiency by about 1.9%.Southwest Ecopower Press Release June 11, 2008Lunsford, J. Lynn. \\"Airlines Dip Into Hot Water to Save Jet Fuel.\\" Wall Street Journal. June 11, 2008: B1. Southwest paid US$7.5 million to acquire certain assets from bankrupt ATA Airlines in 2008. Southwest's primary reason for making the purchase was to acquire the operating certificate and landing slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport formerly controlled by ATA. While some preferential hiring was indicated at the time of the purchase, the transaction ultimately did not include the purchase of any aircraft, facilities or transfers of employees directly from ATA. At the time of ATA's demise in April 2008, the airline offered over 70 flights a week to Hawaii from Southwest's focus cities in PHX, LAS, LAX and OAK with connections available to many other cities across the United States. The ATA/Southwest codeshare was terminated when ATA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 3, 2008. On March 6, 2008, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors submitted documents to the United States Congress, alleging that Southwest allowed 117 of its aircraft to fly carrying passengers despite the fact that they were \\"not airworthy\\" according to air safety investigators. In some cases the aircraft were allowed to fly for up to 30 months after the inspection deadlines had passed, rendering them unfit to fly. Records indicate that thousands of passengers were flown on aircraft deemed unsafe by federal standards. Southwest declined comment at the time and US Representative James Oberstar advised a hearing would be held. A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700 with blended wingtips departing Denver, CO. On March 12, 2008, Southwest Airlines voluntarily grounded 44 aircraft to check if they needed further inspection. The FAA claimed that Southwest Airlines flew almost 60,000 flights without fuselage inspections taking place. Southwest Airlines faced a $10.2 million fine if found to have violated FAA regulations. There have also been rumors that the FAA knew about Southwest Airlines' violations but decided not to fine the airline because it would disrupt the airline's services. On March 2, 2009, Southwest settled these claims, agreeing to pay the FAA fines of $7.5 million for these safety and maintenance issues. The original fine of $30.2 million ‚Äì a sum that would have been the largest fine in the agency's history ‚Äì was lowered after a year of negotiations. The FAA gave Southwest two years in which to pay the fine. On July 8, 2008, Southwest Airlines signed a codeshare agreement with WestJet of Canada, giving the two airlines the ability to sell seats on each other's flights. Originally, the partnership was to be finalized by late 2009, but had been postponed due to economic conditions. On April 16, 2010, Southwest and WestJet airlines amicably agreed to terminate the implementation of a codeshare agreement between the two airlines. On July 30, 2009, Southwest Airlines made a $113.6 million bid for bankrupt Frontier Airlines Holdings, the parent company of Frontier Airlines. Southwest planned to initially operate Frontier as a stand-alone carrier, eventually absorbing the airline and replacing Frontier's aircraft with Boeing 737s. Less than one month after submitting its bid, Southwest learned on August 14 that it had lost the initial bidding to Republic Airways Holdings and elected not to counter or pursue the deal further. Southwest stated that its requirement for pilots' unions at both companies to reach a negotiated (not arbitrated) agreement as a condition of acquisition was a key factor in its abandonment of its bid. Southwest signed its second international codeshare agreement on November 10, 2008, with Mexican low-cost carrier Volaris. The agreement allowed Southwest to sell tickets on Volaris flights. On August 26, 2009 the FAA investigated Southwest for installing improper parts on about 10% of its jets. The work was performed by an outside maintenance company. The FAA stated that the parts do not present a safety danger, but the airline was given until December 24, 2009 to replace the parts with those approved by the FAA.  2010s  = AirTran Airways acquisition = Boeing 737-700 landing at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport Southwest Airlines first announced the acquisition on September 27, 2010 and received final approval from the United States Department of Justice on April 27, 2011. On May 2, 2011, Southwest Airlines completed the acquisition of AirTran Airways by purchasing all of the outstanding common stock, corporate identity and operating assets of AirTran Holdings, Inc., the former parent company of AirTran Airways. Southwest Airlines estimates the transaction's value at $3.2 billion and expects onetime costs to integrate the two airlines of $500 million, with cost synergies of approximately $400 million annually. The greatest impact on Southwest, access to Atlanta, international service and the addition of landing slots at New York-LaGuardia Airport and Washington-Reagan Airport. Southwest obtained a single operating certificate (SOC) from the United States Federal Aviation Administration on March 1, 2012, but the airline was not fully integrated until AirTran had its last flight on December 28, 2014. An entity called Guadeloupe Holdings was formed by Southwest to act as a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines and holding company for AirTran's operations and assets. Southwest's organized labor groups ceded contractual \\"scope\\" provisions pending acceptable negotiated seniority integration agreements. Southwest transitioned aircraft, routes and employees from AirTran to Southwest on a one-by-one basis until all parts of AirTran were integrated to Southwest. The purchase added 25 additional destinations previously not served by Southwest including cities in the Caribbean and Atlanta, Georgia, an AirTran hub and at the time, the largest U.S. city not served by Southwest. On October 10, 2011, USA Today reported that Southwest would work to no longer bank flights in Atlanta as AirTran did. On February 14, 2013, Southwest began codesharing with AirTran. It took the first step on January 26, 2013 by launching shared itineraries in five markets. Southwest continued to launch shared itineraries with 39 more markets beginning February 25, 2013. In April 2013, shared itineraries were expanded to all Southwest and AirTran cities (domestic and international). The airlines were fully integrated on December 29, 2014. = 2010‚Äì2019 = Southwest 737-700 on final at LAX For the tenth year in a row, Fortune magazine recognized Southwest Airlines in its annual survey of corporate reputations. Among all industries in 2004, Fortune has listed Southwest Airlines as number three among America's Top Ten most admired corporations. On December 13, 2011, Southwest placed a firm order for 150 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, becoming the launch customer for the type. The first 737 MAX Aircraft was delivered to Southwest on August 29, 2017, with their first revenue service began on October 1. In January 2012, Southwest Airlines expressed interest in serving Mexican- and South American destinations out of Houston's William P. Hobby Airport.Gutierrez, Gabe. \\"Southwest Airlines considers international flights from Hobby .\\" KHOU. January 26, 2012. Retrieved on January 27, 2012. On May 30, 2012 Houston's city council approved Southwest's request for international flights from Hobby. Southwest agreed to invest at least $100 million to cover all costs tied to the Hobby upgrade, which included designing and building five new gates and a customs facility. Construction at Hobby took two years, with international flights beginning in October 2015. On April 11, 2012, Southwest introduced the 737-800 to the fleet. It seats 175 passengers as compared to the regular 143-seater 737-700. The first 737-800 was called \\"Warrior One\\" in salute of the Southwest Employees‚Äô Warrior Spirit. On February 22, 2013, the connecting agreement with Volaris was terminated. It was said to be mutual between the airlines. Most industry experts believe that the expansion of the subsidiary of Southwest, AirTran Airways, into more Mexican markets, was a main reason for the termination of the agreement. On May 5, 2014, Southwest announced that it had chosen Amadeus IT Group to replace its current domestic reservation system. Southwest already operated its international reservation system with Amadeus. The new domestic reservation system was expected to take a few years to be fully implemented. When completed, Southwest will operate one reservation system by Amadeus. In September 2014, Southwest introduced new branding, including a new livery and logo. On October 13, 2014, the Wright Amendment restrictions at Dallas Love Field were repealed and Southwest expanded service at Love Field to include cities outside the previous location restrictions. Throughout 2014, Southwest expanded service at Reagan-National in Washington D.C. and LaGuardia Airport in New York City through slot acquisitions from the American Airlines/US Airways merger. On June 10, 2016, Southwest received approval to begin flights to Cuba. Southwest was one of six airlines chosen by the USDOT to commence scheduled service to Cuba. Southwest launched service from Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìHollywood International Airport to Varadero, Cuba and Santa Clara, Cuba. In July 2016, an operational outage caused by technology problems cancelled hundreds of Southwest flights, stranding tens of thousands of passengers and many aircrew. On April 17, 2018, Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, one person was killed after an engine failure on a Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas. The engine exploded on the Boeing 737-700 and sent shrapnel flying back towards the passenger window, breaking it.The passenger was partially sucked out through the broken window as an uncontrolled decompression ensued. While other passengers managed to pull the passenger out of the window, she ultimately died from her injuries. This death was the first in-flight fatality due to an accident in the history of Southwest. On March 13, 2019, the FAA grounded all 737 MAX aircraft following the discovery of evidence suggesting a common cause for the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019. The 737 MAX 8 constituted about 5 percent of the Southwest fleet at the time, and the airline offered to rebook travelers' previously scheduled MAX 8 flights on other aircraft without charging additional fees or fare differences. On October 17, 2019, the airline stated that it was expecting the MAX 8 to remain grounded until at least February 8, 2020, forcing the preemptive cancellation of roughly 175 flights per weekday. In June 2019, Captain Bryan Knight flew his dad, Colonel Roy A. Knight, home to Dallas Love Field. 52 years ago, Colonel Knight left Love Field to serve in the Vietnam War, but four months later, he was shot down over Laos. At the time when his son said goodbye to him, he was five years old. His body was recovered, and was flown from Laos to California. There, Southwest flight 1220, bound for Dallas, Texas, brought him home. When Colonel Knight arrived, he was given full military honors. 2020s =2020‚Äìpresent= In January 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported the United States Department of Transportation was working on an investigation that found Southwest flew more than 17 million passengers on planes with unconfirmed maintenance records over two years and that the FAA had allowed Southwest to fly aircraft with unresolved safety concerns.Southwest Flew Millions on Jets With Unconfirmed Maintenance Records, Government Report Says In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on Southwest operations, as a 92% drop in United States air travel compared to March 2019 prompted the airline to cancel 1,500 daily flights constituting about 40% of its schedule. In March 2020, Southwest Airlines had stored 50 737-700 aircraft at Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California, adding to the 34 grounded 737 MAX jets already in storage, and CEO Gary C. Kelly stated that more aircraft may yet be parked. By 7 April, it became clear that the usual summer travel increase was being adversely affected, and the airline suspended close to 50% of it flight schedule through 27 June. On 14 April, Southwest finalized a deal to receive congressional bailout funding consisting of $2.3 billion in grants and a $1 billion low-interest loan. In April 2020, Southwest suspended relatively fewer flights than other major airlines, becoming the world's largest airline measured by operational seat capacity. That same day, Kelly warned employees that \\"if things don‚Äôt change dramatically over the May‚ÄìJune‚ÄìJuly time periods, we‚Äôll have to prepare ourselves for a drastically smaller airline.\\" By 28 April, Southwest had parked 350 of its 742 aircraft, negotiated the delay of many anticipated Boeing 737 MAX deliveries, and was reporting daily losses of at least US$30 million. In July 2020, around one-third of Southwest's employees had expressed interest taking early retirement or long-term leave, and the company launched voluntary separation and extended time off programs. A total of over 16,800 employees, 24% of whom were pilots and 33% flight attendants, signed up for the programs. On 5 October 2020, CEO Kelly announced pay cuts of 10% for non-union employees and 20% for senior management starting 1 January 2021 to avert furloughs later in 2021, and stated that Southwest intended to negotiate with its pilot and flight attendant unions for similar cuts, although union spokespersons expressed opposition.

The titles to his pieces are typically lengthy, stream-of-consciousness narratives that suggest the folk or rural lifestyle. These are intended to add another dimension to the artwork. His work has received a notable response over his decades-long career, especially since he is regarded as ‚Äúa master at reminding us that within the events we take for granted are moments of never-ending mystery and wonder.‚Äù Earl continues to live in Lakeview, Ohio with his wife, Fairlie. Education and career While growing up in his hometown of Uniopolis, Ohio, Earl became inspired by his high school art teacher, Darvin Luginbuhl. He earned his BA at Bluffton College in Ohio in 1956, and then taught art in high schools until he earned his MA in art education at The Ohio State University in 1964. 1963 to 1972 became a time of inspiration and exploration for Earl, as he worked in art education and ceramics at the Toledo Museum of Art and Design. He was interested in making and studying historical porcelain figurines, and by the early 1970s Earl‚Äôs ‚Äúwhimsical‚Äù pieces ‚Äúhad transformed the European tradition into a thoroughly modern and American idiom.‚Äù From 1972-1978, Earl was an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, and in 1974 he and colleague Tom DaLousa were two of the first residents of the John Michael Kohler Arts Center‚Äôs Arts/Industry residency program. By the end of the decade, Earl was creating shockingly real (and in some cases, surreal) works of art. After having one of his porcelain sculptures selected into Objects USA, a touring national exhibition from 1969-1971 organized by SC Johnson and Son, Inc. (Racine, WI), Earl‚Äôs work began to gain recognition. He soon was awarded a solo exhibition the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City (now the Museum of Arts and Design), and his work was featured in the only craft magazine of the time, Craft Horizons (now American Craft). From 1978 onward, Earl has gone on to work full-time as a studio artist in his home of Lakeview, Ohio. In 1985 Lee Nordness published ‚ÄúThe Genesis and Triumphant Survival of an Underground Ohio Artist‚Äù about Earl‚Äôs life and work, one of the first books written solely about a craft artist. Earl has continued to present his work in countless group and solo exhibitions, and is featured in many prominent permanent collections nationally. Artist's Statements \\"The usual comment I get on my work is that somebody likes it. I like to know that people like it. It is then telling me I haven't made a mistake. My work is directed toward selling on the art market. If people don't like it, then it doesn't sell. As far as I'm concerned, there is no reason to make anything that doesn't sell, because I don't have any need to express myself.

The formation is crops out in the Magallanes Region in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego of Chile, the Santa Cruz Province of southern Argentina, and in the subsurface of the Malvinas Basin offshore Argentina and the Falkland Islands.  Description  The bulk of the formation originates from silicic pyroclastic material during a period of bimodal volcanism in Rocas Verdes Basin, a rift basin.Fildani, Andrea, Romans, B.W., Fosdick, J.C., Crane, W.H., and Hubbard, S.M.

The Tob√≠fera Formation is grouped together with other formations of similar age in Patagonia in the Chon Aike Province an extraordinarily large province of silicic volcanism. Except for some western and southern exposures most of the formation is buried and known only from boreholes in the Magallanes and Malvinas Basins. The formation is equivalent to El Quemado and Iba√±ez Formations. Tob√≠fera Formation has an up to thick Basal Clastic Complex, a sub-unit made up of conglomerate and sandstone. Tob√≠fera Formation unconformably overlies metamorphic and igneous basement complexes of Cambrian age.  Deformation and metamorphism  Much of the formation is folded and faulted as consequence of the Andean orogeny. At √öltima Esperanza Province the formation metamorphosed first under greenschist facies and then under prehnite-pumpellyite facies conditions. Some rhyolites of Tob√≠fera Formation were incorporated into Cordillera Darwin Metamorphic Complex. The incorporation of part of Tob√≠fera Formation in the metamorphic complex was accompanied by deformation and metamorphism and occurred in the context of the Andean orogeny in the Cretaceous.

He succeeded his father Prithvi-Varman as the ruler of the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). He revived the Chandela glory by subduing the neighbouring kingdoms, and commissioned several tanks and temples.  Military career  The inscriptions of Madanavarman's successors describe his military achievements using conventional praises, but do not provide any specific details. The Baghari inscription of Paramardi boasts that Madanavarman scattered his enemies with his sword, just like the warrior-deity Indra cut off the wings of the mountains and killed the Vala demon. It further states that his enemies saw his red sword as they moved rapidly towards their own destruction, just as Rahu comes in contact with a newly-arisen sun. It also describes the pitiful condition of his enemies' wives, as they tearfully talked to their pet parrots with no hopes of their husbands' return from the battlefield. = Relations with the neighbours = The Mau inscription of Madanavarman's minister Gadadhara states that the minister helped the Chandela king subdue all other kings. It claims that the Chedi king fled on listening Madanavarman's name, the king of Kashi remained friendly to him out of fear, the arrogant king of Malava was quickly exterminated, and the other kings enjoyed supreme comfort by paying homage to him. While these are obvious exaggerations by a court poet, it appears that Madanavarman was able to exert political influence over these rulers. * The Chedi king can be identified with the Tripuri Kalachuri king Gaya-Karna. The defeats of his predecessors by the Paramaras and the Gahadavalas had weakened the Kalachuri kingdom. Taking advantage of this situation, Madanavarman may have annexed the northern part of the Baghelkhand region, as suggested by the Panwar hoard of his coins. The inscriptions of Gaya-Karna's successor Narasimha have been discovered in this region, at Lal Pahadi (1158 CE) and Alhaghat (1159 CE). This suggests that the Chandelas could not retain this territory for long. * The king of Malava can be identified with the Paramara king Yashovarman or his son Jayavarman. The Paramaras had been weakened after being defeated by the Gujarat Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja. Madanavarman may have seized this opportunity to capture a part of the Paramara territory. According to the 1134 CE Augasi inscription, Madanavarman was residing at Bhaillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha) bear the Chandela-Paramara border. The Semra inscription of his successor Paramardi also indicates that the Chandelas crossed the Betwa River and annexed a part of the Paramara territory. This region was recaptured by Yashovarman's son Lakshmivarman, as indicated by a 1200 VS (1143-44 CE) inscription. * The king of Kashi can be identified with the Gahadavala ruler Govinda-Chandra, who appears to have maintained friendly relations with the Chandelas. = Conflict with Jayasimha Siddharaja = A Kalanjara inscription states that Madanavarman defeated the Gurjara king in an instant, just like Krishna defeated Kamsa. Gurjara here refers to Gujarat, and its king is identified with the Gujarat Chaulukya ruler Jayasimha Siddharaja. The Chaulukya and the Chandela kingdoms were separated by the Paramara territory, and the defeat of the Paramaras by Jayasimha probably led to a conflict between the two powers. The Prithviraj Raso of Chand Bardai mentions the defeat of a Chaulukya ruler, which seems to corroborate the claim made in the Kalanjara inscription. However, the Gujarat chronicles state that it was Jayasimha who emerged victorious in this conflict. According to the Kumarapala-Charita, Jayasimha defeated the king of Mahoba (that is, Madanavarman). The Kirti-Kaumudi states that Madanavarman paid a tribute to Jayasimha after seeing the fate of ruler of Dhara (the Paramara king). The Kumarapala-Prabandha narrates a similar legend: A bard once told Jayasimha that the Chandela king was a very wise, generous and pleasure-loving ruler, whose court was as splendid as that of Jayasimha. On hearing this, Jayasimha deputed another person to verify this claim. When the claim was confirmed, he marched against the Chandelas. After reaching the outskirts of Mahoba, he sent an emissary, asking Madanavarman to surrender. Madanavarman was busy celebrating the spring festival, and did not take the demand seriously. When the emissary reminded him about the fate of the Paramaras, he derisively asked his minister to make Jayasimha return by paying him some money. Jayasimha received the money, but when he heard about Madanavarman's nonchalance, he refused to return without meeting the Chandela king. He visited the Chandela palace with a large retinue. Only four of his attendants were allowed to accompany him inside the palace, but Madanavarman offered him a warm reception. Consequently, Jayasimha returned to his capital peacefully. According to K. M. Munshi, the above-mentioned legend is \\"fanciful\\", and Jayasimha did not achieve much success against the Chandelas. Historian R. K. Dikshit theorizes that the conflict between Jayasimha and Madanavarman was inconclusive, with both the sides claiming victory. = Other campaigns = A fragmentary Mahoba inscription dated 1240 VS (1183-84 CE) contains a vague reference to wars with Anga, Vanga and Kalinga. These probably refer to Madanavarman's campaign in eastern India.  Extent of the kingdom  Compared to the other Chandela rulers, an unusually large number of coins and inscriptions are available from his reign. The locations of their discoveries and the place names mentioned in the various inscriptions indicate that Madanavarman's kingdom roughly included the Vindhyan region from Kaimur Range in the west to the Bhanrer Range in the east, between the Betwa and the Yamuna rivers. Inscriptions from his reign have been found at Augasi (Banda district), Ajaygarh, Barigar (near Charkhari), Kalanjara, Khajuraho, Mahoba, Mau, and Papaura (Tikamgarh district). The Augasi copper-plate inscription states that it was issued at Bhilsa (Vidisha), which indicates that Bhilsa was also a part of his kingdom. The Barigar (Varidurga) inscription mentions several places which can be identified with parts of the present-day Damoh, Jhansi, and Sagar districts. A coin hoard found at Panwar in Rewa district suggests that the Bagelkhand area was also a part of his kingdom.  Administration  Madanavarman's prime minister was Gadadhara, who had also served his father. The Mau inscription praises Gadadhara for his knowledge of the Vedas and his pious acts, including the construction of a Vishnu temple and a tank near Deddu village. Madanavarman's chief counsellor was a learned Brahmin named Lahada, who was proficient in arts. Madanavarman's senapati (chief general) was Ajayapala, who is mentioned in Paramardi's Semra inscription as the son of senapati Kilhana. His maha-pratihara (chief chamberlain) was Samgrama-Simha, who is mentioned in a Kalanjara inscription. Madanavarman issued gold, silver and copper coins featuring a seated goddess. He also issued copper coins featuring the deity Hanuman. These coins mention his name as Shriman Madana-Varma-Deva.  Public works  According to the Paramala-Raso, Madanavarman commissioned a large number of tanks and temples. He also gifted large amounts of gold, jewels, horses, and elephants to Brahmins. Madanavarman's name is found on the buildings at Ajaygarh and Kalanjara. The ruined Shiva and Vishnu temples located around the lake at Mahoba are ascribed to him. The ruined temple of Madanesha-Sagara-Pura in Ahar (Tikamgarh district) also bears his name. Tanks named \\"Madana-Sagara\\" (or Madan Sagar) after him are located in Mahoba, Jatara and Ahar-Narayanpura area of Tikamgarh district. Temples commissioned by him were once located on the banks of these tanks. Several other places are named after Madanavarman; these include Madanpura in Jhansi district and Madankhera near Mahoba. Several images of Jain tirthankaras from his reign have been found at Ahar, Khajuraho, Mahoba, Papaura and other places.  Personal life  An 1192 CE inscription of Madanavarman, now at Bharat Kala Bhavan, mentions three of his queens: Maharani (chief queen) Valhana-Devi, Rajni Lakhamadevi and Rajni Chaandala devi. According to a Kalanjara inscription, Pratapa-Varman was his younger brother. Madanavarman's son was Yasho-Varman II, and his grandson was Paramardi-Deva. Yasho-Varman either did not rule, or ruled for a very short time. Historical evidence suggests that Madanavarman was succeeded by Paramardi.

The country's participation in Rio marked its debut appearance in the quadrennial event, although it had competed in the Summer Olympics nine times since the 1972 Games. The delegation consisted of a single middle-distance runner, Farhan Adawe, who qualified for the Games by meeting qualification standards in March 2016. He was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony and came ninth overall in his event, the men's 100 metres (T52), which led to his elimination from the Paralympics. Background Somalia had first competed in the Olympic Games at the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany. They participated on nine occasions prior to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, where they made their Summer Paralympics debut in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the exception of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Games in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa earlier in 1976, and the latter because the country joined the United States- led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. The nation also did not compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics, despite participating in the opening ceremony, because of the ongoing famine affecting the country. Somalia was one of six countries to make their first appearance in the Paralympic Games; the others were Aruba, Congo, Malawi, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Togo. The country participated in the Rio Paralympic Games from 7 to 18 September 2016. The Somalia Paralympic Committee sent a single middle- distance runner, Farhan Adawe, after the committee's secretary general Ali Ahmed Mohamud held discussions with Adawe about the opportunity to represent his country of which he accepted. A committee-formed goalball team composed of blind athletes failed to qualify for the Games. Two other Somali nationals competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, but under the citizenships of other countries; they were Abdi Dini, for Canada and Abdi Jama for Great Britain. Adawe was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

Farhan Adawe was the first Somali Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event and was 19 years old at the time of the Games. After the International Paralympic Committee granted Somalia's entry into the Paralympics, they requested that the nation make Adawe go through the routine qualifying procedures for all para-athletes. Adawe was placed in the T52 classification because his legs are unable to support him standing in an upright position and consequently used a wheelchair. He qualified for the Games by meeting qualification standards in an tournament held in Italy in March 2016 where he set a national record time of 18.83 seconds which was 1.67 seconds faster the standard qualifying time for the men's 100 metres (T52). Adawe was drawn in the contest's first heat on 9 September, finishing fifth out of eight competitors, with a time of 18.49 seconds. He placed ahead of Japan's Hirokazu Ueyonabaru (19.35 seconds) but behind Cristian Torres of Colombia (18.23) in a heat led by Gianfranco Iannotta of the United States (17.20 seconds). Adawe finished ninth out of fourteen para-athletes overall but did not advance into the final after being 0.08 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who made the last stage.

Youssouphua Diouf, a javelin thrower, and shot put and discus thrower Daque Diop were the two athletes sent to Rio de Janeiro by Senegal. The delegation failed to win the country's first medal at the Summer Paralympics as its best performance in these Games was Diouf's seventh position in the men's javelin F56-57 event. Background Senegal first entered Paralympic competition at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. They have participated in every Summer Paralympic Games since, making Rio de Janeiro their fourth appearance in a Summer Paralympiad. Senegal had yet to win its first Paralympic medal at the close of the Rio Games. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7‚Äì18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. The nation sent two athletes to compete in the Rio de Janeiro Paralympics: javelin thrower Youssoupha Diouf and shot put and discus thrower Dague Diop.

Disability classifications Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. Athletics Youssoupha Diouf contracted polio when he was a child and has occasionally had to use a wheelchair since because the disease has weakened the muscles in both of his legs. He was 29 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympics and this was his maiden appearance in the multi-sport event. Diouf qualified for the Games by meeting the \\"A\\" qualifying standards because of his fourth place finish in the men's javelin throw at the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in October that year. This was the first time a Senegalese athlete attained automatic qualification for a Paralympic Games. He is classified as F57 by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and competes in a sitting position. Diouf trained at the H2 Dynamic Handysports Lombardia in the city of Milan as part of an agreement between the Senegalese National Paralympic Committee and the Italian sporting authorities to allow his preparation for the Paralympics. He said that he would showcase his success in Senegal in the event he won a medal at the Games. On September 8, Diouf took part in the men's javelin F56‚Äì57 event. He finished seventh out of fourteen athletes, with a throw of 41.83 metres which he recorded on his final try, his best mark of the season. Dague Diop was 35 years old at the time of the Rio Paralympic Games and she was entering her second Summer Paralympics after representing Senegal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics. She is classified as F57 by the IPC and competes in a wheelchair. Diop received a wild card invitation to participate in the Paralympics because of her good performance at the 2015 African Games. With a scholarship from the Senegalese Ministry of Sport, she trained at the Stade L√©opold S√©dar Senghor in Dakar to prepare for the Paralympics. Diop's girlfriend revealed that the athlete's objective was to win a medal in Rio de Janeiro, \\"Every time she went to a tournament, she came back with a distinction. She is determined. I'm sure she will not come back empty handed.\\" She took part in the women's shot put F56‚Äì57 competition with eleven more athletes on 8 September, placing eleventh (and last) out of all the finishing athletes, with a throw of 4.53 metres. Seven days later, Diop partook in the women's discus F56‚Äì57 event along with thirteen more competitors.

She was born with a condition that has impaired the muscle power in both of her knees and is classified as T54. Perrine uses a wheelchair to compete. She qualified for Games because her time of 18.89 seconds at the Berlin Open Grand Prix 2016 was 0.01 seconds below the \\"B\\" qualifying standard for the women's 100 metres T54 event. Her participation at the Berlin Open Grand Prix served as preparation for the Paralympics and she also attended the IPC Athletics Grand Prix Final in London the week after. Perrine set herself the target of lowering her personal best and she said she was confident for her event. On 8 September, she participated in the heats of the women's 100 metres T54, and was assigned to the second heat.

He lost the use of both legs from contracting polio at the age of ten, and races in a wheelchair. He qualified for these Paralympics at an event in Morocco. On 16 September, he competed in the heats of the men's 100 meters T54. Drawn into the first heat, he completed the race with a time of 18.82 seconds, which put him seventh and last in his heat, and therefore unable to advance to the final eight.

This was the nation's third appearance at a Summer Paralympic Games, following their two previous participations at the 2008 Summer Paralympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Gabon sent a sole athlete to represent them at Rio de Janeiro, wheelchair racer Edmond Ngombi. He did not advance from his heat in the men's 100 metres T54 event as he came sixth out of seven competitors and attributed the result to a handlebar problem. Background Gabon first entered Paralympic competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics and have appeared in every Summer Paralympic Games since. Thus, Rio de Janeiro was the country's third time competing at a Summer Paralympiad. The nation has never won a medal at the Paralympic Games. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7‚Äì18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. Gabon was represented by a sole athlete, Edmond Ngombi, a short-distance wheelchair racer. He was accompanied by his coach Guy Ga√©tan Ntoutoume Endenda and international classifier Astride Koumba. Ngombi was selected to be the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony. Disability classifications Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis.

Athletics Edmond Ngombi contracted polio at an early age, and lost the use of both his legs, resulting in him using a wheelchair in competition. He is classified T54 by the International Paralympic Committee. The Rio Summer Paralympics were his second significant international competition, after the 2015 African Games, and he was 39 years old at the time of the Games. To compete at the Games, he received an invitation from the Bipartite Commission because his fastest time of 18.34 at the 2015 African Games was 3.19 seconds slower than the \\"B\\" qualifying standard for his event, the men's 100 metres T54. On 16 September, Ngombi competed in the heats of the men's 100 meters T54. Assigned to compete against seven other athletes in heat one, he completed the race in 18.79 seconds, which put him sixth. Nogmbi failed to qualify for the final since he was 19th overall and only the top eight advanced to that stage of the competition. After the Paralympics, he said his performance was hindered by a handlebar problem on his wheelchair and revealed that he exceeded his expectations. ;Men's Track {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Events !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Final - !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank -align=center align=leftEdmond Ngombi align=left100 m T54 18.79 6 colspan=2Did not advance } See also * Gabon at the 2016 Summer Olympics References Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Para ","title":"Gabon at the 2016 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"51410409","title":"Ethiopia at the 2016 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"51410410","text":"is a Japanese voice actress who is currently affiliated with Stardas 21.

This was the country's second time competing at a Summer Paralympic Games after making its debut at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. Botswana was represented by one athlete, Keatlaretese Mabote, a short-distance sprinter. He competed in one event, the men's 400 metres T12 competition, where he was eliminated in the heat stages because he was third in his heat and only the top two participants in a heat progressed to the semi-finals. Background Botswana made its second Paralympic Games appearance in Rio de Janeiro, with their Paralympic debut occurring twelve years prior at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens. The country did not compete at the 2008 Summer Paralympics because its sole athlete Tshotlego Morama had an injury and the nation withdrew several hours before the 2012 Summer Paralympics because the Botswana National Olympic Committee cancelled its financial support due to financial irregularities.

Athletics Competing for the first time in the Paralympics, Keatlarete Mabote was 26 years old at the time of the 2016 Summer Rio Paralympic Games. He has a visual impairment and is classified as a T12 athlete by the International Paralympic Committee. Mabote attained automatic qualification to the Games because of his performance at the Tunis International Para Athletics Meeting in March 2016 where he won two bronze medals and met the \\"B\\" qualifying standard in athletics. He trained for two weeks in the South African city of Potchefstroom as part of his preparation for the Games. Mabote's training was hindered when his tattered running shoes had no studs equipped and was provided the incorrect studs only a day which were suited to middle-distance runners before his event in Rio de Janeiro. This meant his old running shoes had the new studs fitted to them. In an interview before the Paralympics, Mabote said he was positive about his chances despite the recent death of one of his siblings, \\"I want to be the first Motswana to bring the medal to this country and I have worked so hard for this.\\" On 8 September, he competed in the men's 400 metres T12. Drawn to heat one, Mabote finished third out of four sprinters, with a new personal best time of 51.33 seconds. As only the top two in a heat could progress to the semi-finals, Mabote was eliminated from the competition. He was due to run in the men's 200 metres T12 on 16 September but withdrew because of a hamstring injury he sustained in Germany. ;Men's Track {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Events !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Semifinal !colspan=\\"2\\"Final - !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank -align=center align=leftKeatlaretse Mabote align=left400 m T12 51.33 3 colspan=4Did not advance } See also * Botswana at the 2016 Summer Olympics Notes References Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Para ","title":"Botswana at the 2016 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"51410451","text":"Papua New Guinea competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016.

As Antarctica moved from a place of exploration and conquest to a scientific frontier, women worked to be included in the sciences. The first countries to have female scientists working in Antarctica were the Soviet Union, South Africa and Argentina. Besides exploring and working as scientists, women have also played supportive roles as wives, fund-raisers, publicists, historians, curators and administrators of organizations and services that support Antarctic operations. Many early women on Antarctica were the wives of explorers. Some women worked with Antarctica from afar, crafting policies for a place they had never seen. Women who wished to have larger roles in Antarctica and on the continent itself had to \\"overcome gendered assumptions about the ice and surmount bureaucratic inertia. As women began to break into fields in Antarctica, they found that it could be difficult to compete against men who already had the \\"expeditioner experience\\" needed for permanent science positions. Women who were qualified for expeditions or jobs in Antarctica were less likely to be selected than men, even after a 1995 study by Jane Mocellin showed that women cope better than men with the Antarctic environment.  Historic barriers against inclusion  Mary Byrd Land, named after the wife of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd in 1929. Most early policies and practices, including the construction and creation of Antarctic organizations, were created initially by men. Women were originally excluded from early exploration in Antarctica based on the attitude that women could not handle the extremes in temperature or crisis situations. Vivian Fuchs, who was in charge of the British Antarctic Survey in the 1960s, believed that women couldn't carry heavy equipment and that Antarctic facilities were unsuitable for women. The United States believed for many years that the climate of Antarctic was too harsh for women. Antarctica was seen by many men as a place where men could imagine themselves heroic conquerors. In Western culture, frontier territories are often associated with masculinity. Antarctica itself was envisioned by many male explorers as a \\"virginal woman\\" or \\"monstrous feminine body\\" to be conquered by men. Women were often \\"invoked in terms of place naming and territorial conquest and later even encouraged to have babies in Antarctica.\\" Using women as territorial conquest is probably at its most literal in the way that Argentina and Chile have flown pregnant women to Antarctica to give birth and stake a national claim to the area. Silvia Morella de Palma was the first woman to give birth in Antarctica, delivering 3.4 kg (7 lb 8 oz) Emilio Palma at the Argentine Esperanza base 7 January 1978. Men enjoyed having a space that was free of women and which in the late 1940s \\"allowed them to continue the kind of male companionship and adventure they had enjoyed during the Second World War.\\" In one news article about Antarctica written in 1958, the writer describes the use of dazzlement: \\"On the womanless continent, the purpose of the dazzlement is not to catch the eye of a flirtatious blonde, but to attract spotters in the event that the explorers become lost in the frozen waste.\\" Men's spaces in Antarctica resisted change. In the 1980s, there was an attempt by men to memorialize the \\"Sistine ceiling\\" of the Weddell hut in Antarctica as an Australian national heritage site of \\"high significance.\\" The \\"Sistine ceiline\\" was covered in 92 different pornographic pinups of women from the 1970s and 1980s. This represented a \\"male's only club\\" in which participants believed women would spoil the \\"purity of a homosocial work--and play--environment.\\" In 1983, the San Bernardino County Sun newspaper published an article about Antarctica stating that it \\"is still one of the last macho redoubts, where men are men and women are superfluous.\\" One scientist, Lyle McGinnis, who had been going to Antarctica since 1957 resented women in the field, saying that \\"men never grouse,\\" but he believed that women complained and needed \\"comfort.\\" Not all men felt that way. Other men felt that women's presence made life in Antarctica better and one male engineer stated that without women around, \\"men are pigs.\\" Sociologist Charles Moskos stated that as more women are introduced to a group, there is less aggression and a \\"more civil culture develops.\\" Many of the careers in Antarctica are in the sciences, and women faced barriers there as well. As women attempted to work in science, arguments using biological determinism, evolutionary psychology and popular notions of neurobiology were used as excuses as to why there were fewer women in the sciences. These arguments described how \\"women are ill-adapted on evolutionary grounds for science and the competitive environment of the laboratory.\\" Some women described feeling that they were \\"a bit of a joke\\" working in Antarctica, and felt that men regarded them as incapable. Antarctic exploration and science research was often facilitated by national navies, who often did not want women on their ships. The United States Navy used the excuse that \\"sanitation facilities were too primitive\\" on Antarctica as an excuse to bar women. The U.S. Navy also considered Antarctica a \\"male-only bastion.\\" Admiral George Dufek said in 1956 that \\"women would join American Teams in the Antarctic over his dead body.\\" He also believed that women's presence on Antarctica \\"would wreck men's illusions of being heroes and frontiersmen.\\" Military groups also were worried about \\"sexual misconduct.\\" As women began to try to become part of Antarctic exploration and research, change was slow. An article run in The Daily Herald newspaper of Chicago in 1974 described women finally coming to Antarctica as integrating the \\"land with a definite feminine touch.\\" The article describes women's perfumed smells, ways of entertaining guests on Antarctica and the \\"dainty feet\\" of Caroline Mikkelsen. Eventually, however, both the \\"presence and impact of female Antarctic researchers has increased rapidly.\\"  Early women involved in Antarctica  Ingrid Christensen (left) and Mathilde Wegger on a voyage in 1931. Oral records from Oceania indicate that women explorers, Ui-te-rangiora around 650 CE and Te Ara-tanga-nuku in 1000 CE, may have traveled to the Antarctic regions. The first Western woman to visit the Antarctic region was Louise S√©guin, who sailed on the Roland with Yves Joseph de Kerguelen in 1773. In the early twentieth century, women were interested in going to Antarctica. When Ernest Shackleton advertised his 1914 Antarctic expedition, three women wrote to him, requesting to join, though the women never became part of the journey. In 1919, newspapers reported that women wanted to go to Antarctica, writing that \\"several women were anxious to join, but their applications were refused.\\" Later, in 1929, twenty-five women applied to the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE), and were also rejected. When a British Antarctic Expedition was proposed in 1937, 1,300 women applied to join. None of those 1,300 went to the frozen continent. Women who were wives of explorers who were left behind \\"endured years of loneliness and anxiety.\\" Women like Kathleen Scott raised money for their husbands' journeys. The first women involved in exploration of Antarctica were wives and companions of male travelers and explorers. Women accompanied men as \\"whaling wives\\" to Antarctic waters. The first women to see the continent of Antarctica was Norwegian Ingrid Christensen and her companion, Mathilde Wegger, both of whom were traveling with Christensen's husband. The first woman to step onto the land of Antarctica, an island, was Caroline Mikkelsen in 1935. Mikkelsen only briefly went ashore, and was also there with her husband. Later, after her husband died, Mikkelsen remarried and didn't talk about her experience in Antarctica in order \\"to spare his feelings.\\" Christensen went back to Antarctica three times after she first glimpsed the land. She eventually landed at Scullin Monolith, becoming the first woman to set foot on the Antarctic mainland, followed by her daughter, Augusta Sofie Christensen, and two other women: Lillemor Rachlew, and Solveig Wider√∏e.Bogen, H. (1957). Main events in the history of Antarctic exploration. Sandefjord: Norwegian Whaling Gazette, page 85 Because the women believed the landing wasn't an actual \\"first,\\" they didn't make much of their accomplishment. In the years of 1946 and 1947, Jackie Ronne and Jennie Darlington were the first women to spend the year in Antarctica. When Ronne and Darlington decided to accompany their husbands in 1946 to Antarctica, men on the expedition \\"signed a petition trying to stop it happening.\\" Ronne worked as the mission's \\"recorder.\\" Ronne and Darlington both wrote about their experiences on the ice, and in the case of Darlington's book, about how conflict between team members also \\"strained relations between the two women.\\" One of the ways that Darlington tried to fit in with the men of the group was to make herself as \\"inconspicuous within the group as possible.\\" One man, first seeing Darlington arrive at the Antarctic base, \\"fled in fright, thinking that he'd gone mad.\\" Both women, upon returning from Antarctica downplayed their own roles, letting \\"their husbands take most of the honour.\\" In 1948, the British diplomat, Margaret Anstee, was involved in the Falkland Islands Dependency Survey (FIDS) and helped make policy for the program.  Further exploration and science  Irene Bernasconi and others in 1968 at Esperanza Base Women scientists first began researching Antarctica from ships. The first woman scientist, Maria V. Klenova of the Soviet Union, worked on the ships Ob and Lena just off the Antarctic coastline in 1955 to 1956. Klenova's work helped create the first Antarctic atlas. Women served on Soviet Union ships going to Antarctica after 1963. The first women to visit a US station and the first to fly to Antarctica were Pat Hepinstall and Ruth Kelley, Pan Am flight attendants, who spent four hours on the ground at the McMurdo Station on October 15, 1957. Often women going to Antarctica had to be approved in both official and unofficial ways. An early candidate for becoming one of the first women scientists to go to Antarctica was geologist Dawn Rodley, who had been approved of not only by the expedition sponsor, Colin Bull, but also by the wives of the male team-members. Rodley was set to go in 1958, but the United States Navy, who were in charge of Operation Deep Freeze, refused to take her to Antarctica. The Navy decided that sending a four-woman team would be acceptable, and Bull began to build a team including Lois Jones, Kay Lindsay, Eileen McSaveney and Terry Tickhill. These four women were part of the group who became the first women to visit the South Pole. Jones's team worked mainly in Wright Valley. After their return, Bull found that several of his male friends resented the addition of women and even called him a \\"traitor\\". The first United States all-female team was led by Jones in 1969. Her team, which included the first women to set foot on the South Pole, were used by the navy as a publicity stunt, \\"paraded around\\" and called \\"Powderpuff explorers\\". The first United States woman to step into in the Antarctic interior in 1970 was engineer Irene C Peden, who also faced various barriers to her working on the continent. Peden describes how a \\"mythology had been created about the women who'd gone to the coast -- that they had been a problem,\\" and that since they had not published their work within the year, they were \\"heavily criticized.\\" Men in the Navy in charge of approving her trip to Antarctica were \\"dragging their feet\\", citing that there were not women's bathrooms available and that without another female companion, she would not be allowed to go. The admiral in charge of transportation to Antarctica suggested that Peden was trying to go there for adventure, or to find a husband, rather than for her research. Despite her setbacks, including not receiving critical equipment in Antarctica, Peden's research on the continent was successful. Ursula B. Marvin in Antarctica, 1978‚Äì1979 The first U.S. woman to run an Antarctic research station was Mary Alice McWhinnie, who led the McMurdo Station in 1974 and was accompanied by a nun and biologist, Mary Odile Cahoon. United States women in 1978 were still using equipment and arctic clothing designed for men, although \\"officials said that problem is being quickly remedied.\\" American Ann Peoples became the manager of the Berg Field Center in 1986, becoming the first woman to serve in a \\"significant leadership role\\". British women had similar problems to the Americans. The director of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) from 1959 to 1973 was Vivian Fuchs, who \\"firmly believed that the inclusion of women would disrupt the harmony and scientific productivity of Antarctic stations.\\" British women scientists started working on curating collections as part of the BAS prior to being allowed to visit Antarctica. Women who applied to the BAS were discouraged. A letter from BAS personnel sent to a woman who applied in the 1960s read, \\"Women wouldn't like it in Antarctica as there are no shops and no hairdresser.\\" The first BAS woman to go to Antarctica was Janet Thomson in 1983 who described the ban on women as a \\"rather improper segregation.\\" Women were still effectively barred from using UK bases and logistics in 1987. Women didn't winter-over at the Halley Research Station until 1996, forty years after the British station was established. Argentina sent four women scientists ‚Äì biologist Irene Bernasconi, bacteriologist Maria Adela Caria, biologist Elena Martinez Fontes and algae expert Carmen Pujals ‚Äì to Antarctica in 1969. Later, in 1978, Argentina sent a pregnant woman, Silvia Morello de Palma, to the Esperanza Base to give birth and to \\"use the baby to stake [their] territorial claims\\" to Antarctica. Once Australia opened up travel to Antarctica to women, Elizabeth Chipman, who first worked as a typist at Casey Station in 1976, chronicled all of the women to travel there up to 1984. Chipman worked to find the names of all women who had ever been to or even near Antarctica and eventually donated 19 folio boxes of her research to the National Library of Australia.  Women gain ground  In-Young Ahn at King Sejong Station in Antarctica in 2015. The National Science Foundation (NSF) started long-range planning in 1978, looking towards facilities that could accommodate a population made up of 25% women. In the 1979-1980 season, there were only 43 women on the continent. By 1981, there were nearly one woman for every ten men in Antarctica. In 1983, the ratio was back to 20 men for every woman. In the 1980s, Susan Solomon's research in Antarctica on the ozone layer and the \\"ozone hole\\" causes her to gain \\"fame and acclaim.\\" In Spain, Josefina Castellv√≠, helped coordinate and also participated in her country's expedition to Antarctica in 1984. Later, after a Spanish base was constructed in 1988, Castellv√≠ was put in charge after the leader, Antoni Ballester had a stroke. The first female station leader on Antarctica was Australian, Diana Patterson, head of Mawson Station in 1989. The first all-female over-wintering group is from Germany and spends the 1990-1991 winter at Georg von Neumayer, with the first German female station leader and medical doctor Monika Puskeppeleit. In 1991 In-Young Ahn is the first female leader of an Asian research station (King Sejong Station), and the first South Korean woman to step onto Antarctica. There were approximately 180 women in Antarctica in the 1990-1991 season. Women from several different countries were regularly members of over- wintering teams by 1992. The first all-women expedition reached the South Pole in 1993. Diana Patterson, the first female station leader on Antarctica, saw a change happening in 1995. She felt that many of the sexist views of the past had given way so that women were judged not by the fact that they were women, but \\"by how well you did your job.\\" Social scientist, Robin Burns, studied the social structures of Antarctica in the 1995-1996 season. She found that while many earlier women struggled, in 1995, there was more acceptance of women in Antarctica. Also by the mid 1990s, one of the station managers, Ann Peoples, felt that a tipping point had been reached and women on Antarctica became more normalized. There were still men in Antarctica who were not afraid to voice their opinion that women should not \\"be on the ice,\\" but many others enjoyed having \\"women as colleagues and friends.\\" Women around this time began to feel like it was \\"taken for granted now that women go to the Antarctic.\\" Studies done in the early 2000s showed that women's inclusion in Antarctic groups were beneficial overall. In the early 2000s, Robin Burns has found that female scientists who enjoyed their experience in Antarctica were ones who were able to finish their scientific work, to see through the project into completion.  Recent history  Women celebrate at 2013 Icestock in Antarctica. American Lynne Cox swam a mile in Antarctic water in 2003. In 2005, writer Gretchen Legler describes how there were many more women in Antarctica that year and that some were lesbians. International Women's Day in 2012 saw more than fifty women celebrating in Antarctica and who made up 70% of the International Antarctic Expedition. In 2013, when the Netherlands opened their first Antarctic Lab, Corina Brussaard was there to help set it up. Homeward Bound, is a 10-year program designed to encourage women's participation in science that planned to send the first large (78 member) all-women expedition to Antarctica in 2016. The first group consisted of 76 women and arrived in Antarctica for three weeks in December 2016. Fabian Dattner and Jess Melbourne-Thomas founded the project and the Dattner Grant is providing funding, with each participant contributing $15,000 to the project. Homeward bound includes businesswomen and scientists who look at climate change and women's leadership. The plan is to create a network of 1,000 women who will become leaders in the sciences. The first voyage departed South America in December 2016 An all-woman team of United Kingdom Army soldiers, called Exercise Ice Maiden, started recruiting members in 2015 to attempt to cross the continent under their own power in 2017. If successful, they will be the first military group of women to do so. Exercise Ice Maiden is meant to study \\"female endurance in extreme conditions.\\" Currently, women make up 55% of membership in the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS). In 2016, nearly a third of all researchers at the South Pole were women. The Australian Antarctic Program (AAP) makes a \\"conscious effort to recruit women.\\" A social media network has recently been created \\"Women in Polar Science\\" it aims to connect women working in Arctic and Antarctic science and provides them with a platform to share an exchange knowledge, experiences and opportunities.  Sexual harassment and sexism  When heavy equipment operator, Julia Uberuaga, first went to Antarctica in the late 70s, early 80s, she recalled that \\"the men stared at her, or leered at her, or otherwise let her know she was unwelcome on the job.\\" Rita Matthews, who went to Antarctica during the same period as Uberuaga said that the \\"men were all over the place. There were some that would never stop going after you.\\" In 1983, Marilyn Woody described living at McMurdo station and said, \\"It makes your head spin, all this attention from all these men.\\" Then she said, \\"You realize you can put a bag over your head and they'll still fall in love with you.\\" Another scientist, Cynthia McFee, had been completely shut out of the \\"male camaraderie\\" at her location and had to deal with loneliness for long periods of time. Martha Kane, the second woman to overwinter at the South Pole, experienced \\"negative pressure\\" by the men with \\"some viewing her as an interloper who had insinuated herself into a male domain.\\" In the 1990s, women experienced stigma in Antarctica. These women were labeled \\"whores\\" for interacting with men and those who did not interact with men were called \\"dykes.\\" In the late 1990s and early 2000s, women felt that Antarctic operations were \\"not at all sympathetic to the needs of mothers, and there is a deep concern lest a pregnant woman give birth in Antarctica.\\" Sexual harassment is still a problem for women working in Antarctica, with many women scientists fielding unwanted sexual advances over and over again. Women continue to be outnumbered in many careers in Antarctica, including fleet operations and trades. Some organizations, such as the Australian Antarctic Division, have created and adopted policies in order to combat sexual harassment and discrimination based on gender. The United States Antarctic Program (USAP) encourages women and minorities to apply.  Women record- breakers  Silvia Morella de Palma was the first woman to give birth in Antarctica, delivering 3.4 kg (7 lb 8 oz) Emilio Palma at the Argentine Esperanza base 7 January 1978. American Lisa Densmore became the first woman to summit Mount Vinson in 1988. In 1993, American Ann Bancroft led the first all woman expedition to the South Pole. Bancroft, and Norwegian Liv Arnesen, were the first women to ski across Antarctica in 2001. Maria Leijerstam became the first person to cycle to the South Pole from the edge of the continent in 2013; she cycled on a recumbent tricycle. Anja Blacha set the record for the longest solo, unsupported, unassisted polar expedition by a woman in 2020.  Honors and awards  In 1975, Eleanor Honnywill became the first woman to be awarded the Fuchs Medal from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). The first woman to receive a Polar Medal was Virginia Fiennes in 1986; she was honored for her work in the Transglobe Expedition. She was also the first woman to \\"winter in both polar regions.\\" Denise Allen was the first woman awarded the Australian Antarctic Medal, in 1989.

This was the Virgin Islands' second time competing at a Summer Paralympic Games. They were represented by one athlete, Ivan Espinosa, who contested one event, the men's 1500 meters T37. In that event, he came in 8th place. Background The United States Virgin Islands made their second Paralympics appearance in Rio de Janeiro, with their Paralympic Games debut occurring four years prior in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. In contrast, the Virgin Islands have been competing at the Olympic Games since the 1968 Summer Olympics. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7‚Äì18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. The USVI sent one competitor to Rio, in track and field, Ivan Espinosa. He was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Disability classifications Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories: amputation, which may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, though there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; and Les autres, which is any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, like dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities. Other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. Athletics Espinosa was 34 years old at the time of the Rio Paralympics, and these Paralympics were his second significant international competition, after the 2015 Parapan American Games. He suffers from cerebral palsy and is classified as T37. The International Paralympic Committee describes T37 as athletes that \\"have moderate hypertonia, ataxia or athetosis in one half of the body. The other side of the body may be minimally affected but always demonstrates good functional ability in running. Arm action is asymmetrical. Some trunk asymmetry is usually evident.\\" On 11 September, Espinosa took part in the men's 1500 meters T37. He finished in a time of 5 minutes and 7 seconds, which put him in 8th and last place. Michael McKillop of Ireland won the gold medal in a time of 4 minutes and 12.11 seconds; the silver medal was won by Liam Stanley of Canada, and the bronze by Madjid Djemai of Algeria. {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Events !colspan=\\"2\\"Final - !Time !Rank -align=center align=leftIvan Espinosa align=leftMen's 1500 m T37 5:07.00 8 }  See also  *Virgin Islands at the 2016 Summer Olympics  References  Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 2016 in United States Virgin Islands sports ","title":"Virgin Islands at the 2016 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"51410534","text":"Panama sent a delegation to compete at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7‚Äì18 September 2016.

He earned qualification to the Games because his throw of 9.44 metres in the men's shot put F54‚Äì55 at the 2015 Parapan American Games was 0.44 metres better than the \\"B\\" qualifying standard for that discipline. Before the Paralympics, Almengor said to La Prensa that he did not wish to predict the result of his event but promised to perform to the best of his ability. On 16 September, he took part in the men's shot put F54‚Äì55 competition, finishing eleventh out of twelve athletes who started the event, with a throw of 9.16 metres. Iveth Valdes Romero was 39 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympics and was also debuting in the Paralympic Games. She was left paralyzed from the waist down after an automobile driven by an allegedly intoxicated driver collided with her vehicle and sent it down a ravine in Campana on 19 July 2009. Romero is classified as F56 by the IPC and competes in a sitting position. She qualified for the Games by receiving a wild card invitation because her throw of 11 metres in the women's javelin F55‚ÄìF56 was a metre off the \\"B\\" qualifying standard for her event. Romero stated before the Paralympics that while she was nervous about competing, she promised to perform to the best of her ability, and vowed to improve her personal best mark. On 10 September, she competed in the women's javelin F55‚ÄìF56 event. Romero was given three attempts to set a mark and her best throw was set during her first try at 13.57 metres.

It is located in the Vargem Grande neighborhood, in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The construction on the complex began in 2011 and the club began use of the facilities in mid 2012. Between 2015 and 2016, major additions were implemented at the complex including more football pitches, a medical center, and Center of Excellence in Performance (CEP). The total construction cost of the campus is approximately R$30 million. Construction of the entire complex was completed in 2016. On the morning of February 8, 2019 a fire broke out in the living quarters of several youth academy players while they were sleeping. Ten players between the ages of 14 and 17 were killed, and three others were hospitalized with burn injuries.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47170055 History The property where the complex is located was acquired on August 30, 1984 by president George Helal, but the start of construction was delayed for many years. At the time, the land was purchased for Cr$300 million (Brazilian cruzeiro). The real estate was later valued at R$350 million, an increase of 6,900 %.

The fire resulted in the deaths of ten academy players between the ages of 14 and 17 training with the club. Three others were injured. The cause of the fire was a malfunctioning air-conditioning unit that caught fire in the room of one of the victims close to 5:00. The location of the fire was the temporary living quarters in a newly expanded section of the campus. The state Labor Ministry launched a task force to determine if any preventative actions could have been taken, and to ensure that the families of the victims would be accommodated.

This was the nation's fifth time taking part in a Summer Paralympic Games. The Afghan delegation consisted of a single athlete, Mohammad Durani, who competed in the javelin throw. Originally he finished 16th in his event, but he was retroactively disqualified for a doping violation. Background Afghanistan made its Paralympic debut at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, United States. With the exception of the 2000 Summer Paralympics, they have sent a delegation to every Summer Paralympics since, making Rio the nation's fifth time participating at the Paralympics. They have never participated in the Winter Paralympic Games, and have never won a Paralympic medal. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7‚Äì18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. Athlete Mohammad Durani was the only competitor for Afghanistan in Rio. He was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.  Disability classifications  Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories: amputation, which may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, though there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; and Les autres, which is any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, like dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities. Other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. Athletics Mohammad Durani was 42 years old at the time of the Rio de Janeiro Paralympics. He competed in the men's javelin throw for athletes classified between F42‚ÄìF44 on 9 September. He finished with a personal best of 26.51 meters, but that put him into last place, and thus not allowed to proceed to the final three throws. However, on 19 September, it was revealed he had tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone, a substance the World Anti-Doping Agency classifies under its list of \\"Endogenous Anabolic Androgenic Steroids\\" and is banned in both in-competition and out-of-competition testing; accordingly Durani was disqualified and his result annulled.

He qualified for the Games by using a wild card because he had not competed in any internationally sanctioned qualifying tournament in the three years leading up to the Games. The Palestinian Paralympic Committee negotiated and explained to the sports' governing body, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), about Azzam's restrictions of movement due to the constant closures of the Rafah Border Crossing and the Erez Crossing by Israeli authorities, which prevented him from attending three international training camps. This restricted him to staying in the Gaza Strip preparing for the Games with corroded shot put metal balls and on a sandy playground that did not meet international standards.

The country's participation in Rio marked its ninth appearance at the quadrennial event with the exception of the years between 1988 and 2004. The delegation consisted of one short distance swimmer, Vladyslava Kravchenko, who was announced as the country's representative in April 2016. She was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Kravchenko competed in three swimming events but failed to advance into the final of each event as her times in her respective competitions were not fast enough to qualify for the later stages of each contest. Background Malta participated in nine Summer Paralympic Games between its d√©but at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome and the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro with the exceptions of 1976 and 1988 through to 2004. Entering the 2016 competition, eight athletes representing Malta had won a total of seven medals in athletics, lawn bowls, snooker and table tennis. Malta competed at the 2016 Rio Summer Paralympic Games from 7 to 18 September. The Malta Federation of Sports Associations for Disabled Persons (MFSADP) had financial difficulties heading into the Rio Paralympics but these were resolved when a company lent financial aid for defraying travel costs and enabled payment to the International Paralympic Committee. The MFSADP sent a single short-distance swimmer to the Games, Vladyslava Kravchenko, who was confirmed as part of the team in April 2016. Kravchenko travelled with her coach Isabelle Zarb. 2008 Maltese representative Antonio Flores (athletics) severely injured his right foot during training and withdrew from the quadrennial event. Another unknown athlete failed to qualify for not meeting the necessary qualification times. Kravchenko was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Disability classifications Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis.

Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. Swimming Ukrainian-born Vladyslava Kravchenko, paralysed due to a spinal cord injury she sustained from a lighting structure falling on her at a September 2008 party in Qawra, was the sole para-athlete to represent Malta at the Rio Paralympic Games and was the first woman to represent the country in the quadrennial event since the 1980 Arnhem Paralympics. She was 25 years old at the time of the Games. She joined the Maltese Paralympic team in January 2013, and made an arrangement that enabled her to train for the Games while continuing to work as a chartered accountant for PricewaterhouseCoopers Malta. Kravchenko was drawn in the second heat of the women's 50 metre butterfly S5 on 10 September, failing to progress into the final as her time of one minutes and 18.68 seconds placed her seventh in her heat and last overall. She was 27.12 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who reached the final. She similarly did not advance into the final of the women's 100 metre breaststroke SB4 held the following day because her time of three minutes and 21.16 seconds placed her thirteenth (and last) overall. The final swimming competition Kravchenko took part in was the women's 50 metre backstroke S5 on 16 September. She again failed to advance into the final after her time of one minute and 3.12 seconds, placed her sixth (and last overall) in the second heat and was 12.19 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who progressed to the later stages. ;Women {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=2Athlete !rowspan=2Events !colspan=\\"2\\"Heats !colspan=\\"2\\"Final - ! scope=\\"col\\" Time ! scope=\\"col\\" Rank ! scope=\\"col\\" Time ! scope=\\"col\\" Rank -align=center align=left rowspan=3Vladyslava Kravchenko align=left50 m backstroke S5 1:03.12 11 colspan=2Did not advance -align=center align=left100 m breaststroke SB4  3:21.16  13 colspan=2Did not advance - align=center align=left50 m butterfly S5 1:18.68 13 colspan=2Did not advance } See also * Malta at the 2016 Summer Olympics References Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 2016 in Maltese sport ","title":"Malta at the 2016 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"51410751","text":"This article contains a list of notable Malay Singaporeans, people with Malay ancestry born or naturalised in Singapore.

She qualified for the Rio Games by meeting the \\"A\\" qualifying standards for the women's shot put and discus throw events at a meeting in the Montenegrin town of Bar in April 2016. This was officially confirmed by the International Paralympic Committee on 30 June. Before the Paralympics, Goranoviƒá said, \\"I had enough time to recover after throwing the ball, I felt the terrain and the atmosphere at the Olympic Stadium, I have done two training sessions, and I've thrown over 20 meters, and I hope to repeat it when it's needed the most.\\" On 9 September, she competed in the women's shout put F41, finishing eighth out of nine athletes, with a mark of 6.57 metres.

Background The name of the network, Rabea, means the fourth, which is why its logo features a hand holding up four fingers. The name derives from a mosque and square in Cairo, where some of the largest groups of Muslim Brotherhood supporters would meet and protest. At one point there was a sit in there that lasted forty days before being dispersed. This sign symbolizes solidarity for those protestors during the anti-coup movement for the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi. Many today see this as a terrorist sign, especially considering the fact that the Egyptian government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization in 2013. Allegedly, the first person to physically display this slogan was Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.http://www.alarabiya.net/ar/arab-and- world/egypt/2013/12/05/-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%82-%D8%A8%D8%AB%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84.html The network, established by the Muslim Brotherhood, launched in 2013 in Turkey. Rabea TV announced in 2013 that it would begin broadcasting with the support of the Turkish State. According to local Egyptian media, Turkey\\"s National Security Service (MIT) founded the network under the leadership of Hakan Fidan, MIT's undersecretary of the intelligence service. In early talks about Rabea TV, a spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood during Morsi's presidency indicated his fears that this channel's establishment could lead to a new crisis in Egyptian-Turkish relations. Turkish politician Faruk Logoglu expressed similar sentiments when he stated that Turkey's hosting of networks that terrorize the Egyptian people and threaten foreigners has placed Turkey in a questionable position in international platforms. Al Rabea TV broadcasts from Istanbul, and its content is known to have an Islamist slant and pushes Muslim Brotherhood propaganda. It uses the slogan, \\"The Pulse of Freedom\\" as self-promotion. Despite Rabea TV being aired from Turkey, Turkish government has denied that any Muslim Brotherhood affiliate TV stations are being broadcast from Turkey. Controversial content The network has aired its fair share of aggressive and violent content, and is known to incite public opinion on violence towards state, military, and civil institutions. On air, a cleric named Salama Abd al-Qawi issued a statement of encouragement for anyone who would assassinate Egyptian President Abdel Fatteh al-Sisi stating that whoever got the job done would be doing a good deed. Also, on one of Rabea TV's programs, a threatening warning statement was broadcast from a group called the Revolutionary Group Leadership, telling Westerners and Western investments in Egypt to leave the country or they would be targeted soon. The station also aired content that police and soldiers in attendance of a western economic conference that was to take place in Cairo would be killed. Followers The network has YouTube and Facebook pages. Its YouTube page, founded in 2015 and featuring both a live stream and past videos, is subscribed to by over 1,100 users and has had a total of 160,112 views. Its Facebook page has been active since 2013, where Rabea TV is listed as an alternative global media network. Rabea TV describes itself as an outlet to provide contemporary political issues through the Islamic perspective, highlighting issues of the Islamic world. Additionally, it says that it seeks to achieve the demands of the Arab revolutions by building a relationship between the viewer and symbols of the Islamic intellectual. The page's background photo is a picture of former Muslim Brotherhood President, Mohammed Morsi, with the channel's logo as the profile picture. It frequently posts graphic photos and controversial Islamist statements, including numerous statements against Egypt's current president al-Sisi and praises of the demoted former president, Mohammed Morsi and of terrorist linked Muslim Brotherhood founder, Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Ownership Rabea TV is owned by Qatari businessman Hashim bin Mohammed al-Awadhi. Al-Awadhi is the head of the media department for the controversial Qatari charity, Eid charity, also called the Sheikh Eid bin Mohammad al Thani Charitable Association. This charity has a reputation for backing the Muslim Brotherhood, globally designated terrorists and terrorist financiers, and al-Qaeda members. Al- Awadhi's son was killed as part of ISIS's convoy of martyrs in 2015 near Kobani, Syria. Furthermore, al-Awadhi's Twitter account is known to display graphic violent content that is in support of the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorist advances. Current standing Rabea TV has weakened significantly in its standing, and has been on the verge of bankruptcy. This is due in part to the recent decline in Turkey's popularity in the Middle East based on polls conducted of 16 regional states as well as negative attention from foreign entities. Sources have reported that the Rabea TV's controversial standing has left it vulnerable to threats legal prosecution to stop broadcasting. A French satellite company has indicated its plans to discontinue the channel after it received notice of the network's association as a terrorist channel.

It is the first satellite of the EpicNG service, and covers North America and Latin America from the 50¬∞ West longitude, where it replaced Intelsat 1R. It also replaced Intelsat 805 which was moved from 56.5¬∞ West to 169¬∞ East. It has a mixed C band, Ku band and Ka band payload with all bands featuring wide and the Ku also featuring spot beams. Satellite description The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Boeing on the Boeing 702MP satellite bus. It has a launch mass of and a design life of more than 15 years. When stowed for launch, the satellite measures . It is powered by two wings, with four panels each, of triple-junction GaAs solar cells, that span when deployed. Intelsat 29e can generate 15.8 kW at the end of its expected life and has four Li-ion batteries. This three axis stabilized platform has a bi-propellant propulsion system using NTO/N2O4. It has a Liquid Apogee Engine for orbit raising and and thrusters for station keeping. The propellant tanks hold approximately of N2O4 and of NTO. This new series of geosynchronous satellites lack an Earth Sensor, and thus enter Earth pointing attitude based on the orbital position as determined by the star tracker. Its payload is the first high throughput EpicNG deployment, of the six planned as of January 2016. The EpicNG is characterized by the implementation of frequency reuse due to a mix of frequency and polarization in small spot beams. Not only applied to the classical HTS Ka band, but also applying the same technique in Ku band and C band. The EpicNG series also keep the use of wide beams to offer high throughput and broadcast capabilities in the same satellite. The payload is designed and manufactured by Boeing based on the work of the WGS constellation. It most innovative feature of this fully digital payload, is that it enables to dynamically link two sites through a single satellite without needing to go through a ground station. In the case of Intelsat 29e, the C band side has 14 physical transponders with a bandwidth 864 MHz Ku or 24 transponder equivalent. It covers South America in a wide beam. The Ku band has physical 56 transponders (249 transponder equivalent) for a total bandwidth of 9,395 MHz. The Ku spot beams cover the Americas and the North Atlantic route, while a wide beam can broadcast to North America and North Atlantic. The Ka band payload has 450 MHz of bandwidth on a global beam centered at its position. History In July 2009, Intelsat became the first customer of the Boeing 702MP platform, when it placed an order for four spacecraft, Intelsat 21, Intelsat 22, Intelsat 27 and what would become Intelsat 29e. On June 7, 2012, Intelsat announced the EpicNG platform. It would improve available bandwidth due to the use of frequency reuse and polarization and feature spot and wide beams, enabling high bandwidth and broadcast applications on a backward compatible way. The first two satellites would be Intelsat 29e and Intelsat 33e. On September 4, 2012, Intelsat and Boeing announced that Intelsat 29e, the first EpicNG satellite, would be made by Boeing on the 702MP platform, completing the 2009 order of four such satellites. In May 2013 Intelsat ordered a further four 702MP-based EpicNG satellites, Intelsat 32e, Intelsat 33e and two as of August 2016 unnamed spacecraft. And in July 2014 a sixth Epic was ordered, Intelsat 35e. During 2013, Intelsat signed a contract to launch Intelsat 29e aboard an Ariane 5. Brian Sing, was assigned as Senior Program Manager for the launch aboard the rocket. During June 2015, the payload was integrated and went through testing. First it was deployed and stowed back, then it went through sound environment and vibration testing, and finally deployment was tested again. On July 14, 2015, the payload integration to the satellite bus and its non-environmental testing was completed. It would then go through the environmental testing campaign which would start with thermal vacuum chamber tests. It is a Boeing design based on the work of the WGS constellation. On December 10, 2015, Intelsat announced that the launch date for Intelsat 29e had been set for January 27, 2016. After four years of project development, Intelsat 29e arrived to the launch site aboard an Antonov 124 on December 11, 2015. At the site's Payload Processing Facility, Boeing technicians unpackaged the spacecraft and associated equipment and performed a quick fit check. On the second weeks of January, 2016, the satellite was fueled and installed in the rocket payload adapter. By January 21, the spacecraft had been moved to the Final Assembly Building where it was mated to the launcher rocket. On January 26, 2016 all checks were completed and the launch review for the next day was completed. On January 27, 2016, at 23:20 UTC, an Ariane 5 ECA launched from the ELA-3 launch pad at the Guiana Space Center. Intelsat 29e, its only passenger, separated 30 minutes later, and the satellite first signals were received shortly afterwards by the Kumsan, South Korea, Ground Station. The next two days were spent evaluating the health of the satellite and determining the exact orbit, then a series of nine orbital maneuvers to raise the perigee to were started. This orbit circularization would consume approximately of propellant. When it reached its test position at 49.7¬∞ West, it deployed its antennas and solar panels. In a March 28, 2016 blog by Duy Nguyen, Senior Program Manager, it was announced that Intelsat 29e had successfully passed the 30-day payload in-orbit testing (PIOT) and was undergoing the first performance testing with an anchor customer. It had been particularly challenging because it was the first digital configurable payload for Intelsat, and they had to also test the ground segment for the first time. On April 7, 2019, the propulsion system of Intelsat 29e developed a fuel leak. Service to customers was interrupted, and communication with the satellite intermittent. On April 8, 2019, the ground telescopes of ExoAnalytic Solutions spotted debris around Intelsat 29e. IS-29e is currently tumbling and drifting to the east. Intelsat issued a statement declaring the satellite a total loss on April 18, 2019.

Family and education Louis Clemens Spiering was born in St. Louis in 1874, the middle of three children of Theresa (Bernays) Spiering and Ernst Spiering, a violinist and orchestra conductor. His elder brother Theodore became a violinist, and his maternal grandfather was Karl Ludwig Bernays, a German-born Marxist journalist who changed his name to Charles Louis Bernays when he emigrated to St. Louis. Spiering attended Webster Public School and then was sent to Berlin, Germany, for schooling at the Realgymnasium, from which he graduated in 1891. After two semesters studying architecture at the Berlin Royal School of Technology, he returned stateside to take up a position with Chicago architect William A. Otis. In 1895, Spiering returned to Europe to enter the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, from which he graduated in 1902. Along the way, he won a prize in sculpture at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs, and he studied in the atelier of Noel-Marcel Lambert, the architect in charge of restoration at Versailles. Although the Beaux-Arts style came to signify a type of neoclassicalism in architecture, a critic was later to observe of Spiering that what he gained from his Paris training was actually a \\"freedom to design in whatever format he thought appropriate to the circumstances.\\" Architectural career In 1902, Spiering returned to St. Louis and took up a position as assistant to E. L. Masqueray, the chief of design for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, better known as the St. Louis World's Fair. For the succeeding eighteen months, Spiering worked on a wide range of elements for the fair, including the general layout of the grounds and specific buildings such as the Palais du Costume, the wireless telegraph tower, the express office, the horticulture building, and the restaurant pavilions and colonnades on Art Hill. He was also Superintending Architect for the French and Austrian governments' buildings. Spiering opened his own practice in 1903. Among his local commissions were a new building for the Artists Guild (commissioned in 1907), the Soulard Branch Library (commission won in a design competition in partnership with George Hellmuth), and the Sheldon Memorial Building for the St. Louis Ethical Society, now a concert hall. He also set up a design studio in the then-new architecture program at Washington University and ran evening classes for working draftspeople. He was a member of the American Institute of Architects. Spiering fell ill in 1910 (possibly of appendicitis) and never completely recovered, dying two years later.

Earlier Life  Smith served as Executive Director of Open Meadows School in Portland, Oregon from 1982 to 2005.  Time as Superintendent  Smith was hired as Superintendent of Portland Public Schools in 2007, to replace Vicki Phillips. For the first three years of her time as Superintendent, Smith and the School Board had set forth three Student Achievement targets; which were to increase the number of third graders exceeding State reading standards, the number of seventh graders passing the state writing test, and the number of Freshmen passing the expected number of classes, all by at least five percent. While third graders' and freshmen's scores improved in these respective areas, none of the three goals were met. Despite that, in October 2010, Smith received a highly positive report on her first three years, allowing her to continue her career as Superintendent. In 2015, Smith shifted the start of the school year from the day after Labor Day to the week before, citing concerns that Portland Public Schools has one of the shortest school years in the United States. Soon after her announcement, the nearby school districts in Lake Oswego, West Linn School District, and Forest Grove changed their schedules similarly. In March 2016, Smith announced a number of changes to school boundaries, due to concerns of overcrowding. In the same month, she donated an empty school building to the City for use as a homeless shelter, in return for free TriMet bus passes for high school students.  Retirement  In June 2016, Smith announced that she would be stepping down from the role of Superintendent after just one more year. However, on July 18, 2016, she announced that she would be stepping down immediately. Her announcement came shortly after a report had been released on Portland Public Schools' lead testing after the school board released a damning report showing how Portland Public Schools dropped the ball on testing water for lead, fixing problems that were found and notifying the public of test results. She was required to give the district 90 days notice before stepping down, although she had at least 90 days of unused vacation days, and in effect retired immediately. Smith denied having known about elevated lead levels until testing began in late May 2016.

When Warshafsky turned 18, he joined the Marines and later attended the University of Wisconsin Law School on the GI Bill. Warshafsky later lived on the upper east side of Milwaukee in the Murray Hill neighborhood after graduating from college. He went on to build a reputation for winning multi-million dollar lawsuits, mostly against big name drug companies. During his professional career, he spent his time in both local and national politics.

In 1873 the present Sac County Courthouse was completed a half block north of the former courthouse to eliminate the turns around the city square. The local GAR acquired the half-block property that remained as Monument Square for a soldier's monument and a hall to honor General Sherman.

The Duchy of Merania was a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire from 1152 until 1248. The dukes of Merania were recognised as princes of the Empire enjoying imperial immediacy at a time when these concepts were just coming into use to distinguish the highest ranks of imperial nobility. The name \\"Merania\\" (\\"sea-land\\") comes from either the High German word for sea, meer or the Slavic word for the same, morje (both cognate with Latin mare). The name literally means \\"land by the sea\\" (am Meer), referring to its location on the Adriatic. Territory The exact territorial extent of Merania is unknown. It probably included the town of Fiume (Rijeka) and the coast of the Kvarner Gulf, either on the Istrian peninsula or across from it. The author of the Historia de expeditione Friderici imperatoris, an account of Barbarossa's crusade of 1190, writing around 1200, refers to \\"the Duke of Dalmatia, also called Croatia or Merania\\", specifying (imprecisely) that the duchy neighboured Zahumlje and Ra≈°ka. The actual duchy contained at most only a small part of the region of Dalmatia, which had historically belonged to Croatia. By the twelfth century, Croatia was in a personal union with Hungary. This territory came under imperial control during the reign of Henry IV. According to the fourteenth-century Chronicon pictum Vindobonense (Viennese Illustrated Chronicle), the \\"march of Dalmatia\\" (marchia Dalmacie) was occupied by the Carinthians between 1064 and 1068 during the reign of Dmitar Zvonimir, who in fact was not king of Croatia until 1075. Despite this inconsistency in the chronicle, several modern historians, led by Ljudmil Hauptmann, have connected this Dalmatian borderland with the later duchy of Merania. According to the historians Miho Barada and Lujo Margetiƒá, it was the accession of the young King Stephen II of Hungary in 1116 that provided an opportunity for the Emperor Henry V to annex the entire eastern coast of Istria and the coast opposite as far as the river Rjeƒçina, including the city of Fiume. This territory, conquered for the emperor by the lords of Duino (Devin), became known as Merania. It is not clear to what extent the Meranian dukes of the Dachau or Andechs lines ever managed to exert their control over the region. There are other theories proposing a different etymology of \\"Merania\\". Erwin Herrmann argues that the name cannot have actually been in use as the name of a region, since it is unknown save as the name of the duchy that existed between 1152 and 1248. He argues that it is probably formed from the name of the seat of the lordship, which he identifies with the town of Marano Lagunare. The region he identifies as that between the rivers Tagliamento and Corno. In older literature, Merania is sometimes mistakenly identified with Meran, a town in the Tyrol, because the Andechser dukes held land in the Tyrol. August Dimitz, while correcting the Tyrolean error, equates Merania with the march of Istria. House of Dachau (1152‚Äì1180) The duchy of Merania was created for the Wittelsbach Count Conrad II of Dachau by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa during an Imperial Diet at Regensburg in June 1152 by separating some lordships from the marches of Carniola and Istria, which were under the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Bavaria. Merania thus bordered the Kingdom of Croatia, which belonged to Hungary. This was done despite the fact that the Diet had refused to approve Frederick's proposed invasion of Hungary. Rather than an attempt to circumvent the diet in his designs on Hungary, it can be seen as part of a more general policy, pre-dating Frederick's reign, of elevating noblemen of the rank of count to that of duke as a counterweight to the powerful hereditary dukes of the so-called stem duchies (like Bavaria). It was also part of a reorganisation of the southeastern frontier that included the creation of the Duchy of Austria in 1156. The historian Wilhelm Wegener has proposed that Merania was created out of lands claimed by Conrad through his mother, Willibirg, daughter of Udalschalk, count of Lurngau, and Adelaide, daughter of Margrave Ulrich I of Carniola. He proposed that Willibirg was heir to Adelaide, who was heir to her brother Ulrich II (died 1112). Thus, the creation of Conrad's duchies was a partial vindication of his claims on Carniola and had a hereditary basis. This theory had not found wide acceptance, since several duchies were created in Germany in the twelfth century with no cleary hereditary basis. These new ducal titles created in the twelfth century were often based on insignificant or diminished territories. Merania was small, with little in the way of rights or income for its holder. The ducal title that technically pertained only to the newly acquired territory was thus also often used in conjunction with the dynastic seat, and Conrad was thus sometimes known as the Duke of Dachau. Bishop Otto I of Freising, in his history of Barbarossa's reign, calls Conrad the Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia, an impressive if imprecise title that alluded to the origin of the lands in question as part of Croatia. It has been argued that since neither Duke Conrad I nor his son, Conrad II, is ever recorded as having visited the region around the Istrian peninsula or the Kvarner Gulf, it is more likely that their title referred to unspecified lands around the southeastern frontier but not actually under imperial control. On this theory, Merania was at first a purely titular dignity for the Dachauers that only became a territorial reality under the Andechsers, who created it out of lands they held in the far southeast. House of Andechs (1180‚Äì1248) In 1180, Frederick Barbarossa transferred Merania to Berthold, the son of the count of Andechs. This was probably done in order to maintain a balance of power and rank between the House of Andechs and the House of Wittelsbach, which had received the Duchy of Bavaria earlier that year. Although some sources ascribe the transfer of Merania to Conrad's death and propose that Berthold was his heir through his mother, in fact Conrad II did not die until 1182. The transfer of 1180 was part of a reorganization of the southeastern frontier by the emperor. Berthold inherited the marches of Istria and Carniola from his father in 1188. Although the Andechsers' primary lands lay elsewhere in the Empire, their southeastern connection involved them in its foreign affairs. When Barbarossa passed through the Balkans on his crusade in 1189, he negotiated the marriage of one of Berthold's daughters to Toljen, the eldest son of Prince Miroslav of Zahumlje, a younger brother of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja of Serbia. Although Berthold consented, the marriage probably never took place. In any case, the Duke of Merania was considered a near neighbour of the Serb princes. The Andechsers pushed the empire's southeastern frontier further south, acquiring Gottschee, ƒårnomelj and Metlika for Merania‚ÄìCarniola at the expense of Croatia. On Berthold's death in 1204 Merania went to his eldest son, Otto I, and Istria to a younger son, Henry.

She is most widely known for her work on early-type stars and was considered one of the world's leading experts in the field. During her lifetime she received many awards or her contributions to astronomy and astrophysics.  Early life  Underhill grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was the only girl of five children born to European immigrants Irene Anna (n√©e Creery) and Frederic Clare Underhill. She was awarded the Lieutenant Governor's medal in high school for her outstanding school performance. She was close with her twin brother and three younger brothers, and helped to raise them following the death of her mother when she was 18. In 1944 her twin brother was killed in World War II.  Education  Underhill graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1942 with a BA Hons in chemistry. She continued her education at the University and received a master's degree in physics and mathematics in 1944. After graduating with her MA she received a substantial scholarship from the Canadian Federation of University Women which enabled her to enroll at the University of Toronto, however she left after a year because the University's astrophysics program was considered weak at that time. She went on to receive her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1948 under the supervision of famous astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Her thesis topic was multi-layered stellar atmospheres and contained the first model for this phenomenon. Work From 1948 to 1949 she held an NRC Postdoctoral Fellowship at Copenhagen Observatory. In 1949, Underhill accepted a position as a research scientist at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO), in Victoria, where she worked until 1962. During this time she was a visiting professor at both Harvard and Princeton universities. While at Princeton she used their computing facilities to write software to model stellar atmospheres. At the DOA she encountered sexism from her male PhD colleagues who limited her responsibilities while giving more to less qualified male coworkers. In 1962 she unexpectedly received a letter of offer from the Utrecht University in the Netherlands for the position of full professor in astrophysics. She was reluctant to leave Canada so the decision to take the job was not an easy one despite the mistreatment she had experienced by her colleagues. At the Utrecht University she lectured at the graduate level and published The Early Type Stars. In 1970, she received a job offer arrived from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center where she worked until her retirement 15 years later.

His songs have been recorded by many other artists, including George Strait, Tim McGraw, The Derailers, LeAnn Rimes, Doug Sahm, Johnny Mathis and Barbra Streisand. Blaker has also been a popular regional entertainer and has released several albums of his own material with his band, the Texas Honky- Tonk Band. Biography After growing up in Texas, Blaker spent time in Hawaii and California before returning to Texas in the 1970s. In San Marcos, Texas he got to know the members of the Ace in the Hole Band, including their front-man George Strait. Blaker's Texas Honky Tonk Band played with the Ace in the Hole Band at a number of venues in Houston and Central Texas. In 1982, Strait included Blaker's song \\"The Only Thing I Have Left\\" on his second album, Strait from the Heart. Tim McGraw later covered the song. Strait has since recorded six more songs by Blaker, including \\"She Lays It All on the Line\\" for the soundtrack to Strait's 1992 film Pure Country. In 1999, Barbra Streisand recorded his song \\"We Must Be Loving Right\\", co-written with Roger Brown, after hearing Strait's version of it. According to Blaker, Streisand's husband James Brolin had been playing Strait's album, and Streisand \\"heard the song and liked it enough to put it on her next album. That album was all love songs, so it fit right in.\\" Blaker has also written songs with Jim Lauderdale and others. Blaker has produced records, mostly for himself and other regional Texas artists, including the Ed Burleson song \\"My Perfect World.\\" In 2002, Blaker announced that he was retiring and moving to an island off the coast of Panama. Although retired from touring, Blaker is still writing songs and in 2015 released a trilogy of EP's of all new music called \\"Still Swingin'\\", \\"Still Rockin'\\", and \\"Still Country\\".

It is based on Eleanor Catton's novel of the same name. It was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot The instructors for the New Zealand drama school are selecting the first year students. Stanley is admitted. The teacher Hanna is hard on him when he fails to add any emotion to his lines with Frankie. Shy and reserved Stanley meets his two roommates, William and Theo. Teacher Livia wants him to use life experiences to act authentically. Add a \\"Fuck you\\" and get physical. This is an acting school. A sex scandal breaks exposing married tennis pro George Saladin and his star student Victoria. Stanley meets Isolde and they exchange phone numbers. Stanley is assigned to a five-member group acting project. He meets with Hanna and does not connect with this teacher. She wants him to try harder and dig deeper. After lunch with his psychologist father, he does a role playing his father who likes to tell bad jokes. Dad does not want his son to be an actor. Hanna really liked his performance and gave him a book from her own library to read. She tells him acting is hard and he must go all the way. Keep going. Finally he has started acting. Victoria and Isolde are sisters and they talk a little about the scandal. Isolde tells her sister that she likes Stanley. Later Isolde tells Stanley she had seen Saladin with her sister. There was no forced sex and it looked consensual to her. Stanley's group has decided to use the sex scandal as their acting project. Stanley has not told Isolde and William reminds him she should know. The next in class assignment is to act an intimate scene. William tells of an Easter dinner event where his father humiliates his mother. Hanna did not like it. He only told a story. Intimacy requires the actor to bear his soul. There must be trust. William says this class was the last place he would share intimacy. Frankie talks to coach Saladin at the coffee shop trying to get background for their project. Isolde invites Stanley and William over for a barbeque. William plays with the family dog. Victoria secretly borrows Stanley's phone to call her coach. William wants Stanley to tell Isolde about their project and once again he fails to come clean. Later the coach calls Stanley to tell Victoria that he has changed his mind. He is staying with his wife. Hanna has heard of Stanley's girlfriend. She tells him to call off a schoolgirl crush and not embarrass the Institute. He sees Isolde and asks her to return his book, but can he just have one picture. She tells him if you will find a private place, I will show you much more. They have sex. They are in love. Nonetheless the tennis project continues mocking teacher sex with a student. During teacher Perry's class, they announce that William has died in a car crash. At William's memorial service, Stanley sees Isolde kissing a girl. She tells him that she is sorry but he walks away. Later at a rehearsal, Marnie asks Stanley did he drop Isolde because of the other girl or because of their play. He says she was just too young. There was dissent at a student assembly. Teacher Livia takes the student's side and thinks Dean Hanna Bauer cares more about her new theatre than student grief. In fact she walks out. Later in the parking lot, Hanna tells Stanley that the sex scandal is a great subject even though the coach has plead guilty. She calls it great agent bait. Isolde goes to the school looking for Stanley and finds all the set decoration for the play. She feels betrayed. Stanley finally goes to the Isolde home and tells them about the play. The father Stephen cannot believe how they can violate the family's privacy. Never contact either of his daughters and get out of their home. He explains the performance is cancelled. Stanley tells Isolde he loves her. The night of the performance the curtain parts a small opening, the music starts and the house lights come on. The audience waits. Frankie walks down the isle and walks through the curtain. Minutes later another woman walks down the aisle and through the curtain.

Kenny finds the film worth the wait with this coming of age tale following the students at a prestigious New Zealand drama academy. He likes watching life and art rub against one another as well as watching actors with talent gain credibility with good teaching and training. The director \\"delivers a good hour and a half of engagement and intrigue\\" only to ask \\"Really?\\" at the ending.

The Arabs then shot the 3 Jewish men; only 1 survived.'Nablus Bandits Seen as Izz ed Din's followers', Palestine Post, Friday, 17 April 1936.

A Never- ending Conflict: A Guide to Israeli Military History, Greenwood, p. 23.  19 April  On 19 April, rumors spread in the Arab community that \\"many Arabs had been killed by Jews\\", and Arabs began to attack Jews in the streets of Jaffa. An Arab mob marched on the Jewish-owned Anglo-Palestine Bank. The British Mandatory police guarding the bank defended themselves by firing into the mob, killing two of the rioters. This incited the mob to \\"fury\\" and Jews began to be killed in the streets. Manuela Williams describes this as the \\"peak\\" event in a series of violent attacks leading up to the declaration of a general strike by the Arab Higher Committee. According to Aryeh Avneri, citing the History of the Haganah, the rioting broke out first among the Haurani dockworkers in Jaffa Port. A mob of Arab men rampaged through the mixed Muslim, Christian and Jewish streets of Jaffa, killing and beating Jews and wrecking Jewish homes and businesses.Rose, Norman. \\"The Debate on Partition, 1937-38: The Anglo-Zionist Aspect: I. The Proposal\\", Middle Eastern Studies 6, no. 3 (1970): 297-318. . 11 people were reported dead in the first day's rioting. These included 2 Arabs \\"shot by British police in self-defense,\\" and 9 Jews, with dozens of others wounded, \\"most of the Jewish injured bore knife wounds.\\"9 Jews, 2 Arabs Dead, 54 Hurt In Jaffa Riots: Moslems Slain by British Police, Foes Knifed in Batlle (sic) Following Killing of a Jew by Bandits,\\" New York Herald Tribune, 20 April 1936, p. 1. The rioting went on for a total of 3 days, it was finally suppressed by the British military. Impact =Refugees= The continuing threat of violence combined with the destruction of Jewish property and arson attacks that destroyed Jewish homes forced 12,000 Jews to flee Jaffa as refugees. 9,500 were housed by the Tel Aviv municipality, imposing a heavy financial burden on the city. Seventy-five temporary shelters were created in schools, synagogues, government and industrial buildings.Marginal Populations and Urban Identity in Time of Emergency: The Case of the 1936 Refugees in Tal Aviv,\\" Arnon Golan, Journal of Modern Jewish Studies, Vol. 9 , Iss. 2, 2010. During May and June the Haganah was able to stabilize the security situation to the point where about 4,000 of the refugees were able to return to their homes. Others found housing privately, so that by July only 4,800 remained in public refugee camps; 3,200 of these were utterly destitute. By November, Jewish charities had placed even the destitute refugees in housing, and the refugee camps were closed. =Annexation of Jaffa to Tel Aviv= One impact of the riot was the start of a political demand that the Jewish neighborhoods of Jaffa be separated from Jaffa and incorporated into Tel Aviv.

These assets allow for the integrity and efficiency of the multiple conversions of individual knowledge into organizational knowledge.Cataldo, Jorge; Prochno, Paulo (2003) Cognitive assets: a model to understand the organizational appropriation of collective tacit knowledge. In Management of Technology Key Success Factors for Innovation and Sustainable Development. Editors: Morel-Guimaraes L Khalil T Hosni Y, 2005 pp: 123-133. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265406151 The idea of the cognitive assets was the first attempt to address the most relevant organizational assets to be exploited by cognition-driven businesses. The concept of cognitive assets is a reflection on the belief that it is sufficient the acquisition of software, such as for business intelligence or competitive intelligence to ensure that organizations make good decisions. Organizational cognitive assets comprise four main dimensions: 1) the environmental mechanisms that foster the creation and sharing of explicit knowledge; 2) organizational members‚Äô cognitive capacities; 3) organizational members¬¥ transactional potential (defined as their ability to interact and share knowledge with co-workers); and 4) Analytics and computational methods used by the organization to support decision-making processes. History The term was first used in a paper presented in 2002 at the Twelfth International Conference on Management of Technology organized by the International Association for Management of Technology (IAMOT) and published in a collection of the best papers of the conference. The paper refers to the ideas of a master's thesis presented in 2001 at Ibmec Business School, which was first used in this sense.Cataldo, Jorge (2001) Papel do Suporte Anal√≠tico √† Tomada de Decis√£o na Gest√£o do Conhecimento Organizacional. Advised by Gomes, L. F. A. Ibmec Business School library. Fundamentals of cognitive assets Although most works assume that organizational knowledge exists and that it is more than simply the sum of individual knowledge, the important question of how it becomes ‚Äúorganizational‚Äù has not been addressed in much depth. Most authors refer to the work of Nonaka and his co-authors, which remains the sole comprehensive view on organizational knowledge formation.Nonaka, I. and Takeuchi, H. (1995) The Knowledge Creating Company, Oxford University Press, New York. Although the idea of ‚Äúcollective cognition‚Äù has been contested by researchers on the grounds that ‚Äúcognition belongs to individuals, not organizations‚Äù,Eden, C. and Spender, J. C. (1998) Managerial and organizational cognition, Sage, London. there is a growing number of studies in management that address this phenomenon at a group or organizational level. These studies concentrate on cognitive phenomena in and by organizations that impact the organization as a whole. Some conceptualizations stress that the field must embrace the complexities of the two levels (individual and group), which co-exist though interactive processes.Fiol, C. M. (2002). Intraorganizational Cognition. In: Companion to Organizations (Ed, Baum, J. A.) Blackwell, Oxford. Cognition research in organizations has taken two main approaches: one computational and one interpretive. The computational stream examines the process by which managers and organizations process information and make decisions; the interpretive approach investigates how meaning is created around information in a social context. The concept of cognitive assets takes both perspectives into account; individuals¬¥ cognitive capacities and organizational decision-making systems are linked to the computational view, whereas the environment and transactional elements are linked to interpretive efforts. As defended by Lant, putting together these two perspectives will deepen our understanding of organizational cognition. Definition Analogous to the process of individual knowledge creation, cognitive assets represent to organizations what cognition potential is to individuals. The process of new knowledge generation at the individual level can be seen as the systematic and efficient combination of the information available to the individual with her cognitive potential. Similarly, we can model organizational knowledge creation as the systematic and efficient combination of information-based assets with cognitive assets. Organizational cognitive assets comprise four main dimensions: 1) the environmental mechanisms that foster the creation and sharing of explicit knowledge; 2) organizational members‚Äô cognitive capacities; 3) organizational members¬¥ transactional potential (defined as their ability to interact and share knowledge with co-workers); and 4) Analytics and computational methods used by the organization to support decision-making processes. Environment The most basic dimension of cognitive assets is the environment where cognition takes place. Differently from cognitive studies done in psychology, where laboratory experiments are used to address issues of individual cognition, researchers of cognition in management have stressed the role of the environment where decisions and actions are being taken and the interactions of people within this environment. Knowledge is seen as a function of the social and physical system in which it exists.Birkinshaw, J., Nobel, R. and Ridderstrale, J. (2002). Knowledge as a contingency variable: Do the characteristics of knowledge predict organization structure? Organization Science, 13, 274-289. The environment provides regulative (rules) and normative (values and norms) dimensions that govern organizational life. It sets the pre-conditions that allow for the transformation of individual knowledge into collective knowledge put into action. Following Orlikowski,Orlikowski, W. (2002). Knowing in Practice: Enacting a Collective Capability in Distributed Organizing. Organization Science, 13, 249-273. five sets of activities are important in the organizational environment: (1) sharing identity; (2) interacting face to face; (3) aligning effort; (4) learning by doing; and (5) supporting participation. Managers can increase the effectiveness of knowledge conversions by stimulating these five sets of activities in the areas under their control. Individual cognitive capacity The individual cognitive capacity of organizational members corresponds to their ability to process information efficiently and effectively to attain goals. That ability contributes to more and better conversions of information into collective knowledge. Humans have a knowledge structure (or schema), which ‚Äúrepresents organized knowledge about a given concept or type of stimulus‚Äù.Fiske, S. T. and Taylor, S. E. (1991) Social Cognition, McGraw Hill, New York. This knowledge structure is a mental template that individuals impose on an information environment to give it form and meaning and to enable subsequent action. That way, it has strong influence on the process of transforming information into action. The two most commonly studied attributes of knowledge structures are differentiation (the number of dimensions within a knowledge structure) and integration (the degree of interconnectedness among the knowledge structure dimensions).Walsh, J. P. (1995). Managerial and organizational cognition: Notes from a trip down memory lane. Organization Science, 6, 280-321. The higher the differentiation and integration, the more effective the knowledge structure is. Little differentiation leads to a narrow vision, which results in ineffective managerial behavior.Bartunek, J., Gordon, R. and Weathersby, R. (1983). Developing 'complicated' understanding in administrators. Academy of Management Review, 8, 273-284. Differentiation and integration are influenced by personality variables (level of aspiration, job involvement, cognitive complexity) and organizational experience (position in hierarchy, work experience). Transactional capacity Transactional capacity is ability individuals have to absorb, codify and share information and explicit knowledge in order to meet organizational objectives. Transactional capacity will be a function of personal and structural dimensions. For personal characteristics, Eric Berne‚Äôs transactional analysisBerne, E. (1973) Analisis transaccional en psicoterapia, Psique, Buenos Aires. in psychology studies three important dimensions: (1) learning; (2) rationality; and (3) emotions. The structural dimension of transactional capacity is linked to the various networks within the organization. Social networks and the role of social capital have received an increasing attention in sociology studies over the past few years. There are two main approaches: one that follows the work of Coleman,Coleman, J. S. (1988). Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital. American Journal of Sociology, 94, S95 - S120. which defends that social capital occurs in networks with closure, where the value of social capital resource is communication among members; another approach, deriving from Granovetter and Burt,Burt, R. S. (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, Harvard University Press, Boston.Granovetter, M. (1973). The Strength of Weak Ties. American Journal of Sociology, 78, 1360-1380. defends that social capital occurs in networks without closure where the value of social capital resource is derived from brokering information and exercising control. The seemingly conflicting predictions of these two approaches may be due to the fact that each one has analyzed different environments.Raider, H. and Krackhardt, D. (2002). Intraorganizational Networks. In: Companion to Organizations (Ed, Baum, J. A.) Blackwell, Oxford. But regardless of the closure of social networks, the existence of a network and individuals willing to share information within it (and capture from outside it) is important. Dyer and Nobeoka, for example, defend that a highly interconnected network benefits all members by facilitating knowledge sharing and learning and increasing productivity of members.Dyer, J. H. and Nobeoka, K. (2000). Creating and maintaining a high performance knowledge-sharing network: The Toyota Case. Strategic Management Journal, 21, 345-367. Decision-making support Organizations use different tools and systems to help their decision-making processes. These tools and systems are broadly defined as any activity that, based on explicit (but not necessarily formalized) models, helps decision-making agents to obtain solutions to their problems given their preferences and the uncertainty of the environment. Together with individuals‚Äô cognitive capacities, they define the organization‚Äôs capacity to process information and make decisions. Operations research, management science and decision science methods can be seen as analytical cognitive processes that help decision-making. These methods serve to increase the efficiency of the knowledge conversion and mobilization processes, increasing managers¬¥ ability to process information and make decisions. That way, they are also important constituents of cognitive assets.

He left behind his sonatas for cello and piano (1915), flute, viola and harp (1915), and violin and piano (1916‚Äì1917).  History  From 1914, the composer, encouraged by the music publisher Jacques Durand, intended to write a set of six sonatas for various instruments, in homage to the French composers of the 18th century. The First World War, along with the composers Couperin and Rameau, inspired Debussy as he was writing the sonatas. Durand, in his memoirs entitled Quelques souvenirs d'un √©diteur de musique, wrote the following about the sonatas' origin: > After his famous String Quartet, Debussy had not written any more chamber > music. Then, at the Concerts Durand, he heard again the Septet with trumpet > by Saint-Sa√´ns and his sympathy for this means of musical expression was > reawoken. He admitted the fact to me and I warmly encouraged him to follow > his inclination. And that is how the idea of the six sonatas for various > instruments came about.Roger Nichols (ed.), Debussy Remembered (Faber and > Faber, 1992), p. 242. In a letter to the conductor Bernard Molinari, Debussy explained that the set should include \\"different combinations, with the last sonata combining the previously used instruments\\". His death on 25 March 1918 prevented him from carrying out his plan, and only three of the six sonatas were completed and published by Durand, with a dedication to his second wife, Emma Bardac. Sonatas =Sonata for cello and piano= The sonata for cello and piano, L. 135, was written in 1915, and is notable for its brevity, most performances not exceeding 11 minutes. It is a staple of the modern cello repertoire and is commonly regarded as one of the finest masterpieces written for the instrument. The work has three movements: *I. Prologue: Lent, sostenuto e molto risoluto *II. S√©r√©nade: Mod√©r√©ment anim√© *III. Finale: Anim√©, l√©ger et nerveux The two final movements are joined by an attacca. Instead of sonata form, Debussy structures the piece in the style of the eighteenth-century monothematic sonata, and was particularly influenced by the music of Fran√ßois Couperin. The piece makes use of modes and whole-tone and pentatonic scales, as is typical of Debussy's style. It also utilises many types of extended cello technique, including left-hand pizzicato, spiccato and flautando bowing, false harmonics and portamenti. The piece is considered technically demanding. Whether descriptive comments related to characters of the Commedia dell'arte were actually given by Debussy to cellist Louis Rosoor remains unclear.Moray Welsh. ¬´ Behind the Moon-eyed Mask ¬ª.

The first performance of the Sonata took place in Boston, at Jordan Hall in the New England Conservatory, on November 7, 1916. The performers were members of a wind ensemble called the Longy Club, which had been founded by the principal oboist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, George Longy. The first performance in France was a private one that occurred on December 10, 1916, at the home of Debussy's publisher, Jacques Durand.Nichols, Roger: The Life of Debussy (2001) p 158 The first public performance in France was thought to be at a charity concert on March 9, 1917. However, Thompson (1968) reported a performance of the sonata at London's Aeolian Hall by Albert Fransella, Harry Waldo Warner and Miriam Timothy on 2 February 1917 as part of a concert otherwise given by the London String Quartet. A typical performance lasts between 17 and 18 minutes. According to L√©on Vallas (1929),Cited in Debussy initially planned this as a piece for flute, oboe and harp. He subsequently decided that the viola's timbre would be a better combination for the flute than the oboe's, so he changed the instrumentation to flute, viola and harp. The instrumentation would later become a standard ensemble instrumentation. The work has three movements: *I. Pastorale: Lento, dolce rubato *II. Interlude: Tempo di Minuetto *III. Finale: Allegro moderato ma risoluto =Sonata for violin and piano= The sonata for violin and piano in G minor, L. 140, was written in 1917. It was the composer's last major composition and is notable for its brevity; a typical performance lasts about 13 minutes. The premiere took place on 5 May 1917, the violin part played by Gaston Poulet, with Debussy himself at the piano. It was his last public performance.Sleeve note of the Supraphon CD (SU 3547-2 101) The work has three movements: # Allegro vivo # Interm√®de: Fantasque et l√©ger # Finale: Tr√®s anim√© =The unfinished sonatas= Debussy wrote in the manuscript of his violin sonata that the fourth sonata should be written for oboe, horn, and harpsichord,L√©on Vallas Claude Debussy et son temps. √©d.

He is believed to have ruled the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) for a short period. Yashovarman was a son of the Chandela king Madanavarman. He is mentioned in the Bateshvar inscription of his own son Paramardi-deva, but other Chandela inscriptions do not mention his name in the list of Chandela kings. According to historian S. K. Mitra, the Bateshvar inscription clearly indicates that Yashovarman ascended the Chandela throne, even if for a very short period. It describes Yashovarman as \\"an ornament of great rulers causing joy to the people\\". Mitra theorizes that the other inscriptions omit his name because his short reign did not see any notable achievement. Historian R. K. Dikshit, on the other hand, believes that the epithet \\"ornament of great rulers\\" is mere rhetoric. There is hardly any difference between the last known date of Yashovarman's father Madanavarman (1063 CE) and the earliest known date of his son Paramardi-deva (1066 CE). The inscriptions other than the Bateshvar inscription, including those issued by Paramardi, suggest that Paramardi succeeded Madanvarman. It is possible that Yashovarman died while his father Madanvarman was still alive. According to the medieval legendary text Paramala Raso, Paramardi ascended the Chandela throne at the age of 5 years, which suggests that Yashovarman died prematurely.

The provision of maternal health services in each state can prevent and reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality and fetal death. The maternal healthcare system in Texas has undergone legislative changes in funding and the provision of family planning and abortion services, in relation to other states in the United States. The system in Texas has also received attention in regards to the state's maternal mortality ratio, currently the highest in the United States. Maternal deaths have steadily increased in Texas from 2010, with more than 30 deaths occurring for every 100,000 live births in 2014. The diverse demography of Texas has been identified as one factor contributing to this mortality rate, with mortality being higher among ethnic minorities such as African-American and Hispanic women. In 2013, Texas legislation established the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force to begin investigating the causes of the maternal mortality rates in the state as well as suggesting ways in which it could be reduced or averted.  Family Planning Services  In the late 1900s, the importance of family planning services captured the attention of healthcare professionals and policy makers. The recognition that unintentional pregnancies had adverse health outcomes for mothers and increased costs of maternal and infant care coupled with ethical considerations led to the passage of Title X in 1970 and the creation of federal- and state-funded family planning programs. Under Title X funding in Texas, family planning organizations participate in the 340B drug-pricing program, which reduces contraception costs by 50‚Äì80%. Under Title X regulations, clinics are also allowed to provide confidential family planning services to adolescents. = Contraception and Screening = In 2007, the Health and Human Services Commission of Texas established the Women's Health Program (WHP), a Medicaid waiver program that received 90% of its funding from the federal level. The Program provided family planning services for women from the ages of 18‚Äì44 whose incomes were 185% below the federal poverty level. 325x325px In September 2011, the program served ~119,000 low-income women. In December 2011, the state of Texas established legislation that excluded family planning providers affiliated with abortion services, such as Planned Parenthood clinics, from the WHP. As a result, the federal government ruled this as a violation of federal law, and in March 2012, discontinued federal funding for the WHP. The WHP was then replaced with a program that was 100% funded by revenue from the state of Texas. The exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from the WHP was found to be associated with a reduced use of contraception by clients. After the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from the WHP, the claims in Planned Parenthood clinics for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) reduced by 35.5% and the claims for injectable contraceptives reduced by 31.1%. After the exclusion, there was also found to be an increase in childbirth covered under Medicaid from 7.0% to 8.4% in the counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates. In addition to the Women's Health Program, from September 2010 to August 2011, the Texas Department of State Health Services allocated $49.3 million in funding to private, public, and Planned Parenthood affiliated clinics through Title X, V, and XX funding to provide family planning services. In September 2011, preceding the exclusion of programs from WHP, the state of Texas reduced its family planning funding from $111.0 million to $37.9 million through the removal of Title V and Title XX block grants. The funds were re-allocated away from family planning providers to other state and federal programs. With the remaining funding, family planning programs were organized into a 3-tiered system, with public agencies and federally funded health centers (tier 1) being prioritized over agencies that provided family planning services as a part of primary care (tier 2) and those that specialized in the provision of family planning services (tier 3). The reduction of the budget for family planning services and the creation of three-tiered program was associated with the closing of 82 family-planning clinics, with one third of the clinics being Planned Parenthood affiliates. Without subsidized aid, fewer clinics were able to afford contraception, and as a result, reduced access to IUDs and implants for patients. Clinics also began to reduce their service hours. With the loss of funding, clinics lost their participation in the 340B drug-pricing program, which had reduced contraception costs from 50 ‚Äì 80%. Clinics also lost their exemption status from a Texas law requiring parental consent for provision of family planning services to adolescents. Family planning organizations reported a 41‚Äì92% reduction in clients after the reduction and reallocation of family planning funding. The changes in family planning funding and exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from the WHP did not seem to affect screening and counseling services. Services such as cervical cancer screening, chlamydia and gonorrhea screening, and HIV testing continue to be offered at private and public clinics.  Prenatal and Postpartum Care  Prenatal care is a form of preventative health care that aims to reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality and fetal defects and death. Women's access to prenatal care services is dependent on and can be limited by their socioeconomic status or region of residency. One study conducted in 2010 through interviews of low-income women living in San Antonio, Texas, showed how those with limited education or in singly inhabited houses initiated prenatal care services later in their pregnancies. The women reported \\"service-related\\" barriers as the number one reason for not initiating prenatal care services. Postpartum care is the provision of healthcare services upon delivery and mirrors prenatal care services. Postpartum care is offered both for the physical and mental repercussions that may result after delivery. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System is one way of gauging the mental health of women after delivery, and is used by hospitals in the state of Texas. In 2003, Texas passed the Postpartum Depression to Pregnant Women Act, requiring healthcare professionals to equip women with information on accessing organizations that provide counseling and postpartum guidance. This act also urged the consideration of insurance coverage and other economic factors in providing women with postpartum care. Regarding one area of postpartum care, a study conducted in 2014 surveyed women living in Austin and El Paso, Texas on their preferred method of contraception six months after delivery and compared it with their current contraception use. The surveys found that while women preferred to use LARC methods of contraception, they were unable to use or access them at the time. Postpartum contraception has been deemed an integral part of the maternal healthcare system, especially because 61% of all unwanted pregnancies occur for women who have undergone delivery at least once.  Maternal Mortality  Maternal Mortality Rate by Race-Ethnicity, Texas 2007‚Äì2011 According to the World Health Organization, maternal mortality is defined as \\"the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.\\"World Health Organization. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision. Geneva (Switzerland): World Health Organization; 1992. The maternal mortality rates in Texas have been a source of concern as well as much discussion. From 2000 to 2010, the maternal mortality rate in Texas increased from 17.7 (for every 100,000 live births) to 18.6. It must be noted that during this period, in 2006, Texas included the consideration of pregnancy on its death certificate. However, this was not seen to visibly affect the maternal mortality rates in the ten-year time period. After 2010, the maternal mortality rate doubled, exceeding 35 between 2010 and 2014 and remaining higher than 30 in 2014. In the US, from 1987 to 2009, the leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths included hemorrhage, sepsis, and hyperintensive disorders. From 2006 to 2009, these causes changed, with cardiovascular conditions accounting for more than a third of pregnancy- related deaths. While research is ongoing on the causes of maternal mortality in Texas, maternal mortality in the US has been linked to chronic health conditions in women. Cardiovascular conditions were shown to account for at least one third of pregnancy-related deaths. Behavioral factors, such as smoking, overdoses, and suicide have also shown to be present in a high frequency during the period of pregnancy and postpartum period. Similarly, depression and anxiety have been prevalent in women during the postpartum period. In Texas, African-American women are at the highest risk of maternal death. In 2013, the Senate Bill 495 passed, leading to the establishment of the Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force to assess the factors contributing to maternal death in the state and suggest measures to reducing its incidence. In the 2016 Biennial Report, the Task Force identified cardiac event, drug overdose, hypertension, hemorrhage, and sepsis as being the top five factors contributing to maternal death in Texas. Since opioids are the most common method of drug abuse in Texas, the Task Force has initiated the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Prevention Pilot to reduce the incidence of this syndrome in newborns resulting from maternal opioid use. The Task Force is also working toward extending the number of days after delivery to which a woman in the Healthy Texas Women program can access health services. Other initiatives the Task Force has worked on include The Texas Collaborative for Healthy Mothers and Babies, which enables the delivery of postpartum health services to women while raising awareness of maternal and infant mortality. Other programs such as Someday Starts Now and Preconception Peer Education, work to raise community awareness of maternal morbidity and mortality, and are specifically targeted to minority populations of childbearing age. The Task Force is planning to allocate Title V funding to these programs and thus strengthen community health and awareness of maternal mortality and morbidity.

Coward 1926‚Äì56 Coward found the property after placing an advert in the Kentish Times and receiving only one reply. Initially renting the farm from a Mr Body, Coward bought it in 1927. In extensive rebuilding and renovation in 1927‚Äì9, he linked together \\"the farmhouse, the square edifice, one of the barns and an adjoining cottage\\" to create a substantial country house. He wrote Cavalcade at Goldenhurst in 1931. During the Second World War the house was requisitioned by the Army and Coward moved temporarily to White Cliffs, a house he rented at St Margaret's Bay. He finally returned to Goldenhurst in December 1951, recording in his diary; \\"We arrived at 1.55 - the house and land seemed to envelop me in a warm and lovely welcome. We spent the day hanging more pictures etc. Utterly exhausted but deeply and profoundly happy. I am home again.\\" But the post-war tax regime made the expense of running the large house increasingly burdensome, Coward writing to Lawrence Olivier in 1957; \\"Goldenhurst (five gardeners all year round, lighting, heat etc.) was costing a fortune.\\" He therefore sold the house, and his London home in Gerald Road, in 1956 and moved abroad for tax reasons, dividing his time between Les Avants in Switzerland and, firstly Bermuda, and then Firefly, his home in Jamaica. Description The house is timber-framed, of brick and Kentish ragstone, with a tiled roof. Now sub-divided again, part of the house is home to the comedian and novelist Julian Clary.

January February On 22 February, Jund al-Aqsa captured the village of Rasm al-Nafal, to the southwest of Lake Jabbul, severing the Ithriyah-Khanasser Highway again for the second time in 5 months. Soon afterwards, the Syrian Army deployed reinforcements to the village from the town of Al-Safira, to recapture it and reopen the key supply route. By the next day, ISIL had also captured multiple villages along the southern shore of Lake Jabbul and to the south of Rasm al-Nafal, sealing off more of the Aleppo road. Although the Syrian Army managed to recapture a number of points on the highway, they were still unable to expel the Syrian rebel and ISIL forces from the vast majority of the villages that they had seized. ISIL forces also captured a point on the Sheikh Hilal-Ithriyah Road, shutting down that highway as well. Later on 23 February, it was reported that ISIL captured the strategic town of Khanasser, advancing further along the Ithriya-Khanasser Highway. On 25 February, the Army launched a large-scale counterattack, dislodging ISIL from the town of Khanasir, which had been captured by the militants two days earlier. The counter-attack concluded 29 February 2016, when the Syrian Arab Army re-opened a supply route to Aleppo city. March On 20 March, ISIL forces started an assault on the Sheikh Najjar Industrial District, capturing the villages of Kafr Saghir and Babinnis. By 22 March, however, the Syrian Army managed to repel the ISIL offensive and regain control over the two villages. April May June :See also 2016 Aleppo summer campaign (June‚ÄìSeptember 2016) On 25 June, the Syrian army and allied forces began their long-awaited North-west Aleppo offensive.

On 11 July, Jabhat Al-Nusra launched an offensive inside Aleppo city capturing 10 buildings near the Al-Morour building (police station); however, this offensive was repelled and the SAA retook control of all lost buildings. On 17 July, the Syrian Army reached and captured the Castello highway, tightening the blockade of the rebel-held eastern Aleppo. On 27 July, the Army officially declared it had cut off all rebel supply routes into Aleppo. Following the implementation of the siege, Syrian President Bashar Assad offered a general amnesty to militants who surrender to the government authorities in the next three months. Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that President Putin ordered a large-scale humanitarian operation outside Aleppo ‚Äùto help civilians who were taken hostage by terrorists as well as fighters who wanted to lay down the arms.‚Äù Shoigu also mentioned that three humanitarian corridors as well as food and first aid points will be offered outside the city. The rebels prevented residents from fleeing through humanitarian corridors, with only a few residents being able to leave encircled opposition-held districts. Pro- opposition sources claimed two young men were shot by Army snipers while they were trying to cross through the humanitarian crossings. August See 2016 Aleppo summer campaign (June‚ÄìSeptember 2016) September See 2016 Aleppo summer campaign (June‚ÄìSeptember 2016) On 22 September, airstrikes were conducted on five districts of Aleppo. By the next day, due to the continues airstrikes, whole neighborhoods were in flames. Meanwhile, the Army made ground advances in the north and south of the city.27 casualties in massacres carried out by Russian warplanes and helicopters in Aleppo city On 24 September, the airstrikes continued, while the Army advanced in the Handarat Camp district and near the Aleppo citadel. By the end of the day, government troops withdrew from the Handarat Camp. Om 25 September, government forces secured the Shaher district and launched a new assault on the Handarat Camp. On 27 September, airstrikes hit two hospitals, while the Army captured the Farafira district. On 28 September, government troops advanced in the al- Suweiqa district of Old Aleppo. On 29 September, the Army took control of the Handarat Camp district and subsequently attacked the Kindi hospital, which had been made into a rebel base, as well as the nearby Shaqayf district. On 30 September, government forces seized the Kindi hospital, while \\"back and forth\\" fighting took place in the central Suleiman Al-Halabi district.

A single F420H2 dehydrogenase (also referred to as F420H2:quinol oxidoreductase) from the methanogenic archaeon, Methanosarcina mazei G√∂1, has been shown to be a redox driven proton pump. The F420H2DH of M. mazei has a molecular size of about 120 kDa and contains Fe-S clusters and FAD. A similar five-subunit enzyme has been isolated from Methanolobus tindarius. The sulfate-reducing Archaeoglobus fulgidus (and several other archaea) also have this enzyme.  Function  Reduction of 2-hydroxyphenazine by F420H2DH is accompanied by the translocation of 1 H+ per 2 electrons transferred. = Transport Reaction = The overall vectorial reaction catalyzed by F420H2DH is : Reduced donor (2e‚àí) + H+ (in) ‚áå oxidized acceptor (2e‚àí) + H+ (out) = Role in Methanogenesis = Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis has been isolated from the human gut and requires H2 and methanol or methylamines to produce methane. The organism lacks cytochromes, indicating that it cannot couple membrane-bound electron transfer reactions with the extrusion of protons or sodium ions using other known methanogenic pathways. Furthermore, M. luminyensis contains a soluble MvhAGD/HdrABC complex, as found in obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogens, but the energy conserving methyltransferase (MtrA-H) is absent. Evidence has been presented that M. luminyensis uses two types of heterodisulfide reductases (HdrABC and HdrD) in an energy conserving process. RT-qPCR studies revealed that genes coding for both heterodisulfide reductases were expressed at high levels. Other genes with high transcript abundance were fpoA as part of the operon encoding the 'headless' F420H2 dehydrogenase and atpB as part of the operon encoding the A1Ao ATP synthase. High activities of the soluble heterodisulfide reductase HdrABC and the hydrogenase MvhADG were found in the cytoplasm. Also, heterologously produced HdrD could reduce CoM-S-S-CoB using reduced methylviologen as electron donor. It is proposed that membrane-bound electron transfer is based on the conversion of two molecules of methanol and the concurrent formation of two molecules of the heterodisulfide CoM-S-S-CoB. First, the HdrABC/MvhADG complex catalyzes the H2-dependent reduction of CoM- S-S-CoB and the formation of reduced ferredoxin. Second, reduced ferredoxin is oxidized by the 'headless' F420H2 dehydrogenase, thereby translocating up to 4 H+ across the membrane, and electrons are channeled to HdrD for the reduction of the second heterodisulfide.  Homology  The gene cluster encoding the F420H2DH includes 12 genes, fpoABCDHIJKLMNO. Several of the subunits are related to those of the mitochondrial 'complex I' NDH family members (TC# 3.D.1). Thus, the gene products, FpoA, H, J, K, L, M and N, are highly hydrophobic and are homologous to subunits that form the membrane integral module of NDH-1. FpoB, C, D and I have their counterparts in the amphipathic membrane-associated module of NDH-1. However, homologues of the hydrophilic subunits of the NADH-oxidizing complex are absent.

Biography Born to Jewish family, Kay moved to the United States from Vilnius at the age of 10. At the age of 12 he dropped out of Washington Elementary School on July 4, 1909 and began working at a grocery store due to a tough financial situation at home. A few years later, he managed to save up enough money to purchase his own grocery store. After returning home from being a sergeant in World War I, Kay married his wife, Minnie, and founded the District Grocery Society renamed District Grocery Stores (DGS) in 1928. Thanks to the money made from the grocery organization, in the 1930s Kay bought land in the Silver Spring area in Maryland, thus leading the way to forming the Kay Construction Company in 1936. For the first time, he made it possible for Jews to join the Indian Spring Golf and Country Club in 1939, though African- Americans and other non-white minorities were still excluded from membership until the mid-1960s. Until the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, Kay used racially restrictive covenants to exclude African Americans and other racial minorities. Kay has earned much recognition for being involved in other groups such as being chairman for the team that purchased . This was the ship that tried to bring Jewish immigrants to Palestine in 1947. He also supported a rehabilitation center at Nahariya for disabled Israeli military veterans. It is funded by the Abe S. Kay Foundation, Inc. which he was president of. Just a month before he died, Kay donated 350,000 dollars to the American University to build the Kay Spiritual Life Center, forming the first interfaith chapel on its campus.

As it only continued in existence for seven years, it is now regarded primarily as a short-lived precursor to the Northumbrian Pipers' Society. However, despite its short life, it played a significant role, publishing the first tutor for the instrument, J. W. Fenwick's Instruction Book for the Northumbrian Small-Pipes (1896), holding regular meetings, and organising annual competitions. In 1894 and 1896-7, the society published Transactions, as well as publishing an account of their Annual Meeting of 1897. As well as Members, who paid an annual 5s. subscription, there was a category of Honorary Playing Members. Since the society's records include the names and addresses of all members, of either kind, they have listed the names and addresses for 37 known pipers. Two articles in the Newcastle Courant, in April 1900, gave an account of their Annual General Meeting, at the Literary and Philosophical Society, and referred to the society as flourishing, with 200 members, of whom almost half were pipers. Newcastle Courant, April 7th, 1900, recovered from British Newspaper Archive. Officers were elected for the following year; however there is no subsequent record of any formal activity of the society, such as meetings or competitions. In 1906, when the Cloughs played for King Edward VII at Alnwick Castle, an account of this in the Berwickshire News stated that the Northumbrian Small Pipes Society had done some good work in reviving interest, but that 'seven winters had passed without it giving any signs of life' Berwickshire News and General Advertiser, July 17th 1906.. This suggests that the society had been largely inactive for some time before its final AGM. The same week as the final meeting, a group of pipers, including Henry Clough and Richard Mowat, organised a gathering of pipers and their friends at The Black Horse in Monkseaton, showing that pipers themselves had begun to organise events in parallel to the society; the 1900 meeting was chaired by Walter Corder, secretary of the NSPS. Newcastle Courant, April 14th, 1900, recovered from British Newspaper Archive. This was the second such meeting, the first having been the previous May. Morpeth Herald, May 13th 1899. These events were described as 'annual', but there are no subsequent newspaper accounts of these until an informal gathering there in 1906. Morpeth Herald, March 24th, 1906, recovered from British Newspaper Archive. Historical context The late 19th century in Northumberland was a period of growing interest in Northumbrian music in general, and the music of the Northumbrian smallpipes in particular. In the 1850s, the Society of Antiquaries had started to collect tune and song manuscripts, and their Ancient Melodies Committee continued its work over the subsequent years. In the 1870s, that Society organised annual piping competitions, both to encourage pipers, and to reward the ablest among them. In 1882, the Northumbrian Minstrelsy was published, placing some of their researches before a wider public, and the second part of this book was devoted specifically to smallpipe tunes. So by 1893, the intellectual climate was ripe for the foundation of a society specifically devoted to the Northumbrian Smallpipes themselves. The Membership A large group of the 26 Committee members, only one of whom, J. W. Fenwick, was an Honorary Playing Member, were related to one another, being members of the extended group of Foster, Spence, Corder, and Watson families; a significant group of these were close neighbours in or near Rosella Place, a short Georgian terrace in North Shields.Rosella Place and the Northumbrian Small Pipes Society, Journal of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, vol.32, p 19, 2011. This Quaker family were descendants of Robert Foster, a close friend of Thomas Bewick. Although there is no direct evidence, it is very likely that Robert would have heard the piping of Thomas's son Robert Bewick, and the family's interest in piping, apparent across several generations, may well date from this time. One significant member was the artist Joseph Crawhall II (1821‚Äì1896), who had a deep interest in the culture and music of Northumberland, and had published A Beuk o' Newcassell Sangs in 1888. He had compiled a tunebook for the use of pipers, containing tunes copied from the William Vickers manuscript, as well as tunes from oral tradition, some otherwise unknown. Parts of this are now on the FARNE archive. He corresponded with his friend and collaborator, the illustrator Charles Keene, who was also a Northumbrian piper - letters surviving from Keene to Crawhall confirm that both of them had had dealings with James Reid, the son of Robert Reid, whose business he continued. In one of these letters, Keene refers to seeing the pipes of Tommy Hair, on sale in Reid's shop in December 1873.James Reid, 1814-74: Clothing the Bare Facts, Richard Heard and Graham Wells, Journal of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, vol. 34, 2013-14, p.19. Another committee member was Charles James Spence. He was a banker and a serious amateur artist, and an active member of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, being their Curator of Museums from 1890-1905. He owned a rare, possibly unique, set of six-drone pipes by Reid, and an illustration of these is the frontispiece of Fenwick's tutor. It is not known whether his interest in these was as an antiquarian, or as a player, but he is not listed as a playing member, suggesting he did not consider himself to be a serious piper. Alternatively, it may be that as a man of some means, he felt obliged to pay the subscription. He designed the medal which was awarded to first prize winners in the society's annual competitions, and the artwork illustrating the society's Transactions. In its lifetime the society awarded two pipers its Gold Medal; one was Richard Mowat, and the other was Henry Clough.Piping Past, reprinted obituary by Gilbert Askew, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v.2 7, 2006. A cousin of his, Robert Spence Watson had had a strong interest in piping more than a decade earlier, and had donated the Spence Watson trophy, then worth ¬£25, for the series of competitions organised by the Society of Antiquaries in Newcastle Town Hall. This was won outright by Old Tom Clough after three victories, in 1879. Robert's daughter Mary Spence Watson, herself an amateur piper, who had learned from Richard Mowat, corresponded with Old Tom's grandson Tom Clough. That trophy is now in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum. The president of the society was Richard Welford. In 1896 he delivered a lecture to the society on 'The Waits of Newcastle upon Tyne'. As the last of the Waits was John Peacock, Welford must have had at least some interest in Northumbrian pipes. After Fenwick's death, he acquired Fenwick's collection of manuscript music, which still survives, and includes many unusual variants of traditional pipe tunes, some with attributions to named pipers, including Peacock and Robert Reid. Why was the society so short-lived? The reasons for the society's short life are not documented. However, it is clear that with a committee of 26, only one of whom was an honorary playing member, and only 37 honorary playing members across the lifetime of the society, never more than 35 at any time, it may well be that pipers felt that the work of the society was not really about the living tradition of the instrument as it was currently played, so much as an antiquarian interest in preserving an instrument falsely perceived as being on the point of extinction. Such attitudes were certainly current when the Northumbrian Pipers' Society was founded, 30 years later, and it is known from Tom Clough's letters that Tom, and perhaps also his father Henry, were initially cautious and even suspicious.The Clough Family of Newsham, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, ed. Chris Ormston and Julia Say, (2000). Henry was elected by the NPS as one of the vice-presidents, though he did not play a very active role. Certainly the newer Society had much more involvement from pipers themselves; Tom himself acted as a Competition judge in the first three years, though he declined to be a vice-president, stating that doing the work properly would require more of his time than he could spare. It is more likely that his personal disagreements with G.V.B. Charlton, the first president of the new society, played a large role in this decision. Another piper who played a major part in the NPS early on was Richard Mowat, its chairman from 1933 until his death. In the same year, Tom was also elected as a vice- president, as Billy Pigg had been in 1930. The newer society, as its name suggests, thus had far more involvement from pipers themselves than its short- lived predecessor, and this difference may explain why it survived, while the NSPS did not.

Typical Hasami porcelain uses underglaze cobalt blue and celadon, but at first they produced stonewares. Later the materials for porcelain were found, so gradually they started to make porcelain. They eventually became a specialty product in Omura Domain, where they produced the biggest quantity of porcelain in the country in the latter Edo period. Omura Domain established a Sarayama public office to manage and put more effort to manufacturing Hasami porcelain. Most of their products are for the daily usage such as Kurawanka-wan. It is one of the most well- known Hasami porcelain, which is a strong, heavy and simple bowl of arabesque design for common people. Hasami porcelain gave a strong influence on food culture at that time. Hasami porcelains are produced in the huge climbing kiln and because of its economical prices, spread around the country and eventually all over the world.

He was an honorary member of various labor organizations and he improved living conditions and planned social assistance, according to modern trends in his \\"Hacienda Higuereta\\", building houses for workers and employees; endowing the negotiation of sports fields, venue for film shows. The Hacienda was in some ways a small town with homes for the employees and their families, a school, a movie theater with mezzanine for trusted employees, a park, a wood shed, a machine shop a pool, soccer fields, a chapel, a bodega, public restrooms and of course the buildings where the wine and pisco were crushed, distilled and aged. Don Venturo worked with organizations to provide the population with the abundant food and elements of sports and healthy recreation. He was a member of the Wine Committee of the National Agrarian Society and organizer of the Advisory Mission, in 1930, to study the law of alcoholic beverages and promotion of national viticulture. He organized the first Harvest Festival in Peru called \\"La Vendimia\\", chairing the Organizing Committee in 1937 in Santiago de Surco. La Vendimia Wine Festival continues today.

In 1967 General Juan Velasco Alvarado took power with armed forces in a coup d'√âtat against President Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry During General Velasco's reign from 1968 to 1975, he restructured parts of Peru. One of his mandates was an agrarian reform program to expropriate farms and diversify land ownership, much of which had been concentrated in Haciendas' owned by a small percentage of the population. Hacienda Higuereta was on his target. Under new Peruvian government law any hacienda that is not producing what the quota mandates must be destroyed. Hacienda Higuereta was ordered to be torn down.

It was founded in 2005 and is best known for its shade measurement tool, the SunEye, and its I-V curve tracer, the PV Analyzer. The award-winning SunEye shade tool is used primarily by residential solar installers. It tells the user when and where shadows will fall so that solar modules can be placed to maximize energy harvest. The PV Analyzer is an I-V curve tracer. It is used for commissioning and troubleshooting commercial and utility scale PV systems. History Solmetric was founded by Willard MacDonald, Robert MacDonald, and Mark Galli in 2005. The company was to produce a device to predict and analyze the shade at a potential solar installation site. Solmetric became a certified B Corporation in 2009. In 2013., The firm was one of the 63 B Corporations listed as Best for The World Environmental Impact Honorees. In January 2014 the firm was acquired by residential installer and solar financier, Vivint Solar for $12 million.  Products  The SunEye-100 was introduced at SolFest in Hopland, California in 2006, to replace the Solar Pathfinder as a device previously used to measure shade . Shade measurements became a particularly important when the California Solar Initiative program began requiring shade measurements in 2006 and solar companies began providing third party financing of solar systems. The product received the 2007 Top 10 Green Building Products of the Year award from US based Building Green, the 2nd place Innovation Award at the 2008 European PV Solar Energy Tradeshow in Staffelstein Germany, and the 2009 Trophy of Innovation from Salon des √©nergies renouvelables at Eurexpo in Lyon, France. By 2010 it was the primary tool used by residential solar companies for surveying shade. A subsequent version, the SunEye-210 added a fisheye camera, digital compass, digital inclinometer, and GPS. It captures an image of the sky including the horizon, superimposes the sunpaths on top of the image, and calculates the solar access for that location. The PV Designer layout and simulation software product was first introduced in 2009 at Solar Power International. The software enables the user to layout PV modules on a roof virtually and simulate the energy production. The PV Analyzer I-V curve tracer (‚ÄúPVA-600‚Äù) was introduced in 2010 and could measure strings up to 600 volts and 20 amps. The PVA-1000, introduced in 2013, added 1000 volt, 30 amp capability as well as the SolSensor wireless PV reference which measures the irradiance and module temperature. . The PVA simultaneously measures the irradiance and module temperature with the SolSensor Wireless PV Reference Sensor. It is used primarily for commissioning and troubleshooting PV systems .

Eddy Goldfarb & Associates, and published by Epyx for the Commodore 64. The game was unveiled in June 1984, at Chicago's Summer Consumer Electronics Show, and was released later that year. Hot Wheels is the first video game to be based on the Hot Wheels toyline, and was marketed by Epyx as part of their Computer Activity Toys series, consisting of video games based on popular toylines. Gameplay Hot Wheels begins with the player choosing a vehicle. The player can choose from one of several Hot Wheels vehicles, or can choose to create a custom vehicle instead. Custom vehicles are created by the player in a factory, where the player chooses the design of the vehicle's front, middle, and rear sections. Once a vehicle has been selected, the player can drive around a side-scrolling city filled with various minigames and activities, including a speedway, where the player can race against three computer-controlled opponents; an expressway, where the player can watch the chosen vehicle drive itself; Bob's Gas, where the player controls a mechanic and must refuel the vehicle and check its tires; a car wash, where the vehicle can be cleaned after becoming dirty from driving; a parking lot, where the player can park the vehicle; and Super Tuner, where the player can have the vehicle's engine checked. Another minigame allows the player to take control of a firetruck, with the objective being to extinguish a fire. Reception Robert J. Sodaro of The Guide to Computer Living praised the game for its diversity and its \\"fun\\" feature of painting vehicles, and wrote, \\"The detail accomplished in the graphics of this game are some of the best I've ever seen\\". Roy Wagner of Computer Gaming World wrote that Hot Wheels \\"isn't so hot,\\" writing that it was \\"geared for the younger crowd of about seven.\\" AllGame gave Hot Wheels three stars out of five. Computer Gamer wrote, \\"On the whole this is a great game for younger kids, anybody over about 11 would find it very tiring and repetitive after only a few plays. And as there is no score as such to compare against every time you play, there is no on-going challenge. The game is obviously designed for younger players and as such is excellent at what it does. [...] Good presentation, good sound and graphics, good for kids but nobody else.\\" Zzap!64 gave the game a 40 percent overall rating and called it, \\"A game for the very young or those wishing to reminisce about the 'good old days'.\\" Zzap!64 called the graphics, \\"Bright and jovial but not very well drawn,\\" and praised the \\"Reasonable tunes\\", but criticized the game for a lack of interesting and long-lasting gameplay: \\"Quite jolly for an hour or so. But after that there's little to do.\\" Ken McMahon of Commodore User gave the game a rating of 5 out of 10 and praised the ability to build a custom vehicle, calling it \\"quite good fun.\\" However, McMahon wrote, \\"Getting the car on the road was the only part I really enjoyed. After that things got a bit mundane.

Amateur Sobot became Croatian amateur champion in 1994 defeating Stjepan Bo≈æiƒá by split decision. Pro Sobot's debut came on January 7, 1995, with a knockout of Bosnian, Savo Jankovic. On 1 March 1996, Sobot fought and defeated Orhan Ajvazoski for the German International middleweight title in Frankfurt and went on to make two more successful defences in the city and later two more in Offenbach and Oberhausen. After nine wins, Sobot successfully fought for the IBF Inter- Continental middleweight title, defeating experienced title holder Salvador Yanez. Sobots next major challenge came on January 25, 1997, when he faced future world champion Hacine Cherifi for the EBU (European) middleweight title.

It was the dominant long line of French poetry from the 17th through the 19th century, and influenced many other European literatures which developed alexandrines of their own. 12th to 15th centuries =Genesis= According to verse historian Mikhail Gasparov, the French alexandrine developed from the Ambrosian octosyllable, √ó ‚Äì u ‚Äì √ó ‚Äì u √ó Aeterne rerum conditor by gradually losing the final two syllables, √ó ‚Äì u ‚Äì √ó ‚Äì Aeterne rerum cond (construct) then doubling this line in a syllabic context with phrasal stress rather than length as a marker. =Rise and decline= Alexander the Great in a diving bell: a scene from the line's namesake, the Roman d'Alexandre. The earliest recorded use of alexandrines is in the Medieval French poem Le P√®lerinage de Charlemagne of 1150, but the name derives from their more famous use in part of the Roman d'Alexandre of 1170. L. E. Kastner states: > From about the year 1200 the Alexandrine began to supplant the decasyllabic > line as the metre of the chansons de geste, and at the end of the thirteenth > century it had gained so completely the upper hand as the epic line that > several of the old chansons in the decasyllabic line were turned into > Alexandrines... These early alexandrines were slightly looser rhythmically than those reintroduced in the 16th century. Significantly, they allowed an \\"epic caesura\\" ‚Äî an extrametrical mute e at the close of the first hemistich (half- line), as examplified in this line from the medieval Li quatre fils Aymon: o o o o o S(e) o o o o o S Or sunt li quatre fr√®re  sus el palais plenier o=any syllable; S=stressed syllable; (e)=optional mute e; =caesura However, toward the end of the 14th century, the line was \\"totally abandoned, being ousted by its old rival the decasyllabic\\"; and despite occasional isolated attempts, would not regain its stature for almost 200 years. 16th to 18th centuries The alexandrine was resurrected in the middle of the 16th century by the poets of the Pl√©iade, notably √âtienne Jodelle (tragedy), Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas (narrative), Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf (lyric), and Pierre de Ronsard. Later, Pierre Corneille introduced its use in comedy. It was metrically stricter, allowing no epic caesura: o o o o o S  o o o o o S (e) Pierre Corneille Typically, each hemistich also holds one secondary accent which may occur on any of the first five syllables, most frequently on the third; this frequently balanced four-part structure resulted in one of several monikers for the line: ' (in contradistinction to the ' or ' described below). Often called the \\"classical alexandrine\\", ', or ', it became the dominant long line of French verse up to the end of the 19th century, and was \\"elevated to the status of national symbol and eventually came to typify French poetry overall\\". The classical alexandrine is always rhymed. The ' (rule of alternation of rhymes), which was a tendency in some poets before the Pl√©iade, was \\"firmly established by Ronsard in the sixteenth century and rigorously decreed by Malherbe in the seventeenth.\\" It states that \\"a masculine rime cannot be immediately followed by a different masculine rime, or a feminine rime by a different feminine rime.\\" This rule resulted in the preponderance of three rhyme schemes, though others are possible. (Masculine rhymes are given in lowercase, and feminine in CAPS): * ' or ': aaBB * ': aBaB (or AbAb) * ' aBBa (or AbbA) These lines by Corneille (with formal paraphrase) exemplify classical alexandrines with rimes suivies: Loosening strategies The classical alexandrine was early recognized as having a prose-like effect, for example by Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. This in part explains the strictness with which its prosodic rules (e.g. medial caesura and end rhyme) were kept; they were felt necessary to preserve its distinction and unity as verse. Nevertheless, several strategies for reducing the strictness of the verse form have been employed over the centuries. =Alexandrin ternaire= Although used in exceptional cases by some 17th-century French poets, Victor Hugo popularized the ' (also referred to as ') as an alternative rhythm to the classical alexandrine. His famous self-descriptive line: exemplifies the structure of the ', which preserves the medial caesura with a word break, but de-emphasizes it by surrounding it with two stronger phrase breaks after syllables four and eight: o o o S  o o ¬¶ o S  o o o S (e) =strong caesura; ¬¶=word break Although generally embraced by the French Romantics and Symbolists, the ' remained a supplemental line, used within a classical alexandrine context and forming no more than one quarter of the alexandrine lines written during this time. Passages of classical alexandrines were still written by these poets, as for example this ' quatrain by Charles Baudelaire: ='= These three similar terms (in French ' and ' are homophones) designate distinct historical strategies to introduce more prosodic variety into French verse. All three involve verse forms beyond just the alexandrine, but just as the alexandrine was chief among lines, it is the chief target of these modifications. ;'''' ' (also ', ', or ') are found in a variety of minor and hybrid genres of the 17th and 18th century. The works are composed of lines of various lengths, without regularity in distribution or order; however, each individual line is perfectly metrical, and the rule of alternation of rhymes is followed. The result is somewhat analogous to the Pindarics of Abraham Cowley. Two of the most famous works written in ' are Jean de La Fontaine's Fables and Moli√®re's Amphitryon. ;'''' ' was a mid-to-late-19th-century extension of the liberties begun to be taken by the Romantics with their embrace of the '. The liberties taken included the weakening, movement, and erasure of caesurae, and rejection of the rule of alternation of rhymes. Although writers of ' consistently continued to use rhyme, many of them accepted categories of rhyme which were previously considered \\"careless\\" or unusual. The alexandrine was not their only metrical target; they also cultivated the use of ' ‚Äî lines with an odd, rather than even, number of syllables. These uneven lines, though known from earlier French verse, were relatively uncommon and helped suggest a new rhythmic register. ;'''' ' is the source of the English term free verse, and is effectively identical in meaning. It can be seen as a radical extension of the tendencies of both ' (various and unpredictable line lengths) and ' (weakening of strictures for caesura and rhymes, as well as experimentation with unusual line lengths). Its birth ‚Äî for the reading public at least ‚Äî can be dated exactly: 1886; in this year, editor Gustave Kahn published several seminal ' poems in his review ', including poems by Arthur Rimbaud (written over a decade previously) and Jules Laforgue, with more following in the next years. ' shed all metrical and prosodic constraints, such as verse length, rhyme, and caesura; Laforgue said, \\"I forget to rhyme, I forget about the number of syllables, I forget about stanzaic structure.\\" Notes References   French poetry Types of verses ","title":"French alexandrine"},{"id":"51412729","text":"Gelanor waorani is a species of neotropical spiders from South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil) in the family Mimetidae.

After a period of intense missionary activity by the Catholic Church, Hidetada Tokugawa, the second sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa dynasty, issued a decree which banned the practice and teaching of the Christian faith, and under the threat of loss of life, all the missionaries had to leave Japan. This decree started the bloody persecution of Christians, which lasted several decades. On Amakusa, Carvalho hid in plain view, disguised as a soldier for two years, where he assimilated the Japanese language and principles of inculturation. When the local governor openly confessed that Carvalho was a missionary, and the actual purpose of his stay was to preach and convert the locals to Christianity, he was expelled from the island. With the help of fellow believers, he went to Nagasaki, where the Jesuit Provincial, Francisco Pacheco advised him to remain prudent in the implementation of the apostolate and directed him to care for a small group living in a suburban area. On 22 July 1623, as he returned from the pastoral ministry in ≈åmura, Carvalho was arrested due to an accusation from an informant. In the local prison, he joined Pedro V√°squez, Luis Sotelo, and two Japanese Franciscans, Ludovicus Sasada and tertiary Ludovicus Baba. Miguel spent his time in captivity with the celebration of daily Mass and prayer. On 24 August, a death sentence was ordered, which was performed the next day in ≈åmura. On 25 August 1624, Carvalho and his companions were burned at the stake.  Legacy  The steadfastness and joy that he showed convicts in the face of martyrdom for the faith, aroused the admiration of his contemporaries. Carvalho was beatified by Pope Pius IX on 7 July 1867.

The work was a best seller when it was first released, lasting for 72 weeks on The New York Times Bestsellers list.  Background  The book is based on a number of court cases that Nizer argued in US courts. The original papers for many of these trials are held by the Columbia Law Library.  Contents  All six cases depicted within the book are civil cases, which is unusual for legal fiction and non-fiction because of the greater sensationality of criminal law cases. The book depicts the following cases: * Baron v. Leo Feist * Reynolds v. Pegler (a landmark libel decision in which Quentin Reynolds successfully sued right-wing columnist Westbrook Pegler, resulting in a record judgment of $175,001) * Bercovici v. Chaplin (a plagiarism lawsuit in 1947 against Charlie Chaplin) * Cambell v. Loew's Inc.‚Äîwhich was presided over by judge Collins J. Seitz. * Eleanor Holm v Billy Rose * Foerster v. Ridder * Dolly Astor v. John Astor Reception The book was received favorably. Commentary magazine reviewer David T. Bazelon said he did not \\"understand why it has become a bestseller\\", but all in all \\"Properly read, it is an occasion for some real understanding of the trial man. Haphazardly or naively read, it is interesting, instructive, and even exciting.\\" Bazelon challenges praise by Max Lerner that the work is \\"one of the great legal autobiographies of our time\\". Kirkus reviews gave less praise, calling the book \\"direct and orderly\\" and enjoyable by \\"Trial lawyers, law students, and the general public\\". For the most part, academic and legal reviewers of the autobiography were particularly harsh critics of the book. In The Modern Law Review, British reviewer C.P. Harvey commented \\"I cannot help wondering what made Messrs. Heinmann think it would be good business to publish this book in [the United Kingdom].\\" He writes \\"I pronounce this book to be didactic, long-winded and pretentious\\" and describes it as an example of \\"the breadth of the ocean which lies between the English and American legal systems.\\" In the Osgoode Hall Law Journal, reviewer R. N. Starr described the work as not exactly realistic, and taken to \\"poetic license\\". His review is rather skeptical and mixed; he writes: \\"For my own part I would have preferred it, had Mr. Nizer put his wide experience to other purposes.\\" In the Yale Law Review Joseph W. Bishop lambasts the piece as demonstrating the decline of legal practice, jury tried cases, and the flaws of the legal profession. Nonetheless, he describes the book as anything but \\"dry and indigestable reading\\" which is usually the case for accounts of legal cases. Unlike other academic reviewers, American Bar Association Journal reviewer Alfred Schweppe praised the book as a \\"must for every lawyer searching for an answer to success in the courtroom\\" and the describing the style as \\"Moving with an easy finished prose\\".  Legacy  The book has inspired a number of people to become lawyers, including Laurie Levenson and Roy Black. Nizer's subsequent book The Jury Returns follows much the same format and pattern as My Life in Court, attempting to create a similar work and success. = Adaptations = The book was adapted into the 1963 Broadway play A Case of Libel. The book was also adapted into a television film. Both depict the Reynolds v. Pegler case.

Nowadays, you can even find it in some high-level restaurants in China. After the instant noodles were invented in Japan, the same method was introduced for hot and sour noodles in Sichuan. One example is Baijia Instant Noodles.  Characteristics  Its unique flavor combines the sourness from Chinese rice vinegar with the spiciness from chili pepper oil. The grounded toasted peanuts and soybeans on top of noodles gave the special texture of crispness. Besides rice vinegar, chili oil and peanuts/soybeans, other ingredients include sugar, salt, soy sauce, scallion pieces, and smashed garlic.  Preparation  The preparation for hot and sour noodles is relatively easy and quick if you have all the right ingredients handy. For these street vendors in Sichuan, it only takes 2‚Äì3 minutes to serve the noodle after taking customers orders. Basically it involves 2 stepsÔºö 1. Simmer the noodles in the boiling water. For sweet potato starch noodles, it only requires 1‚Äì2 minutes; 2.

He was the last powerful Chandela king, and ruled the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). Around 1182-1183 CE, he defeated Prithviraj Chauhan, who raided the Chandela capital Mahoba. Paramardi managed to recover the Chandela power over the next few years, but was defeated by the Ghurid general Qutb al-Din Aibak around 1202-1203 CE.  Early life  Paramardi's Bateshvar inscription suggests that he succeeded his father Yashovarman. However, other Chandela inscriptions (including those of his own) suggest that he succeeded his grandfather Madanavarman. It is possible that Yashovarman ruled for a very short period, or did not rule at all, having died while Madanavarman was still alive. According to the Parmal Raso, Paramardi ascended the throne at the age of 5 years. An Ajaygarh inscription appears to corroborate this claim: it states that Paramardi was a leader even as a child (bƒÅl-opi netƒÅ). He is mentioned as Paramardi-deva in inscriptions. The medieval bardic legends call him Paramala or Parimala. In modern vernaculars, he is also known as Paramardidev, Parmar, Paramal Deo or Parimal Chandel (because of schwa deletion). A gold coin issued by him, featuring a seated goddess, gives his name as Srimat Paramardi.

While these texts are based on historical events, much of their content has been fabricated to glorify either Prithviraj Chauhan or Paramardi. Thus, these texts are of doubtful historicity, and therefore, much of Paramardi's reign is shrouded in obscurity. Several Chandela inscriptions also mention Paramardi, but these contain little historical information. For example, the Semra copper-plate inscription vaguely eulogizes him as someonoe who surpassed Makaradhvaja (the god of love) in handsomeness, the ocean in depth, the lord of heaven in majesty, Brihaspati in wisdom, and Yudhishthira in truthfulness. The Baghari (Bateshvar) stone inscription credits him with military victories and states that other kings bowed to him, but does not name any of these kings. The Ajaygarh inscription of his grandson's wife Kalyanadevi similarly describes him as a universal sovereign, whose enemies were left in a pitiful condition. Such claims of extensive conquests are not corroborated by historical evidence. = Early career = The inscriptions from the first few years of Paramardi's reign have been found at Semra (1165-1166 CE), Mahoba (1166-1167 CE), Ichhawar (1171 CE), Mahoba (1173 CE), Pachar (1176 CE) and Charkhari (1178 CE). All of these inscriptions use the imperial titles for him: Paramabhattaraka-Maharajadhiraja-Parameshvara Parama-Maheshvara Shri- Kalanjaradhipati Shrimanmat Paramardideva. This indicates that in the early part of his reign, Paramardi retained the territories that he had inherited from his grandfather Madanavarman. An 1183 CE Mahoba inscription states that the lord of Tripuri fainted whenever he heard the songs about Paramardi's bravery. This suggests that Paramardi defeated a Kalachuri king of Tripuri, possibly Jayasimha. = Chahamana invasion = During 1182-1183 CE, the Chahamana ruler Prithviraj Chauhan invaded the Chandela kingdom of Jejakabhukti. The Chandela records do not mention this invasion, presumably to avoid describing the humiliating defeat of their king. According to the medieval ballads, Prithviraj was returning to Delhi after marrying the daughter of Padamsen. During this journey, he was attacked by Turkic forces (Ghurids). The Chauhan army managed to repulse the attacks, but suffered serious casualties in the process. They lost their way, and arrived in the Chandela capital Mahoba. The Chauhan force, which had a number of wounded soldiers among them, unknowingly set up a camp in the Chandela royal garden. They killed the keeper of the garden for objecting to their presence. When Paramardi learned about this, he sent some soldiers to counter the Chauhan force. The Chandelas suffered heavy losses in the ensuing conflict. Paramardi then decided to send another force led by his general Udal against Prithviraj. Udal advised against this proposal, arguing that it would not be appropriate to attack wounded soldiers or to antagonize a powerful king like Prithviraj. However, Paramardi was under the influence of his brother-in-law Mahil Parihar (Pratihara), who secretly harboured ill-will against the Chandelas. Mahil instigated Paramardi to go ahead with the attack plan. The Chandela force led by Udal then launched a second attack against the Chauhan army, but was defeated. The situation subsided when Prithviraj left for Delhi. Unable to bear Mahil Parihar's political scheming, Udal and his brother Alha left the Chandela court. They took shelter with Jaichand, the Gahadavala ruler of Kannauj. Mahil then sent a secret message to Prithviraj Chauhan, informing him that the best generals of Paramardi had left Mahoba. Instigated by him, Prithviraj set out from Delhi in 1182 CE and marched to the Chandela territory via Gwalior and Bateshwar. First, he besieged Sirsagarh, which was held by Malkhan, a cousin of Alha and Udal. Prithviraj tried to win over Malkhan, but Malkhan remained loyal to Paramardi and fought against the invaders. After Malkhan killed eight generals of the invading army, Prithviraj himself took charge of the battle. The Chandelas ultimately lost the battle, and Malkhan was killed. Prithviraj then started a march towards Mahoba. Facing an imminent defeat, Paramardi and his nobles sought a truce on the advice of his chief queen Malhan Devi. Prithviraj agreed to the truce, but remained encamped on the banks of the Betwa River in the Chandela territory. The Chandelas, meanwhile, requested Alha and Udal to come back from Kannauj. The two brothers were initially hesitant, but agreed to return after their mother appealed them to honour their allegiance to the Chandelas. Jaichand dispatched an army led by his best generals, including two of his own sons, to support the Chandelas. Paramardi himself became nervous, and retreated to the Kalanjara fort with some of his soldiers. His son Brahmajit, along with Alha and Udal, led the Chandela army against Prithviraj Chauhan. In the ensuing battle, the Chandelas were defeated. Brahmajit, Udal and the two sons of Jaichand were killed in the conflict. After his victory, Prithviraj sacked the Chandela capital of Mahoba. Next, Prithviraj dispatched his general Chavand Rai to Kalanjara. The Chauhan army captured the fort, took Paramardi as prisoner, and marched back towards Delhi. According to the Parmal Raso, Alha's son Indal Kumar launched a surprise attack on the returning Chauhan army, and freed Paramardi. Out of shame, Paramardi later committed suicide at the Gajraj temple. Parmal Raso states that his 50 wives committed sati (self-immolation) after his death. According to Chand Bardai, he retired to Gaya and died there. The Prithviraj Raso states that Prithviraj appointed Pajjun Rai as the governor of Mahoba. Later, Paramardi's son Samarjit recaptured Mahoba with help of Narasimha, an officer of Jaichand. Samarjit then ruled the territory between Kalanjara and Gaya. However, no such prince is mentioned in the Chandela records. The exact historicity of this legendary narrative is debatable, but it is known that Prithviraj Chauhan indeed sacked Mahoba. This is corroborated by his stone inscriptions at Madanpur. However, the prolonged occupation of Mahoba or Kalanjara by Chauhans is not supported by historical evidence. Moreover, it is known that Paramardi did not die or retire immediately after the Chauhan victory. He is known to have issued several inscriptions after this event: the Kalanjara rock inscription, the 1184 CE Mahoba stone inscription, the 1187 CE Ajaygarh stone inscription, the 1195 CE Baghari (Bateshvar) stone inscription, and the 1201 CE Kalanjara stone inscription. These records give imperial titles for Paramardi, indicating that he remained a sovereign ruler. The Muslim chronicles also provide evidence that Paramardi ruled until the beginning of the next century, when the Delhi Sultanate invaded the Chandela kingdom. The 1195 CE Bateshvar inscription states that other feudatory kings bowed before him, and the 1201 CE Kalanjara inscription describes him as the lord of Dasharna country. These evidences suggest that Paramardi managed to recover the Chandela power after Prithviraj Chauhan returned to Delhi. = Ghurid invasion and death = According to a Kalanjara inscription, while one of Paramardi's predecessors had imprisoned the wives of the earthly rulers, Paramardi's heroics made even the divine rulers anxious about the safety of their wives. As a result, the gods let loose an army of mlechchhas (foreigners) against him, and made him face a defeat. Prithviraj Chauhan was killed at the Second Battle of Tarain against the Ghurids in 1192 CE. After defeating the Chahamanas (Chauhans) and the Gahadavalas, the Ghurid governor of Delhi planned an invasion of Chandela kingdom. A force led by Qutb al-Din Aibak, and accompanied by strong generals such as Iltutmish, besieged the Chandela fort of Kalanjara in 1202 CE. Taj-ul-Maasir, written by the Delhi chronicler Hasan Nizami, states that Parmar (Paramardi) initially offered some resistance, but then fled to the safety of the fort. Subsequently, he surrendered before ruler of Delhi, and agreed to be his vassal. He promised to pay a tribute to the Sultan, but died before he could execute this agreement. His dewan Aj Deo (Ajaya-Deva) continued to resist the ruler of Delhi after his death. The dewan was finally forced to surrender as the water reservoirs within the fort dried up during a drought. Taj-ul-Masir further states that after the Sultanate's victory, temples were converted into mosques and 50,000 men were taken as slaves. Qutb al-Din Aibak appointed Hazabbar-ud-Din Hasan Arnal as the governor of Kalanjara, and also captured Mahoba. The 16th century Muslim historian Firishta states that Paramardi was assassinated by his own minister, who disagreed with the king's decision to surrender to the Delhi forces. Firishta as well as Fakhruddin Mubarakshah state that the fall of Kalanjara happened in the Hijri year 599 (1202-1203 CE). According to Taj-ul- Masir, Kalanjara fell on 20th of Rajab, in the Hijri year 599, on Monday. However, this date corresponds to 12 April 1203 CE, which was a Friday. Based on different interpretations of the historical sources, different scholars date the fall of Kalanjara to either 1202 CE or 1203 CE. According to the Chandela inscriptions, Paramardi was succeeded by Trailokyavarman.  Administration  According to the Baghari inscription, Paramardi placed the burden of government on his prime minister Sallakshana, who was a Brahmin of Vashistha gotra. Sallakshana commissioned temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu. After his death, his son Purushottama inherited his post. The Baghari inscription also mentions one Gadadhara as Paramardi's minister of war and peace (sandhna-vigraha-sachiva). According to the Ajaygarh inscription of Bhojavarman, a Kayastha named Gangadhara was the Kancukin (chamberlain) of Paramardi. Gangadhara and his brother Jaunadhara are said to have fought at Kalanjara, possibly in the battle against the Delhi forces. Ajayapala and Madanapala, the sons of a former senapati (general) Kilhana, were two Brahmin senapatis of Paramardi. Ajayapala is also known to have been a senapati of Paramardi's grandfather Madanavarman. Muslim chronicles mention Aj Deo (Ajaya- Deva) as a dewan who continued to resist the Delhi forces after Paramardi's death. The medieval bardic tradition also mentions Alha and Udala (or Udal) as his generals. Other officers mentioned in the historical records include Mahipala and an amatya named Vatsaraja. Paramardi was a learned man, and is attributed as the author of a eulogy to Shiva, inscribed on a stone at Kalanjara. He patronized a number of scholars, including: * Vatsaraja, the author of Rupa-Kashatakam (a collection of six plays) * Gadadhara, a poet styled as Kavi-Chakravarti * Jaganika, the author of Alha-Khanda * Gunabhadra Munipa Saiddhanti, the Jain author of Dhanya-Kumara-Charita Although himself a Shaivite, Paramardi was tolerant towards Buddhists, Jains and Vaishnavites. A copper-plate inscription shows that when he granted a village to a Brahmin, he respected the rights of a Buddhist shrine located in that village. Several images of the Jain tirthankaras were set up at various places during his reign. His minister Sallakshana commissioned a Vishnu temple.

Education Relman was born in Boston, raised in Lexington, MA, and then moved to Philadelphia where he attended Germantown Friends School. He was an undergraduate at MIT and graduated in 1977. He attended medical school at the Harvard University Medical School and received an M.D. degree, magna cum laude in 1982. He did his internship, residency, and a clinical infectious diseases fellowship year at Massachusetts General Hospital. He completed his infectious diseases and microbiology research training as a postdoctoral fellow with Stanley Falkow at Stanford University. He began his independent career as a physician-scientist with a research focus in microbial pathogenesis and soon thereafter became interested in the discovery and identification of previously-unrecognized microbial pathogens. The problem of differentiating novel pathogens from normal microbiota, the diversity of the indigenous microbiota, and the relationship of the latter with human health and disease, formed the basis of his subsequent research career. Academic career Relman joined the faculty at Stanford in 1994 and has remained there since. His development of broad range small subunit rRNA gene amplification methods for revealing novel microbial pathogens led to the identification of several important previously-uncharacterized human pathogens, including the agents of bacillary angiomatosis and of Whipple's disease. He was an early pioneer in the study of the human microbiome using modern molecular methods, and published some of the first broad molecular surveys of the human oral and gut microbiota. His current research seeks to elucidate the nature and basis of diversity, assembly, stability and resilience in the human microbial ecosystem, and their relationships with health and disease. Relman became the Thomas C. and Joan M. Merigan Professor at Stanford in 2009. He has held a variety of leadership positions at Stanford: he is the co-director, along with Amy Zegart, of the Center for International Security and Cooperation, and he is a senior fellow at both the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and the Center for Innovation in Global Health. Relman serves as the Chief of Infectious Disease at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Relman has also served in a number of United States government advisory capacities, particularly on biosecurity issues.

He is sometimes called Christopher Codrington the Younger. Born about 1640 on Barbados, Codrington was the son of another Christopher Codrington and probably the grandson of Robert Codrington, a landed gentleman with an estate at Dodington, Gloucestershire.James C.

He made a small fortune there, most of which he left to his son when he died in 1656.'\\"The Codringtons\\", in Darra Goldstein et al, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets (Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 674George C. Simmons, 'Towards a Biography of Christopher Codrington the Younger', in Caribbean Studies, Volume 12 (Institute of Caribbean Studies, University of Puerto Rico., 1972), pp. 32‚Äì36 In 1663, Codrington and other men of Barbados bought the island of Saint Lucia from native chiefs there. While still in his twenties, he was appointed to the council of Barbados, and then as deputy governor, entrusted with day-to-day administration in the absence of the Governor. In that capacity, he set about building schools and hospitals, suppressing smuggling, and controlling excessive drinking. Codrington was married to a woman named Gertrude. His elder son, another Christopher, was born on Barbados in 1668,Henry Austin Dobson, Christopher Codrington, in Leslie Stephen, ed., Dictionary of National Biography and then a younger son called John, who was an \\"imbecile.\\" In 1669, Codrington was accused of murdering Henry Willoughby, a son of the Governor, Lord Willoughby, in the course of a dispute about Codrington's acquisition of a desirable estate on Barbados called Consetts. Willoughby died suddenly with a \\"violent burning of the stomach\\", a few hours after eating a meal with Codrington, and although no wrongdoing was ever proved, Codrington never entirely recovered his good name on the island.Matthew Parker, The Sugar Barons: Family, Corruption, Empire and War (Random House, 2011), pp. 163, 164 He began to trade outside the law and to move his investments away from Barbados. In 1672, while Willoughby was away on a campaign, Codrington received a report of a rich silver mine on the island of Dominica, which was still in the possession of the Island Caribs, and summoned the council of Barbados to ask it to agree that he should seize Dominica \\"before any other nation should possess the same\\". He then sent men to negotiate the purchase of the island, and a party to take possession. However, the French Governor General, the Marquis de Baas, promptly had the Englishmen removed from the island and protested that they had broken a treaty with the French of 1660. Although supported by the Council on Trade and Plantations, when Willoughby returned to Barbados Codrington was dismissed from his position and was also removed as commanding officer of a militia regiment.Philip P. Boucher, Cannibal Encounters: Europeans and Island Caribs, 1492‚Äì1763, pp. 17‚Äì18 The exact reasons for his removal are unclear, but on 12 November 1672 Lord Willoughby wrote \\"My late Deputy Coll: Codrington hath harrassed them to death wth needless improssitions.\\" After leaving the council, between 1674 and 1682 Codrington was elected several times to the Assembly of Barbados and was its Speaker in 1674, 1675, and 1678. Codrington went on to build up the largest land holdings in Antigua, including his main plantation of Betty's Hope, which he named after his daughter, and also secured a lease of the whole island of Barbuda from the Crown.Bernard Bailyn, Philip D. Morgan, eds., Strangers Within the Realm: Cultural Margins of the First British Empire (UNC Press Books, 2012), p. 329 He was appointed as captain-general of the English Leeward Islands, and in 1683 moved his base of operations to Antigua, where he was an important plantation-owner and was influential in reforms to make the island more like Barbados. By 1685, he had founded the settlement of Codrington on Barbuda and went on to build a stronghold there. During the Nine Years' War of 1688 to 1697 he led a series of armed conflicts with the French. As a captain general, Codrington found many ways to line his own pockets and was the target of allegations of corruption when he died in 1698, not long after the Peace of Ryswick. His property was inherited by his elder son, another Christopher Codrington.Will of Christopher Codrington, Captain General of His Majesty's Leeward Caribee Islands in America, 1698, at yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk, written and proved in 1698 King William III appointed this son to succeed him as captain-general and commander-in- chief of the Leeward Islands.

It was constructed in 1909 and is one of the state's earliest surviving bridges to use rigid rather than pinned connections. Moreover, it is Minnesota's only known road bridge in which some of the rigid connections are fastened with bolts rather than rivets. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 for having state-level significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated for being a rare surviving example of Minnesota's once-common camelback through truss bridges, and for its early and uniquely transitional rigid connections. Description The Waterford bridge is a single-span, eight-panel, camelback through truss. It measures long with a deck. The setting is rural, despite being just northeast of Northfield, Minnesota. The Waterford Bridge is one of the few remaining camelback through trusses in Minnesota. The others that are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Gateway Trail Iron Bridge, the Dodd Ford Bridge, and the Long Meadow Bridge. History The Waterford Bridge was constructed in 1909. It replaced a previous bridge of unknown date which had been there since at least 1896. The new bridge was designed by Dakota County engineer Charles A. Forbes and built by the Hennepin Bridge Company for $5,000. At the time most truss bridges were still being constructed with the structural members held together by pins. The builders of the Waterford Bridge opted for stronger rigid connections, even though this was not yet legally required except for state-funded projects. Unusually, though, many of these connections were made with bolts, a unique intermediate choice proceeding the transition to fully riveted bridges. In the early 1980s the bridge was threatened by erosion and local citizens raised $40,000 to effect repairs. However, in 1991 the bridge was sufficiently deteriorated that it was closed to vehicular traffic and the road rerouted over a new bridge built nearby. In 2014 the southeast abutment was rebuilt again with a grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. As of January 2014 the historic bridge carries a trail used by pedestrians, ATVs, and snowmobiles.

History Camillo Acquacotta conjectures that it was around 578 that the first epoch of the diocese of Matelica came to an end, as a result of the massive destruction of the Lombard invasions.Acquacotta, p. 43. On 8 July 1785, the diocese of Matelica was revived by Pope Pius VI, its territory was separated from that of the diocese of Fabriano, and it was united aeque principaliter with the Diocese of Fabriano to form the Diocese of Fabriano e Matelica, two dioceses joined by the fact of having one bishop. The Collegiate Church of S. Maria e S. Bartolomeo was erected into a cathedral church, and made immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy). Its Chapter was appointed to be the cathedral Chapter, consisting of an Archpriest and thirteen Canons, two of whom would fill the offices of Theologus and Penitentiary. The rights of the bishop and diocese of Camerino over the city and territory of Matelica were extinguished. The bishop of Fabriano e Matelica would be expected to live part of the year in Fabriano and part in Matelica. In a decree of the Second Vatican Council, it was recommended that dioceses be reorganized to take into account modern developments.Directoriae normae clare a Concilio impertitae de dioecesium recognitione; indicia atque elementa apta ad actionem pastoralem aestimandam ab episcopis suppeditata quibus plurium dioecesium regimen commissum est. As part of the project begun on orders from Pope John XXIII, and continued under his successors, to reduce the number of dioceses in Italy and to rationalize their borders in terms of modern population changes and shortages of clergy, the diocese of Matelica was united to the diocese of Fabriano. The change was approved by Pope John Paul II in an audience of 27 September 1986, and by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops of the Papal Curia on 30 September 1986. Its name was to be Dioecesis Fabrianensis-Mathelicensis. The seat of the diocese was to be in Fabriano. The former cathedral in Matelica was to have the honorary title of co-cathedral, and its chapter was to be the Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one episcopal curia, one seminary, one ecclesiastical tribunal; and all the clergy were to be incardinated in the diocese of Fabriano-Matelica.Acta Apostolicae Sedis An. et Vol. LXXIX (Citt√† del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1987), pp. 699-700.

The city was platted in 1855, and soon after they began to campaign for a rail line into the town. It took 23 years before the railroad arrived. The Maple River Railroad was the first to lay tracks in Sac County in 1877, but it went to Wall Lake rather than Sac City. The Sac City & Wall Lake Railroad was formed that year and the tracks were laid between the two towns in 1878. The Chicago & North Western Railroad acquired the line in 1884, and built a two-story frame depot in Sac City. The business district grew up around the depot. In 1916 the Chicago & North Western replaced the frame depot with this single story brick depot a block to the south. It was a combination depot, passenger and freight, that utilized Chicago & North Western's Number One standard plan. At one time there were eight passenger trains that stopped in Sac City. Passenger service was discontinued here in 1948. The depot was used by the railroad as a freight depot until 1971, when it was sold to You'll Plumbing. The railroad abandoned the tracks the following year. You'll sold the building in 1976, and it became The Depot Restaurant. In 2012 the restaurant closed and it now houses other retail establishments. The former depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

Design and construction Cherokee was ordered on 30 March 1807, based on a design by Henry Peake. The ship was laid down in December 1807 by John Perry at Blackwall Yard, London. As built, the ship had a burthen of 237 tons, and was long at the gun deck, and at the keel. She was wide, and drew at the bows and aft. The ship was armed with eight 18-pounder carronades, with two 6-pounder guns mounted as bow chasers, and had a complement of 75. She was launched on 24 February 1808. Service history Cherokee was commissioned on 12 April 1808 by Commander Richard Arthur to operate in the English Channel. She captured the French vessels Union and Juene Emma on 2 and 7 March 1809, respectively, with proceeds from the sale of the ships, stores and cargo being paid on board on 22 December 1809. She took part in the Walcheren Campaign of July‚ÄìDecember 1809, and was one of a long list of ships who received prize money for property captured at Walcheren and adjacent islands in the Scheldt between 30 July and 16 August 1809, which was paid as the ships arrived at various ports from 6 October 1812. On 10 January 1810 Arthur made a reconnaissance of the port of Dieppe, observing seven privateer luggers anchored close to the pier head under the protection of shore batteries. At 1 a.m he took the Cherokee into the port, running in between two of the vessels. He fought off an attempt by the French to board, and while under fire from cannon in the shore batteries, and from muskets in the other privateers, successfully brought out one. She proved to be the Amiable Nelly, of 106 tons, armed with 16 guns, and with a crew of 60. Cherokee suffered only two men slightly wounded, while two Frenchmen were killed and eight wounded, three seriously. Arthur was rewarded for this action by being promoted to post- captain. A clasp to the Naval General Service Medal, \\"Cherokee 10 Jany. 1810\\", was awarded to surviving claimants in 1847. Command of Cherokee then passed to Commander William Ramage, based at Leith to operate in the North Sea and on the coast of Norway. * On 7 January 1811 she captured the vessels Lavens Laver and Hercules. Prize money for both was paid on board on 29 August 1812. * On 1 May 1811, boats from Cherokee, and , made an attempt to cut out some galliots at Egersund, on the coast of Norway, but were thwarted by the arrival of boats from HDMS Lolland.Tops√∏e-Jensen Vol 2 page 68 * On 9 October 1811 she captured a Danish privateer cutter, armed with two guns and with a crew of twenty, three days out from Bergen. * She also captured the Zeegeluk on 27 April 1811; the Arve Brakart on 18 October 1811; and the Envold Fortuna, Maria and Bergen on 25 May 1812, with prize money for all being paid on arrival at Leith in April 1813. Ramage appears to have retained command of Cherokee after the end of the war, until on 1 January 1817 Commander Thomas Smith assumed command of her at Leith. Smith had the misfortune of having been taken prisoner by the French during the battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809, while serving as a lieutenant in the sloop Lyra, when the boat he commanded was captured. He was held as a prisoner of war until June 1814, receiving promotion to commander on his return. In November 1818, he conveyed the Archduke Maximilian of Austria- Este to Ireland in Cherokee; in gratitude the Archduke presented him with a gold snuff box. Commander Theobald Jones took command of Cherokee at Leith on 26 February 1819, and served on the South America Station in 1822. Finally, Commander William Keats (a nephew of Admiral Sir Richard Goodwin Keats) took command on 7 October 1822, and was based at Leith and Cork. Fate On 26 March 1828 the Cherokee was laying at Deptford, where she was offered for sale by the Navy Office. She was bought by J. Crystal for ¬£610.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The former Salisbury Town Hall stands in the rural village center of the town, at the southwest corner of Maple Run Road and Prospect Street. It is a -story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and marble foundation. Its front facade is distinguished by its central entrance, which is set in a deep recess taking up the central portion of the three-bay facade. The building corners have pilasters rising to a broad entablature, with a fully pedimented gable above that has an oculus window at its center. The interior of the hall is reflective of a major early 20th-century renovation, which included adding a second story. The ground floor houses what was historically office space, with an auditorium on the second floor. with The hall was built in 1869 as a single-story building. The town had decided in 1857 to build one, but was delayed in building it by the American Civil War. It underwent a major renovation in 1908, at which time the roof was raised and the second story added, and most previous interior details were lost. It underwent further work in 1948, after it was damaged by fire. In the 1970s and 1980s the building housed the public library on the ground floor, with the auditorium space on the second floor used as a gymnasium by the local school.

By then the division was composed of: *Division HQ *208th Motorized Infantry Regiment; *209th Motorized Infantry Regiment(newly activated); *210th Motorized Infantry Regiment; *275th Tank Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment(newly activated); *350th Artillery Regiment; *Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment(former 209th Regiment) In late October 1962 the division was further organized into a Mechanized Army Division, becoming the second mechanized division of PLA ground force (the first one was 1st Mechanized Division). A tank battalion is activated in each now mechanized infantry regiments. As of late 1962, the division was composed of: *Division HQ *208th Mechanized Infantry Regiment; *209th Mechanized Infantry Regiment; *210th Mechanized Infantry Regiment; *275th Tank Self- Propelled Artillery Regiment; *350th Artillery Regiment; *Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment On June 15, 1966, the division was removed from the 24th Army Corps and was transferred to the Beijing Garrison and renamed as the 3rd Guard Division(). The 208th, 209th, and 210th Mechanized Infantry Regiments were renamed as the 7th, 8th, and 9th Guard Regiments, respectively. In August 1969 the 275th Tank Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment was renamed as the Tank Regiment, 3rd Guard Division, and the 350th Artillery Regiment was renamed as the Artillery Regiment, 3rd Guard Division. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the division was the only one mechanized formation following 190th Army Division's re-motorization, and the only unit possessing tank battalions for its infantry regiments. Since December 31, 1974, the division became a \\"showcase\\" unit. In January 1979, 7th, 8th and 9th Guard Regiments were renamed as the 11th, 12th, and 13th Guard Regiments, respectively. In 1998 the 12th Guards Regiment was disbanded. The Tank Regiment was renamed as the Armored Regiment, 3rd Guard Division.  Current organization  Today, as one of only 7 active divisions of the PLA Ground Forces within Beijing and one of the few remaining divisions in service, it is organized into: *Division HQ *11th Guards Regiment (showcase unit) *13th Guards Regiment (special security unit) *Armored Regiment *Artillery Regiment *Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment *Support Battalion The division is permanently garrisoned in Beijing and thus helps provide for its defense and security as the capital of the republic.

The alternate history novel tells the story of Cora and Caesar, two slaves in the southeastern United States during the 19th century, who make a bid for freedom from their Georgia plantations by following the Underground Railroad, which the novel depicts as primarily a rail transport system in addition to a series of safe houses and secret routes. The Underground Railroad was a critical and commercial success, hitting the bestseller lists and winning several notable prizes. It won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the 2016 National Book Award for Fiction, the Arthur C. Clarke Award\\"Arthur C Clarke Winner Announced\\", Foyles, July 27, 2017., and the 2017 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence. It was longlisted for the 2017 Man Booker Prize. Plot The story is told in the third person, focusing mainly on Cora. Scattered single chapters also focus on Cora's mother Mabel, the slavecatcher Ridgeway, a reluctant slave sympathizer named Ethel, and Cora's fellow slave Caesar. Cora is a slave on a plantation in Georgia and an outcast after her mother Mabel ran off without her. She harbors a great deal of resentment towards Mabel for escaping, although readers later learn that her mother, in an attempt to return to Cora, actually died from a snake bite and never reached her. Caesar approaches Cora about a plan to flee. Reluctant at first, she eventually agrees as her situation with her master and fellow slaves worsens. During their escape, they encounter a group of slavecatchers, who capture Cora's young friend Lovey. Cora is forced to kill a teenage boy to protect herself and Caesar, eliminating any possibility of merciful treatment should she ever be recaptured. With the help of an inexperienced abolitionist, Cora and Caesar find the Underground Railroad, depicted as a literal underground train system that runs throughout the south, transporting runaways northwards. They take a train to South Carolina.In Colson Whitehead‚Äôs Latest, the Underground Railroad Is More Than a Metaphor Upon learning of their escape, Ridgeway begins a hunt for the pair, largely in revenge for Mabel, who is the only escapee he has ever failed to capture. Meanwhile, Cora and Caesar have taken up comfortable residence in South Carolina under assumed names. South Carolina is enacting a program where the government owns former slaves but employs them, provides medical treatment, and gives them communal housing. The two enjoy their time there and put off the decision to leave until Cora learns of plans to sterilize black women and use black men as test subjects in an experiment to track the spread of syphilis. Ridgeway arrives before the two can leave, and Cora is forced to return to the Railroad alone. She later learns that Caesar was killed by an angry mob after having been caught and jailed by Ridgeway. Cora eventually arrives in a closed-down station in North Carolina. She is found by Martin, the son of the station's former operator. North Carolina has recently decided to abolish slavery, using indentured servants instead, and violently executing any runaway slaves found in the state (as well as some freedmen). Martin, terrified of what the North Carolinians might do to an abolitionist, hides Cora in his attic for several months. Eventually, Cora becomes ill and is reluctantly treated by Martin's wife Ethel. While Cora is down from the attic, a raid is conducted on the house, and she is recaptured by Ridgeway, while Martin and Ethel are executed by the mob. Ridgeway takes Cora back toward Georgia, detouring through Tennessee to return another slave to his master. While stopped in Tennessee, Ridgeway's traveling party is attacked by some escaped slaves, who release Cora. Cora travels to a farm in Indiana owned by a free black man named Valentine, along with one of her rescuers, a man called Royal. The farm is populated by a number of freedmen and escapees, living and working in harmony. Royal, who is an operator on the Railroad, begins a romantic relationship with Cora, although she remains hesitant because of a rape by other slaves in her childhood. Unfortunately for the pair, a small faction of freedmen fears that their peaceful life will be ruined by the presence of escaped slaves, and tips off some slavecatchers to their presence. The farm is burned, and many people, including Royal, are killed in a raid by white Hoosiers. Ridgeway recaptures Cora and forces her to take him to a closed-down Railroad station nearby. When they arrive, she pushes him down a flight of stairs, severely injuring him. She then runs off down the tracks. Eventually, she emerges from the underground tracks to find a caravan traveling out West. She is given a ride by one of the wagons' colored drivers and the novel ends. Literary influences and parallels In the \\"Acknowledgments\\", Whitehead mentions two famous escaped slaves: \\"Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, obviously.\\" While in Jacobs's native North Carolina, Cora has to hide in an attic where, like Jacobs, she is not able to stand, but like her can observe the outside life through a hole that \\"had been carved from the inside, the work of a previous occupant\\".Colson Whitehead: The Underground Railroad. London 2017, pp. 185. Martin Ebel, who observed this parallel in a review for the Swiss Tages-Anzeiger, also observes that the \\"Freedom Trail\\", where the victims of North Carolinian lynchings hang from trees, has a historic predecessor in the crosses the Romans raised along the Appian Way to kill the slaves who had joined Spartacus' famous slave rebellion, impressively transformed into literature by Arthur Koestler in his novel The Gladiators. Ridgeway reminds Ebel of inspector Javert, the hero's merciless persecutor in Victor Hugo's Les mis√©rables.Wie Sklaven ihrem Schicksal entkamen. (in German). In The New Yorker, Kathryn Schulz likens Ridgeway to both Captain Ahab of Moby-Dick and the slave-catcher August Pullman of the TV series Underground: \\"Ridgeway ... and August Pullman, in \\"Underground,\\" are Ahab-like characters, privately and demonically obsessed with tracking down specific fugitives.\\"The Perilous Lure of the Underground Railroad Interestingly, both Ahab and Ridgeway have a soft spot for a black boy: Ahab for the cabin-boy Pip, and Ridgeway for 10-year-old Homer, whom he bought as a slave and set free the next day.Colson Whitehead: The Underground Railroad. London 2017, pp. 242-243. In Whitehead's North Carolina, all blacks have been \\"abolished\\".A white politician named Garrison says: \\"We abolished niggers.\\", Colson Whitehead: The Underground Railroad. London 2017, p. 197. Martin Ebel observes the parallel to Hitler's program of exterminating all Jews, and also the parallel between Cora's concealment and Anne Frank's. Another parallel to literature on Nazi Germany may be found in the erection of three gallows by Cora's plantation master. He had the three gallows erected for Cora and her two fellow fugitives in order to put them to a cruel death as soon as each fugitive would be returned.Colson Whitehead: The Underground Railroad. London 2017, p. 250. In Anna Seghers's novel The Seventh Cross, written in exile between 1938 and 1942, seven prisoners escape from a concentration camp, and the camp commander has a cross erected for each of them to be tortured there after his being returned. Reception =Honors= The novel has received a number of awards, including the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 2016 National Book Award for Fiction. The previous book to win both the Pulitzer and the National Book prizes was The Shipping News, by E. Annie Proulx, in 1993. While awarding the Pulitzer Prize, the committee recognized this novel for a \\"smart melding of realism and allegory that combines the violence of slavery and the drama of escape in a myth that speaks to contemporary America.\\" [https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/colson-whitehead The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead (Doubleday) ] The Underground Railroad was also awarded the Arthur C. Clarke Award for science fiction literature.Page, Benedicte, \\"Whitehead shortlisted for Arthur C Clarke Award\\", The Bookseller, May 3, 2017. When The Underground Railroad was published in the United States in August 2016, it was selected for Oprah's Book Club. On 5 August 2020, a crater on Pluto's moon Charon was named Cora, after the character in the novel, by the International Astronomical Union's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature. =Critical reception= The novel received positive reviews from critics. Reviewers praised it for its commentary on both the past and present of the United States. In 2019, The Underground Railroad was ranked 30th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. The novel was voted the greatest of its decade in Paste and was third place (along with Jennifer Egan‚Äôs A Visit from the Goon Squad) in a list by Literary Hub.

Their music, which was recorded during the Bristol sessions in 1927, had a profound impact on country and bluegrass music. The original family band included Joe Blackard (banjo, vocals), his daughter Clarice (piano, vocals), Jesse Shelor (fiddle, vocals) and Pyrhus Shelor (fiddle), and later resurfaced on an album of field recordings arranged in 1975. History Born in December 1894, Jesse Shelor began playing the fiddle at ten years-old under the tutelage of the regionally popular musician William Sprangler. Jesse's two brothers Tump and Babe were also fiddle players, and Babe appears on the compilation album The Old-Time Virginia Fiddlers. In 1917, Jesse Shelor was drafted into the armed forces during the First World War, but was discharged after most of his division was wiped out by the Spanish influenza. He renewed his music career with his mentor Sprangler and married Joe Blackard's daughter, Clarice, in 1919. Working as a mailman and playing banjo on the side, Blackard offered the songs ‚ÄúYoung Beichan‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Holy Twig‚Äù, ‚ÄúFine Sally‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBow and Balance to Me‚Äù to writer Cecil Sharp for his book English Folksongs from the Southern Mountains in 1918. Like the Shelor family, the Blackard family included several musicians including bluegrass fiddlers Delmar and Buddy Pellington. In the 1920s, Jesse and Pyrus Shelor joined Joe and Clarice Blackard to perform under the name \\"The Shelor Family\\" for dances and other social functions. While on the lookout for new artists, record producer Ralph Peer took the advice of Ernest Stoneman, and traveled to Bristol, then a crossroads for folk musicians. Although the initial response was lackluster at best, musicians soon came in droves, including the Shelor Family, to record for Peer when Stoneman revealed he was being paid $50 per side. On August 2, 1927, the group, along with Jesse and Clarice Shelor's seven-year-old son Joseph holding sheet music, recorded the songs \\"Sandy River Belle‚Äù, ‚ÄúBig Ben Gal‚Äù (incorrectly labeled Big Bend Gal), ‚ÄúBilly Grimes the Rover‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSuzanna Gal‚Äù at a millinery shop. Released under the name Dad Blackard's Moonshiners, the four sides are a part of the Bristol sessions, which had a significant impact on future waves of country and bluegrass musicians. Even though the Shelor Family was offered the opportunity to record again, the group never returned, but the family and the generations that followed continued to stay involved in music both professionally and semi- professionally. Among the most successful performers of the Shelor Family is Sammy Shelor, who leads the commercially successful bluegrass band Lonesome River Band.

The Monastery of San Girolamo in Campansi is a former convent located on Via Campansi #18 in the city of Siena, region of Tuscany, Italy. The Baroque-style church still stands as an independent chapel; while the monastery has been converted to a nursing home (Casa di Riposo) for the elderly. There is a separate Monastery of San Girolamo on via San Girolamo, located in a different contrada of Siena. History Located in the northern peninsula of medieval Siena, the monastery was located adjacent to what would be called the Porta di Campansi.This gate was sealed in 14th- century, reopened, and later in 1500. The monastery originated from a few woman aligned with the Franciscan order in the late 13th to early 14th century. They obtained from the republic the donation of houses in this district, known for its abundance of prostitutes. However, only in 1420-1430 was a monastery building erected, and in 1473 the nuns obtained permission from Pope Sixtus IV to erect an oratory at the site. In 1575, the convent housed some 77 women seeking vocation. Only in 1613 did the monastery receive official recognition by Cardinal Metello Bichi. It soon became popular among the aristocratic classes to accommodate their women to the cloistered life. For example, Berenice, daughter of Agostino Chigi, took on the vows of a Poor Clares in 1683. The great-grandsons of Pope Alexander VII endowed the decoration of the structures. Construction of the church began in 1683; the facade consists of three ground floor arches. The church was built perpendicular to the former oratory.Il Cittadino Online, articles as part of Cronache dal Medioevo, dated 19 March 2014. The convent was suppressed in 1808 during the Napoleonic occupation, but re-opened in 1816, only to undergo a final suppression in 1874. The property was ceded to a charitable communal office of the Ricovero di Mendicita (Recovery from Poverty). In 1889, it became an asylum for abandoned elders. The convent underwent numerous modifications over the last two centuries. Artworks The church contains a fresco attributed to the studio of Sano di Pietro (1460‚Äì70). The ceiling of the church has frescoes depicting the Glory of St Peter of Alcantara with the Virgin, St Francis, and Christ attributed to a Giulio Coralli and Niccol√≤ Ricciolini.

They credited Boswell with providing \\"a revolutionary interpretation of the Western tradition\\", but noted that his premise that \\"a gay identity and gay people can be found throughout history\\" had been challenged as \\"essentialist\\" by social constructionists. The political scientist Sheila Jeffreys argued that while Boswell covered material that \\"should provide fascinating insights into gender, power, and sexuality\\" he \\"avoids any such insights scrupulously.\\" She criticized him for confusing \\"the abuse of slave children in prostitution\\" with \\"eroticism\\" and concluded that like other gay theorists he was guilty of \\"moral and political myopia.\\" The philologist Warren Johansson, the art historian Wayne R. Dynes and John Lauritsen criticized Boswell's thesis. They argued that Boswell had attempted to whitewash the historic crimes of the Christian Church against gay men.

He ruled the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). Chandela inscriptions suggest that Trailokyavarman succeeded Paramardi as the Chandela ruler. He was probably Paramardi's son, although this cannot be said with certainty based on the available evidence. Seven inscriptions of Trailokyavarman have been found at Ajaygarh, Banpur, Garra near Chhatarpur, and Tehri (Tikamgarh). A number of other places in the Bundelkhand region are mentioned in these inscriptions. The inscriptions give him the usual imperial titles Parama-bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara Parama-Maheshvara Shri-Kalanjaradhipati. His coins have been found in Banda district. This indicates that he controlled a large part of the traditional Chandela dominions. Trailokyavarman bore the title Kalanjaradhipati (\\"Lord of Kalanjara\\"), which suggests that he recovered the Kalanjara fort from the Turkic rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. The Garra copper-plate inscription of Trailokyavarman as well as the Ajaygarh inscription of his successor Viravarman support this hypothesis. The Garra inscription records the grant of a village to the son of Rauta Pape, who was killed in a battle with the Turushkas (Turkic people). The Ajaygarh inscription states that like Vishnu, he lifted the earth submerged in the ocean formed by the Turushkas. The Muslim chronicle Tabaqat-i Nasiri also suggests that Kalanjara had slipped from the Delhi Sultanate control, before it was raided by Iltutmish's officer Malik Nusrat-ud-din Taisi (or Tayasi) in 1233 CE. According to the text, Taisi marched to Kalanjara from Gwalior, forcing the ruler of Kalanjara to flee, and then plundered the city. According to the Ajaygarh rock inscription from Bhojavarman's reign, Trailokyavarman's general Ananda subjugated several tribes, including the Bhillas, the Shabaras and the Pulindas. He is also said to have defeated Bhojuka, whose identity is uncertain. Some earlier scholars believed that Trailokyavarman captured the northern portion of the Kalachuri kingdom as well as Kanyakubja. This theory was based on the identification of \\"Trailokyamalla\\" mentioned in the 1212 CE Dhureti inscription with Trailokyavarman. However, the discovery of the 1197 CE Jhulpur inscription nullifies this assumption: Trailokyamalla was actually a son of Kalachuri king Vijayasimha. Like his predecessors, Trailokyavarman issued gold coins featuring a seated goddess, and copper coins featuring the deity Hanuman. He was succeeded by Viravarman.

He bore the usual Chandela imperial titles Parama-bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara Kalanjaradhipati. Like his predecessors, Viravarman issued copper coins and gold coins featuring a seated goddess. According to the 1311 VS Charkhari inscription, Viravarman's general Rauta Abhi defeated Dabhyuhada-Varman of Chandreshvar-anvaya at Sondhi (modern Seondha). Viravarman also invaded Nalapura (modern Narwar), the capital of the Yajvapala ruler Gopala. The Dahi copper-plate inscription of the Chandelas claims that the Chandela general Mallaya defeated the lord of Nalapura. On the other hand, the Bangla and Narwar inscriptions of the Yajvapalas claim that Gopala defeated Viravarman. It is possible that Viravarman achieved some initial successes, but was forced to retreat. According to the Muslim historians such as Firishta, the Delhi Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud subjugated the Bundelkhand area around 1251 CE. However, he could not completely eliminate the Chandelas, as evident by the Chandela inscriptions dated after this period. A 1260 CE inscription of Viravarman's queen Kalyanadevi records the construction of a well and a tank at Nandipura. According to a Kalanjara inscription, Viravarman commissioned several temples, gardens and water bodies. He also installed images of the deities such as Shiva, Kamala and Kali. An Ajaygarh inscription records the installation of a Jain image during his reign. Viravarman was succeeded by Bhojavarman.

It was released worldwide in January 2016 for Windows and Mac OS X through the download service Steam, as well as for PlayStation 4, and later in April 2020 for the Nintendo Switch. The game follows a team of astronauts on the first manned mission to Mars, in order to track down a signal that is apparently extraterrestrial in origin. After being hit by a micrometeorite storm, they must resort to desperate measures to survive the trip. A turn- based game played using simulated virtual dice, the player controls four characters, attempting to fix problems with the ship and keep the crew alive each turn by managing their dice cache, health, and stress level. Developed by designer Zach Gage and the indie development studio Choice Provisions, the game was created to mimic a board game experience. Critics were polarized on whether the gameplay was deeply strategic or overly dependent on random chance, and the game was more poorly received by video game reviewers than streamers, board game players or other developers.  Gameplay  Tharsis allows players to control four astronauts with unique jobs and abilities inside a heavily damaged spacecraft, the Iktomi. The game lasts for 10 in-game weeks, during which time the player must attempt to reach Mars without any of the crew perishing. At the start of each week, at least two parts of the ship will have a problem in need of repair, and which, if left alone, can damage the ship's hull integrity or crewmember health. The player can click each astronaut to deploy them to a certain module for that turn and repair them using the astronaut's dice. If a problem is not repaired after all crew members move, the negative effect will trigger.alt=Gameplay screenshot from TharsisEach astronaut has their own health points (HP), stress meter, and dice cache. Every roll of the dice decreases the character's maximum dice by one unless replenished with food. Problems can only be repaired by adding enough dice to match the indicated number. However, there are several types of hazards that can hinder dice rolls, which can only be avoided by gaining \\"assists\\". There are a maximum of three assists at a time, and one is consumed to prevent a hazard. Besides using the dice to repair, each room has a bonus that can be activated by rolling a certain dice, or combination of them. Extra dice can also be invested into research, allowing beneficial abilities to be used at a later time. At the end of each week, crew can work on side projects that the player can choose from. Usually, these side projects have both a positive and negative effect. The higher the crew's stress, the worse the negative effects, and if crew are allowed to go insane, they will work on a solo side project with a more drastic effect than usual, and may harm the other crew. The crew can also eat food, if any, during this time. Cannibalism can be used as a last resort if the crew runs out of food. The player can choose to feed the body of a crew member who died in the beginning of the game to various surviving crew. However, this has significant negative consequences to the characters' stress levels and maximum health, and affects the game's ending.  Plot  The game is set in the near future, where Earth has received a mysterious signal from Tharsis on Mars. With scientists believing it to be a sign of extraterrestrial life, the Iktomi is built, and its six crewmembers are sent to Mars to investigate the anomaly. Depending on the characters used, the voice of the commander will be either male or female. However, halfway through their mission, the ship is suddenly hit by a micrometeorite storm that kills two crew members, Mapiya Musgrave and J. Cross, and destroys the Pantry where the food is stored. With limited food supplies and crew, disasters start running rampant throughout the ship, and the astronauts are forced to constantly fight to survive. Despite still being able to contact Mission Control, they are unable to turn back home. During the journey, the crew deciphers data sent from Tharsis and realizes that it shows what seems to be an exact copy of the crew of the Iktomi who are in dire straits. Unsure of what to make of this data, they manage to survive until they reach Mars and launch the capsule, while the Iktomi remains in orbit and is destroyed. The crew tracks down the signal and comes across an alien artifact. Suddenly, the artifact flashes with a bright light. If one or more of the Iktomi's crew is dead, the artifact's energy release seemingly kills everyone. One of the crew manages to survive long enough to send a distress call, which the artifact sends back in time, creating a causal loop. However, if all of the crew survive, then one of the crew members manages to pick up a rock and throw it at the artifact, destroying it in a massive explosion, with their ultimate fate unknown and Mars now covered in a layer of snow, implying the planet can now support human life.  Development  alt=Rainbow-colored toy xylophone According to an interview with Mike Roush, co-founder of Choice Provisions, the original inspiration for Tharsis was the story of the whaling ship Essex, which was sunk by a whale, forcing the crew to resort to desperate attempts to stay alive, including cannibalism. The game was also inspired by the Apollo 13 mission and the fact that they were forced to use unusual household items to maintain the air scrubber. The game was also created out of Choice Provisions's desire not to be \\"typecast\\" as a studio that only developed the Bit.Trip series or worked in an 8-bit retro style. Tharsis's art style was based on 70's sci-fi designs such as those used in Space: 1999 and UFO, but which was updated to be realistic in a modern-day context. The pastel color scheme was derived from that of a children's xylophone. The soundtrack consists of tracks from the album Half Age EP by Weval. The dice mechanic was used due to a perceived resurgence in the popularity of board games, as well as due to the uniqueness of the concept in video games. A challenge that was noted was the high learning curve of the game, which caused people to abandon it instead of watching the tutorial or delving deeper into the strategic mechanics. The game was balanced to provide a degree of challenge such that players could not beat the game on their first try, but required repeated attempts to be able to get further and further. The game's development took approximately two years to complete.  Reception  Since its release on Steam, Tharsis has received mixed reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Amongst positive reviews, Matt Peckham of Time called the game \\"ingenious\\" and \\"brutally exacting\\". Reviewer Andrei Dumitrescu of Softpedia cited \\"interesting mechanics\\" and \\"a lot of replayability\\", despite the high difficulty, and that the game showed how humans persevere in the face of hopeless odds. Brian Dumlao of Worthplaying scored the game moderately, praising the \\"lovingly rendered\\" graphics of the ship despite the \\"generic\\" characters, and saying the music was \\"done very well\\", though mentioning that the game was \\"not for everyone\\", and that people who weren't comfortable with losing far more often than they would win would be unhappy with the game. A common point of criticism was that success was perceived to be overly based on random chance. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid praised the game's graphics as \\"wonderful\\", aside from the faces of the crew members, but criticized the game for relying \\"too much on dice rolls\\", leading to the feeling that winning is too dependent on luck and \\"destroy[ing] one's interest in trying again\\". Rob Zacny of IGN stated that he felt that he had gotten \\"lucky\\" when things went well, instead of doing \\"something clever\\". Tyler Wilde of PC Gamer called the game it highly \\"dependent on chance\\", and suggested that the difficulty varies widely depending on how good your dice rolls are for that particular playthrough. According to designer Zach Gage, the game was one of the most critically divisive he ever worked on. The game received an overall negative response from publications that were video game focused, while it received a more positive response from streamers, board game players, and developers. He believes this is due to the fact that games of chance are usually used as a lazy shortcut to make things harder, or to take the player's money in mobile games, which caused the gameplay of Tharsis to be overlooked.

The organization was established in 1985 following a workshop held by the Joint Action Group. The group works on a local and national level to empower women and bring about social policy change.  Mission  AWAM aims to create a society where all persons, particularly women, are treated equally. This includes advocating for policy changes to ensure women's rights and gender equality. Empowering women, facilitating social transformations, and supporting women facing crisis situations are other objectives of the organization.  History  The All Women's Action Society was founded after the Joint Action Group held a two-day exhibition. This was a historic event that publicized the struggles women faced that were not talked about in the mainstream media. The members of AWAM have prided themselves on calling attention to, and providing a voice for victims of gender-based violence. One of the more groundbreaking achievements the organization has reached was the Domestic Violence Act of 1994. The act of 1994 made it illegal and punishable by law to commit violence against a victim regardless of relation or age. The All Women's Action Society also does outreach work to provide training courses in areas of gender inequality and violence. In addition, they help provide counseling services to victims of gender-based abuse. The organization founded a crisis line in 1997 under the name of Telenita. Since the founding of the organization, the mission took a more holistic approach. AWAM now also advocates for women to not only be free from gendered violence, but to be aware and awarded their rights. The society felt it was important to address all concerns and challenges women face in order to operate as a feminist organization. This shift prompted the organization to revisit its values as an institution. In 2009, members of the group created a set of core values that they would uphold in daily operations and the long term mission. Justice, equality, compassion and respect, collectivism, courage, and integrity were deemed all key values for the organization.  Structure  AWAM works on the local and national level. The organization has a small staff that coordinates the projects. There is a focus on collectivism and open participation. Within the organization there is a Working Collective which holds monthly meetings to assess the direction AWAM is heading. The executive committee for All Women's Action Society is chosen through an election process that takes place every other year. The elected members have a two-year period of service before they are reelected. The organization also contains five different functioning portfolios: Advocacy and Networking, Information and Communications, Organisational Development, Public Education and Training, and Services. These are run by the staff and function to provide support and carry out operational goals and tasks.  Campaigns  = Past = A couple years after the organization was founded the organization participated in demonstrations and worked to raise awareness of rape after a nine-year-old girl, Ang May Hong, was assaulted. An action initiative titled Citizens Against Rape (CAR) was launched in response. In 1989, the organization fought for political action against violence on women. The organization prepared a campaign kits for gendered violence and supported candidates in their campaigns. The advocacy proved by AWAM benefited candidates in gaining momentum on gendered topics. Later that year a workshop was held to work on drafting a Domestic Violence Act which was eventually passed in 1994. AWAM revived the spirit of CAR in 2003 in response to the rape and murder of Canny Ong. The goal was to bring about a local and collective movement by Malaysians to stop the incidences of rape. = Present = In June 2013, AWAM launched another ongoing nationwide campaign against domestic violence. In this launch of the campaign the organization brought important service providers into the movement. They included hospitals, police, and the welfare department. This measure was done to ensure during the education of the campaign they would be able to provide resources to those affected. In December 2013, on Human Rights Day, AWAM released a video titled Domestic Violence Hurts Families. The video shows the harm family violence can bring, and how the community is and can be involved. Since AWAM shifted their focus to a more holistic approach they often advocated for community involvement and also for rights unrelated to gendered violence. They continuously call the government to address larger issues such as foreign workers rights such as maids.  Training  The AWAM facilitates training sessions for gender sensitization, sexual harassment, rape awareness, leadership, and political participation. They train a variety of workers in various institutions such as banks, colleges, hospitals, and churches. The training sessions can be requested by any organization and they offer customized sessions.

Gold nanoparticles have been used in the past in pharmaceutical and medical uses, but it is only recently that cosmetic brands are seeking patents for gold nanoparticles to use them for cosmetic formulation. According to ongoing cancer studies, the use of gold nanoparticles can be an effective method to destroy malignant cells in the body though thanks to 3 treatments : * AuNPs as a way to deliver medecine inside the body. This allows a precise delivery of the medecine without causing an unwanted reaction from the body. * AuNPs as a way to kill cancer cells when combined with photodynamic therapy. This allows the use of light to create a reaction in the gold that will create a chemical reaction killing the cancer cell. * AuNPs as a way to kill cancer cells when combined with photothermal therapy. This allows the use of light to create a reaction in the gold that will increase the temperature of the AuNPs that kills the cancer cell. A research conducted by Tatsiana Mironava, PhD, from Stony Brook University claims that the size, concentration and frequency of application plays a major part in determining if the material is toxic. Research studies are being conducted to find out the benefits of using gold nanoparticles in cosmetic products and creams. Some of the products that claim to use gold in the formulation would include the L'Core Paris 24k Collection. The recent studies have concluded that gold is inert, and completely safe for internal medicine, but there is still an ongoing research as to the effects of gold when applied on other purposes in the body. Gold in skin care products Gold is now considered as a go to ingredient in skin care products. It is now flaked, liquified and added in moisturizers, sunscreens, eye creams and lip balms. Spa centers also use gold facials, and these are priced around $100 to $1,000. Cosmetic makers cite the use of gold in medicine, it is given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A professor and cancer researcher named Debabrata Mukhopadhya at the Mayo Clinic stated that while gold nano particles show promise for skin care they are still toxic when injected in high doses in mice. A lot of Dermathologyst even go up to say this about gold in skin care :\\"At best, they do nothing, and at worst, they can give you irritation of the skin\\" Brands using Nanocosmetics Using different surveys, it was found that almost all the major cosmetic manufacturers are already using nanotechnology in their products. Cosmetics Estee Lauder and L'Core Paris have entered the Nanomarket, with a range of products that make use of \\"Nanoparticles\\". Nano silver and Nanogold are harnessed for their antibacterial properties and used in cosmetic products.

Alden does not have a developed public access along the shoreline but can be accessed by canoe through the Cloquet River. The primary fish management species is walleye, with secondary management for largemouth bass and smallmouth bass. History =Early Logging Operations= By the 1890s, lumbermen, including Frederick Weyerhaeuser, had begun timbering the vast pine forests north of Lake Superior. Initially, the massive pine logs were floated down the entire length of the often frozen and perilous Cloquet River to the City of Cloquet, Minnesota via the Saint Louis River. This means of transporting the timber was obviously less than ideal, and in 1901, M. Joseph Scanlon and Lester Brooks formed the Brooks-Scanlon Lumber Company and planned to improve the transport of the large timber stands they controlled along the Cloquet River by building a sorting works and rail operation at Alden Lake.King, Frank A. Minnesota Logging Railroads. The University of Minnesota Press, 2003, pp. 83-87 =Construction of Railway and Sorting Works= Alden Lake Hoist c. 1906 Cloquet lumbermen under Weyerhaeuser's direction objected to this plan, however, claiming that the Alden Lake sorting works would interfere with the floating of their logs beyond it to Cloquet. Brooks-Scanlon argued that the additional expense and extended delivery time of water transport made rail shipment imperative. In condemnation proceedings brought in 1904, the courts agreed, and Brooks-Scanlon proceeded with their plans. In partnership with the Minnesota and North Wisconsin Railroad (1898-1912), a main rail line was constructed from Brooks-Scanlon's mill in Scanlon, Minnesota to Carolon, 44.5 miles to the northeast. In 1904, a 3.5-mile branch of this line was built from Alden Junction to Alden Lake, to which logs were floated from upstream. At Alden Lake, a logging dam was constructed and a hoist was erected to load logs onto rail cars. At the peak of its operation, Brooks-Scanlon employed approximately 1500 men and harvested a record-breaking amount of board feet of pine.State Drainage Commission Report of the Water Resources Investigation of Minnesota 1911-1912, 1912, pp. 517. This report, which was published in 1912, references an Alden Lake logging dam, which thereby indicates that the dam was constructed to support the log sorting/hoisting operations constructed around 1904. Over a century later, many pine logs from the sorting operation rest on the lake bottom or remain partially submerged. =Dismantling of Railway= Most of the timber was removed by 1909, and the mill in Scanlon was dismantled the year after. Between 1909 and 1912, the Minnesota and North Wisconsin Railroad was operated by Weyerhaeuser's Johnson-Wentworth Lumber Company for movement of logs to its mill in Cloquet. In 1911, 19.6 miles of line east of Alden Junction was abandoned, leaving only the 34.5 miles of main line to Scanlon. At that time, there were only three locomotives, 16 cars and one caboose left in operation. In 1912, the Minnesota and North Wisconsin was abandoned altogether.

Gameplay  Generic map of a MOBA-genre game. Yellow lines are the \\"lanes\\" where action is focused; blue and red dots are the defensive \\"towers/turrets\\" that defend them; light-colored quarter circles are the teams' bases; and blue and red corners are the structures whose destruction claims victory. MXM was a MOBA with third-person shooter characteristics. Each player controlled two playable characters known as \\"Masters\\". There were 30 Masters . Each had unique abilities and different styles of play. The Masters were characters from previous NCsoft-published games, as well as new characters. The player could switch between two Masters throughout the game, where the unused Master could regenerate its health. There was a cooldown associated with switching, as well as death. The player in MXM used the WASD keys and computer mouse to move and point the character, though the game provided the option for the player to move the character solely with the mouse. Switching the Masters used the mouse wheel. Each Master had four special abilities, with one ability a more-powerful move, and each of these abilities had a cooldown. Also uncharacteristically, the game allowed player characters to jump and dodge enemy attacks. Using the mouse to aim, many of the game's abilities were based on projectiles and skill shots. NCsoft planned to restrict gameplay on the large maps to the genre-standard two teams of five players, while smaller teams would have smaller maps, which would force player interaction. Both large and small maps will have three lanes with which to attack the opposing team's base. It was played in matches between two teams who each occupy their own base on the map. The game had a science fiction setting. The game provided player versus environment (PvE) missions, uncharacteristic to the genre, as well as the characteristic player versus player (PvP) game mode. There were other game modes: team deathmatch, point control, AOS, and arena. The PvE mode was co-operative, meaning it allowed up to four players an action role-playing game experience: The player and his/her group selected characters to play through a number of stages against computer- controlled enemies, ending each stage with a battle against a level boss. In this mode, the character progression was permanent. In the \\"Titan\\" mode of gameplay, which was a variant of point control, completing an objective would allow a team to summon a temporary super-creature called a Titan to their side to attack the enemy base. GameZone originally reported that the objective was defeating multiple enemies, while IGN reported that capturing and holding control points would cause the Titan to spawn. To end a game in this mode, the team must either have the most points at the end of the timed match, or must reach a point threshold.  Development  NCsoft was beta testing the game in South Korea in October 2014, and was NCsoft's first internally-developed MOBA. Engadget did not know of a release or localization date at that time, but also reported a month later that NCsoft planned to release a mobile version of the game. In mid-2015, NCsoft planned to release the game in a beta version globally in early 2016, with a later full-release of the game the same year. The game was still in beta test only in South Korea. In January 2016, NCsoft announced the launch of the game for personal computer in the second half of 2016 for Europe and North America. NCsoft did not announce a pay model. In June 2016, NCsoft provided free game keys for a brief alpha playtest on personal computer, which focused on PvP interactions and some PvE content. Both Polygon and VideoGamer cooperated with NCsoft to provide keys to their readers. The game was developed for cloud technology. The game's design philosophy was based on team work. NCsoft said that the reason for the \\"long\\" deaths was to ensure players keep their teams in mind. The PvE in the game was designed to teach players their heroes. The matches were designed to last approximately ten minutes. The game was free-to-play.  Reception  = Pre- release = GameZone was overall \\"impressed\\". IGN thought there was a lot of potential. The game was compared to Heroes of the Storm, Smite, Diablo, Van Helsing, and Torchlight. IGN also commented on the crowd of MOBAs with which MXM would need to compete, noting that \\"standing out\\" would likely be challenging. Engadget suggested \\"it might be different enough from its contemporaries to pique your interest\\", while IGN thought the publisher's experience with world-building helped to differentiate the gameplay modes. GameZone praised the aesthetics, saying that the palette adds to the game's setting. He also praised the level design. IGN thought some of the characters were generic, but was impressed with the detail of the character design, and was expectant for future releases. IGN called the action \\"over the top\\" and said the gameplay was designed for action players. GameZone was surprised at the length of the time the player needed to wait before respawning. GameZone called the two-Master aspect the most unique aspect of the game, while IGN called it \\"an inventive system that adds a whole new layer of strategy to battle\\". Previewers at both GameZone and IGN thought the swapping difficult at-first but quickly adjusted. IGN wasn't sure how veterans of the genre would react to it. GameZone thought the game provided a good learning curve. IGN called the control scheme easy to use, \\"unorthodox\\", and \\"unique\\", which \\"gave the combat more of an arcade feel\\". The IGN previewer \\"felt like he had more opportunities to cut loose, rather than staing focused and determined at all times in other titles\\" due to the controls. GameZone thought the game was \\"easier to grasp than other \\". IGN thought the most interesting aspect was the player versus environment mode, which is fully fleshed out. The previewer thought this was refreshing since other genre titles overlook the character and plot. IGN called the Titan game mode \\"a cool take on faction battles\\", which \\"offered the most intense and pure gameplay in MXM\\".  Closure  In November 2017, NCsoft decided to close the game on January 31, 2018.

Career In 1667, at the age of 28, he was sent out by the Court of Directors of the East India Company to Fort St. George to assist in reinstating the imprisoned Governor, George Foxcroft. However, partly due to illness on his way overland from Surat, Clavell did not reach his destination until January 1669 when he found that the dispute between Foxcroft and Sir Edward Winter had already been resolved. He petitioned to go to the Bay of Bengal where he was appointed second in command, and, when Shem Bridges left for England, became acting 'Chief of the factories in the Bay of Bengal' a post in which he was confirmed by orders from the EIC in December 1672. In June 1672, Clavell procured a parwana (firman) from Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal, which did little to stop the oppression of British trade by Khan and Malik Quasim, the Governor of Hooghly. From 1672 to 1676 Clavell quarrelled with Joseph Hall, factor at Cossimbazar, who he accused of trading on his own account against the EIC's interests amongst a host of other charges. Counter charges were made against Clavell including expropriation of property and the construction of \\"a Pallace\\" at Balasore. Major William Puckle of the EIC was sent to investigate and concluded that Clavell was guilty of \\"overrateing the Companys Goods 40 per Cent. great private Tradeing, &c; and keeping the Generall Books himself contrary to the Companys Order.\\" In 1676 Clavell returned to Hooghly with Streynsham Master, recently appointed superintendent of the factories and at the latter's request wrote an Accompt of the Trade of Hughly and Ballasore. On 4August 1677, Clavell died of fever with his wife and infant child following the next day. Personal life Clavell first married Prudence Lance, by whom he had one son, William, 1673-1680. She was the \\"affianced wife\\" of Walter Clavell and travelled out to India at the Hon. East India's expense. She died after her son was born. She died in 1673 in West Bengal, She was a \\"kinswoman\\" of Sir Matthew Holworthy, a wealthy City of London merchant. He left ¬£1,000 to Harvard College. See: Wikipedia/Holworthy Hall/p His second wife, Martha Woodroffe, 1650-1677 was the sister of the wife of Sir Edward Littleton by whom he had two sons. His second son, also Walter, was baptized in Cossimbazar on 29September 1678. In 1681 Walter junior and his brother Edward left India for England aboard the East Indiaman President.

He wrote, \\"director Ben Smallbone (brother of the movie's lead player) is adept at generating suspense, particularly during a scene in which James attempts a phone conversation with his daughter while bad guys lurk outside his motel room, and manages to persuasively convey the seediness, desperation, and danger that define the demimonde that Garo rules with a whim of iron. To put it another way: Priceless achieves greater impact through understatement and implication than many other similarly plotted movies do with R-rated explicitness.\\"Film Review: ‚ÄòPriceless‚Äô (Variety) Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com was negative about the film, criticizing it as \\"cheap and generic.\\" She wrote, \\"The main intention behind 'Priceless,' besides allowing For King & Country to become involved in the movie business, seems to be a genuine desire to raise awareness of the horrors of the crime of trafficking, not that this PG-13 drama shows anything too graphic. But, on a purely entertainment level, all I know is when the end credits started rolling, I said to myself, 'Thank God.'\\" Kimber Myers of the Los Angeles Times was more positive, characterizing it as a \\"lean drama that relies more on emotion than well-crafted dialogue or character development\\" and saying, \\"Though its obvious message may not translate well outside its intended audience, the converted will likely be entertained by the well-produced package the moving themes are delivered in.\\" Accompanying media For King and Country recorded Priceless, a song which serves on the film's soundtrack.

The present day route was officially opened on September 1, 2012, as part of a revision of the network map.  History  = Historic route (-1953) = The first tram route 9 originally operated a route between the Van Schoonbekeplein, near the Eilandje neighborhood, and Antwerpen Berchem station, using a trajectory via Meirbrug, the Stadspark and Dageraadplaats. In 1953 however, tram tracks were broken up, and the route was replaced by bus route 9, following the same itinerary. Later, bus route 9 was extended from Berchem station to the Fruithoflaan, also in Berchem. After the opening of the new tram route, the operation of bus route 9 was suspended. The trajectory between Berchem station and the Fruithoflaan was transferred to the newly created bus routes 90, 91 and 92, which subsequently continue there itinerary to Mortsel and either Lier, Waarloos or Kontich. In 2014, the trajectory of these lines was slightly modified to better service the Fruithoflaan, resuming the old route of bus line 9 in the street, which had previously not been the case. = Present day route (2012-) = Zurenborg tram stop On September 1, 2012, the new tram route 9 was officially opened on the Linkeroever-Eksterlaar trajectory as a part of a large scale redrawing of the Antwerp public transport network. The new route replaced tram route 11 on the Eksterlaar-Berchem station trajectory, as this route had been shortened to the latter, and introduced a new premetro connection between Berchem and Linkeroever. Between Berchem station and Plantin premetro station, the route uses a part of the tram network and a premetro entrance that had previously only been in use for trams running between their depot and destined lines, although it had already been used temporarily in 1988 by route 8 and in the 1990s by route 11 due to construction works on their original trajectories. On this trajectory was, along with the opening of route 9, also built a new tram stop named Zurenborg, being located in the famous Art Nouveau Zurenborg neighborhood. This stop is currently the only one in the entire Antwerp tram network making use of an island platform. Because trams in Antwerp do in general only have doors on the right side of the vehicle, the trams on route 9 are required to drive on the left side of the road when halting at the stop. A second stop named Cuperus is also planned on the Plantin-Berchem station trajectory, but has not yet been built.  Colour  Trams on route 9 use combination of white text, depicting the number 9 and the destination, and an orange background.  Rolling Stock  Most trams on route 9 are of the more modern HermeLijn type. However, older coupled PCC cars can still sporadically been seen on the route.
