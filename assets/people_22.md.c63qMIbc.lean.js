Almost all IC manufacturers active during this initial era fabricated models for this series. It is still in use today. History DIP-16), manufactured by RCA The 4000 series was introduced as the CD4000 COS/MOS series in 1968 by RCA as a lower power and more versatile alternative to the 7400 series of transistor- transistor logic (TTL) chips. The logic functions were implemented with the newly introduced Complementary Metal‚ÄìOxide‚ÄìSemiconductor (CMOS) technology. While initially marketed with \\"COS/MOS\\" labeling by RCA (which stood for Complementary Symmetry Metal-Oxide Semiconductor), the shorter CMOS terminology emerged as the industry preference to refer to the technology. The first chips in the series were designed by a group led by Albert Medwin. Wide adoption was initially hindered by the comparatively lower speeds of the designs compared to TTL based designs. Speed limitations were eventually overcome with newer fabrication methods, leaving the older TTL chips to be phased out. The series was extended in the late 1970s and 1980s with new models that were given 45xx and 45xxx designations, but are usually still regarded by engineers as part of the 4000 series. In the 1990s, some manufacturers (e.g. Texas Instruments) ported the 4000 series to newer HCMOS based designs to provide greater speeds. Design considerations The 4000 series facilitates simpler circuit design through relatively low power consumption, a wide range of supply voltages, and vastly increased load- driving capability (fanout). This makes the series ideal for use in prototyping LSI designs. While TTL based design is similarly modular, it requires meticulous planning of a circuit's electrical load characteristics.

She served as deputy leader (and briefly leader) of the Alliance party and was later High Commissioner to Niue.  Early life  Lee was born in Wellington, and grew up in a two bedroom MƒÅori Affairs house with her parents, grandfather and great grandfather. She was educated at Onslow College. Lee later moved to Auckland, settling on Waiheke Island. Her involvement in politics began with the foundation of Mana Motuhake, a MƒÅori issues party, in 1979. Her political career, however, did not begin until 1983, with her election to the Waiheke County Council. She became chairperson of the Council in 1989. When Waiheke was amalgamated into Auckland proper, Lee became a member of the Auckland City Council. Lee connects to Poutini NgƒÅi Tahu, NgƒÅti Kahungunu and NgƒÅti Toa.  Member of Parliament  In 1991, Lee became president of Mana Motuhake. Shortly after this, Mana Motuhake agreed to become a founding member of the Alliance, a coalition of minor parties. In the 1993 election, Lee became the first MƒÅori woman to win a general seat (James Carroll being the first in 1893) when she successfully contested the electorate as an Alliance candidate, defeating the incumbent Richard Prebble. Upon the retirement of Mana Motuhake founder Matiu Rata in 1994, Lee became Mana Motuhake's political leader. In November 1994, when Jim Anderton stepped down as leader of the Alliance for personal reasons, Lee took his place but Lee persuaded Anderton returned to the leadership in May 1995. Lee lost her Auckland Central seat to Labour's Judith Tizard at the 1996 election. She lost the position as Mana Motuhake leader in 2001, after a leadership challenge by Willie Jackson. Lee believed that personal matters pertaining to her, such as her relationship with Te Puni K≈çkiri staffer Anaru Vercoe, was used to discredit her as leader of Mana Motuhake. Lee stayed on as the deputy leader of the Alliance until 2002 before announcing her retirement. = Cabinet member = When a Labour-Alliance coalition government was formed after the 1999 election, Lee became Minister of Local Government, Minister of Conservation, and Associate Minister of MƒÅori Affairs. She was ranked seventh in Cabinet. During her time as Minister of Conservation Lee was known as an outspoken opponent of commercial whaling. As Minister of Local Government, Lee oversaw significant reform including the development and passage of the Local Electoral Act 2001, and the development and introduction of the Local Government Act 2002 and Local Government (Rating) Act 2002. = Retirement = In 2002, the Alliance began to split between a strongly left-wing faction (led by Matt McCarten and Laila Harr√©) and a more moderate faction (led by Anderton), Lee generally backed Anderton, but eventually decided to retire from politics. In the 2002 election, she did not stand for either the Alliance (now led by McCarten and Harr√©) or Anderton's new Progressive Coalition. Lee- Vercoe has continued to be politically active by being a guest commentator on issues affecting MƒÅori and New Zealand on Te Karere, Breakfast, Native Affairs and Radio Waatea. Her career as a parliamentarian was honoured and highlighted in the Matangireia documentary series, released in 2019, that documented former MƒÅori politicians and their legacy.  Diplomat  Lee was High Commissioner to Niue, representing the New Zealand and UK governments, from 12 February 2003 to 3 October 2005.

These soldiers would conquer and defend the territories of the Roman Empire during the late Republic and Principate eras, alongside auxiliary and cavalry detachments. At its height, Roman legionaries were viewed as the foremost fighting force in the Roman world, with commentators such as Vegetius praising their fighting effectiveness centuries after the classical Roman legionary disappeared. Roman legionaries were recruited from Roman citizens under age 45. They were first predominantly made up of recruits from Roman Italy, but more were recruited from the provinces as time went on. As legionaries moved into newly conquered provinces, they helped Romanize the native population and helped integrate the disparate regions of the Roman Empire into one polity. They enlisted in a legion for 25 years of service, a change from the early practice of enlisting only for a campaign. Legionaries expected to fight, but they also built much of the infrastructure of the Roman Empire and served as a policing force in the provinces. They built large public works projects, such as walls, bridges, and roads. The legionary's last five years of service were on lighter duties. Once retired, a Roman legionary received a parcel of land or its equivalent in money and often became a prominent member of society.  History  = Inception: Marius's reforms = When Gaius Marius became consul in 108 BC, Rome was at war with the Numidian king Jugurtha. Seeing a need for more manpower, Marius eliminated the property requirements that used to qualify Romans into the army, allowing any Roman citizen to become a legionary. After the war, Marius set out to professionalize and standardize the Roman legionary. He greatly enhanced the training of the soldiers and uniformly armed them, giving Rome an armed force that did not have to be raised with every new campaign. He further gave his soldiers retirement benefits, such as land or monetary payment. However, because the legionaries looked to their generals for their rewards and benefits, they soon became loyal to generals rather than the Roman senate. This would eventually factor in to the end of the Roman republic. = During the Principate = As Augustus consolidated power in 27BC and founded the Principate, he further professionalized the Roman legionary and sought to break the legionary's dependence on his general. Under him, a legionary's term of service was raised to 25 years (before that, a legionary's average term of service was only 10 years) and pay was standardized throughout the legions. The Roman legionaries were also guaranteed a land grant or a cash payment at the end of his service, making the Roman legionary less dependent on generals for rewards after campaigns. Augustus also changed the sacramentum so that soldiers swore allegiance only to the emperor, and not to the general. Thus, Augustus managed to end the civil wars which defined the late Roman Republic and created an army that was broadly loyal to only the emperor. Legionaries would expand Rome's borders to include lower Britannia, Dacia, North Africa, and more through military campaigns under Augustus and future emperors. = Decline = Clibinarii, a type of heavy cavalry in the late Roman Empire, grew in prominence along with other forms of cavalry as the Roman legionary declined. From the reign of Septimus Severus onward, the Roman legionary gradually lost his preeminence. Though there were multiple causes for this decline, all pointed to the gradual degradation of loyalty and/or discipline. Septimus Severus, perhaps unwittingly, began this decline when he lavished his legionaries with donatives and pay increases, recognising that they were his key to becoming and staying emperor. However, this proved detrimental to the discipline of the legionaries, as they began to expect more and more rewards from their emperors. Under Caracalla, Septimus Severus's successor, all freedmen in the Roman Empire became Roman citizens, effectively erasing the distinction between auxiliaries and legionaries. This, coinciding with the continued expansion of the Roman army, meant recruits of more dubious standards joined the legions, decreasing the quality of the Roman legionary further. During the 3rd Century Crisis, a more mobile army became necessary, as threats arose across the long borders of the Roman Empire. As such, mounted cavalry became essential to respond to the varied challenges to the empire. Because of this, Roman heavy infantry faded further from dominance. By the 4th century, Roman infantry lacked much of the body armor of the classical legionary and used darts rather than the pila of their predecessors.  Functions  Though the legionary was first and foremost a soldier, he provided a variety of other critical functions. Lacking a professional police force, governors would use legionaries to keep the peace and protect critical facilities. As the Roman empire lacked a large civil administration, the army would often be given many administrative positions. High ranking soldiers often acted as judges in disputes among local populations and the army was an important component of tax collection. Legionaries also served to spread Roman culture throughout the provinces where they were stationed. As legionaries settled in the provinces, towns sprang up around them, often becoming large cities. In this way, as legionaries co-mingled and intermarried with the local populace, they helped Romanize the provinces they protect. Roman legionaries served as a source of labor and expertise as well. As such, much of the infrastructure which connected the empire was built by legionaries. Roads, canals, and bridges were built by legionaries as well as more defensive structures such as fortresses and walls. Hadrian's wall, a monumental example of Roman engineering, was built by the three legions stationed in the area. Legionaries were not just limited to building large-scale engineering projects. Surveyors, doctors, artisans, and engineers within the army would be used for a variety of different civil services along with their normal military role.  Immunes  Regular trained legionaries were known as milites and were the equivalent in rank of the modern private. Included in the ranks, aside from the milites, were the immunes, specialist soldiers with secondary roles such as engineer, artilleryman, drill and weapons instructor, carpenter and medic. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and would fight in the ranks if called upon. They were excused from some of the more arduous tasks such as drill and fatigues and received better pay than their comrades in arms.  Recruitment  Though Roman legionaries were predominantly made up of volunteer citizens, conscription of recruits continued through Republic era and into the Principate, especially in times of crisis. This meant that levees remained a significant part of the Roman legions. With the state providing the equipment to the recruits and no property requirements, even the poorest Roman citizens were able to join the legions. However, the army was viewed as an honorable and valued profession. With a steady pay, good retirement benefits, and even certain legal advantages, a legionary had many perks that common citizens found desirable. As such, though poor citizens could join the military, members from across the plebeian class were found in the Roman legions. Indeed, the army served as one of the few avenues of upward mobility in the Roman world. The army actively sought out recruits with useful skills such as smiths, carpenters, and butchers. Though not required, literacy was useful since promotion to higher ranks such as centurion required a knowledge of writing. During the Later Republic, Roman legionaries predominantly came from the areas surrounding Rome. However, as Rome expanded, recruits began to come from other areas in Italy. Slowly, recruits came from the regions where the legions were stationed rather than from Italy itself. By the reign of Trajan, there were 4-5 legionaries originating from the provinces for every legionary originating from Italy.  Equipment  When on the march in hostile territory, the legionary would carry or wear full armour, supplies and equipment. This commonly consisted of lorica hamata, lorica squamata, or 1st‚Äì3rd century lorica segmentata, shield (scutum), helmet (galea), two javelins (one heavy pilum and one light verutum), a short sword (gladius), a dagger (pugio), a belt (balteus), a pair of heavy sandals (caligae), a pair of greaves, a pair of manicas, a marching pack (sarcina), about fourteen days' worth of food, a waterskin (bladder for posca), cooking equipment, two stakes (sudes murale) for the construction of palisades, and a shovel, and a wicker basket. After the military reforms of Emperor Claudius (circa 41 BCE), each Legion would also be requisitioned a certain number of artillery pieces. Each cohort (roughly 480 men) would receive one Ballista; and each century (roughly 80 men) would receive one Carroballista. In a standard Legionary formation of ten cohorts and sixty centuries, a Legion would be equipped with ten Ballista and sixty Carroballista.  Battle and combat  = Maintaining morale = The Roman legionary fought first and foremost with his contubernium, the basic eight man unit of the Roman army. The men of the same contubernium fought, slept, ate, and trained together. This strong sense of camaraderie gave Roman legionaries a sense of pride and kept them fighting on the battlefield. The standard bearers, signiferi, were of great importance in keeping Roman soldiers in the battle. The loss of a standard was a disgrace to the century the standard belonged to. As such, standard bearers served as someone to rally around and as someone to exhort legionaries to battle. Optiones, Roman officers at the rear of a formation, had many essential roles outside of battle. However, during battle, their task was to prevent legionaries from routing. Carrying a staff with a ball-end, an optio would force legionaries fleeing from battle back into formation. Leading at the front, centurions would fight alongside legionaries under their command, serving as a role model for his legionaries to remain in combat. Finally, there were the rewards and punishments, which served as both incentives and deterrents for legionaries in battle. For example, the highly coveted corona civica was given to legionaries who saved a comrade in battle. However, death was the punishment for a variety of different offenses. Those who committed cowardice and dereliction of duty were stoned to death by their comrades. On very rare occasions when a whole unit displayed cowardice, the unit might be decimated, in which one out of every ten soldiers were executed. Less extreme punishments included demotions, changing the wheat rations to barley, and the removal of some identifying military gear. = Prelude to battle = Large armies would generally not begin battle immediately upon meeting. Rather, days or even weeks of redeployment and negotiation would take place before battle. Several days of maneuvering occurred before the Battle of Pharsalus began. Before battle, measures were taken to ensure legionaries were as effective as possible. These include giving legionaries their meals and resting them before the battle. Their commanders and general would also give speeches during this time. These speeches would heavily emphasize the amount of plunder and riches that winning the battle would give the legionaries, as this was a primary incentive for the legionaries to do battle. Light skirmishing would then take place, with cavalry and auxiliaries probing enemy lines before a pitched battle commenced. = Fighting style = The Roman scutum ranged all the way from flat and oval to curved and rectangular as shown in the image above. The metal boss in all Roman scuta gave them an offensive capability. The Roman legionary's three principal weapons were the pilum (javelin), scutum (shield), and gladius (short sword). Ideally, the legionaries would throw their pila first as they approach the enemy army. These pila could often penetrate enemy shields and hit the soldiers behind them. Even if the pila fail to pierce the shields, the neck of the javelin would bend, making the shield useless. This then makes the enemy vulnerable to missile fire and legionary attack. The disruption and damage wrought by pila would then be followed by the charge of Roman legionaries. Though Roman scutum have various different designs, they all share a large metal boss in the center of the shield. This allows the legionary to not only use the scutum as defensive equipment but also as an offensive weapon. Legionaries would have used this iron boss to punch and shove the enemy combatants. Accompanying this is the gladius, a primarily stabbing weapon though it can also be used to cut. These fairly simple tools combined with impressive discipline made the Roman legionary an extremely effective soldier in the ancient world. Though there were many different formations that legionaries fought in, they tended toward close ordered formations with gaps between units. These gaps would allow for reserve units to enter battle or serve as avenues for skirmishing forces to retreat back behind the legionaries. During lulls in the battle, wounded soldiers can further be taken back behind battle lines through these gaps.  Pay and conditions  A denarius, or silver coin used for Roman commerce. In the 3rd century crisis, it underwent rapid inflation and devaluation. During the Pax Romana, a rank-and-file Roman legionary would be paid 225 denarii per year. This was increased to 300 denarii during the reign of Domitian. However, during the third century crisis, inflation and chaos disrupted a legionary's pay, with emperors often letting legionaries seize goods from civilians. Their income was supplemented by donatives from emperors either to secure a legion's loyalty or to award them after a successful campaign. Plunder and loot also supplement a legionary's income and is used as a large incentive for soldiers to follow their emperor in campaigns. At the end of their years of service, Roman legionaries received a small allotment of land or a monetary equivalent. As the Roman empire solidified, permanent legionary fortresses were constructed and many grew into towns. These fortresses contained bathhouses, taverns, and even amphitheaters where festivals and animal displays were held. However, legionaries were not allowed to legally marry until the reign of Septimius Severus (though their spouses were often recognized), most likely because of the implicit necessity to care for the widow in the event of a legionary's death. = Training and discipline = When first enlisted, a fresh Roman recruit (tiro) was not given real weapons to train with. Instead, he was given wooden swords and shields designed to be twice the weight of their counterparts in battle. This allowed the recruit to develop strength as he trained with these wooden weapons. Alongside battle training, the recruit was also taught other necessary skills such as swimming and setting up camp. Most of all, however, the recruit was taught discipline, and was drilled twice a day during his training period. After this period, which could last up to six months, the recruit would become a milite and sent to his respective legion. The Roman soldier underwent especially rigorous training throughout his military career; discipline was the base of the army's success, and the soldiers were relentlessly and constantly trained with weapons and especially with drill‚Äîforced marches with full load and in tight formation were frequent. As discipline was important, infractions were heavily punished by the centurions. Punishments could range from being obliged to spend the night outside the protective security of a fortified camp, through being beaten with clubs (fustuarium‚Äîa common punishment for 'slowpokes' during long marches), to the stoning of individuals or unit executions involving decimation. However, honors, rewards, and promotions were frequently awarded to legionaries who distinguished themselves in battle or through exemplary service. One of the goals for strong disciplinary training was to expel fear from a Roman soldier. Fear, and the panic that often follows, is a devastating force to an army on the battlefield. The Romans aimed to remove fear through strict physical and mental training. However, a different fear was used to motivate a soldier in spite of the fear of battle; that was the fear of harsh punishment by their commanding officers. In the words of Josephus \\"they are moreover hardened for war by fear; for their laws inflict capital punishments, not only for soldiers running away from the ranks, but for slothfulness and inactivity\\". = Diet = A Roman legionary had two meals per day: The prandium (breakfast) and the cena (dinner). For these meals, the soldiers were issued regular rations consisting mainly of wheat, which composed roughly 60‚Äì70% of a soldier's total rations. This would be consumed in the form of either bread or porridge. However, while on campaign, the soldiers would cook their wheat rations into hardtack, a long-lasting biscuit. Supplementing the soldier's wheat rations was the cibaria, rations other than grain. This included a variety of foodstuffs but mainly wine, vinegar, vegetables (largely beans or lentils), salt, salt-pork, cheese, and olive oil. However, this did not include fruit. Through foraging, trade with merchants, requisitioning, or raiding during campaigns, the Roman legionary could obtain other foodstuffs not included in his rations. In combination, the average soldier's diet was generally nutritious and filling. = Healthcare = Permanent Roman forts would contain hospitals, where doctors (medici) operated on wounded, injured, or sick legionaries. These medical personnel also isolated sick soldiers, thereby reducing the chance of a possibly infectious disease spreading through the army. Roman forts and camps were also planned in such a way as to minimize the spread of water-borne illnesses, which ravaged many ancient armies. Engineers took special care in piping fresh water to the camps and carrying sewage downstream of any watering places. Those legionaries who were seriously and permanently wounded or injured would be granted missio causaria, or a medical discharge. This discharge would come with many benefits including exemption from some taxes and some civic duties.  Other legionaries  Legionary is also a term used for members of various military forces which have been accorded the title of \\"legion\\", although bearing no resemblance to the heavy infantry of ancient Rome. In the 18th and early 19th century this designation was sometimes accorded to units which comprised both mounted and foot components. More recently the title has been used by the French Foreign Legion, the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Polish Legions. Members of these modern legions are often called l√©gionnaires, the French term for legionary. The term was also used by the Romanian far right paramilitary group known in English as the Iron Guard.

He is best known for leading the resistance to Barry St. Leger's Siege of Fort Stanwix in 1777. Gansevoort was also the maternal grandfather of Moby-Dick author Herman Melville. Early life Peter Gansevoort was born into the Dutch aristocracy of Albany, New York. His parents were Harman Gansevoort (1712‚Äì1801), the third generation of his family to live in America, and Magdalena Douw (1718‚Äì1796). His younger brother was Leonard Gansevoort, who was more active politically, serving in the state assembly and senate, as well as the Continental Congress. Gansevoort's paternal ancestors had been in Albany since 1660, when it was the Dutch colony of Fort Orange, and Harmen Harmense Gansevoort owned a brewery and farms. Through his mother, he was related to New York's Van Rensselaer family as her mother, and Gansevoort's maternal grandmother, was Anna Van Rensselaer (1696‚Äì1756), a daughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer, the director of the Eastern patent of the Rensselaerswyck manor. In addition, his first cousin, Leonard Gansevoort (1754‚Äì1834), an Albany lawyer and alderman, was married to Maria Van Rensselaer (1760‚Äì1841), the daughter of Col. Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1717‚Äì1781), the granddaughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer and the sister of Henry Van Rensselaer (1744‚Äì1816), Philip Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1747‚Äì1798), and Killian K. Van Rensselaer (1763‚Äì1845). Career =American Revolution= As the American Revolution grew closer, Peter Gansevoort joined the Albany County militia. While he lacked the experience of many older officers, he was a tactful and persuasive leader. Even at his young age, he was over six feet tall, and had a commanding presence. This, along with his family connections, caused Gen. Philip Schuyler to give him a commission. =Invasion of Quebec= At the start of the American Revolution, Gansevoort joined the Continental Army. He was commissioned as a Major on June 30, 1775 and served as a field commander in the 2nd New York Regiment. Goose Van Schaick was the regiment's Colonel; he had raised it, and served as its nominal commander. Lieutenant Colonel Peter W. Yates had been the regiment's primary field commander, but remained as commander of Fort George when Major Gansevoort led much of the regiment north with Richard Montgomery's forces for the invasion of Quebec (1775). Gansevoort led the regiment during the siege of Fort St. Jean, today known by its French name of Fort Saint-Jean. In late October, to improve the effect of the siege, Montgomery sent Gansevoort and his men down the river to seize Fort Chambly. At Chambly, they captured over 120 barrels of needed gunpowder and a huge mortar which they nicknamed the Old Sow. They also took about 100 prisoners of the Welch Fusilier garrison and their young Captain, John Andr√©. Montgomery used the Old Sow to open fire on St. Johns, which was compelled to surrender on November 2, 1775. Gansevoort took part in the capture of Montreal, although he became ill during that attack. He started on the advance to Quebec City, but by the time the force reached Trois-Rivi√®res, he was being carried on a stretcher. He returned to Montreal and spent the winter as one of the sick with the occupation force. By the spring of 1776, the invasion fell apart at Quebec; Montgomery had been killed, and Benedict Arnold was wounded. Gansevoort had recovered to the point where he led the remaining New York forces south in a fighting withdrawal that stopped the British advance at Lake Champlain. As recognition for his accomplishment, in June 1776, he was assigned to command Fort George. Statue of Peter Gansevoort, Rome, NY =Siege of Fort Stanwix= In November, Gansevoort was promoted to Colonel and given command of the 3rd New York Regiment. which he recruited and trained in early 1777. Lt. Colonel Marinus Willett became his second in command. His area of responsibility was extended from the Hudson River valley and Fort Edward and Fort George, along the Mohawk River Valley to Fort Oswego in the northwest. This was to be the axis of Colonel Barry St. Leger's attack during the Saratoga campaign. The 3rd New York did not have the men and equipment to extend that far, even with the support of local militia units. He conceded Fort Oswego to the British, and elected to defend Fort Stanwix (near modern Rome, New York). The fort had been abandoned after the French and Indian War and was in ruins. He and Willett restored the fort and strengthened its defenses. They hurriedly set up a garrison, getting the last boatload of supplies into the fort under fire from St. Leger's advance force on August 2. He and his more than 700-strong garrison withstood the three-week-long siege, making a sortie on August 6, while much of St. Leger's force was occupied in the Battle of Oriskany. The siege was lifted on August 22, after word arrived that Benedict Arnold was leading a large relief force up the Mohawk Valley. He received the grateful thanks of the Congress, as John Adams noted that \\"Gansevoort has proven that it is possible to hold a fort.\\" =1778‚Äì1781= Gansevoort eventually turned Fort Stanwix over to a garrison of the 1st New York Regiment. He moved his headquarters to his new command at Fort Saratoga (near modern Schuylerville, New York). He led his regiment in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. He had another bout of illness that winter (1779‚Äì1780) and returned home for a while, but, by July 1780, he was back with the 3rd at West Point. He was assigned to command the New York Brigade, and reestablished his headquarters at Fort Saratoga. In the reorganization and downsizing of the New York Line in 1781, Gansevoort was left with no assignment in the Continental Army. He returned home and became Brigadier General of the Albany County Militia. In 1783 he became an Original Member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. thumb =Post-Revolution= After the war, Gansevoort continued to make his home in Albany where he operated the family brewery. He expanded his farms, adding grist mills and a lumber mill, in the area that eventually became Gansevoort, New York. In 1790, he served for a while as sheriff of Albany County, as a commissioner of Indian affairs, and continued his support of the military in the militia and as a quartermaster. In 1800, he ran for US Senator from New York but was defeated by Gouverneur Morris of the Federalist Party. In 1809, he was made a Brigadier General in the United States Army and commanded the Army's Northern Department. In 1811, he was called on to preside over the court-martial of General James Wilkinson. Wilkinson was found not guilty, and the court adjourned on Christmas Day. Hurrying back to his family, he suffered a recurrence of his old illness, and he never recovered, dying the next Summer. Personal life Catherine Van Schaick Gansevoort, portrait by Ezra Ames On January 12, 1778, he had married Catherine \\"Katy\\" Van Schaick (1752‚Äì1830) in her family's home on Van Schaick Island, Cohoes, New York. She was the daughter of Wessel and Maria Van Schaik, and her cousin Goose Van Schaick had been Peter's commander and Colonel in 1775. Over the years, they had six children, five of whom lived past infancy, including: * Herman Gansevoort (1779‚Äì1862), who married Catherine S. Quackenbush (1774‚Äì1855) in 1813. * Wessel Gansevoort (1781‚Äì1862), who never married. * Leonard Herman Gansevoort (1783‚Äì1821), who married Mary Ann Chandonette (1789‚Äì1851) * Peter Gansevoort (1788‚Äì1876), who married Mary Sanford (1814‚Äì1841), a daughter of Chancellor Nathan Sandford. After her death, he married Susan Lansing (1804‚Äì1874), great-niece of John Lansing, Jr., in 1843. * Maria Gansevoort (1791‚Äì1872), who married Allan Melvill (1782‚Äì1832), son of Thomas Melvill, in 1814. He died at home in Albany on July 2, 1812. he is buried at Albany Rural Cemetery. =Descendants= His grandson through his son Leonard was Guert Gansevoort, who had a distinguished naval career that spanned 45 years. Through his daughter Maria, he was the maternal grandfather of author Herman Melville (1819‚Äì1891). His eldest son, Herman, built the Gansevoort Mansion in 1813 on his father's tract at Gansevoort in Saratoga County, New York. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.  Further reading  * Alice P.

His right hand is raised in benediction. A benediction (Latin: bene, well + dicere, to speak) is a short invocation for divine help, blessing and guidance, usually at the end of worship service. It can also refer to a specific Christian religious service including the exposition of the eucharistic host in the monstrance and the blessing of the people with it. Christianity Benediction given by a Lutheran priest at the Lutheran Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Moscow Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament at Sacred Heart Chaplaincy, Cagayan de Oro, Philippines. From the earliest church, Christians adopted ceremonial benedictions into their liturgical worship, particularly at the end of a service. Such benedictions have been regularly practiced both in the Christian East and West. Among the benedictions of the Roman Catholic Church, include the Apostolic Benediction made by the Pope and his delegates, and the \\"last blessing\\" of the dying. The Anglican Church retained the principle of benediction after the Protestant Reformation, and as a result, the benediction or blessing ends most Anglican, as well as Methodist, services of worship. A common form of benediction in Baptist and liturgical Protestant churches is for the worship leader to raise his hands and recite the words of the biblical Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26 KJV). This addition to the Mass was made by Martin Luther in his Deutsche Messe and remains traditional in Lutheran Churches.Precht, Fred L. Lutheran Worship History and Practice. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1993. p. 434. Many Protestant denominations, such as the Methodist Church, incorporate the use of benedictions in the closing of their church services. Such benedictions may be taken from Scripture, written by a church member, or a combination of the two. An often complex and lengthy blessing before communion took place in the mass of the Gallican Rite and in some French sees survived until the Gallican rites controversy when they were suppressed. Pope John Paul II, however, gave permission for these sees to restore this traditional element of their local rite. In the Orthodox Church, benedictions will occur at both the beginning and the end of each service, and there may be other benedictions during the course of the service. The final benediction (the dismissal) is the most important, and will often entail mention of the feast or saint being commemorated that day. The priest will bless with his right hand, and the bishop will bless with both hands. In both cases, the hand is held so that the fingers form the initials IC XC (the abbreviation for \\"Jesus Christ\\" in Greek), and he traces the Sign of the Cross in the air with his hand. If a bishop or abbot is holding his crozier while making the benediction, he will raise his right hand and trace the Sign of the Cross with both his crozier and right hand, crossing the one in front of the other. More solemn benedictions, such as that which comes at the end of the Divine Liturgy, will be made with a blessing cross rather than the hand. =Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament= One of the most generally popular services in the Roman Catholic Church is Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, commonly referred to as Benediction and known in France as Salut and in Germany as Segen. It is also the custom of some high-church Anglican churches to hold this service. It is ordinarily an afternoon or evening devotion and consists in the singing of certain hymns, or litanies, or canticles, before the Blessed Sacrament, which is exposed upon the altar in a monstrance and is surrounded with candles. At the end, the priest or deacon, his shoulders enveloped in a humeral veil, takes the monstrance into his hands and with it makes the sign of the cross in silence over the kneeling congregation. Benediction is often employed as a conclusion to other services, e.g. Vespers, Compline, Evensong, the Stations of the Cross, but it is also still more generally treated as a rite complete in itself. There is a good deal of diversity of usage in different countries with regard to details, but some of the elements are constant. The use of incense and wax candles, the singing of the \\"Tantum ergo\\" with its versicle and prayer, and the blessing given with the Blessed Sacrament are obligatory everywhere. In Rome, the only portion of the service which is to be regarded as strictly liturgical is the singing of the \\"Tantum ergo\\" and the giving of the Benediction which immediately follows. This idea is emphasized by the fact that in many Roman churches the celebrant, vested in cope and preceded by thurifer, acolytes, etc., only makes his entry into the sanctuary just before the \\"Tantum ergo\\" is begun. Preceding this, the Blessed Sacrament is exposed, informally, by a priest in cotta and stole; and then choir and congregation are left to sing litanies and canticles, or to say prayers and devotions as the occasion may demand. In English-speaking countries the service generally begins with the entry of the priest and his assistants in procession and with the singing of the \\"O Salutaris Hostia\\" as soon as the Blessed Sacrament is taken out of the tabernacle. In England the singing of the \\"O Salutaris\\" is enjoined in the \\"Ritus servandus\\", the code of procedure approved by a former synod of the Province of Westminster. The Litany of Our Lady, though usually printed after the \\"O Salutaris\\" and very generally sung at Benediction, is not obligatory. Further solemnity is often given to the service by the presence of deacon and subdeacon in dalmatics. When the bishop of the diocese officiates he uses mitre and crosier in the procession to the altar, and makes the sign of the cross over the people three times in giving the benediction. Otherwise, when the means for carrying out a more elaborate rite are not available, an informal service is permitted. The priest, wearing cotta and stole, simply opens the tabernacle door. Prayers and devotions are said or sung, and then the priest blesses those present with the veiled ciborium before the tabernacle door is again closed. The permission, general or special, of the bishop of the diocese is necessary for services where Benediction is given with the monstrance.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02465b.htm Judaism Judaism developed ritualised benedictions (Berachot) for use at the Temple of Jerusalem, and the home. The Hebrew verb (brkh) means 'to fall on one's knees'.\\"Benedictions\\". Encyclopedia Judaica. Jerusalem : Encyclopaedia Judaica ; [New York] : Macmillan. v. 4 p. 484.

Construction and commissioning deck. The external fairing on the lower hull was temporary, designed to provide added buoyancy for her bow and avoid excessive strain on her hull during her launching. The contract to build Sand Lance was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, on 24 October 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 15 January 1965. She was launched on 11 November 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas J. McIntyre, and commissioned on 25 September 1971 with Commander William A. Kennington in command. Sand Lance was the last ship to be constructed for the Navy at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Service history On the day of her commissioning, Sand Lances home port was changed from Portsmouth to Charleston, South Carolina. She spent the remainder of 1971 on shakedown. She operated in the Charleston area for the whole of 1972, then, in February 1973, stood out of Charleston for special operations. She returned to Charleston on 21 April 1973, remained in port until 11 June 1973, and then departed again on special operations. She completed these operations in August 1973 and put in at Faslane Naval Base, Scotland, on 13 August 1973. Sand Lance left Faslane on 20 August 1973 and arrived in Charleston on 5 September 1973. Sand Lance was sent to the Mediterranean to monitor shipping going through the Straits of Gibraltar during the Yom Kippur War. She then operated out of Charleston in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through at least June 1974. She went through overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in 1975 and 1976 (15 months). In 1987, Sand Lance completed Law Enforcement Operations in the Caribbean Sea and was transferred to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery Maine for a refueling overhaul, replacement of propeller (screw), and upgrades to hull coatings. She underwent sea trials in 1990 and returned to active service out of Charleston, SC. In 1991 the Sand Lance was deployed for six months as part of the UNITAS task force around South America. She traveled through the Panama Canal and around the southernmost tip of South America. From October 1993 to March 1994 the Sand Lance was on a Mediterranean Sea Deployment and called on ports at Naples, Italy; Monte Carlo, Monaco; U.S. Naval Support Activity Base Santo Stefano Island, Italy; Toulon, France, and Gibraltar. In 1994 Sand Lance, while moored at Charleston, almost sank next to the pier ahead of one of her sister ships, the attack submarine , due to flooding in the engine room's lower level when a main seawater hull valve was being removed for maintenance. Plates, called blanks, had been placed over her hull penetrations by divers to avoid flooding during removal of the valve but had been placed over the wrong main seawater openings. The flooding was stopped, but not before most of the engine room's lower level was flooded. In 1995, the Sand Lance left Charleston and relocated to a new homeport in Groton, Connecticut, where she became a member of Submarine Squadron 2. In 1996, the Sand Lance was sent on a patrol to the Arctic Circle. While there, the submarine surfaced through the polar ice cap at the North Pole on 12 July. Decommissioning and disposal Sand Lance was decommissioned on 7 August 1998 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 April 1998 and was completed on 30 August 1999. Sand Lance's Maneuvering Room Consoles, which were used to control the engines, electrical systems and nuclear reactor were displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. and are now stored there in the event of future exhibits involving nuclear submarines.

Tivaevae or tivaivai () in the Cook Islands, tifaifai in French Polynesia, is a form of artistic quilting traditionally done by Polynesian women. The word literally means \\"patches\\", in reference to the pieces of material sewn together. The tivaevae are either made by one woman or can be created in groups of women called vainetini. The vainetini use this time together to bond, sing and catch up on village news. Traditional uses Tivaevae are often given on very special occasions either to important visitors, as birthday and wedding gifts or used to cover the body of a loved one who has died. They are often displayed during important events like the traditional boys' hair-cutting ceremonies, birthdays and weddings. By custom, a tivaevae is not measured by monetary value nor production cost. Its value is said to be reflected by the love and patience that the creator(s) have put into making a stunning work of art. Cook Islands women often described their tivaevae as being \\"something from the heart\\". Tivaevae are rarely seen for sale on the islands. The Atiu Fibre Arts Studio on Atiu is the only place in the Cook Islands where they are commercially produced and available for purchase. History The tivaevae's origins are uncertain. Rongokea (1992) believes it to be an imported art form, and cites two sets of Christian missionaries in the 19th century as possible origins. While it is known that these female missionaries taught the indigenous women how to sew, it is not certain that they taught them the craft of quilting or making bed coverlets. The appliqu√© style of tivaevae quilting appears to have been influence by Pennsylvanian German scherenschnitte or Victorian folded paper- cutting traditions. Multiple origins and influences thus seem likely. As an art form, tivaevae replaced barkcloth production in Tahiti and the Cook Islands by the late 19th century: the function and nature of barkcloth production was transferred to tivaevae.

PEP is normally considered the occasional or continuously repeating crest of the modulation envelope under normal operating conditions. The United States Federal Communications Commission uses PEP to set maximum power standards for amateur radio transmitters.R. Dean Straw, ed. ARRL Handbook For Radio Amateurs. Newington, Connecticut: American Radio Relay League, 1999, p. 6.7 AM PEP Assuming linear, perfectly symmetrical, 100% modulation of a carrier, PEP output of an AM transmitter is four times its carrier PEP; in other words, a typical modern 100-watt amateur transceiver is usually rated for no more than, and often less than, 25 watts carrier output when operating in AM.R. Dean Straw, ed. ARRL Handbook For Radio Amateurs. Newington, Connecticut: American Radio Relay League, 1999, p. 15.6 PEP vs. Average Power PEP is equal to steady carrier power, or radiotelegraph dot or dash average power, in a properly-formed CW transmission. PEP is also equal to average power in a steady FM, FSK, or RTTY transmission. Although average power is the same as PEP for complex modulation forms, such as FSK, the peak envelope power bears no particular ratio or mathematical relationship to longer-term average power in distorted envelopes, such as a CW waveform with power overshoot, or with amplitude modulated waveforms, such as SSB or AM voice transmissions. Typical average power of a SSB voice transmission, for example, is 10-20% of PEP. The percentage of longer term average power to PEP increases with processing, and commonly reaches ~50% with extreme speech processing. PEP Level Control Most modern amateur transceivers sample PEP to adjust power, using an ALC (automatic level control) system. Time delay in the ALC system and finite time of RF signals passing through multiple stages, in particular narrow filters, often gives rise to unusual envelope distortion. This distortion commonly appears as envelope power overshoot on leading edges, and sometimes causes negative carrier shift on AM. Some more poorly designed transceivers have a short term envelope power overshoot several times the steady-state PEP setting. This envelope overshoot further complicates definitions of PEP and average power. PEP was often used in non-broadcast AM applications because it most accurately described the potential of mobile transmitters to interfere with each other. Its use is now somewhat deprecated, with the average transmitter power output (or sometimes average effective radiated power) now typically being preferred.

Corona was a late 19th-century residential development in the northeastern corner of the old Town of Newtown. Real estate speculators from New York started the community in 1854, the same year that the New York and Flushing Railroad began service to the area largely to serve a newly opened race course. It was at the Fashion Race Course in 1858 that the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the All Stars of Brooklyn and the All Stars of New York, are commonly believed to be the first all star baseball games and in essence the birthplace of professional baseball. A trophy baseball from this tournament sold in 2005 for nearly $500,000. Accessed August 5, 2013The 1858 Fashion Race Course Baseball Match Baseball Almanac. Accessed August 5, 2013. During the second half of the 1940s through the 1960s, many legendary African American musicians, civil rights leaders and athletes moved to the neighborhood. In the last half of the 20th century, Corona saw dramatic ethnic successions. In the 1950s, what was predominantly an Italian American and African American neighborhood began to give way to an influx of Dominicans. In the late 1990s, Corona saw a new wave of immigrants from Latin America. The area north of Roosevelt Avenue contained the heart of the historic African American community. The intersection of 108th Street and Corona Avenue is the historic center of the Italian American community, sometimes referred to as Corona Heights. The majority Hispanic community now consists of Dominicans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Bolivians, Peruvians, Mexicans, Venezuelans, and Chileans. There are also Asian Americans (Chinese, Indians, Koreans, Filipinos, and Japanese) as well as Italian Americans and African Americans.11368 Zip Code Detailed Profile, City-Data.com.

Founded in 1944 by Peter Benfaremo, it is a neighborhood point of interest. The shop attracts international tourists due to having been featured in the opening credits of the TV show King of Queens. Corona used to have three kettle ponds. One of them, Linden Pond, was located a block south of 103rd Street‚ÄìCorona Plaza station and was the centerpiece of Park of the Americas, located near the original center of Corona. The pond had become a public health hazard by the early 20th century, and was renovated in 1912; it was removed altogether when the park was renovated in 1947. The second was Shady Lake, located at what is now the intersection of 53rd Avenue, Corona Avenue, and 108th Street. The pond, originally used to harvest ice, was drained in the 20th century; the Lemon Ice King of Corona and William F. Moore Park are now located near the site. A third, Backus Lake at 98th Street and 31st Avenue, was also considered a nuisance by the 1900s, and was drained in 1917. =Corona Plaza= Corona Plaza, located at Roosevelt Avenue and National Street, was previously an underutilized lot and truck route that was transformed over the course of several years into a pedestrian plaza for community programming and inclusive living. In the latter half of the 20th century, the area that is now Corona Plaza was a lot that connected the street to a row of mainly immigrant-owned businesses. The neighborhood of Corona had an overflow of immigrants who struggled to find employment which exacerbated illegal trading, much of which would occur through the use of trucks that could park in this unofficial lot. By the early 21st century, Corona Plaza was gradually given more attention and became a community space for the ethnically diverse population of Corona. In 2005, the nearby Queens Museum began applying for permits to temporarily close off the streets that allowed vehicle access to the plaza and hosted public events (typically art based) that the residents of the community could attend. Seeing the lot's future potential, the Queens Museum partnered with the Queens Economic Development Corporation (QEDC) to develop plans to reuse the space. The partners saw this as an opportunity for grassroots, art-led engagement that would unite residents. The two groups' individual intentions both contributed to the creation of the permanent plaza: the QEDC supports developing local businesses while the Queens Museum creates a stronger presence in the neighborhood for its arts programs, The space was first transformed in 2012 as a temporary plaza with chairs and tables that prohibited through traffic. It was later made permanent by the Department of Design and Construction, which filled in the lot with concrete, added built-in seating and a performance space, new pedestrian lighting, and plants to reinforce the liveliness. Later added was a drinking fountain, WalkNYC wayfinding signs, bike racks to serve commuters, an automatic pay toilet, and more furniture. Maintenance and technical assistance (including daily cleaning) services for the plaza are funded by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), which has also partnered with the Queens Museum to bring programming to the newly transformed space. The plaza was fully implemented in early 2018 at a cost of around $5.6 million. Corona Plaza is recognized by urban planning circles as a project that has created a new community space.

It is bounded by Roosevelt Avenue on the north; the Long Island Expressway on the south; Junction Boulevard on the east; and the New York Connecting Railroad on the west. The village was established in 1652 by the Dutch as Middleburgh and was a suburb of New Amsterdam. When the British took over New Netherland in 1664, they renamed Middleburgh as New Town to maintain a connection to the Dutch heritage. This was eventually simplified to Newtown. It remained a rural community until the late 1890s, when Newtown was renamed Elmhurst and became part of the City of Greater New York.

Accessed May 5, 2017. History = 17th and 18th centuries = The village was established in 1652 by the Dutch as ('Middleburgh') and was a suburb of New Amsterdam () in the colony of New Netherland (). The original European settlers of Elmhurst were from the nearby colony of Maspat (now called Maspeth), following threats and attacks by local Lenape Native Americans (later known as the Delaware by the English). When the British took over New Netherland in 1664, they renamed Middleburgh as New Town () to maintain a connection to the Dutch heritage. This was eventually simplified to Newtown. In a deed dated July 9, 1666, the settlers took title to the lands of Newtown from the Native American tribes. A town building, near what is now Broadway and Dongan Street, was erected to serve as both a community and religious building. Use of this building was shared by the different religious denominations in Middleburgh: the Church of England, the Dutch Reformed Church, the Presbyterians, and the Quakers. In 1669, the town planned a new church for all of these denominations, on a plot of land donated by Ralph Hunt near Grand Avenue and Queens Boulevard. According to the town records, the new building was to cost forty pounds, half in corn and half in cattle. The village of Newtown was established as the town seat for the township in 1683, when Queens County was reorganized as a \\"one county, five towns\\" model. The Town of Newtown, which had a town hall, jail, tax office, and town clerk's office, was the center of a municipality that comprised the villages that were located north of present-day Forest Park and west of Flushing Meadows. By 1700, the town had a population of 1,000, including 405 youths under the age of sixteen, 434 adults, and 161 slaves. Among the English settlers in the present Elmhurst section of Newtown was Gershom Moore, who lived at what is now the intersection of Broadway, 45th Avenue, and Elmhurst Avenue. A chance seedling on his farm eventually produced the Newtown Pippin, Colonial America's most famous apple.David, Karp. \\"It's Crunch Time for the Venerable Pippin\\", The New York Times, November 5, 2003. Accessed September 20, 2018. \\"The Newtown Pippin arose in the late 17th or early 18th century as a seedling in the Moore family orchard, which stretched from the East River to what is now 54th Street in Elmhurst (formerly Newtown), Queens.\\" The St. James Church was founded in 1704, followed by the Reformed Church of Newtown in 1731. The Colonel Bernardus Bloom Farmhouse at 90-11 56th Avenue, which existed from the 17th century to 2015, was one of the oldest surviving farmhouses in Newtown through the 21st century. = 19th century = 1910 map of old roads in New Town Newtown was also the center of a population of free blacks and slaves by the early 19th century. With the program of gradual abolition and the manumission of some slaves by masters following the American Revolution, the free population increased. In 1828, a year after slavery was finally abolished in the state, landowner James Hunter and his wife deeded two acres to the community for a church and parsonage. They had already been using land at Corona Avenue and 90th Street as a burial ground since about 1818. This was associated with the United African Society of Newtown, by 1906 known as St. Mark's A.M.E. Church. By 1886 more than 300 burials had been made in the cemetery. The church moved further east and gradually the burial ground was forgotten until remains were discovered of a woman in an iron coffin in 2011 during development. The church is hoping to buy the land for preservation. More concentrated residential development in the area was spurred by the completion of a horsecar line, the Grand Street Line, which reached New Town in 1854. The Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was built through Newtown in 1876, attracting more residents to the neighborhood. = Renaming and incorporation into city = Cord Meyer bought land at Broadway and Whitney Avenue in 1896. He proposed that the town be renamed \\"Elmhurst\\", meaning \\"a grove of elms\\"; in 1897, one year before Queens County was incorporated in the Greater City of New York, the town was renamed. The renaming was done partially to disassociate the town from nearby Maspeth and the smelly, polluted Newtown Creek, and partially to celebrate the elm trees (Ulmus americana) that abounded in the area. Elmhurst developed as a fashionable district due to a housing development built by the Cord Meyer Development Company between 1896 and 1910, north of the Port Washington Branch railroad station. Cord Meyer expanded its holdings between 1905 and 1930, including Elmhurst Square, Elmhurst South, Elmhurst Heights, and New Elmhurst. Elmhurst also was the site of the Grand Street LIRR station just west of the current Grand Avenue ‚Äì Newtown subway station. The Grand Street LIRR station was served by the Main Line and the former Rockaway Beach Branch. In the 1930s, the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard line was built through the neighborhood, spurring economic development but also destroying many old buildings. Prior to World War II, Elmhurst had become an almost exclusively Jewish and Italian neighborhood, made up of early 20th century immigrants and their descendants. Following the war, Elmhurst evolved into what has been considered one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in New York City, as immigrants arrived from new areas. By the 1980s, there were persons from 112 nations in residence in the neighborhood, which has continued to diversify since then. Among the most numerous ethnic groups that have settled in the area are Latinos and Chinese Americans. For many years, the Elmhurst gas tanks, a pair of large natural gas storage structures built in 1910 and 1921 on 57th Avenue between 74th and 80th Streets, were well-known landmarks, standing high. Because the Long Island Expressway frequently became congested in that area, \\"backup at the Elmhurst Gas Tanks\\" became a familiar phrase in radio traffic reporting. The gas storage facilities were removed in 2001. The site was redeveloped and opened as Elmhurst Park in 2011.Elmhurst Park, New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. Accessed July 7, 2016. \\"Elmhurst Park, once an eyesore and traffic landmark, opened to the public in 2011 as a magnificent community greenspace. The site of Elmhurst Park was once the location of two KeySpan Newtown gas holders, a highway landmark popularly known as the 'Elmhurst gas tanks.'\\"  Land use  Elmhurst contains a variety of zoning districts, including manufacturing, commercial, residential, and mixed-use. Much of the neighborhood is composed of detached or multi-family houses, though there are also rowhouse districts, apartment buildings of up to six or seven stories, and large developments such as LeFrak City. Commercial overlays are located primarily along Queens Boulevard, Broadway, and Grand and Corona Avenues. Several tracts are also zoned for shopping centers, which are occupied by Elmhurst's malls. Light-manufacturing zones are located near the western end of the neighborhood, mainly between the LIRR's Port Washington Branch and 51st Avenue. = Official landmarks = Some buildings in Elmhurst are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or are designated New York City Landmarks (NYCL): * Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Lodge Number 878 (NRHP, NYCL), built in 1923‚Äì1924, once the largest Elks lodge in the Eastern United States * First Presbyterian Church of Newtown (NRHP), built in 1895 * Newtown High School (NYCL), a Flemish Renaissance Revival-style building erected in 1921 and expanded in 1931 * Reformed Church of Newtown (NRHP, NYCL), one of the oldest wood churches in New York City, first established by Dutch immigrants in 1731 * St. James Church (NRHP, NYCL), built in 1735 and the oldest surviving Anglican building in the city The Elmhurst branch of the Jamaica Savings Bank was previously a New York City Landmark, but the designation was removed in 2005.

Jackson Heights is neighbored by North Corona to the east, Elmhurst to the south, Woodside to the west, northern Astoria (Ditmars-Steinway) to the northwest, and East Elmhurst to the northeast. Jackson Heights has an ethnically diverse community, with half the population having being foreign-born since the 2000s. According to the 2010 United States Census, the neighborhood has a population of 108,152. The site of Jackson Heights was a vast marsh named Trains Meadow until 1909 when Edward A. MacDougall's Queensboro Corporation bought of undeveloped land and farms. Jackson Heights Advertisement by The Queensboro Corporation The Queensboro Corporation named the land Jackson Heights after John C. Jackson, a descendant of one of the original Queens families and a respected Queens entrepreneur. Further development arose through the development of transit, and \\"garden apartments\\" and \\"garden homes\\" soon became prevalent in Jackson Heights. During the 1960s, Jackson Heights' white middle-class families began moving to the suburbs, and non-white residents began moving in. Jackson Heights retains much of its residential character in the modern day. It also has numerous commercial establishments clustered around 37th Avenue, as well as along several side streets served by subway stations. Much of the neighborhood is part of a national historic district called the Jackson Heights Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Part of the neighborhood was placed on a New York City historic district of the same name in 1993. Jackson Heights is located in Queens Community District 3 and its ZIP Code is 11372. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 115th Precinct. Politically, Jackson Heights is represented by the New York City Council's 21st and 25th districts.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History =Early history= From colonial times to the 1900s, the area now known as Jackson Heights was a vast marsh named Trains Meadow. Urbanization at the turn of the century was creating a New York City housing shortage and urban sprawl. In 1909, Edward A. MacDougall's Queensboro Corporation bought of undeveloped land and farms and christened them Jackson Heights after John C. Jackson, a descendant of one of the original Queens families and a respected Queens County entrepreneur.Marzlock, Ron. \\"Jackson Ave. and its namesake\\". Queens Chronicle. November 21, 2013. Northern Boulevard, a major thoroughfare that bisects the neighborhood, was also originally named Jackson Avenue; the name of this road is still retained in a short stretch between Queens Plaza and Queens‚ÄìMidtown Tunnel in Long Island City. Though the land was not especially known for its elevation, the addition of the term \\"Heights\\" echoed the prestige of the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights and indicated that Jackson Heights was meant to be an exclusive neighborhood. At that time the area could most easily be reached via a ferry from Manhattan or the Brooklyn Bridge; more direct access came with the Queensboro Bridge in 1909, followed by the elevated IRT Flushing Line‚Äîthe present-day , just 20 minutes from Manhattan‚Äîin 1917, and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company double-decker coaches in 1922. =Development= Jackson Heights was conceived as a planned development for middle- to upper-middle income workers looking to escape an overcrowded Manhattan. Inspired by Sir Ebenezer Howard's garden city movement,Karatzas, Daniel (1990). Jackson Heights: A Garden in the City. Privately printed it was laid out by Edward MacDougall's Queensboro Corporation in 1916 and began attracting residents after the arrival of the Flushing Line in 1917. The Queensboro Corporation coined the name \\"garden apartment\\" to convey the concept of apartments built around private parks. Although land for churches was provided, the apartments themselves were limited to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, excluding Jews, Blacks, and perhaps Greeks and Italians. Several of the buildings in Jackson Heights were built by the Queensboro Corporation as part of a planned community located a few blocks off of the Flushing Line between Northern Boulevard and 37th Avenue. Targeted toward the middle class, these multi-story apartment buildings designed in the Colonial Revival and neo-Tudor styles were based on similar ones in Berlin. They were to share garden spaces, have ornate exteriors and features such as fireplaces, parquet floors, sun rooms, and built-in bathtubs with showers; and be cooperatively owned. In addition, the corporation divided the land into blocks and building lots, as well as installed streets, sidewalks, and power, water, and sewage lines. The Laurel apartment building on 82nd Street at Northern Boulevard was the first of the Queensboro Corporation buildings in Jackson Heights, completed in 1914 with a small courtyard. The Greystones on either side of 80th Street between 37th and 35th avenues were completed in 1918 with a design by architect George H. Wells. There was leftover unused space, which was converted to parks, gardens, and recreational areas, including a golf course; much of this leftover space, including the golf course, no longer exists. This was followed by the 1919 construction of the Andrew J. Thomas‚Äìdesigned Linden Court, a 10-building complex between 84th Street, 85th Street, 37th Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue. The two sets of 5 buildings each, separated by a gated garden with linden trees and two pathways, included parking spaces with single-story garages accessed via narrow driveways, the first Jackson Heights development to do so; gaps at regular intervals in the perimeter wall; a layout that provided light and ventilation to the apartments, as well as fostered a sense of belonging to a community; the area's first co-op; and now- prevalent private gardens surrounded by the building blocks. The Hampton Gardens, the Ch√¢teau, and the Towers followed in the 1920s.\\"History of Jackson Heights ‚Äì A Garden City\\"; originally from Jeffrey A. Saunders's The Jackson Heights Garden City Trail, published by The Jackson Heights Garden City Society, Inc. The Ch√¢teau and the Towers, both co-ops on 34th Avenue, had large, airy apartments and were served by elevators. Prior to 1922, elevators were required to have attendants and more modest buildings were constructed as walk-ups not exceeding five floors. The elegant Ch√¢teau cooperative apartment complex, with twelve buildings surrounding a shared garden, was built in the French Renaissance style and have slate mansard roofs pierced by dormer windows, and diaperwork brick walls. At first purely decorative, the shared gardens in later developments included paved spaces where people could meet or sit. The Queensboro Corporation started the Ivy Court, Cedar Court, and Spanish Gardens projects, all designed by Thomas, in 1924. The Queensboro Corporation advertised their apartments from 1922 on. On August 28, 1922, the Queensboro Corporation paid $50 to the WEAF radio station to broadcast a ten- minute sales pitch for apartments in Jackson Heights, in what may have been the first \\"infomercial\\", opening with a few words about Nathaniel Hawthorne before promoting the corporation's Nathaniel Hawthorne apartments. The ad wanted viewers to: Built in 1928, the English Gables line 82nd Street, the main shopping area of Jackson Heights' Hispanic community. There are two developments, called English Gables I and II; they were meant to provide a gateway to the neighborhood for commercial traffic and for passengers from the 82nd Street ‚Äì Jackson Heights station. A year later, the Robert Morris Apartments, on 37th Avenue between 79th and 80th streets, were constructed. Named after Robert Morris, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, the apartments have ample green spaces, original high ceilings, and fireplaces, and are relatively expensive. During the Depression, two new buildings were built: Ravenna Court on 37th Avenue between 80th and 81st streets, built in 1929; and Georgian Court three blocks east, between 83rd and 84th streets, built in 1930. The Queensboro Corporation began to build on land that until then had been kept open for community use, including the tennis courts, community garden, and the former golf course‚Äîlocated between 76th and 78th streets and 34th and 37th avenues‚Äîall of which were built upon during the 1940s and 1950s.\\"History of Jackson Heights ‚Äì A Garden City\\"; originally from Jeffrey A. Saunders's The Jackson Heights Garden City Trail, published by The Jackson Heights Garden City Society, Inc. The corporation also began erecting traditional six-story apartment buildings. Dunolly Gardens, the last garden apartment designed by Andrew Thomas, was an exception, a modernistic group of six buildings completed in 1939. The corner windows, considered very innovative in the 1930s, gave the apartments a more spacious feeling, and the landscaped interior courtyard is one of the largest in the historic district. After the 1940s, Jackson Heights' real estate was diversified, with more apartment buildings and cooperatives built with elevators; some new transportation infrastructure were also built. In 1929, Holmes Airport opened in the northern section of Jackson Heights. Bordering St. Michaels Cemetery to the west, the airfield was also called the Grand Central Air Terminal and Grand Central Airport. Holmes Airport shut down in 1940, one year after LaGuardia Airport opened. = Social and demographic shifts = The neighborhood grew steadily from the 1920s to the 1950s, with construction slowing during the Depression and booming back again after World War II. Holmes Airport operated from 1929 to 1940 on adjacent to the community. Later, its land became veterans' housing and the Bulova watch factory site.  Ethnic tensions  By 1930, artists from the Manhattan theater district, many of whom were homosexual, had moved into the area, forming the beginnings of the second largest LGBTQ community in New York outside of Manhattan.Maly, Michael T. \\"Chapter 4: Jackson Heights.\\" Beyond Segregation: Multiracial and Multiethnic Neighborhoods in the United States, Temple University Press, 2011. Jews were allowed to move in by the 1940s. In the 1950s, middle-class businessmen from Colombia, escaping violence and repression in Latin America, brought their financial capital and their families to the community. Following the development of Long Island in the 1960s, Jackson Heights' white middle- class families began moving further out into the suburbs. At the same time the neighborhood experienced an influx of ethnically diverse professionals from Latin America and the Indian subcontinent taking advantage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, which allowed them to arrange the immigration of their families. White residents' resistance to integration with African-Americans continued late into the decade, and Junction Boulevard came to be called the \\"Mason-Dixon Line\\", as it divided Jackson Heights from the black communities in East Elmhurst and Corona.  Crime increases  By the mid-1970s, Roosevelt Avenue had become the neighborhood's commercial center and also gained national attention as a place for organized crime. A 1993 New York Times article detailed how wire transfer services, located in Jackson Heights, inadvertently enabled Colombian cartels to repatriate, and in the process launder, millions of dollars in drug money to South America alongside customers who used the service to transfer legally earned money. The violence that ensued as a result of the growing Jackson Heights illegal drug trade was described by this excerpt from a 1978 New York magazine article titled \\"Gunfights in the Cocaine Corral\\": By the late 1980s, Jackson Heights had rising real-estate values and a moderate amount of crime compared to other city neighborhoods. Nevertheless, there were still high-profile crimes that reinforced perceptions of the neighborhood as dangerous. In 1990, Julio Rivera, a gay Puerto Rican man, was murdered in a hate crime. His death galvanized the LGBTQ community into protesting his death with a candlelight vigil, the formation of several LGBTQ activist groups, and the foundation of the Queens Pride Parade.The Lavender Line: Coming Out in Queens. Eds. Stephen Petrus and Soraya Ciego-Lemur. LaGuardia and Wagner Archives, LaGuardia Community College/CUNY, 2018. Two years later, journalist Manuel de Dios Unanue was murdered after authoring articles in El Diario La Prensa about the proliferation of Colombian cartels embedded within the business community along Roosevelt Avenue. Seeking to distance themselves from the portrayal of Jackson Heights as a crime-ridden neighborhood, some residents argued that de Dios had been technically murdered in the neighboring Elmhurst, as the restaurant where he was attacked was on the south side of Roosevelt Avenue. Following the reduction of crime in New York City during the late 1990s, the market for illicit substances that fed the Colombian cocaine industry in Jackson Heights eventually decreased, leading to a reduction in the presence of cartels throughout the neighborhood. = Revitalization and 21st century = Community leaders responded to the negative perceptions of Jackson Heights by seeking to have the neighborhood designated as a historic district. In 1988, the Jackson Heights Beautification Group was formed; it organized walking tours as well as beautification activities and commissioned a neighborhood history. Five years later, part of Jackson Heights was made a New York City historic district. The designation, which set architectural guidelines for structures within the designated district, affected both existing buildings and planned new developments within the district. Starting in the 2000s, Jackson Heights has become once again a desirable destination for professionals and middle-class families. Some of these residents moved to Jackson Heights for the unique architecture of its buildings, while others move for its cultural diversity.  Land use  =Historic district= Most of the original neighborhood, comprising the garden city apartment buildings, was made a National Register Historic District and a New York State Historic Register District. The Jackson Heights New York State and National Register Districts range from 93rd Street through 69th Street between Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue. Some property fronting on Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, as well as some \\"cut-outs\\", are not inside the Register Districts. The national historic district called the Jackson Heights Historic District, includes 2,203 contributing buildings, 19 contributing sites, and three contributing objects. Among the landmarked buildings, over 200 original Queensboro Corporation apartment buildings still exist in Jackson Heights.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Almost six hundred buildings in the neighborhood‚Äîa rectangle stretching roughly from 76th to 88th Streets and from Roosevelt Avenue almost up to Northern Boulevard‚Äîwere designated as a New York City Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on October 19, 1993. It comprises large apartment buildings with private communal gardens, as well as many groupings of private homes and many stores on the streets surrounding Roosevelt Avenue.Myers, Steven Lee. \\"Council Votes Historic District In 38-Block Section of Queens\\", The New York Times, January 27, 1994. Accessed August 20, 2009. Unlike the State and National Districts, the local designation comes with aesthetic protections. In addition to the Jackson Heights Historic District, the Lent Homestead and Cemetery and Jackson Heights post office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. = Business district = The main retail thoroughfare is 37th Avenue from 72nd Street to Junction Boulevard, with more retail on 73rd, 74th, and 82nd streets between 37th and Roosevelt avenues.Daniel Maurer \\"Stretching $50 in Jackson Heights.\\" New York Magazine Stores and restaurants on and near 74th Street tend to cater to the large population from the Indian subcontinent in the neighborhood, with sari and jewelry stores, Indian and Bengali music and movie retailers and many restaurants. 37th Avenue contains a wide mix of retailers, including many grocery stores, and 82nd Street contains many national chain stores located in Tudor-style buildings in the Jackson Heights Historic District. South American retailers and eateries, predominantly from Colombia and Peru dominate Northern Boulevard from 80th Street east to the border of neighboring Corona at Junction Boulevard. Roosevelt Avenue is also lined with various mainly Hispanic retail stores.  Street food  Street vendor in Jackson Heights Along Roosevelt Avenue from 74th to 108th Streets, street food from all over the world is made and sold though food carts are \\"currently dominated by the Mexican community.\\"Miyares, Ines M. \\"From Exclusionary Covenant to Ethnic Hyperdiversity in Jackson Heights, Queens.\\" Geographical Review, vol. 94, no. 4, Oct. 2004, pp. 462‚Äì483 Typical cart food includes Bangladeshi fuchka (phuchka), Middle Eastern lamb over rice, Nepalese momo, Colombian chuzos and arepas, Greek souvlaki, Ecuadorian ceviche, Thai steamed chicken over rice, and Mexican elotes (corn on a cob), tacos, homemade tamales filled with meats, cheese, fruits or even chilies, and fruit batidos or aguas frescas (smoothies) as well as South American sweet churros. In a 2017 episode of his show Parts Unknown, American chef Anthony Bourdain visited several Queens eateries, profiling Evelia Coyotzi, who sells tamales in a street cart on Junction Boulevard, the border between Jackson Heights and neighboring Corona. Bourdain learned about Coyotzi, a Mexican immigrant who spoke no English, through the Street Vendor Project, which advocates for New York City street vendors. = Other buildings = Eagle Theater Most housing units in Jackson Heights are apartments in multi-unit buildings, many of which are five or six stories. Many of these buildings are co-ops, some are rentals, and a few are condominiums. There are also a number of one- to three-family houses, most of which are attached row houses. 34th and 35th avenues, as well as most side streets between 37th Avenue and Northern Boulevard, are residential. A section of 90th Street between 30th Avenue and Northern Boulevard was privately developed separately from the Queensboro Corporation. The structures on that stretch of 90th Street are mostly Tudor buildings. There were five historic movie theaters in Jackson Heights, which are all currently either repurposed or closed. The Art Deco Earle Theater, opened in 1936 on 37th Road between 73rd and 74th streets, was a neighborhood movie theater before becoming a porn theater and then, with the name changed to \\"Eagle\\", a Bollywood theater before a strike in the Bollywood industry caused the theater to close permanently in 2009; it is now a food court selling cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. The Fair Theatre, opened in 1939 at Astoria Boulevard and 90th Street, became a porn theater. The Polk Theater, on 37th (formerly Polk) Avenue and 93rd Street, opened in 1938 and closed in 2006, also was a porn theater during its later years, before it was demolished in 2008. The Colony Theater, on 82nd Street north of Roosevelt Avenue, opened in 1935 and closed in 1991. The Jackson, afterwards an Indian-owned theater under the name of the Jackson Heights Cinema, on 82nd Street south of Roosevelt Avenue, was demolished in March 2017. Finally, the Boulevard Theater, on Northern Boulevard and 83rd Street, is now a Latin-American restaurant of the same name.

(Because of its large and vibrant Tibetan community, it has been called \\"the second (if unofficial) capital of the exile Tibetan world, after Dharamsala, India.\\") Most businesses are Asian- and Latino-owned, and there are restaurants, bakeries, specialty shops, legal offices, bars, and beauty salons. There is a Little India on 74th Street and a Little Pakistan and Little Bangladesh on 73rd Street. There is also a large concentration of South Americans east of 77th Street, especially a Little Colombia along 37th Avenue.

Many of the displaced Colombians have moved to adjacent areas such as Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Corona, College Point and Flushing. Queens County still has the largest concentration of Colombians in the United States of any county (roughly 135,000).

That was the beginning of what is now the second largest gay community in New York City.Maly, Michael T. \\"Chapter 4: Jackson Heights.\\" Beyond Segregation: Multiracial and Multiethnic Neighborhoods in the United States, Temple University Press, 2011 Until the 1990s, LGBT activities in Jackson Heights were usually held surreptitiously and at night due to a constant fear of backlash. As the neighborhood continued to grow, more spaces for the gay community were added. One of those was the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, which was created using grant money and is still the only senior center in Queens serving the LGBT community specifically. Murder of Julio Rivera The LGBT community became a movement after the 1990 murder of Julio Rivera, a 29-year-old bartender who worked at the Magic Touch gay bar. Rivera was raised in the Bronx, but tried to avoid the violence of the streets there, and moved to Jackson Heights as an young adult. On the night of July 2, three men cornered Rivera in a schoolyard that was known as a gay cruising area and beat him with a hammer and beer bottle, and then stabbed him. At the beginning of the case, the police department categorized the assault as drug-related, because Rivera had been a longtime cocaine user and they found traces of cocaine on his body. However, after Rivera's friends and relatives advocated for the case to be examined further, the NYPD concluded that Rivera's death had been an anti-gay crime, and the three men involved were charged with murder and manslaughter. Julio Rivera This was the first real standing for justice and honor for the LGBT community in Queens. The resulting activism led to the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, a social services agency that helps monitor any type of criminal acts against the community citywide. Rivera's sister-in-law was elected as the AVP for the LGBT board. Union helped improve the relationship between the Police Department and Jackson Heights' LGBT community and helped with supervision against violence. In 2000, the corner of 78th Street and 37th Avenue, where Rivera was killed, was renamed in his memory\\"Over 40,000 Attend Our Largest Pride Day Events Ever! Queens Pride Guide 2000.

Onam is a major annual event for Malayali people in and outside Kerala. It is a harvest festival, one of three major Hindu celebrations along with Vishu and Thiruvathira, and it is observed with numerous festivities. Onam celebrations include Vallam Kali (boat races), Pulikali (tiger dances), Pookkalam (flower Rangoli), Onathappan (worship), Onam Kali, Tug of War, Thumbi Thullal (women's dance), Kummattikali (mask dance), Onathallu (martial arts), Onavillu (music), Kazhchakkula (plantain offerings), Onapottan (costumes), Atthachamayam (folk songs and dance), and other celebrations. It is the New Year day for Malayalis., Quote: \\"Onam [Malyali Hindu new year] (...)\\" Onam is the official state festival of Kerala with public holidays that start four days from Uthradom (Onam eve). Major festivities take place across 30 venues in Thiruvananthapuram, capital of Kerala. It is also celebrated by Malayali diaspora around the world. Though its origins are often attributed to aspects in Hindu mythology, Onam is celebrated as a cultural festival across all communities in Kerala.Malayali Muslim man celebrates Onam after a preacher calls the festival 'haram', India Today, Shreya Biswas (12 September 2016); Mahabali comes calling, The Hindu, Neeti Sarkar (5 September 2014) Significance Onam is an ancient Hindu, Quote: \\"Onam, Hindu festival in Kerala State, India.\\", Quote: \\"Onam (Hindu festival)\\" festival of Kerala that celebrates rice harvest., Quote: \\"The 2000 Onam (Hindu festival) special edition of...\\" The significance of the festival is in Hindu legends, of which two are more common. =Mahabali legend= According to the Hindu mythology, Mahabali was the great-great-grandson of a Brahmin sage named Kashyapa, the great-grandson of a demonic dictator, Hiranyakashipu, and the grandson of Vishnu devotee Prahlada. This links the festival to the Puranic mythology of Prahlada of Holika fame in Hinduism, who was the son of Hiranyakashipu. Prahlada, despite being born to a demonic Asura father who hated Vishnu, rebelled against his father's persecution of people and worshipped Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu tries to kill his son Prahlada, but is slain by Vishnu in his Narasimha avatar, Prahlada is saved. The dwarf Vamana taking a leap-step is a part of many Hindu temple arts (above), and one legend behind Onam. Prahlada's grandson, Mahabali, came to power by defeating the gods (Devas) and taking over the three worlds. According to Vaishnavism mythology, the defeated Devas approached Vishnu for help in their battle with Mahabali. Vishnu refused to join the gods in violence against Mahabali because Mahabali was a good ruler and his own devotee. Mahabali, after his victory over the gods, declared that he would perform a Yajna (homa sacrifices/rituals) and grant anyone any request during the Yajna. Vishnu took the avatar ‚Äì his fifth ‚Äì of a dwarf monk called Vamana and approached Mahabali. The king offered anything to the boy ‚Äì gold, cows, elephants, villages, food, whatever he wished. The boy said that one must not seek more than one needs, and all he needed was \\"three paces of land.\\" Mahabali agreed. Vamana grew to an enormous size and covered everything Mahabali ruled over in just two paces. For the third pace, Mahabali offered his head for Vishnu to step on, an act that Vishnu accepted as evidence of Mahabali's devotion. Vishnu granted him a boon, by which Mahabali could visit again, once every year, the lands and people he previously ruled. This revisit marks the festival of Onam, as a reminder of the virtuous rule and his humility in keeping his promise before Vishnu. The last day of Mahabali's stay is remembered with a nine-course vegetarian Onasadya feast. The name Thrikkakara is originated from 'Thiru-kaal-kara' meaning 'place of the holy foot'. The main deity at Thrikkakara Temple is Vamana, the smaller temple to the side has Shiva as the deity. Vamana temple is known as 'Vadakkum Devar' and the Shiva temple is known as 'Tekkum Devar'. A number of subsidiary deities have been installed at Thrikkakara Temple. The 1961 census report on Onam festival states : > Though the Vamana temple is accepted as the main temple at the elite level, > the local people consider the Shiva temple as the more important one. They > believe that Shiva was the 'Kuladeivam' (family deity) of Mahabali and that > there was no Vamana temple at that time. The palace of Mahabali was situated > at the place where the Vamana temple is at present. After the fall of > Mahabali, his palace was destroyed and later on Vamana was installed on that > spot by the saint Kapila. According to Nanditha Krishna, a simpler form of this legend, one without Mahabali, is found in the Rigveda and the Vedic text Shatapatha Brahmana where a solar deity is described with powers of Vishnu. This story likely grew over time, and is in part allegorical, where Bali is a metaphor for thanksgiving offering after a bounty of rice harvest during monsoon, and Vishnu is the metaphor of the Kerala sun and summer that precedes the Onam. According to Roshen Dalal, the story of Mahabali is important to Onam in Kerala, but similar Mahabali legends are significant in the region of Balia and Bawan in Uttar Pradesh, Bharuch in Gujarat, and Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra. The story is significant not because Mahabali's rule ended, but it emphasizes the Hindu belief in cyclical nature of events, that no individual, no ruler and nothing lasts forever, except the virtues and self-understanding that overcomes all sorrow. =Parashurama legend= Vamana is worshipped as Onathappan during Onam festival An alternate legend behind Onam relates to Parashurama, an incarnation of Vishnu who is credited in Hindu mythology to have created the Western Ghats from the southern tip of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and up to Maharashtra. According to this legend, Vishnu got upset with the kings and the warrior caste who were constantly at war and were arrogant over others. Vishnu took the avatar of Parashurama, or \\"Rama with an axe\\" and also known as Rama Jamadagyna, in the era of King Kaartavirya. This king persecuted and oppressed the people, the sages and the gods. One day, the king came to the hermitage of Parashurama and his mother Renuka, where while Parashurama was away, the king without permission took away the calf of their cow. When Parashurama returned, he felt the injustice of the king, called him to war, and killed the king and all his oppressive warriors. At the end, he threw the axe, and wherever it fell, the sea retreated, creating the land of Kerala and other coastal western parts of the Indian subcontinent. Another version states that Parashurama brought Namboodiri Brahmins to southwestern parts of India, by creating a mini-Himalaya-like mountain range with his axe. The Onam festival, according to this legend, celebrates Parashurama's creation of Kerala by marking those days as the new year. The legend and worship of Parashurama is attested in texts and epigraphs dated to about the 2nd century CE. =Cultural festival= Onam is a \\"popular major Hindu festival in Kerala\\", states Christine Frost, but one that is also celebrated by Orthodox Christians with \\"much zest alongside Hindus\\". The festival is celebrated in BECs (Basic Ecclesial communities) in Trivandrum with local rituals, according to Latin Catholic Bishop Selvister Ponnumuthan. These traditions, according to Selvister Ponnumuthan, start with the lighting of Nilavilakku, an arati that includes waving of flowers (pushparati) over the Bible, eating the Onam meal together with the Hindus as a form of \\"communion of brothers and sisters of different faiths\\". The significance of these practices are viewed by BECs in Trivandrum as a form of integration with Hindus, mutual respect and sharing a tradition. Paulinus of St. Bartholomew (1748-1806), in his 'A voyage to the East Indies' describes Onam as : > The fourth grand festival, celebrated in Malayala, is called Onam, and > happens always in the month of September, on the day of new moon (not > always). About the 10th of September the rain ceases in Malabar. All nature > seems as if regenerated; the flowers again shoot up, and the trees bloom, in > a word, this season is the same as that which Europeans call spring. This > festival seems, therefore, to have been instituted for the purpose of > soliciting from the Gods a happy and fruitful year. It continues eight days > and during that time the Indians are accustomed to adorn their houses with > flowers and daub them over with cow's dung; because the cow, as already > observed, is a sacred animal dedicated to the Goddess Lakshmi, the Ceres of > the Indians. On this occasion they also put on new clothes throw aside all > their old earthenware and supply its place by new. The men, particularly > those who are young, form themselves into two parties and shoot at each > other with arrows. These arrows are blunted, but exceedingly strong, and are > discharged with such force, that a considerable number are generally wounded > on both sides. These games have a great likeness to the Cerealia and > Juvenalia of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Most Muslims join the festivities in Kerala and celebrate \\"Hindu festivals such as Onam\\"., Quote: \\"Most of the Muslims celebrate Hindu festivals like Onam, Divali etc; actively participating in the Hindu festivals without any religious feelings but as occasions to rejoice with friends\\" Muslim reformists have called on other Muslims to refrain from taking part in the festival. For example, a Kerala-based Salafi preacher has called Onam as haram (wrong and forbidden). In 2019, another Muslim religious speaker caused controversy over his statement that Muslims should not celebrate the festivals of other religions like Onam. Some Muslim Indian politicians light traditional vilakku (oil lamps), while others have refused to light these lamps at Onam events declaring it to be a Hindu tradition and against the teachings of Islam. Muslim daily newspapers and other publications have condemned Muslim ministers who participate in Onam traditions.Sunni outfits slam Muneer, The Times of India (9 September 2016); Kerala salafi preacher says Onam, Christmas haram, The Times of India (18 July 2016) However some Muslims observe Onam anyway, considering its celebrations and rituals as a cultural practice.Malayali Muslim man celebrates Onam after a preacher calls the festival 'haram', India Today, Shreya Biswas (12 September 2016) Mahabali comes calling, The Hindu, Neeti Sarkar (5 September 2014) According to Ritty A. Lukose, Onam is generally considered as a Hindu festival, one that is culturally inclusive within the \\"secular lexicon\\" of Hinduism. In recent years, however, it has undertaken a political tone. In one case, students group affiliated with Hindu nationalism in Kerala objected when a Muslim played the role of Mahabali. While the student group did not attack the Muslim, they targeted and protested against the local organizer when alternate Hindus are available to play that role. According to Lukose, this incident shows how \\"the cultural figure of King Mahabali, understood as Hindu, tolerant and inclusive\\" into an \\"exclusively Hindu one\\".  Celebrations, rituals and practices  Onam falls in the month of Chingam, which is the first month according to the Malayalam Calendar. The celebrations mark the Malayalam New Year, are spread over ten days, and conclude with Thiruvonam. The ten days are sequentially known as Atham, Chithira, Chodhi, Vishakam, Anizham, Thriketa, Moolam, Pooradam, Uthradam and Thiruvonam. The first and the last day are particularly important in Kerala and to Malayalee communities elsewhere. The Atham day is marked with the start of festivities at Vamanamoorthy Thrikkakara temple (Kochi). This Vishnu temple is considered as the focal centre of Onam and the abode of Mahabali, with the raising of the festival flag. Parades are held, which are colourful and depict the elements of Kerala culture with floats and tableaux. Other days have a diverse range of celebrations and activities ranging from boat races, cultural programs, sports competitions, dance events, martial arts, floral Rangoli ‚Äì pookkalam, prayers, shopping, donating time or food for charity to spending time with family over feasts. Men and women wear traditional dress. The Kerala sari or Kasavu sari is particularly wore on this day. = Athachamayam= Onam starts off every year with a parade called Athachamayam. The Onam celebrations across the state starts off with a grand procession at Thrippunithura near Kochi called Atthachamayam, also referred to as Thripunithura Athachamayam. The parade features elephants marching, drum beats and other music, folk art forms, floats and colorfully dressed people with masks.Thripunithura Athachamayam, Kerala Tourism, Government of Kerala In Kerala's history, the Kochi king used to head a grand military procession in full ceremonial robes from his palace to the Thrikkakara temple, meeting and greeting his people. In contemporary times, this a state-supported event. The parade floats traditionally feature scenes from epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Additionally, some floats include themes from the Bible as well as current themes thereby highlighting unity and harmony.Athachamayam: a festival of generations, Athachamayam, Trippunithura Municipality (2015) The procession path historically has been from Tripunithura to the Vamanamoorthy Temple in Thrikkakara, Ernakulam district. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu in his Vamana (dwarf) avatar. After arrival at the temple, the marchers offer a prayer. =Pookkalam (Flower Rangoli)= Floral Rangoli during Onam are a tradition Thrikkakara Appan Onathappan idol (an icon of Vamana avatar) inside Pookalam during Onam The floral Rangoli, known as Onapookkalam or just Pookkalam, is made out of the gathered blossoms with several varieties of flowers of differing tints pinched up into little pieces to design and decorate patterns on the floor, particularly at entrances and temple premises like a flower mat. Lamps are arranged in the middle or edges. It is a work of religious art, typically the team initiative of girls and women, who accomplish it with a delicate touch and a personal artistic sense of tone and blending. When completed, a miniature pandal (umbrella) hung with little festoons is erected over it. The pookkalam is similar to Rangoli which is made of powders of various colors and is popular in North India. The traditional ritual of laying pookkalam (floral Rangoli) starts on Atham day. The pookkalam on this day is called Athapoo, and it is relatively small in size. The size of the pookkalam grows in size progressively with each day of the Onam festival. Only yellow flowers will be used on Atham with only one circular layer made and the design is kept simple. Statues or figurines of Mahabali and Vamana are also installed at the entrance of each house on this day.https://www.timesnownews.com/spiritual/religion/article/onam-pookalam- know-everything-about-its-significance-and-check-out-some-images/645156 Traditionally, Atthapookalams included flowers endemic to Kerala and the Dashapushpam (10-flowers), but nowadays all varieties of flowers are used. Earthen mounds, which look somewhat like square pyramids, representing Mahabali and Vamana are placed in the dung-plastered courtyards in front of the house along with the Pookalam, and beautifully decorated with flowers. All over Kerala, Pookalam competitions are a common sight on Onam day. =Music and dance= Thiruvathira Kali dance during Onam. Traditional dance forms including Thiruvathira, Kummattikali, Pulikali, Thumbi Thullal, Onam Kali and others. Thiruvathira Kali is a women's dance performed in a circle around a lamp. Kummattikali is a colorful-mask dance. In Thrissur, festivities include a procession consisting of caparisoned elephants surrounded by Kummatikali dancers. The masked dancers go from house to house performing the colorful Kummattikali. Onam Kali is a form of dance where players arrange themselves in circles around a pole or tree or lamp, then dance and sing songs derived from the Ramayana and other epics. Kathakali performances are a part of Onam tradition. Kathakali dance is also commonly performed during this time, with dancers enacting famous mythological legends. A famous venue for this is at Valluvanad which is associated with the growth of Kathakali, and Cheruthuruthy, where Kerala Kalamandalam is located. =Pulikali: tiger dance= Pulikali is a dance in tiger costumes. Pulikali, also known as Kaduvakali is a common sight during the Onam season. This dance showcases performers painted like tigers in bright yellow, red and black, who dance to the beats of instruments like Chenda and Thakil. This folk art is mainly performed in the cultural district of Thrissur and thousands pour into the city to be a part of this art.https://english.mathrubhumi.com/features/life- leisure/covid-pandemic-hinders-onam-festivities-thrissur-to-give-pulikali-a- miss-1.5008169 Performances of the ritual worship dance, Theyyam, are given during the Onam season. In this, Mahabali is played by the Onathar. Its variations include characters such as Oneswaran and Onapottan. At the Thrikkakara temple, every day of the festival showcases one or more of these activities including Kathakali, Thiruvathira, Chakyar Koothu, Ottam Thullal, Patakam, Onam songs, and percussion instrument shows. The Onasadya here is grand in scale, and is attended by over ten thousand people from all religions and faiths. Festivities include Puli Kali (masked leopard dance) and traditional dance forms like Kaikotti Kali which are performed in various functions. The official Government celebrations start on this day with heavy illuminations in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode along with fireworks. Most cities in Kerala, such as the political, commercial and cultural capitals, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Thrissur, are lit up with lights and fabulous displays of fireworks. Sumptuous Onam Sadya feasts are prepared. In Thrikkakara temple, a mega-feast is conducted, which is open to the public and is attended by more than twenty thousand people. =Vallamkali: boat race= An Onam boat race The Vallamkali (the snake boat race) is another event that is synonymous with Onam. Well-known races include the Aranmula Uthrattadhi Boat Race and the Nehru Trophy Boat Race. Numerous oarsmen row huge snake- shaped boats. Men and women come from far and near to watch and cheer the snake boat race through the water. This event is particularly featured on the Pampa River, considered sacred and Kerala equivalent of Ganges River. As a tribute to the traditional snake boat race, a similar snake boat race is also held by the Malayali diaspora in Singapore annually during Onam at the Jurong Lake. =Onam Sadya= Sadya is the traditional nine or more course vegetarian meal served on banana leaf. Onam harvest festival is marked with a special feast lunch on last day and includes rice and a sweet at the end. The Onam sadya (feast) is another indispensable part of Thiruvonam, and almost every Keralite attempts to either make or attend one. The Onasadya reflects the spirit of the season and is traditionally made with seasonal vegetables such as yam, cucumber, ash gourd and so on. The feast is served on plantain leaves and consists of nine courses, but may include over two dozen dishes, including (but not limited to): Chips (especially Banana chips), Sharkaraveratti (Fried pieces of banana coated with jaggery), Pappadam, various vegetable and soups such as Injipuli (also called PuliInji), Thoran, Mezhukkupuratti, Kaalan, Olan, Avial, Sambhar, Dal served along with a small quantity of ghee, Erisheri, Molosyam, Rasam, Puliseri (also referred to as Velutha curry), Kichadi (not to be confused with Khichdi) and Pachadi (its sweet variant), Moru (buttermilk or curd mixed with water), Pickles both sweet and sour, and coconut chutney. The feast ends with a series of dessert called Payasam (a sweet dish made of milk, sugar, jaggery, and other traditional Indian savories) eaten either straight or mixed with ripe small plantain. The curries are served with rice, usually the 'Kerala Matta' parboiled rice preferred in Kerala. In hotels and temples, the number of curries and dishes may go up to 30. The importance of the feast to Kerala's Onam celebration culture is captured in the famous Malayalam proverb \\"Kaanam Vittum Onam Unnanam\\" which means \\"One must have the Onam lunch even by selling one's property if need be.\\" The Travancore-style Onasadya is renowned to be the most disciplined and tradition-bound. The Kurichians tribe of Parambikkulam celebrate Onam as a festival for eating new grains. Just before Onam, they go for a community hunt and the games bagged during the hunt are distributed among participants and consumed in family feasts. The feasts are held on Uthradam and Thiruvonam. Their feast also include fish and meat. = Post Onam celebrations = Normally, the largest chunk of Onam celebrations ends by Thiruvonam. However, the two days following Thiruvonam are also celebrated as Third and Fourth Onam. The third Onam, called Avvittom marks the preparations for King Mahabali's return ascension to heavens. The main ritual of the day is to take the Onathappan statue which was placed in the middle of every Pookkalam during the past 10 days and immerse it in nearby rivers or sea. The Pookkalam will be cleaned and removed after this ritual.https://www.news18.com/news/india/onam-2019-as-keralas-annual-harvest- festival-begins-heres-how-it-is-celebrated-for-10-days-2293685.html =Other customs= Onapottan in traditional costume is a custom in northern Kerala. Onapottan visits houses and gives blessings.

Many lamps are lit in Hindu temples of Kerala during this celebration.Genealogy Of The South Indian Deities By Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg, Daniel Jeyaraj. p. 179 A palmyra tree is erected in front of temples and surrounded with a wooden balustrade and covered with dry palmyra leaves. It is lit with a torch and burned to ashes to signify that King Mahabali went to Patala as a sacrifice. The swing is another integral part of Onam, especially in rural areas. Young men and women, decked in their best, sing Onappaatt, or Onam songs, and rock one another on swings slung from high branches. Onam season is often associated with creativity as weavers and potters go for excess production to cater to increased demands for their products during the season, especially in North Kerala regions of Kannur and Kasargod. Handloom fairs are an integral part of the spirit of Onam festivities these days. In some parts of Kerala, people indulge in various games and dances during and post-Thiruvonam. These are known as Onakkalikal. These include competitions such as Ox races (Maramadimatsaram), Uriyady, food- eating competitions, Pookalam competitions etc.in a special month. Kuravans of Travancore use Onam as a day for offering thanks to their ancestral spirits. On Uthradam day, they offer liquor, rice cakes, flattened and parched rice, incense, camphor etc. to the spirits. The ritual ends with a request to the spirits to be satisfied with their offerings, and assured that the next attempt would be better. Then an appeal is made to protect the believers and to ward off evil spirits from their area. This ritual is locally known as kalayam vaikkal. A similar offering like this is done during Makaram harvest, known as Uchara. Outside India Onam is also celebrated by the worldwide Malayali diaspora. Celebrations are notable in the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, United States, and in France (Paris, Marseille) See also * Onathallu or Avittathallu References  External links  * Hindu festivals Folk festivals in India Festivals in Kerala Harvest festivals in India August observances September observances * Religious festivals in India ","title":"Onam"},{"id":"288681","text":"The Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional holiday which occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional Chinese calendar.

History =Superstition= The fifth lunar month is considered an unlucky month. People believed that natural disasters and illnesses are common in the fifth month. In order to get rid of the misfortune, people would put calamus, Artemisia, pomegranate flowers, Chinese ixora and garlic above the doors on the fifth day of the fifth month. Since the shape of calamus forms like a sword and with the strong smell of the garlic, it is believed that they can remove the evil spirits. Hanging wormwood leaves on top of a door to deter insects. Another origin of Dragon Boat Festival: Before the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.), the fifth month of the lunar calendar was regarded as a bad month and the fifth day of the month like a bad day, and known as the Dragon Boat festival nowadays. Poisonous animals will appear starting from this days such as snakes, centipedes, and scorpions as well as that people may get sick easily after this day. Therefore, during the Dragon Boat Festival, people try any way to avoid bad luck. For example, people paste pictures of the five poisonous creatures on the wall and stick needles in them. People also make paper cuttings of the five creatures and wrapped these around the wrists of their children. Big ceremonies and performances developed from these practices in many areas, making the Dragon Boat Festival a day for getting rid of disease and bad luck.A statue of alt= Decorating doors by hanging wormwood and calamus plants is an important ritual of the Dragon Boat Festival. People believe that doing so will drive evil spirits and diseases away. =Qu Yuan= The story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister Qu Yuan (‚Äì278 BC) of the ancient state of Chu during the Warring States period of the Zhou Dynasty.SCMP.\\" Earthquake and floods make for the muted festival. Retrieved on 9 June 2008. A cadet member of the Chu royal house, Qu served in high offices. However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of Qin, Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason. During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of poetry. Twenty-eight years later, Qin captured Ying, the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan died by suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River. It is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of dragon boat races. When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of sticky rice into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This is said to be the origin of zongzi. During World War II, Qu Yuan began to be treated in a nationalist way as \\"China's first patriotic poet\\". The view of Qu's social idealism and unbending patriotism became canonical under the People's Republic of China after 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. =Wu Zixu= Despite the modern popularity of the Qu Yuan origin theory, in the former territory of the Kingdom of Wu, the festival commemorated Wu Zixu (died 484 BC), the Premier of Wu. Xi Shi, a beautiful woman sent by King Goujian of the state of Yue, was much loved by King Fuchai of Wu. Wu Zixu, seeing the dangerous plot of Goujian, warned Fuchai, who became angry at this remark. Wu Zixu was forced to commit suicide by Fuchai, with his body thrown into the river on the fifth day of the fifth month. After his death, in places such as Suzhou, Wu Zixu is remembered during the Dragon Boat Festival. =Cao E= The front of the Cao E Temple, facing east, toward Cao'e River, in Shangyu, Zhejiang, China. Although Wu Zixu is commemorated in southeast Jiangsu and Qu Yuan elsewhere in China, much of Northeastern Zhejiang including the cities of Shaoxing, Ningbo and Zhoushan celebrates the memory of the young girl Cao E (, AD 130‚Äì144) instead. Cao E's father Cao Xu () was a shaman who presided over local ceremonies at Shangyu. In 143, while presiding over a ceremony commemorating Wu Zixu during the Dragon Boat Festival, Cao Xu accidentally fell into the Shun River. Cao E, in an act of filial piety, decided to find her father in the river, searching for 3 days trying to find him. After five days, she and her father were both found dead in the river from drowning. Eight years later, in 151, a temple was built in Shangyu dedicated to the memory of Cao E and her sacrifice for filial piety. The Shun River was renamed Cao'e River in her honor.Dragon Boat Races at Dajia River Park in Taipei. =Pre-existing holiday= Some modern research suggests that the stories of Qu Yuan or Wu Zixu were superimposed onto a pre-existing holiday tradition. The promotion of these stories might be encouraged by Confucian scholars, seeking to legitimize and strengthen their influence in China. The relationship between zongzi, Qu Yuan and the festival, first appeared during the early Han dynasty. The stories of both Qu Yuan and Wu Zixu were recorded in Sima Qian's Shiji, completed 187 and 393 years after the events, respectively, because historians wanted to praise both characters. Another theory, advanced by Wen Yiduo, is that the Dragon Boat Festival originated from dragon worship. Support is drawn from two key traditions of the festival: the tradition of dragon boat racing and zongzi. The food may have originally represented an offering to the dragon king, while dragon boat racing naturally reflects a reverence for the dragon and the active yang energy associated with it. This was merged with the tradition of visiting friends and family on boats. Another suggestion is that the festival celebrates a widespread feature of east Asian agrarian societies: the harvest of winter wheat. Offerings were regularly made to deities and spirits at such times: in the ancient Yue, dragon kings; in the ancient Chu, Qu Yuan; in the ancient Wu, Wu Zixu (as a river god); in ancient Korea, mountain gods (see Dano). As interactions between different regions increased, these similar festivals eventually merged into one holiday. =Early 20th Century= In the early 20th Century the Dragon Boat Festival was observed from the first to the fifth days of the fifth month, and also known as the Festival of Five Poisonous Insects (). Yu Der Ling writes in chapter 11 of her 1911 memoir \\"Two Years in the Forbidden City\\": > The first day of the fifth moon was a busy day for us all, as from the first > to the fifth of the fifth moon was the festival of five poisonous insects, > which I will explain later‚Äîalso called the Dragon Boat Festival. [...] Now > about this Feast. It is also called the Dragon Boat Feast.

China Internet Information Center. Retrieved on 12 June 2013. =Dragon boat racing= Dragon boat racing has a rich history of ancient ceremonial and ritualistic traditions, which originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago. The legend starts with the story of Qu Yuan, who was a minister in one of the Warring State governments, Chu. He was slandered by jealous government officials and banished by the king. Out of disappointment in the Chu monarch, he drowned himself into the Miluo River. The common people rushed to the water and tried to recover his body. In commemoration of Qu Yuan, people hold dragon boat races yearly on the day of his death according to the legend. They also scattered rice into the water to feed the fish, to prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body, which is one of the origins of zongzi. Red Bean Rice Dumpling =Zongzi (Traditional Chinese Rice Dumpling)= A notable part of celebrating Dragon Boat Festival is making and eating zongzi with family members and friends. People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, bamboo, forming a pyramid shape. The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, jujube, and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage, and salted duck eggs. The reason why the Chinese eat zongzi on this special day has many statements. The folk version is to hold a memorial ceremony for Quyuan. While in fact, Zongzi has been regarded as an oblation for the ancestor even before the Chunqiu period. From the Jin dynasty, Zongzi officially became the festival food and long last until now. =Food related to 5= 'Wu' (Âçà) in the name 'Duanwu' in Chinese has a similar pronunciation as the number 5 in multiple dialects, and thus many regions have traditions of eating food that is related to the number 5. For example, the Guangdong and Hong Kong regions have the tradition of having congee made from 5 different beans. =Realgar wine= Realgar wine or Xiong Huang wine is a Chinese alcoholic drink that is made from Chinese yellow wine dosed with powdered realgar, a yellow-orange arsenic sulfide mineral also known as \\"rice wine\\". It is often used as a pesticide against mosquitoes and other biting insects during the hot summers, and as a common antidote against poison in ancient Asia. =5-colored silk- threaded braid= In some regions of China, parents braid silk threads of 5 colors and put them on their children's wrists, on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival. People believe that this will help keep bad spirits and diseases away. Other common activities include hanging up icons of Zhong Kui (a mythic guardian figure), hanging mugwort and calamus, taking long walks, and wearing perfumed medicine bags. Other traditional activities include a game of making an egg stand at noon (this \\"game\\" implies that if someone succeeds in making the egg stand at exactly 12:00 noon, that person will receive luck for the next year), and writing spells. All of these activities, together with the drinking of realgar wine or water, were regarded by the ancients and some today as effective in preventing disease or evil while promoting health and well-being. In the early years of the Republic of China, Duanwu was celebrated as the \\"Poets' Day\\" due to Qu Yuan's status as China's first known poet. The Taiwanese also sometimes conflate the spring practice of egg-balancing with Duanwu.Huang, Ottavia. Hmmm, This Is What I Think: \\"Dragon Boat Festival: Time to Balance an Egg\\". 24 June 2012.

The sun, like the Chinese dragon, traditionally represents masculine energy, whereas the moon, like the phoenix, traditionally represents feminine energy. The summer solstice is considered the annual peak of male energy while the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, represents the annual peak of feminine energy. The masculine image of the dragon has thus associated with the Dragon Boat Festival.Chan, Arlene & al. Paddles Up! Dragon Boat Racing in Canada, p. 27. Dundurn Press Ltd., 2009. .

Astoria is bounded by the East River and is adjacent to three other Queens neighborhoods: Long Island City to the southwest, Sunnyside to the southeast, and Woodside to the east. , Astoria has an estimated population of 95,446. The area was originally called Hallet's (or Hallett's) Cove after its first landowner William Hallet, who settled there in 1652 with his wife, Elizabeth Fones. Hallet's Cove was incorporated on April 12, 1839, and was later renamed for John Jacob Astor, then the wealthiest man in the United States, in order to persuade him to invest in the area. During the second half of the 19th century, economic and commercial growth brought increased immigration. Astoria and several other surrounding villages were incorporated into Long Island City in 1870, which in turn was incorporated into the City of Greater New York in 1898.

Astoria is located in Queens Community District 1 and its ZIP Codes are 11101, 11102, 11103, 11105, and 11106. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 114th Precinct. Politically, Astoria is represented by the New York City Council's 22nd and 26th Districts.\\"Current City Council Districts for Queens County\\", New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History = Early settlement = The area now known as Astoria was originally called Hallet's Cove (also spelled Hallett's Cove), after its first landowner William Hallet, (or Hallett) who settled there in 1652 with his wife, Elizabeth Fones. The peninsula was bordered to the north by Hell Gate, to the west by the East River, and the south by Sunswick Creek. Hallet bought the land in 1664 from two native chiefs named Shawestcont and Erramorhar. Beginning in the early 19th century, affluent New Yorkers constructed large residences around 12th and 14th streets, an area that later became known as Astoria Village (now Old Astoria). Hallet's Cove, incorporated on April 12, 1839http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/arch_reports/952.pdf and previously founded by fur merchant Stephen A. Halsey, was a noted recreational destination and resort for Manhattan's wealthy. The area was renamed for John Jacob Astor, then the wealthiest man in the United States with a net worth of more than $40 million, in order to persuade him to invest in the neighborhood. He only invested $500, but the name stayed nonetheless, as a bitter battle over naming the village finally was won by Astor's supporters and friends. From Astor's summer home in Yorkville, Manhattan‚Äîon what is now East 87th Street near York Avenue‚Äîhe could see across the East River the new Long Island village named in his honor. Astor, however, never actually set foot in Astoria. = Economic development = During the second half of the 19th century, economic and commercial growth brought increased immigration from German settlers, mostly furniture and cabinet makers. One such settler was Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg, patriarch of the Steinway family who founded the piano company Steinway & Sons in 1853, which today is a worldwide piano company. Later on, the Steinways built a sawmill and foundry, as well as a streetcar line. The family eventually established Steinway Village for their workers, a company town that provided school instruction in German as well as English. Part of the motivation for locating the Steinway factory in Queens was to keep the workers isolated from the ferment of labor organizing and radicalism occurring in other parts of New York, notably the Lower East Side. View of Astoria from the Triborough Bridge Astoria and several other surrounding villages, including Steinway, were incorporated into Long Island City in 1870. Long Island City remained an independent municipality until it was incorporated into the City of Greater New York in 1898. The area's farms were turned into housing tracts and street grids to accommodate the growing number of residents. Astoria also figured prominently in early American filmmaking as one of its initial centers. That heritage is preserved today by the Museum of the Moving Image and Kaufman Astoria Studios. Demographics 30th Avenue at 36th Street 31st Avenue at 33rd Street For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Astoria as part of three neighborhood tabulation areas: Steinway (north of Grand Central Parkway), Old Astoria (north of 31st Avenue and approximately west of 31st Street), and Astoria (in the remaining area approximately north of Northern Boulevard / 36th Avenue and approximately west of Hobart Street / 50th Street).

The Astoria and Old Astoria tabulation areas had greater Hispanic / Latino and Asian populations, and the Old Astoria area specifically had a greater Black population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The racial composition of Astoria changed significantly from 2000 to 2010. The most significant changes were the decrease in the Other population by 64% (8,919) and the decrease in the Hispanic / Latino population by 13% (5,705). The White majority also decreased by 2% (1,699), while the Asian minority decreased by 5% (1,120), and the change in the small Black population rounded to 0% (11). Taking into account the three census tabulation areas, the White and Asian populations both actually increased in Old Astoria, but decreased enough in Astoria and Steinway to cause an overall decrease; on the other hand, the Black population decreased in Old Astoria and increased equivalently in the other regions. The decreases in the Hispanic / Latino population and the population of all other races, however, were relatively even across the three areas. The entirety of Queens Community District 1, which includes Astoria and parts of Long Island City, is bounded to the east approximately by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and 81st Street, and to the south approximately by Queens Plaza and Northern Boulevard. It had 199,969 residents according to NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 83.4 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 16% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, 41% between 25‚Äì44, and 22% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 12% respectively. , the median household income in Community District 1 was $67,444. In 2018, an estimated 18% of Astoria residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. Around 8% of residents were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 47% in Astoria, slightly lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 1 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010. =Ethnic groups=  Early populations  Astoria was first settled by the Dutch, English, and Germans in the 17th century. Many Irish settled in the area during the waves of Irish immigration into New York City during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Italians were the next significant immigrants in Astoria, and numerous Italian restaurants, delis, bakeries, and pizza shops are found throughout Astoria, particularly in the Ditmars Boulevard area. Jews were also a significant ethnic and religious group. The Astoria Center of Israel, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1925 after outgrowing the former Congregation Mishkan Israel, which was built in 1904.  Later populations  The 1960s saw a large increase of Greek population from mainland Greece, and after 1974, there was an influx of Greeks from Cyprus. This cultural imprint can be seen in the numerous Greek restaurants, bakeries, tavernas, and cafes, as well as several Greek Orthodox churches. While the population of Greeks in Astoria was 22,579 in 1980, it dropped to 18,127 by 1990 due to decreased immigration and lower birth rates. Greek organizations in the area include the Hellenic American Action Committee (HANAC) and the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater New York. Recent economic issues in Greece have seen a resurgence of Greek immigration. About 20,000 Maltese also live in Astoria, and although this population has steadily been emigrating from the area, there are still many Maltese, supported by the Maltese Center of New York. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the neighborhood's Muslim population grew from earlier immigrants from Lebanon to also include people from Kosovo, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria. In the 1990s, Steinway Street between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard saw the establishment of many Arabic shops, restaurants, and cafes, which is unofficially called \\"Little Egypt\\", due to the number of Arabs residing there and the mostly Egyptian shops and lounges there. Croatians from Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina have been numerous since the 1960s and their numbers continue to grow. New populations of South American and Balkan peoples have seen significant growth since the early 1990s, including a large population of Brazilians, who reside in the 36th Avenue area. Albanians, Bulgarians, Serbs, and Bosnians have also shown a rise in numbers. Many Spanish Americans live in Astoria, with most of them being of Galician heritage from Northwestern Spain; this community is supported by the Casa Galicia (Galicia House) and the Circulo Espa√±ol (Spanish Circle). At one time, many Bangladeshi Americans settled in Astoria, but by 2001, many of them had moved to Metro Detroit. A survey of an Astoria-area Bengali language newspaper estimated that, in an 18-month period until March 2001, 8,000 Bangladeshi people moved to the Detroit area. However, as of 2010, the Bangladeshi American community in Astoria has been increasing.Kershaw, Sarah. \\"Queens to Detroit: A Bangladeshi Passage.\\" The New York Times. March 8, 2001. Retrieved on February 28, 2012. By the early 21st century, Astoria was one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Queens, with people from around 100 countries residing there . Population losses in Queens were particularly high in immigrant neighborhoods such as Astoria, which suffered the greatest population loss in the city, losing more than 10,000 residents between the years 2000 and 2010. Geography Detail of 1896 map of Long Island City, showing Astoria and Ravenswood, from the Greater Astoria Historical Society. There is some debate as to what constitutes the geographic boundaries of Astoria. The neighborhood was part of Long Island City prior to the latter's incorporation into the City of Greater New York in 1898. The area south of Astoria was called Ravenswood, and traditionally, Broadway was considered the border between the two. Today, however, many residents and businesses south of Broadway identify themselves as Astorians for convenience or status, since Long Island City has historically been considered an industrial area, and Ravenswood is now mostly a low-income neighborhood. Some of the thoroughfares have lent their names to unofficial terms for the areas they serve. For instance, the eastern end of Astoria, with Steinway Street as its main thoroughfare, is sometimes referred to simply as \\"Steinway\\", and the northern end around Ditmars Boulevard is sometimes referred to as \\"Ditmars\\", with their convergence point bearing the neighborhood name \\"Ditmars-Steinway\\". Banners displayed on lamp posts along 30th Avenue refer to it as \\"the Heart of Astoria\\".O'Donnell, Michelle. \\"Life Limps On for Powerless in the Heart of Astoria\\", The New York Times, July 23, 2006. Accessed January 30, 2008. \\"Gary Lyons shook his head. He pointed to welcome banners that had been affixed to lampposts. ‚ÄúSee the flag?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThe heart of Astoria,‚Äù it reads, ‚ÄúWelcome to 30th Avenue.‚Äù\\" =Ravenswood= Ravenswood is the name for the strip of land bordering the East River and Long Island City, and is part of Astoria.Forgotten New York: Ravenswood It was situated around Sunswick Creek, which drained into the East River at the current location of Socrates Sculpture Park. The land was acquired in 1814 by Col. George Gibbs, a businessman from New York City who developed it. Gibbs died in 1833, and the land was divided into nine parcels by three developers. From 1848, there were several mansions built on this land, but the high class housing did not survive. The spring of 1853 brought the opening of a post office of its own and country store \\"run by Messrs. Moore & Luyster, and Mr. Samuel H. Moore of that firm received the appointment of postmaster, handling the mails in a corner of the store.\\" Ravenswood, unlike Astoria, never became a village; there was no disposition at any time to become independent as there was insufficient population or commercial activity to justify such a move. Ravenswood remained an exclusive hamlet within the Town of Newtown until its absorption with the Village of Astoria and the hamlets of Hunters Point, Blissville, Sunnyside, Dutch Kills, Steinway, Bowery Bay and Middleton in Newtown Township into Long Island City in 1870.*Neighborhoods: Ravenswood from the Greater Astoria Historical Society In 1870, Ravenswood, along with several other hamlets and the Village of Astoria, merged to form Long Island City. In 1875, the first commercial buildings were erected, and the mansions were converted into offices and boarding houses. In 1879, the Long Island Terra Cotta Company was established in Ravenswood, by Rudolph Franke. By 1900, Ravenswood was heavily commercial, and remains so to this day. However, the name has retained its residential character through the New York City Housing Authority project that was built in 1949 to 1951 with this name between 34th and 36th Avenues, and 12th and 24th Streets. The name also identifies the large electric power station established along the shore of the East River, just south of the Roosevelt Island Bridge. The Ravenswood Generating Station which includes Ravenswood No. 3 or \\"Big Allis\\", was built by Con Edison in 1963-65 but, due to deregulation, has subsequently been owned by KeySpan, National Grid, and TransCanada. The power plant can generate approximately 2,500 megawatts of power, which is about 20 percent of New York City's electricity demand. =Ditmars= A street in Ditmars (2012) Ditmars is a middle class section of Astoria bounded by Bowery Bay to the north, 31st Street and the Steinway subsection to the east, 23rd Avenue to the south, and the East River to the west. The adjacent Steinway neighborhood was largely developed as a company town by the Steinway & Sons piano company, and included houses and public facilities that were also available to non- employees.Jackson, Kenneth T., The Encyclopedia of New York City, Yale University Press, 1995, p. 335. However, the Ditmars neighborhood was not included in the Steinway & Sons company housing and related facilities project. The neighborhood takes its name from Ditmars Boulevard which was named in honor of Raymond Lee Ditmars, (1876‚Äì1942) famed American herpetologist and curator of Reptiles of the New York Zoological Society at the Bronx Zoo.Neighborhood Gudies. http://www.nestseekers.com/Guides/Neighborhood/Ditmars-Steinway. June 29, 2010. =Astoria Heights= Astoria Heights, or Upper Ditmars, is bounded by Hazen Street to the west, La Guardia Airport to the east, Bowery Bay to the north, and Astoria Boulevard and the Grand Central Parkway to the south. It is mostly a quiet middle class neighborhood of one- and two-family private homes. The Riker-Lent Homestead is near the north end of Astoria Heights at 78-03 19th Road. Built around 1655 by Abraham Riker under a patent from Nieuw Nederland's last governor, Peter Stuyvesant, it is believed to be the oldest remaining dwelling in New York City still used as a residence.The Lent-Riker- Smith Homestead: History, accessed December 25, 2006. \\"The facts confirm that this dwelling is the oldest dwelling in New York City that is still a dwelling.\\" There is an adjacent family cemetery. The Smiths, who bought the house in 1975, have been restoring it for many years. The annual public tour was given usually in mid-September by the owners for the benefit of a local historical society, but has since ceased to occur.In 2008 the tour benefited the Greater Astoria Historical Society. Before Prohibition, there were dance halls, picnic areas, and amusement park rides at North Beach. Ragtime composer Scott Joplin is buried across the Grand Central Parkway at St. Michael's Cemetery, which occasionally holds ragtime concerts. The Rikers Island Bridge to New York City's main prison, Rikers Island, runs from the north end of Hazen Street. Technically, Rikers Island is in the Bronx since New York City took it over from Long Island City in 1884, after it had annexed the South Bronx but before it consolidated Queens. However, like Astoria Heights, Rikers Island gets its mail from the East Elmhurst (ZIP Code 11370) station of the Flushing Post Office.

It is believed to be the oldest surviving martial art in India. It is also considered to be among the oldest martial arts still in existence, with its origin in the martial arts timeline dating back to at least the 3rd century BCE. Kalaripayattu is also mentioned in the Vadakkan Pattukal ballads written about the Chekavar from the Malabar region of Kerala. The author Arnaud Van Der Veere confers the origin of martial arts to India (the roots of which are thought to be in Kalaripayattu), to which he refers to Kalaripayattu as \\"The Mother of All Martial Arts\\". Kalaripayattu is a martial art designed for the ancient battlefield (the word \\"Kalari\\" meaning \\"battlefield\\"), with weapons and combative techniques that are unique to India. Like most other Indian martial arts, Kalaripayattu draws heavily from Hinduism, and is based on Hindu medicinal concepts found in Ayurveda. Practitioners of Kalaripayattu possess intricate knowledge of pressure points on the human body and healing techniques that incorporate the knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga. Students are taught the martial art as a way of life, with a sense of compassion, discipline, and respect toward the master, fellow- students, parents and the community. Particular emphasis is placed on avoiding confrontational situations and using the martial art only as a means of protection, when no other alternative is available. Unlike other parts of India, warriors in Kerala belonged to all castes. Women in Keralite society also underwent training in Kalaripayattu, and still do so to this day. Keralite women such as Unniyarcha are mentioned in a collection of ballads from Kerala called the Vadakkan Pattukal, and are praised for their martial prowess. In 2017, Sri Meenakshi Amma, a 73 year old gurukkal from Vadakara, was awarded the Padma Sri by the Government of India for her contributions to the preservation of Kalaripayattu.https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-37038134/the-sword- fighting-granny-showing-the-young-how-it-s- donehttps://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/meenakshi-amma-the- grand-old-dame-of-kalaripayattu/article25307782.ece  Styles  There are two major styles that are generally acknowledged within traditional Kalaripayattu.

Other smaller, regional styles are also said to exist in isolated regions of Kerala, but these styles are becoming increasingly rare, and difficult to find.

The word Kalari is also found in Sangam literature. The Akananuru and Purananuru describe the use of spears, swords, shields, bows and silambam in the Sangam era. The word kalari also appears in the Puram (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and Akam (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word kalari tatt denoted a martial feat, while kalari kozhai meant a coward in war. Each warrior in the Sangam era received regular military trainingSubramanian, N. (1966). Sangam polity. Bombay: Asian Publishing House. (Wayback Machine PDF) in target practice, horse and elephant riding. In that period and during later periods, the word used for military and military service was chevam. The warriors or soldiers in military service were called Chekavar. They specialized in one or more of the important weapons of the period including the spear (vel), sword (val), shield (kedaham), and bow and arrow (vil ambu). The combat techniques of the Sangam period were the earliest precursors to Kalaripayattu.Zarrilli, Phillip B. A South Indian Martial art and the Yoga and Ayurvedic Paradigms. University of Exeter. References to \\"Silappadikkaram\\" in Sangam literature date back to the 2nd century. This referred to the silambam staff which was in great demand with foreign visitors.Other sources state that the word Kalari is derived from first three letters of Sri Vidhya Mantra.https://archive.org/details/ahandbookonkalaipayattuorg Elements from the yoga tradition as well as finger movements in the nata dances, were incorporated into the fighting arts.J. R. Svinth (2002). A Chronological History of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports. Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences. A number of South Asian fighting styles remain closely connected to yoga, dance and performing arts. Some of the choreographed sparring in Kalaripayattu can be applied to dance and Kathakali dancers who knew Kalaripayattu were believed to be markedly better than other performers. Until recently, only martial artists performed the Chhau dance. Some traditional Indian classical dance schools still incorporate martial arts as part of their exercise regimen.Luijendijk, D.H. (2008) Kalarippayat: The Essence and Structure of an Indian Martial Art, Oprat, Kalaripayattu includes strikes, kicks, grappling, preset forms, weaponry and healing methods. Regional variants are classified according to geographical location in Kerala; these are the Northern style from the Malabar region in northern Kerala, and the Southern style from southern Kerala. Northern Kalaripayattu, or \\"Vadakkan Kalari\\" is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions, jumps and weapons training, while the southern \\"Thekkan Kalari\\" style specializes in hard, impact based techniques with priority on hand-to-hand combat and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts. Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor, as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor. Some of the methods used to enhance flexibility in Kalaripayattu are also utilized in Keralite dance forms such as Kathakali. Dancers in Kerala who had experience with Kalaripayattu were noted to be markedly better than the other performers. Some traditional Indian dance schools still incorporate Kalaripayattu as part of their training regimen.  Techniques and teaching frame Ritualistic ceremony by which a Guru welcomes a new child to the Kalari on VidyƒÅra·πÉbha·πÉ. Kalari Poothara Pooja is a ritual performed in every kalari during the Navaratri festival to honour the Hindu deity Shiva. Traditions and methods of teaching of Kalaripayattu varied between different regions of Kerala. Kalaripayattu is taught in a specialized training ground known as a Kalari. Each kalari is built in accordance to Hindu architectural treatises such as the Vastu Shastras and Shilpa Shastras, along with various religious traditions and customs native to Kerala. The presiding deity of Kalaripayattu is said to be Shiva as well as Bhadrakali. Before every training session in the Kalari, salutations are provides to the presiding deities in the form of a mantra, or prayer. Kalari Salutation Mantra : \\"‡¥∏‡µº‡¥µ‡µç‡¥µ ‡¥§‡¥®‡µç‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥∏‡¥µ‡¥∞‡µÇ‡¥™‡¥æ‡¥Ø ‡¥∏‡µº‡¥µ‡µç‡¥µ ‡¥§‡¥®‡µç‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥∏‡¥µ‡¥∞‡µÇ‡¥™‡¥ø‡¥£‡¥ø ‡¥∏‡µº‡¥µ‡µç‡¥µ‡¥ó‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥∏‡¥Æ‡¥∏‡µç‡¥•‡¥æ‡¥Ø ‡¥∂‡¥ø‡¥µ‡¥æ‡¥Ø ‡¥ó‡µÅ‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥µ ‡¥®‡¥Æ‡¥É‚Äù English Transliteration: Sarva Thantra Swaroopaya Sarva Thantra Swaroopini Sarvagaya Samasthaya Shivaya Guruve Namath Historically, all Keralites of the Hindu community, men and women alike, would undergo mandatory training in Kalaripayattu beginning at the age of 7 or 9 and lasting until the end of their education. Warriors, soldiers and others who wanted to pursue a martial career would continue their training for the rest of their lives. Generally, two styles of Kalaripayattu are acknowledged among Kalari practitioners: the Northern Style and the Southern Style. These two systems are quite similar, but their training methods begin to diverge to specialize in either weapons or hand-to-hand combat. The styles are variations that various masters have adapted and modified according to their understanding of the art. Development and mastery of Kalaripayattu comes from the tradition of constantly learning, adapting and improving the techniques by observing what techniques are practical and effective. There is a great amount of respect and observation of tradition which allows the preservation of the art. The knowledge and experience gained by the practitioners is improved upon by subsequent masters who utilize keen observation, research of various techniques and variations to update the knowledge. The adaptability of Kalaripayattu is largely due to Kalaripayattu being designed for use in warfare and combat. A Kalari practitioner might encounter new fighting techniques from an enemy combatant. The Kalari practitioner would need to learn how to anticipate, adapt to and neutralize these new techniques. This is especially seen in the Southern style of Kalaripayattu, which is believed to have been adapted and modified during wars with Tamil kingdoms to counter martial arts like Silambam, which was one of the main martial art forms practiced by Tamil soldiers at the time. Kalaripayattu is ultimately taught not just as a martial art, but as a way of life that epitomizes respect, compassion and duty over all else. = Northern style = The Northern style is also known as, Vadakkan Kalari, and is generally regarded as the \\"original,\\" form of Kalaripayattu. This system places more emphasis on physical flexibility exercises and strength training rooted on the slogan Meyy kanavanam, meaning, \\"make the body an eye.\\" These exercises are done individually, as well as in combinations. After that meypayattu (a concept similar to kata in Karate) is taught. These are a combination of flexibility exercises with offensive and defensive techniques, however, the actual techniques are taught very much later. Traditionally, the number of meypayattu may differ as per the teaching methods of the Guru. After the student learns meypayattu, stick fighting is taught. Generally, the majority of the Kalaris (schools that teach Kalaripayattu) start training with weapons within 3 to 6 months. Some Kalaris only allow one weapon to be learned per year. After long stick and small stick fighting, iron weapons are introduced. Training begins with the dagger, sword and then the spear. Not all modern schools use specialized weapons. Traditionally, bows and arrows were commonly used in Kerala and students were trained in these techniques, but is rarely taught today. Kalaripayattu has three forms, which are distinguished by their attacking and defensive patterns. They are Arappa Kayy, Pilla Thangi, and Vatten Thiripp. = Southern style = The Southern style is also known as Thekkan Kalari. The origin of Thekkan Kalari is a subject of much debate and controversy. It is a style of Kalaripayattu that is said to have been altered and influenced by Sage Agastya. It may have been altered from the Northern style of Kalaripayattu to fight combatants trained in Adi Murai and Silambam from Tamil Nadu during various wars and skirmishes with Tamil kingdoms. It is essentially a style which combines Kalaripayattu with certain elements of Adi Murai and Silambam. Other sources suggest that martial arts such as Varma Kalai and Adi Thadi may also have influenced the Southern style. While the Southern style is less commonly practiced in Kerala compared to the Northern style, it is revered in Kerala as a combination of the teachings of both Parashurama and Agastya. It is predominantly practiced in some regions of the southern parts of Kerala, particularly in areas near Kanyakumari. While many of the exercises of the Southern style are identical to the Northern Style, it places heavy emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and hard impact techniques, and places less emphasis on weapons and combinations. It starts with the training in Chuvadus: a system of various combinations of fighting techniques similar to Muay Thai and shadow boxing. Immediately after that, sparring with a partner is introduced as part of the training. These pre-determined techniques are repeatedly trained. After a basic proficiency in unarmed combat is established, weapons training begins with a small stick. Small stick training is usually done with two combatants, armed with a stick or dagger. These are primarily defensive techniques. Fighting techniques with two combatants having the same weapons include sparring with long stick, sword, etc. During the duration of this training, the refining of un-armed combat also progresses. As the student gains more experience, a small amount of knowledge pertaining to the Marma points (pressure points) is also taught to the student if deemed appropriate by the Gurukkal. Kalaripayattu techniques are a combination of steps (Chuvadu) and postures (Vadivu). Chuvadu literally means 'steps', the basic steps of the martial arts. Vadivu literally means 'postures' or stances which are the foundations of Kalaripayattu training. They are named after animals, and are usually presented in eight forms. Styles differ considerably from one tradition to another. Not only do the names of poses differ, but their utilization and interpretation vary depending on the Gurukkal's preference, and the traditions of the Kalari. Each stance has its own style, combination, and function. These techniques vary from one style to another.Kalaripayattu Demonstration 222x222px Kalaripayattu Training Stances  Marmashastram and massage  Chavittithirumal/massage It is claimed that experienced Kalari warriors could disable or kill their opponents by merely striking the correct marmam (vital point) on their opponent's body. This technique is taught only to the most promising and level-headed students so as to discourage misuse of the technique. Marmashastram stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (marmachikitsa). This system of marma treatment originated from Ayurveda, as well as Siddha medicine. Critics of Kalaripayattu have pointed out that the application of marmam techniques against neutral outsiders has not always produced verifiable results. The earliest mention of marmam is found in the Rig Veda, where Indra is said to have defeated Vritra by attacking his marmam with a vajra.Mariana Fedorova (1990). Die Marmantheorie in der klassischen indischen Medizin. References to marmam are also found in the Atharva Veda.Subhash Ranade (1993). Natural Healing Through Ayurveda (p. 161). Passage Press. Utah USA. With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that India's early martial artists knew about and practiced attacking or defending vital points. Sushruta (c. 6th century BC) identified and defined 107 vital points of the human body in his Sushruta Samhita.G. D. Singhal, L. V. Guru (1973). Anatomical and Obstetrical Considerations in Ancient Indian Surgery Based on Sarira-Sthana of Susruta Samhita. Of these 107 points, 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick. Sushruta's work formed the basis of the medical discipline Ayurveda, which was taught alongside various Indian martial arts that had an emphasis on vital points, such as Varma kalai and Marma adi. As a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial artists became knowledgeable in the fields of traditional medicine and massage. Kalaripayattu teachers often provide massages (uzhichil) with medicinal oils to their students in order to increase their physical flexibility or to treat muscle injuries encountered during practice. Such massages are generally termed thirumal and the unique massage given to increase flexibility is known as katcha thirumal. It is said to be as sophisticated as the uzhichil treatment of Ayurveda. Kalaripayattu has borrowed extensively from Ayurveda and equally lends to it.

These dolls, though typically red and depicting a bearded man (Bodhidharma), vary greatly in color and design depending on region and artist. Though considered a toy by some, Daruma has a design that is rich in symbolism and is regarded more as a talisman of good luck to the Japanese. Daruma dolls are seen as a symbol of perseverance and good luck, making them a popular gift of encouragement. The doll has also been commercialized by many Buddhist temples to use alongside the setting of goals. Use When purchased, the figure's eyes are both blank white. A user will then select a goal or wish and paint in the left eye of the figure's two eyes. Once the desired goal is achieved, the right eye is filled in. Bodhidharma Bodhidharma, woodblock print by Yoshitoshi, 1887 Bodhidharma was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th/6th century AD. He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Ch'an (Zen) to China. Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend. According to one tradition, Bodhidharma gained a reputation for, among other things, his practice of wall-gazing. Legend claims that he sat facing a wall in meditation for a period of nine years without moving, which caused his legs and arms to fall off from atrophy.Chapin, Helen B. \\"Three Early Portraits of Bodhidharma\\". p. 93 Another popular legend is that after falling asleep during his nine-year meditation he became angry with himself and cut off his eyelids to avoid ever falling asleep again. According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent, and was either a \\"Persian Central Asian\\" or a \\"South Indian ... the third son of a great Indian king.\\"Emmanuel Francis (2011), The Genealogy of the Pallavas: From Brahmins to Kings, Religions of South Asia, Vol. 5, No. 1/5.2 (2011) Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as an ill- tempered, profusely-bearded, wide-eyed non-Chinese person. He is referred as \\"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\\" () in Chan texts. History and commercialization A wooden mold for a papier-m√¢ch√© Maneki-neko and Okiagari-Koboshi Daruma figure from the Edo Period, 18th century. Brooklyn Museum. The current popular symbolism associated with Daruma as a good luck charm in part originated with the Daruma-dera (Temple of Daruma) in the city of Takasaki (Gunma Prefecture, north of Tokyo). Josef Kyburz, author of \\"Omocha\\": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with, explained that the founder of Daruma-Dera would draw New Year‚Äôs charms depicting Bodhidharma. The parishioners would keep these charms to \\"bring happiness and prosperity and ward off accidents and misfortune\\".\\"Omocha\\": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with p.15 It is believed that the Daruma figurine then originated from this region when the ninth priest, Togaku, found a solution to handle the constant requests of the parishioners for new charms. The charms were always given with an effectiveness of one year, so the people required new ones every year. He solved this by entrusting them with the making of their own Daruma charms near the beginning of the Meiwa period (1764‚Äì72). The temple made wooden block molds for the people to use. The peasants then used these molds to make three- dimensional papier-m√¢ch√© charms.\\"Omocha\\": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with p.14 Kyburz notes that though it is unknown when the Daruma figurine combined with the tumbler doll; the two were well recognized as synonymous by the mid-19th century. The doll quickly grew in popularity, becoming a mascot of the region. This was due greatly in part to fact that the majority of the families were silk farmers, a crop which requires a great deal of luck for success. There is an annual held by the city of Takasaki in celebration of being the proclaimed birthplace of the Daruma doll. The celebration is held at the Shorinzan, the name of Takasaki's \\"Daruma-Dera\\". According to the Takasaki city website, \\"Over 400,000 people from all over the Kanto Plain come to buy new good-luck dolls for the year. Takasaki produces 80% of Japan's Daruma dolls.\\" The festival also features a 24-hour reading of sutras by the Shorinzan monks for world peace. Physical features and symbolism Takasaki, Japan Daruma‚Äôs design, particularly the shape, color, eyes and facial hair, each have its own history and symbolic meaning. =Shape= Darumas are still usually made of papier-m√¢ch√©, have a round shape, are hollow and weighted at the bottom so that they will always return to an upright position when tilted over. In Japanese, a roly-poly toy is called okiagari, meaning to get up (oki) and arise (agari). This characteristic has come to symbolize the ability to have success, overcome adversity, and recover from misfortune. In Japanese popular culture on cards, banners and books, Daruma is often illustrated alongside the phrase \\"Nanakorobi Yaoki\\" (), translated to mean \\"seven times down, eight times up\\". The tumbler doll style is similar to an earlier toy called the Okiagari Koboshi, a little self-righting monk which was popular in the Kinki region during the mid-17th century. The original okiagari toy, however, is said to have been introduced from Ming China around 1368‚Äì1644.\\"Omocha\\": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with p.23 =Color= Ibaraki. Though it is not certain, the origins of Daruma's traditional red coloring probably came from the color of priest's robes. Reliable sources in English are hard to find, but one Japan-based website cites this red as being the \\"color of the robe of a high-ranking priest. The author then concludes that \\"since Daruma was the founder of the Zen Sect, he must have worn a red robe.\\" The art historian James T. Ulak has documented a history of depictions of the Bodhidharma wearing lavish red robes, prior to representations of him as a doll, in an article entitled \\"Japanese Works in The Art Institute of Chicago.\\"Japanese Works in The Art Institute of Chicago: Five Recent Acquisitions p.178 By virtue of his red robes, Daruma has come to play a role in recovering from sickness. During the late Edo period (1600s to 1868), red was believed to have a strong association to smallpox. Hartmut O. Rotermond, author of Demonic Affliction or Contagious Disease?, describes that in Edo and surrounding cities, there were many outbreaks of measles and smallpox. In present-day Japan, there are many red shrines dedicated to a God of Smallpox, which had a particular liking for red. These shrines were built in response to those outbreaks.Rotermund, Hartmut O. \\"Demonic Affliction or Contagious Disease? Changing Perceptions of Smallpox in the Late Edo Period.\\" p.1 Believing that the God of smallpox, if pleased, would spare the inflicted child, the Japanese would often stretch out ropes around the house strung with red paper strips, have the child wear a red robe, and make a small altar for the God to put talisman-like Daruma figurines on.Rotermund, Hartmut O. \\"Demonic Affliction or Contagious Disease? Changing Perceptions of Smallpox in the Late Edo Period\\". p.374 These precautions were also used to warn others that sickness was in the house, and to encourage cleanliness around the sick. The red of Daruma, however, was used to pacify the God, while the image of okiagari was to encourage the patient to recover as quickly as they fell ill. Daruma are also sold as a set of five colors ‚Äì blue, yellow, red, white and black ‚Äì called Goshiki Daruma. These days, daruma can also be found in colors other than red, including gold, which is meant to bring luck in financial matters. =Eyes= A daruma doll with one eye filled in for wishing The eyes of Daruma are often blank when sold. Monte A. Greer, author of Daruma Eyes, described the \\"oversized symmetrical round blank white eyes\\" as a means to keep track of goals or big tasks and motivate them to work to the finish. The recipient of the doll fills in one eye upon setting the goal, then the other upon fulfilling it. In this way, every time they see the one-eyed Daruma, they recall the goal. One explanation how this custom started says that in order to motivate Daruma-san to grant your wish, you promise to give him full sight once the goal is accomplished. This practice might also have something to do with the \\"enlightenment\\", the ideal attainment of Buddhism. This custom has led to a phrase in Japanese translated as \\"Both Eyes Open\\". Referring to \\"opening\\" the second eye, it expresses the realization of a goal.Greer, Monte A. \\"Daruma Eyes: The Sixth Century Founder of Zen Buddhism and Kung Fu Had the Earliest Recorded Graves p.1 Traditionally, the Daruma was purchased as a household, and only the head of the household would paint in the eyes.Punsmann, Henry. \\"Daruma, a Symbol of Luck\\". p.5 One example of this is politicians during election time. Political parties have often been shown at their headquarters with large Daruma dolls and amulets purchased from local temples as a prayer for victory. This practice was highlighted in a 1967 article in Time magazine: \\"Last week, in the Tokyo headquarters of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Premier Eisaku Sat≈ç dipped a sumi brush into an ink stone and with swift strokes daubed in the dark right eye of his Daruma. 'The eyes,' he remarked when he had finished, 'are as big as my own.'\\"\\"Japan: The Right Eye of Daruma\\". Time. p. 1 =Facial hair= Daruma's facial hair is a symbolic representation of the animals well known in Asian culture to embody longevity: the crane and the tortoise. The eyebrows are in the shape of a crane, while the cheek hair resembles the shell of the tortoise. A Japanese-based website states that originally, there was a snake or dragon depicted across the moustache and cheeks, but was changed to tortoise to emphasize the desire for longevity. In this way, Daruma was designed to match the Japanese proverb \\"The crane lives 1000 years, the tortoise 10,000 years\\". Daruma burning Burning of the daruma At the end of the year, all the Daruma are brought back to the temple they were purchased from for a traditional burning ceremony. This ceremony, called the , is held once a year, usually right after New Year's Day. The most renowned of these events are held at the Nishi-Arai Daishi Temple (Tokyo), and the Dairy≈´-ji Temple (Gifu). At these events, people bring the Daruma figures they had used that year to the temple. After expressing gratitude to them, they turn them over to the temple and buy new ones for the next year. All of the old Daruma figures are burnt together in the temple. After a solemn display of the monks' entry, reading of the sutras and blowing of horns, the tens of thousands of figurines are then set aflame. Feminine representations Daruma dolls also come in the form of and . This contrasts greatly with traditional representations of Dharma, who, accredited as the father of many martial arts, has traditionally been depicted as very masculine with rough facial hair.McFarland, H. Neill. \\"Feminine Motifs in Bodhidharma Symbology in Japan\\" p. 170. H. Neill McFarland, Professor of Theology, discusses the feminine representations of Bodhidharma in his article Feminine Motifs in Bodhidharma Symbology in Japan. The answer to this anomaly lies in the social changes at the time, developing in the Edo Period. The class distinctions placed the merchants at the bottom, who in turn developed their own culture focusing on humor and poking fun at what those of higher class held sacred. This is evident in the depiction of Dharma as a prostitute since prostitutes displayed the same \\"okiagari\\" resilience. Famous pieces of art depicting Bodhidharma were also redrawn with a woman in his place. With the inception of the Daruma doll, the Onna Daruma doll quickly followed. Though the aforementioned examples of feminine motifs of Daruma were satirical, the doll forms maintain the same wholesome image of a bringer of good luck.McFarland, H. Neill. \\"Feminine Motifs in Bodhidharma Symbology in Japan\\" p. 172 Children's games Daruma Otoshi. The Daruma character, hammer and rainbow-colored pieces. Many children's games make mention of Daruma. The Japanese equivalent of a snowman is a , literally snow daruma. Darumasan ga Koronda is an equivalent to the American Red light/Green light game. is a traditional game played with a daruma doll in five pieces, usually in the colors of the rainbow, from top to bottom: head ‚Äì a man's face, blue, green, yellow, red. The game is played by using a small hammer to hit each of the colored pieces, from bottom to the top, without letting the pieces fall during the game.

Since 2001, the band's lineup has also included guitarist James Bowman. After releasing three studio albums through independent record labels, Against Me! moved to Sire Records for 2007's New Wave, which reached no. 57 on the Billboard 200. In 2011, the band launched their own record label, Total Treble, through which to release future albums. In 2012, Grace publicly came out as a transgender woman. After a long period of line-up changes and uncertainty surrounding the band's future, their sixth studio album, Transgender Dysphoria Blues, was released independently in January 2014 to critical and commercial acclaim. The band's seventh full-length, Shape Shift with Me, was released September 16, 2016.  History  =1997‚Äì2002: The early years and Reinventing Axl Rose= Against Me! was formed in 1997 by singer/guitarist Laura Jane Grace as a solo act, amidst the breakup of her previous band(s). The first Against Me! release was an eponymously titled demo tape in 1997. It was self-released in very limited numbers. With the addition of drummer Kevin Mahon, a second demo, Vivida Vis! (1998), was released in limited numbers by Misanthrope Records. The band started their first tour in March 1999, a month-long tour of the East coast, during which they met Jordan Kleeman in Baltimore, Maryland. The band's first EP, Against Me!, was released twice through Crasshole Records (once in 1999 and 2000). Grace's longtime friend James Bowman joined the band for a west coast in support of the EP, traveling in Grace's 1976 Buick LeSabre, the engine of which exploded at the end of the tour. Their first widely distributed release was the EP Crime as Forgiven by Against Me! (2001), released by Plan-It-X Records and Sabot Productions (run by longtime Against Me! tour manager Jordan Kleeman). While neither Bowman or Fridkin had part in the recording of Crime as Forgiven by Against Me!, they both joined the band on tour to support it. On April 23, 2001, while heading south on I-75, returning home from their first tour as a four-piece band, their van was struck by a semi truck. They landed upside-down in a ditch. No one was harmed, but the van and equipment were destroyed, after which Bowman and Mahon left the band. The band broke up for a few months that year. A third EP, a self-titled acoustic recording by Grace and bassist Dustin Fridkin, was released in November 2001. Mahon was eventually replaced by Warren Oakes, and guitarist James Bowman returned in December 2001 during the recording of the band's first album, Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose, released in March 2002 by No Idea Records. Fridkin left during the summer of 2002 to return to college and was replaced by Andrew Seward of the Tennessee band kill devil hills, and this new lineup released the single \\"The Disco Before the Breakdown\\" (2002). This lineup remained intact until 2009. =2003‚Äì06: As the Eternal Cowboy and Searching for a Former Clarity = Against Me! signed to Fat Wreck Chords and released their second album, 2003's Against Me! as the Eternal Cowboy. It reached no. 36 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart and was supported by singles for \\"Cavalier Eternal\\" and \\"Sink, Florida, Sink\\". The DVD We're Never Going Home followed, documenting their Spring 2004 tour. 2005's Searching for a Former Clarity was their first album to chart on the Billboard 200, reaching no. 114. Against Me! supported the album with a tour of all 50 U.S. states. It spawned singles for \\"Don't Lose Touch\\" and \\"From Her Lips to God's Ears (The Energizer)\\", which also became the band's first music videos. The live album Americans Abroad!!! Against Me!!! Live in London!!! followed in 2006. =2007‚Äì10: New Wave and White Crosses= Against Me! moved to Sire Records for 2007's New Wave, produced by Butch Vig. It debuted at no. 57 on the Billboard 200 and featured their first charting single, \\"Thrash Unreal\\", which reached no. 11 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart. \\"White People for Peace\\", \\"Stop!\\", and \\"New Wave\\" were also released as singles, and New Wave was named as Spins album of the year. The DVD Live at the Key Club followed later that year. In 2008, Against Me! supported Foo Fighters on a North American tour, and Sire released the digital EP New Wave B-Sides. In October 2008, while traveling west on I-80, en route to Salt Lake City, their tour bus hit a patch of ice; causing it to spin and land on its side in a ditch. Also, their trailer broke free from the hitch and all of their equipment was strewn in the middle of the highway. Thankfully, no one was harmed. Oakes left the band in June 2009, in part to focus on running his Mexican food restaurant. \\"I didn't want to play music with Warren anymore\\", said Grace, \\"it's been a long time coming. Warren's heart hasn't been in this for a while now.\\" Oakes was replaced by Hot Water Music drummer George Rebelo. The following month Fat Wreck Chords released The Original Cowboy, an album of demo recordings from the Against Me! as the Eternal Cowboy sessions. On August 17, 2009, Against Me! headed into the studio with New Wave producer Butch Vig. Against Me! joined Billy Talent on tour in Canada in March 2010, and also supported the Silversun Pickups on a tour of the United States that summer, bringing along touring keyboardist Franz Nicolay. Against Me! released White Crosses, their second album with Sire, on June 8, 2010 (although it was leaked about 3 months earlier). It was supported by singles for \\"I Was a Teenage Anarchist\\", \\"White Crosses\\", and \\"High Pressure Low\\" and was their highest-charting album to date, reaching no. 34 on the Billboard 200. On the eve of a scheduled tour of Australia and New Zealand that September, the band suddenly cancelled all touring plans due to \\"a culmination of circumstances\\", expressing the need to \\"take some time off from touring to go home and sort things out.\\" November 2010 saw Against Me!'s departure from Sire Records, their first (and only) major label. Following a two-month hiatus from touring, the band spoke for the first time since their tour cancellation, talking of their upcoming December 2010 shows, which saw Jay Weinberg cover for George Rebelo on drums, as he toured with Hot Water Music. Throughout December 2010, Grace spoke of George Rebelo's intentions to record an album with his primary band Hot Water Music. In January 2011, Weinberg was officially confirmed as Against Me!'s new drummer. Total Clarity, an album of demos and unreleased songs from the Searching for a Former Clarity sessions, was released on May 24, 2011, through Fat Wreck Chords. =2011‚Äì17: Transgender Dysphoria Blues and Shape Shift with Me= Grace had expressed the desire to release at least one album per year for the next decade and that Grace hoped to record Against Me!'s sixth studio album in Winter 2011. As well as this, she spoke of releasing a 7\\" on Sabot Productions before Summer 2011, featuring two original songs. This was announced as being Russian Spies / Occult Enemies, which was released on June 14, 2011. In the same studio session, the band recorded a cover of the theme song for a season 8 episode of One Tree Hill, which aired May 3. On June 3, 2011, the band announced that they started their own record label, Total Treble. In July 2011, the band released \\"Black Crosses\\" which were demos /alternate versions of songs from \\"White Crosses\\". In September 2011, Grace built a recording studio in Elkton, Florida, for future Against Me! projects. The studio has since been named Total Treble Studio. The first band to record an album in the studio were Cheap Girls from Lansing, Michigan, with their album Giant Orange. In May 2012 Grace publicly came out as transgender, having dealt with gender dysphoria since childhood, and began her transition. \\"I felt like I drop-kicked them in the face,\\" she said of informing the other members of Against Me! \\"We had the most awkward hug ever, and then they left. And the second I shut the door, I was like, 'What the fuck did I just do? Gender dysphoria is the theme of the band's sixth studio album, an autobiographical account of Laura Jane Grace's experience as a trans woman and of social and body dysphoria. They began recording in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, working without Butch Vig, who produced New Wave and White Crosses. Instead, Grace was acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. Weinberg departed the group that December. Drummer Atom Willard filled in with the band for their 2013 Australian tour dates, and was confirmed as the band's new drummer on July 31, 2013. In March 2013, the band canceled their US tour with Bad Religion. In May 2013, bassist Andrew Seward also announced his departure from the band. Grace has expressed that she felt the band might not continue under the name Against Me!, but will, however, because she believes the new record has a message she wants to spread. On June 24, 2013, Grace announced that recording for Transgender Dysphoria Blues was finished. Grace went on a solo tour in August in a handful of east coast US cities in support of the record. On July 15, 2013, Against Me! released the \\"True Trans\\" single for free, featuring the new acoustic song \\"FUCKMYLIFE666\\" and the namesake \\"True Trans Soul Rebel\\". On August 29, 2013, Inge Johansson, formerly of The (International) Noise Conspiracy and Refused, was confirmed as the new bass player. On January 21, 2014, Against Me! released Transgender Dysphoria Blues, their sixth full-length studio album. The album was praised for its raw quality, reminiscent of Against Me!'s earlier music. It is their highest- charting album to date, reaching no. 23 on the Billboard 200. A new live album, 23 Live Sex Acts was recorded on the subsequent tour by the band in 2014, and was released on September 4, 2015. In July 2016, the band announced their seventh studio album Shape Shift with Me would be released on September 16. The band also immediately released a song from the album, \\"333\\". On August 10, 2016, a second song, \\"Haunting, Haunted, Haunts\\" was released via the Adult Swim Singles Program 2016. A Star Wars-inspired music video for the song \\"Crash\\" was then released on August 22. On September 8, the entire album was available for streaming. Shape Shift with Me, was released September 16, 2016. In October 2017, Against Me! played a special show with former bassist Dustin Fridkin for the first time since his departure from the band in 2002. The band's first album Reinventing Axl Rose was played in full for the first time, as well as other tracks from the era. The show was part of FEST 16. Grace revealed in August 2018 that she strongly considered disbanding Against Me! once this show had occurred. =2018‚Äìpresent: Seward's return, forthcoming LP and ‚Äú2 Nights / 4 Records / 48 Songs‚Äù tour= Against Me! played their final show with bassist Inge Johansson in May 2018. The following month, the band played an unannounced show at Trumbullplex in Detroit, MI. The show was notable for being the first show with Andrew Seward playing bass since 2013, although no songs were played from Shape Shift with Me. Grace officially announced in July 2018 via Instagram that after performing these shows, Seward had rejoined the band. In October 2018, the band played two shows on the eve of their South American tour: one with As the Eternal Cowboy played front to back, and the other with New Wave. Laura Jane Grace announced in July 2018 that the band she had performed previous solo tours with since 2016, The Devouring Mothers, had recently completed a record together. Bought to Rot was released on Bloodshot Records on November 9, 2018. The band's members since its inception have been Grace and Willard from Against Me!, as well as long- time producer and collaborator Marc Hudson. The album is said to be heavily influenced by the works of Rowland S. Howard and Tom Petty, and includes collaborations with other artists. Grace confirmed that Against Me! is still continuing as a band, as a clean slate, and that an eighth Against Me! record is still planned for eventual release, but that it may be shelved and/or re- recorded following Seward's replacement of Johansson as bassist. The band recorded a cover of The Jim Carroll Band's \\"People Who Died\\" for a 2018 compilation album (Songs That Saved My Life) in aid of mental health charities. The track is the first recording with Seward back as bassist since the 2011 single \\"Russian Spies / Occult Enemies\\", and Grace used the announcement to further confirm that the band intend to record an eighth studio album together. The band began work on their eighth studio album in February 2019.https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/1094636157739118592 In May 2019, the band announced their ‚Äú2 Nights / 4 Records / 48 Songs‚Äù tour.

Treaty of Peace. Signed at Moscow, 12 March 1940; ratifications exchanged, 21 March 1940. The American Journal of International Law 34 (3), Supplement: Official Documents. (July 1940), pp.127‚Äì131. It marked the end of the 105-day Winter War, upon which Finland ceded border areas to the Soviet Union. The treaty was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov, Andrey Zhdanov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky for the Soviet Union, and Risto Ryti, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, Rudolf Walden and V√§in√∂ Voionmaa for Finland. The terms of the treaty were not reversed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the Karelian question remains disputed. Background The Finnish government received the first tentative peace conditions from the Soviet Union (through Stockholm) on 31 January 1940. By then, the Soviets made larger claims than they had before the war started. The demands were for Finland to cede the Karelian Isthmus, including the city of Viipuri, and Finland's shore of Lake Ladoga. The Hanko Peninsula was to be leased to the Soviet Union for 30 years. Finland rejected the demands and intensified its pleas to Sweden, France and the United Kingdom for military support by regular troops. The reports from the front still held out hope for Finland, anticipating a League of Nations intervention. Positive signals, however inconstant, from France and Britain and more realistic expectations of troops from Sweden, for which plans and preparations had been made throughout the 1930s, were further reasons for Finland not to rush into peace negotiations. (See for more details.) In February 1940, Finland's commander- in-chief, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim expressed his pessimism about the military situation, which prompted the government to start peace talks on 29 February, the same day the Red Army started an attack on Viipuri (now Vyborg).  Terms  Finnish Foreign Minister alt= On 6 March, a Finnish delegation, led by Finnish Prime Minister Risto Ryti, travelled to Moscow. During the negotiations, the Red Army broke through the Finnish defence lines around Tali and were close to surrounding Viipuri. The treaty was signed on the evening of 12 March, Moscow Time, or 1 hour on 13 March, Finnish time. The protocol appended to the treaty stipulated that the fighting should end at noon, Leningrad time (11:00 Finnish time), and the fighting continued until then.–°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–∫–æ–≤, –í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä, –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ë–∞–ª–∞—à–æ–≤. –í ¬´–ù–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–∞—Ö¬ª: –ò–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –æ—Å–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–∞—Ä–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—à–µ–π–∫–∞, 1940‚Äì1941, 1944‚Äì1950 . Saint Petersburg: –ù–æ—Ä–¥–º–µ–¥–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 2001. p. 5 Finnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded those demanded by the Soviets before the war. Finland was forced to cede approximately half of Finnish Karelia (with Finland's industrial centre, including Vyborg/Viipuri (Finland's fourth-largest city) and K√§kisalmi; Sortavala and Suoj√§rvi and the whole of Viipuri Bay, with its islands; in total, nearly 10% of the territory) even though large parts were still held by the Finnish army. Military troops and remaining civilians were hastily evacuated to inside the new border; 422,000 Karelians, 12% of Finland's population, lost their homes. There was also an area that the Russians captured during the war that remained in Finnish hands according to the treaty: Petsamo. The treaty also stipulated that Finland would grant free passage for Soviet civilians through Petsamo to Norway. Finland also had to cede a part of the Salla area, the Finnish part of the Kalastajansaarento (Rybachi) Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and in the Gulf of Finland the islands of Suursaari, Tyt√§rsaari, Lavansaari (now Moshchny Island –æ. –ú–æ—â–Ω—ã–π), Peninsaari (now Maly Island, –æ. –ú–∞–ª—ã–π) and Seiskari. Finally, the Hanko Peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base for 30 years at an annual rent of 8 million marks. Contrary to a common belief, the Soviet troops' transfer rights by railway to the Hanko base were not granted in the peace treaty, but they were demanded on 9 July, after Sweden had acknowledged the railway transit of Wehrmacht troops to occupied Norway. Additional demands were the handing over any equipment and installations on the territories that were ceded. Thus Finland had to hand over 75 locomotives; 2,000 railroad cars and a number of cars, trucks and ships. The Enso industrial area, which was clearly on the Finnish side of the border, as it was drawn in the peace treaty, was also soon added to the Finnish losses of territory and equipment. The new border was not arbitrary from the Soviet viewpoint: * Before the war, Finland had been a leading producer of high quality pulp, which was an important raw material for explosives. By including the Enso factories, the Soviet Union captured 80% of Finland's production capacity. * Finland had to cede a third of its hydroelectric power, mainly in the form of hydroelectric power plants on the Vuoksi River, which was badly needed in Leningrad, where the industry suffered a 20% shortage of electricity. * The location of the new border was consistent with the Soviet defence doctrine, which envisioned taking the fight onto enemy soil by counterattacks and pre-emptive strikes. Under that doctrine, the ideal border should not allow the enemy to have natural defensible barriers and so instead of running through natural border locations, like the Bay of Viipuri or the swamp region in the isthmus between Lake Saimaa and Lake Ladoga, the new border ran on the western side of them. However, those positions were also very easy to encircle for an offensive enemy of the Red Army, as would soon be shown. The Finns were shocked by the harsh peace terms. It seemed as if more territory was lost in the peace than in the war, in many ways some of the highest-valued areas of Finland. The loss of territory was painful for Finland in several ways: * Large parts of the most populated southern region that remained in Finland had been connected to the world via the Saimaa Canal system, which now was severed at Vyborg, where it connects to the Gulf of Finland. * The southern part of the lost area was Finland's industrial heart. * Karelians and Finns are closely related Finno-Ugric peoples. About half of Finnish Karelia was lost as a result of the treaty, which led to the Karelian question. * Before the war, Soviet atrocities against Ingrian Finns had been a major source of grief for many Finns. Losing part of Finnish Karelia added to this anguish. Aftermath Sympathy from world opinion seemed to have been of little worth. A certain bitter disappointment became a common feature of the Finns' view of other nations, especially the Swedes, who had offered plenty of sympathy but did not fulfill their obligations of military support for Finland. The harsh terms imposed on the Finns led them to seek support from Nazi Germany. The Winter War and the subsequent peace treaty were core factors in leading to what would become the Continuation War. In the end, that might have been a necessary condition for Finland's survival during war. Only a year later, in June 1941, hostilities resumed during the Continuation War.

Richard Aartsz, or Rijckaert Aertsz (1482 ‚Äì May 1577) was a Dutch Renaissance painter of historical allegories. Most of his works were painted while he lived in Antwerp. He was a pupil of Jan Mostaert in Haarlem. Frans Floris became his pupil and friend. Biography Rykert (or Rijck) was born in Wijk aan Zee, (Beverwijk) and was the son of a fisherman. As a boy he had burned his leg, so he was sent to Haarlem for treatment, but because of an incompetent doctor or because it was simply too late, the wound further deteriorated until his leg had to be amputated, which compelled him to walk with a crutch. That's why he was nicknamed Rijk met de Stelt (Rich with the Crutch), which is his now his best known artist name. Rijckaert Aertsz. oft Rijck metter stelt, Schilder, van Wijck op d'Zee in Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature During his period of recovery, he often sat near the fire, and drew on the white stone hearth wall with charcoals, which he did so well that his parents asked if he would like to be a painter or draughtsman, and when he responded seriously in the affirmative, he was apprenticed to Jan Mostaert, then a master of a painting workshop in Haarlem. He was such a studious apprentice that he soon became a good artist himself. He painted the altar doors of the Carrier's guild (Zakkendragersgilde, a guild for turf carriers and other cart trades) in the St. Bavochurch. The altar itself had been painted earlier by Jacob van Haarlem, the master of Mostaert. The altar door subjects were designed by Rijck, and were the history of Joseph (son of Jacob); one side was devoted to his brothers who came for grain, and the other side was Joseph himself seated like a king, hiding his identity for his brothers in Egypt; pieces which were highly praised. Rijck was a successful painter who painted many pieces in Friesland, but most of these were destroyed during the Beeldenstorm. Rijck eventually traveled to Antwerp where he married Catharina Dircksdr and joined the Guild of Saint Luke in 1520.Inghist biography of Rijckaert Aertsz He was able to make a living by painting the flesh tones (\\"naeckten\\" can also mean nudes) for other painters in return for a day-wage. He died there in May 1577, famed as a quiet, happy, peaceful and pious man, much loved for his good mood. In reference to his name and crutch, he often said \\"Ik ben rijk en wel gestelt\\" (\\"I am rich and well off\\", a pun on his name Rijckaert ( means rich, while means rich man), and having to use a crutch ( means with a crutch, while means well off). In his old age, his vision was badly impaired, so that he was barely able to see what he was doing. When he put the paint on the panels so thickly that no one liked it, the paint often needed to be scraped off again, which upset him because he felt no one appreciated his work. His portrait was painted by his friend Frans Floris around 1560, as the central figure in a painting of St. Luke for the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, probably because he was an upbeat and popular character in the guild. He was the father of the painter Lambert Ryck Aertsz, called Robbesant.

The office produces and distributes information products and services for all three branches of the Federal Government, including U.S. passports for the Department of State as well as the official publications of the Supreme Court, the Congress, the Executive Office of the President, executive departments, and independent agencies. An act of Congress changed the office's name to its current form in 2014. History U.S. Government Publishing Office The Government Printing Office was created by congressional joint resolution () on June 23, 1860. It began operations March 4, 1861, with 350 employees and reached a peak employment of 8,500 in 1972. The agency began transformation to computer technology in the 1980s; along with the gradual replacement of paper with electronic document distribution, this has led to a steady decline in the number of staff at the agency. For its entire history, the GPO has occupied the corner of North Capitol Street NW and H Street NW in the District of Columbia. The large red brick building that houses the GPO was erected in 1903 and is unusual in being one of the few large, red brick government structures in a city where most government buildings are mostly marble and granite. (The Smithsonian Castle and the Pension Building, now the National Building Museum, are other exceptions.) An additional structure was attached to its north in later years. The activities of the GPO are defined in the public printing and documents chapters of Title 44 of the United States Code. The Director (formerly the Public Printer), who serves as the head of the GPO, is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Director selects a Superintendent of Documents. The Superintendent of Documents (SuDocs) is in charge of the dissemination of information at the GPO. This is accomplished through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), the Cataloging and Indexing Program and the Publication Sales Program, as well as operation of the Federal Citizen Information Center in Pueblo, Colorado. Adelaide Hasse was the founder of the Superintendent of Documents classification system. The GPO first used 100 percent recycled paper for the Congressional Record and Federal Register from 1991 to 1997, under Public Printers Robert Houk and Michael DiMario. The GPO resumed using recycled paper in 2009. In March 2011, the GPO issued a new illustrated official history covering the agency's 150 years of \\"Keeping America Informed\\". With demand for print publications falling and a move underway to digital document production and preservation, the name of the GPO was officially changed to \\"Government Publishing Office\\" in a provision of an omnibus government funding bill passed by Congress in December 2014.Andrew Siddons, \\"Government Printer Renamed for Digital Age\\", The New York Times, Dec. 12, 2014. Following signature of this legislation by President Barack Obama, the name change took place on December 17, 2014. Public Printers of the United States By law, the Public Printer heads the GPO. The position of Public Printer traces its roots back to Benjamin Franklin and the period before the American Revolution, when he served as \\"publick printer\\", whose job was to produce official government documents for Pennsylvania and other colonies. When the agency was renamed in December 2014 the title \\"Public Printer\\" was also changed to \\"Director\\". Davita Vance-Cooks was therefore the first \\"Director\\" of the GPO.

Originally titled More Grease, the film was produced by Allan Carr and Robert Stigwood, and directed and choreographed by Patricia Birch, who also choreographed the first film and the Broadway musical. It takes place two years after the original film at Rydell High School, set in the 1961‚Äì1962 school year, with an almost entirely new cast, led by actors Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer in her first starring role. The film was released theatrically in the United States on June 11, 1982, and grossed over $15 million against a production budget of $11 million. The film, now known for being the breakout roles for Pfeiffer and Christopher McDonald, was otherwise poorly received, with Grease co-creator Jim Jacobs (who did not have any involvement with Grease 2) particularly displeased with it. Plot It is 1961, two years after the original Grease ended. The first day of school has arrived (\\"Alma Mater\\" from the original musical) as Principal McGee and her secretary Blanche react in horror as the students, among them the new T-Birds and Pink Ladies, arrive at high school (\\"Back to School Again\\"). The Pink Ladies are now led by Stephanie Zinone, who feels she has \\"outgrown\\" her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Johnny Nogerelli, the arrogant and rather immature new leader of the T-Birds. A new arrival comes in the form of clean- cut English student Michael Carrington (a cousin of Sandy Olsson from the previous film). He is welcomed and introduced to the school atmosphere by Frenchy, who was asked by Sandy to help show Michael around. Frenchy reveals she has returned to Rydell to get her high school diploma so she can start her own cosmetics company. Michael eventually meets Stephanie and quickly becomes smitten with her. At the local bowling alley, a game (\\"Score Tonight\\") turns sour due to the animosity between Johnny and Stephanie. Stephanie retaliates by kissing the next man who walks in the door, who happens to be Michael. Bemused by this unexpected kiss, Michael falls in love with Stephanie so asks her out, but he learns that she has a very specific vision of her ideal man (\\"Cool Rider\\"). After realising that he will only win her affections if he turns himself into a cool rider, Michael accepts payments from the T-Birds to write term papers for them; he uses the cash to buy a motorcycle. Following an unusual biology lesson (\\"Reproduction\\") given by Mr. Stuart, a substitute teacher, a gang of rival motorcyclists called the Cycle Lords (most of whom are members of the defunct Scorpions) led by Leo Balmudo, surprise the T-Birds at the bowling alley. Before the fight starts, a lone mysterious (unnamed) biker appears (who is actually Michael in disguise), defeats the enemy gang and disappears into the night (\\"Who's That Guy?\\"). Stephanie is fascinated with the stranger. Meanwhile, Louis, one of the T-Birds, attempts to trick his sweetheart Sharon, one of the Pink Ladies and Stephanie's friends into losing her virginity to him by taking her to a fallout shelter and faking a nuclear attack (\\"Let's Do It for Our Country.\\") The next evening while working at a gas station/garage, Stephanie is surprised again by the Cool Rider, and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride, which includes a kiss. Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity, they are interrupted by the arrival of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Before Michael leaves, he tells Stephanie that he will see her at the school talent show, in which the Pink Ladies and T-Birds are performing. Johnny, enraged by Stephanie's new romance, threatens to fight the Cool Rider if he sees him with her again. The Pink Ladies walk away haughtily, but this has little effect on the T-Birds' self-confidence (\\"Prowlin'\\"). At school, Stephanie's poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer of help. Johnny, upon seeing them together in a discussion, demands that Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies to preserve his honor (\\"rep\\", reputation). Although still enchanted by the mysterious Cool Rider, interactions with Michael reveal that she has become romantically interested in him as well. Michael ponders over the continuing charade he puts on for Stephanie (\\"Charades\\"). At the talent show, Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet up but are abruptly ambushed by the T-Birds who pursue Michael on their respective motorcycles, with Stephanie, Sharon, Paulette, and Rhonda following in a car. They chase him to a construction site which conceals a deadly drop, and the biker's absence suggests that he has perished below, leaving Stephanie heartbroken and inconsolable. Johnny and his T-Birds remove the competing Preptones ‚Äì preppie boys ‚Äì by tying them to a shower pole in the boys' locker room and drenching them. During the Pink Ladies' performance in the talent show (\\"Girl for All Seasons\\"), Stephanie enters a dreamlike fantasy world where she is reunited with her mystery biker (\\"(Love Will) Turn Back the Hands of Time\\"). She is named winner of the contest and crowned the queen of the upcoming graduation luau, with Johnny hailed as king for his performance of \\"Prowlin'\\" with his fellow T-Birds. The school year ends with the luau (\\"Rock- a-Hula Luau\\"), during which the Cycle Lords appear and begin to destroy the celebration. However, the Cool Rider reappears. After he defeats the Cycle Lords again, he reveals himself to be Michael. Initially shocked, Johnny gives him a T-Birds jacket, officially welcoming him into the gang, and Stephanie is delighted that she can now be with him. Michael and Stephanie share a very passionate kiss and he whispers that he loves her. All the couples pair off happily at the seniors' graduation as the graduating class sings (\\"We'll Be Together\\"). The credits start rolling in yearbook-style, as in the original film (\\"Back To School Again\\"). Cast * Maxwell Caulfield as Michael Carrington, an English exchange student, Sandy's cousin. Upon meeting the leader of the Pink Ladies, Stephanie Zinone, Michael instantly falls in love with her. Michael comes up with his alter ego \\"Cool Rider\\" after failing to ask Stephanie out and learning she has a \\"certain type\\" of guy to date. Michael's new persona as the \\"Cool Rider\\" manages to make Stephanie fall in love with the alter ego and not Michael himself. Caulfield had already made his Broadway debut with roles in The Elephant Man and Entertaining Mr. Sloane. Having seen his performances, Allan Carr offered Caulfield the role of Michael over thousands of applicants. Unlike co-star Pfeiffer, Caulfield's career following Grease 2 was damaged by the film's failure. He has been quoted as saying: \\"Before Grease 2 came out, I was being hailed as the next Richard Gere or John Travolta. However, when Grease 2 flopped, nobody would touch me. It felt like a bucket of cold water had been thrown in my face. It took me 10 years to get over Grease 2.\\"Maxwell Caulfield trivia at movietome.com * Michelle Pfeiffer as Stephanie Zinone, the leader of the Pink Ladies. Stephanie is sick of \\"being someone's chick\\" after her split with T-Birds leader Johnny and becomes infatuated by a mysterious biker (who is really Michael in disguise) and falls in love with him. Stephanie ends up also falling for the clean cut new guy Michael after he helps her with her essay and the two get closer. Stephanie tells Michael she would date him if there wasn't a pink lady code: \\"The Pink Ladies are the T-Birds chicks\\". With only a few television roles and small film appearances, the 23-year-old Pfeiffer was an unknown actress when she attended the casting call audition for the role of Stephanie. Other better-known actresses up for the part included Lisa Hartman, Kristy McNichol, Andrea McArdle, and singer Pat Benatar.http://www.pfeiffertheface.com/Bio_014.htm Pfeiffer was a wild card choice, but according to Birch, she won the part because she \\"has a quirky quality you don't expect.\\"http://www.pfeiffertheface.com/Bio_013.htm The T-Birds * Adrian Zmed as Johnny Nogerelli * Christopher McDonald as Goose McKenzie * Peter Frechette as Louis DiMucci * Leif Green as Davey Jaworski The Pink Ladies * Maureen Teefy as Sharon Cooper * Lorna Luft as Paulette Rebchuck * Alison Price as Rhonda Ritter * Pamela Segall as Dolores Rebchuck = Reprising roles from Grease = * Didi Conn as \\"Frenchy\\" Facciano * Eve Arden as Principal Greta McGee (Arden's final theatrical role) * Sid Caesar as Coach Vince Calhoun * Dody Goodman as Secretary Blanche Hodel * Eddie Deezen as Eugene Felsnick * Dennis C.

Carr decided to hire Patricia Birch as director for the sequel, as she had previously served as the choreographer for the stage and film versions of Grease. Birch was initially hesitant to accept after learning that neither composers Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey nor John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John would be involved in the film. Bronte Woodard, the writer who adapted the original stage material for the original film, had died in 1980, and Canadian comic Ken Finkleman (who was also writing and directing Airplane II at the same time) was tasked with penning a new script mostly from scratch. The total budget for the production was $11.2 million, almost double the budget of the original. Grease 2 was intended to be the second film (and first sequel) in a proposed Grease franchise of four films and a television series. (The third and fourth films were to take place in the 1960s and during the counterculture era.) However, the projects were scrapped due to the underwhelming box office performance of Grease 2.Grease 2 Trivia at the Internet Movie Database Maxwell Caulfield was unhappy with the film's \\"drab\\" title, and unsuccessfully lobbied to change it to Son of Grease. =Casting= Birch proposed an idea to feature Travolta and Newton-John reprising their characters as a now married couple running a gas station near the end of the film, which did not come to fruition. Paramount tried to get Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing from the first film to do cameos but this did not happen (Channing had left Hollywood for a time in the early 1980s to focus on her stage career). Timothy Hutton was announced as a male star, but Maxwell Caulfield was signed after impressing producers on Broadway in Entertaining Mister Sloane. Pfeiffer had only made a few films before: > That was really weird for me. I'd been taking singing lessons and I had > taken dance, because I loved to dance, but I had never considered myself a > professional at all. I went on this audition as a fluke, and somehow, > through the process of going back and dancing, and then going back and > singing, I ended up getting the part. I went crazy with that movie. I came > to New York and the paparazzi were waiting at the hotel. I know the > producers put them up to it. I am basically very private, and I'm really > nervous about doing publicity. Every time I set up an interview, I say, > \\"That's it, this is my last one. I'll do this because I committed to doing > it, but I'm never doing another one.\\" It was insane. Lorna Luft was the last star cast. The part played by Connie Stevens was originally meant for Annette Funicello but she was unable to appear because her schedule as Skippy peanut butter spokeswoman did not allow her time to film the scene. Adrian Zmed had previously played the role of Danny Zuko in the stage version of Grease, a role he would later reprise in the 1990s. =Filming= Scenes at Rydell High School were filmed at Excelsior High School, a recently closed high school in Norwalk, California. Filming took place throughout a 58-day shooting schedule during the autumn of 1981. According to director Birch, the script was still incomplete when filming commenced. Sequences that were filmed but cut during post-production include scenes in which Frenchy helps Michael become a motorcycle rider, and a sequence at the end of the film showing Michael and Stephanie flying off into the sky on a motorcycle. In the film, after Stephanie wins the contest, it goes on to show the stakeout in the final scene. Originally, there were a few minutes dedicated to a scene in which Michael (believed to be dead in his alter ego, by Stephanie) comes out on stage as Stephanie is exiting the stage, unbeknownst to her that he is the cool rider and he is alive. He attempts to ask her what's wrong and she storms past him and runs off crying, then it cuts to the stakeout. There was a scene within the \\"Who's that Guy?\\" number in which Goose accidentally smashes Rhonda's nose at the Bowl-A-Rama door. None of these scenes have been shown since the film's release.

The site's consensus read: \\"Grease 2 is undeniably stocked with solid songs and well-choreographed dance sequences, but there's no getting around the fact that it's a blatant retread of its far more entertaining predecessor.\\" , on Metacritic it had a score of 52% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times condemned the film as \\"dizzy and slight, with an even more negligible plot than its predecessor had. This time the story can't even masquerade as an excuse for stringing the songs together. Songs? What songs? The numbers in Grease 2 are so hopelessly insubstantial that the cast is forced to burst into melody about pastimes like bowling.\\"Maslin, Janet. Movie Review: Grease 2 (1982): More Grease, The New York Times, 11 June 1982. Variety commended the staging of the musical numbers, writing that Patricia Birch has come up with some unusual settings (a bowling alley, a bomb shelter) for some of the scenes, and employs some sharp montage to give most of the songs and dances a fair amount of punch.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 stars out of 4, saying: \\"This movie just recycles Grease, without the stars, without the energy, without the freshness and without the grease.\\" Pfeiffer received positive notices for her first major role. The New York Times review cited her performance as the \\"one improvement\\" on the original film: \\"Miss Pfeiffer is as gorgeous as any cover girl, and she has a sullen quality that's more fitting to a Grease character than Miss Newton-John's sunniness was.\\" Variety wrote that she was \\"all anyone could ask for in the looks department, and she fills Olivia Newton-John's shoes and tight pants very well.\\" Pfeiffer told the Los Angeles Times three years later: Barry Diller of Paramount said that the film \\"on no level is as good as the first. The quality isn't there.\\" Jim Jacobs described it at the time as \\"awful ... the pits.\\" In an interview 27 years later, Jacobs noted that Grease 2 \\"still brings a brief frown to his face.\\" =Accolades= Pfeiffer was nominated for a 1983 Young Artist Award in the category of Best Young Motion Picture Actress. The film was nominated for a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture. Later on, the Stinkers would unveil their picks for the 100 worst films of the 20th century with their \\"100 Years, 100 Stinkers\\" list. Grease 2 ranked in the listed bottom 20 at #13. Remakes The film's screenplay was adapted in the Kannada (South India) feature film Premaloka, starring Ravichandran and Juhi Chawla, released in 1987, which went on to become a blockbuster. Plans for a third film In 2003, Olivia Newton-John confirmed that a second sequel was being developed. \\"They're writing it, and we'll see what happens. If the script looks good, I'll do it. But I haven't seen the script, and it has to be cleverly done.\\" In 2008, it was reported that Paramount was planning a new sequel to Grease that would debut straight to DVD. However, the project never came to fruition. In 2019, it was announced that a prequel to the original film entitled Summer Lovin' with John August attached to write the screenplay was in the works at Paramount. Stage musical The film was later adapted into a musical, \\"Cool Rider\\", with the script re-written and modified for the stage.

Devices like plotters and teletypewriters were commonly used instead of video display screens. The earliest precursors to ASCII art can be found in RTTY art, that is, pictures created by amateur radio enthusiasts with teleprinters using the Baudot code. In the early days of microcomputers, what could be shown on a typical video display screen was limited to plain and simple text, such as that found in the ASCII code set. In the early 1980s, users of IBM PC compatible computers began to experiment with ways of forming simple pictures and designs using only the 255 characters within the Extended ASCII character set, specifically known as code page 437, created by IBM. Modems and networking technology allowed computer users to communicate with each other over bulletin board systems (BBSes); the operators of these BBSes used ASCII art to enhance the aesthetic appearance of their systems. The common user interface or video mode shared by all systems was plain text. As a result, a \\"scene\\" of artists arose to fill the need for original art to distinguish one BBS from another. Evolving technology =At Home= A 4,096 color Amiga picture Many home computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s were able to display 16 colors in 320x200 or 640x200. At a time when IBM PCs were limited to monochrome (2 colors) or CGA (4 colors), the Atari 800 and Commodore 64 were being used at home to create 16-color art (see upper half of image at right). In 1985, the Commodore Amiga arrived with the ability to display 640x480 near-photorealistic 4096-color graphics that could be exported via the NTSC standard. Eventually this capability was used by Disney animators in movies such as The Little Mermaid and by TV producers in shows such as SeaQuest and Babylon 5. =Online= As computer technology developed, the American National Standards Institute X3 committee invented a standard method of terminal control using escape sequences called \\"ANSI X3.64-1979\\". This protocol allowed for text and cursor positioning as well as defining foreground and background color attributes for the text. Eventually, text artists began incorporating this new level of flexibility to the existing medium of ASCII art by adding color to their text-based art, or animating their art by manipulating the cursor control codes. This is what is commonly referred to today as \\"ANSI art\\" that is used in many scene nfos. A decade later, the popularity of ANSI art had increased significantly (largely due to the similarly increasing interest in the BBS) and ANSI artists began to form into \\"groups\\", not unlike graffiti \\"crews.\\" The first ANSI group was called Aces of ANSI Art (AAA). Though no official founding date can be established for this group, its earliest surviving tribute packs are dated December 1991 and includes art dated back to 1989. Other groups like ACiD (ANSI Creators in Demand) and iCE (Insane Creators Enterprises) quickly began to spring up. Beginning in June 1992, these groups would release their work in monthly \\"ARTPACKS,\\" which were collections of ASCII art submitted by the group's various members, as well as news and membership lists. These artpacks were then spread far and wide by BBS users. Some of the same groups from the 1990s still exist today; their art is now primarily distributed using the internet. A later method of transmitting graphics over a BBS was developed called Remote Imaging Protocol or RIP, which required special software on both the BBS and the terminal end. RIP was still basically text, but the text referred to the positions of lines, curves, fills, and other steps in drawing graphics on an EGA display of 640x350x16 colors. While RIP never caught on in the BBS world, the art scene embraced it as a form of expression, if not a viable method of displaying art on a BBS. VGA to present day 256 and 16 color progressive images from 1980s VGA card. Dithering is used to overcome color limitations. In 1987 IBM introduced the VGA card. Early VGA graphics were \\"high resolution\\" images, generally using an 8-bit depth (256 colors) and a resolution of 320x200x256, 360x480x256 (hacked Mode X), or 640x480x16 colors. VGA was not intended to be displayed via a BBS and the vast majority of the early works in the IBM PC artscene were distributed as coded executables called \\"loaders\\" or \\"intros\\" rather than raw bitmap images. In fact, it was considered to be \\"lame\\" to release an uncoded VGA work of art from the early- to mid-1990s, a sure indication that your group was not skilled enough to retain a worthy programmer. The advent of custom image viewers developed by groups within the artscene, such as ACiD View and iCEView, began to shift the perception of how VGA art should be distributed and what the accepted practice should be. A coded VGA which did not take any of the advantages of being an executable, like special effects or music, became viewed as an impractical use of disk space‚Äîall of this in turn spawned a number of competing image viewers, and even \\"Viewer Wars\\" between rival art groups. Talented underground artists such as CatBones continued to help pioneer and define what is now referred to as the \\"hirez artscene\\", further championing the move away from coded VGA to stand-alone imagery with his impressive artwork. Hirez today implies higher resolutions than before, such as a 1024x768 pixel canvas or larger, greater depth of color, and is created with much more sophisticated and modern software. Underground status Despite the fact that contributors to the artscene can be found worldwide, the scene remains detached from mainstream bbs and internet culture. This can be seen as a result of the artscene's early affiliations with hacker and software piracy (warez) organizations. As early demoscene groups were organized by cracktros coders, artscene members were often found designing the .nfo files detailing warez releases. In addition much of the ansi art provided for warez BBSes was drawn by future members of the artscene. Prior to the popularity of the internet in the 1990s, the most efficient way to distribute software and files across BBSes was via a courier system. Both the warez scene and the artscene utilized this system, and in many cases warez couriers could be found distributing monthly artpacks. In addition to connection that the various underground groups had, a common attitude and relationship between scene members developed. The general belief that \\"newbies are lame\\" and \\"veterans are elite\\", as well as the use of leetspeek, created an environment that was sometimes difficult for new members to enter. In particular, many artsceners' distrust and bitterness towards new America Online users in the 1990s may have eroded the possibility for a wider membership base and audience for the artscene.

The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) is a comprehensive collection of ancient Latin inscriptions. It forms an authoritative source for documenting the surviving epigraphy of classical antiquity. Public and personal inscriptions throw light on all aspects of Roman life and history. The Corpus continues to be updated in new editions and supplements. CIL also refers to the organization within the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities responsible for collecting data on and publishing the Latin inscriptions. It was founded in 1853 by Theodor Mommsen and is the first and major organization aiming at a comprehensive survey. Aim The CIL collects all Latin inscriptions from the whole territory of the Roman Empire, ordering them geographically and systematically. The earlier volumes collected and published authoritative versions of all inscriptions known at the time‚Äîmost of these had been previously published in a wide range of publications. The descriptions include images of the original inscription if available, drawings showing the letters in their original size and position, and an interpretation reconstructing abbreviations and missing words, along with discussion of issues and problems. The language of the CIL is Latin. Beginnings In 1847 a committee was created in Berlin with the aim of publishing an organized collection of Latin inscriptions, which had previously been described piecemeal by hundreds of scholars over the preceding centuries. The leading figure of this committee was Theodor MommsenSee the CIL site under External links below. (who wrote several of the volumes covering Italy). Much of the work involved personal inspections of sites and monuments in an attempt to replicate the original as much as possible. In those cases where a previously cited inscription could no longer be found, the authors tried to get an accurate reading by comparing the versions of the published inscription in the works of previous authors who had seen the original. The first volume appeared in 1853. Current status The CIL presently consists of 17 volumes in about 70 parts, recording approximately 180,000 inscriptions. Thirteen supplementary volumes have plates and special indices. The first volume, in two sections, covered the oldest inscriptions, to the end of the Roman Republic; volumes II to XIV are divided geographically, according to the regions where the inscriptions were found. The other volumes cover other topics. Volume XVII, for instance, is entirely devoted to milestones. A volume XVIII is planned, which will contain the Carmina Latina Epigraphica (Latin verse inscriptions). A two-volume \\"Index of Numbers\\", correlating inscription numbers with volume numbers, was published in 2003.

It is used in some computer algebra systems to find antiderivatives. It is named after the American mathematician Robert Henry Risch, a specialist in computer algebra who developed it in 1968. The algorithm transforms the problem of integration into a problem in algebra. It is based on the form of the function being integrated and on methods for integrating rational functions, radicals, logarithms, and exponential functions. Risch called it a decision procedure, because it is a method for deciding whether a function has an elementary function as an indefinite integral, and if it does, for determining that indefinite integral. The complete description of the Risch algorithm takes over 100 pages.. The Risch‚ÄìNorman algorithm is a simpler, faster, but less powerful variant that was developed in 1976 by Arthur Norman. Description The Risch algorithm is used to integrate elementary functions. These are functions obtained by composing exponentials, logarithms, radicals, trigonometric functions, and the four arithmetic operations (). Laplace solved this problem for the case of rational functions, as he showed that the indefinite integral of a rational function is a rational function and a finite number of constant multiples of logarithms of rational functions. The algorithm suggested by Laplace is usually described in calculus textbooks; as a computer program, it was finally implemented in the 1960s. Liouville formulated the problem that is solved by the Risch algorithm. Liouville proved by analytical means that if there is an elementary solution to the equation then there exist constants and functions and in the field generated by such that the solution is of the form : g = v + \\\\sum_{i Risch developed a method that allows one to consider only a finite set of functions of Liouville's form. The intuition for the Risch algorithm comes from the behavior of the exponential and logarithm functions under differentiation. For the function , where and are differentiable functions, we have : \\\\left(f \\\\cdot e^g\\\\right)^\\\\prime = \\\\left(f^\\\\prime + f\\\\cdot g^\\\\prime\\\\right) \\\\cdot e^g, \\\\, so if were in the result of an indefinite integration, it should be expected to be inside the integral. Also, as : \\\\left(f \\\\cdot(\\\\ln g)^n\\\\right)^\\\\prime = f^\\\\prime \\\\left(\\\\ln g\\\\right)^n + n f \\\\frac{g^\\\\prime}{g} \\\\left(\\\\ln g\\\\right)^{n - 1} then if were in the result of an integration, then only a few powers of the logarithm should be expected. Problem examples Finding an elementary antiderivative is very sensitive to details. For instance, the following algebraic function has an elementary antiderivative:This example was posted by Manuel Bronstein to the Usenet forum comp.soft-sys.math.maple on 24 November 2000. : f(x) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sqrt{x^4 + 10 x^2 - 96 x - 71}}, namely: : F(x) = - \\\\tfrac{1}{8}\\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\left(x^6+15 x^4-80 x^3+27 x^2-528 x+781\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{ x^4+10 x^2-96 x-71} - \\\\left(x^8 + 20 x^6 - 128 x^5 + 54 x^4 - 1408 x^3 + 3124 x^2 + 10001\\\\right) \\\\right) + C. But if the constant term 71 is changed to 72, it is not possible to represent the antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. Some computer algebra systems may here return an antiderivative in terms of non-elementary functions (i.e. elliptic integrals), which are outside the scope of the Risch algorithm. The following is a more complex example that involves both algebraic and transcendental functions:. : f(x) = \\\\frac{x^2+2x+1+ (3x+1)\\\\sqrt{x+\\\\ln x}}{x\\\\,\\\\sqrt{x+\\\\ln x}\\\\left(x+\\\\sqrt{x+\\\\ln x}\\\\right)}. In fact, the antiderivative of this function has a fairly short form: : F(x) = 2 \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x+\\\\ln x} + \\\\ln\\\\left(x+\\\\sqrt{x+\\\\ln x}\\\\right)\\\\right) + C. Implementation Transforming Risch's theoretical algorithm into an algorithm that can be effectively executed by a computer was a complex task which took a long time. The case of the purely transcendental functions (which do not involve roots of polynomials) is relatively easy and was implemented early in most computer algebra systems. The first implementation was done by Joel Moses in Macsyma soon after the publication of Risch's paper.. The case of purely algebraic functions was solved and implemented in Reduce by James H. Davenport.. The general case was solved and implemented in Scratchpad, a precursor of Axiom, by Manuel Bronstein.. Decidability The Risch algorithm applied to general elementary functions is not an algorithm but a semi- algorithm because it needs to check, as a part of its operation, if certain expressions are equivalent to zero (constant problem), in particular in the constant field. For expressions that involve only functions commonly taken to be elementary it is not known whether an algorithm performing such a check exists or not (current computer algebra systems use heuristics); moreover, if one adds the absolute value function to the list of elementary functions, it is known that no such algorithm exists; see Richardson's theorem. Note that this issue also arises in the polynomial division algorithm; this algorithm will fail if it cannot correctly determine whether coefficients vanish identically. Virtually every non-trivial algorithm relating to polynomials uses the polynomial division algorithm, the Risch algorithm included. If the constant field is computable, i.e., for elements not dependent on , the problem of zero-equivalence is decidable, then the Risch algorithm is a complete algorithm. Examples of computable constant fields are and , i.e., rational numbers and rational functions in with rational number coefficients, respectively, where is an indeterminate that does not depend on . This is also an issue in the Gaussian elimination matrix algorithm (or any algorithm that can compute the nullspace of a matrix), which is also necessary for many parts of the Risch algorithm. Gaussian elimination will produce incorrect results if it cannot correctly determine if a pivot is identically zero.

Their own endonyms were Safinim for the country (attested in one inscription and one coin legend) and Safineis for the The language of these endonyms and of the population was the Oscan language. However, not all the Samnites spoke Oscan, and not all the Oscan- speakers lived in Samnium. Ancient geographers were unable to relay a precise definition of Samnium's borders. Moreover, the areas it included vary depending on the time period considered.. \\"The boundaries of Samnium, as of any other country, varied at different times in its history. No ancient writer has left a precise and accurate description of them.\\" The main configurations are the borders it had during the floruit of the Oscan speakers, from about 600 BC to about 290 BC, when it was finally absorbed by the Roman Republic. The original territory of Samnium should not be confused with the later territory of the same name. Rome's first Emperor, Augustus, divided Italy into 11 regions.Listed in the Descriptio Italiae, lost to moderns, but serving as the basis of Pliny the Elder's description of Italy. Although these entities only served administrative purposes, and were identified with the sole numeral, by scholarly convention the Regio IV has been dubbed \\"Samnium\\". Ancient Samnium had actually been split up into three of the Augustan regions.IV, II (\\"Apulia et Calabria\\"), and I (\\"Latium et Campania\\"). Modern Italian language has borrowed the name \\"Sannio\\" to indicate only a small portion of what it once was - informally, the Province of Benevento only. Etymology Etymologically the name Samnium is generally recognized to be a form of the name of the Sabines, who were Umbrians.. From Safinim, Sabinus, Sabellus and Samnis an Indo-European root can be extracted, *-, which becomes Sab- in Latino-Faliscan and Saf- in Osco-Umbrian: Sabini and *Safineis. The eponymous god of the Sabines, Sabus, seems to support this view. The Greek terms, Saunitai and Saunitis, remain outside the group. Nothing is known of their origin. At some point in prehistory, a population speaking a common language extended over both Samnium and Umbria. Salmon conjectures that it was common Italic and puts forward a date of 600 BC, after which the common language began to separate into dialects. This date does not necessarily correspond to any historical or archaeological evidence; developing a synthetic view of the ethnology of proto-historic Italy is an incomplete and ongoing task. The linguist, Julius Pokorny, carries the etymology somewhat further back. Conjecturing that the -a- was altered from an -o- during some prehistoric residence in Illyria he derives the names from an o-grade extension *swo-bho- of an extended e-grade *swe-bho- of the possessive adjective, *s(e)we-, of the reflexive pronoun, *se-, \\"oneself\\" (the source of English self). The result is a set of Indo-European tribal names (if not the endonym of the Indo-Europeans): Germanic Suebi and Semnones, Suiones; Celtic Senones; Slavic Serbs and Sorbs; Italic Sabelli, Sabini, etc., as well as a large number of kinship terms. The general concept is \\"our own kith and kin,\\" Pokorny's \\"von eigener Art,\\" \\"Gesamtheit der eigenen Leute,\\" \\"Liebe,\\" \\"Sippegenossen,\\" \\"Sippenangeh√∂rigen,\\" and the like. under se. Historical geography Samnite soldiers, from a tomb frieze in Nola, Campania, 4th century BCE. Samnium mostly lay on the Apennine area; it was delimited by Latium to the north, by Lucania to the south, by Campania to the west, and by Apulia to the east. The principal cities of the region were Bovaiamom, renamed Bovianum by Latins (today: Bojano or Boiano) and Maleventum (Maloenton in Oscan), which was later renamed Beneventum by the Romans (today: Benevento). For most of their history the Samnites were landlocked, but during a brief period they controlled parts of both coasts of the Italian peninsula. The Samnites were composed of at least four tribes: the Pentri (capital: Bovianum), the Caraceni (principal cities: Cluviae, the modern Casoli, and Juvanum, the ruins of which are spread between Torricella Peligna and Montenerodomo), the Caudini (capital: Caudium, today Montesarchio) and the Hirpini (main cities: Beneventum, Abellinum). They may have later been joined by the Frentani (capital Larinum, the modern Larino). The federal capital of the League they formed was Bovianum, except for a short period between the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, when it was Aquilonia, destroyed by the Romans in 293 BC, whose probable location today is modern Agnone, in Molise; though it has also been identified with Aquilonia, in the Province of Avellino. History The earliest written record of the people is a treaty with the Romans from 354 BC, which set their border at the Liris River. Shortly thereafter the Samnite Wars broke out; they won an important battle against the Roman army in 321 BC, and their imperium reached its peak in 316 BC after further gains from the Romans. By 290 BC, the Romans were able to break the Samnites' power after some hard-fought battles. The Samnites were one of the Italian peoples that allied with King Pyrrhus of Epirus during the Pyrrhic War. After Pyrrhus left for Sicily, the Romans invaded Samnium and were crushed at the Battle of the Cranita hills, but after the defeat of Pyrrhus, the Samnites could not resist on their own and surrendered to Rome. Some of the Samnites joined and aided Hannibal during the Second Punic War, but most stayed loyal. The Samnites and several other Italic people rebelled against Rome and started the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC), after Romans refused to grant them Roman Citizenship. The war lasted almost three years, and resulted in a Roman victory. However, Samnites and other Italic tribes were granted Roman citizenship, to avoid another war. The Samnites supported the Populares in the civil war against Lucius Cornelius Sulla, but unfortunately for them, Sulla ended up winning the war and was declared the dictator of Rome. Sulla ordered all those who went against him to be punished. Thousands of people in Rome and all over Italy were brutally hunted down and killed. Samnites, who were one of the most prominent supporters of the Populares, were punished so severely that it was recorded \\"some of their cities have now dwindled into villages, some indeed being entirely deserted.\\" Samnites did not play any prominent role in history after this, and they eventually became Latinized and assimilated into the Roman World Strabo, Geography, Book V, Section 4.11.

History  The party initially proved successful and had members elected to the Chamber of Representatives (five) and the Senate (two) of the Belgian Federal Parliament in 1961. The party continued to grow in stature and reached the 11.0% at the national level in 1978 elections, gaining 21 representatives. Ideologically, the Volksunie preferred to position itself around the centre and saw itself as a coalition of various shades of Flemish thought as a big tent party with the objective of pursuing further autonomy, national identity and political freedom for the Flemish region. The party contained members from the left, right and centre ground of the political spectrum and different from other Belgian parties by putting Flemish nationalism at the forefront of its image and platform as opposed to a right or left of centre identity. The acceptance of federalism in place of separatism by the VU in the 1970s did not sit well with the party's right-wing and separatist wing, and a split became inevitable, particularly after the party entered the coalition government of Leo Tindemans (CVP, Christian-Democrat). The right-wing separatist and national conservative faction broke away and organized itself in the Vlaams Blok, becoming a much stronger political force and surpassing Volksunie at the beginning of the 1990s (6.6% against VU's 5.9% in 1991 elections). The Volksunie was a member of the European Free Alliance. Volksunie continued its decline (5.6% in 1999 elections against the 9.9% of the Blok), with the internal divisions between the right-wing and left-wing members re-emerging in 2001. The right wing won a large plurality at a party referendum, with 47 percent. However, while it inherited Volksunie's structure, it did not take the Volksunie name due to falling short of a majority and not being allowed to use the party name under Belgian electoral law. Instead, it reconstituted itself as a new party, and re-registered itself as the New Flemish Alliance (Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie, or N-VA). The left wing broke off and became Spirit, while the liberal members joined the Flemish Liberals and Democrats. The two parties proceeded to form new electoral alliances, known in Belgium as cartels, with the N-VA allying with Christian Democratic and Flemish and Spirit with the Socialist Party - Different. These cartels broke up in 2008 as the parties continued their decline, until the N-VA experienced a sudden resurgence in 2009, eventually becoming the largest party in Flanders and going on to participate as a coalition partner in the Belgian government, while Spirit ceased to exist, merging with Groen.

He is best remembered as a memoirist of the October Revolution of 1917 and as the leader of one of the primary opposition movements inside the Russian Communist Party during the 1920s. Biography =Early years= Alexander Shliapnikov was born August 30, 1885, in Murom, Russian Empire to a poor family of the Old Believer religion. His father died when he was a small child. Shliapnikov began factory work at age thirteen and became a revolutionary at age sixteen. =Revolutions= 1905 He joined the Bolsheviks in 1903. He was arrested and imprisoned at various times for his radical political activities, including his involvement in the 1905 revolution. Shliapnikov left Russia in 1908 and continued his revolutionary activities in Western Europe, where he also worked in factories and was a devoted trade unionist. 1917 Shliapnikov returned to Russia in 1916. He, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Petr Zalutskii were the senior Bolsheviks in Petrograd at the time of the February Revolution in 1917. More prominent figures such as Vladimir Lenin, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Joseph Stalin were abroad or in Siberian exile when the February Revolution began. In 1917, Shliapnikov became a member of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. He also was elected to chairmanship of the Petrograd Metalworkers' Union and later of the All-Russian Metalworkers' Union. He led negotiations of a wage agreement between Petrograd metalworkers and factory owners in 1917. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn describes him as the main leader of the \\"Communist Party\\" of Russia in the years before the Revolution. =After the revolution= Sergei Medvedev (1926) Following the October Revolution and the Bolshevik seizure of power, Shliapnikov was appointed Commissar of Labor. Shliapnikov supported a coalition government composed of left socialist parties, which never came to fruition, with the parties clashing over priorities. He played an important role in evacuating industry from Petrograd, as the Germans approached in 1918. As Commissar of Labor, he helped draft important directives on workers' control of industry and nationalization of industry and he staffed government bureaucracies with staff from trade unions. In the summer of 1918, he went to the south of Russia on a mission to gather food for the population of the Bolshevik-controlled cities of central Russia. In December 1918 Shliapnikov was replaced as Commissar of Labor by Vasili Schmidt and then served as Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Caspian-Caucasian Front in the Russian Civil War. He also served in the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front during the Civil War. During the Civil War, Shliapnikov began to criticize the increasing tendency of the Russian Communist Party and Soviet government to rely on authoritarian measures to enforce policies towards industry and industrial workers. To Shliapnikov, denial of workers' right to participate in economic decision-making was a step away from the goals of the 1917 revolution. =Opposition leader= Alexander Shliapnikov (on left) with Leonid Krasin in 1924 Shliapnikov became leader of the Workers' Opposition movement inside the Russian Communist Party. Alexandra Kollontai was a mentor and advocate of the group, which was composed of leaders of trade unions and industry who were all former industrial workers, usually metalworkers. This movement advocated the role of workers, organized in trade unions, in managing the economy and the political party. The Russian Communist Party leaders succeeded in suppressing the Workers' Opposition and in 1921‚Äì22 finally subordinated trade union leadership to the Party. In 1921, Shliapnikov was forced out of his elected post as chairman of the Metalworkers' Union.Allen (\\"Early dissent\\"), p. 25 In 1922, Shliapnikov and some other trade-unionists from within and outside the Workers' Opposition, supported by Alexandra Kollontai, presented an appeal, called the Letter of the Twenty-Two, to the Communist International Executive, requesting that the Comintern help heal a \\"rift\\" within the Russian Communist Party between Party leaders and workers. Party leaders and Party-controlled media condemned the appeal. Two of the signatories of the appeal were expelled from the Party, but Shliapnikov, Kollontai, and Sergei Medvedev narrowly escaped expulsion.Allen (\\"Early dissent\\"), passim. Shliapnikov turned to writing his memoirs and held jobs in metals import and economic planning institutions. The Party Central Control Commission investigated him and Sergei Medvedev in 1926 and in 1930 for alleged factionalism in connection with the formation of oppositionist groups among workers in Baku and Omsk. In 1930, the Party Politburo forced Shliapnikov to publish a public confession of \\"political errors\\" in writing his memoirs of the revolution. This was not the same as a confession of political errors committed by him since the revolution. =Death and legacy= Shliapnikov was expelled from the Communist Party in 1933 and imprisoned in 1935 for alleged political crimes. Charged under Article 58 of the Soviet Criminal Code, he did not confess guilt or implicate others. Nevertheless, he was found guilty, based on others' testimony, and he was executed on September 2, 1937.Allen (Alexander Shlyapnikov), p. 363. His wife was also arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison, while their three children were dispatched to separate orphanages, being only later permitted to reunite. In 1948‚Äì1951 all three children, who were not older than 20, and their mother were arrested during a new wave of terror and sentenced to prison camp in Siberia, the only female child, Irina, getting her sentence immediately changed to internal exile in Krasnoyarsk. They were all released in the mid-1950s. Shliapnikov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1963 and restored to membership in the Communist Party in 1988.Allen (Alexander Shlyapnikov), pp. 366‚Äì367.

He served as the head coach at Denison University (1946‚Äì1948), Miami University in Oxford, Ohio (1949‚Äì1950), and Ohio State University (1951‚Äì1978), compiling a career college football record of 238 wins, 72 losses, and 10 ties. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1983. During his 28 seasons as the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes football program, Hayes's teams won five national championships (1954, 1957, 1961, 1968, 1970), captured 13 Big Ten Conference titles, and amassed a record of 205‚Äì61‚Äì10. Over the last decade of his coaching tenure at Ohio State, Hayes's Buckeye squads faced off in a fierce rivalry against the Michigan Wolverines coached by Bo Schembechler, a former player under and assistant coach to Hayes. During that stretch in the Michigan‚ÄìOhio State football rivalry, dubbed \\"The Ten Year War\\", Hayes and Schembechler's teams won or shared the Big Ten Conference crown every season and usually each placed in the national rankings. Despite his great achievements at Ohio State, Hayes's coaching career ended ignominiously when he was fired from his position as head coach after punching Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman for intercepting an Ohio State pass with two minutes left on the clock in the 1978 Gator Bowl. Early years A native of Clifton, Ohio, Hayes was the youngest of three children born to Wayne B. and Effie (n√©e Hupp) Hayes. He played center at Newcomerstown High School in Newcomerstown, Ohio. At Denison University, he played tackle under coach Tom Rogers, and was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. After graduating from Denison in 1935, Hayes went on to serve as an assistant at two Ohio high schools: Mingo Junction in 1935‚Äì1936 and New Philadelphia in 1937. When New Philadelphia head coach John Brickels left to accept another position, Hayes was elevated to the head coaching position, where he put together a 17‚Äì2‚Äì1 record in his first two seasons before enduring a 1‚Äì9 record in 1940. Hayes enlisted in the United States Navy in July 1941, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander during World War II. He commanded PC 1251 in the Palau Islands invasion and the destroyer-escort USS Rinehart in both the Atlantic and Pacific operations. As World War II was near its end, and Hayes' alma mater, Denison University, was pursuing plans to reinstate its football program (which had been suspended during the war), it contacted former head coach Rogers (also in the Navy) about rejoining the program as head coach. Rogers declined, but recommended that his former team captain, Hayes, should be named the next head coach. Denison was able to locate and give Hayes an offer, which he accepted, minutes before his Navy ship was to begin the voyage through the Panama Canal -- meaning Hayes would have been incommunicado for an extended period of time. Coaching at Denison and Miami University Upon returning to Denison in 1946, Hayes had a hard first year, winning only 2 games, over Capital and the season finale against Wittenberg. However, that victory sparked a 19-game winning streak, a surge that propelled him into the head coaching position at Miami University. Miami is recognized as the \\"Cradle of Coaches\\" because of its history of outstanding coaches starting their careers there, such as Paul Brown, Ara Parseghian, Weeb Ewbank, Bill Mallory, Sid Gillman, Randy Walker, and Bo Schembechler. Gillman was Hayes' immediate predecessor at Miami before Gillman moved down the road to coach at the University of Cincinnati, which was then Miami's chief rival. Hayes and Gillman maintained a sparkling feud between themselves, combining mutual distaste for the other's coaching style, and because they were in recruiting competition in the same general area. In his second year with the Miami Redskins, Hayes led the 1950 team to an appearance in the Salad Bowl, where they defeated Arizona State. That success led him to accept the Ohio State head coaching position on February 18, 1951, in a controversial decision after the university rejected the applications of other more well-known coaches, including former Buckeyes' head coach Paul Brown, incumbent Buckeye assistant Harry Strobel, and Missouri head coach Don Faurot.Lombardo, op.cit. pp.84-85 Ohio State Hayes with fullback Dick Doyle and assistant coach Ernie Godfrey, 1952 As head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, Hayes led his teams to a 205‚Äì61‚Äì10 record (.761), including three consensus national championships (1954,1957 and 1968), two other non-consensus national titles (1961 and 1970), 13 Big Ten conference championships, and eight Rose Bowl appearances. Hayes was a three-time winner of The College Football Coach of the Year Award, now known as the Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant Award, and was \\"the subject of more varied and colorful anecdotal material than any other coach past or present, including fabled Knute Rockne\\", according to biographer Jerry Brondfield. Hayes' basic coaching philosophy was that \\"nobody could win football games unless they regarded the game positively and would agree to pay the price that success demands of a team.\\" His conservative style of football (especially on offense) was often described as \\"three yards and a cloud of dust\\"‚Äîin other words, a \\"crunching, frontal assault of muscle against muscle, bone upon bone, will against will.\\" The basic, bread-and-butter play in Hayes' playbook was a fullback off-guard run or a tailback off tackle play. Hayes was often quoted as saying \\"only three things can happen when you pass (a completion, an incompletion, and an interception) and two of them are bad.\\" In spite of this apparent willingness to avoid change, Hayes became one of the first major college head coaches to recruit African-American players, including Jim Parker, who played both offensive and defensive tackle on Hayes' first national championship team in 1954. While Hayes was not the first to recruit African-Americans to Ohio State, he was the first to recruit and start African-Americans in large numbers there and to hire African-American assistant coaches. Another Hayes' recruit, Archie Griffin, was the only two- time Heisman Trophy winner in seven decades of selections. Altogether, Hayes had 58 players earn All-America honors under his tutelage. Many notable football coaches, such as Lou Holtz, Bill Arnsparger, Bill Mallory, Dick Crum, Bo Schembechler, Doyt Perry, Ara Parseghian and Woody's successor, Earle Bruce, served as his assistants at various times. Hayes often used illustrations from historical events to make a point in his coaching and teaching. When Hayes was first hired to be the head coach at Ohio State, he was also made a \\"full professor of physical education\\", having earned an M.A. degree in educational administration from Ohio State in 1948. The classes he taught were usually full, and he was called \\"Professor Hayes\\" by students. Hayes also taught mandatory English and vocabulary classes to his freshman football players. One of his students was a basketball player named Bobby Knight, who later became a legendary basketball coach. During his time at Ohio State, Hayes' relationships with students faculty members were particularly good. Even those members of the faculty who believed that the role of intercollegiate athletics was growing out of control respected Hayes personally for his commitment to academics, the standards of integrity with which he ran his program, and the genuine enthusiasm he brought to his hobby as an amateur historian. Hayes often ate lunch or dinner at the university's faculty club, interacting with faculty and administrators. As a coach and an educator, Hayes was one of the first to use the motion picture as a teaching and learning tool. He was also memorable in that he could often be seen walking across campus, taking the time to visit with students. When talking to young people, Hayes treated all with respect, without regard to race or socio- economic class. This behavior was helpful to Ohio State in quelling the violence and damage from anti-war demonstrations that other college campuses suffered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He took the time to communicate with student leaders. Then-team quarterback Rex Kern said, \\"Woody was out there on the Oval with the protesters, and he'd grab a bullhorn and tell the students to express their beliefs but not be destructive. He believed in Nixon, and he believed in the Establishment, but he wasn't afraid to talk to the students. He wanted to stay close to the action.\\"Lombardo, op.cit. pp.195-197 Hayes was considered one of the few authority figures that students then had respect for. His enthusiasm for coaching and winning was such that many across the nation consider the following maxim to be true: \\"What Vince Lombardi was to professional football, Woody Hayes was to college football.\\" During his tenure at Ohio State, Hayes joked that he considered himself to be Notre Dame's best recruiter because if he could not convince a recruit to come to Ohio State instead of Michigan he would try to steer the recruit to Notre Dame, whom Ohio State did not play. While Hayes' public stance was that he refused to play Notre Dame because he was afraid of polarizing the Catholic population in Ohio, Notre Dame's long-time athletic director Edward \\"Moose\\" Krause said that Hayes had told him that Hayes liked having Michigan as the only tough game on the Ohio State schedule and that having the Buckeyes play Notre Dame would detract from that. Despite Hayes' apparent fear of playing more than one \\"tough\\" game a year, Ohio State still managed to schedule regular-season games with Nebraska, Washington, Southern California, UCLA, and Oklahoma during his tenure. After losses or ties, Hayes conducted locker room interviews while naked. A journalist from his tenure noted, \\"He was an ugly guy so it would clear the locker room out pretty fast.\\"Leonard Downie Jr. regrettably recalls Woody Hayes holding interviews while naked, Cleveland Plain Dealer, February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009.Richard Oviatt, Washington Post editor Leonard Downie Jr. talks past, future , The Lantern, February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009. Controversies In 1959, following a 17‚àí0 loss to USC, Hayes threw a punch at Los Angeles Examiner sportswriter Al Bine, but missed, and punched the brother of Pasadena Independent sports editor Bob Shafer in the back instead. In a May 1965 meeting of Big Ten Conference athletic directors and coaches, Hayes nearly started a fight with Iowa's athletic director, Forest Evashevski, before being restrained. In 1968, Hayes' team won a game against rival Michigan, 50‚Äì14. Late in that game, Ohio State held a commanding 44‚Äì14 advantage and scored one final touchdown. Rather than taking the more common extra point kick, Hayes instead opted for a two-point conversion, but was unsuccessful, leading many football fans to believe that Hayes was running up the score. When asked later why he went for two points, Hayes said, \\"Because they wouldn't let me go for three.‚Äù Prior to the 1973 Rose Bowl, Hayes shoved a camera into the face of a news photographer. As a result, Hayes was suspended for three games, fined $2,000, and left California with a subpoena. In 1977, a late fumble at Michigan caused him to charge at ABC cameraman Mike Freedman, who recorded his frustration; Hayes was ejected, put on probation by the Big Ten Conference, and fined $2,000. =1962 Rose Bowl vote= In the 1961 season, Ohio State won the Big Ten championship, qualifying automatically for the Rose Bowl. At the time, the Big Ten Conference rules stated that the school's Faculty Council must officially approve of the trip. In this unusual development, the Ohio State Faculty Council voted 28 to 25 against the 1962 Rose Bowl trip, prompted by the head of a university alumni group, on the grounds that the school's academic reputation was suffering because of over-emphasis on the football team. Other reports stated that the bid was declined because Ohio State had already beaten their would-be Rose Bowl opponent, UCLA, during the regular season. The decision sparked minor rioting on the Ohio State Campus and in the Columbus area. The Columbus Dispatch published the names, addresses, and phone numbers of those Faculty Council Members who voted against the trip as well as the amount of university money that they spent on the trips. While Hayes was diplomatic with some faculty members who voted against the trip and urged the students to cease complaining, he did not spare his criticism of the alumni club president who led the charge against accepting the bowl bid.Lombardo, op.cit. pp.142‚Äì145 =Comments on the My Lai Massacre= Speaking at a football banquet in 1969, Hayes spoke about the recently revealed My Lai Massacre. He stated that the Vietnamese men in My Lai deserved to die, \\"and I wouldn't be so sure those women were innocent. The children are obviously innocent ‚Äì if they are less than five.\\" =Confrontation with Jerry Markbreit= Late in the 1971 rivalry game against Michigan in Ann Arbor, furious over what he thought was a missed defensive pass interference foul committed by Thom Darden of Michigan, Hayes stormed onto the field, launched a profanity-laced tirade at referee Jerry Markbreit, and tore up the sideline markers, receiving a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Hayes then threw the penalty flag into the crowd, began destroying the yard markers, and threw the first-down marker into the ground like a javelin before being restrained by Buckeyes team officials; Hayes was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected. Hayes was suspended for one game and fined $1,000. =1978 Gator Bowl incident and dismissal= On December 29, 1978, the Buckeyes played in the Gator Bowl against Clemson. Late in the fourth quarter, Clemson was leading Ohio State 17‚Äì15. Freshman quarterback Art Schlichter managed to get Ohio State into field goal range. On third and 5 at the Clemson 24-yard line with 2:30 left and the clock running, Hayes called a pass rather than a run, because Schlichter was having a great game up to that point. Schlichter's next pass was intercepted by Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman, who returned it toward the Ohio State sideline, where he was run out of bounds. After Bauman stood up facing the OSU sideline Hayes punched him in the throat, triggering a bench-clearing brawl.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEVJyf0ft3I Hayes stormed onto the field and was abusive towards the referee. When one of Hayes' own players, offensive lineman, Ken Fritz, tried to intervene, Hayes turned on him and had to be restrained by defensive coordinator George Hill.Clemson 1978 Gator Bowl: The end for Woody Hayes, 247Sports, Steve Helwagen, Dec. 25, 2016. The Buckeyes were assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for Hayes' attack on Bauman and his abuse towards the referee. Bauman was not injured by Hayes' punch and shrugged the incident off. Even though the game was being telecast by ABC, announcer Keith Jackson neither saw nor commented about the punch. Co- announcer Ara Parseghian did not comment either. (At the time, all non-press box cameras were operated remotely from another site, and Jackson allegedly did not actually witness the punch, his view of the sidelines being blocked by the upper tier of the stadium). After the game, Ohio State Athletic Director Hugh Hindman, who had played for Hayes at Miami University and had been an assistant under him for seven years, privately confronted Hayes in the Buckeye locker room. He said that he intended to tell school president Harold Enarson about what happened, and strongly implied that Hayes had coached his last game at Ohio State. After a heated exchange, Hindman said that he then offered Hayes a chance to resign, but Hayes refused, saying, \\"That would make it too easy for you. You had better go ahead and fire me.\\" Hindman then met with Enarson at a country club near Jacksonville, and the two agreed that Hayes had to go.Scorecard. Sports Illustrated, January 8, 1979. The next morning, Hindman told Hayes that he had been fired. A press conference was held at the hotel where the team had been staying. The team returned to Columbus around noon, and Hayes left the airport in a police car. Regarding Hayes' dismissal, Enarson said that \\"there isn't a university or athletic conference in this country that would permit a coach to physically assault a college athlete.\\"The New York Times, Dec 31, 1978, pg.S1 After the incident, Hayes reflected on his career by saying, \\"Nobody despises to lose more than I do. That's got me into trouble over the years, but it also made a man of mediocre ability into a pretty good coach.\\" About two months after the incident, Hayes called Bauman in his dorm room, but did not apologize for his previous attack on him. Earle Bruce succeeded Hayes as Ohio State's head coach. Many years later, Leonard Downie, Jr., former executive editor of The Washington Post and student journalist at Ohio State, said he regretted not reporting an incident in the 1960s where Hayes instructed a player to take off his helmet and then hit him in the head. According to the 1994 HBO documentary American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory, Hindman had placed Hayes on notice at the beginning of the 1978 season, not just for the swing at the ABC cameraman during the 1977 Michigan game, but also for hitting a player during a practice. In his 1989 autobiography, Michigan's Bo Schembechler wrote that he believed Hayes, who was diabetic and may have had a high blood sugar level, didn't believe he struck Bauman. Schembechler also pointed out that Hayes had maintained that all he was trying to do was grab the ball away.Schembechler & Albom. p. 82. Before and after the dismissal incident, Hayes was a professor of Military History at Ohio State. His office was in the ROTC building, Converse Hall, across the street from Ohio Stadium. For the remainder of his years at OSU, he continued to teach and mentor students. Final days and death On March 11, 1987, Hayes was clearly in failing health when he had someone drive him in his pickup truck to Dayton to introduce Bo Schembechler, who was speaking at a banquet. Organizers had tried to discourage Hayes from attending, but Hayes insisted. He gave a lengthy introduction to Schembechler and then stayed to hear him speak before being driven back home.Schembechler & Albom. p. 84. The next morning, March 12, Hayes's wife Anne found him unconscious in his bed at the couple's home.Burt A. Folkart, Woody Hayes, Buckeye Coach 28 Years, Dies, Los Angeles Times (March 12, 1987).

He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. At Hayes's funeral at First Community Church in Grandview, Ohio on March 17, 1987, former president Richard Nixon delivered the eulogy before a crowd of 1,400, acknowledging the friendship that had begun between the two during his second term as vice president. Having met Hayes at a reception following a Buckeye win over Iowa in 1957, Nixon recalled, \\"I wanted to talk about football. Woody wanted to talk about foreign policy. And you know Woody‚Äîwe talked about foreign policy.\\"Nixon, Richard M. \\"A Tribute to Woody Hayes\\", March 17, 1987, quoted in Columbus Dispatch, March 12, 2012 The following day, more than 15,000 people took part in a memorial service at Ohio Stadium. Hayes's commitment to academics at Ohio State was evidenced by his request that donations from his family, friends, and supporters be made to the academic side of the university. Following his death and in keeping with his wishes, the Wayne Woodrow Hayes Chair in National Security Studies was established at Ohio State's Mershon Center for International Security Studies. Professor John Mueller currently holds the chair. In November 1987, the university dedicated the new Woody Hayes Athletic Center in his memory. Personal life Hayes married the former Anne Gross in 1942. Anne Hayes was a formidable and popular woman in her own right, who used to jokingly say at numerous sports banquets, \\"Divorce Woody? Never! But there were plenty of times I wanted to murder him!\\"Lombardo, op.cit. p.40 The couple had one son, Steven, who went on to become a lawyer and judge. Coincidentally, the younger Hayes was assigned to the 2003 trial of former Ohio State standout Maurice Clarett. =World War II movie host= Because of his knowledge of military history and ongoing popularity, Hayes in the early 1980s hosted the broadcast of six World War II films for WBNS-TV in Columbus, which has served as the official outlet of Ohio State sports media programming for years, including the football coach's shows. Among the movies broadcast were Patton, Midway, The Wackiest Ship in the Army, The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel, and Tora! Tora! Tora! Hayes also gave salty historical perspectives related to each movie. Hayes' segments, depending upon the movie, were taped in such locations as Fort Knox, West Point, the , and Stuttgart, Germany, where he interviewed Manfred Rommel, Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and the son of Erwin Rommel.

He is best known as the former bass guitarist of the alternative rock band Jane's Addiction, with whom he recorded two studio albums. He is currently the touring and recording bassist for Garbage, whom he joined in 2005 as a sideman. A core member of Jane's Addiction during its initial lifespan, Avery co-founded the band in 1985 with frontman Perry Farrell, and recorded two studio albums, Nothing's Shocking (1988) and Ritual de lo Habitual (1990), before the band's acrimonious break-up in 1991. Following Jane's Addiction's dissolution, Avery and guitarist Dave Navarro formed Deconstruction with drummer Michael Murphy, releasing one studio album in 1994. The following year, Avery began a solo project named Polar Bear, which he focused on between 1995 and 2000. Declining to take part in Jane's Addition's 1997 and 2001 reunions, Avery eventually rejoined the band in 2008. The original core line- up of the band embarked on an extensive co-headlining tour with Nine Inch Nails, with Avery ultimately departing in 2010 due to ongoing tensions with Farrell. Alongside his work with Jane's Addiction, Avery is a former member of Alanis Morissette's backing band, and has been a touring and session musician for Garbage since 2005, contributing to the albums, Not Your Kind of People (2012) and Strange Little Birds (2016). Avery unofficially joined The Smashing Pumpkins to work on new material in the early days of their reunion, and was briefly a member of the rock supergroup Giraffe Tongue Orchestra. In 2013, Avery joined Nine Inch Nails in preparation for their extensive Twenty Thirteen Tour, before ultimately parting ways with the project. To date, Avery has released two solo studio albums under his own name, Help Wanted (2008) and LIFE.TIME. (2013).  Biography  Eric Avery was born in Los Angeles, California. His father is the actor Brian Avery, perhaps best known for playing Carl Smith (who Dustin Hoffman famously keeps from marrying Katharine Ross) in The Graduate. Avery and Dave Navarro met as classmates at St. Paul the Apostle Grammar School in West Los Angeles, a Catholic parochial school founded by the Paulist Father. Eric went on to St. Monica High School of Santa Monica, California, and Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. Dave was classmates at Notre Dame with Stephen Perkins. Stephen met Eric's sister, Rebecca Avery, and they dated. Rebecca suggested that Eric and Perry Farrell audition Stephen as the drummer for Jane's Addiction after Perry and Eric cofounded the band. Avery kept a fairly low profile after the first demise of Jane's Addiction, participating in the Deconstruction project with Navarro immediately after Jane's Addiction's breakup, but initially declining invitations for Jane's reunions. \\"I've asked him,\\" said Farrell before 2001's Jubilee Tour, \\"but he says he wants no part of it. What else can you say but, Good luck to ya?\\" Avery has recorded tracks for, toured with and briefly dated Alanis Morissette, as well as creating another side project, Polar Bear, in 1994. He was once suggested as the replacement bassist for Tool by former Jane's Addiction and then-current Tool manager Ted Gardner. Eric declined the invitation, saying he wanted to concentrate on Polar Bear. As seen in the film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, Avery auditioned for Metallica, after the departure of bassist Jason Newsted. The role didn't quite fit Avery and the band went with Ozzy Osbourne and Suicidal Tendencies bassist Robert Trujillo. Avery toured with the band Garbage to promote 2005's Bleed Like Me. Avery has also performed with Peter Murphy, on tour and on 2004's Unshattered. Avery worked briefly with the revived Smashing Pumpkins, but ultimately did not join the band. He was not paid for his work, but said the sessions were a lot of fun: \\"I went into [the Pumpkins] with the same mentality I took with me when I auditioned for Metallica ‚Äì I expected to have a good story to tell my wife. I had no expectations. I had heard nothing but bad things about working with Billy, but I went, and I found it to be a really inspiring time.\\" Billy Corgan ended up playing bass on what would become 2007's Zeitgeist and hired Ginger Reyes for live performances. In 2007, he contributed original music to the feature film documentary The 11th Hour. He also released his debut solo album Help Wanted in April 2008 through Dangerbird Records. He finally performed with Jane's Addiction ‚Äì for the first time since 1991 ‚Äì at the NME Awards in 2008. Jane's played secret club shows in October and November 2008. On March 19, 2009, at South by Southwest Music festival in Austin, the quartet performed a 45-minute set at an abandoned Safeway grocery store. Jane's Addiction's official website was updated in February 2009 stating that there was to be another club show soon. Photos of Avery, Perkins and Navarro, taken by Trent Reznor, appeared on Nine Inch Nails' official site, which led to speculation that Reznor was helping Jane's record new material. The relationship led to the booking of the \\"NIN/JA\\" (Nine Inch Nails/Jane's Addiction) tour, on which Avery played, and which evoked the first Lollapalooza tour of 1991, starring Jane's and Nine Inch Nails. On March 1, 2010, after a 10-date rescheduled tour in Australia, Avery stated on his Twitter page: \\"the janes addiction experiment is at an end.\\" Rumors were already spreading around a few weeks before, as Duff McKagan was said to be the new bassist for Jane's, but Avery had kept his position for the remaining few dates of the 2009/2010 tour. In February 2012, Justin Meldal-Johnsen commented on the talkbass.com forum that Avery would be joining Garbage on their upcoming tour. In early May 2012 Garbage uploaded a video from their rehearsal, performing the song \\"Battle in Me\\", with Avery playing bass. Avery has since performed in the two Garbage tours that followed, the band's 20th anniversary tourEx-Jane's Addiction Bassist Eric Avery Returns As Garbage's Bassist and the one for the album Strange Little Birds, in which Avery plays bass in six tracks.Garbage Album Features Two Guest Bassists Avery released his second solo album, entitled LIFE.TIME., on February 15, 2013. On February 25, 2013, Trent Reznor named Avery as the new touring bassist of Nine Inch Nails. Avery was slated to perform in the Twenty Thirteen Tour from Summer 2013 into 2014, but announced his withdrawal on May 15, 2013, stating that after a year travelling with Garbage he did not feel like going on another extended tour. Style A self-taught bassist, Avery has singled Peter Hook of Joy Division and New Order as his major influence on bass playing,Eric Avery: Reverse Engineering considering that British bassists were deeper with the instrument as \\"American rock bass is kick drum, it's just kick drum and then the root note of what the guitar player is doing.\\" In Jane's Addiction, Avery stated that in the early phases the basslines would end up as a replacement rhythm guitar, \\"sort of built on that so Dave can riff on it and Stephen also can riff on it\\". On his solo career, Avery only played the bass at the final stages of Help Wanted, instead \\"focused on gadgets and keyboards and guitars and vocals and lyrics and other things like that\\". While playing with Garbage, Avery was for the first time \\"playing a more traditional bass role in a rock band\\" as his bass would only try to match Butch Vig's drumming. \\"Nothing's Shocking influenced me a lot, especially with what Eric Avery proposed from the bass,\\" says Nick Oliveri, of Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss and Mondo Generator. \\"Eric had written the music on his own, the guitars and the drums came later. So he inspired me on that side\\" John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers stated on the Stadium Arcadium commentary that his guitar playing style is influenced by Avery's spacious and heavily melodic playing.

It provides the connection between the cyclist's foot or shoe and the crank allowing the leg to turn the bottom bracket spindle and propel the bicycle's wheels. A pedal usually consists of a spindle that threads into the end of the crank, and a body on which the foot rest is attached, that is free to rotate on bearings with respect to the spindle. Pedals were initially attached to cranks connecting directly to the driven (usually front) wheel. The safety bicycle, as it is known today, came into being when the pedals were attached to a crank driving a sprocket that transmitted power to the driven wheel by means of a roller chain. Types Just as bicycles come in many varieties, there are different types of pedals to support different types of cycling. =Flat and platform= Wellgo DMR V8 Copy pedal Traditionally, platform pedals were pedals with a relatively large flat area for the foot to rest on, in contrast to the quill pedal which had very little surface area. One form of the platform pedal had a large flat top area and flat bottom for use with toe clips and toe straps. They were designed for greater comfort when using shoes with less than rigid soles. They typically had a smaller cutaway underside giving greater cornering clearance, which was often needed for track cycling. They were often marketed as being more aerodynamic than conventional quill pedals. Attaching the shoes to the pedals gives the user more control over the pedal movements. There are two methods for attaching a cyclist's shoes to their pedals: toe clips ‚Äì a basket-and-strap device which hold the foot in place ‚Äì and so-called clipless pedals, where specialized shoes with built-in bindings attach to compatible pedals. In mountain biking (MTB) and BMX, platform pedals typically refer to any flat pedal without a cage. BMX riders typically use plastic pedals made of nylon, polycarbonate, or carbon reinforced plastic, although aluminum alloy, and magnesium are not uncommon pedal body materials. Mountain bikers tend to use aluminum or magnesium because of the necessary use of metal studs to offer grip while the pedals are wet, muddy and slippery. BMXers tend to prefer platforms to cage pedals because they offer more support and grip for flexible \\"skate\\" shoes by using short metal studs. Cage pedals are more popular in the low end mountain bike range. In general, cage pedals are uncommon in all types of biking, although there is a niche market within mountain biking. Platform pedals are available in a wide variety of types and prices, ranging from disposable plastic units used for test rides on new bicycles to high-end downhill models. Budget models may be made of steel or aluminum and incorporate reflectors for safer riding on streets at night, in addition to complying with some traffic laws. Less expensive platform pedals are generally considered disposable and cannot be rebuilt when worn out. More expensive platform pedals for the mountain bike market are available with replaceable metal traction pins and cartridge bearings. Lightweight pedals intended for freeride and downhill cycling have been made from exotic metals such as magnesium. Toe clips typically are generally not installed on this type of pedal because they are considered unsafe by some MTB and BMX riders. In downhill racing, the extra power and grip offered by clipped pedals is utilized at the risk of clipped in crashing in which the bicycle can potentially stay attached to the foot of the victim. However, fixed gear riders have started using fabric straps instead. =Quill= Bicycle pedal, quill road type, with toe clip and toe strap (1970s) The quill pedal is a common pedal system on bicycles. It consists of a main axle section that is attached to the bicycle crank arm and contains extensions from the axle to which parallel cage plates are attached at the front and rear of the pedal. In order to utilize the quill pedal, the cyclist pushes his foot against the platform formed by the parallel cage plates. To improve the performance of the quill pedal toe clips were added. The toe clip is a thin metal or plastic attachment to the front cage of the pedal. The toe clip is shaped like the toe of a shoe and its function is to prevent a cyclist's shoe from slipping off the pedal during the forward pedaling motion. A further enhancement of the quill pedal was modifying the toe clip to allow a strap and buckle to go around or through both the pedal and the toe clip to encircle the cyclist's foot on the top of the pedal. This strap is generally made of leather or nylon. Mikashima track pedal To further improve the quill pedal's efficiency a \\"cleat\\" was developed. This cleat consists of a small metal or plastic attachment to the cyclist's shoe. The cleat is slotted and is adapted to engage a quill section of the bicycle pedal. The use of the slotted cleat enhances a cyclist's ability over that provided by toe clips and strap, enabling for greater pedaling efficiency. Although quill pedals can be used with smoothed-soled cycling shoes or ordinary shoes, they were designed to be used with cycling shoes which had a slotted shoeplate attached to its sole. The disadvantage with this system is that to remove the shoe from the pedal a rider had to reach down and loosen the strap by hand or leave the toe strap loose and thus give up some efficiency. This type of pedal and pedal setup was common for racing cyclists until the mid to late 1980s. Quill pedals are sometimes said to be named for the quill or \\"pick up tab\\" on the rear of the pedal. The weight of the toe clip and strap would make the pedal hang upside down, and the rider would tap the quill with their shoe to flip the pedal over so the shoe could be inserted into the pedal. The main difference between track, road, and touring quill pedals is width. Track pedals are narrow and the front and back plates of the cage are separate, road being a little wider with a one piece cage in a shape of a sideways \\"U\\", and touring being the widest to allow for comfort when used with wider, non-racing shoes during longer rides. While quill pedals can be used for mountain biking, the use of clips here is dangerous as they do not grip well. Cage pedals built for mountain biking are typically serrated so that even when muddied, the pedals can be gripped well by any flat shoe. Shimano SPD system =Clipless pedals= LOOK road pedals Eggbeater pedal with cleat from Crankbrothers, designed for mountain bikes Clipless pedals (also clip-in or step-in) require a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a mechanism in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most clipless pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although in some cases the locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of the pedal. Clipless refers to the toe clip (cage) having been replaced by a locking mechanism and not to platform pedals which would normally not have toe clips. The clipless pedal was invented by Charles Hanson in 1895. It allowed the rider to twist the shoe to lock and unlock and had rotational float (the freedom to rotate the shoe slightly to prevent joint strain). The M71 was a clipless pedal designed by Cino Cinelli and produced by his company in 1971. It used a plastic shoe cleat which slid into grooves in the pedal and locked in place with a small lever located on the back side of the pedal body. To release the shoe a rider had to reach down and operate the lever, similar to the way a racing cyclist had to reach down and loosen the toestrap. The lever was placed on the outside edge of the pedal so that in the event of a fall the lever hitting the ground would release the foot. The pedal was designed for racing, in particular track racing, and because of the need to reach down to them to unclip, they have been referred to as \\"death cleats\\". In 1984, the French company Look applied downhill snow skiing binding or cleat technology to pedals, producing the first widely used clipless pedals. Initially used by triathletes in order to facilitate faster \\"transitions\\", Bernard Hinault's victory in Tour de France in 1985 then helped secure the acceptance of quick-release clipless pedal systems by cyclists. Those pedals, and compatible models by other manufacturers, remain in widespread use today. The cleat is engaged by simply pushing down and forward on the pedal, or, with some designs, by twisting the cleat in sideways. Then, instead of loosening a toestrap or pulling a lever, the cyclist releases a foot from the pedal by twisting the heel outward. SPD Dual Choice with shoe The next major development in clipless pedals was Shimano's SPD (Shimano Pedaling Dynamics) pedal system. Whereas Look cleats are large and protrude from the sole of the shoe, SPD cleats are small and could be fitted in a recess in the sole, making it possible to walk (although comfort will vary, as the soles of different cycling shoes vary in their rigidity, depending on design). Cycling shoes have rigid soles to maximize power transfer and efficiency. They may be specific to road or mountain biking, or usable for both. Shoes designed for mountain biking typically have recessed cleats that do not protrude beyond the sole of the shoe, and have treads for walking on trails, as walking or carrying the bike is often required. Road cycling shoes are typically lighter than their mountain bike counterparts, and feature a protruding cleat and less weatherproofing. The protruding cleat makes these shoes impractical for walking, as doing so can damage the cleat. Mountain bike cleats can generally be mounted without difficulty to road shoes although sometimes an adapter is required. Such attachment is not usually possible for road pedals, as the cleats are normally too large to be mounted on mountain shoes. The smaller mountain bike cleats are attached to the sole of the shoe by two bolts; larger road-specific cleats are attached by three. Various manufacturers have produced their own designs of clipless pedal systems over the years. Xpedo M-FORCE 4 TI pedals with six-degree float Platform adapters are designed to temporarily convert clipless pedals into more traditional platform pedals which have a larger and flatter area for the foot to rest on. Clipless pedals can have advantages over flat ones,\\"The advantages of clipless cycling pedals\\", Livestrong. Retrieved on August 17, 2013.\\"Why You Should Switch to Clipless Pedals\\", Gizmodo. Retrieved on August 17, 2013. especially in mountain biking and racing. They keep the foot from slipping in wet and muddy conditions and provide better transfer of power. Since the pedal platform adapters temporarily converts these into platform pedals, this allows riders to wear normal shoes without switching to another bike with a different pedal setup. They can be fastened by using bolts but as they are normally in temporary use, it is also common for them to be mounted using different snap- on techniques. Although it is possible to use clipless pedals with regular footwear, they will be much less comfortable than platform pedals, as the shoe sole is more likely to bend or slip. Float and tension Float is defined as the degree of movement offered by the cleat within the pedal before release begins. This can be highly important to prevent damage to knees, as most people's legs do not remain in a single plane as they pedal. Many standard road pedal systems offer cleats with a six-degree float. SPD-SL, Look Delta, Look K√©o, and Time cleats are also available in three-degree and zero- degree float. Road pedal systems commonly colour-code cleats by the amount of float offered. Some pedal systems have a fixed (non-adjustable) float, such as six degrees for Crankbrothers and 4.5 degrees for the K√©o Easy. Most cleats develop more float as they wear. =Magnet pedals= Davtus magnet pedal Magnetic pedals were introduced as early as 1897, and the Exus Mag Flux Road was available in 1996. Norbert Sadler and Wolfgang Duerr filed for a patent in 2005, and it has not been granted as of 2012. Established bicycle component manufacturer, Mavic, introduced a magnetic pedal and dedicated shoe for casual riding in 2009. Others have received mixed reviews. =Folding= To maximize compactness, folding bicycles often have pedals that fold as well. Brompton folding pedal.jpgFolding pedal on a Brompton bicycle Klapp-Pedal 04 (fcm).jpgFolding pedal on a standard bicycle, unfolded... Klapp-Pedal 05 (fcm).jpg...and folded Attachment The pedal spindle is threaded to match a threaded hole at the outboard end of the cranks. Multi-piece cranks have a hole with 20 TPI (a diameter/pitch combination fairly unique to this application). One-piece cranks use a by 20 TPI hole. French pedal spindles use M14 √ó 1.25 ( metric diameter with pitch) threads, and thread loosely into a 9/16 pedal hole. The threading size is often stamped into the crank, near the pedal hole. The right-side (usually the drive-side) pedal spindle is right- hand threaded, and the left-side (usually the non-drive-side) pedal spindle is left-hand (reverse) threaded to help prevent it from becoming loose by an effect called precession. Although the left pedal turns clockwise on its bearing relative to the crank (and so would seem to tighten a right-hand thread), the force from the rider's foot presses the spindle against the crank thread at a point which rolls around clockwise with respect to the crank, thus slowly pulling the outside of the pedal spindle anticlockwise (counterclockwise) because of friction, and thus would loosen a right-hand thread. For a short time in the early 1980s, Shimano made pedals and matching cranks that had a by 24 TPI interface. This was to allow a larger single bearing, as these pedals were designed to work with just one bearing on the crank side rather than the conventional design of one smaller bearing on each side.

It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Ostallg√§u, Weilheim- Schongau and Bad T√∂lz-Wolfratshausen, and by the Austrian state of Tyrol. History In medieval times the alpine lands were owned by the bishops of Freising and the abbots of Ettal Abbey. In 1803, when the clerical states of Germany were dissolved, the region was acquired by Bavaria. Geography The district is located in the Bavarian Alps and includes the highest mountain of Germany, the Zugspitze (2962 m). The highest peaks are grouped along the Austrian border, where the mountain ridges of the Wettersteingebirge and the Karwendelgebirge rise. Between them the Isar river runs northwards. North of these ridges there is a valley housing the tourist resort of Garmisch- Partenkirchen. The valley together with the surrounding mountains is called the Werdenfelser Land.

The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application, but it is generally 18. Minor may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority. For example, the drinking age in the United States is usually 21, and younger people are sometimes called minors in the context of alcohol law, even if they are at least 18. The term underage often refers to those under the age of majority, but it may also refer to persons under a certain age limit, such as the drinking age, smoking age, age of consent, marriageable age, driving age, voting age, etc. Such age limits are often different from the age of majority. The concept of minor is not sharply defined in most jurisdictions. The age of criminal responsibility and consent, the age at which school attendance is no longer compulsory, the age at which legally binding contracts can be entered into, and so on may be different from one another. In many countries, including Australia, India, Brazil, Croatia, and Colombia, a minor is defined as a person under the age of 18. In the United States, where the age of majority is set by the individual states, minor usually refers to someone under the age of 18 but can, in some states, be used in certain areas (such as casino gambling, handgun ownership and the consuming of alcohol) to define someone under the age of 21. In the criminal justice system in some places, \\"minor\\" is not entirely consistent, as a minor may be tried and punished for a crime either as a \\"juvenile\\" or, usually only for \\"extremely serious crimes\\" such as murder and/or theft, as an \\"adult\\". In Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, a minor is a person under 20 years of age. In New Zealand law, the age of majority is 20 years of age as well, but most of the rights of adulthood are assumed at lower ages: for example, entering contracts and having a will are allowed at 15,Richard Rudman. Zealand Employment Law Guide (2013 edition). Retrieved June 13, 2015. while the drinking and voting age are both at 18. International =Canada= For all provincial laws (such as alcohol and tobacco regulation), the provincial and territorial governments have the power to set the age of majority in their respective province or territory, and the age varies across Canada. Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Prince Edward Island have the age of majority set at 18, while in British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick the age of majority is 19. In Saskatchewan, the legal gambling age and the legal drinking age are both 19.\\"Drinking age will remain 19 in Saskatchewan\\". CBC News. (March 8, 2013). Retrieved June 13, 2015. =Italy= In Italy, law nr. 39 of March 8, 1975, states that a minor is a person under the age of 18. Citizens under the age of 18 may not vote (to vote for senators, 25), be elected, obtain a driving license for automobiles or issue or sign legal instruments. Crimes committed in Italy by minors are tried in a juvenile court. =Mexico= In all 31 states, a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18. Minors aged 16 or 17 who are charged with crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult. =India= In all 28 states and 8 union territories, a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18. In rare cases minors aged 16 or 17 who are charged with extremely heinous crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult. =Thailand= The Civil and Commercial Code of the Kingdom of Thailand does not define the term \\"minor\\"; however, sections 19 and 20 read as follows: * Section 19 ‚Äì A person, on completion of 20 years of age ceases to be a minor and become sui juris * Section 20 ‚Äì A minor becomes sui juris upon marriage, provided that the marriage is made in accordance with the provisions of Section 1448 Hence, a minor in Thailand refers to any person under the age of 20, unless they are married. A minor is restricted from doing juristic acts‚Äîfor example, sign contracts. When minors wish to do a juristic act, they have to obtain the consent from their legal representative, usually (but not always) the parents and otherwise the act is voidable. The exceptions are acts by which a minor merely acquires a right or is freed from a duty, acts that are strictly personal, and acts that are suitable to the person's condition in life and are required for their reasonable needs. A minor can make a will at the age of fifteen. =United Kingdom= In England and Wales and in Northern Ireland a minor is a person under the age of 18; in Scotland that age is 16. The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland is 10; and 12 in Scotland, formerly 8, which was the lowest age in Europe. In England and Wales, cases of minors breaking the law are often dealt with by the Youth Offending Team. If they are incarcerated, they are sent to a Young Offender Institution. Things that persons under 18 are prohibited from doing include sitting on a jury, voting, standing as a candidate, buying or renting films with an 18 certificate or R18 certificate or seeing them in a cinema, being depicted in pornographic materials, suing without a litigant friend, being civilly liable, accessing adoption records and purchasing alcohol, tobacco products, knives and fireworks. The rules on minimum age for sale of these products are frequently broken so in practice drinking and smoking takes place before the age of majority; however many UK shops are tightening restrictions on them by asking for identifying documentation from potentially underage customers. Driving certain large vehicles, acting as personal license holder for licensed premises, and adopting a child are only permitted after the age of 21. The minimum age to drive a HGV1 vehicle was reduced to 18. However, certain vehicles, e.g., steamrollers, require that someone be 21 years of age to obtain an operating license. =United States= In the United States as of 1995, minor is generally legally defined as a person under the age of 18. However, in the context of alcohol or gambling laws, people under the age of 21 may also sometimes be referred to as \\"minors\\". However, not all minors are considered \\"juveniles\\" in terms of criminal responsibility. As is frequently the case in the United States, the laws vary widely by state. Under this distinction, those considered juveniles are usually (but not always) tried in juvenile court, and they may be afforded other special protections. For example, in some states a parent or guardian must be present during police questioning, or their names may be kept confidential when they are accused of a crime. For many crimes (especially more violent crimes), the age at which a minor may be tried as an adult is variable below the age of 18 or (less often) below 16.Gaines, Larry K and Roger Leroy Miller. \\"Criminal Justice in Action\\" 4th ed., Thompson Wadsworth Publishing, 2007. Pg 495 For example, in Kentucky, the lowest age at which a juvenile may be tried as an adult, no matter how heinous the crime, is 14. The death penalty for those who have committed a crime while under the age of 18 was discontinued by the U.S. Supreme Court case Roper v. Simmons in 2005. The court's 5‚Äì4 decision was written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Stevens, Breyer, and Souter, and cited international law, child developmental science, and many other factors in reaching its conclusion. The twenty-sixth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1971, granted all citizens the right to vote in every state, in every election, from the age of 18. The U.S. Department of Defense took the position that they would not consider \\"enemy combatants\\" held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps minors unless they were less than sixteen years old. In any event, they only separated three of more than a dozen detainees under 16 from the adult prison population. Several dozen detainees between sixteen and eighteen were detained with the adult prison population. Now those under 18 are kept separate, in line with the age of majority and world expectations. Some states, including Florida, have passed laws that allow a person accused of an extremely heinous crime, such as murder, to be tried as an adult, regardless of age. These laws have been challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union. An estimated 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the United States. Emancipation of minors Emancipation of minors is a legal mechanism by which a minor is no longer under the control of their parents or guardians, and is given the legal rights associated with adults. Depending on country, emancipation may happen in different manners: through marriage, attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational degree or diploma, or participating in a form of military service. In the United States, all states have some form of emancipation of minors.

Victor's justice is a pejorative term referring to the unjust prosecution of the defeated party's acts in a conflict by the victorious party. Victor's justice generally involves excessive or unjustified punishment of defeated parties and light punishment or clemency for offenses committed by victors. Opponents argue that the difference in rules amounts to hypocrisy and revenge under the guise of retributive justice, leading to injustice, and targets of the label may consider it derogatory. The English term \\"Victors' justice\\" was first used by Richard Minear in his 1971 account of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and is typically (but not always) applied to the aftermath of warfare. It may be a loan translation of synonymous German Siegerjustiz, which is attested since at least the 1960s.https://www.dwds.de/r?q=Siegerjustiz;corpus=zeit;format=full;p=2;sort=date_desc;limit=50 The closely related term Vae victis behaviour is where a victor unilaterally changes the agreed treaties or their interpretations and is seen as a form of victor's justice.  History of the laws of war  Legal constraints on the conduct of war in Ancient Rome appear in Cicero: \\"As for war, humane laws touching it are drawn up in the fetial code of the Roman People.\\" Specifically, \\"no war is just, unless it is entered upon after an official demand for satisfaction has been submitted or warning has been given and a formal declaration made.\\"Cicero, On Duties Breaches of this duty by Roman citizens were adjudicated at trial. But to enemies of war, Roman law attributed neither duties nor rights; hence judgment ‚Äì and punishment ‚Äì of defeated foes was at Roman discretion. Still, the exercise of that discretion must serve justice, Cicero argued: \\"...when the victory is won, we should spare those who have not been blood-thirsty and barbarous in their warfare\\" (warmaking being excused only when \\"we may live in peace unharmed\\" in no other way). The Western tradition of thinking on just war continues into Christendom and then Modernity, and from the late 19th century becomes codified in international conventions, most notably those of Geneva and the Hague, then said to express laws of war.  Allegations  Waffen-SS lieutenant-colonel Otto Skorzeny's defence at the Dachau trials argued his alleged violations of the laws of war during the Battle of the Bulge were permitted by the military code of his opponent, the United States Army. Victor's justice is alleged to have occurred throughout history. A well-known ancient example is the Siege of Plataea in 429‚Äì427 BC, during the Peloponnesian War. The town of Plataea, a staunch ally of Athens, persistently stood a prolonged siege by the Spartans and their allies - finally surrendering to the Spartans, as all supplies they had were exhausted and no hope of help remained. They had trusted the Spartans to a fair trial, as the Spartans had promised to \\"judge them all fairly\\", and that \\"only the guilty should be punished\\" if they yielded. Yet, when the Plataean prisoners were brought before the judges, no trial was held and they could offer no real defense. The Spartans simply asked each of the prisoners if they had done the Spartans and allies any service in the war - to which the prisoners ultimately had to no choice but to answer \\"no\\". It was well-known to anybody involved that during the entire war the Plataeans had fought on the Athenian side, against the Spartans - that being the duly declared policy of their city state. Upon the Plataeans giving that negative answer, they were one by one put to death - over 200 of them. Thucydides clearly considered that this was an unfair judicial procedure. Documented allegations of Victor's justice became especially prevalent since the 19th century. James Madison Page, a veteran of the Union Army during the American Civil War, presented a stark and detailed example of victor's justice in his 1908 book The True Story of Andersonville Prison, subtitled \\"A Defense of Major Henry Wirz\\".Page, James Madison. The True Story of Andersonville Prison. Digital Scanning, Inc., Scituate, Mass., 1999. After describing his months as a prisoner of war of the Confederacy, Page recounts the imprisonment and trial of Major Henry Wirz, the only commandant of Camp Sumter prisoner of war camp near Andersonville, Georgia. The Confederacy held approximately 45,000 Union prisoners at Camp Sumter from February 1864 to April 1865, during which nearly 13,000 died due to the prison's horrific conditions. Wirz became known as \\"The Demon of Andersonville\\" in the victorious Union, and was one of only two Confederates convicted of war crimes for their actions during the American Civil War. Wirz was found guilty by a war crimes tribunal and publicly executed in Washington D.C. on 10 November 1865. Some have questioned the charges against Wirz, his personal responsibility for the conditions at Camp Sumter, and the fairness of his post-war trial. In 1980, historian Morgan D. Peoples referred to Wirz as a \\"scapegoat\\" and his conviction remains controversial.Morgan D. Peoples, \\"The Scapegoat of Andersonville‚Äô: Union Execution of Confederate Captain Henry Wirz\\", North Louisiana Historical Association Journal, Vol. 11, No. 4 (Fall 1980), pp. 3‚Äì18.Linda Wheeler. Wirz Took Controversial Fall for Andersonville Tragedy, The Washington Post, June 10, 2004. The war crimes trials following World War II were later observed featuring many of the phenomena and issues seen in Page's account of Wirz's trial, conviction, sentencing, and execution. The Nuremberg Criminal Court for war crimes (and subsidiary courts like the Dachau International Military Tribunal) prosecuted only Axis nationals or collaborators, and did not prosecute Allied war crimes. This led to the paradox that no one from the Soviet Union was charged although the USSR had participated in the Invasion of Poland on 17 September. So while German defendants were charged with waging war of aggression for Germany's attack on Poland, no one from the Soviet Union was charged even though the USSR had attacked Poland as well. Indeed, the Soviets even sat in judgment, as one of the four Allied judges was Soviet. Similarly, one of the indictments was \\"conspiracy to wage aggressive war\\", but the Soviets who conspired with the Nazis to wage aggressive war against Poland were not indicted. Additionally, it is usual that the armed forces of a civilized country\\"Judgement: The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\\" contained in the Avalon Project archive at Yale Law School. \\"but by 1939 these rules laid down in the [Hague] Convention [of 1907] were recognized by all civilized nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war...\\" will issue their forces with detailed guidance on what is and is not permitted under their military code. These are drafted to include any international treaty obligations and the customary laws of war. For example, at the trial of Otto Skorzeny, his defense was in part based on the Field Manual published by the War Department of the United States Army, on 1 October 1940, and the American Soldiers' Handbook.Trial of Otto Skorzeny and Others, General Military Government Court of the U.S. Zone of Germany, 18 August to 9 September 1947 If a member of the armed forces breaks their own military code, they can expect to face a court martial. When members of the Allied armed forces broke their military codes, they could be tried, as for example the Dachau massacre or the Biscari Massacre trials. The unconditional surrender of the Axis powers was unusual and led directly to the formation of the international tribunals. Usually international wars end conditionally and the treatment of suspected war criminals makes up part of the peace treaty. In most cases those who are not prisoners of war are tried under their own judicial system if they are suspected of committing war crimes - as happened at the end of WWII in Finland, where Allied Control Commission provided a list of occurrences of war crimes and crimes against peace and the investigation and judgment of these cases were left to Finnish courts according to Finnish law. However, an ex post facto law had to be instated for those cases, as the Finnish Criminal Act did not contain a concept of being responsible for politics resulting in a war. In restricting the international tribunal to trying suspected Axis war crimes, the Allies were acting within normal international law. The Reunification of Germany in October 1990 saw the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) to form the modern unified country of Germany. Reunification saw numerous East German officials charged with crimes by German courts that were direct continuations of West German courts, which some considered to be victor's justice. Many low-ranking members of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic were charged with crimes related to Republikflucht, with an estimated 300 to 400 deaths at the Berlin Wall and Inner German border. These border guards, known as Todessch√ºtzen (\\"death shooters\\"), were often convicted despite arguing they were following Schie√übefehl (\\"order to fire\\") from superiors which instructed guards to shoot escapees that ignored two warnings to stop. The German courts argued East German border laws were so fundamentally in conflict with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which East Germany had signed and ratified, that they were not law at all but formalized injustice, and thus the soldiers ought to have disobeyed their commanding officers.  Attempts to ensure the fairness of war crimes prosecutions  Since World War II, the accusation of victor's justice has arisen in every subsequent conflict where war crimes prosecutions have been made. Examples of include the Yugoslav wars, the Rwandan genocide, and the War in Afghanistan. The International Criminal Court (ICC) was set up in 2003 as a treaty arrangement between member states in an attempt to provide a neutral international court that avoids the accusation of \\"victor's justice\\", and that would prosecute all alleged war crimes, on either side of any conflict.  Current allegations  * The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), organized by the United Nations claims jurisdiction over all acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes within the territory of former Yugoslavia. However, so far the Tribunal has prosecuted only citizens from the Balkan states. Most defendants have been Serb politicians, soldiers and paramilitaries but Croats, Bosnians and ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas have also been tried. However, the Tribunal has declined to investigate allegations made by Western academics and Serb politicians, who accused NATO officials of war crimes during the 1999 bombing of Serbia (the Kosovo War), including the deliberate bombing of a Serb TV station killing journalists, and the lethal bombing (possibly reckless) of a railway bridge whilst a civilian train was passing over it.

Composed of plastic, aluminum, stainless steel, titanium or carbon fiber, it is attached to the main frame of a bicycle, the handlebars, behind the saddle, or, in uncommon cases, the fork. Most modern bicycles have threaded holes in the frame to hold the bottle cage, often called braze-ons even though they may be welded, glued, riveted, or moulded into the frame material. Clamps are necessary on bicycles not so equipped, such as older or less expensive models. Locations The most common location for a frame- mounted bottle cage is on the top side of the downtube. The most common location for a second frame-mounted bottle cage is on the front side of the seat tube. Small bikes and mountain bikes with rear suspension often do not have enough room for two bottle cages inside the main frame triangle. Some mountain bikes have highly sloped top tubes that limit the size of bottles mounted inside the triangle. Some touring bicycles have a third frame mounting location: under the downtube. Bottle cages may be mounted behind the seat with a bracket that attaches to the seatpost. Some uncommon forks include bottle cage mounts. Tandem bicycles may have as many as six bottle cages. Recumbent bicycles may have bottle cages mounted to the steering mechanism or behind the seat back. Styles The vast majority of bottle cages consist of a single hoop of metal tubing or rod bent to hold the bottle snugly and engage the top, or an indentation in the case of larger bottles, to prevent it from bouncing out. Varieties, often made out of plastic or carbon fiber, may completely encircle the bottle. Some manufacturers have released non-standard bottles and cages that only work with each other in order to offer specialized shapes (streamlined, for example) or restrict consumers to purchasing brand-specific items. Standards =Mounting= The standard bottle cage has two mounting holes, apart, to match the threaded holes in the frame, and through which small bolts pass. Some have a strap, adjustable for non standard bottles. The holes are usually sized and threaded to accept an M5 x 0.8 bolt, which means 5 mm in diameter and threads 0.8 mm apart (pitch). =Bottle= The standard size of bottle cage holds a bottle 2-7/8 inches (2.875\\") or 73 mm in diameter and five inches (5\\") or 127 mm tall, or with an indentation that far from the bottom for the tab on the cage to engage. Other uses Some examples of bicycle lighting take advantage of the bottle cage by using it to hold a bottle-shaped battery to power the lights. This sort of bicycle lighting has proved popular. Many small tire pumps come with a mounting bracket intended to be mounted alongside a bottle cage. The Trek Soho 3.0 comes with a stainless steel coffee mug designed to fit in the bottle cage mounted on the front side of the seat tube. In addition to the fairly standard cycling water bottle, cages have been produced to hold commercial 1 liter and 1.5 liter water bottles. History Until the 1960s, cyclists often carried a second bottle on the handlebars, held by a bottle cage fixed to the handlebars themselves and by a third point to the handlebar stem. Such bottle cages are familiar from pictures of the Tour de France. Riders had a cage there rather than have two on the frame, where the centre of gravity is lower, because at the time the Tour's rules insisted that riders carry a pump. The pump took up the length of one frame tube and made a second bottle cage on the frame impossible.

Mhlaba spent 25 years of his life in prison. Well known for being sentenced, along with Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu and others in the Rivonia Trial, he was an active member of the ANC and the South African Communist Party (SACP) all his adult life. His kindly manner brought him the nickname \\"Oom Ray\\".  Personal life  Mhlaba was born in Mazoka village in the Fort Beaufort district, Eastern Cape and was educated at Healdtown secondary school but had to drop out because of financial problems Mhlaba started working at a laundry in Port Elizabeth after leaving school in 1942. He met and married his first wife, Joyce Meke, who was also from the Fort Beaufort area in 1943. In their 17 years together, before her death in a car accident in 1960, they had three children Bukeka, Nomalungelo and Jongintshaba. In 1982, Mhlaba, who had been a political prisoner in Robben Island since 1964, was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison where he received special permission marry his common-law wife Dideka Heliso in 1986, with whom he had three children Mpilo, Nomawethu and Nikiwe. Early political career Mhlaba started working at a laundry in Port Elizabeth after leaving school in 1942. The horrendous conditions at the laundry converted him to a trade unionist and he became the leader of Non European Laundry Workers Union in 1943. In 1943, he joined the South African Communist Party, serving as the party's district secretary from 1946 until the party was banned in 1950. In 1944, he became a member of the African National Congress. From 1944 Mhlaba maintained dual membership of the ANC and the SACP. He rose through the ANC ranks becoming the chairman of the Port Elizabeth branch of the ANC from 1947 to 1953, and then elected to the Cape Executive committee. Mhlaba was the first to be arrested for disobeying apartheid laws during the nationwide Defiance Campaign of 1952 together with Govan Mbeki and Vuyisile Mini for three months in Rooi Hel ('Red Hell' or North End Prison, Port Elizabeth). The campaign was launched in Port Elizabeth when Mhlaba led a group of volunteers singing freedom songs through the \\"Whites Only\\" entrance of the New Brighton Railway Station. This action earned him the Xhosa nickname \\"Vulindlela\\" or \\"he who opens the way.\\" That same year, Mhlaba was charged under South Africa's Suppression of Communism Act. Although his political activities continued, he was barred from attending meetings or gatherings. After the ANC was banned on 8 April under the Unlawful Organisations Act, the party took up the armed struggle forming its military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mhlaba was one of its first recruits and was sent to China for military training. Before leaving he assisted Mandela in writing the Umkhonto constitution. In 1962, Mhlaba returned to South Africa, becoming a commander of the MK after Nelson Mandela's arrest. Rivonia Trial On 11 July 1963 the South African apartheid government raided the ANC's underground headquarters in Rivonia, north of Johannesburg. Mhlaba and 10 other ANC and SACP leaders including Ahmed Kathrada, Walter Sisulu and Govan Mbeki were arrested and Nelson Mandela was already in prison. They were charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government. On 9 October 1963, the world-famous Rivonia Trial with all the accused charged with high treason. On 12 June 1964, Mhlaba, Mandela and six other ANC leaders were sentenced to life imprisonment, and all were sent to Robben Island but the white Denis Goldberg was sent to Pretoria Central Prison instead of Robben Island. Struggle from prison During his time in Robben Island, Mhlaba and other ANC members founded the ANC High Command or High Organ with Mandela as its head. The committee educated and supported younger imprisoned members, formulated policies on day-to-day concerns, prisoners' complaints, and strikes, and enforced discipline within their isolation unit. Looking back at their time in Robben Island Mandela said of Mhlaba: ‚ÄúI got to know him as the peacemaker. He spent a lot of time urging fellow prisoners to forget their differences and unite so that conditions for prisoners could improve.\\" Release from prison After his release from prison on 15 October 1989, he was elected to the ANC national executive and the South African Communist Party central committee. He became national chairperson of the SACP in 1995. In January 1994 he was chosen as the ANC's nominee as Premier of the Eastern Cape, and in May 1994 he was elected to that post. He helped to establish the house of traditional leaders. He then became the High Commissioner to Uganda and Rwanda, until he retired in 2001. In April 2001 he released a book of his memoirs, narrated by him and researched and compiled by Thembeka Mafumadi. He was chairperson of a black economic empowerment consortium involved in the Coega port project, but suffered a stroke on 19 July 2003, recovering quickly. Death In 2004, Mhlaba was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer, and in December doctors discharged him from a private clinic saying there was nothing they could do for him. On 20 February 2005 he died in hospital. He was granted state funeral on 27 February 2005. Mhlaba is survived by his wife Dideka Heliso, three sons and five daughters. Legacy Mhlaba is seen as a stalwart member of both the ANC and the SACP. He was recognised with the Isitwalandwe Medal in 1992 for his role in the liberation struggle, and the Moses Kotane Award in 2002 for his contribution to the SACP. The Nkonkobe Local Municipality which includes Alice and Mhlaba's hometown Fort Beaufort was renamed the Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality and Andries Pretorius street, The R30 in Bloemfontein was renamed after Raymond Mhlaba to honour him. There's an ANC branch named after him in Mpumalanga, Nkangala region, sub-region Thembisile Hani ward 11 in Verena.

Life  William Colgate was born in Hollingbourne, Kent, England, on January 25, 1783. He was the son of Robert Colgate and his wife Sarah (n√©e Bowles). The family moved to a farm near Shoreham when William was six years old. Robert Colgate (1758‚Äì1826) was an 18th-century English farmer, politician and sympathiser with the American War of Independence and French Revolution, whose republican ideals impelled him to leave their farm in Shoreham, Kent in March 1798 and emigrate to Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States of America, after which the family settled on a farm in Harford County, Maryland. Colgate formed a partnership with Ralph Maher to manufacture soap and candles, and William helped the two men, but the partnership dissolved after two years. The family later settled in Delaware County, New York.Everts, W.W., William Colgate: The Christian Gentleman, Philadelphia. American Baptist Publication Society, 1881 William Colgate came to New York City in 1804. He there obtained employment as an apprentice to a soap-boiler. He closely watched the methods practiced by his employer, noting what seemed to him to be mismanagement, and learned useful lessons for his own guidance. At the close of his apprenticeship he was enabled, by correspondence with dealers in other cities, to establish himself in the business with some assurance of success. In 1806 William established a starch, soap and candle business in Manhattan, on Dutch Street. In 1820, he started a starch factory across the Hudson in Jersey City.\\"History\\", Colgate-Palmolive William followed his goal of prosperity through life, and became one of the most prosperous men in the city of New York. This circumstance, together with his great wisdom in counsel, and his readiness to aid in all useful and practicable enterprises, gave him a wide influence in the community, and especially in the denomination of which he was from early life an active and honored member. Religion For some time after coming to New York, Colgate attended worship with the congregation of the Rev. Dr. Mason, then one of the most eminent preachers of the Presbyterian Church. Writing to his father, an Arminian Baptist, of his purpose to make a public profession of his Christian faith in connection with the Presbyterian Church, he stated the chief points of his religious belief, quoting a \\"thus saith the Lord\\" for each. He received a kind reply cordially approving of that course, and asking for a \\"thus saith the Lord\\" in proof of sprinkling as Christian baptism, and of the baptism of infants as an ordinance of Christ. Happening to read the letter in an evening company of Christian friends, members of the church he attended, he remarked on leaving them that he must go home and answer his father's questions. \\"Poor young man,\\" exclaimed an intelligent Christian lady when he was gone, \\"he little knows what he is undertaking!\\" The Rev. William Parkinson, pastor of the First Baptist church in New York, baptized him in February, 1808. Colgate became a deacon. In 1811 he transferred his membership to the church in Oliver Street. In 1838 he became a member of the church worshipping in the Tabernacle, to the erection of which he had himself largely contributed. Colgate was a tither throughout his long and successful business career. He gave not merely one-tenth of the earnings of Colgate‚Äôs soap products; but he gave two-tenths, then three-tenths, and finally five-tenths of all his income to the work of God in the world. During the later days of his life he revealed the origin of his devotion to the idea of tithing. When he was sixteen years old he left home to find employment in New York City. He had previously worked in a soap manufacturing shop. When he told the captain of the canal boat upon which he was traveling that he planned to make soap in New York City the man gave him this advice: ‚ÄòSomeone will soon be the leading soap maker in New York. You can be that person. But you must never lose sight of the fact that the soap you make has been given to you by God. Honor Him by sharing what you earn. Begin by tithing all you receive.‚Äô William Colgate felt the urge to tithe because he recognized that God was the giver of all that he possessed, not only of opportunity, but even of the elements which were used in the manufacture of his products.Spiritual Life Through Tithing, G. Ernest Thomas (1955); Soap and Toothpaste: A Testimony About Giving Family Colgate married Mary Gilbert and had three sons, Robert, James and Samuel. His son Robert purchased Stonehurst at Riverdale-on- Hudson in The Bronx about 1859 shortly after it was built; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Philanthropy Colgate annually subscribed money to assist in defraying the expenses of Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution (later Madison University and Theological Seminary); and he was among the most strenuous opponents of their removal to the city of Rochester. His sons James and Samuel were both benefactors of Madison University and Theological Seminary. After seven decades of the Colgates' involvement, the school was renamed Colgate University in 1890.\\"Origins of Colgate University\\", Colgate University Colgate was a regular contributor to the funds of the Baptist Missionary Union, and took upon himself the entire support of a foreign missionary.

In the difficult economic climate of the 1920s the company found it hard to sell its 6/24 and 9/40 models. So the manufacturer decided to enter the small car market, and in 1927 signed a licensing agreement with the Austin Motor Company to build a variant of the Austin 7. A production level of 2000 cars a year was agreed upon, and Dixi paid Austin a royalty on each vehicle produced. The first 100 cars were supplied by Austin as kits, but by December 1927 the first of the official Dixi-manufactured vehicles, the DA-1 3/15PS were coming off the production line. The DA designation stood for Deutsche Ausf√ºhrung, meaning German Version; 3/15 indicated the taxation and actual horsepower ratings.

Red Clydeside is a significant part of the history of the labour movement in Britain as a whole, and Scotland in particular. Some newspapers of the time used the term \\"Red Clydeside\\" to refer, largely derisively, to the groundswell of popular and political radicalism that had erupted in Scotland. A confluence of charismatic individuals, organised movements and socio-political forces led to Red Clydeside, which had its roots in working class opposition to Britain's participation in World War I, although the area had a long history of political radicalism going back to the Society of the Friends of the People and the \\"Radical War\\" of 1820.William Kenefick, Red Scotland! The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872 to 1932 (Edinburgh University Press, 2007).Robert Keith Middlemas, The Clydesiders: A Left Wing Struggle for Parliamentary Power (Hutchinson & Co., 1965).  1911 strike at Singer  The 11,000 workers at the largest Singer sewing machines factory, in Clydebank, went on strike in March‚ÄìApril 1911, ceasing to work in solidarity with 12 female colleagues protesting against work process reorganisation. This reorganisation involved an increase in workload and a decrease in wages. Following the end of the strike, Singer fired 400 workers, including Jane Rae one of the women activists, and all strike leaders and purported members of the Industrial Workers of Great Britain, among them Arthur McManus, who later went on to become the first chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain between 1920 and 1922.The Singer strike 1911, Glasgow Digital Library Labour unrest, in particular by women and unskilled labour, greatly increased between 1910‚Äì1914 in Clydeside, with four times more days on strike than between 1900 and 1910. During these four years preceding World War I, membership of those affiliated to the Scottish Trades Union Congress rose from 129,000 in 1909 to 230,000 in 1914.  Anti-war activism  Willie Gallacher To mobilise the workers of Clydeside against the First World War, the Clyde Workers' Committee (CWC) was formed, with Willie Gallacher as its head and David Kirkwood its treasurer. The CWC led the campaign against the coalition governments of H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George and the Munitions of War Act 1915, which forbade engineers leaving the company they were employed in. The CWC met with government leaders, but no agreement could be reached and consequently both Gallacher and Kirkwood were arrested under the terms of the Defence of the Realm Act and jailed for their activities. Anti-war activity also took place outside the workplace and on the streets in general. The Marxist John Maclean and the Independent Labour Party (ILP) member James Maxton were both jailed for their anti-war propagandizing. Helen Crawford was opposed to conscription and, although there were anti-war and anti-conscription campaigns in organisations such as the WIL being organised and run by middle class women, few workingclass women were involved in Scotland. Frustration on her part on their lack of representation, Helen Crawfurd organised a grassroots meeting called 'The Great Womens Peace Conference' involving socialist-minded women in June 1916. From this meeting, and alongside her fellow Rent Striker Agnes Dollan, The Women's Peace Crusade (WPC) arose in November 1916 in Govan, Glasgow. As intended, the organisation initially attracted workingclass women in Govan to activism, and with open air meetings throughout Glasgow, Edinburgh and within Lowland Scotland they began to extend their reach. By 1917, street meetings were regularly being held all around the districts of Glasgow and beyond, including Partick, Maryhill, Bridgeton, Parkhead, Govan, Govanhill, Whiteinch, Shettleston, Springburn, Possilpark, Bellahouston, Rutherglen, Paisley, Overnewton Barrhead,, Cambuslang, Blantyre, Alloa, Cowdenbeath, Drongan, Drumpark, Douglas Water, Lanark, and as a further indicator of their success, a mass demonstration was organised by the WPC on Sunday, 8th July, 1917 where processions marched to the sound of music and the flying of banners from two sides of the city to the famous Glasgow Green in the centre of the city. As the two streams of Crusaders approached the green they merged into a huge colourful and noisy demonstration of around 14000 participants. By the time that the Peace Crusade disbanded it had become a UK-wide organisation.  Rent strikes  Mary Barbour At the turn of the twentieth century the Clydeside area in Glasgow experienced rapid industrial and population growth during which time Glasgow became Scotland‚Äôs largest city, Its population grew from almost 200,000 in 1851 to over 1,000,000 in 1921. Despite this exponential growth, housing remained a huge problem for its inhabitants as few houses were added to Glasgow's housing stock to accommodate the influx of immigrants from all over Scotland, other areas of Britain and Europe. Eleven percent of Glasgow's housing stock was vacant due to speculation and few new houses were built as landlords benefited from renting out overcrowded and increasingly dilapidated flats. As Highlanders and Irish migrants came to Glasgow, the city's population increased by 65,000 people between 1912 and 1915 while only 1,500 new housing units were built. Glaswegian activists had demanded legislation and the building of municipal housing as early as 1885, when the Royal Commission on Housing and the Working Class noted the housing crisis. The Scottish Housing Council organised in 1900 and under pressure from trade unions the Housing Letting and Rating Act 1911 was passed. The act introduced letting by month, previously workers with unstable jobs had been forced to put up a year's rent payment. But as landlords increased rents protests by tenants became more frequent. John Maclean of the British Socialist Party organised the Scottish Federation of Tenants' Associations in 1913 to fight against rent increases and championed public housing. In 1914 the Independent Labour Party Housing Committee and the Women's Labour League formed the Glasgow Women's Housing Association. Under the leadership of Mary Barbour, Mary Laird, Helen Crawfurd, Mary Jeff and Jessie Stephen the Glasgow Women's Housing Association became the driving force behind the rent strike that started in May 1915 in the industrialised area of Govan. Tenants refused to pay the latest increase in rents and staged mass demonstrations against evictions, resulting in violent confrontations. With the start of the First World War local young men left Glasgow to serve in the army overseas, and the first violent protest in the Govan district took place in April to resist the eviction of a soldier's family. As evictions were repeatedly attempted with support from the police, women attacked the factors and the sheriffs' men. In early summer 1915, the rent strikers were supported by mass demonstrations and by August, the rent strikers had found widespread support in Glasgow. Rent strikes spread from heavily industrialised areas of the city to artisanal areas and slum areas. Strikes ignited in Partick, Parkhead, Pollokshaws, Pollok, Cowcaddens, Kelvingrove, Ibrox, Govanhill, St Rollox, Townhead, Springburn, Maryhill, Fairfield, Blackfriars, and Woodside. In October 1915, 15,000 tenants were on rent strike and a demonstration led by women converged on St Enoch Square. By November, 20,000 tenants were on rent strike as violent resistance against evictions continued. Trade unions threatened factory strikes if evictions supported by the police continued and following demonstrations on 17 November, legal action against rent strikers was halted. State Secretary of Scotland McKinnon Wood asked the Cabinet to freeze all rents at pre-war levels and in December, the Rents and Mortgage Interest Restriction Act 1915 received royal assent.  The 40 Hour Strike  The left- wing activities continued after the end of the war. The campaign for a 40-hour week, with improved conditions for the workers, occupied the exertions of organised labour. On 31 January 1919, a massive rally, organised by the trade unions, took place on George Square in the city centre of Glasgow. It has been estimated that as many as 90,000 people were present, and the Red Flag was raised in the centre of the crowd. The gathering descended into what is generally considered to have been a police riot, with the Riot Act being read, and attacks made on the strike leaders as they exited the City Chambers. Medium Mark C tanks and soldiers deployed to the city (31 January 1919) The Coalition government panicked, fearing a possible threat to order or even a Bolshevik-style insurrection. It was only fourteen months since the Russian Revolution, and the German Revolution was still in progress in January 1919. Troops based in the city's Maryhill barracks were locked inside their post, with troops and tanks from elsewhere being sent into the city to control unrest and extinguish any revolution that should break out. No Glaswegian troops were deployed, and few veterans, with the government fearing that fellow Glaswegians might sympathise with the strikers if a revolutionary situation developed in Glasgow. Young, mostly untried, troops were transported from camps and barracks around the country and stationed on the streets of Glasgow, specifically to combat this possibility.  A revolutionary moment?  Manny Shinwell There remains a debate on the left, over whether the Red Clydeside movement constituted a revolutionary opportunity for the working- class, though on the face of it, it would appear that the revolutionary potential of the Clydeside working-class has been exaggerated. Firstly, except Maclean, none of the labour leaders developed a class analysis of the war, nor did they seriously consider threatening the power and authority of the state. Furthermore, it was the behaviour of those conducting the war, not the war itself that provoked opposition within the labour movement. The Independent Labour Party's May Day Manifesto of 1918 makes this very clear in calling for A Living Wage for all and Justice for our Soldiers and their Dependants. Moreover, the massive demand for men to fight in the war meant that few Glaswegian families escaped personal loss of some kind. To undermine the war effort was to risk alienating the working-class, which many labour leaders were unwilling to do-‚Äìapart from Maxton, Gallacher and Maclean. William Gallacher, who would later become a Communist MP claimed that, whilst the leaders of the rally were not seeking revolution, in hindsight they should have been. He claimed that they should have marched to the Maryhill Barracks and tried to persuade the troops stationed there to come out on the protesters' side. The trade union leaders, who had organised the meeting, were arrested. Most were acquitted, although both Gallacher and Manny Shinwell were put in jail for their activities that day, Shinwell also being charged with an inflammatory speech the week before in James Watt Street in the city's docks, in an episode that later erupted into a race riot.  \\"Reds\\" in Parliament  The ensuing 1922 general election saw the rise of Labour in the Clyde valley. The aura of Red Clydeside grew as delegations of organised labour replaced the Liberal Party as the political formation most popular among the working class. This manifested itself at the 1922 general election, when several of the Red Clydesiders were elected to serve in the House of Commons (most of them Independent Labour Party members). They included Maxton, Wheatley, Shinwell, Kirkwood, Neil Maclean and George Buchanan. According to the Labour Party, the Red Clydesiders were viewed as having a dissident left-wing character. Many of them, most notably Maxton and Wheatley, were great critics of the first and second Labour governments, elected in 1924 and 1929 respectively. The Red Clydeside era still impacts upon the politics of the area today. Ever since, Glasgow has been known for political and industrial militancy. The Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Work In of 1971 offers a pertinent example. Until 2015, the Labour Party held the most influence as the dominant political force in the area. This period in Glasgow‚Äôs colourful past remains a significant landmark for those on the political left in Scotland. The story of the Red Clydesiders can still be politically motivating. At the 1989 Glasgow Central by-election, the Scottish National Party candidate Alex Neil called himself and the SNP member of Parliament for Govan at the time, Jim Sillars; the \\"new Clydesiders\\". Labour ceased to be the dominant political entity in Glasgow, and indeed in the rest of Scotland, in 2015. In the general election of that year they lost all their seats in Glasgow to the SNP. In the election of 2017, Labour regained Glasgow North East, but the other six Glasgow constituencies were again won by the SNP, who regained Glasgow North East in the election of 2019.  Popular culture  The album Red Clydeside by Alistair Hulett & Dave Swarbrick contains nine songs about the movement, particularly the anti-war protests and the rent strike. The Red Clydeside movement was also featured in John McGrath's play Little Red Hen, performed by 7:84.

The station, WDAA, was born when Doctor C. E. Crosland, Associate President, realized the potential advertising value to the college of a radio station. The WDAA program on April 18, 1922, marked the first time a music program was broadcast in Nashville. The broadcast could be heard 150 to from the school. DeWitt later became WSM (AM) radio station's chief engineer, 1932‚Äì1942, and president, 1947‚Äì1968. =Ties to the Tennessee Baptist Convention= In 1951, Ward-Belmont College, the finishing school operated in Nashville by Ward- Belmont, Inc., was facing severe financial difficulties. To relieve those problems, the school entered into a relationship with the Tennessee Baptist Convention (TBC). Under the terms of that relationship, the TBC provided the school with financial support and in exchange was granted certain management rights related to the school. In particular, all of the members of the school's Board of Trustees were required to hold membership in a Baptist church. The TBC made Ward-Belmont coeducational in spring 1951, and shortened the school's name to simply Belmont College. Under Herbert Gabhart, who served as president from 1959 to 1982, Belmont's enrollment leaped from 365 students to 2,000, and it launched a music business program. Gabhart was succeeded by Bill Troutt, who at 32 was the youngest college president in the nation. The school's growth continued, and in 1991 it became a university. In 2005 Belmont's Board of Trustees sought to remove Belmont University from the control of the Tennessee Baptist Convention while remaining in a \\"fraternal relationship\\" with it. Advocates of this plan presented a blueprint for change in which all board members would be Christians but only 60 percent would be Baptists in order to affirm a Christian affinity while acknowledging the diversity of both the faculty and the student body. The head of the TBC would continue to be an ex officio board member. The TBC rejected this plan. In November 2005 The Tennessean reported that the TBC would increase its funding of two other institutions, Union University and Carson-Newman College by the amount previously given to Belmont and Belmont would replace the three percent of its budget that was funded by the TBC; this announcement seemed to mark the end of the matter. However, on April 7, 2006 The Tennessean reported that the TBC would seek to oust the existing board and replace it with one consisting entirely of Southern Baptists and amenable to ongoing TBC control. After settlement talks failed, the Tennessee Baptist Convention Executive Board filed a lawsuit on September 29, 2006 against Belmont seeking the return of approximately $58 million. Belmont severed its ties from the Tennessee Baptist Convention in 2007, when the university announced it would be a Christian university without any denominational affiliations. On November 14, 2007, Nashville media reported that a settlement of this suit had been reached before trial. Under its terms, the TBC and Belmont would disaffiliate amicably, with Belmont agreeing to pay one million dollars to the convention immediately, and $250,000 annually for the next forty years, for a total cost of $11 million. The university has stated its intent to maintain a Christian identity, but no longer a specifically Baptist one.Belmont, Tennessee Baptists, Settle Lawsuit, End Relationship. Ethicsdaily.com.

The relationship between CoreCivic and the University extends to the early 1980's. In 1983, notable Tennessee businessman Jack C. Massey, provided a portion of the initial funding to begin Corrections Corporation of America, along with Thomas Beasley. Discussed as early as 1966, Belmont's Massey Graduate School of Business was founded shortly after in 1986.

He has since mediated a few national political disputes and operates a clinic in Somgand√©. Ou√©draogo received his early education in Upper Volta before joining the Upper Voltan Army and studying medicine abroad. After working in healthcare he was appointed chief medical officer of the Ouagadougou military camp. He participated in the November 1982 coup d'√©tat in Upper Volta and shortly thereafter assumed the presidency. More ideologically moderate than most of his comrades, Ou√©draogo did not command much popular support and governed the country amid an unstable political climate. A protracted dispute with Prime Minister Thomas Sankara resulted in his removal from power in a coup in August 1983 and imprisonment. He was released in 1985 and resumed medical work. He opened a clinic in Somgand√© in 1992, which he still operates. In the 2010s he acted as a mediator between opposing political factions.  Early life and education  Jean-Baptiste Ou√©draogo was born on 30 June 1942 in Kaya, French West Africa, to a Mossi family. He started his education at the √âcole Primaire Catholique de Bam, later attending the minor seminary of Pabr√© before completing his secondary education at the Lyc√©e de Philippe-Zinda-Kabor√© de Ouagadougou. He studied medicine at the University of Abidjan and the School of Naval Medicine in Bordeaux, graduating from the latter in 1974. He then took courses at the University of Strasbourg, with a focus in paediatrics. Ou√©draogo finished his studies with a doctor of medicine, and degrees in sports medicine and in paediatrics and child welfare. Ou√©draogo became the first head of the paediatrics department at the Centre hospitalier universitaire Yalgado-Ou√©draogo in Ouagadougou, serving there from 1976 until 1977. Afterwards he interned at a hospital in Mulhouse until 1981. He married a school teacher, Bernadette, and had three children with her, all of whom became physicians.  Military career and presidency  = Early military career = Ou√©draogo was commissioned as a second lieutenant and medic into the Upper Voltan Army in October 1972. In October 1979 he was promoted to m√©dicin-commandant (equivalent to major). Three years later he was appointed chief medical officer of the new Ouagadougou military base, Camp Militaire de Gounghin. = 1982 coup and assumption of presidency = On 7 November 1982 Ou√©draogo participated in a military coup which ousted President of Upper Volta Saye Zerbo. He and his fellow military officers then formed the Conseil de Salut du Peuple (CSP). Two days later the council elected him President as a compromise choice between the leftist radicals and conservatives. He was the first Mossi head of state since Maurice Yam√©ogo. According to Ou√©draogo, Captain Thomas Sankara was supposed to take power but withdrew at the last minute, leading other officers to choose him to assume the presidency due to his senior rank though, in his words, \\"against my will\\". Unlike Sankara, he lacked political experience and popular support, and was quickly regarded by the leftist members of the CSP as conservative and sympathetic to policies of France. Ou√©draogo thought of his opponents as \\"hard-core Marxists\\" and maintained that he was a \\"liberal and sincere democrat\\". Nevertheless, the media viewed Ou√©draogo and Sankara as united in goals and dubbed them \\"Siamese twins\\". Shortly after taking power, Ou√©draogo told the foreign diplomatic corps in Upper Volta that the new government would uphold a non-aligned foreign policy, respect its international agreements, and defend its territory with \\"intransigence\\". On 21 November Ou√©draogo declared that the CSP would restore a constitutional, civilian regime in two years time. Five days later the CSP installed a formal government. Ou√©draogo was the only soldier in the cabinet and, in addition to his role as President, was made Minister of National Defence and Veterans Affairs. On the whole the CSP exercised true control of the government while Ou√©draogo served as little more than a figurehead. The freedoms of labour unions and the press, having been restricted under Zerbo's reign, were restored by the new administration. Ou√©draogo attended Mogho Naba Kougri's funeral in December and placed a wreath at the Mossi leader's coffin. The CSP elected Sankara as Prime Minister in January 1983, in effect instituting a power counterbalance to Ou√©draogo. On 28 February a plot by several army officers to massacre the CSP in assembly and restore Zerbo's regime was foiled when they delayed and were arrested by other officials. One of the leading putschists was a commandant who had been considered for the presidency following the 1982 coup. When questioned about the incident, Ou√©draogo told the press, \\"Since our regime makes many people uneasy, it is quite normal that people should plan this sort of reaction.\\" He publicly declared his determination to \\"guarantee order and security\\" and asserted that \\"the army will not allow itself to be dissuaded by tribal fights and ideologies\\". He also stated that corruption and fraud in the business community had, in part, facilitated the state of \\"total anarchy\\" over which the government presided, and announced that the national administration would be restructured to mitigate the disorder. Meanwhile, as Sankara toured various communist and socialist countries, rumors circulated among the Voltaic population that the CSP would assume a radical leftist approach to governing and expropriate small businesses. In an attempt to alleviate concerns, Ou√©draogo told members of the National Council of Voltaic Employers that \\"private initiative will be maintained...you are the primary motor of the country's economic activity\\". Sankara concluded his tour with a visit to Libya. A Libyan transport aircraft landed at Ouagadougou Airport shortly after his return, generating rumours of a plot to install a pro-Libya regime in Upper Volta. Ou√©draogo assured the populace that it was \\"a routine visit, a kind of courtesy call and I think that we must not try to see anything beyond that,\\" and stated that \\"there should be no talk of setting up a Voltaic Jamahiriya\\". On 26 March Ou√©draogo and Sankara held a meeting in the capital, where differences in their beliefs began to emerge. That day the CSP organised a large rally in the city where a moderate speech by Ou√©draogo was much less enthusiastically received than Sankara's radical remarks. From 20 to 26 April Ou√©draogo and several of his ministers visited Lom√©, Togo; Accra, Ghana; and Niamey, Niger. = Dispute with Sankara and overthrow = Ou√©draogo's rehabilitation of former Upper Voltan President Maurice Yam√©ogo (pictured) generated backlash from some politicians. As his tenure progressed, Ou√©draogo found himself unable to reconcile the conservative and radical factions of the CSP, whose disagreements were leading to a political stalemate. On 14 May 1983 the CSP convened in the town of Bobo-Dioulasso. A crowd gathered to hear a message from the council. Sankara spoke until dusk, and the crowd mostly dispersed, its members eager to break their Ramadan fasts. Ou√©draogo was in turn left without an audience for his speech, as Sankara seemingly intended in an effort to humiliate him. The following day he met with Guy Penne, a top African affairs adviser of President of France Fran√ßois Mitterrand. On 16 May he purged his government of pro-Libyan and anti-French elements, disbanded the CSP, and had Sankara and several other important officials arrested. Explaining the reasons for the radicals' removal, he said, \\"It is a problem of ideology...We were following step by step the program of the [Ligue patriotique pour le d√©veloppement], and that program was to lead us to a communist society.\\" He met again with Penne, who promised his government significant financial aid from France. One officer, Blaise Compaor√©, evaded capture and escaped to Sankara's former garrison at P√¥ where he began to organise resistance. In the following days large demonstrations occurred in Ouagadougou in support of Sankara. Ou√©draogo's political position was weak; his left-wing opponents were well organised while he did not have reliable connections with the conservative factions he supposedly represented and could only really count on the support of a handful of his former classmates from the Pabr√© minor seminary. Realising that the use of force was of little recourse, he sought to resolve the situation by appeasing his adversaries. On 27 May Ou√©draogo delivered a speech, promising a quick return to civilian rule and the liberation of political prisoners. He also announced the drafting of a new constitution within six months, to be followed by an election in which he would not participate. He also felt that the increased politicisation of the army was dangerous and compounded the threat of a civil war, so he warned that any soldiers found to be involving themselves in politics would be reprimanded. Stating that the older generation of politicians had been discredited and should retire, he announced that \\"patriots\\" and \\"new men with a sense of responsibility and national realities\\" should assume leadership of the country. Ou√©draogo finished by expressing his hope that the Upper Voltan youth could avoid the trappings of partisan politics. Several days later he released Sankara, who was confined under guard to house arrest. While the situation deteriorated, Ou√©draogo accelerated the execution of his goals, liberating many political prisoners held under Zerbo's regime. However, his extension of political rehabilitation to Yam√©ogo antagonised many politicians whom Yam√©ogo had repressed. Sankara was soon rearrested but then released following mounting pressure from Compaor√©'s troops. On 4 June Ou√©draogo removed a number of pro-Sankara ministers from his government. Tensions continued to increase until 4 August when Compaor√© launched a coup. Paratroopers mobilised in P√¥ to march on Ouagadougou. Meanwhile, Ou√©draogo consulted his chief of staff, who advised him to negotiate an end to his political conflict with Sankara. Ou√©draogo received Sankara at 19:00 at his residence and offered to resign \\"to facilitate the establishment of a transitional government that would be unanimous\\". Sankara agreed to the proposal but asked for a few hours' delay so he could discuss it with Compaor√©. He departed at 20:30 but was unable to inform Compaor√© or the other putschists of the truce. At around the same time the paratroopers infiltrated the capital and began to seize strategic locations throughout. At Ou√©draogo's residence, men of the Presidential Guard exchanged heavy fire with the putschists before surrendering. Compaor√© arrived on the scene at around 22:00, followed by Sankara an hour later. The latter informed Ou√©draogo of the \\"revolution\\" and offered to exile him and his family. Ou√©draogo replied that he would rather remain in the country under the new regime. He was then taken to the Presidential Palace to spend the night. The following evening he was imprisoned at the military camp in P√¥. Sankara became the new President of Upper Volta. Ou√©draogo was officially removed from his post as Minister of National Defence on 23 August and succeeded by Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani. He was discharged from the army two days later. Sankara changed the name of Upper Volta to Burkina Faso in 1984, and three years later he was killed in a coup and replaced by Compaor√©.  Later life  Ou√©draogo was granted clemency on 4 August 1985 and returned to medical work, taking a job at the H√¥pital Yalgado-Ou√©draogo. Nevertheless, the Sankara regime monitored his activities and restricted him from reentry into the army. In 1992 he successfully secured a loan of 250 million West African CFA francs from a French bank and founded a clinic, the Notre-Dame de la Paix, in the Somgand√© district, south of Ouagadougou. In 2007 he served between 400 and 500 patients a month. In 2005 Ou√©draogo was awarded a gold medal by the Geneva-based Foundation for Excellence in Business Practice. He also won the first prize in the Ministry of the Environment's competition for the best living environment health facilities in the Centre Region. That December a street in the Nongr-Massom district of Ouagadougou was named after him. In 2016 he was the president of the F√©d√©ration des Associations Professionnelles de la Sant√© Priv√©e. As of 2019 Ou√©draogo still worked at his medical clinic. = Involvement in politics = Upon his return to medical work in 1985 Ou√©draogo declared that he would not take an active role in politics and from then on he generally showed little interest in involving himself in public affairs. In 1999 he was made a member of the Conseil du Sages, though by 2014 he had left the consultative body. In November 2012 he delivered a speech on behalf of himself and Saye Zerbo, expressing concern about how corrupt Burkina Faso's administration had become over the preceding years and accusing the country's leaders of inaction on the matter. In early 2014 Ou√©draogo acted as a mediator between President Compaor√© and opposition groups as tensions between the two dramatically rose. However, the arbitration failed in April, and Compaor√© later resigned and fled the country. In September 2015 members of the military launched a coup. Ou√©draogo was asked to mediate, and he attempted to delay the putschists and secure the release of hostages. As the army turned against the coup he made multiple appeals to the plot's leader, Gilbert Diend√©r√©, to surrender. After seeking refuge in the Vatican embassy, Diend√©r√© was handed over to Burkinab√© transitional government authorities and Ou√©draogo escorted him into custody at the gendarmerie base in the capital. In April 2017 Ou√©draogo and several other national figures met with leaders of the Coalition for Democracy and National Reconciliation, an opposition coalition formed out of Compaor√©'s supporters, to discuss political reconciliation. In 2020 he released a memoir entitled Ma part de v√©rit√©.

During this time Shorter \\"established himself as one of the most gifted of the young saxophonists\\" and received international acknowledgment. =With Miles Davis (1964‚Äì70)= Herbie Hancock said of Shorter's tenure in Davis's Second Great Quintet: \\"The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He still is a master. Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed.\\" Davis said, \\"Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, writes the parts for everybody just as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste.\\" Ian Carr, musician and Rough Guide author, states that with Davis, Shorter found his own voice as a player and composer. \\"Blakey's hard-driving, straight-ahead rhythms had brought out the muscularity in Shorter's tenor playing, but the greater freedom of the Davis rhythm-section allowed him to explore new emotional and technical dimensions.\\" Shorter remained in Davis's band after the breakup of the quintet in 1968, playing on early jazz fusion recordings including In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew (both 1969). His last live dates and studio recordings with Davis were in 1970. Until 1968, he played tenor saxophone exclusively. The final album on which he played tenor in the regular sequence of Davis albums was Filles de Kilimanjaro. In 1969, he played the soprano saxophone on the Davis album In a Silent Way and on his own Super Nova (recorded with then-current Davis sidemen Chick Corea and John McLaughlin). When performing live with Davis, and on recordings from summer 1969 to early spring 1970, he played both soprano and tenor saxophones; by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano. Solo Blue Note recordings Simultaneous with his time in the Davis quintet, Shorter recorded several albums for Blue Note Records, featuring almost exclusively his own compositions, with a variety of line-ups, quartets and larger groups, including Blue Note favourites such as trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. His first Blue Note album (of 11 in total recorded from 1964 to 1970) was Night Dreamer, recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in 1964 with Lee Morgan (trumpet), McCoy Tyner (piano), Reggie Workman (bass) and Elvin Jones (drums). The later album The All Seeing Eye (rec. 1965, rel. 1966) was a workout with a larger group, while Adam's Apple(rec. 1966, rel. 1967) was back to carefully constructed melodies by Shorter leading a quartet. Then a sextet again in the following year for Schizophrenia (rec. 1967, rel. 1969) with Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, trombonist Curtis Fuller, alto saxophonist/flautist James Spaulding and strong rhythms by drummer Joe Chambers. Shorter also recorded occasionally as a sideman (again, mainly for Blue Note) with trumpeter Donald Byrd, McCoy Tyner, trombonist Grachan Moncur III, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, and bandmates Herbie Hancock and drummer Tony Williams. =Weather Report (1971‚Äì1986)= Shorter with Weather Report in Amsterdam, in 1980 Following the release of Odyssey of Iska in 1970, Shorter formed the fusion group Weather Report with Davis veteran keyboardist Joe Zawinul and bassist Miroslav Vitous. The other original members were percussionist Airto Moreira, and drummer Alphonse Mouzon. After Vitous' departure in 1973, Shorter and Zawinul co-led the group until the band's break-up in late 1985. A variety of musicians would make up Weather Report over the years (most notably the revolutionary bassist Jaco Pastorius) helping the band produce many high quality recordings in diverse styles, with funk, bebop, Latin jazz, ethnic music, and futurism being the most prevalent denominators. Solo and side projects Shorter also recorded critically acclaimed albums as a bandleader, notably 1974's Native Dancer, which featured Hancock and Brazilian composer and vocalist Milton Nascimento. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, he toured in the V.S.O.P. quintet. This group was a revival of the 1960s Davis quintet, except that Freddie Hubbard filled the trumpet chair. Shorter appeared with the same former Davis bandmates on the Carlos Santana double LP The Swing of Delight (1980), for which he also composed a number of pieces. From 1977 through 2002, he appeared on 10 Joni Mitchell studio albums, gaining him a wider audience. He played an extended solo on the title track of Steely Dan's 1977 album Aja. Shorter performing in 2006 =Later career= After leaving Weather Report in 1986, Shorter continued to record and lead groups in jazz fusion styles, including touring in 1988 with guitarist Carlos Santana, who appeared on This is This! (1986), the last Weather Report disc. There is a concert video recorded at the Lugano Jazz Festival in 1987, with Jim Beard (keyboards), Carl James (bass), Terri Lyne Carrington (drums), and Marilyn Mazur (percussion). In 1989, he contributed to a hit on the rock charts, playing the sax solo on Don Henley's song \\"The End of the Innocence\\" and also produced the album Pilar by the Portuguese singer-songwriter Pilar Homem de Melo. He has also maintained an occasional working relationship with Herbie Hancock, including a tribute album recorded shortly after Miles Davis's death with Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams and Wallace Roney. He continued to appear on Mitchell's records in the 1990s and can be heard on the soundtrack of the Harrison Ford film The Fugitive (1993). In 1995, Shorter released the album High Life, his first solo recording for seven years. It was also his debut as a leader for Verve Records. Shorter composed all the compositions on the album and co-produced it with the bassist Marcus Miller. High Life received the Grammy Award for best Contemporary Jazz Album in 1997. Shorter worked with Herbie Hancock once again in 1997, on the much acclaimed and heralded album 1+1. The song \\"Aung San Suu Kyi\\" (named for the Burmese pro-democracy activist) won both Hancock and Shorter a Grammy Award. In 2009, he was announced as one of the headline acts at the Gnaoua World Music Festival in Essaouira, Morocco. His 2013 live album Without a Net (rec. 2010) is his first with Blue Note Records since Odyssey of Iska (rec. 1970, rel. 1971). Quartet The Wayne Shorter Quartet at the Teatro degli Arcimboldi, Milan, 2010 In 2000, Shorter formed the first permanent acoustic group under his name, a quartet with pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade, playing his own compositions, many of them reworkings of tunes going back to the 1960s. Four albums of live recordings have been released: Footprints Live! (rec. live 2001, rel. 2002); Beyond the Sound Barrier (rec. live 2002‚Äì2004, rel. 2005); Without a Net (rec. live 2010, rel. 2013); and Emanon (2018), with the latter, in addition to live material, including Shorter‚Äôs quartet in a studio session with the 34-piece Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. The quartet has received great acclaim from fans and critics, especially for the strength of Shorter's tenor saxophone playing. The biography Footprints: The Life and Work of Wayne Shorter by journalist Michelle Mercer examines the working life of the musicians as well as Shorter's thoughts and Buddhist beliefs. Beyond the Sound Barrier received the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album. Shorter's 2003 album Alegr√≠a (his first studio album for 10 years, since High Life) received the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album; it features the quartet with a host of other musicians, including pianist Brad Mehldau, drummer Carrington and former Weather Report percussionist Alex Acu√±a. Shorter's compositions, some new, some reworked from his Miles Davis period, feature the complex Latin rhythms that he specialised in during his Weather Report days. =Lifetime achievement recognition= On September 17, 2013, Shorter received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. On December 18, 2014, the Recording Academy announced that Shorter was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in honor of his \\"prolific contributions to our culture and history\\". In 2016, Shorter was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the field of music composition, the only jazz artist to receive the honor that year.Wayne Shorter awarded Guggenheim Fellowship. Jazz Times. April 8, 2016. In 2017, Shorter was announced as the joint winner of the Polar Music Prize. The award committee stated: \\"Without the musical explorations of Wayne Shorter, modern music would not have drilled so deep.\\" In 2018, Shorter was a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor Award. =Wayne Shorter: Zero Gravity= In 2015, producer/director Dorsay Alavi began filming a documentary about the life of Wayne Shorter called Wayne Shorter: Zero Gravity.\\"Wayne Shorter: Zero Gravity Documentary\\", Pledgemusic. The film is set to be released in 2020. = Mega Nova = In 2016, it was announced that Shorter, Carlos Santana, and Herbie Hancock would begin touring under the name Mega Nova. Also included within the supergroup was bassist Marcus Miller and drummer Cindy Blackman Santana. Their first show together was on August 24, 2016 at the Hollywood Bowl. =Health= Shorter‚Äôs health over the past few years has finally forced him to retire from his near 70-year performing career. As his health permits, he continues to compose with a particular focus on completing a new operatic work. =Personal life= Shorter met Teruko (Irene) Nakagami in 1961. They were later married and had a daughter, Miyako. Some of his compositions are copyrighted as \\"Miyako Music\\" and Shorter dedicated the pieces \\"Miyako\\" and \\"Infant Eyes\\" to his daughter. The couple separated in 1964. Shorter met Ana Maria Patricio in 1966 and they were married in 1970. In 1985, their daughter Iska died of a grand mal seizure at age 14. Ana Maria and the couple's niece, Dalila, were both killed on July 17, 1996, on TWA Flight 800, while travelling to visit him in Italy.\\"Times Topics\\". The New York Times. Retrieved June 4, 2013. Dalila was the daughter of Ana Maria Shorter's sister and her husband, jazz vocalist Jon Lucien. In 1999, Shorter married Carolina Dos Santos, a close friend of Ana Maria. She practices Nichiren Buddhism and is a longtime member of the Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International. Composer and producer Rick Shorter was Shorter's cousin.Old Times, Winter / Spring 2012 - p. 12, UCC principal's son makes beautiful music, Nick Krewen Discography *Introducing Wayne Shorter (aka Blues a la Carte, Vee-Jay, 1959) *Second Genesis (Vee-Jay, rec. 1960, rel. 1974) *Wayning Moments (Vee-Jay, 1962) *Night Dreamer (Blue Note, 1964) *JuJu (Blue Note, 1964) *Speak No Evil (Blue Note, rec. 1964, rel. 1966) *The Soothsayer (Blue Note, rec. 1965, rel. 1979) *Et Cetera (Blue Note, rec. 1965, rel. 1980) *The All Seeing Eye (Blue Note, rec. 1965, rel. 1966) *Adam's Apple (Blue Note, rec. 1966, rel. 1967) *Schizophrenia (Blue Note, rec. 1967, rel. 1969) *Super Nova (Blue Note, 1969) *Moto Grosso Feio (Blue Note, rec. 1970, rel. 1974) *Odyssey of Iska (Blue Note, rec. 1970, rel. 1971) *Native Dancer (Columbia, rec. 1974, rel. 1975) with Milton Nascimento *Atlantis (Columbia, 1985) * Phantom Navigator (Columbia, rec. 1986, rel. 1987) *Joy Ryder (Columbia, 1988) *High Life (Verve, 1995) *1+1 (Verve, 1997) with Herbie Hancock * Footprints Live!

(group) members ","title":"Wayne Shorter"},{"id":"289578","text":"The Avro Shackleton is a British long-range maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) which was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the South African Air Force (SAAF). It was developed by Avro from the Avro Lincoln bomber, which itself had been a development of the famous wartime Avro Lancaster bomber. The Shackleton was developed during the late 1940s as part of Britain's military response to the rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy, in particular its submarine force. Produced as the primary type equipping RAF Coastal Command, the Type 696, as it was initially designated, incorporated major elements of the Lincoln, as well as the Avro Tudor passenger aircraft, and was furnished with extensive electronics suites in order to perform the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission along with a much-improved crew environment to accommodate the long mission times involved in patrol work. Being known for a short time as the Lincoln ASR.3, it was decided that the Type 696 would be named Shackleton in service, after the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. It entered operational service with the RAF in April 1951. The Shackleton was used primarily in the ASW and MPA roles, but it was also frequently deployed as an aerial search and rescue (SAR) platform and for performing several other secondary roles such as mail delivery and as a crude troop-transport aircraft. In addition to its service with the RAF, South Africa also elected to procure the Shackleton to equip the SAAF. In South African service, the type was operated in the maritime patrol capacity between 1957 and 1984. During March 1971, a number of SAAF Shackletons were used during the SS Wafra oil spill, intentionally sinking the stricken oil tanker using depth charges to prevent further ecological contamination. During the 1970s, the Shackleton was replaced in the maritime patrol role by the jet-powered Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. During its later life, a small number of the RAF's existing Shackletons received extensive modifications in order to adapt them to perform the airborne early warning (AEW) role. The type continued to be used in this support capacity until 1991, when it was replaced by the Boeing E-3 Sentry AEW aircraft. These were the last examples of the type remaining in active service. Development =Origins= The Battle of the Atlantic was a crucial element of the Second World War, in which Britain sought to protect its shipping from the German U-boat threat. The development of increasingly capable diesel-electric submarines had been rapid, in particular the snorkel virtually eliminated the need for submarines to surface while on patrol. Aircraft that had once been highly effective submarine-killers had very quickly become incapable in the face of these advances.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 67‚Äì68. In addition, lend-leased aircraft such as the Consolidated B-24 Liberator had been returned following the end of hostilities. Several Avro Lancasters had undergone rapid conversion ‚Äì designated as Maritime Reconnaissance Mk 3 (MR3) ‚Äì as a stopgap measure for maritime search and rescue and general reconnaissance duties;Jones 2002, pp. 22, 27. however, RAF Coastal Command had diminished to only a third of its size immediately after the Second World War.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 68‚Äì69. In the emerging climate of the Cold War and the potential requirement to guard the North Atlantic from an anticipated rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy's submarine force, a new aerial platform to perform the anti-submarine mission was required.Jones 2002, p. 43. Work had begun on the requirement for a new maritime patrol aircraft in 1944, at which point there had been an emphasis for long-range platforms for Far East operations; however, with the early end of the war in the Pacific, the requirement was refined considerably. In late 1945, the Air Staff had expressed interest in a conversion of the Avro Lincoln as general reconnaissance and air/sea rescue aircraft; they formalised their requirements for such an aircraft under Air Ministry specification R.5/46. Avro's Chief Designer Roy Chadwick initially led the effort to build an aircraft to this requirement, designated as the Avro Type 696.Billings, Bill. \\"The Shackleton Story.\\" The Shackleton Association. Retrieved: 10 July 2008. Interior of a Shackleton MR.3 The Type 696 was a significant development upon the Lincoln. Elements of the Avro Tudor airliner were also reused in the design; Lincoln and Tudor had been derivatives of the successful wartime Avro Lancaster bomber.Buttler 2004, p. 144.Jones 2002, p. 30. Crucially, the new aircraft was to be capable of a range while carrying up to of weapons and equipment. In addition to featuring a large amount of electronic equipment, the Type 696 had a much-improved crew environment over other aircraft types to allow them to be more effective during the lengthy mission times anticipated.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 70‚Äì71.Flight 18 May 1950, p. 611. During development the Type 696 was provisionally referred to as the Lincoln ASR.3 before the officially allocated name 'Shackleton' was selected. The first test flight of the prototype Shackleton GR.1, serial VW135, was made on 9 March 1949 from the manufacturer's airfield at Woodford, Cheshire in the hands of Avro's Chief Test Pilot J.H. \\"Jimmy\\" Orrell.Harlin and Jenks 1973, p. 164. The GR.1 was later redesignated \\"Maritime Reconnaissance Mark I\\" (MR 1). The prototype differed from subsequent production Shackletons in a number of areas; it featured a number of turrets and was equipped for air-to-air refuelling using the looped-line method. These did not feature on production aircraft due to judgments of ineffectiveness or performance difficulties incurred.Jones 2002, pp. 34, 36‚Äì37, 39. However, the performance of the prototype had been such that, in addition to the go-ahead for the MR1's production, a specification for improved variant was issued in December 1949, before the first production Shackleton had even flown.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 71‚Äì74. By 1951, the MR1 had become officially considered as an interim type due to several shortcomings.Jones 2002, p. 67. =Further development= 269 Squadron with dorsal turret in 1953 The MR 2 was an improved version of the Shackleton, featuring numerous refinements that had been proposed for the MR1. The radar was upgraded to ASV Mk 13, and the radome relocated from the aircraft's nose to a ventral position aft of the bomb bay, the radome was retractable and could be fully extended only with the bomb bay doors open. It had improved allround radar coverage and minimised the risk of bird strikes.World Aircraft Information Files 1997. Both the nose and tail section were lengthened, the tailplane was redesigned, the undercarriage was strengthened and twin- retractable tailwheels were fitted. The Bristol dorsal turret was initially retained, but was later removed from all aircraft after delivery.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 74‚Äì75. The prototype, VW 126, was modified as an aerodynamic prototype at the end of 1950 and first flew with the MR 2 modification on 19 July 1951. Shackleton MR.2 of No. 220 Squadron RAF in September 1955 VW 126 was tested at Boscombe Down in August 1951, particular attention being paid to changes made to improve its ground handling, such as the addition of toebrakes and a lockable rudder system. One production Mk 1 aircraft was modified on the line at Woodford with the Mk 2 changes and first flew on 17 June 1952. After trials were successful, it was decided to complete the last ten aircraft being built under the Mk 1 contract to MR 2 standard and further orders were placed for new aircraft. In order to keep pace with changing submarine threats, the Mk 2 force was progressively upgraded, with Phase I, II and III modifications introducing improved radar, weapons and other systems, as well as structural work to increase fatigue life. Production of the MR 2 ended in May 1954.Jones 2002, p. 85. The Type 716 Shackleton MR 3 was another redesign in response to crew feedback and observations. A new tricycle undercarriage was introduced, the fuselage was increased in all main dimensions and had new wings with better ailerons and tip tanks.Jones 2002, pp. 93, 95‚Äì96. The weapons capability was also upgraded to include homing torpedoes and Mk 101 Lulu nuclear depth bombs. To reduce crew fatigue on 15-hour flights, the sound deadening was improved and a proper galley and sleeping space were included. Due to these upgrades, the takeoff weight of the RAF's MR 3s had risen by over 30,000 lb (13,600 kg) (Ph. III) and assistance from Armstrong Siddeley Viper Mk 203 turbojets was needed on takeoff with a 5-minute limit. The Griffons had to be run at high power for very long periods after a heavyweight take-off so the Vipers were later cleared to run for four hours continuously so lower Griffon power settings could be used which reduced the risk of failures.The Shackleton, Chris Ashworth, Aston Publications Limited 1990, , p.44\\"Shackletons in the SAAF ‚Äì Retirement.\\" The Shackleton Project. Retrieved: 10 July 2008.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 77‚Äì78. The extra strain took a toll on the airframe, and flight life of the RAF MR 3s was so reduced that they were outlived by the MR 2s. Due to the arms embargo against South Africa, the SAAF's MR 3s never received these upgrades but were maintained independently by the SAAF. The Type 719 Shackleton IV, later known as the MR 4, was a projected variant intended to meet a Canadian requirement for a long-range patrol aircraft. The MR 4 would have been practically a new aircraft, sharing only the nose, cockpit, and outer wings with earlier variants; it would have also been powered by the Napier Nomad compound engine.Jefford et al. 2005, p. 88. The Shackleton IV was cancelled in 1955 and the Canadian requirement subsequently met by the Britannia Maritime Reconnaissance later to emerge as the Canadair Argus. In 1967, ten MR 2s were modified as training aircraft to replace the T 4 in-service with the Maritime Operational Training Unit; known as T 2s, the crew rest areas were replaced by additional radar equipment and the original radar fittings removed.Jones 2002, pp. 84‚Äì85. Design Front of a Shackleton AEW2. Note the contra-rotating propellers The Shackleton was a purpose-built aircraft for the maritime patrol role; however, the legacy of Avro's preceding aircraft is present in many aspects of the overall design. The centre section of the Shackleton's wing originates from the Lincoln, while the outer wing and undercarriage were sourced from the Tudor outer wings; at one stage during development, the tailplane had closely resembled the Lincoln's, but was enlarged and changed soon after. An entirely new fuselage was adopted, being wider and deeper to provide a large space in which to accommodate the crew, their equipment, and a large bomb bay.Jefford et al. 2005, p. 72.Jones 2002, p. 31. Later variants of the Shackleton were substantially redesigned, adopting a new nosewheel undercarriage, redesigned wings and centre-section, and a larger fuel capacity for more range.Jefford et al. 2005, p. 76. Various armaments and equipment were carried by the Shackleton in order to perform its missions. In ASW operations, the ASV Mk 13 radar was the primary detection tool; it could detect a destroyer at a range of , a surfaced submarine at , and a submarine's conning tower at , although rough seas considerably reduced the radar's effectiveness.Jones 2002, p. 34. Other equipment included droppable sonobuoys, electronic warfare support measures and an Autolycus diesel fume detection system. A special camera bay housed several reconnaissance cameras capable of medium altitude and nighttime vertical photography, and low-altitude oblique photography. The crew would also perform visual searches using various lookout positions that were provided for this purpose.Flight 18 May 1950, p. 617. Weapons carried included up to nine bombs, three homing torpedoes or depth-charges; the aircraft also had two 20 mm cannon in a Bristol dorsal turret. An in-flight refueling receptacle could be accommodated, but was not fitted on production aircraft.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 72‚Äì74. An RAF Shackleton in flight, 1978 The Merlin engines were replaced with the larger, more powerful and slower-revving Rolls-Royce Griffons with contra-rotating propellers. This engine's distinctive noise often caused crew members to develop high-tone deafness. The Griffon was needed because the Shackleton was heavier and had more drag than the Lincoln.Flight 18 May 1950, pp. 612‚Äì613, 616.Jones 2002, p. 33. The Griffon provided equivalent power to the Merlin but at lower engine speed, which led to reduced fuel consumption in the denser air at low altitudes; the Shackleton would often loiter for several hours at roughly or lower when searching for submarines. Lower-revving Griffons, compared to Merlins, reduced engine stress which improved their reliability. Using conventional propellers would have needed an increase in propeller diameter to absorb the engine's power and torque, this not being possible due to space limitations imposed by the undercarriage length and engine nacelle positioning; the contra-rotating propellers gave greater blade area within the same propeller diameter. Numerous problems were encountered during the Shackleton's operational service. In practice, the diesel fume detection system was prone to false alarms and thus received little operational use. The engines, hydraulics, and elements of the avionics were known for their unreliability, and the aircraft proved to be fairly maintenance-intensive. The prototype MR 3 was lost due to poor stalling characteristics; this was rectified prior to production, although a satisfactory stall-warning device was not installed until 1969. The Shackleton is often incorrectly assigned the unfortunate distinction of holding the record for the highest number of aircrew killed in one type in peacetime in the RAF.Jones 2002, p. 86. The true figures suggest rather differently in that some of its contemporaries fared far worse, such as the Gloster Meteor with over 430 fatal losses of aircrewhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Meteor-Eject-Recollections-Pioneer- Adventures/dp/1873203659 against the Shackleton's 156. Several programs to support and extend the fatigue life limits of the Shackleton's airframe were required; the fatigue life problems ultimately necessitated the rapid introduction of a whole new maritime patrol aircraft in the form of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, which began being introduced to RAF service in 1969.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 73, 77‚Äì78, 87‚Äì88. MR3 Co-pilot position Operational history =Royal Air Force= 8 Sqn RAF flew the Shackleton AEW 2 from 1973 to 1991. This example was pictured on 26 June 1982 On 30 March 1951, the first Shackleton was delivered to No. 120 Squadron RAF; by the end of 1952 seven squadrons were operating the type.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 70‚Äì72. The first operational deployment of the Shackleton occurred in 1955 as a troop-transport for British Army movements to Cyprus; less than a year later, the type's first combat deployment took place during the Suez Crisis, codenamed Operation Musketeer.Jones 2002, pp. 121‚Äì122.RAF Shackleton of 224 Squadron flying in formation during the 1954‚Äì1959 Jebel Akhdar War in Oman In 1957, British RAF Shackletons participated heavily during Jebel Akhdar War in Oman to expand the territory of the Sultanate, which was a de facto British colony,United Nations: 2302 Question of Oman. in order to gain access to oil wells in the interior parts of Oman. The RAF made 1,635 raids, dropping 1,094 tons and firing 900 rockets at the interior of Oman between July and December 1958 targeting insurgents, mountain top villages, water channels and crops in a war that remained under low profile.The Guardian: Britain‚Äôs secret warsBritish National Archives: Oman 1957-9. During the 1960s, the typical Shackleton crew comprised two pilots, two navigators, a flight engineer, an air electronics officer, and four air electronics operators.Jefford et al. 2005, p. 78. During this period, equipment upgrades had become routine in order to keep pace with ever more capable submarines; problems with airframe fatigue were identified, leading to several programmes being carried out to strengthen the aircraft and thus extend its viable service life. In 1966, nuclear depth charges were introduced to the Shackleton's arsenal with the aim of countering the Soviets' development of deep-diving submarines.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 70‚Äì72, 74‚Äì77. Maritime reconnaissance was a large element of the Shackleton's service. This mission was often performed to identify and monitor naval and merchant shipping and to demonstrate sovereignty. During the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation in the 1960s, Shackletons monitored the seas for vessels involved in arms smuggling. Similar operations were conducted in Cyprus, and Shackletons operating from bases in Madagascar cooperated with Royal Navy vessels to enforce a United Nation-mandated oil blockade of Rhodesia.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 82‚Äì83. RAF Shackleton performing a mail drop in July 1970 for Royal Navy ships on the \\"Beira Patrol\\", blockading Beira to prevent Rhodesian oil imports The Shackleton would often be used to perform search and rescue missions, at all times one crew being kept on standby somewhere across the UK for this role. The Shackleton had also replaced the Avro Lincoln in the colonial policing mission, aircraft often being stationed in the Aden Protectorate and Oman to carry out various support missions, including convoy escorting, supply dropping, photo reconnaissance, communication relaying, and ground-attack missions; the Shackleton was also employed in several short-term bombing operations.Jones 2002, p. 49. Other roles included weather reconnaissance and transport duties, in the latter role each Shackleton could carry freight panniers in the bomb bay or up to 16 fully equipped soldiers.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 83‚Äì87. In 1969, a jet-powered replacement patrol aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, began to enter RAF service, which was to spell the end for the Shackleton in most roles. While radically differing in external appearance, the Shackleton and the initial version of the Nimrod shared many sensor systems and onboard equipment.Jefford et al. 2005, pp. 75, 89. AN/APS-20 radar scanner The intention to retire the Shackleton was thwarted by the need to provide AEW coverage in the North Sea and northern Atlantic following the withdrawal of the Fleet Air Arm's Fairey Gannet aircraft used in the AEW role in the 1970s. As an interim replacement, the existing AN/APS-20 radar was installed in modified Shackleton MR 2s, redesignated the AEW 2, as an interim measure from 1972. These were operated by No. 8 Sqn, based at RAF Lossiemouth. All 12 AEW aircraft were given names from The Magic Roundabout and The Herbs TV series. The intended replacement, the British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3, suffered considerable development difficulties which culminated in the Nimrod AEW 3 being cancelled in favour of an off-the-shelf purchase of the Boeing E-3 Sentry, which allowed the last Shackletons to be retired in 1991.Tyack 2005, p. 87. =South African Air Force= SAAF 1717 0 on patrol, October 1982 During the Second World War, the importance of securing the sea routes around the Cape of Good Hope had been made apparent, with over a hundred vessels being sunk in South African waters by enemy vessels between 1942 and 1945.\\"The Shackleton in the SAAF.\\" saafmuseum.org.za, 23 February 2011. In the postwar situation, the South African Air Force sought a large and capable platform to perform the maritime patrol role. After evaluating four RAF MR 2s in 1953, an order was placed for eight Shackletons as a replacement for the SAAF's aging Short Sunderland maritime patrol aircraft. Modifications were required to fulfill South African conditions and requirements, such as the ability to operate over the Indian Ocean, the resulting aircraft was designated the Shackleton MR 3.\\"Shackletons in the SAAF ‚Äì Birth of a Legend.\\" The Shackleton project. Retrieved: 10 July 2008. Avro Shackleton Mk 3 at Ysterplaat AFB in South Africa, serial 1722, a.k.a. Pelican 22. Taken 27 May 2017 at engine run-up. No longer flying but considered mostly airworthy. On 18 August 1957, the first two Shackletons were delivered to D.F. Malan Airport, Cape Town. Two more followed on 13 October 1957 and the remainder arrived in February 1958. Delivered to the same basic standard as the RAF's MR 3s, they were assigned single letter codes between \\"J\\" and \\"Q\\" and operated by 35 Squadron SAAF. The type typically patrolled the sea lanes around the Cape of Good Hope, often monitoring Soviet vessels traversing between the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The Shackleton was briefly used in low-level overland patrols along the Southern Rhodesian border, but these duties ended following concerns of the disturbance of wildlife.Jones 2002, pp. 111‚Äì114. Often, the Shackleton would be called in to perform search and rescue operations in the treacherous waters around the Cape. In March 1971, Shackletons successfully intervened in the SS Wafra oil spill, deliberately sinking the stricken oil tanker with depth charges in order to prevent an ecological disaster.Jones 2002, pp. 114‚Äì115. The only operational loss incurred was 1718 K, which crashed into the Wemmershoek mountains at night time on 8 August 1963 with the loss of all thirteen crew. Due to an embargo imposed by the United Nations over South Africa's policy of apartheid, acquiring components for the Shackleton fleet became increasingly difficult and thus the aircraft's serviceability suffered. The fleet had been modified to Phase III standards prior to the implementation of the arms embargo, albeit without the auxiliary Viper engine. Two of the aircraft were re-sparred, 1716 J in the United Kingdom and 1717 O in South Africa by the SAAF, but the lack of engine spares and tyres, together with airframe fatigue, took a gradual toll. By November 1984, the fatigue lives of all but the two re-sparred aircraft had expired and the fleet was retired into storage. Although the joke has been applied to several aircraft, the Shackleton was often described as \\"a hundred thousand rivets flying in close formation.\\" \\"The Avro Shackelton and The SAAF Museum.\\" SAAF Museum, 21 February 2010.

She is a Vulcan who serves as the science officer aboard the starship Enterprise (NX-01). Concept and creation According to producer Rick Berman, it was originally intended that a younger version of T'Pau would be the Vulcan officer serving on the titular starship in Star Trek: Enterprise. Instead, after determining there were legal difficulties in using the original series character, the producers created T'Pol. Alt URL Overview T'Pol is the first Vulcan officer to serve a prolonged term on a human vessel. T'Pol served aboard the Enterprise for 10 years (2151‚Äì2161). To compare, the previous record was just 10 days. As a subcommander serving the Vulcan High Command, she was stationed aboard the Enterprise in April 2151, as an observer to Captain Jonathan Archer and his crew, who the High Command insisted were not ready for interstellar space exploration. After the success of the Enterprises initial mission led to the vessel being given an extended exploration mandate, T'Pol requested to stay aboard. T'Pol remained aboard the Enterprise despite several attempts by her superiors to recall her to Vulcan. T'Pol's decision brought considerable scrutiny upon her from her superiors, and increasing support for her from her captain; she ultimately resigned from the High Command and accepted a field commission from Starfleet in 2154, resulting in her being granted the Starfleet rank of Commander. Originally viewed by her crew mates with resentment and suspicion, T'Pol was forced to earn the trust of fellow officers, Commander Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker III being a particular focus of friction with her, due to his perception of her being a spy for the Vulcans and their very different personalities. The character of T'Pol developed from that of a \\"broken record\\" spouting the dogma of the Vulcan Science Council to that of a questioning scientific mind. Though she does not openly defy or reject the rulings of the Vulcan Science Council, her experiences on the Enterprise have proven to her that they can be wrong. (T'Pol had an especially hard time accepting the fact the Enterprise had traveled in time in \\"Storm Front, Part I\\" despite the overwhelming evidence proving that she had done so. The Vulcan Science Council had declared time travel to be impossible.) T'Pol is considerably more emotional than many other Vulcans and has always struggled to control her emotions, something that greatly concerned her mother. Her emotions became even more difficult to control following an exposure to trellium ore, a toxic substance which damaged the part of her brain responsible for emotional control. Nonetheless, T'Pol serves as an icon of Vulcan integrity. Her willingness to question the stale, self-serving decisions of her superiors (at least prior to the \\"Kir'Shara\\" incident), and her respect for Captain Archer position her at the fulcrum of human/Vulcan relations. Throughout the entire Enterprise run, T'Pol only once said the trademark Vulcan greeting \\"Live long and prosper\\". She also only once rendered the Vulcan hand salute, in the episode \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\". Biography =Before Enterprise= In Season 3, episode 24 \\"Zero Hour\\", while talking with Trip on February 14, 2154,On-air audio has Jolene Blalock‚Äôs voice-over, recording a log entry as acting captain T'Pol, mistakenly stating ‚ÄúFebruary 14, 2152‚Äù, despite earlier episodes running on-air log entries confirming that the timeline of the series had already moved through 2151, 2152, 2153 and into 2154. T'Pol states that she \\"will only be 66 years old\\" on her next birthday. This places her birth in 2088 or 2089 (as measured on Earth), making her 62 or 63 years old at \\"Broken Bow\\".According to actress Jolene Blalock, the original \\"series bible\\" for Enterprise indicated that T'Pol was 67 years old at the time of \\"Broken Bow\\". Series bibles are later updated when a character's specific information is established on screen. T'Pol was born the only child of T'Les, an instructor at the Vulcan Science Academy, and her (never named) husband. Per Vulcan tradition, T'Pol was bonded with a Vulcan named Koss while they were children and expected to marry as adults (\\"Breaking the Ice\\"). As a child, T'Pol's path in life was inspired by Ambassador V'Lar whom she watched negotiating with the Andorians during the Treaty of 2097 over possession of the planetoid Paan Mokar (\\"Fallen Hero\\"). Approximately 16 years before joining the crew of the Enterprise, T'Pol served as an agent for the Vulcan intelligence service. At age 47, she completed her training for the Vulcan Ministry of Security. During an early mission to apprehend a pair of Vulcan criminals, she was forced to shoot and kill one of the fleeing men. She resigned from the service as a result, and the guilt over killing someone face-to-face caused her to suffer a nervous breakdown or emotional collapse which led to her undergoing a procedure, the Fullara, that erased all memory of the incident. This \\"memory cap\\" disappeared when she was briefly reactivated as an agent during 2152 in order to capture the criminal Vulcan who eluded her that day, and she experienced another emotional collapse which was alleviated by the support of Captain Archer. Given the option to once again suppress her memory of killing, she chose to live with it instead (\\"The Seventh\\"). While in the Ministry of Security, T'Pol was also involved in mission operations at Tomed near Romulan space. Serving under her was Major Talok. However, unbeknownst to T'Pol, Talok was a Romulan spy disguised as a Vulcan working in league with corrupt Administrator V'Las of the Vulcan High Command. Their goal was to promote the eventual conquest of Vulcan by the Romulan Star Empire (\\"Kir'Shara\\"). After her resignation from the Ministry of Security, T'Pol served for over a year as the deputy science officer aboard the Vulcan cruiser Seleya, under the command of Captain Voris (\\"Impulse\\"). In 2149, T'Pol began her tenure at the High Command's Consulate on Earth, assisting Ambassador Soval in his observation of humanity's progress toward space exploration (\\"Fusion\\"). In 2151, then holding the rank of sub-commander, she was selected by Soval to accompany Captain Jonathan Archer during his initial first mission aboard the Enterprise NX-01 as observer and Vulcan representative. When the mission was successful and the Enterprise greenlighted to continue its mission of exploration, T'Pol elected to remain on board as science officer (\\"Broken Bow\\"). =Pa'nar, trellium, mind melds, and emotion= T'Pol, who is described by her superiors as a maverick and a rebel, became fascinated with Tolaris, a member of a group of emotionally free Vulcans encountered during the first year of the Enterprises mission. Tolaris introduced her to the concept of the mind meld, which at the time was considered a taboo activity among Vulcans. She severed her relationship with Tolaris after she asked him to stop the mind meld and he refused, attempting to continue the meld without her consent (essentially a form of mental rape), and causing her to forcefully break the link. She later learned that she had contracted Pa'nar Syndrome from the encounter. This condition was kept in check with medication. In 2154, T'Pol, who had been told that Pa'nar was an incurable virus, learned that the condition was in fact caused by an improperly trained melder, and contrary to what the intolerant (and soon to be overthrown) Vulcan High Command had decreed, it was indeed curable by the touch of an experienced mind - provided to T'Pol by T'Pau. T'Pol was told that she is genetically incapable of initiating mind melds herself, however following the 2154 overthrow of the Vulcan regime that stigmatized mind- melding she learned otherwise. She performed her first mind meld upon Hoshi Sato, with the assistance of Jonathan Archer, who had learned details about mind melds during a period of time when he held the katra of Surak. In fact, not only is T'Pol telepathic, but the episode \\"Affliction\\" revealed that she is able to communicate with Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker III over great distances using her new-found mental abilities. It was established a year later (in \\"Bound\\") that this is because of a mating bond between the two. During T'Pol's early years aboard the Enterprise, she demonstrated an unusual (for a Vulcan) willingness to explore human culture and customs, although she stated that certain human foods do not agree with her. After a discussion with Commander Charles Tucker, she sampled pecan pie, a dessert she initially dismissed as being \\"mostly sugar\\". She began attending the ship's weekly film night social event (with Captain Archer), and expressed particular admiration for the 1931 film Frankenstein. She was reportedly less successful at mastering the art of eating with chopsticks, to the amusement of her crew mates (in one episode, Trip refers to her efforts as \\"dinner and a show\\"). Prior to her posting aboard the Enterprise, T'Pol on at least one occasion left the Vulcan Compound in San Francisco and visited a jazz music club; the chaotic music generated an emotional response that came back to haunt her during a brief period when she abandoned her nightly meditation ritual (concurrent with her experimentation with mind-melding). T'Pol also became adept at \\"play acting\\", which she found was often needed in order to successfully fulfill a mission. For example, she once pretended to be a slave when Ferengi pirates hijacked the Enterprise (\\"Acquisition\\"), distracted a group of Suliban invaders by acting deranged (\\"Shockwave (Part II)\\"), and pretended to be a domineering Vulcan commander preparing for an execution (\\"Precious Cargo\\"). In the latter example there is a clear indication that T'Pol enjoyed taking part in this sort of deception. On several occasions during her first two years aboard the Enterprise, T'Pol resisted efforts by her family and the Vulcan High Command to get her to leave the ship and return to her Vulcan obligations. When pressed for a reason by Vulcan Ambassador Soval, T'Pol replied that she found working aboard the Enterprise \\"gratifying\\", for which she was chided for engaging in an emotional indulgence. In 2153, after being ordered to leave the Enterprise and return to Vulcan, T'Pol resigned her commission with the Vulcan High Command in order to accompany the crew of the Enterprise into the Delphic Expanse to find the Xindi, a mysterious race accused of killing seven million humans on Earth. Despite being technically a civilian, she remained as first officer of the Enterprise and the crew continued to refer to her by her High Command rank of Sub-Commander during the mission. While investigating the Vulcan ship Seleya (\\"Impulse\\"), which had become trapped in The Expanse, T'Pol experienced the side effects of Trellium-D, a compound the ship had used to protect itself from anomalies within The Expanse, but which had the side effect of creating psychosis in Vulcans. T'Pol's brief exposure led to her experiencing extreme paranoia and losing control of her emotions. She recovered upon returning to the Enterprise. The compound, which Commander Tucker brought aboard, was necessary to line the ship so that the Enterprise could traverse the Expanse. Captain Archer, rather than line the ship with the concoction (lethal to T'Pol), stored it in a locker in the cargo bay. T'Pol, however, found herself wanting to experience more of the emotions the Trellium-D had unlocked. In \\"Damage\\", it is revealed that she discovered how to liquefy small, safe amounts of the compound and began to secretly inject herself with it, beginning approximately three months prior to the Enterprise arriving at Azati Prime (\\"Azati Prime\\"). This led to what she felt was improved relations with her crew mates, in particular chief engineer Trip Tucker, which led to a sexual relationship in \\"Harbinger\\" after she understood she was experiencing jealousy when Tucker began making romantic overtures toward a MACO on board. In the same episode, she later attempted to deflect the importance of the act by referring to it as merely an exploration of human sexuality. However, this one-time encounter resulted in the formation of a psychic bond between Trip and T'Pol which doesn't manifest until the second half of season 4. Over time, as T'Pol became addicted to the Trellium-D injections, her emotions began to flow more freely. This came to a head when the Enterprise reached Azati Prime (\\"Azati Prime\\") and Jonathan Archer chose to undertake a suicide mission in order to complete the Xindi mission. T'Pol's emotional reaction toward Archer's departure and presumed death incapacitated her as a commanding officer (ending up in crying and an attempt to recover him). She attempted to hide her condition, and the Enterprise was nearly destroyed in a subsequent Xindi attack which may or may not have been made worse by T'Pol's state. After the attack, T'Pol's supply of Trellium-D became difficult to reach (being located in a heavily damaged part of the ship) and she nearly died during a clandestine attempt to retrieve it. Soon after, she lost her temper with Archer (who had since returned to the Enterprise). He indicated he needed her for a difficult (and morally questionable) mission. She was nearly killed while trying to recover more Trellium-D after experiencing an erotic dream involving Tucker. This led her to seek medical help from Dr. Phlox to whom she confessed her addiction. Although T'Pol subsequently overcame her addiction, Phlox determined that she had permanently damaged her brain, and as a result might never achieve the same level of emotional control she once had. A subsequent encounter with an elderly version of herself (due to an Expanse- related anomaly seen in the episode \\"E¬≤\\" - an alternate universe episode) indicated that she will live with the after effects of her Trellium-D exposure for the rest of her life. The older version of T'Pol served aboard an alternate time line version of the Enterprise, which had been transported into the past. Aboard the alternate Enterprise, T'Pol and Trip Tucker had married and conceived a son, Lorian, who at the time of the encounter was the captain of the alternate Enterprise. The older T'Pol advised her that Trip Tucker could provide a safe outlet for her newfound emotions if she could learn to trust him. She also advised her younger self that she could not imagine what her life would have been like without him. However, T'Pol did not choose to pursue a romantic/sexual relationship with Trip when the Enterprise returned to normal space in the Expanse. Following the Xindi mission, she continued to experience difficulty controlling her emotions and became particularly emotional following the death of her mother (as seen in the episodes \\"Awakening\\" and \\"Kir'Shara\\"). T'Pol, who (at the time) held the record for the longest time spent by a Vulcan serving with humans, has demonstrated her ability to adapt. Originally, she required a form of medication in order to tolerate the odors given off by humans and Captain Archer's pet dog Porthos (because of Vulcans having a sensitive sense of smell). It's revealed that she has a sense of humor, one she can demonstrate (as she has in \\"Future Tense\\" and other shows, including \\"Bound\\"). And, in a case of \\"when in Rome, do as the Romans do,\\" she has also begun eating some types of foods (fruit, popcorn) with her hands, breaking a long-standing Vulcan taboo in the process. Following the death of her mother (see below), the divorce of her husband Koss and the discovery of the Kir'Shara, T'Pol began to re-evaluate Surak's teachings and what it means to be Vulcan. As a result, she began to distance herself from some of her crew mates, choosing to spend her free time studying the newly found word of Surak. Her decision had an adverse effect on her relationship with Commander Tucker. (In \\"Bound\\", however, she re-established her romantic relationship with Trip. T'Pol asked Trip to return to the Enterprise and, when he replied that he \\"would think about it\\" she showed her emotional commitment by pursuing him down the corridor and kissing him.) She has also experienced some success in controlling her emotions to a greater degree than she had over the two years. T'Pau's therapeutic mind-meld cured the Pa'nar Syndrome and may have helped restore some of her emotional balance as well. This, combined with the fact that T'Pol no longer has the added stress of living with an incurable, potentially fatal condition, may have calmed her mind sufficiently to maintain control. Despite this, she has admitted to Phlox that she had never before felt so unsure of herself. =Relationship with Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker III= The relationship between T'Pol and Trip Tucker is a complex one. Initially, the two had a somewhat combative association. During the third season of Enterprise, while the ship was engaged in pursuing the Xindi weapon in the Expanse, T'Pol and Tucker became increasingly intimate. This process began because Trip had trouble sleeping (due to his sister's death when the Xindi first attacked Earth with a prototype of the Xindi weapon). Dr. Phlox urged T'Pol to assist Trip by using Vulcan neuropressure, a system of massage that T'Pol referred to as \\"intimate\\" and which is frequently conducted in a semi-clothed state. A few episodes after this, starting in \\"Impulse\\", T'Pol begins to take Trellium-D, which has the result of lowering her barriers and producing greater emotion. In \\"Similitude\\", when Doctor Phlox grows a mimetic symbiote of Tripcomplete with Trip's memoriesthe Sim confessed to T'Pol that he (they?) had a deep attraction to her. In \\"Harbinger\\", a few months after Trellium-D usage and neuropressure sessions, T'Pol learns that Trip is attracted to a MACO aboard the Enterprise. T'Pol begins to display signs of jealousy regarding Trip's activities with another woman aboard the Enterprise and Trip is jealous of Sim for having been the one to admit ‚Äútheir‚Äù feelings for herultimately, she and Trip have sex. Afterward, T'Pol attempts to distance herself from the act by referring to it as an exploration of human sexuality. After they engage in sex in \\"Harbinger\\", they do not engage in the act again in season 3. In \\"E¬≤\\", an alternate timeline is revealed where Commander Tucker and T'Pol get married and have at least one child, who they meet, called Lorian. It creates an awkward situation but further illuminates their relationship. In \\"Zero Hour\\", T'Pol reveals her age to him, which she indicated Vulcans consider \\"intimate\\" information. In Home, at the end of the Xindi mission, when Trip tells her he has no home left to go to, T'Pol invites him to accompany her home to Vulcan. After arriving on Vulcan, T'Pol is blackmailed into marrying her original betrothed, Koss, in order to save her mother's career. Her mother, T'Les, realizes Trip is in love with her daughter and suggests to him he should express his feelings to T'Pol before the ceremony so that she could have all available information. Trip declines, saying that she is under enough stress and he cares about her too much to make things even more difficult for her. However, T'Pol was not unaware of his feelings. She paused on her way to marry Koss long enough to give Trip a kiss on the cheek, a scandalous public display of affection for a Vulcan, especially in those circumstances. In \\"Kir'Shara,\\" following the discovery of the Kir'Shara in season four, T'Pol's husband divorces her and Trip attempts to reconnect their relationship. T'Pol is studying the original teachings of Surak, and disregards that request. Hurt, Trip decides to make a new start and transfers to Enterprises sister ship NX-02 Columbia, then working up prior to being commissioned. While he is away on Columbia, both he and T'Pol experience telepathic contact in the form of both waking daydreams as well as dreams while sleeping. An emergency requires Trip to return to the Enterprise. While he is aboard an attempted takeover by Orions reveals that Trip is the only human aboard who is immune to the pheromones emitted by the Orion women, which proves to T'Pol they have bonded. An undetermined amount of time after the two learn of their bond, their relationship undergoes a major shock during the Terra Prime episodes when Trip and T'Pol learn that they have a child. The baby was a binary clone created using stolen DNA samples of the two by a terrorist group headed by a radical separatist, Paxton, who believed Earth should distance itself and defend itself from alien worlds and influences. The baby, a girl, was named Elizabeth after Trip's sister (who was killed in the Xindi attack on Earth). As stated by Phlox, the child has Trip's eyes and T'Pol's ears. Elizabeth does not survive due to a flawed procedure during the cloning process. Trip revealed this to T'Pol when he went to her quarters to try to console her. He further indicated that according to Phlox, a different cloning process performed by gene surgeons who were more highly skilled than those employed by Terra Prime would probably result in a viable child. The two grieved together for Elizabeth, whom they had accepted as theirs. =Relationship with Jonathan Archer= When T'Pol first reported to duty aboard the Enterprise, Archer resented her assignment due to his distrust of Vulcans and the fact that the Vulcans had refused to provide starcharts and a copy of the Vulcan database unless T'Pol was assigned to the crew. T'Pol would butt heads with Archer about his style of command during the ship's early missions, chastising him for taking chances just to be able to explore new planets. As time passed, T'Pol proved to be a valuable asset to Archer due to her time in space and her past experiences as an officer with command experience. Indeed, her command experience is what secured her position as First Officer. As Enterprises mission progressed, T'Pol grew very close to Captain Jonathan Archer whose abilities she had come to respect and to whom she had developed a sense of loyalty after he assisted her in bringing to justice a renegade Vulcan Security agent. Her sense of loyalty went so far as to compel her to resign her position with Vulcan High Command and join Enterprise without a commission from either Starfleet or the Vulcans during her mission in the Delphic Expanse. During the Delphic Expanse mission, T'Pol continued to serve as First Officer despite her not holding a commission. After the Delphic Expanse mission, T'Pol opted to remain with Starfleet and with Archer's assistance; bypassed Starfleet training, was directly commissioned with the rank of Commander, and was formally assigned as Archer's First Officer. On the occasions when Archer was thought killed, T'Pol showed her affection for him to the point of crying during the Xindi mission when she believes he has been killed in \\"Azati Prime\\". She also grieves in \\"Zero Hour\\", when she believes he is dead, by holding close a book of his and pets his dog, Porthos (whose smell, as mentioned above, she originally could not stand). In one alternate timeline (depicted in \\"Twilight\\"), T'Pol devoted her life to caring for Archer when parasites robbed him of the ability to store long-term memory (the same ones with which he was infected while saving her life). It was later implied by Dr. Phlox that T'Pol had fallen in love with Archer during the time that she took care of him. =Starfleet service= Near the end of the Xindi mission, T'Pol revealed to Archer and Tucker that she was considering enlisting in Starfleet. Following the Xindi mission, she accepted the commission and received the rank of Commander. In May 2154, T'Pol officially assumed duties as a Starfleet officer. However, as she does not wear a standard Starfleet uniform, it is suggested that her relationship with the organization is a unique one. (There is precedent for a Starfleet officer not to wear a regulation uniform, however: Montgomery Scott in The Original Series wore a kilt instead of regulation trousers with his dress uniform; Deanna Troi in Star Trek: The Next Generation only wore regulation uniform during seasons six and seven (followed by all the movies starring the TNG crew); and Worf wore a Klingon sash with his uniform throughout his Starfleet career on both USS Enterprise and Deep Space Nine. However, these series take place in later centuries than Star Trek: Enterprise). The final episode \\"These Are the Voyages...\\" reveals that T'Pol remained Archer's first officer aboard the Enterprise for a total of 10 years. Her relationship with Trip allegedly ended at some point within a year of the death of their cloned child in 2155 (see \\"Family\\", below), although she remained emotionally attached to him and expressed concern that she would never see Trip again after the decommissioning of the Enterprise in 2161. Trip's death on a minor mission just prior to the decommissioning affected her deeply, and she expressed a desire to meet his parents. She also grew comfortable in confiding in the ship's chef during the years prior to the finale. Dialog in the finale suggests that T'Pol was to be assigned to another vessel following the decommissioning of the Enterprise, implying that she remained a Starfleet officer for some time after 2161. In the Star Trek novels released following the formation of the United Federation of Planets it is stated that T'Pol was promoted to Captain and given command of the newly commissioned NX-class starship USS Endeavour, NX-06. T'Pol's ultimate fate has yet to be revealed. Given a Vulcan's life expectancy of approximately 250 years, it is possible that she is still alive at the time of Star Trek: The Original Series and subsequent films. Family Little is revealed of T'Pol's family until the fourth-season episode \\"Home\\", in which her mother T'Les appears. T'Pol's father is deceased. T'Les was an instructor at the Vulcan Science Academy, but resigned in 2154. In the episode \\"Awakening\\", she died in her daughter's arms during an attack on a Syrranite encampment in the desert region known as The Forge. T'Pol grieved upon her mother's death; following the death of Trip in 2161, she confessed to Archer that she missed her mother more as time went by. T'Pol has no siblings. As a child she had a pet sehlat. T'Pol was engaged to marry a Vulcan named Koss prior to the start of the Enterprises mission, with the marriage scheduled for 2151 (about a week after the events of \\"Breaking the Ice\\" to be precise) but elected to delay her marriage indefinitely. The fourth-season episode \\"Home\\" saw T'Pol having to deal with the consequences of her decision, when she chooses to marry Koss in order to save her mother's professional reputation. She appears to be unaware that Trip has fallen in love with her (although in \\"The Augments\\" it is clear that she is beginning to realize his feelings). Prior to her marriage, she negotiated with Koss' family to defer the one-year Vulcan residence obligation required of newly-wed Vulcan females, in order to join Starfleet as a commissioned officer and stay aboard the Enterprise. Only a couple of months after their marriage, Koss released T'Pol from their marriage arrangement (effectively granting her a divorce) following the death of her mother. The marriage was officially annulled some weeks later (per the episode \\"Babel One\\"). In the episode \\"Carbon Creek\\", T'Pol tells Captain Archer and Commander Tucker a story about the Vulcans' real first contact with humanity on Earth in the 1950s. T'Mir (T'Pol's great grandmother) was involved in a survey mission when her spacecraft crash landed on Earth in 1957. She and two other Vulcan crew members were forced to live among humans for several months in a small American mining town called Carbon Creek, hiding their Vulcan identity. During her stay, T'Mir provided a patent office with a revolutionary material (Velcro), in order to raise college tuition money for a human teenager whom she had befriended in town. T'Pol kept her great-grandmother's purse. In the alternate timeline seen in \\"E¬≤\\", T'Pol marries Trip and they have a son, Lorian, who becomes the captain of the Enterprise upon the death of Captain Archer. The fate of Lorian following the restoration of the timeline is not known. In this same episode, T'Pol met an older version of herself (approximately 180 years old). The fate of \\"Old T'Pol\\" is also unknown. The fourth-season episode \\"Demons\\" revealed that T'Pol had a six-month-old daughter, the father being Trip. It was later learned that a terrorist group called Terra Prime had created the child by cloning. Samples of T'Pol and Trip's DNA stolen from the Enterprise were the source of the child's genetic material. The cloning procedure, however, was not performed correctly. The child -- whom T'Pol named Elizabeth in honor of Trip's deceased sister -- died soon after being rescued from the Mars facility where she was being held. The existence of a psychic bond between T'Pol and Trip is revealed during the fourth season; no such psychic bond is indicated between T'Pol and Koss. The final episode, \\"These Are the Voyages...\\", mentioned that T'Pol and Trip ended their relationship within a year of the events of \\"Terra Prime\\". Outside of established Star Trek canon, novels have been published based on the series that retconned this, saying that the two are still involved with each other. The book The Romulan War: To Brave the Storm states that T'Pol has two children ‚Äì a daughter T'Mir and a son Lorian. The father may be Trip, but that is unclear. Mirror Universe A two-part episode in the fourth season, \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\", introduced a Mirror Universe version of T'Pol. This version is more cynical and openly emotional than her \\"real universe\\" counterpart, and is also openly sexually manipulative, particularly of Commander Tucker. In the Mirror Universe, T'Pol underwent pon farr at some point in the recent past, and Trip mated with her in order to get her through it. Physically, she differs from her real universe counterpart in that she has long hair (in reality, Blalock went without her wig and showed her normal hair) and, like other female officers in the Terran Empire, she wears a two- piece uniform with a bare midriff (although after transferring to the captured USS Defiant (NCC-1764), she adopts a TOS-style miniskirt uniform temporarily until she is able to obtain a more standard Empire uniform). Mirror-T'Pol's mind meld abilities appear to be somewhat more advanced than those of her counterpart, as she is capable of placing a form of post-hypnotic suggestion into the minds of those with whom she melds; since the real universe T'Pol had only recently learned how to meld, it is unlikely she had yet achieved this level of melding proficiency. She also appears to be more emotional than her counterpart, showing open sarcasm and contempt for Archer, and is seen to either grin or snarl (depending on one's point of view) during a brief bout of hand-to-hand combat with Hoshi Sato. Eventually, Mirror-T'Pol is forcibly transferred from the Defiant to the ISS Avenger when Jonathan Archer attempts to rid his ship of all alien crew members. T'Pol becomes convinced that Archer will never allow Vulcans to be equals, and tries to stop him from taking over the Empire. Mirror-T'Pol was inspired by reading the historical logs of our universe's Defiant, which revealed a universe where Humans, Vulcans, and other aliens lived as equals in a benevolent Federation. After recruiting the ISS Avengers alien crew members to the rebellion, T'Pol is caught and interrogated by Archer. Her ultimate fate is not revealed; although both Archer and Hoshi Sato express a desire to have her executed following her interrogation, the Defiant immediately enters battle and this does not occur on screen. During the episode's stated date of January 2155, T'Pol foreshadows future events, such as the fall of the Terran Empire after several centuries (which would be chronicled in the Mirror Universe episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.) Reception In 2018, The Wrap ranked T'Pol as the 28th best character of Star Trek overall, noting it was fun to watch the Vulcan grapple with their emotions.https://www.thewrap.com/all-39-star-trek-main-characters-ranked-from- spock-to-wesley-photos/ In 2016, W.I.R.E.D. magazine ranked T'Pol as the 10th most important character of Starfleet within the Star Trek science fiction universe.https://www.wired.com/2016/09/star-treks-100-crew-members-ranked/ In 2017, Screen Rant ranked T'Pol the 8th most attractive person in the Star Trek universe.

He led a coup in 1980, but was resisted by trade unions and was overthrown by Major Jean- Baptiste Ou√©draogo and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). Biography Saye Zerbo was born Tougan, French West Africa, on 27 August 1932. He went to school in Mali and Saint-Louis, Senegal. Then he joined the French military in 1950 and attended the military academy Saint-Cyr. As a paratrooper, Zerbo took part in both the First Indochina War and the Algerian War of Independence. After Upper Volta's independence from France in 1960, he transferred to that country's army in 1961. In the military government of Sangoul√© Lamizana, who ruled Upper Volta from 1966, Saye Zerbo was minister of foreign affairs from 1974 to 1976. He also held the positions of commander of the regiment in the capital Ouagadougou and director of the military intelligence agency. On 25 November 1980, Zerbo staged a coup against President Lamizana, who had been re-elected democratically in 1978, and took on the positions of head of state and government. The constitution, which had been introduced in 1977, was suspended and the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress (Comit√© Militaire de Redressement pour le Progr√®s National; CMPRN) established. The trade unions in the country opposed his seizure of power, although they had supported Zerbo for a long time, and on 7 November 1982, Saye Zerbo was deposed in another coup d'√©tat. He was succeeded by Jean-Baptiste Ou√©draogo as the head of the Council of Popular Salvation (Conseil du Salut du Peuple; CSP). After being deposed, Zerbo was also incarcerated. On 4 August 1983, Ou√©draogo was deposed by Thomas Sankara. In May 1984, Zerbo and Lamizana were put on trial for various crimes. Zerbo was sentenced to 15 years in prison. During his imprisonment, Zerbo converted from Islam to Christianity.Saye Zerbo, pr√©sident of the republic from 1980 to 1982 (article in French) \\"At once stopped, Saye Zerbo is thrown in prison. After his imprisonment, the deposed president contemplated and read the Qu'ran through whole nights. He also asked for the Bible that the archbishop of Ouagadougou, the cardinal Paul Zoungrana, had offered to him at the time of the first Christmas following his takeover. At this point in time he had the revelation which changed his life. In a mystical dash, Saye Zerbo was brought to his knees, returned thanks to God and converted to Christianity. His entire family did the same thing thereafter.\\" He was released from jail in August 1985. After Blaise Compaor√© had deposed Sankara he sought Zerbo's advice. Zerbo's conviction from 1984 was annulled on 18 February 1997 by the supreme court of Burkina Faso. Zerbo's third daughter Araba Kadidiatou Zerbo is married to the former Prime Minister of Burkina Faso Paramanga Ernest Yonli.

He held the additional position of Prime Minister from February 8, 1974, to July 7, 1978.  Biography  After Upper Volta achieved complete independence from the French Union in 1960, opposition parties either merged with the governing party, Union d√©mocratique volta√Øque (UDV), or were banned, transforming Upper Volta into a single party state, headed by Maurice Yam√©ogo as President. Yam√©ogo's one-party regime elicited much unrest; student strikes and mass demonstrations by students, labor unions, and civil servants. Yam√©ogo was forced to resign after a general strike on January 3, 1966, giving power to General Sangoul√© Lamizana on the demonstrators' demand. Lamizana served as nominal head of a \\"provisional military government\\" until a new Constitution, ratified on June 14, 1970, provided for a four-year transition to fully civilian elected leadership; he was also foreign minister from 1966 to 1967. Elections under the new Constitution delivered a clear majority of the assembly to the UDV. In the early 1970s the effect of a five-year drought and increasing desertification in the Sahel brought the threat of famine to several nations including Upper Volta. The resulting economic dislocation encouraged factionalism in the government, headed by G√©rard Ou√©draogo, the prime minister who had been appointed by Lamizana. Again military intervention and dissolution of the assembly brought Lamizana back in control, essentially now as dictator. Lamizana's regime had international recognition and visited with U.S. President Richard Nixon. On 15 October, 1973 Lamizana met with President Nixon and briefed him on the Sahel drought in the Oval Office.File:Nixon, Upper Volta President Lamizana - October 15, 1973(Gerald Ford Library)(1552621).pdf Lamizana explained that he represented himself and the other Sahel governments and hoped to secure aid during the famine and drought. Nixon promised to provide as much help as he could. His personal party following was styled the National Movement for Renewal, although that became a short-lived formation. A new Constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected in open elections in 1978: this election is generally considered as being among the most democratic ever held in West Africa. Later Lamizana joined UDV. With the support of unions and civil groups, Col. Saye Zerbo overthrew Lamizana in a bloodless military coup in November 1980.

It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the UK on 1 April 1965, eight months after the author's death. The novel was not as detailed or polished as the others in the series, leading to poor but polite reviews. Despite that, the book was a best-seller. The story centres on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond, who had been posted missing, presumed dead, after his last mission in Japan. Bond returns to Britain via the Soviet Union, where he had been brainwashed to attempt to assassinate his superior, M. After being \\"cured\\" by the MI6 doctors, Bond is sent to the Caribbean to find and kill Francisco Scaramanga, the titular \\"Man with the Golden Gun\\". The first draft and part of the editing process was completed before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not used. The novel was serialised in 1965, firstly in the Daily Express and then in Playboy; in 1966 a daily comic strip adaptation was also published in the Daily Express. In 1974 the book was loosely adapted as the ninth film in the Eon Productions James Bond series, with Roger Moore playing Bond and Fleming's cousin, Christopher Lee, as Scaramanga. Plot A year after James Bond's final confrontation with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, while on a mission in Japan, a man claiming to be Bond appears in London and demands to meet the head of the Secret Service, M. Bond's identity is confirmed, but during his debriefing interview with M, Bond tries to kill him with a cyanide pistol; the attempt fails. The Service learns that after destroying Blofeld's castle in Japan, Bond suffered a head injury and developed amnesia. Having lived as a Japanese fisherman for several months, Bond travelled into the Soviet Union to learn his true identity. While there, he was brainwashed and assigned to kill M upon returning to England. Now de- programmed, Bond is given a chance to again prove his worth as a member of the 00 section following the assassination attempt. M sends Bond to Jamaica and gives him the seemingly impossible mission of killing Francisco \\"Pistols\\" Scaramanga, a Cuban assassin who is believed to have killed several British secret agents. Scaramanga is known as \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" because his weapon of choice is a gold-plated Colt .45 revolver, which fires silver- jacketed solid-gold bullets. Bond locates Scaramanga in a Jamaican bordello and manages to become his temporary personal assistant under the name \\"Mark Hazard\\". He learns that Scaramanga is involved in a hotel development on the island with a group of investors that consists of a syndicate of American gangsters and the KGB. Scaramanga and the other investors are also engaged in a scheme to destabilise Western interests in the Caribbean's sugar industry and increase the value of the Cuban sugar crop, running drugs into America, smuggling prostitutes from Mexico into America and operating casinos in Jamaica that will cause friction between tourists and the local people. Bond discovers that he has an ally who is also working undercover at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up bugs in Scaramanga's meeting room. However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, with the help of Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden in his palm. Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him at last. Characters and themes The central character of the novel is James Bond. In The Man with the Golden Gun, he appears with a different personality from the previous stories and is robot-like, according to author of the \\"continuation\\" Bond novels, Raymond Benson. Benson also felt that Bond's character had not been developed any further than in the previous books. Academic Jeremy Black noted that when given two opportunities to kill Scaramanga in cold blood, he cannot bring himself to do it. The first time this happens, Bond sits in a car behind Scaramanga; the method of killing would be to shoot him in the back of the head and this is compared to the technique used by both the KGB and Nazis. According to Black, Bond has to rise above the actions and act more suitably for a British fictional hero. Once the mission is completed, Bond is offered the KCMG, but he refuses the honour and reflects on his own name, \\"a quiet, dull, anonymous name\\", which had been Fleming's aim when he first named the character. Benson also points out that the touches of humour displayed by Bond in the previous novels disappeared and he appeared in the book as cold and emotionless. For the first time in the Bond canon, M's full name of \\"Admiral Sir Miles Messervy KCMG\\" was finally revealed. Despite being the target of the failed assassination attempt, not only does M not press charges against Bond, he sends him out on further missions. According to Benson, the main adversary of the novel, Francisco Scaramanga, is more a henchman than a major adversary and \\"a second-rate, smalltime crook who happens to have gotten lucky with his shooting.\\" Comentale, Watt and Willman note that Scaramanga had the same character profile as Herr von Hammerstein, the former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counterintelligence for the Cuban secret service in \\"For Your Eyes Only\\". There are two main themes in the novel. The first involves Scaramanga providing the Rastafarians with drugs in return for fires in the sugar plantations, a return of the theme used in \\"Risico\\", of drugs being used for political purposes to undermine the West. This was part of a wider conspiracy by Scaramanga and his KGB connection, Hendricks, to destabilise the region by a campaign of industrial sabotage against companies based in Jamaica, including Reynolds Metal, Kaiser Bauxite and Aluminia. Jeremy Black notes that the independent inquiry at the end of the novel, conducted in Bond's hospital bedroom, was undertaken by the Jamaican judiciary and the CIA and MI6 were recorded as acting \\"under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican CID\\"; Bond and Leiter are also awarded the Jamaican Police Medal for \\"Services to the Independent State of Jamaica.\\" Black observes that this was the new world of a non-colonial, independent Jamaica, underlining the collapse of the British Empire. Background thumbright200pxalt=a single story white building with a grey roof and palm trees in the background Fleming's house, Goldeneye, where he wrote all the Bond novels, including The Man with the Golden Gun Ian Fleming wrote The Man with the Golden Gun at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January and February 1964, completing it by the beginning of March. His health affected him badly during the writing process and he dropped from his usual rate of two thousand words a morning to a little over an hour's worth of work a day. As with his previous novels, Fleming used events from his past as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzb√ºhel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing and he had been dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Live and Let Die, Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love. As well as using events from his past, Fleming also used names of individuals he knew for some of his characters. The editor of The London Magazine, Alan Ross, had provided Fleming with details about the effects of the electroshock therapy that Bond went through and, by way of thanks, the novel's SIS station chief in Jamaica, Commander Ross, was named after him. Similarly, Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George's Golf Club, Mark Nicholson, for the CIA representative at the hotel. Tony Hugill, the sugar planter mentioned in the novel, was named after a member of Fleming's 30 AU unit who managed the Tate & Lyle plantations in the West Indies after the war and the book's main villain, Francisco Scaramanga, was named after George Scaramanga, an Etonian contemporary of Fleming's: the pair are said to have fought at school. The effects of the two Eon Productions Bond films released prior to the writing of the novel (Dr. No and From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in the scene of the attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison- spray gun to do it. Fleming returned to Britain with a completed first draft of the manuscript in March 1964 and wrote to the copy editor of all his novels, William Plomer, saying it needed a lot of re-writing. As time went on Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and thought about re-working it in the spring of 1965, but was persuaded against it by Plomer, who considered the novel viable for publication. Five months after returning from Jamaica, on the morning of 12 August 1964, Fleming died of a heart attack. His obituary in The Times noted that he \\"had completed and was revising a new novel, The Man with the Golden Gun.\\" Despite William Plomer's original thought about the state of the manuscript, editors Jonathan Cape were concerned enough about the story to pass the manuscript to Kingsley Amis to read on holiday, paying him ¬£35/15 shillings for his thoughts and advice, although Amis' subsequent suggestions were not used by Cape. Cape had taken the step because they thought the novel was thin and \\"feeble\\". Raymond Benson has noted that the thinness comes from a lack of the rich detail and descriptions which are normally present in Fleming's work, but which are missing from The Man with the Golden Gun; Benson suggests that these details were normally worked into the second draft by Fleming, but their absence shows that no such additional work was done on this occasion. The Man with the Golden Gun was published posthumously, eight months after its author's death. Release and reception The Man with the Golden Gun was published in the UK on 1 April 1965 by Jonathan Cape, was 221 pages long and cost eighteen shillings. Cover artist Richard Chopping undertook the cover design again and was paid 300 guineas for the artwork. The Man with the Golden Gun was published in the US in August 1965, was 183 pages long and cost $4.50. Even before the US edition was published, The Man with the Golden Gun was ninth place on the best-seller lists, with 80,000 pre-orders for the hardback version. =Reviews= Critics did not praise The Man with the Golden Gun, although much of the criticism was muted. Fleming biographer Henry Chandler noted that the novel \\"received polite and rather sad reviews, recognizing that the book had effectively been left half-finished, and as such did not represent Fleming at the top of his game.\\" Kingsley Amis wrote in the New Statesman that the book was \\"a sadly empty tale, empty of the interests and effects that for better or worse, Ian Fleming made his own.\\" Meanwhile, the critic for The Times wrote that the novel would \\"doubtless be followed with close attention by the keen-eyed admirers of the many-wiled Bond.\\" Maurice Richardson, writing in The Observer, lamented that \\"perhaps Ian Fleming was very tired when he wrote it. Perhaps ... he left it unrevised. The fact remains that this posthumous Bond is a sadly sub-standard job.\\" His praise for the novel was muted, admitting \\"it isn't of course by any means totally unreadable but it's depressingly far from the best Bond.\\" Writing in The Observers sister paper, The Guardian, Christopher Wordsworth noted that \\"since Goldfinger 007 has been toiling hopelessly in the wake of the Zeitgeist.\\" Prior to this novel, Wordsworth writes, \\"the distance between Live and let Die, Ian Fleming's second and best, and You Only Live Twice, his last and worst, is a long iron down the Sandwich fairway.\\" The Man with the Golden Gun, however, sinks to the level of a \\"farrago\\". William Trevor, writing in The Listener, was dismissive of the work, thinking that \\"Bond continues to behave with so little originality that neither Templar nor Drummond, Marlowe nor Nick Charles, would have paused to waste a pellet on him\\"; he continued, saying that \\"this present work is once again a fantasy for grown-up children, neither as clever nor exciting as the early thrillers of Edgar Wallace or the boys adventure stories of fifty years ago.\\" Trevor did admit that \\"for those who like to escape to Bondsville, the old boom-town hasn't changed a scrap.\\" The critic for Time was damning, saying that \\"It may have been just as well that Fleming died when everybody still thought he could do no wrong\\". Meanwhile, the critic for Newsweek said that \\"James Bond should have had a better exit. Sadly [it] ... ends not with a bang but a whimper. The world will be a vastly more lacklustre and complicated place with 007 gone.\\" The Associated Press wrote that \\"Bond and Fleming were fun. They entertained, sometimes mildly, often grandly ‚Äì but always consistently. Life will be less interesting without them.\\" In his review for The New York Times, Charles Poore wrote that The Man with the Golden Gun was \\"a gory, glittering saga\\". Poore noted that \\"The Gee-whizzery ... starts early and never flags\\" and that, despite the passing of Fleming, \\"the James Bond spirit soars on\\". The critic for Books and Bookmen lamented the fact that \\"Bond has gone out like a lamb; even the girls are below par, while the villain seems like a refuge from a seedy Western. But we'll miss our James\\". D.A.N. Jones, writing in The New York Review of Books, thought The Man with the Golden Gun was \\"an innocuous run-of-the-mill adventure story of 1911 vintage\\", Anthony Lejeune, writing in the National Review, thought that it \\"is undeniably slight, but, like everything Fleming wrote, intensely readable ... In a sense Fleming's job was finished. He had irrevocably transformed the genre in which he worked\\". Lejeune went on to say that \\"in highbrow novels sex and violence are treated gloomily: in Fleming's stories they are presented cheerfully with full enjoyment.\\" Adaptations ;Newspaper serialisation (1965) The Man with the Golden Gun was published in serial form in the Daily Express newspaper on a daily basis from 22 March 1965 onwards. ;Playboy serialisation (1965) This novel was also serialised over four issues of Playboy from April through July 1965. ;Comic strip (1966) The novel was adapted as a daily comic strip which was published in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated around the world. The adaptation ran from 10 January to 10 September 1966. The adaptation was written by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak. The strip was reprinted by Titan Books in The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2, published in 2011. ;The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) In 1974, Eon Productions made the ninth Bond film, loosely based on the novel. The film starred Roger Moore as Bond and Fleming's cousin, Christopher Lee, as Scaramanga. The film moved away from Jamaica to the Far East and borrowed from the martial arts genre that was popular in the 1970s. The plot also changed and used the 1973 energy crisis as a backdrop to the film, allowing the MacGuffin of the \\"Solex agitator\\" to be introduced.

The film grossed $62 million in the United States and $143 million worldwide over a $115 million budget, making it a box office bomb, but received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Plot In 1991, the US and China are on the verge of a major trade agreement, with the President due to visit China to seal the deal. The CIA learns that its asset Tom Bishop has been arrested at a People's Liberation Army prison in Suzhou and will be executed in 24 hours, unless the US government claims him and bargains for his release. Bishop's actions, unsanctioned by the CIA, risk jeopardizing the agreement.. A group of CIA executives summon Nathan Muir, a mid-level case officer and Bishop's mentor, who is on his last day before retirement. While purportedly interviewing Muir to learn his history with Bishop, the executives seek a pretext for not intervening on Bishop's imprisonment. Unknown to them, Muir was tipped off about Bishop's capture by a fellow CIA veteran in Hong Kong. Muir leaks the story to CNN through an MI6 contact in Hong Kong, believing that public pressure would force American intervention. They are stalled briefly before a phone call to the FCC from CIA Deputy Director Charles Harker results in CNN retracting the story as a hoax. Muir met Bishop in 1975, when Bishop was a Marine Scout Sniper during the Vietnam War. In 1976, Muir recruited Bishop as a CIA asset in Berlin, where Bishop was tasked with procuring assets in East Germany. Then he discusses Bishop's spy work in Beirut in 1985, during the War of the Camps, which was their last mission together. We see events unfold in detail via flashback scenes. Bishop is troubled by Muir's conviction that civilian \\"assets\\" who endangered a mission should be sacrificed to preserve the \\"greater good.\\" After Bishop attempts to countermand Muir during a mission to save the life of an asset, Muir makes clear that he will not tolerate dissent, and would not rescue Bishop if he was captured going \\"off the reservation\\". During a mission in Lebanon, Bishop, posing as a photojournalist, meets relief worker Elizabeth Hadley. While using her to connect with an asset for the mission, they became romantically involved. Muir distrusts Hadley, and reveals to Bishop that she was exiled from the UK. Hadley later confesses to Bishop that she was involved in the bombing of a Chinese building in Britain, which was supposed to be empty but contained Chinese nationals. Bishop reveals to Hadley his true identity. Muir elects again to sacrifice a civilian asset for the sake of their mission, and Bishop cuts professional ties with Muir. Muir, fearing that Hadley could be a threat to the Agency and potentially Bishop, makes a deal with the Chinese, exchanging Hadley in return for an arrested US diplomat. Chinese agents kidnap Hadley, and a Dear John letter is forged and left for Bishop. In the present, Muir recognizes that Bishop went to China for Hadley. In a series of misdirections, he forges a directive signed by the CIA director to begin \\"Operation Dinner Out\\", a rescue mission spearheaded by a SEAL team that Bishop had developed as a \\"Plan B\\" for his own attempt at rescuing Hadley. Using $282,000 of his life savings and a misappropriated file on Chinese coastline satellite imagery, Muir enlists the help of his Hong Kong colleague in bribing a Chinese energy official to cut power to the prison for 30 minutes, during which time the SEAL rescue team will retrieve Bishop and Hadley. Harker is suspicious that Muir is working against the CIA, but when he confronts Muir before the gathered executives, Muir \\"confesses\\" to unprofessionally using company resources to gather information about his intended retirement home, which he has distorted the evidence to support. Bishop is rescued along with Hadley, and infers that Muir was responsible when he hears the pilot refer to Operation Dinner Out, which was also the code name for an operation Bishop used to get a birthday gift for Muir while they were in Lebanon. When the CIA officials are belatedly informed of the rescue, Muir has already left the building and is seen driving safely off into the countryside. Cast * Robert Redford as Nathan D.

Its applications include rainfall and runoff, the routes that surface water takes (for example through rivers or reservoirs), and the occurrence of floods and droughts. Surface-water hydrology is used to predict the effects of water constructions such as dams and canals. It considers the layout of the watershed, geology, soils, vegetation, nutrients, energy and wildlife. Modelled aspects include precipitation, the interception of rain water by vegetation or artificial structures, evaporation, the runoff function and the soil-surface system itself. When surface water seeps into the ground above bedrock, it is categorized as groundwater, and the rate at which this occurs determines baseflow needs for instream flow, as well as subsurface water levels in wells. While groundwater is not part of surface-water hydrology, it must be taken into account for a full understanding of the behaviour of surface water. Glacial hydrology is a part of surface-water hydrology; some of the runoff from glaciers and snow also involves groundwater hydrology concepts.

It is a towered airport operated under the Columbus Regional Airport Authority. It is one of 12 general aviation reliever airports in Ohio recognized in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) and is a reliever airport for John Glenn Columbus International Airport. Most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, but Bolton Field is TZR to the FAA and has no IATA code.Great Circle Mapper: KTZR - Columbus, Ohio (Bolton Field) History Bolton Field opened on October 24, 1970, a day after Franklin County Common Pleas Court rejected a move by a nearby private airport (located on Darby Dan Farm) to stop it. Major Harry Charles Davidson, a WWII veteran residing in Groveport, Ohio, was the first airport manager at Bolton Field. Major Harry Charles Davidson was appointed by Mayor of Columbus, Jack Sensenbrenner. The airport is named after long-time Port Columbus International Airport Superintendent Francis A. ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Bolton, honored posthumously when the city dedicated the airfield to him at its opening. The airport was built to handle personal and business aviation, freeing Port Columbus for commercial traffic. In 1980 the operation of John Glenn International Airport (formerly Port Columbus International Airport) and Bolton Field Airport was transferred from the City of Columbus to the Columbus Airport Authority; in 2003 the Columbus Airport Authority and the Rickenbacker Port Authority merged to create the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, which manages John Glenn Columbus International (CMH), Rickenbacker International Airport (LCK) and Bolton Field (TZR) airports.  Facilities and aircraft =Facilities= Bolton Field covers and has one asphalt runway (4/22) . Fuel is available; planes can use tiedowns or hangars for parking. Capital City Jet provides flight instruction, Fixed Based Operations, as well as air charter services. Columbus State Community College has an Aviation Maintenance Training Program. Scioto Valley 99s and Central Ohio Balloon Club are aviation organizations located on the grounds. =Aircraft= In the year ending June 21, 2011 the airport had 74,511 aircraft operations, average 204 per day: 57% local general aviation, 43% transient general aviation <1% air taxi and <1% military. 82 aircraft are based at this airport: 90% single engine, 6% multi- engine, 2% jet aircraft and 1% helicopters.  Incidents and accidents  * On June 18, 1993, upon approach for landing on Grass Runway 22, a Glasfl√ºgel H-101 glider registered N101AZ, encountered a powered airplane, which had entered the landing pattern. The pilot extended his base leg to the approach to accommodate the aircraft. He then decided that it would be difficult to complete the landing on the planned runway, so he switched to a site he was unfamiliar with. During this landing, the glider impacted a ditch. The ultra- light aircraft suffered damage to its tail section.

Home zone in Higham on the Hill, Nuneaton, UK History Young boys playing in a New York City street, 1909 =Background= Legislation was introduced by the Highway Act 1835 which banned the playing of football and street games on the highway with a maximum penalty of up to forty shillings (¬£ as of 2015).Parliament (1835) para 72 In 1860 Taverner John Miller, MP for Colchester reported to the House of Commons that in the previous year 44 children had been sent to prison in London and Middlesex for failure to pay fines for playing in the street, highlighting the case of a 12-year-old boy sent to prison for 5 days for playing rounders. In 1925 Nancy Astor MP noted in the Commons that \\"There is no more pitiable sight in life than a child which has been arrested for playing in the street\\"., By 1935 over 2,000 young people under the age of seventeen are prosecuted for playing in the streets. In 1934 Leslie Hore- Belisha became Transport Minister and initiated a number of road safety schemes in response the rising number of Road Casualties in Great Britain; these included the zebra crossing and a proposal to introduce play streets to the UK, which had been successfully operating in the USA. Following a trial of 200 Play Streets in Manchester and Salford from 1936, the Street Playground Act 1938 allowed councils to designate streets as playgrounds where games could be played. In 1957 the Transport Minister was asked in the Commons if he was aware that playground streets regulations were being ignored and were frequently used by through traffic; the Minister responded saying that the size of Playground Streets signs had recently been increased in size to make them more prominent. Play street legislation was included in section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1960. By 1963 there were 750 such streets around the country, but there was also growing conflict between the needs of children and the needs of motorists. In that year Ernest Marples, the Transport minister, was asked in the Commons if he could make a statement about the issue of car parking in play streets; he responded by indicating that he had only occasionally received complaints about parking issues in play streets. In the same year a petition was presented in the Commons from residents objecting to the illegal use of their playground street in Westminster being used by through-traffic and by people parking cars By contrast, the minister was also questioned in the Commons about a recently approved Playgrounds Street Order for a number of streets in Newcastle which was reported to have been opposed by all residents. In 1976 Trevor Huddleston, the Bishop of Stepney commented that Britain appeared to prefer motor cars to children ‚Äòby cluttering up Play Streets with parked cars'. By the 1980s Playgrounds Streets had been largely forgotten; there were streets which retained the signage and accompanying traffic restrictions, however residents' parked cars left no space for play. =Current legislation= The main enabling legislation for home zones is given in section 268 of the Transport Act 2000 which allows the creation of 'use orders' which are orders that 'permit the use of a road for purposes other than passage'. In 2002 Farley Bank, a cul-de-sac in Hastings was designated as a Play Street giving children traffic-free space for play between 8am and sunset. Further guidelines relating to England in circular 02/2006: 'The Quiet Lanes and Home Zones (England) Regulations 2006'. Principles These principles are similar to those of the shared space type schemes, which apply also to a wider range of environments and follow closely the pattern of the Dutch woonerf schemes. Encouraging children's play is an important aim of many home zone schemes. Home zones have a very good safety record, but are not primarily designed as road safety schemes. Home zones are encouraged by the UK Government as part of new residential areas. Although it is not possible for prospective residents to be involved in the design of new streets, steps can be taken to involve them in their maintenance and management. Residents must be need to be consulted by the local Traffic Authority on the precise uses that can take place on the street (specified through a 'Use Order') and the appropriate speed of traffic on the street (specified through a 'Speed Order') before the home zone can be legally designated and signed. Home zones often involved the use of shared space, where the street is not strongly divided into exclusive pedestrian and traffic areas. Concerns have been expressed over the inability of blind and partially sighted people to use shared space streets. Providing a clear route for pedestrians that is kept free of traffic, by using street furniture for example, is one way of meeting the needs of the visually impaired. Well- designed home zones often include features such as benches, tables and play equipment to encourage social interaction. Street trees and areas of planting, ideally maintained by residents, will often feature. On-street parking also forms part of the layout in most schemes. Traffic speeds are kept low - with a typical target speed being around 20 km/h (10-15 mph) - through the overall design of the street and features such as sharp changes of direction for traffic and narrowings where only one motor vehicle can pass at a time. Traditional traffic calming features such as road humps can also be used, but should be integrated into the design rather than being added as an engineered afterthought. Examples of UK practice include Staiths South Bank in Gateshead, which at over 600 homes was the largest newbuild home zone development in the UK at the time it received planning consent. Most contemporary UK schemes have involved public realm works to existing streets in older Victorian housing areas, often to meet regeneration or traffic calming objectives.

A typical Canarian fishing village, it is home to many locals rather than being a tourist resort. It is part of the municipality of Mog√°n and is located southwest of Las Palmas. There are several bars and restaurants, the latter specialising in fresh fish caught the same day. Tuesday is market day (the largest on the island). Arguinegu√≠n features a beach and a port. Tourism is not as popular in Arguinegu√≠n as in the larger places as Maspalomas and Playa del Ingles. Holiday hotels, however, can be found in Arguinegu√≠n; Marino I, Dorado Beach, Club Puerto Atlantico, Sunwing Resort Arguinegu√≠n, Green Beach Hotel and Radisson Blu Resort to mention the larger ones. The Norwegians have especially taken the fishing village into their hearts, and the Norwegian population is quite large in the winter time. This might also be due to the Norwegian school, Norwegian church and a Norwegian health center being located in or just outside Arguinegu√≠n. There is also a Norwegian doctor's office - located at the marketplace in Arguinegu√≠n - and a big Norwegian-owned timeshare holiday resort named Anfi del Mar, located just outside Arguinegu√≠n. Transportation The harbour here hosts a ferry service to Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria and Puerto de Mog√°n whilst another popular way to reach the town from Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria is by trekking over the mountain between the two towns. The town also lies on several public bus routes offering convenient service to other towns on the island. Arguinegu√≠n is also served by an expressway (GC1) with a nearby interchange and a highway.

He co-invented Ethernet, co-founded 3Com and formulated Metcalfe's law, which describes the effect of a telecommunications network. Since January 2011, he has been Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at The University of Texas at Austin. He is also the Murchison Fellow of Free Enterprise. Metcalfe has received various awards, including the IEEE Medal of Honor and National Medal of Technology and Innovation for his work developing Ethernet technology. In addition to his accomplishments, Metcalfe has made several predictions which failed to come to pass, separately forecasting the demise of the Internet, wireless networks, and open-source software during the 1990s.  Early life  Robert Metcalfe was born in 1946 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was a gyroscope test technician, who specialized in gyroscopes. His mother was a homemaker but later became the secretary at Bay Shore High School. In 1964, Metcalfe graduated from Bay Shore High School to join the MIT Class of 1968. He finally graduated from MIT in 1969 with two S.B. degrees, one in electrical engineering and the other in industrial management from the MIT Sloan School of Management. He then went to Harvard for graduate school, earning his M.S. in applied mathematics in 1970 and his PhD in computer science (applied mathematics) in 1973.  Career  While pursuing a doctorate in computer science, Metcalfe took a job with MIT's Project MAC after Harvard refused to let him be responsible for connecting the school to the brand-new ARPAnet. At MAC, Metcalfe was responsible for building some of the hardware that would link MIT's minicomputers with the ARPAnet. ARPAnet was initially the topic of his doctoral dissertation, but the first version was not accepted.\\"Entrepreneurial Capitalism & Innovation: A History of Computer Communications from the Development of the Modem to the Early Years of the Internet, by James Pelkey, interview conducted by the author in 1988\\" \\"Only one small hitch, which is, when I showed up in June of '72 to defend my PhD thesis at Harvard, it was rejected, and I was thrown out on my ass.\\" His inspiration for a new dissertation came while working at Xerox PARC, where he read a paper about the ALOHA network at the University of Hawaii. He identified and fixed some of the bugs in the AlohaNet model and made his analysis part of a revised thesis, which finally earned him his Harvard PhD in 1973. Metcalfe was working at PARC in 1973 when he and David Boggs invented Ethernet, initially a standard for connecting computers over short distances. Metcalfe identifies the day Ethernet was born as May 22, 1973, the day he circulated a memo titled \\"Alto Ethernet\\" which contained a rough schematic of how it would work. \\"That is the first time Ethernet appears as a word, as does the idea of using coax as ether, where the participating stations, like in AlohaNet or ARPAnet, would inject their packets of data, they'd travel around at megabits per second, there would be collisions, and retransmissions, and back-off,\\" Metcalfe explained. Boggs identifies another date as the birth of Ethernet: November 11, 1973, the first day the system actually functioned. In 1979, Metcalfe departed PARC and co-founded 3Com, a manufacturer of computer networking equipment, in his Palo Alto apartment. In 1980 he received the ACM Grace Hopper Award for his contributions to the development of local networks, specifically Ethernet. In 1990, in a boardroom skirmish, the 3Com board of directors chose Eric Benhamou to succeed Bill Krause as CEO of the networking company instead of Metcalfe. Metcalfe left 3Com and began a 10-year stint as a publisher and pundit, writing an Internet column for InfoWorld. He became a venture capitalist in 2001 and is now a general partner at Polaris Venture Partners. In 1997, he co-founded Pop!Tech, an executive technology conference. In November 2010 Metcalfe was selected to lead innovation initiatives at The University of Texas at Austin's Cockrell School of Engineering. He began his appointment in January 2011. Metcalfe was a keynote speaker at the 2016 Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders and in 2019 he presented the Bernard Price Memorial Lecture in South Africa.https://www.saiee.org.za/EventOrganisers/EventDetailsCorp.aspx?eeid=29284  Awards  In 1996, Metcalfe was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor for \\"exemplary and sustained leadership in the development, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet.\\" In 2003 he received the Marconi Award for \\"For inventing the Ethernet and promulgating his Law of network utility based on the square of the nodes\\" On March 14, 2003, Metcalfe received the National Medal of Technology from President Bush in a White House ceremony \\"for leadership in the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet\\". In May 2007, along with 17 others, Metcalfe, was inducted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, for his work with Ethernet technology. (currently inaccessible) In October 2008, Metcalfe received the Fellow Award from the Computer History Museum \\"for fundamental contributions to the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet.\\"  Incorrect predictions  Metcalfe predicted in 1995 that the Internet would suffer a \\"catastrophic collapse\\" the following year; he promised to eat his words if it did not. During his keynote speech at the sixth International World Wide Web Conference in 1997, he took a printed copy of his column that predicted the collapse, put it in a blender with some liquid and then consumed the pulpy mass. He had tried to eat his words printed on a very large cake, but the audience would not accept this form of \\"eating his words.\\" During an event where he talked about predictions at the eighth International World Wide Web Conference in 1999, a participant asked: what is the bet?. He stated that there was no bet as he was not ready to eat another column. Metcalfe has harshly criticized open source software, and Linux in particular, predicting that the latter would be obliterated after Microsoft released Windows 2000: ::The Open Source Movement's ideology is utopian balderdash [... that] reminds me of communism. [...] Linux [is like] organic software grown in utopia by spiritualists [...] When they bring organic fruit to market, you pay extra for small apples with open sores ‚Äì the Open Sores Movement. When [Windows 2000] gets here, goodbye Linux. He later recanted to some extent, saying in a column two weeks later: ::I am ashamed of myself for not resisting the temptation to take cheap shots in my column ... I should not have fanned the flames by joking about the Open Source initiative. He predicted that wireless networking would die out in the mid 1990s.: ::After the wireless mobile bubble bursts this year, we will get back to stringing fibers ... bathrooms are still predominantly plumbed. For more or less the same reason, computers will stay wired. He predicted in 2006 that Windows and Linux would not be able to handle video: ::Bob Metcalfe recently gave a TV interview in which he stated that current operating systems (Windows and Linux) are outdated clunkers that won't be able to adequately handle the coming of \\"video internet\\" and suggests that new operating systems need to be developed to take hold in a few years.

Biography Arthur Whitten Brown was born in Glasgow to American parents; his father had been sent to Scotland to evaluate the feasibility of siting a Westinghouse factory in Clydeside. The factory was eventually sited in Trafford Park in Stretford, Lancashire, and the family subsequently relocated there. Brown began his career in engineering before the outbreak of World War I and undertook an apprenticeship with British Westinghouse in Manchester. In 1914, he enlisted in the ranks of the University and Public Schools Brigade (UPS) for which he had to take out British citizenship. The ranks of the UPS were full of potential officers and Brown was one of those who sought a commission to become a Second Lieutenant in the 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion of the Manchester Regiment. After service in France, Brown was seconded to 2 Squadron Royal Flying Corps as an observer. Brown's aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire over Vendin-le-Vieil in France while on artillery observation duties. He was sent back to England to recuperate but returned only to be shot down again, this time with a punctured fuel tank, near Bapaume in B.E.2c (number 2673) on a reconnaissance flight on 10 November 1915. Brown and his pilot, 2nd Lt. H. W. Medlicott, were captured by the Germans. (In June 1918 Medlicott was shot by the Germans while attempting to escape for the fourteenth time). Later interned in Switzerland, Brown was repatriated in September 1917. After a period of leave he went to work with Major Kennedy RAF in the Ministry of Munitions. This led Brown to meet Kennedy's daughters, one of whom he later married. After the war Brown sought various appointments that would give him the security to allow him to marry. One of the firms he approached was Vickers, a consequence of which was that he was asked if he would be the navigator for the proposed transatlantic flight, partnering John Alcock, who had already been chosen as pilot. Transatlantic flight John Alcock in 1919 The flight from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Clifden, Connemara, Ireland, took place on 14 June 1919. They departed St John's at 1.45 pm local time, and landed in Derrygimla bog 16 hours and 12 minutes later after flying 1,980 miles (3,168 km). The flight was made in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber, and won a ¬£10,000 prize offered by London's Daily Mail newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. A few days after the flight both Brown and Alcock were honoured with a reception at Windsor Castle during which King George V invested them with their insignia as Knights Commanders of the Order of the British Empire. Post flight career Later he worked for Metropolitan-Vickers (MetroVick), the company that had once been British Westinghouse. In 1923 he was appointed chief representative for Metropolitan-Vickers in the Swansea area. During World War II Brown served in the Home Guard as a Lieutenant-Colonel before resigning his commission in July 1941, rejoining the RAF and working in RAF Training Command as a pilot officer dealing with navigation. His health deteriorated and by mid-1943 he had to resign from the RAFVR and give up his Air Training Corps commitments on medical advice. Brown's only son, Arthur (known as Buster), was killed on the night of 5/6 June 1944, aged 22, while serving with the RAF as a Flight Lieutenant. His aircraft, a de Havilland Mosquito VI NT122, of 605 Squadron, crashed in the Netherlands. Buster was buried at the general cemetery in Hoorn, the town closest to the crash. The death of his only son affected Brown badly. By 1948 Brown's health had again deteriorated, although he was allowed to undertake restricted duties as general manager for Metropolitan-Vickers at the Wind Street offices. Brown died in his sleep on 4 October 1948 from an accidental overdose of Veronal, a sleeping pill, aged 62. Probate was granted on 16 December 1948 to his widow, listed as Marguerite Kathleen Whitten Brown, for effects totalling ¬£5,002 0s 3d. Brown's widow died on 1 May 1952, aged 56, at Brunswick Nursing Home, Fyfnone, Swansea. Probate was dated 9 June 1952 and left effects of ¬£4,342 6s 11d to an Eileen Howard Kennedy, spinster. Brown and his wife's ashes are interred at St Margaret Churchyard, Tylers Green, Buckinghamshire, England.

In 1908, he co-founded the construction company Kreuger & Toll Byggnads AB, which specialized in new building techniques. By aggressive investments and innovative financial instruments, he built a global match and financial empire. Between the two world wars, he negotiated match monopolies with European, Central American and South American governments, and finally controlled between two thirds and three quarters of worldwide match production, becoming known as the \\"Match King\\".Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p.9) Kreuger's financial empire has been described by one biographer as a Ponzi scheme, based on the supposedly fantastic profitability of his match monopolies.see in: The Incredible Ivar Kreuger by Allen Churchill (Weidenfeld, London; Rinehart & Co., New York; 1957) However, in a Ponzi scheme early investors are paid dividends from their own money or that of subsequent investors. Although Kreuger did this to some extent, he also controlled many legitimate and often very profitable businesses, and owned banks, real estate, a gold mine, and pulp and industrial companies, besides his many match companies. Many of them have survived to this day. Kreuger & Toll, for example, was composed of bona fide businesses, and there were others like it.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.13;51 Another biographer called Kreuger a \\"genius and swindler\\",Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A.

The Price Waterhouse autopsy of his financial empire stated: \\"The manipulations were so childish that anyone with but a rudimentary knowledge of bookkeeping could see the books were falsified.\\"Charles R. Morris, A Rabble of Dead Money: The Great Crash and the Global Depression: 1929-1939 (2017), p 167. In March 1932, he was found dead in the bedroom of his flat in Paris. The police concluded that he had committed suicide, but decades later, his brother Torsten claimed that he had been murdered, which spawned some controversial literature on the subject.  Early life  Kreuger as a graduate at the age of 16. Kreuger was born in Kalmar, the eldest son of Ernst August Kreuger (1852‚Äì1946), an industrialist in the match industry in that city,who was also Russian vice consul, a position he had inherited from his own father, Per Edward Kreuger. and his wife Jenny Emelie Kreuger (n√©e Forssman; 1856‚Äì1949). Ivar Kreuger had five siblings: Ingrid (born 1877), Helga (born 1878), Torsten (born 1884), Greta (born 1889) and Britta (born 1891). At school, Ivar skipped ahead two classes by taking private lessons. At age 16, he began studies at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, from which he graduated with combined master's degrees covering both the faculties of mechanical and civil engineering, at the age of 20.Remark: The M. Sc. degree around 1900 cannot be compared to the present demands. Today, two MSc. covering the full education program in both faculties in four years is impossible.

Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Magnusson and Ivar Kreuger (to the right) onboard M/Y Loris in Stockholm 1924. Ivar Kreuger never married, but lived for many years in different periods with Ingeborg Eberth (1889‚Äì1977),Ingeborg Eberth's parents were Otto Alfred H√§ssler (d. 1929), publisher married to Jenny Charlotta H√§ssler (d. 1937). family name H√§ssler, born in Stockholm, who worked as a physical therapist in Stockholm. They met for the first time in Stockholm in 1913. According to the book she wrote in 1932, after Krueger's death, he was not interested in marriage or children, and was very much focused on his business. She broke off the relationship in 1917 and moved to Denmark, where she married a Danish engineer with the name Eberth. They had a daughter in 1919, Grete Eberth (later to be an actress in Stockholm, married name Mac Laury 1919‚Äì2002). After some years, however, she divorced Eberth and moved back to Stockholm with her daughter, reuniting with Kreuger. Mr. Eberth once kidnapped the daughter in Stockholm and brought her back to Denmark. Shortly thereafter Ingeborg, without notifying the authorities or police, went down to Denmark and brought the daughter back to Sweden by hiring a private fishing boat in Denmark that took them over √ñresund to Sweden. The new period with Kreuger lasted until around 1928; after that they just met occasionally. The last time they met was in November 1931, just before Kreuger started on his final trip to America. Eberth received the news about his death in Paris on March 12, 1932, from newspaper headlines the day after. Kreuger had private apartments in Stockholm, New York, Paris, and Warsaw, and a country place used during the summer season on the private island √ÑngsholmenPosition WGS84: in the archipelago of Stockholm. On business tours in Europe, he preferred to meet his business associates in Paris and then stayed in his flat at 5, Av. Victor Emanuel III (today named Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt). He owned several specially designed motor yachts, among them Elsa built in 1906, Loris (1913), T√§rnan (1925), and the most famous, Svalan (Swallow),Drawing sketch Swallow built at Liding√∂ in 1928, a 37 ft, 4.9 ton motor yacht, equipped with a V12, 31.9 liter Hispano-Suiza engine from the US company Wright, with 650 HP output, capable of more than 50 knots. A replica of the boat has been built.Pampas Shipyard and Yacht Club, Stockholm He had a large private library in both his apartments in Stockholm and New York and quite a large art collection. The paintings were sold at different auctions held in September 1932, as all of Kreuger's private assets were incorporated into the bankruptcy. The collection in Stockholm comprised 88 original paintings, among them 19 by Anders Zorn and a great number by old masters from the Netherlands. The New York collection included original paintings by Rembrandt and Anthony van Dyck. Kreuger became the major shareholder when the Swedish film company AB Svensk Filmindustri (SF) was founded in 1919 and because of that, sometimes met celebrities from the film industry. In June 1924, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were invited by SF to Stockholm and were guided around the Stockholm archipelago in Kreuger's motor yacht Loris. A five-minute film sequence of this occasion is stored in SF's film archive.Filmsequence with Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks i Stockholm 1924. SVT-Play. Pickford, Fairbanks, Kreuger, Charles Magnusson (the manager for SF), Greta Garbo and various SF employees appear in the film.  Early years in the United States  After the start of the 20th century, Kreuger spent seven years traveling and working abroad as an engineer in the USA, Mexico, South Africa and other countries, but spent most of the time in the US. In South Africa, he ran a restaurant for a short time together with his friend Anders Jordahl, but they soon sold the restaurant. At an early stage, he came in contact with the patented Kahn System for concrete-steel constructions that was exploited by Julius Kahn's Trussed Concrete Steel Company, when working for different engineering companies, among them The Consolidated Engineering & Construction Co. and Purdy & Henderson in New York. This new technique had not been introduced in Sweden at that time. In 1907, he managed to get the representative rights for the system for both the Swedish and the German markets, and at the end of 1907, he returned to Sweden with the goal of introducing the new methods in both countries at the same time. At that time, one of the experts in Sweden in concrete-steel constructions was his cousin Henrik Kre√ºger working at KTH in Stockholm.  Historical cost and prices  Note that multiplying historical U.S. prices of the period by 15 will result in an approximate value in today's prices.File:US Historical Inflation.svg - Wikimedia Commons To appreciate the enormous sums with which he was involved and to evaluate Ivar Kreuger, it is necessary to factor out inflation.

In May 1908, Kreuger formed the construction firm Kreuger & Toll in Sweden with the engineer Paul Toll, at that time working for the construction company Kasper H√∂glund AB, and his cousin Henrik Kre√ºger, working at the faculty of civil engineering at KTH, as a consulting engineer for the company. In Germany, he formed the company Deutsche KahneisengesellschaftIn English, German Kahn-steel Company. together with a colleague from his time in America, Anders Jordahl.Jordahl Befeistungstechnik website, Jordahl history (in German). The new way of constructing buildings was not fully accepted in Sweden at that time and in order to market the new technique, Kreuger held several lectures and wrote an illustrated article on the subject in a leading engineering magazine, Teknisk Tidskrift.Title (translated): \\"Experiences in concrete steel constructions in North America\\" by Ivar Kreuger in the magazine Teknisk Tidskrift, 1908. This new technology of constructing buildings was a success and the firm won several prestigious contracts, such as the construction of the Stockholm Olympic Stadium (1911‚Äì12); the foundation work for the new Stockholm City Hall (1912‚Äì13) and the department store NK (1913‚Äì14) in Stockholm. The chief engineer behind these advanced projects was Henrik Kre√ºger. Innovation in the construction business also included a definite commitment to finish the building on time. Hitherto the financial risk of delays were assumed by the clients. Kreuger & Toll was the first firm in Europe to commit to finish projects by a fixed date, thus shifting the risk to the builder, who after all was in the best position to reduce delays. When Kreuger won the contract to build a six-story \\"skyscraper\\", he promised that if construction wasn't finished by a particular date Kreuger & Toll would give the client a partial refund of $1,200 (about $18,000 in today's currency )for each late day. It is noteworthy that Kreuger & Toll's entire capital would have covered just two days of being late. The client, in turn, agreed to pay a bonus for every day the building was finished before the due date. Kreuger & Toll finished early and subsequently earned completion bonuses for every project. Within a few years, Kreuger & Toll was seen as the best building company in Sweden and one of the top firms in all of Europe.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.33 Within six years after its incorporation, Kreuger & Toll earned annual profits of around $200,000 and was paying a substantial dividend of 15%.Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960)p.44 In 1917, the company was split into two separate companies: Kreuger & Toll Construction AB, with the majority of shares owned by Paul Toll. Ivar Kreuger was not among the board members in the construction company. How much of Paul Toll's company Ivar Kreuger owned has not been revealed‚Äîjust that Paul Toll owned 60% in 1917 and, around 1930, 66% of the construction company. Kreuger & Toll Construction Co. has never shown up in any Kreuger & Toll Holding organisation charts. Kreuger & Toll Holding became his financial holding company, with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager and major share holder. He controlled it with a tight grip. The board of directors consisted of Ivar, his father, Paul Toll and two very close colleagues.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.8‚Äì9 After Ivar got involved in his father's match factories in Kalmar, he became more focused on \\"constructing\\" new companies or taking control of other corporations - usually paying with his own securities instead of cash - rather than buildings and bridges. Thus, by 1927, Ivar had bought banks, mining companies, railways, timber and paper firms, film distributors, real estate in several European cities as well as a controlling stake in L.M. Ericsson & Co., Sweden's leading phone company. He controlled about 50% of the world market in iron ore and cellulose. He owned mines all over the world including the Boliden mine in Sweden, which had one of the richest gold deposits outside South Africa in addition to other minerals.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.112 - 113 Kreuger formed Swedish Match by merging his father's business with other match factories he had quietly bought during World War I. Its initial capital was around $10 million ( in today's currency ) and Ivar owned about half of it, held all senior positions and controlled the board of directors.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.8 The Swedish banker Oscar Rydbeck (1878‚Äì1951) became a close associate and an important teacher for Ivar in the financing business. He worked for Kreuger & Toll as a consultant from around 1912 until the Kreuger Crash in 1932 and was a member of its board of directors. For not having carried out his duties as a director he went to jail for 10 months after Ivar's death.Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960)p.237  The match business  Ivar Kreuger in the headquarters of Swedish Match, the Matchstick Palace, in Stockholm around 1930. Oscar Rydbeck, Ivar Kreuger's banker. Photo: around 1930. In 1911 and 1912, the Kreuger family match factories in Kalmar, Fredriksdal and M√∂nster√•s, run by his father Ernst Kreuger, uncle Fredrik Kreuger and his brother Torsten Kreuger, encountered financial problems. Kreuger was then advised by his banker Oscar Rydbeck to turn the factories into a stock corporation in order to raise more capital. This was the starting point for the reformation of the Swedish match industry as well as the major match companies in Norway and Finland. The goal was to get control of the entire match industry in Scandinavia. With the family match factories as the base, Kreuger first founded the Swedish corporation AB Kalmar-M√∂nster√•s T√§ndsticksfabrik in 1912. His father, Ernst, and uncle Fredrik, became the major shareholders and his brother Torsten was appointed the general manager. Ivar became a member of the board. A merger between this company with several other small match companies in Sweden, the company AB Svenska F√∂renade T√§ndsticksfabrikerIn English, \\"Swedish United Match Companies\\". was founded in 1913 with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager. Later, by merging with the largest match company in Sweden, AB J√∂nk√∂ping-Vulcan, Svenska T√§ndsticks AB (Swedish Match) was founded in 1917. Ivar had originally tried to convince AB J√∂nk√∂ping-Vulcan to merge in December 1912, but they had not been interested as Vulcan was the dominating match company in Sweden. Ivar then started to acquire all of the match companies as well as most of the raw material companies he could find in and around Sweden and then finally got AB J√∂nk√∂ping-Vulcan to accept the merger. He had been so persuasive in arguing for the merger that he managed to overvalue his side of the deal so that it was essentially the smaller organization taking over the larger one. It was his first big venture in inflating values, which became his prime tactic thereafter.Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960) p.44 One of the main designers behind this operation, beside Ivar, was his banker Rydbeck. The total number of shares in the new company was 450,000. Ivar Kreuger personally owned 223,000 shares and his new holding company, Kreuger & Toll Holding AB, 60,000. This company group now covered the entire match industry in Sweden, including all the major companies that manufactured the production machines used in the factories. The total number of employees working in match production in Sweden in 1917 was around 9000. It also had control over major companies supplying the raw material for the match industry. During this time Kreuger also acquired the largest match manufacturing companies in Norway (Bryn and Halden) and in Finland (Wiborgs and Kekkola). However, Kreuger not only \\"acquired\\" companies but also introduced a new way of thinking in the Swedish match industry with large scale production facilities, ideas to increase efficiency in production, administration, distribution, and marketing. He managed to unite the Swedish match industry as well as the major match companies in Norway and Finland. With this new company structure the match industry in Scandinavia became a major competitor to large manufacturers elsewhere. Ivar's methods resembled those John D. Rockefeller used in the formation of the Standard Oil Trust transforming dozens of struggling factories into a strong and profitable monopoly.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.34 - 35 The methods had become illegal in the USA because of anti-trust laws, but were not against the law in Sweden at the time. A German chemist had invented phosphorus matches in 1832 but they were dangerous because the yellow phosphorus used was poisonous and because it was in the match head and thus could easily light by accident. The Swedes improved on the design by using a safer red phosphorus, which they put on the striking surface of the matchbox. They called them \\"safety matches\\". They made Sweden the leading exporter of matches and made matches the most important Swedish export.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.6 It should be remembered that in the early part of the 20th century matches were a necessity for smoking and the lighting of stoves and gas appliances among other uses and therefore demand for them was highly inelastic, meaning that a monopolist could raise prices (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold. By expanding the Swedish Match company through acquisition of government-created monopolies, the Swedish company became the world's largest match manufacturer. Kreuger set up an affiliate to Kreuger & Toll AB in the United States, and together with Lee, Higginson & Co. in New York, formed the International Match Corporation. This group eventually came to control almost 75% of the world production in matches.  Other business  From 1925 to 1930, years when many countries in Europe were suffering after the First World War, Kreuger's companies gave loans to governments to speed up reconstruction. As a security, the governments would grant him the match monopoly in their country. This means that Kreuger gained a monopoly in match production, sales, or distribution, or a complete monopoly. The monopoly agreements differed from country to country. The capital was raised to a large extent through loans from Swedish and American banks, combined with issuing a large amount of participating debentures. Kreuger also often moved money from one corporation he controlled to another. Kreuger did not limit himself to matches, but gained control of most of the forestry industry in northern Sweden and planned to become head of a cellulose cartel. He also attempted to create a telephone monopoly in Sweden. After founding the pulp manufacturer SCA, in 1929 Kreuger was able to acquire the majority shares in the telephone company Ericsson; the mining company Boliden (gold); major interests in the ball bearing manufacturer SKF; the bank Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget and others. Abroad he acquired Deutsche Unionsbank in Germany and Union de Banques √† Paris in France, often with the acquired company's own money. These maneuvers were made both necessary and possible by his invention, decades ahead of his time, of Enron- style financial engineering, which reported profits when there were none and paid out ever increasing dividends by attracting new investment and/or looting the treasury of a newly acquired company. By 1931, Kreuger controlled some 200 companies. However, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 turned out to be a major factor in exposing his accounting that ultimately proved fatal to both him and his empire. In the spring of 1930, he visited the United States and gave a lecture about the situation in world economics at the Industrial Club of Chicago with the title \\"The transfer problem and its importance to the United States\\".Speech held May 15, 1930. National Library of Sweden He was invited by President Hoover to the White House to discuss the subject and in June he was awarded the title Doctor of Business Administration by Syracuse University, where he had worked as a young chief engineer when Archbold Stadium was built there in 1907. In 1929, at the peak of his career, the Kreuger fortune was thought to be worth 30 billion Swedish kronor, equivalent to approximately US$100 billion in 2000, and consisting of more than 200 companies. In the same year, the total loans made by Swedish banks were barely 4 billion SEK.  Financial innovations and financial engineering  Obtaining a monopoly for the production and/or sale of matches in return for loans to governments was, in its essence, not a new way of doing business. Such schemes had been around for a long time (e.g. the Mississippi Bubble of John Law, and the South Sea Bubble) but Kreuger was very creative inventing new ways of financing business, while making sure that he kept control of his companies. = B-shares = Kreuger financed his activities by selling shares and bonds of his companies as well as through large bank loans, mainly the last two. The use of debt in addition to equity is called leverage and it magnifies both gains and losses.Leverage, at Investopedia With respect to selling shares, he invented dual class ownership sharesDual Control , at Investopedia since he did not want to lose control of his companies. He called the class of shares with reduced voting power B shares. One of Kreuger's biographers, Frank Partnoy, called it \\"an ingenious piece of financial engineering\\". Ivar began with Swedish Match where he divided the common shares into two classes. Each class would have the same claim to dividends and profits, but the B shares would carry only 1/1000 of a vote, compared to one vote for each A share. In this way Ivar could double the size of his capital, while diluting his control by just a fraction of a percent.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.76 Presently such shares are sometimes called A Shares with the B Shares having more voting power, as is the case with Google for instance where they carry ten times more voting power than the A Shares.Google Shares , at Stocks site As already stated, these types of shares are used to this day although, unlike in Kreuger's time, there are often restrictions in some markets and/or jurisdictions nowadays. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, allows companies to list dual-class voting shares. Once shares are listed, however, companies are not allowed to reduce the voting rights of the existing shares or issue a new class of superior voting shares.Fundamental, at Investopedia There is a wide range of dual-class share structures and their use between countries. In Canada, for example, an estimated 20% to 25% of companies currently listed on the TSX make use of some form of dual-class share structure or special voting rights. In the United States on the other hand, where rules on dual-class shares are much more restrictive and investor opposition is more vocal, just over 2% of companies issue restricted shares. = Convertible gold debentures = Ivar and Lee Higginson & Co., his investment banker in the USA, decided to have International Match issue new securities called convertible gold debentures. \\"Debenture\\" is a debt instrument not secured by physical collateral or assets.Reinhart, Carmen M., Roggof, Kenneth S. This Time Is Different, Princeton University Press, Princeton and Oxford, c.2009 , p.42 They were issued to mature in 20 years and they were payable in either dollars or gold, at the holder's option. These bonds gave investors the right to receive annual interest payments of 6.5 percent from International Match, which was an attractive rate at the time. Finally, these debentures were convertible, which meant that they could be converted into shares. If International Match performed well and the value of the shares increased, investors could switch from the debentures to the more valuable shares. The convertible feature made these securities particularly attractive: they have both downside protection (because in the case of bankruptcy the bond holders were paid before the shareholders) and upside potential. In other words, the best of both worlds. \\"Ivar and Lee Higginson had designed their first financial mousetrap.\\" Ivar's popularity helped Lee Higginson sell $15 million of International Match gold debentures, at a price of $94.50 for each $100 of principal amount. Investors paid $94.50 in return for the right to receive interest of $6.50 per year for 20 years (6.5 percent of the hundred dollars principal amount.). The deal raised a total of $14,175,000, i.e. 94.5 percent of $15 million.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.42 - 43 = American Certificates = Kreuger invented another financial instrument, which continues to be used and is nowadays known as American depositary receipts. That issue was called Kreuger & Toll \\"American Certificates\\". American investors had never seen an investment like this. It was part bond, part preferred stock, and part profit sharing option. The certificates enabled investors to gain exposure to a foreign company that had been paying dividends of 25 percent. It would be backed by the largest private loan to a foreign government (i.e. Germany) ever. Even in the midst of the growing panic investors went crazy for the issue and promised to buy 28 million dollars of the new securities.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.43 And this happened two days after Black Monday in 1929. = Binary foreign exchange option = The second Poland agreement also contained some extraordinary protection for International Match including a binary foreign exchange option, a kind of derivative contract,Derivatives, at NYTimes Topics to protect International Match from any declines in the value of the dollar: \\"International Match Corporation shall have the right to obtain payment of interest in Dutch guilders or US dollars according to its choice and for all such payments one dollar shall be counted as 2¬Ω guilders.\\" To retain control of Garanta, Ivar created another innovative financial provision, which meant that during the first four years until October 1, 1929, International Match Corporation had the right to appoint the managing director of Garanta who alone was entitled to sign for the company on or after October 1, 1929, International Match Corporation had the right to acquire 60 percent of the shares at par. This option term secured both initial control over Garanta and the right to own a majority of Garanta's shares in the future.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.81 = Off balance sheet entities = This means that details of an enterprise do not appear in the parent company's financial statements. Some of these entities were more or less secret. The associated debt, called \\"off balance sheet obligations\\", didn't appear in any financial statements of the companies Ivar controlled other than in summary form, if at all.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.x Albert D. Berning of the firm Ernst & Ernst, International Match's auditor, rationalized it at the shareholder's meeting in 1926. He said \\"it is only customary to consolidate the assets and liabilities of companies in such a balance sheet when a substantial majority of the outstanding shares are owned by the parent company. Where less than such a majority is owned, the shares are included as investments.\\"The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) pp.58,95 This invention gained rapid acceptance by others, e.g. Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers. The former issued 250 million dollars' worth of complex securities (equivalent to about 3.75 billion in today's money) in 1929. Lehman issued similar obligations, which immediately rose 30 percent.The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.133 Enron used them extensively and in the recent financial crisis they played a major role in bringing down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  Gambling  Despite the large number of bona fide companies Ivar controlled, he was an avid gambler. He speculated with his personal funds and, especially, with the money of the corporations he controlled. Kreuger treated most of his companies as if they were exclusively his personal property. He frequently transferred funds from one corporation to another with little formality. A number of dummy corporations and holding companies (e.g. Garanta and Continental Investment Corporation) helped him to hide what he was doing. He also used other people as front men to conceal his actions, for example when he acquired almost half of the outstanding shares of Diamond Match Company so as not to raise anti-trust concerns in the USA. Towards the end, in 1932, when he frantically gambled with the securities of corporations he controlled in the vain attempt to reverse their falling prices, he played the markets himself and had friends help him in the effort to prop up share prices. Between the end of February and early March 1932 he needed to make over $10 million (equivalent to more than $150 million in today's money) for payments, including Kreuger & Toll dividends. His speculations were in foreign currencies, equities and derivatives and he also signed loan agreements with governments not knowing where the funds would be coming from. For example, the majority stake he had bought in a chemical company in Griesheim, Germany returned 15 times his investment after two years when the company became part of I. G. Farben. Part of his attraction for investors were the high dividends Kreuger & Toll paid. Therefore, he also had to make sure that he had money to pay those dividends. It has never been established how much Kreuger lost in these frantic efforts in early 1932, but it has been estimated to be between $50 million and $100 million (c. $750 million and $1.5 billion in today's currency).Kreuger Genius and Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960) p.182 His first sovereign loan went to Poland and when Kreuger signed the agreement he had no idea where the funds would come from. He made a deal with Germany for a $125 million- dollar loan (almost $1.9 billion in today's currency) with the conditions that Germany sign the Young Plan and, of course, award him a match monopoly. (He already controlled 70% of German match production before the loan agreement.) When he signed the contract, he had no idea where he would obtain the huge amount; however, he was lucky. Prime Minister Aristide Briand of France decided to repay before it was due a previous $75 million-dollar loan from Ivar. Incredibly, the French agreed to pay this sum by April 1930, just before Ivar's first payment to Germany was due. That payment gave Ivar enough cash to make his first installment. Either he had negotiated a sweetheart rescue deal with Prime Minister Briand, or he was incredibly lucky. He also made $5M (c. $75 million in today's currency) due to the way the loan to France was structured. (It had been discounted and although France received only $70 million it was obligated to pay back $75 million.)The Match King by Frank Partnoy c. 2009 Frank Partnoy(Public Affairs, New York; 2009) p.156  Companies controlled by Kreuger, c. 1930  It should be kept in mind that Kreuger controlled around 400 companies, therefore the following list is highly selective.Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A.

End of the Kreuger empire and death  In March 1931, during a meeting at the German Ministry of Finance in Berlin, Swiss banker Felix Somary already warned of a bankruptcy of Kreuger's match company.Felix Somary - Erinnerungen aus meinem Leben. By mid-1931, rumours spread that Kreuger & Toll and other companies in Kreuger's empire were financially unstable. In February 1932, Kreuger turned to Sveriges Riksbank for the second time in his life to support him in raising a large increase in his loans. At this time his total loans from Swedish banks were estimated at about half of the Swedish reserve currency, which had started to have negative effects on the value of the Swedish currency in the international financial market. In order to grant him more loans, the government required that a complete statement of accounts of Kreuger's entire company group be presented, as the bank's (Sveriges Riksbank) own calculations showed that Kreuger & Toll finances were far too weak to give him more loans. At that time, Ivar Kreuger was in the United States and was asked to return to Europe for a meeting with the chairman of the Riksbank, Ivar Rooth. He had left Sweden for the last time on 23 November 1931 and returned to Europe on the ship Ile de France, arriving in Paris on 11 March 1932. The meeting with Ivar Rooth was scheduled to take place on 13 or 14 March in Berlin. He met with Krister Littorin (vice president of Kreuger & Toll holding) and his own banker Oscar Rydbeck in Paris on 11 March to prepare for the Berlin meeting. But the day after he was found dead in bed in his apartment at Avenue Victor Emanuel III. After questioning Kreuger's servants (his French maid, Mademoiselle Barrault, and the janitor who had had contact with Kreuger in the morning) the French police and a physician came to the conclusion that he had shot himself some time between 10:45 a.m. and 12:10 p.m. A 9-mm semi-automatic gun was found on the bed beside the body. He left a sealed envelope in the room, addressed to Krister Littorin, which contained three other sealed envelopes - one addressed to his sister Britta; one to Sune Sch√©le;Sune Sch√©le was working for Kreuger 1919‚Äì1932. Between 1925‚Äì1930 Sch√©le was a manager for the Kreuger business in India. and one addressed to Littorin. In the letter to Littorin (for some reason written in English although Littorin was his closest Swedish colleague), he wrote: > I have made such a mess of things that I believe this to be the most > satisfactory solution for everybody concerned. Please, take care of these > two letters also see that two letters which were sent a couple of days ago > by Jordahl to me at 5, Avenue Victor Emanuel are returned to Jordahl. The > letters were sent by Majestic - Goodbye now and thanks. I K.Police report- > Kreuger. National Archive, Stockholm.The other two letters to Sune Sch√©le > and his sister Britta have not been published. Ivar Kreuger was interred in Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.  Murder allegations  While his family believed Ivar Kreuger to have been murdered, it was only more than 30 years after Ivar Kreuger's death that many previously classified Kreuger & Toll documents and Ivar Kreuger documents were made public. Based on these and his insight in his brother's business and life, Ivar's brother Torsten Kreuger wrote a book in 1963 (2nd edition) called Kreuger & Toll, describing how Kreuger & Toll had been taken over, and how then the other Kreuger companies were taken over too. In 1965, Torsten Kreuger published Sanningen om Ivar Kreuger (published in English as: \\"Ivar Kreuger: The Truth at Last\\") claiming that his brother Ivar had been murdered. Recently, more books have been written claiming that more documents have re- appeared or were finally released to public scrutiny, and supporting Torsten Kreuger's claims that his brother was murdered: D√§rf√∂r m√∂rdades Ivar Kreuger (\\"The Reason for the Murder of Ivar Kreuger\\") () (1990), and Kreuger-Mordet: En utredning med nya fakta (translation: \\"The Kreuger Murder: An Investigation with New Facts\\") () (2000).  The Kreuger Crash  Kreuger's death precipitated the Kreuger Crash which hit investors and companies worldwide, but particularly hard in the United States and Sweden. In 1933 and 1934, the U.S. Congress passed several security reform legislations that were meant to prevent a repeat of the Kreuger Crash. These bills were largely successful in their mission and the American financial industry did not witness frauds of the same magnitude until the Enron scandal and Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. A Foreign Affairs report from 1930 had judged that of the $630m worth of assets the company claimed to have, $200m came from the match business, $30m were in the bank, and the other $400m were merely categorized as \\"other investments\\". When the company finally went bankrupt at the end of March 1932, claimed assets of $250m turned out to be non-existent. Prior to the crash, Kreuger had issued thousands of participating debentures. These were very popular, and a firm public belief in the rising Kreuger empire convinced contemporary Swedes to invest in these \\"Kreuger papers\\". Following the Kreuger crash, both the debentures and shares became worthless, and several thousand Swedes and small banks lost their savings and investments as a result. Large investors and suppliers apart from share holders, received a total of 43% back. The banks related to the Wallenberg family company group, Stenbeck company group, and Handelsbanken took over most of the companies in the Kreuger empire. Swedish Match recovered shortly after the crash as did most of the industrial companies within the Kreuger empire. Swedish Match received a large government guaranteed loan that was fully repaid after several years. IMCO in US however did not survive. The liquidation took nine years and was eventually finished in 1941.  Tentative conclusions  One biographer called him a genius and swindler. John Kenneth Galbraith wrote \\"Boiler-room operators, peddlers of stocks in the imaginary Canadian mines, mutual-fund managers whose genius and imagination are unconstrained by integrity, as well as less exotic larcenists, should read about Kreuger. He was the Leonardo of their craft.\\"Robert Shaplen's Introduction to Kreuger Genius And Swindler by John Kenneth Galbraith, (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p. x) Ivar himself admitted to some extent that not all was above board when he said, \\"I've built my enterprise on the firmest ground that can be found‚Äîthe foolishness of people.\\"Kreuger: Genius and Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p. 128) Perhaps Andrew Beattie summed it up best: \\"Ivar Kreuger is still a bit of an enigma in history. ...At times it seemed that he was a solid, if ruthless, businessman, and at other times he appeared every inch a scam artist. Between those times, he either built a match monopoly that overreached or orchestrated one of the biggest pyramid schemes in history.\\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/09/ivar- kreuger.asp Many of his financial schemes did indeed have some parallels with a Ponzi scheme in as much as he needed to raise more and more funds in order to finance the loans he extended to governments in exchange for match monopolies. It's obvious that it's impossible to have earnings in single digits (as these sovereign loans typically paid) and continue paying dividends in double digits. Dividends were as high as 20%.Called to Account: Fourteen Financial Frauds that Shaped the American Accounting Profession, Routledge, 2008 by Paul M. Clikeman, (Routledge, 2008) p. 23.

Balance sheets and Profit and Loss statements served one major purpose, if not the only one, for Ivar and that was they had to be helpful in his fund raising efforts. Often they were just pure fantasy to be revised at will to please investors. He also frequently treated the assets of corporations he controlled as if they were his own. However, things should be seen in the context of the time. IBM, for example, consolidated all its accounts in one named Plant, Property, Equipment, Machines, Patents and Goodwill. American Can doubled its reported net earnings in 1913 by claiming only $1 million of depreciation after having claimed $2.5 million the previous year. Many companies set up arbitrary reserves in good times to be used in bad years and few holding companies published consolidated financial statements. Accounting standards and auditors' responsibility for the accuracy of financial statements evolved over time. Corporations resisted publishing audited financial statements. US Steel defied convention when it published its first audited financial statements in 1903. Indeed, accountants in the early 1900s \\"fiercely resisted efforts to impose strict accounting standards\\". It was not until the US Securities Acts' of 1933 and 1934‚Äîboth heavily influenced by Kreuger's actions‚Äîthat generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) began to be established. Only in the 1970s and 1980s were auditors forced to accept more responsibility for the veracity of financial statements but loopholes continued to exist (and probably still do).Called to Account: Fourteen Financial Frauds that Shaped the American Accounting Profession, Routledge, 2008 by Paul M. Clikeman, (Routledge, 2008) pp. 3, 9, 13, 17, 20, 46 Dishonesty was part of Ivar's behaviour almost from the beginning of his career. In the first loan for a match monopoly, Ivar's brother Torsten negotiated with Dr. Marjam Glowacki, a senior Polish finance ministry official. After the documents were signed Ivar decided that it might be useful in the future to replicate Dr. Glowacki's signature. He ordered a rubber stamp that would produce a facsimile should he need it in the future. He did not use it; however, from then on he had rubber stamps made of official signatures of almost all his match deals.The Match King by Frank Partnoy (2009). Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs), New York; p. 74 \\"Mostly, Ivar had been skirting the edges of legal rules, to preserve his own flexibility.\\"The Match King by Frank Partnoy (2009). Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs), New York. p. 159 But the forgery of Italian bonds was outright fraud. A lithographer who had printed share certificates for Ivar made 42 Italian bills, which Ivar signed with the names of G. Boselli (an official in the Ministry of Finance) and A. Mosconi, (the Minister of Finance). It has never been explained why these forgeries were so crude. He even misspelled Boselli's name several times.The Match King by Frank Partnoy (2009). Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; pp. 161‚Äì162 Ivar kept them in his safe for almost two years. They would have been worth between c. 100 to 140 million dollars, if they had not been forged. (About 1.5 to 2.1 billion in today's money) When he was desperate for funds, Ivar tried to use them claiming that they were genuine.The Match King by Frank Partnoy (2009). Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York; pp. 74, 185, 191. Called to Account: Fourteen Financial Frauds that Shaped the American Accounting Profession, Routledge, 2008 by Paul M.

Reality was more nuanced. For one thing disclosure rules in his days were much less stringent. Many corporations refused to reveal details for fear competitors would gain an advantage. (At least that was the claim often made.) Some firms did not even publish quarterly results. Ivar, too, was very secretive and not only with investors. When he was on the verge of hiring somebody he usually asked: \\"Can he keep a secret?\\" He was also very fond of quoting his motto for success: \\"Silence, more silence, and still more silence.\\"Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York; 1960, p. 86) Also one cannot fault him for the speculative fever in the 1920s. Without the hunger for ever larger profits many of Ivar's schemes would not have been possible. Incidentally this facilitated a transfer of capital from the USA to Europe where it was, often desperately, needed. He sold shares in the US worth 250 million dollars (equivalent to c. 3.75 billion today) and transferred almost all of it to his holding company in Liechtenstein, Continental Investment Corporation. Shareholders of International Match had given him authority to do this so there was nothing wrong with it. There was also a tax advantage because of the advantageous deal he had negotiated with Liechtenstein. But Ivar did it above all to have the flexibility to manipulate balance sheets and financial statements so they would look more attractive to investors as well as helping him‚Äîto some extent‚Äîpay the high dividends of Swedish Match and Kreuger & Toll. He got the nickname \\"Saviour of Europe\\" by lending about $400 million (equivalent to c. $6 billion today) to rebuild their shattered economies after World War I. He invented new financial instruments to help him raise funds and, of course, make him money. Indeed, many consider Ivar to be the father of modern financial schemes. Oscar Rydbeck, his Swedish banker, said Ivar was the third richest man in the world. He, however, claimed \\"money as such means nothing to me\\".The Match King by Frank Partnoy (2009) Frank Partnoy (Public Affairs, New York). p. 188 Ivar was also a successful speculator for much of his life, earning money until shortly before the end. Trying to support the collapsing share prices of many of his companies (including ways which were‚Äîif not illegal‚Äîquestionable, e.g. using straw men for share transactions. In the case of his acquisition of Diamond Match shares it was clearly illegal because of anti-trust laws.) He controlled many legitimate, profitable businesses, some of which still exist to this day.

At the time of his death in 1932, assets were worth about $200 million, which was half of what Kreuger claimed in financial statements. Some of the shrinkage was due to depressed prices, but much went into paying dividends from capital over the years.Kreuger Genius And Swindler by Robert Shaplen (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.

He is the owner and promoter of the House of Hardcore promotion, for whom he also wrestles, and works as a wrestler, producer and member of the creative team for Impact Wrestling. Dreamer is best known for his tenures with Extreme Championship Wrestling in the 1990s and early 2000s and with World Wrestling Entertainment (previously the World Wrestling Federation), primarily from 2001 to 2010. During this time he held numerous championships including the ECW World Heavyweight Championship (which he held twice, being the only man to capture the title in both the original ECW and WWE's ECW brand). He has also held the ECW World Tag Team Championship and WWF/E Hardcore Championship. Dubbed the \\"heart and soul\\" of ECW, Dreamer regularly featured in prominent storylines for the promotion as well as holding a number of back office roles. Dreamer has also appeared for notable promotions such as Impact Wrestling, Ring of Honor and AAA. After departing from WWE in 2010, Dreamer joined Impact Wrestling and was a part of an ECW-inspired stable known as EV 2.0. In 2012, Dreamer started his own wrestling promotion called House of Hardcore, named in honor of ECW's former wrestling school of the same name. Since then, Dreamer has made sporadic appearances with WWE in 2012, 2015 and 2016 as well as wrestling on the independent circuit. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1989‚Äì1993)= Laughlin was trained in professional wrestling by Johnny Rodz. His first notable foray into the business came when he worked in International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW) under the name T.D. Madison. While there he and his storyline brother, G.Q., held the IWCCW Tag Team Championship three times in 1991. He changed his name to Tommy Dreamer, reportedly after taking his given first name, and adding \\"Dreamer\\" in tribute to Dusty Rhodes, in 1992 while working in the New England based Century Wrestling Alliance (CWA). While in the CWA, he became its first Heavyweight Champion by defeating \\"Mr. USA\\" Tony Atlas in a tournament final held in Wallingford, Connecticut, on November 5, 1992. He held the title for over four months before losing it to The Iron Sheik in Burlington, Vermont. On August 17, 1993 Tommy Dreamer wrestled a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping in White Plains, NY, losing to The Brooklyn Brawler.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm =NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993 - 2001)= Early appearances (1993‚Äì1994) Dreamer joined Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1993, just before its name change to Extreme Championship Wrestling. His first major gimmick in the company had him wrestling in matches in garish green suspenders and acting as something of a \\"pretty boy\\" ‚Äì at least in relation to the rest of the ECW roster. This gimmick got him soundly booed by crowds, even when he became the first person in wrestling history to kick out of the pin that follows the Superfly Splash of Jimmy \\"Superfly\\" Snuka at The Night the Line Was Crossed. Feud with The Sandman (1994‚Äì1995) After Michael Fay was arrested in Singapore and sentenced to a caning, ECW head booker Paul Heyman decided to capitalize on the publicity by holding a Singapore Cane match between Dreamer and The Sandman ‚Äì with the loser having to take 10 lashes. After losing the match Dreamer took his lashes, then asked The Sandman for another, causing the crowd to feel sympathy for him as he took the extra, and another. This was a launching point to an angle that ended up blurring the divide between faces and heels in wrestling, as well as start a new way of working the fans, especially the \\"smarks\\" ‚Äì fans with some amount of inside information. In a later match, Dreamer kayfabe accidentally blinded The Sandman, first by knocking a lit cigarette into his eye, then hitting in the other with a Singapore cane. Immediately after, Dreamer seemed to break kayfabe and started aiding The Sandman. He professed that he \\"didn't mean to do it\\" and that it was \\"an accident\\" as other wrestlers ‚Äì face and heel ‚Äì swarmed out to help. The feud continued with Sandman planning to announce his retirement at an ECW show, only to attack Dreamer and reveal he was never actually blind. The feud ended when Tommy Dreamer defeated the Sandman in a No DQ/No-Holds-Barred match. Feud with Raven (1995‚Äì1997) Though the blind Sandman angle was his first \\"major\\" feud in ECW, his later, years-long feud against Raven that started in January 1995 is arguably his most memorable. The two were portrayed as childhood friends who had been competing in different ways their entire lives. Raven's entrance into ECW had him accompanied by Beulah McGillicutty, an overweight girl from their kayfabe childhood who had a crush on Dreamer and was now a Penthouse Pet. Dreamer and Raven (and Raven's Nest) feuded for two years with Dreamer never getting a win over Raven until Raven's last match in ECW, a Loser Leaves Town match at Wrestlepalooza 1997. During the course of the feud, Beulah had left Raven and was Tommy's valet. Throughout 1996, during the feud with Raven, Dreamer was also involved in an additional feud with \\"Prime Time\\" Brian Lee, who was brought in as Raven's bodyguard. The two had several encounters that ended with Dreamer being chokeslammed through tables. During other fights, the pair brawled outdoors onto the street and into traffic. The feud culminated in a scaffold match at High Incident in October 1996, where Dreamer sent Lee off the scaffolding through several tables in the ring below. Various feuds (1997‚Äì2001) After Raven went to World Championship Wrestling, Dreamer began a feud with the World Wrestling Federation's Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler. The feud was largely symbolic, with Dreamer representing Extreme Championship Wrestling's \\"new school\\" style of wrestling as a concept and Lawler (with James E. Cornette) representing the World Wrestling Federation and United States Wrestling Association's more \\"old school\\" way of doing things. In 1998, Dreamer had a short feud with The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von), during which they \\"broke\\" Beulah's neck. In 1999, on their last night in the company, they cited this incident to get Dreamer to accept a challenge for the ECW Tag Team Championship they had won earlier in the night. He did accept, and got the title, but was paired with the unexpected partner Raven, who slid into the ring at the last second and made the pin. The team only lasted a short time before it dissolved, with Raven taking the title and choosing Mike Awesome as his new partner. He also, begrudgingly, became World Heavyweight Champion in 2000 by beating Tazz at CyberSlam, only to lose it to Justin Credible just 30 minutes later. When speaking of his title reigns on The Rise and Fall of ECW documentary produced by WWE Home Video, Dreamer is quoted as saying: Dreamer stayed with ECW until it folded in 2001, defeating C.W. Anderson in an \\"I Quit\\" match at Guilty as Charged ‚Äì the final pay-per-view ‚Äì and teaming with Danny Doring in a win over Julio Dinero and EZ Money in the final independent ECW show. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001 - 2010)= The Alliance (2001‚Äì2002) After ECW closed its doors, Dreamer spent time in various independent leagues throughout the country, such as Jersey All Pro Wrestling and Combat Zone Wrestling before he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He was introduced to WWF audiences on the July 9, 2001 episode of Raw as a member of the WCW/ECW Alliance during the Invasion angle. When the angle ended in November, Dreamer was sent to the WWF's \\"farm territory\\" Heartland Wrestling Association. Hardcore Champion and Heat mainstay (2002‚Äì2005) He was brought back to the main roster of the now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment in March and placed on the Raw \\"brand\\". There, he turned face and was given a gimmick that saw him proclaim that he was \\"Just a Regular Guy\\", for which he was featured in vignettes and backstage segments showing him in normal situations that were then augmented by \\"disgusting\\" antics such as brushing his teeth and his dogs teeth with the same brush and eating food from the floor. However, this angle was short-lived. He soon reverted to his \\"Innovator of Violence\\" gimmick in the summer and amassed fourteen reigns as Hardcore Champion. During this time, he was the final person to hold it before it became unified with the Intercontinental Championship in a match with Rob Van Dam at Madison Square Garden. After losing the Hardcore Championship, Dreamer renewed his feud with Raven, defeating him in a Loser Leaves Raw match on June 24 to send him to Raw's sister show, Heat. Dreamer (with a variety of partners) would feud in the fall with Lance Storm and William Regal as he sought revenge for his jaw being broken. Dreamer would make his Royal Rumble debut in 2003, bringing weapons with him and breaking Bill DeMott's hand during the match. As 2003 and 2004 went on, Dreamer was used less and less on WWE television, and they began allowing him to take independent bookings and work as color commentator for their developmental territories, Ohio Valley Wrestling, Deep South Wrestling and on occasion Heat. When his performers contract expired, he took a succession of \\"office jobs\\" inside World Wrestling Entertainment, including being the number two person in Talent Relations. ECW Original (2005‚Äì2007) Dreamer and a fan drinking beer at an ECW live event In 2005, Dreamer was a major part of the ECW One Night Stand \\"reunion show\\" pay-per-view held under the World Wrestling Entertainment banner, a show he wrote and produced in addition to \\"agenting\\" every match. He, along with a number of former ECW stars, took part in promotional hype for the event on episodes of Raw and, with The Sandman, he wrestled the Dudley Boyz in the main event. For the 2006 event, he was placed into an angle that had him and Terry Funk ‚Äì who had been his \\"mentor\\" in the early days of the original ECW ‚Äì at odds with then-heels, Mick Foley and Edge over the meanings of \\"extreme\\". The angle ended with a six-person-intergender-tag team match at the pay-per-view where Dreamer, Funk, and Beulah McGillicutty lost to Edge, Foley, and Lita. When the ECW brand officially launched on the Sci Fi channel, Dreamer and the Sandman were put into one of the brands first feuds, an \\"old school versus new school\\" feud, against Test and Mike Knox. In November and December he engaged in a short feud with Daivari and The Great Khali, but Khali was sent to the Raw brand before it could come to a conclusion. Not long after Khali left ECW, The New Breed stable was established, consisting of wrestlers new to ECW: Elijah Burke, Marcus Cor Von, Matt Striker and Kevin Thorn. In response, a stable of ECW Originals was created, and the teams continued to clash in singles and tag matches, trading wins on the weekly ECW show throughout the spring of 2007, while both sides tried to get CM Punk to side with them. The Originals won a standard-rules four-on-four match at WrestleMania 23, which would be Dreamer's first and only match ever on the maincard of a WrestleMania. The Originals lost an extreme-rules rematch on the following episode of ECW. The feud continued until a number of roster moves left both sides nearly barren, with it ending at One Night Stand when Dreamer, Sandman and Punk beating Burke, Cor Von and Striker in a Tables match. In late 2007, Dreamer took part in the ECW brand's elimination chase to name a number one contender to the ECW Championship. During the series of matches, also involving Stevie Richards, Elijah Burke, and Kevin Thorn he added a bandana, worn on his head, to his ring gear. He received the original one from a young boy with a brain tumor, and from then on began wearing one as a sign of solidarity and strength to anyone going through that struggle. Dreamer emerged victorious in the final match against Burke, only to be surprised by ECW's general manager Armando Estrada forcing him to face Big Daddy V, who promptly beat him for the number one contendership. ECW Championship pursuits (2008‚Äì2009) In early 2008, Dreamer would have one of his career highlights. Despite not being featured on TV leading up to the Royal Rumble, Dreamer would receive a loud ovation and chants from his hometown MSG crowd even with Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker in the match. In February, Dreamer was paired with ECW brand enhancement talent Colin Delaney as a sort of mentor after Delaney was consistently and easily defeated on the weekly ECW television show. They challenged The Miz and John Morrison for the WWE Tag Team Championship after they defeated them in a non-title match, but they lost the title match in an Extreme rules match in March. At WrestleMania XXIV, he participated in a pre-show 24-man battle royal to earn an opportunity for the ECW Championship in the event, a match that was won by Kane. Dreamer qualified for the five-way Singapore cane match at Extreme Rules: One Night Stand to determine a number one contender for the championship; Big Show would win the match. Following Mark Henry's ECW Championship win at Night of Champions, Dreamer was named his first challenger. At The Great American Bash, Dreamer was defeated by Henry for the championship after Colin Delaney turned on him and cost him the match. On the following ECW, Dreamer defeated Delaney and again on August 12, 2008 in an Extreme Rules Grudge Match which would be Delaney's final match in the WWE. Dreamer then turned his attention to Jack Swagger, who made disparaging remarks about Dreamer and ECW. They first faced off in an amateur wrestling match, which Dreamer was disqualified from for using his DDT on Swagger. Then Swagger defeated Dreamer in an Extreme rules match, ending the feud. ECW Champion and departure (2009‚Äì2010) On the January 13, 2009 episode of ECW, Dreamer announced that if he failed to win the ECW Championship by June 6, when his WWE contract was to expire, he would no longer wrestle for ECW. The storyline saw Dreamer start a losing streak that ended when he defeated Paul Burchill on the February 24 episode of ECW. On the April 28 episode of ECW, Dreamer received a match for the ECW Championship against then-champion Christian, which went to a no-contest when Jack Swagger interfered. On the May 21 episode of Superstars Dreamer had another title match with Christian which once again went to a no contest when Swagger interfered, believing he ruined Dreamer's last title chance. Dreamer was granted a one-day extension on his contract, allowing him one last chance at the ECW Championship, challenging the champion Christian and Jack Swagger in a triple threat match at Extreme Rules, where Dreamer pinned Jack Swagger in a hardcore triple threat match, capturing his second ECW Championship almost a decade after he claimed the title in the original ECW, being the only man to hold the belt in the original ECW and in the ECW brand of WWE. After successfully defending the title against Christian on the June 15 episode of Raw, Dreamer successfully defended the title in a Championship Scramble match at The Bash, before eventually losing the title back to Christian at Night of Champions. On the July 28 episode of ECW, Dreamer announced he would exercise his rematch clause against Christian the following week. The two faced off in an Extreme Rules match, in which Christian retained the championship. After his championship pursuit had ceased, Dreamer began teaming up with Christian, Yoshi Tatsu and Goldust on various occasions to take on William Regal and his allies Vladimir Kozlov and Ezekiel Jackson, exchanging victories and losses. On the December 29 episode of ECW, Dreamer wrestled Zack Ryder and lost. If Dreamer was to lose the match then he would be (kayfabe) forced to retire from in-ring competition. After the match, Dreamer made a farewell speech in which he thanked the fans before exiting the ring with his two daughters. A few days later on January 4, 2010, Dreamer was officially released by WWE. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010 - 2011)=  EV 2.0 (2010‚Äì2011)  Dreamer at a TNA Impact! television taping in 2010 On June 13, 2010, at Slammiversary VIII Dreamer made his debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, appearing in the crowd and thus distracting Brother Ray and costing him his match against Jesse Neal. On the June 24 episode of Impact! Dreamer appeared in the crowd of the Impact! Zone, beside fellow ECW alumni Raven and Stevie Richards. The following week the three were joined by Rhino. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Dreamer, Raven, Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Al Snow, led by Mick Foley, aligned themselves with the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam by attacking Abyss and the rest of the TNA locker room. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay‚Äìper‚Äìview event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company, while also placing Dreamer in charge of the show. Dreamer made his TNA in‚Äìring debut on the July 29 episode of Impact!, losing to Abyss in a No Disqualification match. After the match Raven re‚Äìignited his old feud with Dreamer by turning on him, laying him out with a DDT on a chair and licking his face. The following week Raven explained his turn by saying that he hadn't forgotten how Dreamer had \\"stolen\\", and later married, his girlfriend Beulah McGillicutty back in 1996; also on that show Dreamer teamed with Van Dam to beat Abyss and Raven. On August 8 at Hardcore Justice, Dreamer was defeated by Raven in a \\"Final Showdown\\" (Final Singles match) match refereed by Mick Foley and featuring appearances by Beulah McGillicutty, \\"Lupus\\", \\"The Blue Meanie\\" and Hollywood Nova. On the following episode of Impact!, the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair's stable, who thought they didn't deserve to be in TNA. The following week TNA president Dixie Carter gave each member of EV 2.0 TNA contracts in order for them to settle their score with . At No Surrender Dreamer lost an \\"I Quit\\" match to A.J. Styles due to Styles putting a fork into his eye. Dreamer admitted EV 2.0's defeat on the following episode of Impact! and tried to reach a truce with , but was beaten down. The following week he returned with Raven, Stevie Richards, Sabu and Rhino and announced that Dixie Carter had given the five of them a Lethal Lockdown match against at Bound for Glory. At Bound for Glory Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Richards and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match, when Dreamer pinned Styles. After weeks of dissension between Rob Van Dam and the rest of EV 2.0, caused by Van Dam's belief that there was a traitor within the group, Dreamer challenged him to a match. At Turning Point Van Dam defeated Dreamer and afterwards made peace with him. On the following episode of Impact!, Rhino turned heel by attacking Van Dam and Dreamer, revealing himself as the traitor Van Dam had been looking for. The following week Dreamer defeated Rhino in a Street Fight, but he suffered an injured wrist during the match. After spending some time off television, Dreamer returned on the February 24 episode of Impact!, becoming entangled in the feud between former tag team partners Bully Ray and Brother Devon. On March 13 at Victory Road, Dreamer defeated Ray in a Falls Count Anywhere match, following interference from Devon.  Immortal (2011)  On the May 5 episode of Impact!, Dreamer was forced attack A.J. Styles and to join Immortal in order to save his job in TNA. Dreamer was later confronted on his choice by A.J. Styles, which led to a match at Sacrifice, where Dreamer was victorious following interference from Bully Ray. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Dreamer officially turned heel, citing the first time he attacked Styles was due to being forced by Ray, before willingly attacking Styles because he wanted to and proceeding to berate the crowd by calling them \\"pieces of crap\\" for not sympathizing with his job situation. This is also the first time that Dreamer has wrestled as a heel since being a member of the Alliance during his WWF/E career.

In the non-commutative ring case the same definition does not always work. This has resulted in several radicals generalizing the commutative case in distinct ways. See the article \\"radical of a ring\\" for more on this. The nilradical of a Lie algebra is similarly defined for Lie algebras.  Commutative rings  The nilradical of a commutative ring is the set of all nilpotent elements in the ring, or equivalently the radical of the zero ideal. This is an ideal because the sum of any two nilpotent elements is nilpotent (by the binomial formula), and the product of any element with a nilpotent element is nilpotent (by commutativity). It can also be characterized as the intersection of all the prime ideals of the ring (in fact, it is the intersection of all minimal prime ideals). Proposition: Let R be a commutative ring, \\\\mathfrak{N}_R=\\\\bigcap_{\\\\mathfrak{p}\\\\varsubsetneq R\\\\text{ prime}}\\\\mathfrak{p}. > Proof. Let r\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{N}_R and \\\\mathfrak{p} be a prime ideal, then r^n=0 > for some n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}.

A ring is called reduced if it has no nonzero nilpotent. Thus, a ring is reduced if and only if its nilradical is zero. If R is an arbitrary commutative ring, then the quotient of it by the nilradical is a reduced ring and is denoted by R_{\\\\text{red}}. Since every maximal ideal is a prime ideal, the Jacobson radical ‚Äî which is the intersection of maximal ideals ‚Äî must contain the nilradical. A ring R is called a Jacobson ring if the nilradical and Jacobson radical of R/P coincide for all prime ideals P of R. An Artinian ring is Jacobson, and its nilradical is the maximal nilpotent ideal of the ring. In general, if the nilradical is finitely generated (e.g., the ring is Noetherian), then it is nilpotent.  Noncommutative rings  For noncommutative rings, there are several analogues of the nilradical. The lower nilradical (or Baer‚ÄìMcCoy radical, or prime radical) is the analogue of the radical of the zero ideal and is defined as the intersection of the prime ideals of the ring. The analogue of the set of all nilpotent elements is the upper nilradical and is defined as the ideal generated by all nil ideals of the ring, which is itself a nil ideal. The set of all nilpotent elements itself need not be an ideal (or even a subgroup), so the upper nilradical can be much smaller than this set. The Levitzki radical is in between and is defined as the largest locally nilpotent ideal. As in the commutative case, when the ring is artinian, the Levitzki radical is nilpotent and so is the unique largest nilpotent ideal. Indeed, if the ring is merely noetherian, then the lower, upper, and Levitzki radical are nilpotent and coincide, allowing the nilradical of any noetherian ring to be defined as the unique largest (left, right, or two-sided) nilpotent ideal of the ring.

Biography McFadden was born in Hamilton, Ontario and began writing poetry while still in high school, publishing in literary magazines, corresponding with beat writer Jack Kerouac, and becoming a proofreader for the Hamilton Spectator newspaper. As he gained success as a poet he quit the newspaper devoting himself full-time to literature in 1976. McFadden served on the editorial board of Coach House Press, and as a contributing editor for SwiftCurrent and Canadian Art Magazine. He was a monthly columnist for Quill and Quire and Hamilton This Month. He taught at David Thompson University Centre for three years and was a member of the production team of the literary journal Brick. McFadden's poetry critiques the commercialism and shallowness of modern society. His work, with its overt humour, reflections on contemporary urban life, and interest in the mistakes of the imagination is influenced by Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery and the New York School of the 1950s, as well as the Beat writers of the 1960s such as Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. His work focuses on Canadian subjects, settings and personalities. His book of 100 Baudelaire-inspired prose poems, Gypsy Guitar, was called \\"everyone's favourite book of poems\\" by George Bowering. McFadden is a founding member of GOSH (Gentlemen of Sensible Height), and a former member of International PEN, the Writer's Union of Canada, the League of Canadian Poets, and the Last Minute Club. In 2012, McFadden was diagnosed with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, a type of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease that affects a person‚Äôs memory of words, and shortly thereafter he became one of the first participants in a study of the effects of aerobic exercise on people already affected by dementia.

They were reconferred on his third (but second surviving) son Charles Douglas, 2nd Earl of Selkirk, who thereby became 2nd Earl of Selkirk, and who also reverted to his original surname of \\"Douglas\\". Thus, while the eldest son was to inherit the title of Duke of Hamilton and have his mother's maiden name for surname, the younger son was to inherit his father's dignities and perpetuate the name of Douglas. This novodamus for this arrangement embodied a unique remainder, the effect of which was that: # the titles would pass to the heirs male of the 1st earl's younger sons before the heirs male of his eldest son (who was heir apparent to his mother's Dukedom of Hamilton); # if the person who would otherwise inherit the title was already duke of Hamilton (or would inherit that dukedom at the same time), the titles would pass instead to that duke's next surviving brother; # if the titles were ever held by a duke of Hamilton (either because an earl of Selkirk succeeded as duke of Hamilton, or because provision 2 was unable to operate because the heir was a duke of Hamilton who had no surviving younger brothers), the titles would pass on that duke's death to his second surviving son; # if the titles had passed to a younger brother or younger son under provisions 2 or 3, they would then pass to his heirs male on his death; but # if such a younger son or younger brother's heirs male died out, the title would not pass to his own younger brothers and their heirs male, but would instead revert to the senior male line, with provisions 2 and 3 operating as before.Heywood, p.71. This remainder is so unusual that a Scottish country dance‚ÄîHamilton House‚Äîwas created around it. The 2nd earl died childless in 1739, and his younger brother, John Hamilton, 1st Earl of Ruglen (who had been so created on 14 April 1697), succeeded as 3rd earl. He outlived his son and heir, and when he died in 1744 the Earldom of Ruglen and its subsidiary titles passed to his daughter Anne Douglas, Countess of March, and on her death in 1748 to William Douglas, 3rd Earl of March (later 4th Duke of Queensberry). The Earldom of Selkirk and its subsidiary title, being limited to male heirs, passed to Dunbar Hamilton, grandson of Lord Basil Hamilton, sixth son of the 1st earl. Upon succeeding as 4th earl, he, like the 2nd earl, changed his surname to \\"Douglas\\". On his death in 1799, he was succeeded by his only surviving son, Thomas Douglas, Lord Daer, as 5th earl, and he was then succeeded on his death in 1820 by his only son, Dunbar Douglas, Lord Daer, as 6th earl. On his death in 1885, the heirs male of the younger sons of the 1st earl expired. The heir male of the 1st earl's eldest son was William Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton, but under the special remainder (provision 2 above) the titles passed instead to his younger brother, Lord Charles Hamilton, who succeeded as 7th earl. When he died unmarried in 1886, the titles reverted to his elder brother, who had no further brothers to whom they could pass, and who accordingly succeeded as 8th earl. When he died without a son in 1895, the dukedom passed to his fourth cousin, Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, who succeeded as 13th duke of Hamilton. As he also had no brothers, he also succeeded as 9th earl of Selkirk. When he died in 1940, his eldest son, Douglas Douglas- Hamilton, Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale, inherited the dukedom, but the Earldom of Selkirk and its subsidiary title passed under the special remainder (provision 3 above) to his second son, Lord George Douglas-Hamilton, who succeeded as 10th earl. Upon the death of the 10th earl in 1994, married but childless, the titles passed (under provision 5 above) to his nephew, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, second son of the 14th Duke of Hamilton and next brother of Angus Douglas-Hamilton, 15th Duke of Hamilton, who succeeded as 11th earl. This succession was unsuccessfully challenged in the Court of the Lord Lyon by Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, son of Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton, next brother of the 10th Earl. Lord Malcolm had died in 1969 as heir presumptive to the 10th earl and his son was listed thereafter in that position by reference works such as Whitaker's Almanack (page 155 of 1992 edition) and Debrett's Peerage (page P1141 of the 1995 edition, which went to press before the 10th earl's death) but it was the ruling of the court that the death of the 14th duke in 1973 had placed the younger sons of the 14th duke ahead of the younger sons of the 13th duke and their issue in line to the earldom. The 11th earl was, at the time of his succession, the Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West, and he disclaimed the titles in order to remain in the House of Commons. He was later elevated to the House of Lords with a life peerage as Baron Selkirk of Douglas, and served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament. His heir (under provision 4 above) is John Douglas- Hamilton, Lord Daer, Master of Selkirk.

Everyone listed in the line of succession in the Duke of Hamilton article is eligible to succeed to the Earldom, but in the order dictated by its special remainder: the sons of Lord Selkirk of Douglas, starting with Lord Daer, come first (with potential male issue of any of them preceding younger brothers of that son), but should Lord Selkirk of Douglas survive all his male issue, or any future Earl of Selkirk die without a direct heir, the death of the 15th Duke of Hamilton in 2010 means that the younger son of the 15th Duke would rank ahead of lines from younger sons of the 14th Duke and the death of the 16th Duke would likewise move his younger sons to the head of the line.

History  xine was started in 2000 by G√ºnter Bartsch shortly after LinuxTag. At that time playing DVDs in Linux was described as a tortuous process since one had to manually create audio and video named pipes and start their separated decoder processes. G√ºnter realized the OMS (Open Media System) or LiViD approach had obvious shortcomings in terms of audio and video synchronization, so xine was born as an experiment trying to get it right. The project evolved into a modern media player multi-threaded architecture. During xine development, some effort was dedicated to making a clear separation of the player engine (xine-lib) and front-end (xine-ui). Since the 1.0 release (2004-12-25) the API of xine-lib is considered stable and several applications and players rely on it. G√ºnter left the project in 2003 when he officially announced the new project leaders, Miguel Freitas, Michael Roitzsch, Mike Melanson, and Thibaut Mattern.

However, without membership in the Forum, the project also cannot make xine play DVDs encrypted with CSS except by using reverse- engineered code. xine therefore uses the libdvdcss library, which was created by reverse engineering. The legal status of libdvdcss is questionable in several nations; in the United States, for example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act arguably prohibits reverse-engineering of CSS. Virtually all commercial DVDs are encrypted with CSS.  Other issues  To prevent a screensaver from starting, xine sends a scroll lock key signal to the environment to pretend keyboard interaction took place. This can often lead to issues with other programs running as they receive the scroll lock key as normal input. One example is the Konsole terminal emulator, which changes the behaviour of the arrow keys when scroll lock is used.  Graphical user interface  The xine project offers graphical front-ends for xine, including one based on Xlib and another on GTK+, along with a browser plugin.

In Final Fantasy VII, Cloud is a mercenary claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite supersoldiers employed by the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group AVALANCHE, and driven by a feud with the primary antagonist, Sephiroth, Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader. Cloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 computer- animated sequel film, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other Compilation of Final Fantasy VII titles, and is featured in several other games outside the Final Fantasy VII continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the Kingdom Hearts series by Square Enix, and in the Super Smash Bros. series by Nintendo. Cloud was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, a character artist for the Final Fantasy series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. Yoshinori Kitase, director of VII, and Kazushige Nojima, one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After VII, Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style. Cloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first unreliable narrators, and for the game's depiction of his mental disorder. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by Famitsu, Guinness, and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as action figures and jewelry. Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors, with Steve Burton and Cody Christian's English vocal performances being the subject of praise. Concept and design In contrast to Final Fantasy VI, which featured multiple \\"main characters\\", Square's staff decided at the outset of Final Fantasy VII's development that the game would follow a single identifiable protagonist. In Hironobu Sakaguchi's first plot treatment, a prototype for Cloud's character belonged to an organization attempting to destroy New York City's \\"Mako Reactors\\". After a pause in development so that the team could help finish Chrono Trigger, Square began experimenting with next-generation hardware. A small group including Kitase and Nomura worked in secret to develop a demo for a Nintendo 64 emulation kit running on an SGI Onyx. In addition to testing models ported from Square's 1995 SIGGRAPH demo, Nomura and a handful of other artists created new characters, including an early design of Cloud. Sakaguchi, impressed with Nomura's illustrations and detailed handwritten notes for Final Fantasy V and VI, tasked Nomura with designing Final Fantasy VII's main characters. Kitase and Nomura discussed that Cloud would be the lead of three protagonists, but Nomura did not receive character profiles or a completed scenario in advance. Left to imagine the stories behind the characters he designed, Nomura shared these details in discussions with staff or in separately penned notes. Frustrated by the continued popularity of Final Fantasy IV's characters despite the release of two sequels, Nomura made it his goal to create a memorable cast. Early sketches of Cloud's design by Tetsuya Nomura Cloud's design underwent several revisions. Nomura's first draft of Cloud featured slicked-back black hair to contrast with the long silver hair of the game's primary antagonist, Sephiroth, and to minimize the model's polygon count. However, to make Cloud stand out more and emphasize his role as the game's lead protagonist, Nomura altered Cloud's design to give him spiky, bright blond hair. Nomura also made Cloud taller than he appeared in the SGI Onyx demo, while a discarded iteration drawn \\"more on the realistic side\\" depicted Cloud with an even taller head and body and a more muscular physique. Yoshitaka Amano, who had handled character illustrations for previous Final Fantasy titles, painted promotional images for the game by taking Nomura's \\"drawings and put[ting his] own spin on them\\". According to Amano, because of the hardware limitations of the PlayStation, the platform Square had settled on for Final Fantasy VII, characters could not be rendered realistically. Amano thought Cloud's baggy pants, which taper at the bottom, reflected a \\"very ... Japanese style\\", resembling the silhouette of a hakama. The contrast between Cloud, a \\"young, passionate boy\\", and Sephiroth, a \\"more mature and cool\\" individual, struck Amano as \\"intriguing\\", though not unusual as a pairing. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura imagined a rivalry mirroring that of Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojir≈ç, with Cloud and Sephiroth representing Musashi and Kojir≈ç, respectively. Nomura's notes listed Cloud's job as . Early renditions of Cloud's weapon, the , depicted a smaller, thinner blade. Variations included additions such as a small chain connected to the pommel, magnets that would secure the blade to Cloud's back, and a more detailed design that resembled a \\"Western-style sword\\". The Buster Sword's blade grew in subsequent illustrations, and Nomura called it \\"the Giant Kitchen Knife\\", envisioning it as unrefined steel. Square's staff conceived of a minigame involving Cloud driving a motorcycle at the start of the game's development, and Nomura's illustrations included Cloud riding a , a Shinra motorcycle. Kitase and Nojima developed Cloud's backstory and his relationship to Sephiroth. While drafting the game's scenario, Nojima saw a standing animation created by event planner Motomu Toriyama that depicted \\"Cloud showing off\\". The animation impressed Nojima and inspired the idea that Cloud had developed a false persona. This later led Nojima to create Zack Fair, a SOLDIER whom Cloud aspired to be like, to expand on the mystery of Cloud's past. Nojima left the unfolding of events regarding Cloud's identity unwritten, and Kitase remained unaware of the significance of Zack's addition until playtesting. Kitase reviewed Nojima's scenario and felt that Cloud, being neither single-minded nor righteous, offered a fresh take on a protagonist. The love triangle between Cloud, Tifa Lockhart, and Aerith Gainsborough was also viewed as novel for the series. Nojima likened Cloud and Tifa's relationship to one of friends since nursery school, and compared Aerith to a transfer student arriving mid-term. In early scripts, Sephiroth would have deceived Cloud into thinking Sephiroth had created him, and Sephiroth could exert control over Cloud's movements. As in the finished game, Cloud would discover the truth that Shinra's experiments and his own insecurities had made him susceptible to Sephiroth's manipulation. Cloud would have also somehow injured Tifa prior to the game's events, leaving her with memory loss of the event and a large scar on her back. Kitase rejected a proposed scene written by Masato Kato involving Cloud and Tifa walking out of a Chocobo stable the morning before the final battle, with Tifa following only after checking around. Kitase found it \\"too intense,\\" and Nojima described the proposal as \\"extreme\\"; however, Kitase maintained a toned-down scene written by Kato depicting the night before, which has Tifa speak a risqu√© line of dialogue before a fade to black. According to Nojima, none of the staff expected that the scene, despite \\"the line in question\\", \\"would be something so important\\". Nojima wanted to write scenes in such a way that players themselves could decide what Cloud was thinking. Nojima used Cloud's foggy memories as a device to provide details about the world that would be unknown to the player but considered common knowledge to its inhabitants. To emphasize Cloud's personality, event planners repeated elements they found interesting such as Toriyama's standing animation and Cloud's use of the phrase \\"not interested\\". In retrospective, Nomura and Final Fantasy VII Remake co-director Naoki Hamaguchi have described Cloud as a \\"dorky character\\". According to Nomura, although post-Final Fantasy VII titles featuring Cloud have emphasized his \\"cool side\\", \\"in the original game, Cloud had many comical or lame moments\\". Nomura believes that the reason Cloud became popular with audiences is due to the impact Cloud's personality made in Nojima's scenario. =Further development= Advent Children characterization For Advent Children, Nomura agreed to direct the project largely because of his attachment to the character of Cloud. Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in Final Fantasy VII than in Advent Children, he did not believe that such an \\"'upbeat' image of him is what stuck in the minds of the fans\\", and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind \\"consistent with the fans' view of him.\\" Nomura describes Cloud's life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing. Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself. In contrast to other heroes, who, in Nomura's view, typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks, Nomura believed Cloud's weakness to be humanizing. Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship. Cloud, by taking up his sword and fighting, struggles to achieve it. Nojima sought to establish Cloud's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone, but never answering any calls. He originally intended for Aerith's name to be the last of those displayed while the backlog of ignored messages appears as Cloud's cell phone sinks into the water, but Nojima altered the scene because it \\"sounded too creepy\\". The wolf which Cloud imagines \\"represents the deepest part of Cloud's psyche\\" and \\"appears in response to some burden that Cloud is carrying deep in his heart\\", vanishing at the film's end. Nomura cites one of the film's final scenes, in which Cloud smiles, as his favorite, highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud's embarrassment. The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu's score, who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script, commenting on the difficulty players who had finished Final Fantasy VII would have had imagining Cloud's smile. Nomura sought to make Cloud's design \\"distinctly different from the other characters.\\" About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which \\"looked gross.\\" Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of \\"clothes designed for action\\", the staff began with the idea of a black robe, eventually parring it down to a \\"long apron\\" shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't \\"logically thought out\\" and the staff didn't think that they could \\"make it work physically\\", it was believed to provide \\"an interesting accent to the story.\\" Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's \\"Hardy-Daytona\\" motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film. In the original game, Cloud's strongest technique was the swordplay . For his fight against Sephiroth in the film, Nomura proposed a new move, the , which is a faster version of the original Omnislash. The staff laughed at the name given to Cloud's move during the making of it as Nomura was inspired by a sport move from Final Fantasy X whose protagonist, Tidus, explained the addition of a more specific name would make people be more excited. Studio: Square Enix. Themes expanded in the director's cut Advent Children Complete include Cloud's development with links to other Final Fantasy VII related media where he appeared. In order to further focus on Cloud's growth, Square decided to give him more scenes when he interacts with children. Additionally, the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was expanded by several minutes, and includes a scene in which Sephiroth impales Cloud on his sword and holds him in the air, mirroring the scene in the game where he performs the same action. The decision to feature Cloud suffering from blood loss in the fight was made in order to make the character's pain feel realistic. Remake handling Cloud riding the Hardy-Daytona bike Final Fantasy VII Remake which used a more realistic design. In the making of the fighting game Dissidia: Final Fantasy, Nomura stated that Cloud's appearance was sightly slimmer than in Final Fantasy VII due to the amount of detail that the 3D could the PlayStation Portable game could give him. While also retaining his original design and his Advent Children appearance, Cloud was given a more distinct look based on his Final Fantasy VII persona. Cloud's initial redesign for Final Fantasy VII Remake departed more dramatically from the original's, but was later altered to more closely resemble Nomura's original design. In an early event from Final Fantasy VII, Cloud crossdresses in order to find Tifa. Nomura noted this event was popular with the fans and reassured the remake will keep this part. On the other hand, the character designer stated that their final design was not decided yet. Kazushige Nojima is worked into making Cloud's interactions with Tifa and Barret natural. Despite fear of the possible end result, Nojima also wants the players to connect with the character once again. Kitase further claims that in the remake they aimed to make Cloud more inexperienced and more informal than in Advent Children due to not still having mature. The main reason for Cloud acting more reckless than people of his age was due to how he spent five years in coma as revealed in the past game so he was made to have social problems. One example was Cloud trying to emotionally support Tifa during a sad scene, imitating Barret's actions but he fails to cause the same impact. As a result, the staff states that Cloud is a teenager trying to act like an adult in this scenario. When it comes to being close to other characters, Cloud is annoyed by the flirts of Jessie but instead tries acting cool with Aerith. For, Square made Aerith warn Cloud of not getting emotionally attached to her, giving the players multiple interpretations in regards of this in case they are warned of Aerith's tragic fate or instead just looking down on him. In the climax of the remake, Cloud encounters his nemesis, Sephiroth, once again. Sephiroth's words following the fight were kept as ambiguous. Co-director Naoki Hamaguchi noted that since in the original game, the player could decide Cloud's interest in a female character, he wanted the remake to give this possibility again in the form of an intimate conversation when splitting from the main team. Due to Cloud being in a possible relationship with Tifa or Aerith, the development team observed fans thought Square was preferring any of these two heroines over the other. In retrospective, Square states that Aerith might have been real main character of the game while Tifa was important in order to help develop Cloud's character. As a result, Square claims that both Tifa and Aerith are heroines in this remake. The theme song \\"Hollow\\" is meant to reflect Cloud's state of mind with Nomura placing high emphasis on the rock music and male vocals. =Voice actors= For the Ehrgeiz fighting game, Kenyu Horiuchi provided Cloud's voice in the arcade version while Nozomu Sasaki replaced him in the home console version. Teruaki Sugawara, the voice director behind Kingdom Hearts, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of video game The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character other than Cloud. For Advent Children, Nomura wanted to contrast Cloud and Vincent's voices given their similar personalities. As a sequel to the highly popular Final Fantasy VII, Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than he did when he voiced Cloud for Kingdom Hearts. Sakurai received comments from colleagues revealing their love of the game, some of them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive Sakurai if he did not meet their expectations. During recording, Sakurai was told that \\"[n]o matter what kind of odds are stacked against him, Cloud won't be shaken.\\" Sakurai says that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside Ayumi Ito, who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling \\"deflated\\", as the \\"exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful\\", Sakurai commenting that Cloud‚Äîwhom he empathized with as his voice actor‚Äîhas a hard time dealing with straight talk. Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete, with very precise directions being given requiring multiple takes. According to Sakurai, Cloud's silence conveys more about the character than when he speaks. While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud's outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects. A fan of VII, Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental. After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans' response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him. While recording Crisis Core, Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud's scream over Zack's death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending. Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a Final Fantasy VII fan himself, he is happy to contribute. In regards to the remake of Final Fantasy VII, Sakurai found the younger Cloud difficult to portray due to how different he is in this game and thus hoped to get attached to this incarnation of him. While making multiple takes to perform better deliveries, Sakurai thanks the sound director for aiding him. Nomura also said that while Cloud acts cool in Final Fantasy VII he often fails and thus ends acting in awkward fashion he thought would bother Sakurai in regards to recording of the game. Finding a suitable actor for Cloud's younger persona during the flashbacks where he interacts with Tifa was also challenging for the developers. In order to find a suitable actor the staff thought about hiring a child living in a rural area. Nevertheless, Square believed the actor given for the young Cloud was suitable, fitting his gentle with Tifa's voice. The chosen actor was Yukihiro Aizawa. In English adaptations, Cloud is voiced by Steve Burton. Burton was first hired to voice Cloud once a man behind Square saw his work in the 2001 movie The Last Castle. Burton's work as Cloud in Advent Children served as his first feature length role, an experience he enjoyed. Calling the character a rare opportunity for him as an actor, Burton describes Cloud as having a \\"heaviness about him\\". Burton says he is surprised when fans recognize him for his work as Cloud, whom he has referred to as \\"[one of the] coolest characters there is,\\" and he too considers himself lucky for having voiced him. Although Cloud was originally depicted as a silent character in Final Fantasy VII, Burton confirmed his wish to voice him for the remake of the game. But in June 2019, Burton was replaced by Cody Christian in the remake, with Burton thanking Square for his work and wishing luck to Christian. Christian appreciated the role, finding the character iconic due to his personality and thus looked forward to give his best performance. Christian commented on him being Burton's replacement, stating, \\"Steve, you paved the way. You made this character what it is and have contributed in shaping a legacy\\" and thus wanted to not let Burton down with his take on the character. Christian used Burton's works as an inspiration for his portrayal of the character. Meanwhile, teenage Cloud present in the flashback was voiced by Major Dodson. Appearances =In Final Fantasy VII= Cloud is introduced as a mercenary employed by AVALANCHE, an eco-terrorist group opposed to the Shinra Company. Beginning the game with the placeholder name , Cloud assists AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace, in bombing a Mako reactor, power plants which drain the planet's \\"Lifestream\\". Cloud claims to be formerly of SOLDIER 1st Class, an elite Shinra fighting unit.Square (September 7, 1997). Final Fantasy VII. PlayStation. Sony Computer Entertainment America. \\"Barret: Yo. Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya. Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today? / Cloud: None. I'm positive. / Barret: You sound pretty sure. / Cloud: If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here now. / Barret: Don't go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER.\\" Despite appearing detached, Cloud demonstrates moments of camaraderie, Players can choose to interact in a friendlier manner with AVALANCHE's members. When approached by his childhood friend and AVALANCHE member, Tifa Lockhart, Cloud agrees to continue helping AVALANCHE. Cloud encounters Aerith Gainsborough, a resident of Midgar's slums. Agreeing to serve as her bodyguard in exchange for a date, Cloud helps Aerith evade Shinra, who pursue her because she is the sole survivor of a race known as the Cetra. During the course of their travels, a love triangle develops between Cloud, Tifa and Aerith. Following the player's departure from Midgar, Cloud narrates his history with Sephiroth, a legendary member of SOLDIER and the game's primary antagonist, and the events that led to Sephiroth's disappearance five years prior. Joining SOLDIER to emulate Sephiroth, Cloud explains that he would sign up for a \\"big mission\\" whenever they became available, as the conclusion of Shinra's war with the people of Wutai ended his chances for military fame. Sephiroth started questioning his humanity after accompanying him on a job to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim, discovering documents concerning Jenova, an extraterrestrial lifeform and Sephiroth's \\"mother\\". This ultimately led to Sephiroth burning down Nibelheim. Cloud confronted Sephiroth in the Mt Nibel's Mako Reactor and was believed to have killed him, but Cloud dismisses this as a lie as he knows he would be no match for Sephiroth. He is troubled with the fact that despite most likely losing the fight, he lived after challenging Sephiroth. However, numerous visual and audio clues suggest the unreliability of Cloud's memory. Cloud will spontaneously remember words or scenes from his past, sometimes collapsing to the ground while cradling his head, and appears not to remember things that he should remember, such as the existence of a SOLDIER First Class named Zack. As Sephiroth starts manipulating his mind, he takes advantage of it by telling him that his past is merely a fiction and that Shinra created Cloud in an attempt to clone Sephiroth. Cloud learns he cannot remember things like how or when he joined SOLDIER. Cloud, resigning himself as a \\"failed experiment\\", goes missing. The party later discovers a comatose Cloud suffering from Mako poisoning. It is revealed that Cloud never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra's army. During the mission to Nibelheim, Cloud served under Sephiroth and Zack, hiding his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth's defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, Cloud managed to ambush him and throw him into the Lifestream, and believed him dead. Both he and Zack are then imprisoned by Shinra's lead scientist, Hojo, for experimentation. Zack later escapes with Cloud, bringing him to the outskirts of Midgar before Shinra soldiers gun Zack down. Due to exposure to Mako radiation and the injection of Jenova's cells, Cloud's mind creates a false personality largely based on Zack's, inadvertently erasing the latter from his memory. After piecing back together his identity, Cloud resumes his role as leader. At the game's conclusion, Sephiroth reappears in Cloud's mind a final time, but he is defeated in a one- on-one fight.Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) (in Japanese). Square Enix. 2009. pp. 76‚Äì81. . =In Compilation of Final Fantasy VII= Cloud was redesigned for the 2005 film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and had his Buster Sword replaced with the pictured Fusion Swords and bike Fenrir. Cloud appears in a minor role in the cellphone game Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, a prequel set six years before Final Fantasy VII. The player, a member of the Shinra covert operatives group, the Turks, encounters Cloud during his time as a Shinra infantryman working to join SOLDIER. The game portrays Cloud's natural talent for swordsmanship, and recounts his role during Nibelheim's destruction. In the 2005 computer- animated film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, set two years following the conclusion of Final Fantasy VII, Cloud lives with Tifa in the city of Edge, along with Marlene, Barret's adopted daughter, and Denzel, an orphan afflicted with a rampant and deadly disease called Geostigma. Having given up his life as a mercenary, Cloud works as a courier for the that Tifa set up in her new bar. Confronted by Tifa following the disappearance of Denzel and Marlene, it is revealed that he also suffers from the effects of Geostigma, and he responds that he is unfit to protect his friends and new family. However, when urged by Tifa to let go of the past, Cloud sets out for the Forgotten City in search of the children. There, Cloud confronts Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo, genetic remnants of Sephiroth left behind before he diffused into the Lifestream completely. Cloud's battle with Kadaj later takes them back to Aerith's church, where Cloud recovers from his Geostigma with Aerith's help. Kadaj, merging with the remains of Jenova, resurrects Sephiroth. Cloud, having overcome his doubts, defeats Sephiroth once more, leaving a dying Kadaj in his place. At the film's conclusion, Cloud, seeing Aerith and Zack, assures the two that he will be fine and reunites with his friends. Cloud appears in On the Way to a Smile, a series of short stories set between Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children. \\"Case of Tifa\\" serves as an epilogue to VII, and portrays Cloud's life alongside Tifa, Marlene, and Denzel. \\"Case of Denzel\\" relates how Cloud first met Denzel, and was later adapted as a short original video animation for the release of Advent Children Complete, On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel. Cloud acts in a supporting role in the PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII. A year after the events of Advent Children, Cloud, working alongside Barret and Tifa, lends his support to the ground forces of the World Regenesis Organization and his ally Vincent Valentine in their siege of Midgar and counterattack against the rogue Shinra military unit, Deepground. In the PlayStation Portable game Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Cloud is presented as a young Shinra infantryman who befriends Zack. During the game's conclusion, a dying Zack gives Cloud his Buster Sword, telling him that he is his legacy. The game ends with Cloud heading to Midgar, reprising the start of Final Fantasy VII. Zack and Cloud's connection was also meant to be expanded upon near the game's ending, with both of them planning to flee to Midgar. However, due to limitations in the console's hardware, these scenes could not be implemented, and instead, they decided to focus on Zack. Cloud reprises his role from the original Final Fantasy VII in the 2020 remake, which is also part of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. While marketed as a remake to the original 1997 game, Square claims that there are other different meanings in this game. =In Kingdom Hearts= Nomura redesigned Cloud for his appearance in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a crimson cape and a clawed version of his left-handed glove, while the Buster Sword's blade is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained that he wanted to give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura also stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. In the first game, Kingdom Hearts, Cloud appears in the Olympus Coliseum world. Hired by Hades to kill Hercules, Cloud must fight Sora as a prerequisite. After the fight, Hades sends Cerberus to attack Cloud and Sora, who is then saved by Hercules. Cloud meets with Sora afterward and explains that he is searching for someone. In Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix there is an additional scene where he battles Sephiroth. During the credit roll at the end of the game, Cloud is shown reuniting residents of Hollow Bastion. A memory-based version of Cloud appears in the Game Boy Advance sequel Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories as a boss in the Olympus Coliseum and later as a summon card for Sora. Cloud reappears in Kingdom Hearts II, this time depicted in his Advent Children design. He is searching for Sephiroth, and is himself being sought out by Tifa. Cloud fights alongside Leon's team during the Heartless invasion of Hollow Bastion. Should the player choose to engage Sephiroth and win the battle, Cloud returns and fights Sephiroth, which ends with both of them disappearing in a flash of light after Tifa gives Cloud her support. Sora concludes that Cloud is still fighting with Sephiroth, and will not stop until he is defeated. A digital replica of Cloud also appears in Kingdom Hearts coded in the Olympus Coliseum, helping Sora and Hercules to battle Hades. Besides the video games, Cloud also appears in the Kingdom Hearts manga adaptations, reprising his original role. =In other media= The OVA Last Order: Final Fantasy VII serves as an alternate retelling of Nibelheim's destruction and Zack and Cloud's escape from Shinra imprisonment. Animated and produced by Madhouse, based on a script by Kazuhiko Inukai, several scenes diverge from Final Fantasy VII's depiction of events, such as reinterpreting Cloud's rescue of Tifa by having her view his face. Although it is associated with and makes references to the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Last Order is considered an outside work. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama oversaw Cloud's mobile-phone game. Cloud's character has also appeared in various games outside of the Final Fantasy VII continuity. He is a playable character in the PlayStation version of Ehrgeiz. In Chocobo Racing, Cloud is a hidden character that rides a motorcycle. Cloud is one of several playable Final Fantasy VII characters in Itadaki Street Special for the PlayStation 2 and Itadaki Street Portable for the PlayStation Portable. LittleBigPlanet 2 features Cloud as a downloadable character model. Cloud is a playable character representing Final Fantasy VII in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, with his Advent Children persona serving as downloadable content. Players in Final Fantasy Explorers can briefly transform into Cloud, enabling use of his Omnislash Limit Break from Final Fantasy VII. Cloud is the protagonist of Final Fantasy VII G-Bike, a mobile game for which Nomura designed a new costume for him. This was inspired by Cloud's Advent Children fights which producer Ichiro Hazama thought was \\"very cool, and radical\\", and influences from the title went into the game. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama sought to improve Cloud's popularity with this game. Cloud appears as a playable guest character in the 2014 Nintendo crossover fighting games Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, sporting his character designs from both Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children. According to the games' director Masahiro Sakurai, Final Fantasy characters were heavily requested to appear in the Super Smash Bros. series, with Cloud receiving the most support out of all of them. Reflecting on his inclusion in an interview with Tetsuya Nomura, while other characters from the Final Fantasy series were considered Sakurai ultimately felt that none of them could match Cloud's popularity and he could not imagine including a character that wasn't him. His model was primarily based on his appearance in the Dissidia series, with slight alterations under Nomura's supervision. He was revealed in the November 2015 Nintendo Direct broadcast and was made available as in-game downloadable content alongside a stage based on Midgar, and a Mii Fighter hat based on a Chocobo on December 15, 2015. He returns as a playable character in the 2018 sequel, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and is now playable in the game's base roster. A pair of Cloud Strife amiibo figures were released on July 21, 2017. Cloud was a candidate guest character for Soulcalibur II but he was replaced by Heihachi Mishima from Tekken, which similarly to Soulcalibur is a Namco fighting game franchise that even shares Yoshimitsu as a regular character for both series. In the PlayStation game Final Fantasy Tactics and its PlayStation Portable update, Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Cloud is accidentally pulled into the world of Ivalice by an ancient machine called \\"the Celestial Globe\\", which was activated by Ramza Beoulve. Cloud is disoriented after arriving in Ramza's world, and after a short exchange with Ramza and the others, he leaves. He wanders into Zarghidas Trade City, where he encounters a flower girl named Aerith. As Cloud is leaving the area, Aerith is accosted by a man demanding payment. Cloud returns to help Aerith escape, and Ramza and his party catch up to him. After the battle, he joins Ramza's party as a playable character. Cloud also appears as an enemy unit in the \\"Brave Story\\" series of battles as part of Rendezvous, the unlockable cooperative multiplayer mode in The War of the Lions. Cloud serves as the representative hero of Final Fantasy VII in Dissidia Final Fantasy, a fighting game featuring characters from the Final Fantasy series. He is depicted in his Final Fantasy VII design, while his Advent Children design is also available. His fight against Sephiroth in this game is based on their battles from Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children. Along with the entire cast, Cloud reappears in the prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy as a Warrior of Chaos. Concerned for Tifa, who is on the opposing side, Cloud tries to defeat Chaos alone; after nearly being killed, he is saved by the goddess Cosmos, and becomes one of her warriors. Cloud's main outfit is based on Yoshitaka Amano's original artwork concept, while his Kingdom Hearts outfit is offered as downloadable content. Cloud again appears as a playable character opposite Sephiroth in the series' third entry, Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, wearing his Advent Children outfit. The development stuff worked carefully to translate Cloud's original moves from his previous role, most notably his swordplay Omnislash which was developed to be his strongest move. Although Cloud does not appear in Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, his Final Fantasy VII attire appears as an alternative for the main character alongside the Buster Sword. The Advent Children outfit is also present in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Cloud's original attire is also present in the mobile phone game Mobius Final Fantasy, and Final Fantasy Explorers-Force Cultural impact =Critical reception= Cloud has been mostly well received by critics. In his review of the 1998 PC release of Final Fantasy VII, Ron Dulin of GameSpot commented that \\"a simple understatement will have to suffice: Cloud is easily the most interesting and complex character ever presented in a game.\\" RPGamer's Abadi Aujang called Cloud \\"one of the most complex characters Square has created\\", as well as \\"the first truly complicated main character\\". Unicorn Lynx of MobyGames described him as \\"one of the most complex characters ever seen in a game\\", citing the struggle Cloud faces in assuming responsibility as a leader while confronting \\"his own deep psychological problems\\" and \\"the truth about his very existence\\". Sharon Packer identifies Cloud as having mental illness in the form of dissociative identity disorder (DID), while Katie Whitlock identifies him as having involuntary memory resulting from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra stated that Cloud is \\"somewhat of a weakling\\" suffering from grandiose delusions and other psychological issues. He also called Cloud one of the first unreliable narrators in a role-playing video game. According to Patrick Holleman, \\"no RPG has ever deliberately betrayed the connection between protagonist and player like FFVII does.\\" The game's use of the unreliable narrator literary concept has drawn comparisons to films such as Fight Club (1999), The Sixth Sense (1999), American Psycho (2000), and Memento (2000), with Patrick Holleman and Jeremy Parish arguing that the game takes the unreliable narrator concept a step further, by its interactivity establishing a connection between the player and the protagonist. Jack Ridsdale of PCGamesN argues that Cloud is a deconstruction of the hero archetype and toxic masculinity, and compares the plot twist about his true identity to that of Fight Club. The book Japanese Culture Through Videogames addresses Cloud as a complex fictional character, comparing him with Metal Gears Solid Snake, Final Fantasy VIs Terra Branford and Tekkens Jin Kazama due to his identity issues. Chi Kong Lui, writing for GameCritics, stated that while Final Fantasy VII features \\"some of the most complex characters ever created, by video game standards\\", their personalities are \\"paper-thin\\". He criticized Cloud's \\"childish motivations\\", stating that Final Fantasy VII could not \\"match the depth of screenplay in Orson Welles' Citizen Kane or the complexities of characters exhibited in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver\\". GamesRadar liked the cross-dressing scene in the game. Cloud and Aerith's tragic relationship was also popular with writers. Cloud and Terra were also compared with Zidane Tribal from Final Fantasy IX as they all shared existential crisis upon realizing that they are not who they actually think they are, something which was noted to be common Japanese role-playing game from 1990s by the time Zidane debuted, making him repetitive instead. Cloud's redesign in Kingdom Hearts was praised of the best in the game by PSXetreme and Animefringer. His development in Advent Children was praised by DVD Talk as one of the best parts from the film. Cloud's guilt over Aerith's death was effective enough to move viewers, Newtype USA also praised Cloud's role in Advent Children due to his heroic traits despite being a reluctant hero. Joystiq's Andrew Yoon opined that the director's cut version of the film provides more depth to Cloud's development, taking advantage of its longer runtime by better \\"humanizing [him]\\". GamesRadar stated that while Cloud felt like a \\"miserable\\" character in the film, his coming to terms with his past was appealing alongside his new swords stored in his bike. Yoshinori Kitase stated that the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was popular enough to make Japanese gamers do a remake of it for the crossover Dissidia Final Fantasy and expected Western fans also emulate it. Steve Burton's performance in Advent Children was also praised to the point of being one of the best English actors. In a poll, Cloud was voted as one of the best characters voiced by Takahiro Sakurai. Meristation praised Cloud's new appearance in Advent Children and how it came across appealing in the spin-off Dirge of Cerberus even if he was no longer the main character and thus had less screentime. When deciding on using a Final Fantasy representative for Nintendo's crossover fighting games Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Nomura and Super Smash Bros. series creator and director Masahiro Sakurai quickly agreed with adding Cloud to the cast. This was mostly because of Cloud's high popularity within the series in contrast to other Final Fantasy characters like Bartz or Terra, and multiple requests from fans of the character by extension. According to Sakurai, he envisioned Cloud as being a relatively easy to play character in anticipation of a large variety of players using him, and stated that the Buster Sword served as a lynchpin in regard to developing his sword swings. Cloud's popularity and addition to the Super Smash Bros. series generated multiple response, most notably in Twitter's trends. Although The Verge pointed out that such a crossover game also featured similar characters like Solid Snake, as well as title characters Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog, they nevertheless expressed surprise over Cloud's inclusion because of Final Fantasy VIIs lack of release on a Nintendo console. The impact of Cloud's inclusion in the Super Smash Bros. series would later be referenced when Persona 5s Joker was included in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, due to both characters being more present in Sony's games. Den of Geek ranked Cloud as one of the best Super Smash Bros. characters because of the idea of seeing him fight against other famous Nintendo characters. During anticipation for the remake of Final Fantasy VII, Cloud's role in the trailers were the focus of multiple journalists. IGN highly praised the design and marketing involving his visual appearance. TechSpot noted fans were interested in Cloud's love interests but claimed that Cloud's relationship with Aerith was subtle in retrospective. CBR also looked forward to this love triangle. Despite noting his antisocial attitudes in the remake, IGN, Metro and GameSpot commented Cloud is the character who has through the most notable arc in the entire remake with Christian's performance helping to improve his appeal. In a feature article, GameSpot compared Cloud with Kazuma Kiryu from Sega's Yakuza video game series due to both sharing similar features and development across the narrative through Midgar. =Popularity and other influences in the media= Cloud set a trend in the Final Fantasy series in regards to the characterization of main characters. Following Final Fantasy VII, Nomura designed Squall Leonhart, the lead of Final Fantasy VIII giving him a similar anti-hero persona. Tasked with creating a \\"female version of Cloud\\" for Final Fantasy XIII, Nomura designed Lightning with Cloud's success in mind, stating that he \\"desired for her to be ... loved for a long time, like Cloud.\\" After Lightning was voted as the most popular female character in the series by Japanese fans, Mollie Patterson of EGMNOW commented: \\"Some have also brought up that Lightning is kind of the female equivalent to Cloud, which might be why she gets so much love.\\" However, for Final Fantasy X, the staff aimed for a more contrasting hero would act more cheerful in the narrative, Tidus. Similarly, Nomura created Noctis Lucis Caelum from Final Fantasy XV with another different characterization from Cloud and Squall's and instead more insecure. IGN stated that Cloud set a trend for role-playing video game heroes, describing his \\"spiky blond hair\\" and \\"gigantic Buster Sword\\" as \\"instantly identifiable icons, recognized by gamers around the world\\". Edge described Cloud as an example of \\"excellent design and characterization\\". Famitsu in 2010 published a seven-page tribute to Cloud, showcasing his many appearances throughout the years. In 2014, IGN held a poll for fans to vote for the most favorite Final Fantasy character of all time, as well as individually in each title. Over 2 million votes were cast in. Cloud ranked number one of all the characters. He also took the same place in the Final Fantasy VII title alone as well. In 2013, Complex ranked Cloud as the eighth greatest soldier in video games. In 2005, Electronic Gaming Monthly placed Cloud seventh in their list of top video game characters. He was named best character of all time in Dengeki PlayStations 2007 \\"Den-Play Awards\\". IGN in 2008 ranked him third in both their lists of top Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy series characters. GameSpot published a video titled \\"Greatest Game Hero: Cloud Strife\\" for his inclusion in their 2009 \\"All Time Greatest Game Hero\\" poll, showcasing scenes of Cloud as he appears in Advent Children. UGO Networks placed him first in their 2010 list of top Japanese RPG characters, stating \\"Cloud is the cloth from whom the great majority of JRPG characters were cut.\\" That same year, GamesRadar listed Cloud as the second best Final Fantasy hero of all the time, describing him as \\"one of the most well-rounded and thought-out characters in the series.\\" He was also ranked as the second best Final Fantasy character in a 2010 list by VideoGamer.com, who called him a \\"poster boy for the entire JRPG genre\\". In 2011, Empire ranked Cloud as the 13th greatest video game character, stating: \\"He is, and always will be, the definitive FF poster child ‚Äì an enduring axiom of character .\\" GameZone ranked Cloud second in their 2012 list of top Final Fantasy characters, attributing the success of Final Fantasy VII largely to his character. In 2013, Complex named him the greatest Final Fantasy character of all time, citing his \\"killer backstory, iconic weaponry, and a great game to the boot.\\" In an Oricon poll conducted in 2008, Cloud placed second overall for most popular video game character, ranking second among men and third with women. In a 2010 ASCII Media Works poll asking fans which video game or manga character they would like to name their children after, Cloud's name ranked third for male characters. That same year, Famitsu readers voted Cloud as the third best video game character of all time. In the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition of 2011, Cloud was voted as the fifth best video game character. In promoting the Final Fantasy VII remake, artwork of Cloud was used in buildings from Los Angeles. =Merchandise= Cloud has been merchandised extensively, in many different forms, including figurines and jewelry. In commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of him alongside other Final Fantasy protagonists. Square Enix's manager of merchandise, Kanji Tashiro, said at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International that Cloud's likeness has produced some of the company's best-selling items, and that fans could look forward to further adaptations of the character in the future. Popular models at the time included Cloud's Advent Children figurine and Final Fantasy VII Hardy-Daytona bike set, both of which sold particularly well in European and North American markets. Square has also released two promotional books primarily focusing on Cloud's character: Cloud vol.1, which was released in 2007, and Cloud message, in 2008. In 2013, a replica of the Buster Sword was created by blacksmith Tony Swatton for the webseries Man at Arms.

More generally, any root of unity in a ring R is a unit: if , then is a multiplicative inverse of r. On the other hand, 0 is never a unit (except in the zero ring). A ring R is called a skew-field (or a division ring) if }, where U(R) is the group of units of R (see below). A commutative skew-field is called a field. For example, the units of the real numbers are }. =Integers= In the ring of integers , the only units are and . Rings of integers R= \\\\mathfrak O_F in a number field F have, in general, more units. For example, : in the ring , and in fact the unit group of this ring is infinite. In fact, Dirichlet's unit theorem describes the structure of precisely: it is isomorphic to a group of the form :\\\\mathbf Z^n \\\\oplus \\\\mu_R where \\\\mu_R is the (finite, cyclic) group of roots of unity in R and n, the rank of the unit group is :n=r_1 + r_2 -1, where r_1, r_2 are the numbers of real embeddings and the number of pairs of complex embeddings of F, respectively. This recovers the above example: the unit group of (the ring of integers of) a real quadratic field is infinite of rank 1, since r_1=2, r_2=0. In the ring of integers modulo , the units are the congruence classes represented by integers coprime to . They constitute the multiplicative group of integers modulo . =Polynomials and power series= For a commutative ring R, the units of the polynomial ring R[x] are precisely those polynomials :p(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + \\\\dots a_n x^n such that a_0 is a unit in R, and the remaining coefficients a_1, \\\\dots, a_n are nilpotent elements, i.e., satisfy a_i^N =0 for some N. In particular, if R is a domain (has no zero divisors), then the units of R[x] agree with the ones of R. The units of the power series ring Rx are precisely those power series :p(x)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty a_i x^i such that a_0 is a unit in R. =Matrix rings= The unit group of the ring of matrices over a commutative ring (for example, a field) is the group of invertible matrices. An element of the matrix ring \\\\operatorname{M}_n(R) is invertible if and only if the determinant of the element is invertible in R, with the inverse explicitly given by Cramer's rule. =In general= Let R be a ring. For any x, y in R, if 1 - xy is invertible, then 1 - yx is invertible with the inverse 1 + y(1-xy)^{-1}x. The formula for the inverse can be found as follows: thinking formally, suppose 1-yx is invertible and that the inverse is given by a geometric series: (1-yx)^{-1} = \\\\sum_0^{\\\\infty} (yx)^n. Then, manipulating it formally, :(1-yx)^{-1} = 1 + y \\\\left(\\\\sum_0^{\\\\infty} (xy)^n \\\\right)x = 1 + y(1-xy)^{-1}x. See also Hua's identity for a similar type of results. Group of units The units of a ring form a group under multiplication, the group of units of . Other common notations for are , , and (from the German term ). A commutative ring is a local ring if is a maximal ideal. As it turns out, if is an ideal, then it is necessarily a maximal ideal and R is local since a maximal ideal is disjoint from . If is a finite field, then is a cyclic group of order R - 1. The formulation of the group of units defines a functor from the category of rings to the category of groups: every ring homomorphism induces a group homomorphism , since maps units to units. This functor has a left adjoint which is the integral group ring construction. Associatedness In a commutative unital ring , the group of units acts on via multiplication. The orbits of this action are called sets of '; in other words, there is an equivalence relation ‚àº on called associatedness such that : means that there is a unit with . In an integral domain the cardinality of an equivalence class of associates is the same as that of .

He was a monk and Metropolitan bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church. He was founder and for many years bishop - then archbishop, then metropolitan - of the Diocese of Sourozh, the Patriarchate of Moscow's diocese for Great Britain and Ireland (the name 'Sourozh' is that of the historical episcopal see in Sudak in the Crimea). As a bishop he became well known as a pastor, preacher, spiritual director and writer on prayer and the Christian life. Early life Andrei Bloom was born on 19 June 1914, in Lausanne, Switzerland, to Xenia and Boris Edvardovich Bloom. On his mother's side, he was the nephew of the composer Alexander Scriabin. He spent his early childhood in Russia and Iran. During the Russian Revolution the family had to leave Iran, and by 1923 they were settled in Paris, where he was educated. He graduated in physics, chemistry and biology, and took his doctorate in medicine at the University of Paris. By his own words, he met Christ, when he was a teenager: > \\"I met Christ as a Person at a moment when I needed him in order to live, > and at a moment when I was not in search of him. I was found; I did not find > him\\". \\"I was a teenager then. Life had been difficult in the early years and > now it had of a sudden become easier.

In 1943 he was tonsured and received the name of Antony. During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany he worked as a doctor, and took part in the French Resistance.Anthony Bloom, Beginning to Pray, page 6. After the war he continued practising as a physician until 1948, when he was ordained to the presbyterate and sent to Britain to serve as Orthodox Christian chaplain of the Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius, a society established to foster understanding and friendship between the Russian Orthodox and Anglican churches. In 1950 he was appointed vicar of the Russian Patriarchal parish in London. In 1957 he was consecrated as bishop, and as archbishop in 1962 in charge of the Russian Orthodox Church in Great Britain and Ireland. In 1963 he was appointed exarch of the Moscow Patriarchate in Western Europe, and in 1966 was assigned the rank of metropolitan bishop. In 1974 by mutual agreement he was released from the function of exarch, in order to devote himself more fully to the pastoral needs of the growing flock of his diocese. Between 1966 and 1986 he brought out six books on prayer. In mid 2003, Bloom resigned as diocesan bishop. He died on 4 August 2003. His grave in the Brompton Cemetery, London, is visited by Christians and many others. Honours Bloom received honorary doctorates from the University of Aberdeen ('for preaching the Word of God and renewing the spiritual life of this country'); from the Moscow Theological Academy for his theological, pastoral and preaching work; from the University of Cambridge; and from the Kiev Theological Academy.

He came to prominence as a member of drummer Art Blakey's band before establishing a long career as a bandleader and composer. Several of his compositions have become jazz standards, including \\"Mosaic\\", \\"Bolivia\\", \\"Holy Land\\", \\"Mode for Joe\\" and \\"Fantasy in D\\".William Yardley, \\"Cedar Walton, Pianist and Composer, Dies at 79\\", The New York Times, August 20, 2013. Early life Walton was born and grew up in Dallas, Texas.\\"Pianist-Composer Cedar Walton Dies at Age 79\\" , DownBeat, August 20, 2013. His mother Ruth was an aspiring concert pianist, and was Walton's initial teacher.John Fordham, \\"Cedar Walton obituary\\", Guardian, August 23, 2013. She also took him to jazz performances around Dallas. Walton cited Nat King Cole, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk and Art Tatum as his major influences on piano.Deardra Shuler, \\"Cedar Walton and Barry Harris to play Jazz at Lincoln Center\\" , New York Amsterdam News, June 20, 2013. He began emulating recordings of these artists from an early age. After briefly attending Dillard University in New Orleans, he went to the University of Denver as a composition major originally, but was encouraged to switch to a music education program targeted to set up a career in the local public school system. This switch later proved extremely useful since Walton learned to play and arrange for various instruments, a talent he would hone with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. Walton was tempted by the promise of New York City through his associations with John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Richie Powell, whom he met at various after-hours sessions around the city of Denver, Colorado. In 1955, he decided to leave school and drove with a friend to New York City. He quickly got recognition from Johnny Garry, who ran Birdland at that time. Later life and career Walton was drafted into the U.S. Army, and stationed in Germany, cutting short his rising status in the after-hours scene. While in the Army, he played with musicians Leo Wright, Don Ellis, and Eddie Harris. Upon his discharge after two years, Walton picked up where he left off, playing as a sideman with Kenny Dorham (on whose 1958 album This Is the Moment! Walton made his recording debut),\\"Cedar Walton\\" (obituary), The Telegraph, August 20, 2013. Joining the Jazztet, led by Benny Golson and Art Farmer, Walton played with this group from 1958 to 1961. In April 1959, he recorded an alternate take of \\"Giant Steps\\" with John Coltrane, though he did not solo. In the early 1960s, Walton joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers as a pianist-arranger for three years, on the same day as Freddie Hubbard. In this group, which also featured Wayne Shorter, he demonstrated a keen sense of arranging in originals such as \\"Ugetsu\\" and \\"Mosaic\\". He left the Messengers in 1964 and by the late 1960s was part of the house rhythm section at Prestige Records, where in addition to releasing his own recordings, he recorded with Sonny Criss, Pat Martino, Eric Kloss, and Charles McPherson. For a year, he served as Abbey Lincoln's accompanist, and recorded with Lee Morgan from 1966 to 1968. During the mid-1970s, he led the funk group Mobius. Walton arranged and recorded for Etta James from the mid 1990s helping her to win a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album for Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday (RCA Victor) in 1994.Appelbaum, L., Before and After: Cedar Walton, JazzTimes, November 5, 2004 Many of Walton's compositions have been adopted as jazz standards, including \\"Firm Roots\\", \\"Bolivia\\", \\"Holy Land\\", \\"Mode for Joe\\" and \\"Cedar's Blues\\". \\"Bolivia\\" is perhaps his best-known composition, while one of his oldest is \\"Fantasy in D\\", recorded under the title \\"Ugetsu\\" by Art Blakey in 1963,Bailey, Phil (1985), Volume 35 - Cedar Walton, Jamey Aebersold, 1985. and as \\"Polar AC\\" by Freddie Hubbard, first in 1971. In January 2010, Walton was inducted as a member of the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters.Lifetime Honors, National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters. After a brief illness, Walton died on August 19, 2013, at his home in Brooklyn, New York, at the age of 79.Mark Memmott, \\"Jazz Pianist Cedar Walton Dies\\", NPR, August 19, 2013. Billy Higgins Partnership and \\"The Magic Triangle\\" Walton played and recorded with drummer Billy Higgins from the mid-1960s through the 1990s. Higgins and Walton first recorded together in 1965 for Eddie Harris's The In Sound LP, and Higgins played drums on Walton's first album, the 1967 recording Cedar!. Walton and Higgins went on to play and record together regularly throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s, bassist Sam Jones formed a working trio with Walton and Higgins that the group members called The Magic Triangle. The trio recorded albums under the leadership of both Walton and Jones, and were backing musicians on several 1970s albums by Art Farmer and Clifford Jordan (including Jordan's Glass Bead Games and Farmer's Art Farmer Quintet at Boomers). Though Walton, Jones, and Higgins did not record under the name The Magic Triangle, Jordan's albums Clifford Jordan and the Magic Triangle on Stage, Firm Roots, and The Highest Mountain referenced the trio's informal name in the titles. The trio also backed up Hank Mobley, Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt, and Idrees Sulieman in the 1970s on live and studio recordings. Drummer Louis Hayes replaced Higgins in the trio on occasion during this period for recordings and live performances. In 1975, the Magic Triangle trio became the core of the Eastern Rebellion jazz collective, which featured (at different times) saxophonists George Coleman, Bob Berg and Ralph Moore, trombonist Curtis Fuller, and trumpeter Alfredo \\"Chocolate\\" Armenteros. Eastern Rebellion released seven albums between 1975 and 1994, all featuring Walton and Higgins. Sam Jones died in late 1981, and Walton and Higgins carried on as a trio with bassist David \\"Happy\\" Williams, who also joined the pair on the four final Eastern Rebellion recordings. The trio of Walton, Williams, and Higgins recorded regularly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s under Walton's leadership. During this time, Walton and Higgins also appeared together as backing musicians on recordings by Freddie Hubbard, Stanley Turrentine, Slide Hampton, Junior Cook, Bobby Hutcherson, Frank Morgan, and Jackie McLean (sometimes with other bassists in place of Williams). With bassist Ron Carter, Walton and Higgins recorded two live albums in 1991 at the Sweet Basil Jazz Club under the name The Sweet Basil Trio. A third Sweet Basil Trio record, this time with Williams playing bass, was recorded in 1993. Writing of The Magic Triangle's collaborations with Clifford Jordan, pianist and essayist Ethan Iverson wrote \\"Taken as a collection, the Jordan-Walton canon from the seventies is some of the best jazz ever recorded....If I had to pick only one from that collaboration for a desert isle, it would be Jordan‚Äôs Night of the Mark VII.\\" Discography =As leader/co-leader= *1967: Cedar!

The series was produced for Showtime and Showcase by Cowlip Productions, Tony Jonas Productions, Temple Street Productions, and Showtime Networks, in association with Crowe Entertainment. It was developed and written by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, who were the showrunners, and also the executive producers along with Tony Jonas, former President of Warner Bros. Television. Based on the British series of the same name created by Russell T Davies, Queer as Folk was the first hour-long drama on American television to portray the lives of homosexual men and women. Although it was set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, much of the series was actually shot in Toronto and employed various Canadian directors known for their independent film work (including Bruce McDonald, David Wellington, Kelly Makin, John Greyson, Jeremy Podeswa and Michael DeCarlo), as well as Australian director Russell Mulcahy, who directed the pilot episode. Additional writers in the later seasons included Michael MacLennan, Efrem Seeger, Brad Fraser, Del Shores, and Shawn Postoff. Show premise The series follows the lives of five gay men living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Brian (Gale Harold), Justin (Randy Harrison), Michael (Hal Sparks), Emmett (Peter Paige), and Ted (Scott Lowell); a lesbian couple, Lindsay (Thea Gill) and Melanie (Michelle Clunie); and Michael's mother Debbie (Sharon Gless) and his uncle Vic (Jack Wetherall). Another main character, Ben (Robert Gant), was added in the second season. Cast and characters =Main= * Gale Harold as Brian Kinney (UK version: Aidan Gillen as Stuart Alan Jones) : Brian Kinney: a veritable sex-machine. At 29 years old, he is living life for the now. He is his own man and believes in having sex for the sheer joy of doing it. While he and Justin have an on-and-off-again relationship, Justin is the only one of his sexual encounters that Brian finds himself falling in love with and the only one he continues to have sex with after the first night. : He makes his living as an advertising executive for Vangard, and later on builds his own company, Kinnetik, which was named by Justin. While he purports himself as not part of the gay and lesbian community, he will do what he can to protect his fellow gay man or woman. His motto when it comes to straight people: \\"There are two kinds of straight people in the world, those that hate you to your face and those who hate you behind your back.\\" * Randy Harrison as Justin Taylor (UK version: Charlie Hunnam as Nathan Maloney) : Justin loses his virginity to Brian at the age of seventeen and falls in love with him. He runs away from home after coming out of the closet, primarily because his father is not accepting of his sexuality. Nicknamed \\"Sunshine\\" by Debbie because of his bright smile and cheery disposition, Justin is queer-bashed at the end of Season 1, resulting in Brian taking him in during Season 2. A talented artist, Justin briefly contemplates attending business school to appease his father but ultimately decides to attend art school to become a visual artist. He and Brian further their relationship over the five seasons eventually ending in a marriage proposal. Justin says yes, but Brian tells him to go to New York to pursue his art because he would be more successful there than he would be in Pittsburgh. * Hal Sparks as Michael Novotny (UK version: Craig Kelly as Vince Tyler) : Brian's best friend since adolescence, Michael secretly harbors feelings for him. He enjoys reading comic books, particularly Captain Astro adventures. He starts the series as a manager at a Kmart-like department store, the Big Q, but eventually follows his dream of opening a comic book store.

Justin gives him a handjob early in the series, but he is then revealed to be homophobic. After assaulting Justin with a baseball bat he is charged with assault and battery and sentenced to community service and probation. He is later shown working in construction and does not express remorse for his actions until Justin, at Cody's urging, forces him at gunpoint to apologize. Justin plays into Chris's homophobia by claiming that Chris will not report them to the police for fear that people would know he was almost killed by \\"a couple of sissy fags\\". * Stephanie Moore as Cynthia (UK version: Alison Burrows as Sandra Docherty) : Brian's assistant. Quits Vangard to follow Brian when he starts his own firm, Kinnetic.

Afterwards, Loretta and Deb become friends but things go awry when Loretta kisses Deb while they are out for drinks. Deb eventually lets Loretta down gently and Loretta decides to leave town, saying that she loves Deb too much to be anywhere near her. Plot The first episode finds the four friends ending a night at Babylon, a popular gay club. Brian picks up and has sex with Justin, who falls in love with him and eventually becomes more than a one-night stand. Brian also becomes a father that night, bearing a son with Lindsay through artificial insemination. Michael's seemingly unrequited love for Brian fuels the story, which he occasionally narrates in voice-over. Justin's coming out and the budding relationship with Brian has unexpected effects on Brian and Michael's lives much to Michael's dismay as Justin is only 17 years old. Justin confides in his straight high-school friend Daphne, while struggling to deal with homophobic classmates and his dismayed, divorcing parents, Craig and Jennifer. Later in the second season, Justin and Michael co-create the sexually explicit underground comic Rage, featuring a \\"Gay Crusader\\" superhero based on Brian. Brian's son Gus, being raised by Lindsay and Melanie, becomes the focus of several episodes as issues of parental rights come to the fore. Ted is Melanie's accountant who once harbored a longstanding crush on Michael. He and Emmett begin as best friends, but briefly become lovers later in the series. Their relationship ends as Ted, unemployed and with a criminal record earned from running a legitimate porn website that was targeted by a Chief of Police running for Mayor, becomes addicted to crystal meth. In the fourth season, Brian, who has lost his job by assisting Justin in opposing an anti-gay political client, starts his own agency. He also discovers he has testicular cancer and hides his treatment from his friends. Michael marries Ben Bruckner, an HIV-positive college professor, and the couple adopts a teenage son, James \\"Hunter\\" Montgomery, who is also HIV-positive as a result of his experiences as a young hustler. Ted's affair with a handsome crystal meth addict, Blake Wyzecki, sets the pattern for Ted's later tragic but ultimately redeeming experiences with drug addiction. Melanie and Lindsay's relationship, while on the surface seeming more of a \\"stable\\" relationship, is actually quite tumultuous. Each cheats on the other at various points in the series; both tackle on a threesome shortly after they marry and become separated for much of the 4th and 5th seasons. Melanie is impregnated by Michael (through artificial insemination, as Lindsay was) in the third season, so that best friends Brian and Michael become co- fathers to Lindsay and Melanie's children. Melanie gives birth to a girl, Jenny Rebecca, over whom Melanie, Lindsay, and Michael have a brief legal custody battle following the women's transitory break-up. Brian's new advertising agency, Kinnetik, becomes highly successful both through a combination of Brian's customer loyalty and his edgier advertising. As a result of this, Brian is able to purchase Club Babylon from its bankrupt owner. In the fifth and final season the boys have become men, and the series, perhaps more comfortable in its role in gay entertainment, tackles political issues head-on and with much more fervor. A political campaign called \\"Proposition 14\\" is depicted during much of the final season as a looming threat to the main characters. This proposition, like so many real-life recent legislative moves that have affected many U.S. states, threatens to outlaw same-sex marriage, adoption and other family civil rights. The many ways in which such a proposition would affect the characters are depicted through nearly every episode. Debbie, Justin, Jennifer, Daphne, Emmett, Ted, Michael, Ben, Lindsay, Melanie, and the children are depicted standing up and fighting against this proposition both by active canvassing, political contributions, and other democratic processes, but are met with staunch opposition, discrimination, outright hatred, and political setbacks. The show climaxes near the end of the series when a benefit to support opposition to Proposition 14 hosted at Brian's club Babylon (after repeated relocations of the benefit, due to discrimination) is attacked by a bomb that initially kills 4, and eventually another 3 and injures 67. This horrible event sets the bittersweet tone for the final three episodes, in which Brian, frightened by this third possible loss of Justin, finally declares his love for him. The two even plan to marry, but Justin's artistic abilities get noticed by a New York art critic and the two decide, for the time being at least, in favor of a more realistic approach to a stormy relationship that nevertheless works for their characters. Melanie and Lindsay, realizing they have more in common than they don't, resume their relationship but relocate to Canada to \\"raise [their children] in an environment where they will not be called names, singled out for discrimination, or ever have to fear for their life.\\" Emmett becomes a Queer-Eye type TV presenter but is later fired when professional football player Drew Boyd kisses him on the news to signify his coming out. Ted confronts his midlife crisis head-on and finally reunites with Blake. Hunter returns and the Novotny-Bruckner family perseveres. The series came full circle with the final scenes staged in the restored Babylon nightclub. In the final scene, Brian dances to Heather Small's \\"Proud,\\" a song that accompanied a pivotal scene between Brian and Michael in the very first episode of the series. It ends with a final narration by Michael: Cultural implications The American version of Queer as Folk quickly became the number one show on the Showtime roster. The network's initial marketing of the show was primarily targeted at gay male (and to some extent, lesbian) audiences, yet a sizeable segment of the viewership turned out to be heterosexual women. Groundbreaking scenes abounded in Queer as Folk, beginning with the first episode, containing the first simulated sex scene between two men shown on American television (including mutual masturbation, anal sex, and rimming), albeit more tame than the scene it was based on in the UK version. Despite the frank portrayals of drug use and casual sex in the gay club scene, the expected right-wing uproar, besides some token opposition, never materialized. Cowen and Lipman, however, admitted in 2015 that they were surprised by a backlash from some quarters of the LGBT community, fearing negative implications that may result from the show. Controversial storylines which have been explored in Queer as Folk have included the following: coming out, same-sex marriage, ex-gay ministries, recreational drug use and abuse (cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, cannabis); gay adoption, artificial insemination, vigilantism, Autoerotic asphyxiation, gay-bashing, safe sex, HIV/AIDS, casual sex, cruising, \\"the baths,\\" serodiscordancy in relationships, underage prostitution, actively gay Catholic priests, discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation, the internet pornography industry, and bug chasers (HIV-negative individuals who actively seek to become HIV-positive). The series, at times, made humorous reference to its image in the gay community. A few episodes featured the show-within-a-show Gay as Blazes, a cheesy, dull, badly acted, and abundantly politically correct drama which Brian particularly disagreed with, and which was eventually canceled. =Cultural implications in the Asian context= Acting as one of the pioneering dramas depicting gay characters from a complex perspective, alternative media and platforms within Asia had also adopted the drama. In the case of South Korea itself, the Queer film festivals (first labeled as a \\"scandal\\" in 1998) was slowly accepted and even popularised across the South Korean society - Queer as Folk played a significant role when it was screened during the festival in 2000, providing a narrative for an alternative lifestyle especially with respect to the LGBT community. =Cast's real-life sexual orientation= The actors' real-life sexual orientation has been the subject of speculation from the public. In a 2015 Queer as Folk reunion, actors Gale Harold and Scott Lowell said they refused to discuss their own sexuality in the press, at least during the show's first season, in an effort to lessen distractions, which was corroborated by Lipman, who went on to say that during the show's first season, even he did not know their real-life sexuality. In an interview on CNN's Larry King Live on April 24, 2002, show host Larry King described Randy Harrison: \\"And Randy is the only other actual gay person in the show.\\" and Peter Paige as gay,: \\"We begin with, here in Los Angeles, Peter Paige. He plays Emmett Honeycutt. And he's out as a gay man in real life.\\" and Michelle Clunie,: \\"Two straight ladies here in Los Angeles; Tea Gill, who plays Lindsey Patterson, a university professor in a committed lesbian relationship and Michelle Clooney who plays Melanie Marcus. Melanie is a tough lawyer in that committed lesbian relationship.\\" Robert Gant,: \\"In New York is Robert Gant, he plays Ben Bruchner. Ben was not part of the first season. He is a professor of gay studies, also is HIV positive, also is straight.\\" Thea Gill, Gale Harold,: \\"In New York, Gale Harold, who is also straight.\\" Scott Lowell,: \\"Let's meet our next panes, here in Los Angeles Scott Lowell plays Ted Schmidt. Ted is a gay, low key, down to earth accountant. And by the way, he's also a straight man.\\" and Hal Sparks: \\" Hal, as a straight actor, why did you take the role of a gay person?\\" as straight. Three months after the interview on Larry King Live, Gant came out as gay in an article on The Advocate. In 2004, Gill, married to director Brian Richmond at the time, came out as a bisexual in an interview with Windy City Times. Meanwhile, Sharon Gless's life as a woman married to a man was already well known by the time Queer as Folk was in production, having married Barney Rosenzweig in 1991. She has been described as a straight woman. In the years since Queer as Folk ended, Harold, Harrison, Lowell, Paige and Sparks have openly discussed their sexual orientation in gay publications.  Setting  The series was set in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which it depicted with a good deal of creative license; one example is the numerous references made to the Susquehanna River which flows in the eastern and central parts of Pennsylvania whereas Pittsburgh is in the west. Pittsburgh was chosen as the closest parallel to the UK series' industrial setting of Manchester, England. However, since Pittsburgh does not have a large gay district like San Francisco or New York City, almost all of the Liberty Avenue scenes were filmed in and around the Church and Wellesley area of Toronto which is that city's gay village. In fact, not a single shot of the real Liberty Avenue was ever used in the series. Toronto was chosen as the production center of the series because of its lower cost of production and established mature television and film industry. And, as it happens, Toronto's gay village had the look the producers needed to bring their vision of Liberty Avenue alive. Woody's, the central bar in this fantasy Pittsburgh, is the name of a leading gay bar in Toronto, whose real exterior was shot with only minor disguise. (In a Season 4 episode in which several characters traveled to Toronto, the real Woody's was dubbed \\"Moosie's\\".) Babylon was also the name of a real gay bar in Toronto, which was open during the show's run but subsequently closed, although the real establishment was a sitdown martini bar;\\"Bar Babylon closed, owner arrested\\" .

The term usually encompasses the historic counties of (from west to east) Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, and Somerset, and is often extended to include Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, in the South West region. Some definitions also include Herefordshire. The West Country is host to distinctive regional English dialects and accents as well as to the Cornish language. Extent The West Country is bounded by the English Channel in the south and (perhaps partly) by the Bristol Channel in the north. However the West Country's eastern limit is not precisely defined, as different definitions are used. Some definitions are roughly synonymous with South West England, while others refer to only the southwestern part, or in a wider sense to include areas such as Herefordshire (in the West Midlands region). West Country Carnival events take place in Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire. ITV Westcountry is an ITV franchise covering the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall, Devon and areas of Dorset and Somerset.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport-supported website \\"Icons of England\\" defines the West Country as including Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire, and the former Avon area, but excluding Dorset (in \\"South England\\") and Gloucestershire (defined as part of the \\"West Midlands\\"). The \\"West Country\\" edition of the 2005 BBC TV series Seven Natural Wonders featured \\"wonders\\" in Somerset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, and Herefordshire (Symonds Yat), but not those in Cornwall or Devon which were the subject of a separate programme on the \\"South West\\", nor Dorset which was covered in a programme on \\"The South\\". The \\"West Country Clothing District\\" was an area that made woollen cloth. It covered east Somerset and parts of the counties of Wiltshire and Gloucestershire and at some periods extended into Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The clothing district around Tiverton and Exeter in Devon and west Somerset tended to make different kinds of cloth and is usually regarded as distinct.

It is served by itself (as a dip) or as a major ingredient in hummus, baba ghanoush, and halva. Tahini is used in the cuisines of the Levant and Eastern Mediterranean, the South Caucasus, as well as parts of North Africa.  Etymology  Tahini is a loanword from modern Greek tach√≠ni (), which is from the colloquial Levantine pronunciation of Arabic (), or more accurately (), whence also English tahina. It is derived from the root , which as a verb means \\"to grind\\", and also produces the word , \\"flour\\" in some dialects. The word tahini appeared in English by the late 1930s.Treasury decisions under customs and other laws, 1938, p. 1080 snippet  History  The oldest mention of sesame is in a cuneiform document written 4000 years ago that describes the custom of serving the gods sesame wine. The historian Herodotus writes about the cultivation of sesame 3500 years ago in the region of the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia. It was mainly used as a source of oil. Tahini is mentioned as an ingredient of hummus kasa, a recipe transcribed in an anonymous 13th-century Arabic cookbook, Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada. Sesame paste is an ingredient in some Chinese and Japanese dishes; Sichuan cuisine uses it in some recipes for dandan noodles. Sesame paste is also used in Indian cuisine.Sanjeev Kapoor, Khazana of Indian Vegetarian Recipes, p. 94 In the United States, sesame tahini, along with other raw nut butters, was available by 1940 in health food stores.Mariposa, Hollywood Glamour Cook Book, 1940, p. 101.  Preparation and storage  Tahini is made from sesame seeds that are soaked in water and then crushed to separate the bran from the kernels. The crushed seeds are soaked in salt water, causing the bran to sink. The floating kernels are skimmed off the surface, toasted, and ground to produce an oily paste. It can also be prepared with untoasted seeds and called \\"raw tahini\\", which is sometimes sold as an organic food product. Because of tahini's high oil content, some manufacturers recommend refrigeration to prevent spoilage. Others do not recommend refrigeration, as it makes the product more viscous and more difficult to serve.  Culinary uses  Hummus and ful topped with tahini Tahini-based sauces are common in Middle Eastern restaurants as a side dish or as a garnish, usually including lemon juice, salt, and garlic, and thinned with water. Hummus is made of cooked, mashed chickpeas typically blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and garlic. Tahini sauce is also a popular topping for meat and vegetables in Middle Eastern cuisine. A sweet spread, halawa ta·∏•ƒ´niyya ( \\"sweet tahini\\") is a type of halva sweet. It sometimes has mashed or sliced pistachio pieces sprinkled inside or on top. It is usually spread on bread and eaten as a quick snack. In Armenia, tahini can be used as a sauce to put on lahmajoun. In Greece, tahini () is used as a spread on bread either alone or topped with honey or jam. Jars of tahini ready-mixed with honey or cocoa are available in the breakfast food aisles of Greek supermarkets. In Cyprus, tahini, locally known as tashi, is used as a dip for bread and in pitta souvlaki rather than tzatziki, which is customary in Greece. Tahini is called ardeh () in Persian. In Iran it is used to make halvardeh (), a kind of halva made of tahini, sugar, egg whites, and other ingredients. It is also eaten during breakfast, usually with an accompanying sweet substance, usually grape syrup, date syrup, honey, jams, etc. Ardeh and halvardeh are among the souvenirs of the Iranian cities of Yazd and Ardakan. In Turkey, tahini () is mixed with pekmez to make tahin-pekmez which is often served as a breakfast item or after meals as a sweet dip for breads. In Iraq, tahini is known as rashi, and is mixed with date syrup (rub) to make a sweet dessert usually eaten with bread. In Israel, tahini ( t'hina) is a staple foodstuff. It is served as a dip with flat bread or pita, a topping for many foods such as falafel, sabich, Jerusalem mixed grill and shawarma, and as an ingredient in various spreads. It is also used as a sauce for meat and fish, and in sweet desserts like halva, halva parfait,Rogov, Daniel, Halvah Parfait halva ice cream and tahini cookies. It is also served baked in the oven with kufta made of lamb or beef with spices and herbs, or with a whole fish in the coastal areas and the Sea of Galilee. In the Levant, tahini (Levantine Arabic: t'hine) is a staple foodstuff prepared with salt, lemon juice, and optionally mashed garlic. It is served as a dip with pita, or a topping for falafel and shawarma, and as an ingredient in various spreads. It is also used as a sauce for meat and fish. It is a main ingredient in a seafood dish called siyadiyeh. Tahini is used in sweet desserts like halva and halva with pistachios. In the Gaza Strip, a rust- colored variety known as \\"red tahina\\" is served in addition to ordinary tahina. It is achieved by a different and lengthier process of roasting the sesame seeds, and has a more intense taste. Red tahina is used in sumagiyya (lamb with chard and sumac) and salads native to the falaheen from the surrounding villages, as well as southern Gaza. In the West Bank city of Nablus, tahina is mixed with qizha paste to make \\"black tahina\\", used in baking. In East Asia, sesame paste () is a major condiment used with dry noodles (hot or cold). Sesame paste can also be eaten as a dessert, known as black sesame soup.  Nutritional information  Tahini is a source of calcium, manganese, potassium, and phosphorus. Tahini's relatively high levels of calcium and protein make it a useful addition to vegetarian and vegan diets, as well as to raw food diets when eaten in its unroasted form.

Geibel in 1869. They weave sheet webs that have a funnel shelter on one edge. The web is not sticky, but these spiders make up for that shortcoming by running very rapidly. The larger specimens (depending on species) can grow to about 19 mm in body length. They may be recognized by the arrangement of their eight eyes into three rows. The top row has two eyes, the middle row has four eyes, and the bottom row has two eyes (spaced wider than the ones on the top row). They have two prominent hind spinnerets, somewhat indistinct bands on their legs, and two dark bands running down either side of the cephalothorax. Agelenopsis aperta, the American funnel-web spider, produces agatoxins. Their bite causes rapid paralysis in insect prey, though their venom is not medically significant to humans. Name The genus name is a combination of Agelena (Eurasian grass spiders), a genus of similar spiders, and Greek -opsis \\"to look like\\". They are harmless spiders, or so Kerem thinks. Although most spiders use their webs to catch prey, the grass spider's web lacks adhesive ability. The spiders make up for that with their fast running. The main distinction between Agelenopsis and the related European genus Agelena consists of the pattern appearing on the cephalothorax; the former possesses two awais-quasiparallel lines from the eyes to the beginning of the abdomen. The latter genus has curved, irregular lines that often meet at the end. Another difference is the length of the front legs row in females, but in males, the comparison is too inconsiderable.

It lies south of the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and the Austria‚ÄìGermany border runs over its western summit. South of the mountain is the Zugspitzplatt, a high karst plateau with numerous caves. On the flanks of the Zugspitze are three glaciers, including the two largest in Germany: the Northern Schneeferner with an area of 30.7 hectares and the H√∂llentalferner with an area of 24.7 hectares. The third is the Southern Schneeferner which covers 8.4 hectares. The Zugspitze was first climbed on 27 August 1820 by Josef Naus, his survey assistant, Maier, and mountain guide, Johann Georg Tauschl. Today there are three normal routes to the summit: one from the H√∂llental valley to the northeast; another out of the Reintal valley to the southeast; and the third from the west over the Austrian Cirque (√ñsterreichische Schneekar). One of the best known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps runs along the knife-edged Jubilee Ridge (Jubil√§umsgrat) to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the Hochblassen and the Alpspitze. For mountaineers there is plenty of nearby accommodation. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the M√ºnchner Haus and on the western slopes is the Wiener- Neust√§dter Hut. Three cable cars run to the top of the Zugspitze. The first, the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car, was built in 1926 by the German company Adolf Bleichert & Co Peter von Bleichert \\"Bleichert's Wire Ropeways\\" and terminated on an ar√™te below the summit at 2,805 m.a.s.l, the so-called Kammstation, before the terminus was moved to the actual summit at 2,951 m.a.s.l. in 1991. A rack railway, the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway, runs inside the northern flank of the mountain and ends on the Zugspitzplatt, from where a second cable car takes passengers to the top. The rack railway and the Eibsee Cable Car, the third cableway, transport an average of 500,000 people to the summit each year. In winter, nine ski lifts cover the ski area on the Zugspitzplatt. The weather station, opened in 1900, and the research station in the Schneefernerhaus are mainly used to conduct climate research.  Geography  The Zugspitze belongs to the Wetterstein range of the Northern Limestone Alps. The Austria‚ÄìGermany border goes right over the mountain. There used to be a border checkpoint at the summit but, since Germany and Austria are now both part of the Schengen zone, the border crossing is no longer manned. The exact height of the Zugspitze was a matter of debate for quite a while. Given figures ranged from , but it is now generally accepted that the peak is above sea level as a result of a survey carried out by the Bavarian State Survey Office. The lounge at the new caf√© is named \\"2962\\" for this reason. = Location = View from the Alpspitze of the Zugspitze summit and the H√∂llentalferner glacier in 2007 At (eastern peak) the Zugspitze is the highest mountain of the Zugspitze massif. This height is referenced to the Amsterdam Gauge and is given by the Bavarian State Office for Survey and Geoinformation. The same height is recorded against the Trieste Gauge used in Austria, which is 27 cm lower. Originally the Zugspitze had three peaks: the east, middle and west summits (Ost-, Mittel- and Westgipfel). The only one that has remained in its original form is the east summit, which is also the only one that lies entirely on German territory. The middle summit fell victim to one of the cable car summit stations in 1930. In 1938 the west summit was blown up to create a building site for a planned flight control room for the Wehrmacht. This was never built however. Originally the height of the west summit was given as .Hiebeler (1985), p. 25. The mountain rises eleven kilometres southwest of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and just under six kilometres east of Ehrwald. The border between Germany and Austria runs over the west summit; thus the Zugspitze massif belongs to the German state of Bavaria and the Austrian state of Tyrol. The municipalities responsible for it are Grainau and Ehrwald. To the west the Zugspitze massif drops into the valley of the River Loisach, which flows around the massif towards the northeast in a curve whilst, in the east, the streams of Hammersbach and Partnach have their source. To the south the Gaistal valley and its river, the Leutascher Ache, separate the Wetterstein Mountains from the Mieming Chain. To the north at the foot of the Zugspitze is the lake of Eibsee. The next highest mountain in the area is the Acherkogel () in the Stubai Alps, which gives the Zugspitze a topographic isolation value of 24.6 kilometres. The reference point for the prominence is the Parseierspitze (). In order to climb it from the Zugspitze, a descent to the Fern Pass () is required, so that the prominence is . ;Zugspitze Massif Annotated aerial photograph of the Zugspitze massif The massif of the Zugspitze has several other peaks. To the south the Zugspitzplatt is surrounded in an arc by the Zugspitzeck () and Schneefernerkopf (), the Wetterspitzen (), the Wetterwandeck (), the Plattspitzen () and the Gatterlk√∂pfen (). The massif ends in the Gatterl (), a wind gap between it and the Hochwanner. Running eastwards away from the Zugspitze is the famous Jubilee Ridge or Jubil√§umsgrat over the H√∂llentalspitzen towards the Alpspitze and Hochblassen. The short crest of the Riffelwandkamm runs northeast over the summits of the Riffelwandspitzen () and the Riffelk√∂pfe (), to the Riffel wind gap (Riffelscharte, ). From here the ridge of the Waxensteinkamm stretches away over the Riffelspitzen to the Waxenstein.Alpine Club Map 4/2 ‚Äì Wetterstein und Mieminger Gebirge Mitte (1:25,000). 5th edition. Alpenvereinsverlag, Munich, 2007. ;Zugspitzplatt The Zugspitzplatt above the Reintal valley in 2006 The Platt or Zugspitzplatt is a plateau below the summit of the Zugspitze to the south and southeast which lies at a height of between . It forms the head of the Reintal valley and has been shaped by a combination of weathering, karstification and glaciation. The area contains roches moutonn√©es, dolines and limestone pavements as a consequence of the ice ages. In addition moraines have been left behind by various glacial periods. The Platt was completely covered by a glacier for the last time at the beginning of the 19th century. Today 52% of it consists of scree, 32% of bedrock and 16% of vegetation-covered soils, especially in the middle and lower areas. = Climate = The climate is tundra (K√∂ppen: ET), maintaining the only glacier present in Germany, which has observed its reduction over the years. From a climatic perspective the Zugspitze lies in the temperate zone and its prevailing winds are Westerlies. As the first high orographic obstacle to these Westerlies in the Alps, the Zugspitze is particularly exposed to the weather. It is effectively the north barrier of the Alps (Nordstau der Alpen), against which moist air masses pile up and release heavy precipitation. At the same time the Zugspitze acts as a protective barrier for the Alpine ranges to the south. By contrast, F√∂hn weather conditions push in the other direction against the massif, affecting the region for about 60 days per year. These warm, dry air masses stream from south to north and can result in unusually high temperatures in winter. Nevertheless, frost dominates the picture on the Zugspitze with an average of 310 days per year. Climatic diagram for the Zugspitze: normal periods 1961‚Äì1990 For the decades from 1961 to 1990 ‚Äì designated by the World Meteorological Organization as the \\"normal period\\" ‚Äì the average annual precipitation on the Zugspitze was 2,003.1 mm; the wettest month being April with 199 mm, and the driest, October with 108.8 mm. By comparison the values for 2009 were 2,070.8 mm, the wettest month being March with 326.2 mm and the driest, January, with 56.4 mm. The average temperature in the normal period was ‚àí4.8 Celsius, with July and August being the warmest at 2.2 ¬∞C and February, the coldest, with ‚àí11.4 ¬∞C. By comparison the average temperature in 2009 was ‚àí4.2 ¬∞C, the warmest month was August at 5.3 ¬∞C and the coldest was February at ‚àí13.5 ¬∞C. The average sunshine during the normal period was 1,846.3 hours per year, the sunniest month being October with 188.8 hours and the darkest being December with 116.1 hours. In 2009 there were 1,836.3 hours of sunshine, the least occurring in February with just 95.4 hours and the most in April with 219 hours. In 2009, according to the weather survey by the German Met Office, the Zugspitze was the coldest place in Germany with a mean annual temperature of ‚àí4.2 ¬∞C.Mechthild Henneke: Wetterextreme in Deutschland 2009. In: S√ºdkurier dated 28 April 2010. The lowest measured temperature on the Zugspitze was ‚àí35.6 ¬∞C on 14 February 1940. The highest temperature occurred on 5 July 1957 when the thermometer reached 17.9 ¬∞C. A squall on 12 June 1985 registered 335 km/h, the highest measured wind speed on the Zugspitze. In April 1944 meteorologists recorded a snow depth of 8.3 metres.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 75ff. Nowadays, snow completely melts during summer, but in the past snow might resist the summer months, the last case when the snow failed to melt during the whole summer season was in 2000. = Geology = The north face of the Zugspitze seen from the Eibsee lake The geological strata composing the mountain are sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid down on the seabed. The base of the mountain comprises muschelkalk beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800 metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, ar√™tes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains lead and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the H√∂llental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from the foot of the Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder K√∂pfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze it can be seen that this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled on top of one another.Stephan Beulke: Alpenvereinsf√ºhrer Wetterstein. 4th edition. Bergverlag Rother, Munich 1996, p. 20ff, . = Flora = The flora on the Zugspitze is not particularly diverse due to the soil conditions, nevertheless the vegetation, especially in the meadows of Schachen, the Tieferen Wies near Ehrwald, and in the valleys of H√∂llental, Gaistal and Leutaschtal is especially colourful. The Eibsee in front of the Zugspitze: woods on the northern shore The shaded and moist northern slopes of the massif like, for example, the Wettersteinwald, are some of the most species-rich environments on the Zugspitze. The mountain pine grows at elevations of up to 1,800 metres. The woods lower down consist mainly of spruce and fir, but honeysuckle, woodruff, poisonous herb paris, meadow-rue and speedwell also occur here. Dark columbine, alpine clematis, blue and yellow monkshood, stemless carline thistle, false aster, golden cinquefoil, round-leaved saxifrage, wall hawkweed, alpine calamint and alpine forget-me- not flower in the less densely wooded places, whilst cinquefoil, sticky sage, butterbur, alpenrose, Turk's cap lily and fly orchid thrive on the rocky soils of the mountain forests. Lily of the valley and daphne also occur, especially in the H√∂llental, in Grainau and by the Eibsee.Pfanzelt (1966), p. 19 To the south the scene changes to larch (mainly in the meadow of Ehrwalder Alm and the valleys of Gaistal and Leutaschtal) and pine forests and into mixed woods of beech and sycamore. Here too, mountain pine grows at the higher elevations of over 2,000 metres. Relatively rare in the entire Zugspitze area are trees like the lime, birch, rowan, juniper and yew. The most varied species of moss, that often completely cover limestone rocks in the open, occur in great numbers. Bilberry, cranberry and cowberry are restricted to dry places and lady's slipper orchid occurs in sheltered spots. Below the Waxenstein are fields with raspberries and occasionally wild strawberries too. The alpine poppy and purple mountain saxifrage both thrive up to a very great height. On the scree slopes there are penny-cress and mouse-ear chickweed as well as mountain avens, alpine toadflax, mint and . Following snowmelt dark stonecrop and snow gentian are the first to appear, their seeds beginning to germinate as early as August. Other well-known alpine plants like edelweiss, gentians and, more rarely, cyclamen also flower on the Zugspitze. = Fauna = Alpine choughs on the Zugspitzeck The rocks around the Zugspitze are a habitat for chamois, whilst marmots are widespread on the southern side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently alpine choughs, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are mountain hare and the hazel dormouse. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the golden eagle, rock ptarmigan, snow finch, alpine accentor and brambling. The crag martin which has given its name to the Schwalbenwand (\\"Swallows' Wall\\") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes. The viviparous lizard inhabits rocky terrain, as does the black alpine salamander known locally as the Bergmandl, which can be seen after rain showers as one is climbing. Butterflies like Apollo, Thor's fritillary, gossamer-winged butterfly, geometer moth, ringlet and skipper may be seen on the west and south sides of the Zugspitze massif, especially in July and August.Pfanzelt (1966), p. 22 The woods around the Zugspitze are home to red deer, red squirrel, weasel, capercaillie, hazel grouse and black grouse. On the glaciers live glacier fleas (Desoria saltans) and water bears.Schott (1987), p. 116ff. = Glaciers = Three of Germany's five glaciers are found on the Zugspitze massif: the H√∂llentalferner the Southern and Northern Schneeferner. ;H√∂llentalferner The H√∂llentalferner in 2009 The H√∂llentalferner lies northeast of the Zugspitze in a cirque below the Jubilee Ridge (Jubil√§umsgrat) to the south and the Riffelwandspitzen peaks to the west and north. It has a northeast aspect. Its accumulation zone is formed by a depression, in which large quantities of avalanche snow collect. To the south the Jubil√§umsgrat shields the glacier from direct sunshine. These conditions meant that the glacier only lost a relatively small area between 1981 and 2006. In recent times the H√∂llentalferner reached its greatest around 1820 with an area of 47 hectares. Thereafter its area reduced continually until the period between 1950 and 1981 when it grew again, by 3.1 hectares to 30.2 hectares. Since then the glacier has lost (as at 2006) an area of 5.5 hectares and now has an area of 24.7 hectares. In 2006 the glacier head was at 2,569 m and its lowest point at 2,203 metres. ;Schneeferner The Northern Schneeferner and winter sport infrastructure in 2009 Southwest of the Zugspitze, between the Zugspitzeck and Schneefernerkopf, is the Northern Schneeferner which has an eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 hectares (2006) it is the largest German glacier. Around 1820 the entire Zugspitzplatt was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (Plattgletscher) only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively constant area of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable terrain that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using piste tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend the skiing season. At the beginning of the 1990s, ski slope operators began to cover the Northern Schneeferner in summer with artificial sheets in order to protect it from sunshine. The Northern Schneeferner reached its last high point in 1979, when its area grew to 40.9 hectares. By 2006 it had shrunk to 30.7 hectares. The glacier head then lay at 2,789 m and the foot at 2,558 metres. The Southern Schneeferner is surrounded by the peaks of the Wetterspitzen and the Wetterwandeck. It is also a remnant of the once great Platt Glacier. Today, the Southern Schneeferner extends up as far as the ar√™te and therefore has no protection from direct sunshine. It has also been divided into two basins by a ridge of rock that has appeared as the snow has receded. It is a matter of debate whether the Southern Schneeferner should still be classified as a glacier. The Southern Schneeferner also reached its last high point in 1979, when it covered an area of 31.7 hectares. This had shrunk by 2006 to just 8.4 hectares however. The highest point of the glacier lies at an elevation of 2,665 metres and the lowest at 2,520 metres. = Caves = Below the Zugspitzplatt chemical weathering processes have created a large number of caves and ab√Æmes in the Wetterstein limestone. In the 1930s the number of caves was estimated at 300. By 1955 62 caves were known to exist and by 1960 another 47 had been discovered. The first cave explorations here took place in 1931. Other, largest exploratory expeditions took place in 1935 and 1936 as well as between 1955 and 1968. During one expedition, in 1958, the Finch Shaft (Finkenschacht) was discovered. It is 131 metres deep, 260 metres long and has a watercourse. There is a theory that this watercourse could be a link to the source of the River Partnach.According to this theory there is a lake underneath the Zugspitzplatt that feeds the Partnach. Calculations show that the Platt produces 350 litres of water per second; the source of the Partnach however delivers at least 500 (and possibly up to several thousand litres). The difference is put down to a cave lake that also supplies the Partnach.Schott (1987), p. 136ff.  Name  Surrounding area From the early 14th century, geographic names from the Wetterstein Mountains began to be recorded in treaties and on maps, and this trend intensified in the 15th century. In 1536 a border treaty dating to 1500 was refined in that its course was specified as running over a Schartten (\\"wind gap\\" or \\"col\\"). In the 17th century the reference to this landmark in the treaty was further clarified as \\"now known as the Zugsp√ºz\\" (jetzt Zugsp√ºz genant). The landmark referred to was a wind gap on the summit of the Zugspitze and is used time and again in other sources. During the Middle Ages Scharte was a common name for the Zugspitze. The Zugspitze was first mentioned by name in 1590. In a description of the border between the County of Werdenfels and Austria, it states that the same border runs \\"from the Zugspitz and over the Derle\\" (von dem Zugspitz und √ºber den Derle\\") and continues to a bridge over the River Loisach. Another border treaty in 1656 states: \\"The highest Wetterstein or Zugspitz\\" (\\"Der h√∂chste Wetterstain oder Zugspitz\\"). There is also a map dating to the second half of the 18th century that shows \\"the Reintal in the County of Werdenfels\\". It covers the Reintal valley from the Reintaler Hof to the Zugspitzplatt and shows prominent points in the surrounding area, details of tracks and roads and the use pasture use. This includes a track over the then much larger Schneeferner glacier to the summit region of the Zugspitze. However the map does not show any obvious route to the summit itself. The name of the Zugspitze is probably derived from its Zugbahnen or avalanche paths. In winter avalanches sweep down from the upper slopes of the massif into the valley and leave behind characteristic avalanche remnants in the shape of rocks and scree. Near the Eibsee lake there are several plots of land with the same root: Zug, Zuggasse, Zugstick, Zugm√∂sel or Zugwankel. Until the 19th century the name der Zugspitz (male gender) was commonplace. It was described as die Zugspitze (female gender) for the first time on a map printed in 1836.Hiebeler (1985), p. 252. The spelling Zugspitz is still used in the Bavarian dialect.  Summit cross  Summit cross on the Zugspitze Since 1851 there has been a summit cross on the top of Zugspitze. The driving force behind the erection of a cross on the summit was the priest, Christoph Ott. He was a keen meteorologist and whilst observing conditions from the Hoher Pei√üenberg mountain he saw the Zugspitze in the distance and was exercised by the fact that \\"the greatest prince of the Bavarian mountains raised its head into the blue air towards heaven, bare and unadorned, waiting for the moment when patriotic fervour and courageous determination would see that his head too was crowned with dignity.\\"Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 35. As a result, he organised an expedition from 11 to 13 August 1851 with the goal of erecting a summit cross on the Zugspitze. Twenty eight bearers were led through the gorge of the Partnachklamm and the Reintal valley under the direction of forester, Karl Kiendl, up to the Zugspitze. The undertaking, which cost 610 Gulden and 37 Kreuzer, was a success. As a result, a 28-piece, 14 foot high, gilded iron cross now stood on the West Summit. Ott himself did not climb the Zugspitze until 1854. After 37 years the cross had to be taken down after suffering numerous lightning strikes; its support brackets were also badly damaged. In the winter of 1881‚Äì1882 it was therefore brought down into the valley and repaired. On 25 August 1882 seven mountain guides and 15 bearers took the cross back to the top. Because an accommodation shed had been built on the West Summit, the team placed the cross on the East Summit. There it remained for about 111 years, until it was removed again on 18 August 1993. This time the damage was not only caused by the weather, but also by American soldiers who used the cross as target practice in 1945, at the end of the Second World War. Because the summit cross could no longer be repaired, a replica was made that was true to the original cross. After two months the rack railway carried the new cross on 12 October to the Zugspitzplatt, from where it was flown to the summit by helicopter. The new cross has a height of 4.88 metres.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 35ff. It was renovated and regilded in 2009 for 15,000 euros and, since 22 April 2009, has stood once again on the East Summit.  History  Aerial photograph of the summit The first recorded ascent to the summit was accomplished by a team of land surveyors on 27 August 1820. The team was led by Lieutenant Josef Naus, who was accompanied by two men named Maier and G. Deutschl. However, local people had conquered the peak over 50 years earlier, according to a 1770 map discovered by the Alpenverein. In 1854, the northern part of the Zugspitze was given to Bavaria as a present by Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary Franz Joseph I as a marriage present to his wife Princess Elisabeth (\\"Sissi\\"). Since then the Zugspitze is the highest mountain of Bavaria and later of Germany. On 7 January 1882 the first successful winter assault on the Zugspitze was accomplished by F. Kilger, H. and J. Zametzer and H. Schwaiger. Pilot, Frank Hailer, caused a stir on 19 March 1922, when he landed a plane with skids on the Schneeferner glacier. On 29 April 1927 Ernst Udet succeeded in taking off from the Schneeferner with a glider; he landed at Lermoos after a 25-minute flight. The glider had been disassembled into individual parts and transported up the Zugspitze by cable car. In the winter of 1931/32, a post office was set up on the Zugspitze by the German Imperial Post Office or Reichspost. It still exists today in the Sonnalpin restaurant and has the postal address: 82475 Zugspitze. In 1931, four years after the first glider flight, the first balloon took off from the Zugspitze In April 1933, the mountain was occupied by of 24 storm troopers, who hoisted a swastika flag on top the tower on the weather station. A month later, SA and SS deployed on the Schneeferner in the shape of a swastika. On 20 April 1945 the US Air Force dropped bombs on the Zugspitze that destroyed the valley station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway and the hotel on the ridge. After the war the Allies seized the railway and Schneefernerhaus. Alpspitze and Zugspitze from Mt. Wank Shortly after World War II the US military took over the Schneefernerhaus (as the hotel at the top was then called) for the exclusive use of US military and civilian employees. Room rates, including meals, were US$1 per day. Ski lessons were available, taught by Austrians and Germans, at a cost of US$0.25 per hour. In 1948, the German Federal Post Office (Deutsche Bundespost) began operating a microwave radio station at the summit. In September of that year, three artistes walked a steel tightrope stretched between the East and West Summits. Two members of the Traber family traversed the same route in 1953 on a tightrope on a motorcycle. Since 1953, an annual Gatterl Mass (Gatterlmesse) has been held on the Gatterl mountain to commemorate the four members of the Bavarian Border Police who died in an avalanche in 1952 as well as all those who have died on the Zugspitze. In 1962 a fire destroyed the ridge hotel by the mountain station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway. The 1976 Friuli earthquake was also felt particularly strongly on the Zugspitze: the duty meteorologist feared that the observation tower might collapse.Schott (1987), p. 200. In 1981 a chapel was founded on the Zugspitze, which was consecrated by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Joseph Ratzinger, in October on the feast of Visitation. On 25 March, an automated teller machine was installed at the summit station; it has since been removed. In 1995, a 450 square metre exhibition area was opened at the summit, in which artists present their work for six months, before the exhibition is changed. In 1995, the border between Germany and Austria at the summit was opened.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 116ff. Since 2000, the Zugspitze extreme mountain run has been held annually. In July 2008 there were repercussions in the media when, as the result of a sudden drop in temperature, two participants died of exhaustion and hypothermia At the end of August 2009 the Swiss, Freddy Nock, walked along a cable of the Zugspitze Glacier Cable Car from the Zugspitzplatt to the summit. He covered the 995-metre-long, up to 56% steep route (which had a height difference of 348 metres) unsecured in 50 minutes.  Alpinism  = First ascent = Josef Naus in 1824 by H. v. Aggenstein There are several theories about the first ascent of the Zugspitze. The chronological table on an 18th-century map describes the route \\"along the path to the Zugspitze\\" (\\"ybers blath uf Zugspitze\\")Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 9. and gives a realistic duration of 8.5 hours, so that it is reasonable to deduce that the summit had been climbed before 1820. The historian, Thomas Linder, believes that goatherds or hunters had at the very least penetrated to the area of the summit. It is also conceivable that smugglers used routes over the Zugspitze summit.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 10. As early as 1804 cartographic surveys had taken place in the area for the County of Werdenfels. There is speculation that, in the course of this work, the royal engineer and geographer, Alois von Coulon, had reached the summit. Since Coulon worked for the Topographical Bureau, it is unlikely that his ascent would not have been noted.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 16. The first recorded ascent of the Zugspitze was achieved on 27 August 1820 by Lieutenant Josef Naus and mountain guide, Johann Georg TauschlTauschl is often called Deuschl. Ritschel and Dauer have shown this to be an unexplained error. Hiebeler calls the diary entry Tauschl by Josef Naus a mistake. together with Naus' survey assistant and batman (servant), Maier. As early as 21 July Naus, an officer in the Bavarian Army,Bosls bayerische Biographie by Karl Bosl. Accessed on 9 Apr 2011. had asked about the route through the Reintal valley to the Northern Schneeferner. The lieutenant was taking part in a survey exercise by the Royal Bavarian Topographic Bureau (K√∂niglich Bairischen Topographischen Bureau) for the Atlas of Bavaria (Atlas von Bayern) in the Werdenfelser Land. On 26 August, the three of them climbed in a group together with Captain Jetze and Lieutenant Antlischek up to the shepherd's hut of Angerh√ºtte. On 27 August around 4 in the morning, Naus, Tauschl and Maier set off for the Zugspitzplatt and Zugspitze summit. From the Schneeferner glacier they attempted to reach the West Summit along the west ridge. Their first attempt failed, but a second was successful and they finally reached the West Summit around 11:45 am, where they left behind a bergstock and cloth to mark their success. A thunderstorm and snowfall forced them to climb down again quickly. On 28 August they returned to the shepherd's hut at about 3 in the morning. The mountain guide, Tauschl, was given payment of two gulden and 42 kreuzer.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 9ff. = Subsequent ascents = The Zugspitze in 1864 (oil by Max Wolfinger) In 1823, Simon Resch and the sheep Toni became the first to reach the East Summit. Simon Resch was also led the second ascent of the East Summit on 18 September 1834 with his son, Johann, and the mountain guide, Johann Barth. Because Resch's first ascent had been doubted, this time a fire was lit on the summit. On the 27th the summit was climbed for a third time by royal forester's assistants, Franz Oberst and Schwepfinger, along with Johann Barth. Oberst erected a flagpole on the summit with a Bavarian flag that was visible from the valley. The first ascent from Austria took place in August 1837. The surveyors, Joseph Feuerstein and Joseph Sonnweber, climbed to the West Summit from Ehrwald and left behind a signal pole with their initials on it. The West Summit was conquered for the third time on 10 September 1843 by the shepherd Peter Pfeifer. He was asked about the route by a group of eight climbers who later reached the summit at the behest of Bavaria's Crown Princess Marie. She had the route checked in preparation for her own ascent of the Zugspitze. On 22 September 1853, Karoline Pitzner became the first woman on the Zugspitze. The first crossing from the West to the East Summit was achieved in 1857 by Dr. H√§rtringer from Munich and mountain guide, Joseph Ostler. The Irish brother, Trench, and Englishman, Cluster, succeeded in climbing the West Summit on 8 July 1871 through the Austrian Cirque (√ñsterreichische Schneekar) under the guidance of brothers, Joseph and Joseph Sonnweber. The route through the H√∂llental valley to the Zugspitze was first used on 26 September 1876 by Franz Tillmetz and Franz Johannes with guides, Johann and Joseph Dengg. The first winter ascent of the West Summit took place on 7 Januar 1882; the climbers being Ferdinand Kilger, Heinrich Schwaiger, Josef and Heinrich Zametzer and Alois Zott. The Jubilee Ar√™te (Jubil√§umsgrat) was first crossed in its entirety on 2 September 1897 by Ferdinand Henning. The number of climbers on the Zugspitze rose sharply year on year. If the summit had been climbed 22 times in 1854, by 1899 it had received 1,600 ascents. Before the construction of a cable car in 1926 there had already been over 10,000 ascents.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 16ff. = Normal routes = ;Zugspitzplatt via the Reintal or Gatterl View from the Gatterl into the Reintal The easiest of the normal routes runs through the Reintal valley and is that followed during the first ascent. At the same time it is also the longest climb. Its start point is the ski stadium () at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The route runs through the gorge of the Partnachklamm and along the Partnach river to the Bock Hut (), where the Reintal begins. Above the Partnach, which has meanwhile sunk underground, the route runs up to the Reintalanger Hut (). From there the climb is relatively gentle to start with, but then becomes steeper. From the hut the track runs through the Brunntal up to the Knorr Hut (), which stands on the eastern rim of the Zugspitzplatt. Here it meets the alternative route from Ehrwald via the Gaistal and the Gatterl at the Reintal Way. The route now runs over the Zugspitzplatt towards the Northern Schneeferner. The protected section of the climb to the Zugspitze summit begins above the Sonn-Alpin restaurant at Point 2815. The route climbs through a height of 2,232 metres and the true duration is between eight and ten hours.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 113f. ;H√∂llental View from the H√∂llentalanger Hut towards the Zugspitze The ascent starts in Hammersbach () through the H√∂llental along the Hammersbach stream. The path runs through the H√∂llental Gorge (H√∂llentalklamm) and was built from 1902 to 1905. Twelve tunnels were driven in the rock of the 1,026 metre long gorge with a total length of 288 metres. Another 569 metres of path was dynamited into the rock in the shape of a half profile, whilst 120 metres was led over footbridges and 49 metres over scree. The construction costs came to a total of 57,000 gold marks. Each year around 60,000 people pass through the gorge. The gorge can also be circumnavigated over the Stangensteig path. After the gorge the route heads for the H√∂llentalanger Hut (), after which it crosses the H√∂llentalanger stream. Above that the Brett is crossed on steel pins fixed to a rock face. Crossing the Gr√ºnen Buckel the trail runs up to the H√∂llentalferner glacier. The glacier is mostly snow-free in summer so that crampons are required to cross it. Even more difficult is the randkluft because the ice retreats further and further from the rock as it melts. After the glacier there is a klettersteig to the summit of the Zugspitze. This route climbs through a height of , for which between seven and eight hours are needed. There is also the option of getting to the H√∂llental route on the Riffelsteig path from Eibsee. This path crosses the Riffelscharte wind gap and meets the route before the Brett.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 113. ;Austrian Cirque A third ascent runs across the Austrian Cirque or √ñsterreichische Schneekar. Starting point for this are the lake of Eibsee () or the village of Ehrwald (). The two trails merge above the cirque of Gamskar. Thereafter the route continues to the Wiener-Neust√§dter Hut () and through the √ñsterreichische Schneekar, at the end of which a klettersteig begins. During this section the route climbs through the Stopselzieher, a natural drainage cave. The route then joins the secured sections of the Reintal route. This ascent takes at least eight hours and climbs in height.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 114. = Jubilee Ridge (Jubil√§umsgrat) = Western section of the ar√™te: view from the Middle H√∂llentalspitze to the Zugspitze One of the best- known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps is the Jubilee Ridge, which runs eastwards from the Zugspitze to the Hochblassen () and crosses the Inner (), Middle () and Outer H√∂llentalspitze () as well as the Vollkarspitze (). Along the way the route branches off towards Grie√ükarscharte () and to the Alpspitze (). Between 1909 and 1915 the ridge was partially secured with wire cables by the German Alpine Club section at Munich. Originally the route was called the Jubilee Way (Jubil√§umsweg), but after a tragic rescue attempt in 1979 the rather erroneous and misleading term, which suggested it was just a normal trail, was replaced by the name Jubil√§umsgrat, a Grat being a sharp ridge.Schott (1987), p. 188. During the crossing, which is not a pure klettersteig, several unprotected sections have to be negotiated that roughly correspond to climbing grade III. The most difficult climbing section is a smooth gully (III-). In the area of the Vollkarspitze peak is a climbing section of difficulty (D). The difficulty of the roughly eight kilometre long climbing route is around I and II as well as B. Normally it can be crossed in one day during the summer. Between the Middle and Outer H√∂llentalspitze is the H√∂llengrat Hut (), a bothy where climbers can take refuge for the night. It is mainly used during winter crossing, when the tour is split into two stages. The approach route to the tour is also possible from the Knorr Hut via the Brunntalgrat ridge and joins the route in the area of the Inner H√∂llentalspitze. = Accommodation = The Wiener-Neust√§dter Hut in 2006 There are numerous mountain huts in the area of the Zugspitze. One base is the H√∂llentalanger Hut () in the H√∂llental valley with 88 mattress spaces. Accommodation in the Reintal is provided by the Reintalanger Hut () with 90 bedspaces and on the edge of the Zugspitzplatt by the Knorr Hut () with 108 bedspaces. The Knorr Hut was the first hut in the entire Wetterstein Mountains when it was built in 1855. All the huts are open from May to October depending on the weather. On the top of the Zugspitze are three more huts: the Wiener- Neust√§dter Hut, the M√ºnchner Haus and the Schneefernerhaus. ;Wiener-Neust√§dter Hut The first hut on the Zugspitze was the Wiener-Neust√§dter Hut (Wiener- Neust√§dter-H√ºtte, ) built in 1884. It acts as a base for the klettersteig through the √ñsterreichische Schneekar that was opened as far back as 1879. The hut is located on the western rim of the cirque and stand below the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car. It is operated by the Austrian Tourist Club and offers overnighting for up to 34 mountaineers in the period from July to October. The winter room is designed to take 14 people and has no cooking or heating facilities. ;M√ºnchner Haus M√ºnchner Haus in 2005 There has been an accommodation hut just underneath the west summit since 1883. At that time the Alpine Club section at Munich built a wooden hut with places for twelve people. Although further development of the summit for tourism was criticised, more and more members supported the construction of a larger hut. This eventually resulted in the building of the M√ºnchner Haus (). First, in 1896, a 200 square metre site was dynamited out of the rock. The new mountain hut was completed on 19 September 1897 at a cost of 36,615 gold marks. It was equipped with a 21 kilometre long telephone cable and a 5.5 kilometre long lightning conductor. In the years 1911 to 1914 the hut was extended and given its present appearance. It offer 30 beds for overnight stays and is open from May to October. An average of 2,000 people stay there each year, in addition to day visitors.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 89ff. ;Schneefernerhaus The Schneefernerhaus () was built in 1930 as the station of the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway. In June 1931 the attached hotel was opened. After the war, US Forces commandeered the house as a \\"recreation facility\\". It was not released until 1952 and was then renovated, opening in December that same year. On 15 May 1965 it was hit by a serious avalanche. The avalanche had been triggered above the house and swept over the sun terrace. Ten people lost their lives and 21 were seriously injured. At the end of the 1980s the station was moved and, in January 1992, the hotel and restaurant closed. Between 1993 and 1997 it was extensively converted into a research station, that opened in 1996. During the building work there was a fire in 1994 that completely destroyed the fifth floor and the roof space.Ritschel & Dauer (2007), p. 69ff.  Tourism  = Winter sports = Aerial photograph For those wishing to reach the summit under their own power, various hiking and ski trails can be followed to the top. Hiking to the top from the base takes between one and two days, or a few hours for the very fit. Food and lodging is available on some trails. In winter the Zugspitze is a popular skiing and snowboarding destination, with several slopes on both sides. The Zugspitzplatt is Germany's highest ski resort, and thus normally has sufficient snow throughout the winter. = Climbing = At the Zugspitze's summit is the M√ºnchner Haus, a mountain hut (Alpenh√ºtte), a facility built by the German Alpine Club (Deutscher Alpenverein). For more than a hundred years, the summit has also had a weather station, which nowadays also gathers data for the Global Atmosphere Watch. View from the Zugspitze platform looking toward Austria Climbing up the Zugspitze can involve several routes. The large difference in elevation between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the summit is , making the climb a challenge even for trained mountaineers. On the German side, from Garmisch- Partenkirchen, climbers go either through the H√∂llental (\\"Valley of Hell\\") or the Reintal. The way through the Reintal is the easiest, but also the longest and takes 8 to 10 hours. This path goes through the Partnachklamm, a scenic gorge, then through the Reintal up to the Zugspitzplatt, a barren plateau. from there up to the summit. Climbers can stay for the night at two alpine huts, the \\"Reintalangerh√ºtte\\" or the \\"Knorrh√ºtte\\". The more popular, but harder route is through the H√∂llental. It starts at Hammersbach near Garmisch, goes through the H√∂llentalklamm, a similar gorge up to the \\"H√∂llentalangerh√ºtte\\", where one can take a meal or stay for the night. It then crosses the H√∂llentalferner, the remnants of a small glacier. After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps. Klettersteig equipment is recommended for that part. Over the Irmerscharte (a gap) it reaches the summit. This path will take 7 to 8 hours. From the Austrian village of Ehrwald, there are also two variants. One goes straight through the Western Flank, which is the shortest route overall, but rather hard. It includes a via ferrata, and there is a hut called \\"Wiener Neust√§dter H√ºtte\\" by the Austrian Alpine Club. An easier path leads via the Ehrwalder Alm, across a small pass called \\"Gatterl\\", joining the Reintal path at the Knorrh√ºtte. View from the Zugspitze platform looking north toward Germany.

From there, New York State Route 284 (NY 284) continues north to U.S. Route 6 (US 6) at Slate Hill. The route is a connector to Unionville, and intersects with an old alignment of its original designation, Route 84. Route 284 was first a part of Route 8 in the 1920s, becoming Route 8N in 1927 and Route 84 in 1942 before being assigned its current number in 1966.  Route description  View north at the south end of Route 284 at Route 23 in Sussex Route 284 begins at a signaled intersection in Sussex with Route 23. The route proceeds northward, intersecting with Sussex County Route 643 at less than a half-mile into the highway. Route 284 leaves the borough of Sussex and enters Wantage Township, intersecting with Layton Road, Janice Drive, and Possum River Road. Route 284 passes to the south of a lake, crosses over a branch of the Wallkill River and intersects with County Route 642 (Bassets Bridge Road). Just after the intersection with Route 642, the rural highway crosses over Quarryville Brook. At , Route 284 intersects with an old routing of its original designation, Route 84\\\\. The original alignment merges in with Route 284 less than a mile later. After crossing the Wallkill River branch again and the Appalachian Trail, Route 284 leaves New Jersey for New York and becomes NY 284. History Signage for the remains of Route 84 Route 8, one of the routes assigned before the 1927 renumbering, ran largely along the present Route 23 corridor, but at Sussex it turned north rather than continuing northwest through High Point State Park. The section from Sussex north to the state line was taken over by the state in 1919. In the 1927 renumbering, the majority of Route 8 became Route 23. The part north of Sussex was proposed to become part of Route 31, but that was instead moved to the present Route 94 corridor in the final version of the bill. As Route 8 north of Sussex was not assigned a number, the State Highway Commission appended a suffix of N (to distinguish it from new Route 8), forming Route 8N. The connecting route in New York had been numbered New York State Route 8 to match New Jersey, but in the 1930 renumbering it became New York State Route 84, in order to free up the number 8 for a longer route. New Jersey renumbered its Route 8N to Route 84 in March 1942 to match, in part to provide a single number for military caravans during World War II.Road Numbers Changed, The New York Times, March 20, 1942 The final renumbering was made in 1966, when Interstate 84 (I-84) opened in New York.

The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid. Turbidity (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production, haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5¬∞ from the incoming light direction.Haze technical definition Causes Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of phytoplankton. Human activities that disturb land, such as construction, mining and agriculture, can lead to high sediment levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to storm water runoff. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as urbanized areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater pollution from paved surfaces such as roads, bridges, parking lots and airports.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. \\"National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Urban Areas.\\" Chapters 7 and 8. Document No. EPA 841-B-05-004. November 2005. Some industries such as quarrying, mining and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles. In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop gastrointestinal diseases.A.G. Mann, C.C. Tam, C.D. Higgins, & L.C. Lodrigues. (2007). The association between drinking water turbidity and gastrointestinal illness: a systematic review. BMC Public Health. 7(256): 1 - 7 This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like viruses or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from ultraviolet (UV) sterilization of water. In water bodies such as lakes, rivers and reservoirs, high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annapolis, Maryland. \\"Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay.\\"EPA. Chesapeake Bay Program. Annapolis, Maryland. \\"Sediments.\\" For many mangrove areas, high turbidity is needed in order to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of Australia, in particular Moreton Bay, turbidity levels as high as 600 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper ecosystem health. Measurement Turbid creek water caused by heavy rains. The most widely used measurement unit for turbidity is the Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU). ISO refers to its units as FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Units). ISO 7027 provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the concentration of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a photodiode, which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. Open source hardware has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an Arduino microcontroller and inexpensive LEDs.Bas Wijnen, G. C. Anzalone and Joshua M. Pearce, Open-source mobile water quality testing platform. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(3) pp. 532‚Äì537 (2014). , open access preprint There are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of attenuation (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or JTU) is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs. The propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a nephelometer with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are many small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation. Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a Secchi disk. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the euphotic zone with a 3-fold division of the Secchi depth, however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom. An additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube.Waterwatch Australia, Module 4 - physical and chemical parameters \\"Methods Turbidity\\"Myre, E, Shaw, R. The Turbidity Tube: Simple and Accurate Measurement of Turbidity in the Field. \\"The Turbidity Tube\\" The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the Secchi disk. Turbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (TL).HelioClim (Center for Energy and Processes). Paris, France. \\"Linke Turbidity Factor.\\" Kasten, F. The linke turbidity factor based on improved values of the integral Rayleigh optical thickness. Solar Energy 56:3, 269 (1996) . Standards and test methods Turbidimeters used at a water purification plant to measure turbidity (in NTU) of raw water and clear water after filtration. =Drinking water standards= Governments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods must not have a turbidity higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU.EPA. Washington, District of Columbia. \\"Drinking Water Contaminants.\\" 2009-09-11.

This is also available on CD- ROM and online by subscription. Treatment Turbidity is commonly treated using either a settling or filtration process. Depending on the application, chemical reagents will be dosed into the wastewater stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. Potable water treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of sand filtration, settling tanks, and clarifiers. In-situ water treatment or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a flocculant, evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at coal mines and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in- situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents. =Reagents= There are a number of chemical reagents that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents available for treating turbidity include aluminium sulfate or alum (Al2(SO4)3¬∑nH2O), ferric chloride (FeCl3), gypsum (CaSO4¬∑2H2O), poly-aluminium chloride, long chain acrylamide-based polymers and numerous proprietary reagents.Earth Systems, Clear Solutions newsletter - Focus on Turbidity 2003. The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the pH of the water. The dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the flocs may be broken apart by excessive mixing.

In 1986, Tass Times in Tonetown followed. Interplay made a name for itself as a quality developer of role-playing video games with the three-part series The Bard's Tale (1985‚Äì1988), critically acclaimed Wasteland (1988) and Dragon Wars (1989). All of them were published by Electronic Arts. Interplay started publishing its own games, starting with Neuromancer and Battle Chess, in 1988, and then moved on to publish and distribute games from other companies, while continuing internal game development. In 1995, Interplay published the hit game Descent, developed by startup Parallax Software. Interplay published several Star Trek video games, including Star Trek: 25th Anniversary for computers and for Nintendo Entertainment System and Star Trek: Judgment Rites. These games had later CD- ROM editions released with the original Star Trek cast providing voices. Interplay also published Starfleet Academy and Klingon Academy games, and Starfleet Command series, beginning with Star Trek: Starfleet Command. Another game, Star Trek: Secret of Vulcan Fury, was in development in the late 1990s but was never completed and much of its staff laid off due to budgetary cuts prompted by various factors. In 1995, after several years of delays, Interplay finally published its role-playing game Stonekeep. Other PC games released during the mid- to late 1990s included Carmageddon, Fragile Allegiance, Hardwar and Redneck Rampage. In 1997, Interplay developed and released Fallout, a successful and critically acclaimed role-playing video game set in a retro-futuristic post-apocalyptic setting. Black Isle Studios, a newly created in-house developer, followed with the sequel, Fallout 2, in 1998. Another successful subsequent Interplay franchise was Baldur's Gate, a Dungeons & Dragons game that was developed by BioWare and which spawned a successful expansion, sequel and spin-off series. The spin-off series started with Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance; the game's success forged a sequel as well. Aside from Dark Alliance, Interplay published a few notable console series such as Loaded and the fighting game series ClayFighter and the games by Shiny Entertainment, MDK and Wild 9.https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/06/20/e3-interplay-looks-at-shinys-wild-9 = Interplay Entertainment = By 1998, the financial situation at Interplay was dire and the company was in bankruptcy court. To avert bankruptcy, Interplay went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the name Interplay Entertainment. Interplay continued to endure losses under Brian Fargo due to increased competition, less than stellar returns on Interplay's sports division and the lack of console titles. This forced Interplay to seek additional funding two years later with an investment from Titus Software, a Paris-based game company. Titus agreed to invest 25 million dollars in Interplay and a few months later this was followed up by an additional 10 million investment. Interplay also acquired a 49.9% ownership in publisher Virgin Interactive in February 1999. With this, Interplay would be able to distribute Virgin's games in North America, while Virgin would distribute Interplay's games in Europe. By 2001, Titus Interactive completed its acquisition of majority control of Interplay. Immediately afterwards, they shed most of Interplay's publisher functions and signed a long-term agreement under which Vivendi Universal Games would distribute Interplay's games. Eventually, Interplay founder Brian Fargo departed at the start of 2002 to found InXile Entertainment as Fargo's plan to change Interplay's main focus from PC gaming to console gaming failed. Herve Caen took over the role of CEO to perform triage and made several unpopular but arguably necessary decisions to cancel various projects, in order to save the company. Interplay sold Shiny Entertainment to Infogrames and several game properties while closing BlueSky Software. Due to a low share price, Interplay's shares were delisted from the NASDAQ in 2002 and now trade on the over the counter (OTC) market. Interplay's European operations were completely sold to Titus Interactive, which included their share of Virgin Interactive, which Titus renamed to Avalon Interactive in August 2003. With this, Titus had complete control over publishing and distributing Interplay's games in Europe under the Avalon Interactive name. On September 29, 2003, Interplay announced it had canceled its distribution deal with Vivendi Universal Games, due to Vivendi suing them for alleged breaches of the working agreement and failure of payment. On December 8, 2003, Interplay laid off the entire Black Isle Studios staff. The company was also involved in issues including debt. Feargus Urquhart later left Black Isle Studios and Interplay suffered a loss of US$20 million in that year. In 2005, Titus Interactive, S.A. filed for bankruptcy and closed down all their assets parts of which Interplay acquired. The bankruptcy of Titus led to Interplay being burdened with debt. Interplay faced bankruptcy again and was brought to bankruptcy court in 2006. To pay off creditors, the company altered its licensing agreement with Bethesda Software and then sold the Fallout IP to Bethesda Softworks in 2007. In September 2008, several games from Interplay's catalog were re-released on the digital distribution service GOG.com after being unavailable in retail distribution for years.Q&A;: GOG.com's DRM-free downloadable games \\"GOG.com's Interplay catalogue‚Äîwhich includes classics like the Fallout series, MDK 1 and 2, the Descent series, Messiah, Giants: Citizen Kabuto. and Sacrifice.\\" by GameSpot Staff on September 8, 2008 In August 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the FreeSpace franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.Interplay Buys Freespace Rights For a Cool $7,500 In September 2016, Interplay announced its intent to sell off its intellectual property, composed of 70 games, working together with Wedbush Securities. Interplay is co-publishing with 3D Realms, a remaster of Xatrix Entertainment's 1999 game Kingpin: Life of Crime which was originally published by Interplay. Known as Kingpin: Reloaded, the game will be developed by Slipgate Ironworks. This was announced on January 17, 2020.  Litigation  In 2003 and 2004 Snowblind Studios and Interplay Entertainment were engaged in a dispute regarding the Dark Alliance Engine for Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II, and the GameCube version of the original Dark Alliance. The dispute was resolved and Interplay would be allowed to work with materials already using the Dark Alliance Engine. Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay in 2009, regarding the Fallout Online license and selling of Fallout Trilogy and sought an injunction to stop development of Fallout Online and sales of Fallout Trilogy. After several trials spanning almost three years, and in exchange for 2 million dollars, Interplay gave Bethesda the full rights for Fallout Online. Interplay's rights to sell and merchandise Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel expired on December 31, 2013. In 2010, Topware Interactive revealed that they were developing Battle vs. Chess to be published by SouthPeak Games. Interplay sued them and won an injunction to stop sales in the United States. In 2012, Interplay won the case via default and a settlement for $200,000 plus interest was agreed upon on November 15, 2012.

The highway is known as the Bayway, North Avenue and Elmora Avenue from the Goethals Bridge and Interstate 278 (I-278) and does a loop around Elizabeth, with the designation terminating at an intersection with Route 27 in Elizabeth. The highway originated as part of Route 28 south of the current intersection with Route 28 and Route S24 (which made up several routes) north of that intersection to Route 82\\\\. The current designation of Route 439 was assigned in the 1953 renumbering. Route description Route 439 begins at an intersection with Union County Route 616 (CR 616) and I-278 near the Goethals Bridge in Elizabeth. The highway progresses westward, passing to the south of the Number 22 Elementary School. The surroundings of the highway are densely populated, with buildings surrounding the highway the entire time. Turning to the northeast, Route 439 intersects with the southern terminus of CR 623 (South Broad Street) and enters the small community of Bayway, for which the highway is named. There, the route intersects with U.S. Routes 1 & 9 (US 1/9) at the Bayway Circle, where it changes monikers to South Elmora Avenue and continues deeper into Elizabeth. Route 439 southbound after Route 82 at Kean University After the Bayway Circle, Route 439 continues to the northeast and into Elizabeth, where it intersects with CR 656 (Lidgerwood Avenue) and crosses the New Jersey Transit railroad line nearby. The highway then intersects with the northern terminus of CR 514, which heads southward. The development becomes more residential for a short time along Route 439, until the first intersection with Route 27 (Rahway Avenue), where the commercial development experienced earlier returns. After Route 27, the route's loop begins to turn even further northward, where it enters Elmora. The highway passes to the southwest of Carteret Park and soon leaves Elmora. North of Elmora, Route 439 intersects with CR 610 (West Grand Street) and Route 28 (Westfield Avenue), both of which parallel each other for several miles. After the intersection with Route 28, the highway begins the turn to the east once again. At an intersection with Chilton Street, the highway changes monikers to North Avenue, which it retains for the remaining length. During the curve, Route 439 enters Union and intersects with the southern terminus of Route 82, where Kean University and Phil Rizzuto Park both surround the highway. After Route 82, the highway enters Hillside and begins the eastward progression, passing to the south of Elizabeth River Park. After the curve completes, Route 439 enters Elizabeth again and intersects with County Route 623 once again and continues a short distance, where it terminates at the second intersection with Route 27\\\\. North Avenue continues eastward to an interchange with Route 81. History Route 439 originates as an alignment of New Jersey State Highway Route 28, assigned in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering from Route 28 to the intersection with US 1/9.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. The highway was set to serve a new Staten Island crossing, which finally opened on June 29, 1928. The highway that ran north of Route 28 and progressed north to the current intersection with Route 82 was New Jersey State Highway Route S-24, which a spur of Route 24 from Phillipsburg to Elizabeth. The designations remained intact for over two decades, but across the Arthur Kill in Staten Island, New York State Route 439 (NY 439) was assigned onto the Goethals Bridge, and when the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering occurred on January 1, 1953, the highway was redesignated as Route 439 to match up at the state line. The NJ alignment has remained intact since, but the New York alignment was decommissioned in 1968.

Although combat can be part of the gameplay, the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition or weapons, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies. The term \\"survival horror\\" was first used for the original Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996, which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989's Sweet Home and 1992's Alone in the Dark. The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay, and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles. Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005, the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games. This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as \\"action horror\\".  Definition  Resident Evil (1996) named and defined the survival horror genre. Survival horror refers to a subgenre of action-adventure video games that include horror game elements. The player character is vulnerable and under-armed, which puts emphasis on puzzle-solving and evasion, rather than the player taking an offensive strategy. Games commonly challenge the player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition. Another major theme throughout the genre is that of isolation. Typically, these games contain relatively few non- player characters and, as a result, frequently tell much of their story second-hand through the usage of journals, texts, or audio logs. While many action games feature lone protagonists versus swarms of enemies in a suspenseful environment, survival horror games are distinct from otherwise horror-themed action games. They tend to de-emphasize combat in favor of challenges such as hiding or running from enemies and solving puzzles. Still, it is not unusual for survival horror games to draw upon elements from first- person shooters, action-adventure games, or even role-playing games. According to IGN, \\"Survival horror is different from typical game genres in that it is not defined strictly by specific mechanics, but subject matter, tone, pacing, and design philosophy.\\"  Game design  = De-emphasized combat = Survival horror games are a subgenre of horror games, where the player is unable to fully prepare or arm their avatar. The player usually encounters several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option, such as a limited number of weapons or invulnerable enemies; if weapons are available, their ammunition is sparser than in other games, and powerful weapons such as rocket launchers are rare, if even available at all. Thus, players are more vulnerable than in action games, and the hostility of the environment sets up a narrative where the odds are weighed decisively against the avatar. This shifts gameplay away from direct combat, and players must learn to evade enemies or turn the environment against them. Games try to enhance the experience of vulnerability by making the game single-player rather than multiplayer, and by giving the player an avatar who is more frail than the typical action game hero. The survival horror genre is also known for other non-combat challenges, such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world, and collecting and managing an inventory of items.https://bloody- disgusting.com/news/3234623/horror-declassified-a-look-at-inventory-and- resources/ Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items. Occasionally, levels are designed with alternative routes. Levels also challenge players with mazelike environments, which test the player's navigational skills. Levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic (often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility) to challenge the player and provide suspense, although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments. = Enemy design = A survival horror storyline usually involves the investigation and confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases used camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk in areas that are concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Games typically feature a variety of monsters with unique behavior patterns. Enemies can appear unexpectedly or suddenly, and levels are often designed with scripted sequences where enemies drop from the ceiling or crash through windows. Survival horror games, like many action-adventure games, are sometimes structured around the boss encounter where the player must confront a formidable opponent in order to advance to the next area. These boss encounters draw elements from antagonists seen in classic horror stories, and defeating the boss will advance the story of the game.  History  = Origins (1980s-1996) = The origins of the survival horror game can be traced back to earlier horror fiction. Archetypes have been linked to the books of H. P. Lovecraft, which include investigative narratives, or journeys through the depths. Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft's Great Old Ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games. Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre, where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist. Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror, including classical Noh theatre, the books of Edogawa Rampo, and Japanese cinema. The survival horror genre largely draws from both Western (mainly American) and Asian (mainly Japanese) traditions, with the Western approach to horror generally favoring action-oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror. Nostromo was a survival horror game developed by Akira Takiguchi, a Tokyo University student and Taito contractor, for the PET 2001. It was ported to the PC-6001 by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined Game Arts), and published by ASCII in 1981, exclusively for Japan. Inspired by the 1979 Japanese only stealth game Manbiki Shounen (Shoplifting Boy) by Hiroshi Suzuki and the 1979 sci-fi horror film Alien, the gameplay of Nostromo involved a player attempting to escape a spaceship while avoiding the sight of an invisible alien, which only becomes visible when appearing in front of the player. The gameplay also involved limited resources, where the player needs to collect certain items in order to escape the ship, and if certain required items are not available in the warehouse, the player is unable to escape and eventually has no choice but be killed getting caught by the alien. Another early example is the 1982 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future survival horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses creatures commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, each of which has unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre. Malcolm Evans' 3D Monster Maze, released for the Sinclair ZX81 in 1982, is a first-person game without a weapon; the player cannot fight the enemy, a Tyrannosaurus rex, so he must escape by finding the exit before the monster finds him. The game states its distance and awareness of the player, further raising tension. Edge stated it was about \\"fear, panic, terror and facing an implacable, relentless foe who‚Äôs going to get you in the end\\" and considers it \\"the original survival horror game\\". Retro Gamer stated, \\"Survival horror may have been a phrase first coined by Resident Evil, but it could‚Äôve easily applied to Malcolm Evans‚Äô massive hit.\\" 1982 saw the release of another early horror game, Bandai's Terror House,Earliest Japanese Horror Games based on traditional Japanese horror,Laurence C. Bush (2001), Asian horror encyclopedia: Asian horror culture in literature, manga and folklore, p. 8, Writers Club Press, released as a Bandai LCD Solarpower handheld game. It was a solar-powered game with two LCD panels on top of each other to enable impressive scene changes and early pseudo-3D effects.The Handheld Museum: A tribute to the early history of handheld gaming, CNET.com The amount of ambient light the game received also had an effect on the gaming experience.The top ten retro gaming secrets, CNET.com Another early example of a horror game released that year was Sega's arcade game Monster Bash, which introduced classic horror-movie monsters, including the likes of Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and werewolves, helping to lay the foundations for future survival horror games.Monster Bash, A.V. Club Its 1986 remake Ghost House had gameplay specifically designed around the horror theme, featuring haunted house stages full of traps and secrets, and enemies that were fast, powerful, and intimidating, forcing players to learn the intricacies of the house and rely on their wits. Another game that has been cited as one of the first horror-themed games is Quicksilva's 1983 maze game Ant Attack. The latter half of the 1980s saw the release of several other horror-themed games, including Konami's Castlevania in 1986, and Sega's Kenseiden and Namco's Splatterhouse in 1988, though despite the macabre imagery of these games, their gameplay did not diverge much from other action games at the time. Splatterhouse in particular is notable for its large amount of bloodshed and terror, despite being an arcade beat 'em up with very little emphasis on survival.EGM Heads to the Splatterhouse , 1UP Shiryou Sensen: War of the Dead, a 1987 title developed by Fun Factory and published by Victor Music Industries for the MSX2, PC-88 and PC Engine platforms, is considered the first true survival horror game by Kevin Gifford (of GamePro and 1UP)Kevin Gifford, Shiry≈ç Sensen: War of the Dead, Magweasel.com, November 10, 2009 and John Szczepaniak (of Retro Gamer and The Escapist).John Szczepaniak, War of the Dead, Hardcore Gaming 101, 15 January 2011 Designed by Katsuya Iwamoto, the game was a horror action RPG revolving around a female SWAT member Lila rescuing survivors in an isolated monster-infested town and bringing them to safety in a church. It has open environments like Dragon Quest and real-time side-view battles like Zelda II, though War of the Dead departed from other RPGs with its dark and creepy atmosphere expressed through the storytelling, graphics, and music. The player character has limited ammunition, though the player character can punch or use a knife if out of ammunition. The game also has a limited item inventory and crates to store items, and introduced a day- night cycle; the player can sleep to recover health, and a record is kept of how many days the player has survived. In 1988, War of the Dead Part 2 for the MSX2 and PC-88 abandoned the RPG elements of its predecessor, such as random encounters, and instead adopted action-adventure elements from Metal Gear while retaining the horror atmosphere of its predecessor. Sweet Home (1989), pictured above, was a role-playing video game often called the first survival horror and cited as the main inspiration for Resident Evil. However, the game often considered the first true survival horror, due to having the most influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release Sweet Home, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil.The Man Who Made Ghosts‚Äôn Goblins: Tokuro Fujiwara Interview , Continue, Vol. 12, 2003 Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, which could lead to permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game.Time Machine: Sweet Home, Computer and Video Games Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game. In 1989, Electronic Arts published Project Firestart, developed by Dynamix. Unlike most other early games in the genre, it featured a science fiction setting inspired by the film Alien, but had gameplay that closely resembled later survival horror games in many ways. Travis Fahs considers it the first to achieve \\"the kind of fully formed vision of survival horror as we know it today,\\" citing its balance of action and adventure, limited ammunition, weak weaponry, vulnerable main character, feeling of isolation, storytelling through journals, graphic violence, and use of dynamically triggered music - all of which are characteristic elements of later games in the survival horror genre. Despite this, it is not likely a direct influence on later games in the genre and the similarities are largely an example of parallel thinking. Alone in the Dark (1992) is considered a forefather of the survival horror genre, and is sometimes called a survival horror game in retrospect. In 1992, Infogrames released Alone in the Dark, which has been considered a forefather of the genre.Travis Fahs, Alone in the Dark Restrospective, IGN, June 23, 2008 The game featured a lone protagonist against hordes of monsters, and made use of traditional adventure game challenges such as puzzle-solving and finding hidden keys to new areas. Graphically, Alone in the Dark uses static prerendered camera views that were cinematic in nature. Although players had the ability to fight monsters as in action games, players also had the option to evade or block them. Many monsters could not be killed, and thus could only be dealt with using problem-solving abilities. The game also used the mechanism of notes and books as expository devices. Many of these elements were used in later survival horror games, and thus the game is credited with making the survival horror genre possible. In 1994, Riverhillsoft released Doctor Hauzer for the 3DO. Both the player character and the environment are rendered in polygons. The player can switch between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead. In a departure from most survival horror games, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. The sound of the player character's echoing footsteps change depending on the surface. In 1995, WARP's horror adventure game D featured a first-person perspective, CGI full-motion video, gameplay that consisted entirely of puzzle-solving, and taboo content such as cannibalism. The same year, Human Entertainment's Clock Tower was a survival horror game that employed point-and-click graphic adventure gameplay and a deadly stalker known as Scissorman that chases players throughout the game. The game introduced stealth game elements,Shane Patterson (2009-02-03), The Sneaky History of Stealth Games, GamesRadar, Retrieved 2009-06-21 and was unique for its lack of combat, with the player only able to run away or outsmart Scissorman in order to survive. It features up to nine different possible endings. The term \\"survival horror\\" was first used by Capcom to market their 1996 release, Resident Evil.\\"Enter The Survival Horror... A Resident Evil Retrospective,\\" Game Informer 174 (October 2007): 132-133. It began as a remake of Sweet Home, borrowing various elements from the game, such as its mansion setting, puzzles, \\"opening door\\" load screen, death animations, multiple endings depending on which characters survive, dual character paths, individual character skills, limited item management, story told through diary entries and frescos, emphasis on atmosphere, and horrific imagery. Resident Evil also adopted several features seen in Alone in the Dark, notably its cinematic fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backdrops.Resident Evil Creator Shinji Mikami Reflects on the Series' Roots, GameSpot (March 22, 2016) The control scheme in Resident Evil also became a staple of the genre, and future titles imitated its challenge of rationing very limited resources and items. The game's commercial success is credited with helping the PlayStation become the dominant game console, and also led to a series of Resident Evil films. Many games have tried to replicate the successful formula seen in Resident Evil, and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it. = Golden age (1996-2004) = The success of Resident Evil in 1996 was responsible for its template being used as the basis for a wave of successful survival horror games, many of which were referred to as \\"Resident Evil clones.\\" The golden age of survival horror started by Resident Evil reached its peak around the turn of the millennium with Silent Hill, followed by a general decline a few years later. Among the Resident Evil clones at the time, there were several survival horror titles that stood out, such as Clock Tower (1996) and Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within (1998) for the PlayStation. These Clock Tower games proved to be hits, capitalizing on the success of Resident Evil while staying true to the graphic-adventure gameplay of the original Clock Tower rather than following the Resident Evil formula. Another survival horror title that differentiated itself was Corpse Party (1996), an indie, psychological horror adventure game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like Clock Tower and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. Another game similar to the Clock Tower series of games and Haunting Ground, which was also inspired by Resident Evil's success is the Korean game known as White Day: A Labyrinth Named School (2001). This game was reportedly so scary that the developers had to release several patches adding multiple difficulty options, and the game was slated for localization in 2004 but was cancelled. Building on its previous success in Korea and interest, a remake has been developed in 2015. Riverhillsoft's Overblood, released in 1996, is considered the first survival horror game to make use of a fully three- dimensional virtual environment. The Note in 1997 and Hellnight in 1998 experimented with using a real-time 3D first-person perspective rather than pre-rendered backgrounds like Resident Evil. In 1998, Capcom released the successful sequel Resident Evil 2, which series creator Shinji Mikami intended to tap into the classic notion of horror as \\"the ordinary made strange,\\" thus rather than setting the game in a creepy mansion no one would visit, he wanted to use familiar urban settings transformed by the chaos of a viral outbreak. The game sold over five million copies, proving the popularity of survival horror. That year saw the release of Square's Parasite Eve, which combined elements from Resident Evil with the RPG gameplay of Final Fantasy. It was followed by a more action-based sequel, Parasite Eve II, in 1999. In 1998, Galerians discarded the use of guns in favour of psychic powers that make it difficult to fight more than one enemy at a time. Also in 1998, Blue Stinger was a fully 3D survival horror game for the Dreamcast incorporating action elements from beat 'em up and shooter games.Bartholow, Peter. Blue Stinger review for DreamCast at GameSpot. GameSpot. Accessed July 17, 2005. The Silent Hill series, pictured above, introduced a psychological horror style to the genre. The most renowned was Silent Hill 2 (2001), for its strong narrative. Konami's Silent Hill, released in 1999, drew heavily from Resident Evil while using real-time 3D environments in contrast to Resident Evil's pre-rendered graphics. Silent Hill in particular was praised for moving away from B movie horror elements to the psychological style seen in art house or Japanese horror films, due to the game's emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror. The game also featured stealth elements, making use of the fog to dodge enemies or turning off the flashlight to avoid detection. The original Silent Hill is considered one of the scariest games of all time, and the strong narrative from Silent Hill 2 in 2001 has made the Silent Hill series one of the most influential in the genre. According to IGN, the \\"golden age of survival horror came to a crescendo\\" with the release of Silent Hill. Also in 1999, Capcom released the original Dino Crisis, which was noted for incorporating certain elements from survival horror games. It was followed by a more action-based sequel, Dino Crisis 2, in 2000. Fatal Frame from 2001 was a unique entry into the genre, as the player explores a mansion and takes photographs of ghosts in order to defeat them. The Fatal Frame series has since gained a reputation as one of the most distinctive in the genre, with the first game in the series credited as one of the best-written survival horror games ever made, by UGO Networks. Meanwhile, Capcom incorporated shooter elements into several survival horror titles, such as 2000's Resident Evil Survivor which used both light gun shooter and first-person shooter elements, and 2003's Resident Evil: Dead Aim which used light gun and third- person shooter elements. Western developers began to return to the survival horror formula. The Thing from 2002 has been called a survival horror game, although it is distinct from other titles in the genre due to its emphasis on action, and the challenge of holding a team together. The 2004 title Doom 3 is sometimes categorized as survival horror, although it is considered an Americanized take on the genre due to the player's ability to directly confront monsters with weaponry. Thus, it is usually considered a first-person shooter with survival horror elements. Regardless, the genre's increased popularity led Western developers to incorporate horror elements into action games, rather than follow the Japanese survival style. Overall, the traditional survival horror genre continued to be dominated by Japanese designers and aesthetics. 2002's Clock Tower 3 eschewed the graphic adventure game formula seen in the original Clock Tower, and embraced full 3D survival horror gameplay. In 2003, Resident Evil Outbreak introduced a new gameplay element to the genre: online multiplayer and cooperative gameplay. Sony employed Silent Hill director Keiichiro Toyama to develop Siren. The game was released in 2004, and added unprecedented challenge to the genre by making the player mostly defenseless, thus making it vital to learn the enemy's patrol routes and hide from them. However, reviewers eventually criticized the traditional Japanese survival horror formula for becoming stagnant. As the console market drifted towards Western-style action games, players became impatient with the limited resources and cumbersome controls seen in Japanese titles such as Resident Evil Code: Veronica and Silent Hill 4: The Room. = Transformation (2005-present) = In recent years, developers have combined traditional survival horror gameplay with other concepts. Left 4 Dead (2008) fused survival horror with cooperative multiplayer and action. In 2005, Resident Evil 4 attempted to redefine the genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre. Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers to suggest that the Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming, and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror. The original genre has persisted in one form or another. The 2005 release of F.E.A.R. was praised for both its atmospheric tension and fast action, successfully combining Japanese horror with cinematic action, while Dead Space from 2008 brought survival horror to a science fiction setting. However, critics argue that these titles represent the continuing trend away from pure survival horror and towards general action. The release of Left 4 Dead in 2008 helped popularize cooperative multiplayer among survival horror games, although it is mostly a first-person shooter at its core. Meanwhile, the Fatal Frame series has remained true to the roots of the genre, even as Fatal Frame IV transitioned from the use of fixed cameras to an over-the-shoulder viewpoint. Also in 2009, Silent Hill made a transition to an over-the-shoulder viewpoint in Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. This Wii effort was, however, considered by most reviewers as a return to form for the series due to several developmental decisions taken by Climax Studios. This included the decision to openly break the fourth wall by psychologically profiling the player, and the decision to remove any weapons from the game, forcing the player to run whenever they see an enemy.https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-silent-hill-shattered- memories-wii--157608.phtml Examples of independent survival horror games are the Penumbra series and Amnesia: The Dark Descent by Frictional Games, Nightfall: Escape by Zeenoh, Cry of Fear by Team Psykskallar and Slender: The Eight Pages, all of which were praised for creating a horrific setting and atmosphere without the overuse of violence or gore. In 2010, the cult game Deadly Premonition by Access Games was notable for introducing open world nonlinear gameplay and a comedy horror theme to the genre. Overall, game developers have continued to make and release survival horror games, and the genre continues to grow among independent video game developers. The Last of Us, released in 2013 by Naughty Dog, incorporated many survival horror elements into a third-person action game. Set twenty years after a pandemic plague, the player must use scarce ammo and distraction tactics to evade or kill malformed humans infected by a brain parasite, as well as dangerous survivalists. Five Nights at Freddy's released August 8, 2014, is a survival game taking place in a pizzeria with possessed animatronics. The series has gone to changes with Five Nights at Freddy's Sister Location and Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted. The latest game is Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special Delivery. Shinji Mikami, the creator of the Resident Evil franchise, released his new survival horror game The Evil Within, in 2014. Mikami stated that his goal was to bring survival horror back to its roots (even though this is his last directorial work), as he was disappointed by recent survival horror games for having too much action. That same year, Alien: Isolation, developed by Creative Assembly and based on the Alien science fiction horror film series, was released. The game updated the concept of a single un- killable villain chasing the protagonist throughout most of the game, requiring the player to use stealth to proceed and received high praise for its AI, art design and faithfulness to its source material. In 2015, Until Dawn, developed by Supermassive Games, was published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. The game is an interactive drama in which the player controls multiple characters and features a butterfly effect system in which the player's choices can change the story and may dictate who survives the night. All playable characters can survive or die, depending on the choices made. Players explore the environment from a third-person perspective and find clues that may help solve the mystery. In 2017, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, focusing on a return to survival horror for the series after several previous action-oriented entries, was released by Capcom. It utilizes a first-person perspective and encourages resource management and puzzle-solving. A remake of Resident Evil 2 was followed in early 2019, updating the game to include \\"over-the-shoulder\\" third-person shooter gameplay similar to Resident Evil 4 while retaining the survival horror aspects of the original.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Jong-won is also engaged to a young woman, Lee Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Myung-hyun symbolically gives Jong-won a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Jong-won is worried that he cannot tell her about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Jong-won and Jang-gil are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1 km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Mu-young and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Jong-won and Jang-gil suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Bang-hee is ordered to eliminate the 'kissing gourami' obstacle. Jong-won meets with Police Chief Ho to borrow outside forces but Ho accidentally stands in the path of a bullet fired by Bang-hee's sniper rifle. Mu-young calls Jong-won and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. He also mockingly mentions Jong-won's fianc√©. It is revealed that Mu-young and Jong-won have a history: Mu-young once hijacked a civilian airliner and killed many civilians, but managed to escape by disguising himself as a wounded member of the flight crew. The first of the CTX bombs is found on top of a department store, but Mu-young lied about the time factor. The bomb explodes just as the bomb disposal team discover its exact location, resulting in dozens of deaths. Jong-won takes Myung-hyun to hide out at a hotel and she begins drinking again. Jong-won suspects Jang-gil as the leak - who suspects the same thing, as Jong-won has twice survived encounters with Bang-hee he should have died in, and bugged Jong-won's car and phone to see if he could learn anything. Jong-won sets a trap by telling Jang-gil he has new information - which Mu-young and his fellow agents step into - but the situation quickly escalates into a firefight resulting in police and civilian casualties. Several of the Northern agents are killed while others escape. When Mu-young is cornered, Bang-hee comes in to save him. Jong-won, having survived his stand-off with Mu-young and Bang-hee, follows a wounded Bang-hee. He loses her but notices the light to the aquarium turn on and covertly enters, discovering a bleeding Myung-hyun removing her disguise. Jong-won walks away, shocked, and conducts a solo investigation into her history with the real, sick Myung-hyun. Mu-young confronts Bang-hee about her hesitancy and constant failure to kill Jong-won, reminding her of their primary objective. Mu-young calls NIS, demanding millions as well as a plane for an escape at 2pm in return for the remaining CTX. Myung-hyun's identity is confirmed by the agency later when electronic surveillance devices are discovered in fish decorating the NIS's office supplied by her. Jang-gil confronts her in her shop, and is shot by Mu-young. Jong-won suddenly appears with officers, who engage in a firefight with Mu-young and his agents. Mu-young and Myung-hyun escape, while a dying Jang-gil hands Myung-hyun's soccer match ticket to Jong- won, set to start at 2pm. The terrorists aim to detonate a CTX bomb directly over the Royal Box, housing all senior North and South Korean politicians, at a soccer stadium in the midst of an international friendly match played by a North and South Korean team. Jong-won attempts to tell NIS of the ruse and the danger in the stadium but is ignored. He defies orders and rushes to the stadium, where Mu-young, Bang-hee, and other terrorists mingle with the crowd. They find a total ban on all liquids, but enter easily as the CTX and weapons were already planted in the stadium beforehand. Bang-hee retrieves a hidden Steyr AUG from a restroom cubicle, while Mu-young and his agents tail several patrolling South Korean SWAT officers who later adjourn to the restrooms. There, the policemen are killed and their bodies quickly dragged away. Myung- hyun advances into the grandstand with her rifle, while Mu-young and three other men, now disguised as South Korean SWAT officers in uniforms stolen from the dead policemen, enter the stadium control room, killing all but one there and forcing the remaining staff to switch on the stadium lights to trigger the CTX. Jong-won arrives at the stadium and notices the lights. Jong-won goes to the control room to have them shut off but is taken captive. Sik, a rookie NIS agent, also notices the lights and soon comes in with backup. A violent confrontation in the control room results in the death of all four terrorists, and the lights are switched off in the nick of time. Myung-hyun notices this, and fires at the VIPs, but misses her target. Chasing after the entourage, she kills several more SWAT officers along the way before being confronted by a large group of officers led by Jong-won. As she makes a last-ditch attempt to complete her mission, she is shot dead by Jong-won. Jong-won later learns that Bang-hee (whom he knew as Myung-hyun) was pregnant with his child, and had left details of the renegade Northern agents' plan and her planned location on his answering machine before leaving for the stadium but had requested he not confront her himself, professing her love for him. Jong-won then visits the real Myung-hyun, who is at a hospital for chemo therapy, and Myung-hyun reminisces about Bang-hee with Jong-won. Myung-hyun lets Jong-won listen to that song, and while listening to it Jong-won is captivated by the lyrics. The scene then fades, while Jong-won, still listening to the song, shuts his eyes.

Part of the funding was covered by the Korean electronics giant Samsung. The film was a critical and financial success in Korea and broke box office records. Shiri was seen in South Korean cinemas by 6.5 million people, beating the previous record set by Titanic of 4.3 million. It was also successful throughout the rest of Asia (it was a top-grossing film when released in Hong Kong), and has since been issued on video worldwide. It has also played theatrically in limited engagements in the West. Reception The film was voted the favorite film of Koreans with 11,918 votes in a 2002 online poll of 54,013 people conducted by Korean movie channel Orion Cinema Network.* In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. Shiri was listed at 96th place on this list.  Legacy  The film would later serve as the basis for the television series Iris, starring Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae- hee.

Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and three kinds of vegetables ‚Äï celery, bell peppers, and onions. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether okra or fil√© powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves). Gumbo can be made with or without okra or fil√© powder. The preferred method in the historical New Orleans variation is with a French dark roux. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures. Creole gumbo generally contains shellfish, and a dark roux, fil√©, or both. Tomatoes are traditionally found in Creole gumbo and frequently appear in New Orleans cuisine. Cajun gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl. Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, fil√© powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served with rice. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens. The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, Spanish, German, and Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish. Etymology The name of the dish comes from Louisiana French. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the etymology of the word \\"gumbo\\". The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, okra or fil√©. In the Niger‚ÄìCongo languages spoken by many slaves from West Africa, the vegetable okra was known as ki ngombo or quingombo; the word is akin to the Umbundu ochingg√¥mbo and the Tshiluba chingg√¥mb√¥ \\"okra\\". In the language of the native Choctaw people, fil√©, or ground sassafras leaves, was called kombo.Nobles (2009), p. 98. Variations Gumbo is a heavily seasoned soup or stew that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a sauce or gravy. Any combination of meat or seafood can be used. Meat-based gumbo may consist of chicken, duck, squirrel, or rabbit, with oysters occasionally added. Seafood- based gumbo generally has shrimp, crab meat, and sometimes oysters. Andouille sausage is often added to both meat and seafood gumbos to provide \\"piquancy, substance, and an additional layer of flavor\\" to the dish. Most varieties of gumbo are seasoned with onions, parsley, bell pepper, and celery.Gutierrez (1992), p. 56. Tomatoes are sometimes used in seafood gumbo, but traditionally few other vegetables are included. =Thickeners= Okra pods Sassafras leaves, source of fil√© powder Gumbo broth or gravy derives from three primary thickeners: okra, fil√© powder, and roux. Traditionally, okra and fil√© powder are not used in the same dish, although this rule is sometimes broken.Nobles (2009), p. 107. Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners.Nobles (2009), p. 111.Gutierrez (1992), pp. 55‚Äì56. Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat. This mucilaginous vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached. According to The Oxford Companion to Food, okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as the okra texture has become less palatable to changing tastes. Ground sassafras leaf, known as fil√©, is generally not added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and have been removed from the heat source. If added during the boiling process, fil√© makes the gumbo too ropey; when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture. Roux has become the most popular thickener,Davidson and Jain (2006), p. 126. made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog lard, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th centuryNobles (2009), p. 113.). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains. A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux. =Cajun vs. Creole gumbo= Cajun seafood gumbo Creole seafood gumbo Gumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in New Orleans and southeastern Louisiana are known as \\"Creole\\" after the Louisiana Creole people, descendants of French and Spanish settlers, and enslaved African people, who lived in those areas. \\"Cajun\\" combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by Cajuns, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from Acadia (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) in the mid-18th century. Gumbo is usually identified by its dark roux, cooked until it is a color \\"a few shades from burning\\". The roux is used with okra or fil√© powder. Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage. The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish. Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions. Creole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener. Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo. =Gumbo z'herbes= Gumbo z'herbes, served with fil√© powder and hot sauce When Catholics were expected to abstain from eating meat during Lent, a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z'herbes (from gumbo aux herbes, or \\"gumbo of greens\\"), was often served.Williams (2012), p. 160 This variety combined varied greens ‚Äì typically including turnips, mustard greens, and spinach.Gutierrez (1992), p. 57. The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid. Preparation for this variety of gumbo was time-consuming, and as Lenten restrictions have relaxed, the dish has become less popular. It is very rarely served in restaurants.Nobles (2009), p. 110. In modern times, ham or crabmeat is occasionally added to this type of gumbo. Gumbo z'herbes may have originated with the French, Germans, or West Africans.Nobles (2009), p. 109. It has similarities to the French dish potage aux herbes (\\"soup with greens\\"), as well as to the African callaloo. The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date. History =Background= Gumbo is often used as a metaphor for the mix of cultures that exist in southern Louisiana. The dish combines the culinary practices of Africans, Native Americans, French, Spanish, as well as Italians and Germans. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. In this environment, cultures could influence each other and meld to create new traditions and cuisine.Brasseaux (1987), p. 134. The establishment of New Orleans in 1718 marked the beginning of the French colony of Louisiana.Hall (1992), p. 159. French settlers allied with various native tribes including the Choctaw, Alabama, and Cherokee,Hall (1992), p. 19. from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.Hall (1992), p. 14. Slave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719. The first ships carried rice and men who were experienced in its cultivation.Hall (1992), p. 10. The grain adapted well to its new environment, and within a few years, rice was commonly grown along the Mississippi River.Nobles (2009), p. 100. In 1721, 125 Germans settled from New Orleans, and introduced the art of making sausage.Nobles (2009), p. 101. By 1746, the white population of Louisiana was estimated to be 3,200, with an estimated 4,730 black people. Slaves outnumbered whites in most areas of Louisiana for at least the next 40 years.Hall (1992), p. 9.Hall (1992), p. 278. The colony was transferred from French to Spanish control in 1762. The Spanish government actively recruited settlers for Spanish Louisiana.Hall (1992), p. 266. About 2,000 people from the Canary Islands moved to the area south of New Orleans.Hall (1992), p. 277. These settlers were primarily fishermen who soon began supplying large amounts of shrimp, crab, and oysters to the food markets in New Orleans. The Canary Islanders also brought \\"a love for well-seasoned food\\",Nobles (2009), p. 102. including use of ground cayenne pepper, a spicy hot red chili pepper.Nobles (2009), p. 104. Spanish authorities also granted permission for many French-speaking Acadian exiles to relocate from northeastern North America to Louisiana. From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans. Louisiana was secretly returned to France in 1800, then purchased by the United States in 1803. The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812. By 1800, the slave trade had introduced new foods to Louisiana, including the African vegetable okra,Brasseaux (1987), p. 135. and hot pepper plants which likely came from Haiti.Nobles (2009), p. 103. Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions. Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.Nobles (2009), p. 105. =Origin= Scholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century, but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food.Usner (2000), p. 46. Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.Bienvenue et al. (2005), p. 134. As aforementioned, while its exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often believed to be a dish of mixed origins of French, Spanish, African, Native American, Caribbean and German influence. African-American slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients in order to make the dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.Hicks, Derek S. \\"An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion\\". In Religion, Food, and Eating in North America, edited by Benjamin E. Zeller, Marie W. Dallam, Reid L. Neilson, and Nora L. Rubel, 134-154. New York: Columbia University Press, 2014. West Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups. In Louisiana, gumbo includes ingredients introduced by several cultural groups. Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.Nobles (2009), p. 100. Gumbo could instead be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew bouillabaisse. During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups, using whatever ingredients were readily available. When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage. In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew. Instead of the fish, settlers used shellfish. The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures. Some culinary experts in the early 20th century, including Celestine Eustis, maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns. They served gumbo over corn grits, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes. The use of corn and fil√© powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine. These theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by their slaves. Spanish and Choctaw introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine ‚Äì rice, shrimp, crawfish, and fil√© powder.Nobles (2009), p. 99. =Development= The first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century. In 1802, John Sibley described \\"the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop & eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.\\"quoted in Nobles (2009), p. 104. The following year, French governor Pierre Clement de Laussat hosted a soir√©e in which 24 different gumbos were prepared. According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events \\"give clues to gumbo's Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined\\". An 1824 cookbook, Mary Randolph's The Virginia House-Wife, was the first to include a recipe for gumbo. Called \\"Gumbo ‚Äì A West India Dish\\", the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo. The same book contained a recipe for \\"Ochra Soup\\" made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour. Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish callaloo.Nobles (2009), p. 106. A more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree. Her Housekeeping in Old Virginia described \\"Gumbo Filit A La Creole\\", a fil√©-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with allspice, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme. The 1881 cookbook What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking, dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. \\"Oyster Gumbo Soup\\" used a fil√© base, while \\"Ochra Gumbo\\" and \\"Chicken Gumbo\\" used okra as a base. Four years later, the cookbook La Cuisine Creole documented eight varieties of gumbo. None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham. Until the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the Gulf Coast of the United States. It gained a broader profile after the death of United States Senator Allen Ellender. A native of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents. After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor. The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef Paul Prudhomme's popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.Nobles (2009), p. 114. Preparation and serving Gumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. According to Nobles, \\"proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art\\". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process. As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, fil√© powder is added last. Creole and Cajun gumbos are served with hot rice, which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people. Gumbo z'herbes is served with rice on the side. Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a tureen on the table.Nobles (2009), p. 112. Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal,Gutierrez (1992), p. 54. although many Cajun families provide a side dish of potato salad. Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu. Soniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.Soniat (1980), p. 13. Social aspects In Cajun Foodways, C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as \\"an economical dish\\" useful for \\"feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood\\". Nobles concurs that \\"one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd\\". With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal. The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood. Since the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana.Bienvenue et al. (2005), p. 135. Local fais do-do (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight. Many families \\"have a gumbo\\", or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo. Gumbo is prepared and enjoyed by Louisianians of all races and ethnicities, and its multicultural influences have evolved it through the years. Gumbo is a feature in both urban and rural areas of Louisiana. In rural Acadiana in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of Mardi Gras celebrations. On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as courir de Mardi Gras. Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo. When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when Lent begins.Nobles (2009), p. 106. Gumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana. Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo, and it is a central feature of many local festivals.Gutierrez (1992), p. 114. The self-described \\"Gumbo Capital of the World\\", Bridge City, Louisiana, holds an annual Gumbo Festival.Theriot (2009), p. 34. The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3 ft (0.9 m) deep and in diameter. More commonly, festival gumbo pots measure 2 ft (0.6 m) in depth and diameter.

His feast is kept by the Orthodox Church on 6 April, and he is mentioned in the Catholic Church's \\"Corpus Juris\\".(Grat., I pars., Dist. XVI, Cap. x) His terms of office, occurring during the reign of Emperor Justinian the Great, were marked by controversies with both imperial and papal authority.The chronology of his life followed by Sinclair (and this article) is that fixed by Henschen in his introductory argument to the Life by Eustathius ( citing Boll. Acta SS. 6 Ap. i. 550). Early life Eutychius' career is well documented: a full biography, composed by his chaplain Eustathius of Constantinople, was preserved intact. Eutychius was born at Theium in Phrygia.William Hazlitt, ed. The Classical Gazetteer: A Dictionary of Ancient Geography, Sacred and Profane, (1851) gives only \\"Theium, a fortress of Athamania, √Ütolia, on Achelous fl[umen], n.w. of Cranon;\\" see also Livy, Book 38. His father, Alexander, was a general under the famous Byzantine commander Belisarius. Eutychius became a monk at Amasea at the age of 30. As an archimandrite at Constantinople, Eutychius was well respected by Menas, the Patriarch of Constantinople. Eventually, on the day Menas died, Eutychius was nominated by Justinian the Great as Patriarch. First patriarchate Pope Vigilius was in Constantinople when Eutychius became patriarch. Eutychius sent him the usual announcement of his own appointment and a completely orthodox profession of the then-united Church. At the same time, the Pope urged him to summon and preside over the Church Council summoned to deal with the Three- Chapter Controversy. Vigilius first gave, and then withdrew, his consent to the Council. In spite of the Pope's refusal, the council met on 5 May 553 at Constantinople, and Eutychius shared the first place in the assembly with Apollinarius of Alexandria and Domninus of Antioch (called \\"Domnus III\\", see List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch). At the second session, the pope excused himself again on the grounds of ill health. The subscription of Eutychius to the Acts of this synod, which was later recognized as the Fifth General Council and which concluded on 2 June 553, is a summary of the decrees against the Three Chapters. Eutychius had, so far, stood by the Emperor throughout. He composed the decree of the Council against The Chapters. In 562, he consecrated the new church of Hagia Sophia. However, Eutychius came into violent collision with Justinian in 564, when the Emperor adopted the tenets of the Aphthartodocetae, a sect of Non-Chalcedonians who believed that Christ's body on earth was incorruptible () and subject to no pain. Eutychius, in a long address, argued the incompatibility of the Aphthartodocetic beliefs with Scripture. Emperor Justinian insisted that he subscribe to it anyway. When Eutychius refused to compromise, Justinian ordered his arrest. On 22 January 565, Eutychius was celebrating the feast day of Saint Timothy in the church adjoining the Hormisdas Palace when soldiers broke into the patriarchal residence, entered the church, and carried him away. cites cf. du Cange, Cpolis. Chr. lib. ii. p. 96, lib. iv. p. 93, ed. 1729) Arrest and exile Eutychius was first removed to a monastery called Choracudis, and the next day to the monastery of St. Osias near Chalcedon. Eight days later Justinian called an assembly of princes and prelates, to which he summoned Eutychius. The charges against him were trivial: that he used ointments, ate \\"delicate meats\\", and prayed for long periods. cirs Eustathius, Vita S. Eutych., 4, 5. After being summoned three times, Eutychius replied that he would only come if he were to be judged canonically, in his own dignity, and in command of his clergy. Condemned by default, he was sent to an island in the Propontis named Principus (\\"Prince's Island\\"), and later to his old monastery at Amasea, where he spent 12 years and 5 months. Return and second patriarchate Upon the death of John Scholasticus, whom Justinian had put in the patriarchal chair, the people of Constantinople demanded the return of Eutychius. Justin II had succeeded Justinian in 565 and had associated with himself the young Tiberius, who was made Caesar in 574. In October 577 the two emperors sent a delegation to Amasea to bring Eutychius back to Constantinople. Contemporary reports claim that as he entered the city, a large group of people met him, shouting aloud, \\"Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,\\" and \\"Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace\\". In imitation of the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem (recorded in Matthew 21:1‚Äì11 and John 12:12‚Äì18), he entered the city on an ass's colt, over garments spread on the ground, the crowd carrying palms, dancing, and singing. The whole city was illuminated, public banquets were held, and new buildings were inaugurated. The next day he met with the two emperors and was given \\"conspicuous honor\\" at the Church of the Virgin in Blachernae. He then proceeded to Hagia Sophia, mounted the pulpit, and blessed the many people. It took him six hours to distribute the communion because all of the people wished to receive it from his own hands. Late beliefs and death Toward the end of his life, Eutychius maintained an opinion that after the resurrection the body will be \\"more subtle than air\\" and no longer a tangible thing. This was considered heretical, because it was taken as a denial of the doctrine of physical, corporeal resurrection. The future Pope Gregory the Great, then residing at Constantinople as Apocrisiarius, opposed this opinion, citing Luke 24:39. Emperor Tiberius talked to the disputants separately, and tried to reconcile them, but the breach was persistent. Eutychius died quietly on the Sunday after Easter, at the age of 70. Some of his friends later told Pope Gregory that a few minutes before his death he touched the skin of his hand and said, \\"I confess that in this flesh we shall rise again\\", cites Paul. Diac. Vit. Greg. Mag. lib. i. capp. 9, 27‚Äì30; Vit. Greg. ex ejus Script (a rough quote of Job 19:26). Among his pupils was Eustratios of Constantinople who wrote a tract against soul sleep. Extant works by Eutychius His literary remains are: * Letter to Pope Vigilius (Migne, P. L., LXIX, 63, P.G. LXXXVI, 2401) * \\"Discourse on Easter\\" (fragment) (Mai: Class. Auct. X, 488, and Script.

Arrival in Italy and first struggles  The Exarchate of Ravenna had risen in revolt in 726 at the imposition of iconoclasm; the Exarch Paul lost his life attempting to quash the revolt. In response, Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717‚Äì741) sent the eunuch patrician Eutychius to take control of the situation.. In certain historical works, Eutychius is mentioned as having served as exarch already in 710/11‚Äì713, between the tenures of John III Rizocopus and Scholasticus. This is however a modern interpolation based on an erroneous reading of the Liber pontificalis. Eutychius landed in Naples, where he called upon loyal citizens to assassinate Pope Gregory II. When the citizens responded by pledging to defend the Pope and to die in his defense, Eutychius turned his attention to the Lombards, offering King Liutprand and the Lombard dukes bribes if they would abandon Pope Gregory. Despite all of this, according to Jeffrey Richards, Pope Gregory persisted in his efforts to preserve imperial rule in Italy.. Eutychius's efforts eventually gained results: King Liutprand came to an agreement with the Exarch, and agreed to support him in return for assistance in subjecting the duchies of Benevento and Spoleto. Pope Gregory, however, met with Liutprand, and convinced him to abandon the effort, then with Liutprand's help effected a reconciliation with Eutychius. When one Tiberius Petasius proclaimed himself emperor in Tuscia and Eutychius found himself critically short of manpower, Pope Gregory ordered the Roman army to help him put down the rebellion, and Petasius was killed.. Exile and appeal for help Conflict with the Lombards resulted in disaster in 737, when the exarchate's capital, Ravenna, was seized by Liutprand. Further warfare erupted in 739. Pope Gregory III had supported the dukes of Benevento and Spoleto against Liutprand, causing the latter to invade central Italy. The exarchate, as well as the Duchy of Rome, was ravaged and Ravenna fell to the Lombards; Eutychius was forced to go to the Venetian islands. He appealed to the inhabitants to help liberate Ravenna, and the Venetian fleet sailed with him to recover the city.. Papal Intervention in Ravenna Shortly after the accession of Pope Zachary in 741, Liutprand planned to campaign against the Lombard Duchy of Spoleto, which had defied him. Zachary, however, marched north to the Lombard capital of Pavia and convinced Liutprand to abort the expedition and to restore some of the territory he had captured.. Nevertheless, Liutprand saw this treaty as between him and the Pope alone; in the words of Jeffrey Richards, \\"he still regarded the exarch as fair game.\\" In 743, Liutprand marched on Ravenna, and Eutychius was so impoverished in resources that he, Archbishop John V of Ravenna, and the leading citizens petitioned the pope to intervene. Pope Zachary began a diplomatic offensive to dissuade Liutprand from conquering Ravenna, and on his journey to the Lombard court at Ticinum, he was met at the church of St. Christopher at Aquila by Exarch Eutychius and citizens of Ravenna. \\"The sight of the exarch begging the pope to save him from the Lombards testifies more powerfully than anything else to the utter enfeeblement of the exarchate and the effective transfer of authority in Catholic Byzantine Italy from the imperial governor to the pope,\\" observes Richards.. Pope Zachary was successful in convincing Liutprand to put off his intended campaign and return the rural districts around Ravenna he had seized. Fall of the Exarchate Several years later, however, in 751, the Lombard king Aistulf captured Ravenna. The Exarchate came to an end, and Byzantine Italy was confined to Sicily and the southern, Greek-speaking regions.

They resemble wolf spiders (Lycosidae) except for several key differences. Wolf spiders have two very prominent eyes in addition to the other six, while a nursery web spider's eyes are all about the same size. Additionally, female nursery web spiders carry their egg sacs with their jaws and pedipalps instead of attaching them to their spinnerets as wolf spiders do. When the eggs are about to hatch, a female spider builds a nursery \\"tent\\", places her egg sac inside, and stands guard outside, hence the family's common name. Like the wolf spiders, however, the nursery web spiders are roaming hunters that don't use webs for catching prey. They have a wide variety of prey, and larger species may prey upon vertebrates, particularly amphibians and fish. Species occur throughout the world except for extremely dry or cold environments, and are common just about everywhere. Many can walk on the surface of still bodies of water and may even dive beneath the surface temporarily to escape enemies. They can jump a distance of , but they have trouble climbing extremely smooth surfaces such as glass. The name \\"nursery web spider\\" is especially given to the European species Pisaura mirabilis, but this family also includes fishing spiders and raft spiders. Adult specimens may reach up to 15mm in length, including legs. The legs of the male are longer in relation to body size than those of the female. The female spider sometimes attempts to eat the male after mating. The male, to reduce the risk of this, often presents the female with a gift such as a fly when approaching in the hope that this will satisfy her hunger. Sometimes, this gift is a fake present intended to fool the female.Male Spiders Scam Females with Gift- Wrapped Garbage Males may wrap the fake gift in silk, to deceive the female to mate. Females can detect the fake gift and terminate mating, negating the male's deception in not giving a real gift.

Founded in 1826, MC is the second-oldest Baptist-affiliated college in the United States and the oldest college in Mississippi. With more than 5,000 students, Mississippi College is the largest private university in the state. History =Founding= Provine Chapel On January 24, 1826, the college received its first charter, signed by Mississippi Gov. David Holmes. In 1827 the name was changed from Hampstead Academy to Mississippi Academy at the request of the Board of Trustees. On December 18, 1830, having become a college, the name was changed to Mississippi College. It offered degrees in arts, sciences and languages. As a private institution in 1831, Mississippi College became the first coeducational college in the United States to award a degree to a female student. That year it granted degrees to two women, Alice Robinson and Catherine Hall. In the beginning Mississippi College was not church-related. For a number of years, it was affiliated with the Methodist and Presbyterian churches. Since 1850, Mississippi College has been affiliated with the Mississippi Baptist Convention and the Board of Trustees oversees the institution. =Civil War and reconstruction= Classes were not held during the Civil War, and the buildings deteriorated. Many students joined with faculty, a school trustee and townspeople to form the Mississippi College Rifles during the war years or signed up with other units. In the half-century after the war the college enrollment and campus slowly recovered, but its neglected buildings were not significantly damaged by the war. College President Walter Hillman helped refurbish the buildings by securing Northern financing prior to being offered the college presidency.Howell, Walter. (2014). Town and Gown: The Saga of Clinton and Mississippi College. Clinton: Privately printed by McNaughton & Gunn. pp. 149-150. email: walter- howell@comcast.net The endowment fund was renewed and the physical structures were renovated. From 1911 through 1932 the college prospered, seeing the completion of the Provine Science Building as well as Lowrey Hall, Alumni Hall and Farr-Hall Hospital, among others. The college endowment grew to $500,000 and in 1922, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools approved accreditation for the college. Enrollment reached 400 students. =World War II and later 20th century= In 1942, Mississippi College acquired Hillman College. A new Nelson Hall administration building was erected in 1948, and new residence halls were built. Nelson Hall In 1943, MC was among 131 colleges and universities nationwide taking part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy Commission. During the V-12 period, the Navy had exclusive use of Chrestman, Alumni Hall and the cafeteria. The last surge of construction during this era was a building for a growing fine arts program and a library. The war years saw enrollment in the 550-600 range. With veterans returning from World War II, enrollment increased. There were 1,000 students by 1950 and there were 1,581 students by Fall 1956. From 1957 through 1968 the college built the B.C. Rogers Student Center, Hederman Science Building, Self Hall and a pair of residence halls. Provine Chapel was restored. The School of Nursing began in 1969. With the coming of the School of Law in 1975, when MC purchased the former Jackson School of Law, the college took another step toward a university structure. In 1975, the division of business became the School of Business. In 1977 the division of education became the School of Education. In 1982, twelve remaining departments were grouped into the College of Arts and Sciences. In May 1992 MC absorbed Clarke College after the smaller school was forced to close due to declining enrollments. Throughout the 1990s the college renovated and expanded: work was carried out on the library, electronic media center, Cockroft Hall (for the School of Nursing), A.E. Wood Coliseum, the Law School building in downtown Jackson, the New Men's Residence Hall, the New Women's Residence Hall, Jennings Hall and Latimer House (a Victorian house later used for alumni receptions). =21st century= From 2002 to 2015 the college's enrollment grew from 3,227 to 5,152, an increase of 60%. The number includes a record of 618 freshmen. The number of international students rose from nine to a record 505 students from more than two dozen nations in Fall 2015. The college added a physician assistant program in 2011, becoming the first institution in Mississippi to offer such a degree. MC now offers doctorates in educational leadership and professional counseling. MC emphasizes public service. In 2011‚Äì2012 students, faculty and staff performed more than 45,000 hours of community service at 153 different agencies, while the campus hosted Centrifuge and Super Summer camps. =Presidents= Since its beginning, Mississippi College has had 23 presidents/principals, including three interim presidents. The first three presidents were known as Principals, before changing the official title to President. * F. G. Hopkins (1826 to 1828) * Daniel Comfort (1828 to 1834) * N. Shepherd (1835 to 1836) * E.

The Mississippi College School of Law is located in downtown Jackson. Classes are also offered on Saturday mornings. Notable buildings at Mississippi College include its historic Provine Chapel that opened in 1860 and is the oldest building on the Clinton campus. During the Civil War, U.S. General Ulysses S. Grant used it as a hospital for his wounded troops and reports say it was also used as a stable for his horses. Opened in 1926, Alumni Hall houses a gymnasium used for intramural basketball games, and a large pool used for water aerobics by students, faculty and staff. Built in 1948, Nelson Hall serves as the university's administration building and contains Swor Auditorium, the venue for concerts and other musical performances. Aven Hall houses the recitals at the Jean Pittman Williams Recital Hall and some theatre performances in the Aven Little Theater. The Samuel Marshall Gore Galleries hosts fine art exhibitions. The A.E. Wood Coliseum is used for MC Choctaws basketball games as well as serving as the site for university graduations. Self Hall houses the MC School of Business and Lowrey Hall, the former MC library, serves as the home of the School of Education. The modern Leland Speed Library houses books, audiotapes, computers, study rooms, meeting rooms and its Learning Resources Center that includes studios for the Department of Communication to videotape events on campus. The 20,000-square-foot Royce Medical Science Center, named in honor of President Emeritus Lee G. Royce, opened in January 2013 and contains a cadaver lab, research facilities and new classrooms. The 106,000-square-foot Baptist Healthplex serves the health and fitness needs of faculty, staff, students, alumni and Jackson area residents. The Healthplex also contains medical offices serving the community and is home of MC's Physician Assistant Program. The School of Law building in downtown Jackson serves more than 500 law students each year. Cockroft Hall houses the nursing and kinesiology departments. The B.C. Rogers Student Center includes the campus cafeteria, meeting rooms for large functions, such as Anderson Hall, and office space for organizations including the Baptist Student Union. The 8,500-seat Robinson- Hale Stadium is the home field for MC Choctaws football games and track meets on the Clinton campus. University Place residence halls opened in August 2015 to accommodate 189 students. Cost of the eight modern brick units was $16 million. The facilities represent the first new residence hall construction in nearly 20 years on the Clinton campus.

UMMC, also referred to as the Medical Center, is the state's only academic medical center. UMMC houses seven health science schools: Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Health Related Professions, Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences, Population Health and Pharmacy. (The main School of Pharmacy is headquartered on the University of Mississippi (UM) campus in Oxford, Mississippi.) The 164-acre campus also includes University Hospital, Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants, Conerly Critical Care Hospital, Batson Children's Hospital, the state's only children's hospital, and Rowland Medical Library. As the academic health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi, the Medical Center functions as a separately accredited, semi-autonomous unit responsible to the chancellor of the university and through him to the constitutional Board of Trustees of the State Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL). The University of Mississippi Medical Center is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, master's and doctorate degrees. The Medical Center also is accredited by The Joint Commission. The IHL Board of Trustees appoints the UM chancellor, who then recommends a candidate for UMMC's vice chancellor for health affairs. The vice chancellor also serves as the dean of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. LouAnn Woodward, MD, was named March 1, 2015, to fill the vice chancellor position. She is responsible for the overall strategic direction of the Medical Center. She is the first woman and the 10th person to hold the post in the Medical Center's 60-year history. Enrollment in UMMC's 28 degree programs is more than 2,900 students. Admission preference is given to Mississippi residents in an effort to supply professionals to meet the state's health-care needs. The Associated Student Body (ASB) is the student government association for UMMC. It serves as a mechanism to organize student extracurricular activities and to voice student concerns, ideas, and questions to the administration and community. UMMC is the only hospital in the state designated as a Level 1 trauma center. Specialized hospital services include: an interventional MRI; the only Level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the state; separate medical, surgical, cardiac, neuroscience and pediatric ICUs; a heart station for diagnosis and treatment of heart disease; a heart failure clinic; heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, cornea and bone marrow transplant programs; a comprehensive stroke unit; state-of-the-art radiological imaging systems; a sleep disorders laboratory; an in vitro fertilization program; and special pharmaceutical services. A portion of land on the UMMC campus was once the site of the Mississippi Insane Asylum, which moved its operations in 1935 and became Mississippi State Hospital. Medical facilities UMMC has the only hospital in the state designated as a Level 1 trauma center, and the state's only Level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) located in the Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants. The Medical Center also has the only organ transplant (adult and pediatric) program and OB/GYN emergency room in Mississippi. With a total of 1,003 beds, including Holmes County and Grenada locations, UMMC is the largest diagnostic, treatment and referral care system in the state. Based on the latest fiscal year (2013‚Äì14) statistics, inpatient admissions at the multiple locations totaled more than 33,000, with more than 487,000 hospital outpatient visits. The UMMC emergency rooms in Jackson had 70,000 visits, while Grenada had 18,324 and Holmes County had 6,657. Hospitals include: * University Hospital * Wallace Conerly Critical Care Hospital * Winfred L. Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants * Blair E. Batson Children's Hospital * UMMC Holmes County * UMMC Grenada University Physicians (UP), the faculty group practice of the School of Medicine, includes about 500 doctors in the university hospitals and in clinics on campus, around the Jackson metro area, and in outreach clinics around the state. UP providers see about 404,870 patients each year in 170 locations in 38 counties. UMMC faculty and advanced practice providers see patients at several on- and off-site clinics. Specialized clinics include: * UP Pavilion ‚Äì Jackson, Miss. * UP Grants Ferry ‚Äì Flowood, Miss. * UP Lakeland Medicine Center ‚Äì Jackson, Miss * UP Northeast Jackson at Select Specialty Hospital ‚Äì Jackson, Miss. * Women's Specialty Care at Mirror Lake ‚Äì Flowood, Miss. * The Face & Skin Center of University Physicians ‚Äì Ridgeland, Miss. * UMMC Cancer Institute at Jackson Medical Mall ‚Äì Jackson, Miss. * UP Clinics at Jackson Medical Mall ‚Äì Jackson, Miss.

In 2007, professional football standout Eli Manning undertook a five-year campaign to improve Batson's pediatric clinics. More than $2.9 million was raised, and the clinics were renamed Eli Manning Children's Clinics. In 2014, father Archie Manning and his family joined with UMMC to launch the Manning Family Fund for a Healthier Mississippi. The donor-supported program boosts the Medical Center's commitment to improving Mississippians‚Äô health. The partnership between the Mannings and UMMC raises money to attack heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, dementia and other health challenges confronting Mississippians. UMMC outreach programs help fulfill the Medical Center's mission of improving the overall health of Mississippians. Efforts range from volunteer and pastoral services at UMMC to statewide emergency medical responses and state-sponsored outreach initiatives. Centers and institutes UMMC is the home for a variety of specialized health-care, research and education centers and institutes, including: * Cancer Institute * Myrlie Evers-Williams Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities * ACT Center for Tobacco Treatment, Education and Research * Cardiovascular-Renal Research Center * Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities * Center for Developmental Disorders Research * Center for Psychiatric Neuroscience * Center for Sialendoscopy and Salivary Gland Disorders * Center for Telehealth * Center of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics * Children's Cancer Center * Children's Safe Center * Comprehensive Epilepsy Center * Comprehensive Stroke Center * Memory Impairment and Neurodegenerative Dementia Center * Mississippi Center for Obesity Research * Women's Health Research Center * Clinical Skills Assessment Center * Simulation and Interprofessional Education Center Center for Telehealth In 2003, UMMC helped start a pilot program to connect emergency physicians in Jackson with three rural hospitals using telecommunications. The program has now grown into the Center for Telehealth, which ranks among the top programs in the nation. Telehealth, also known as telemedicine, uses remote technologies to provide services ranging from diabetes counseling to remote monitoring of intensive care patients. UMMC's telehealth program functions as a virtual clinic performing direct medical diagnostics and treatment from physicians, specialists and nurses. It averages 8,000 consultations a month. In 2015, UMMC and data company Venyu Solutions (acquired by EATEL in 2013) partnered to expand the Medical Center's telehealth services. The 40,000 square foot UMMC Center for Telehealth Venyu Technology Campus is being constructed by Duvall Decker Architects, in Jackson, Mississippi, and is recognized by an AIA Mississippi Award Citation. Affiliated entities Separate entities are affiliated with UMMC because of services they provide in support of the Medical Center. They include: * Children's Miracle Network * UMMC Alliance * University Transplant Guild Aircare Flight Service The University of Mississippi Medical Center's Helicopter Flight program began operations in 1996 with a single helicopter based in Jackson. The Jackson-based AirCare 1 helicopter was joined by the Meridian-based AirCare 2 helicopter in spring 2009, the Golden Triangle-based AirCare 3 in spring 2016, and Greenwood-based Aircare 4 in 2017. The additional helicopters allowed AirCare to expand its mission profile by transporting patients to not only UMMC, but other hospitals able to provide levels of care required by the patient's illness or injury. Scene response profile has also changed, allowing the transportation of multiple patients from a single location. Since the program's inception, AirCare teams have safely transported over 18,000 adults, pediatric and neonatal patients over 2 million miles without any FAA-reportable accidents as of 2016. Economic impact With more than 9,000 full- and part-time employees, UMMC is one of the largest employers in Mississippi. Its annual budget ‚Äì approximately one- tenth from state appropriations ‚Äì represents 10 percent of the Jackson metro area economy and 2 percent of the state economy. On any given weekday, about 20,000 employees, students, patients, family members, vendors and other guests are present on the UMMC campus. History The University of Mississippi Medical Center opened in 1955, but its beginnings date to 1903 when a two-year medical school was established on the parent campus in Oxford. In that era, certificate graduates went out of state to complete their doctor of medicine degrees. University Medical Center, circa 1950 Finally, in 1950, the Mississippi Legislature enacted a law to create a four-year medical school associated with the University of Mississippi. On July 1, 1955, the state's new Medical Center, then commonly referred to as UMC, opened in Jackson, initially as a four-year medical school with medical and graduate students, interns and residents. As it had in Oxford, the School of Medicine offered both medical and graduate degree programs. The campus included a teaching hospital and a library. The Oxford campus' nursing department moved to the Medical Center in 1956 and was granted school status in 1958. The School of Health Related Professions (SHRP) was added in 1971 and began offering baccalaureate curricula in 1973. The School of Dentistry was authorized in 1973, and its first students were admitted in 1975. The graduate program was elevated to school status in 2001 and designated the School of Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences. The parcel of land on which UMMC's University Hospital sits was once the site of the Mississippi Insane Asylum, which moved its operations in 1935 to Whitfield, Miss., and became Mississippi State Hospital. The bodies of perhaps seven thousand patients have been found on campus in unmarked graves.  Institutional leadership  * Dr. David S.

In 1963, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was rushed to UMMC after being shot at his home in Jackson, MS, but he died in the hospital emergency room. In 1964, UMMC became the primary medical provider for injured Freedom Riders. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited federally funded institutions from discriminating. In 1965, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a federal civil rights complaint against UMMC. Robert Q. Marston, MD, then medical dean and Medical Center director, developed a compliance strategy which included hiring the first black faculty member, and integrating the hospitals and clinics. At about the same time, Dr. Blair E. Batson, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at UMMC, offered a position in the department's residency education program to Dr. Aaron Shirley, an African- American physician who had attended medical school in Tennessee. Shirley became the first African-American learner at UMMC when he entered the residency program in 1965. Notable alumni *Jim C.

At the time of his birth he was the fourth in line to the throne. A Cambridge and Stanford graduate, he joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, serving in Lagos and Tokyo, before returning to take over royal duties. He led an active life, flying Piper aircraft, trekking through the Sahara, and even ballooning. He remains the most recent descendant of George III to be diagnosed with porphyria, probably hereditary, which is widely believed to be the illness that most likely caused George III's mental breakdown. Prince William died in 1972, aged 30, in an air crash while piloting his plane in a competition. Early life William as a young boy in Canberra in 1946, with his parents (far left and far right) and Lord and Lady Louis Mountbatten Prince William was born at Hadley Common,Royal Children by Charles Kidd & Patrick Montague-Smith Hertfordshire. His father was Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the third son of George V and Queen Mary. His mother was Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, the third daughter of the 7th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Margaret Bridgeman. He was baptised in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle on 22 February 1942 by Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury. His godparents were George VI (his paternal uncle), Queen Mary (his paternal grandmother), Princess Helena Victoria (his cousin), Lady Margaret Hawkins (his maternal aunt), Major Lord William Montagu Douglas Scott (his maternal uncle) and Lord Gort, who was unable to attend. Because of the war, newspapers did not identify the actual location of the christening, and said instead that it took place at \\"a private chapel in the country\\".The Times, 23 February 1942 At the time of his birth, and for months afterwards, Prince Henry was away on military duties, some of which meant considerable risk. This prompted George VI to write to his sister-in-law, promising that, if anything should happen to his brother, he would become Prince William's guardian. In 1947, Prince William was a page boy for his cousin Princess Elizabeth at her wedding to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The other page boy was Prince Michael of Kent. In 1953, he attended the coronation of Elizabeth II. Prince William spent his early childhood at Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire and later in Canberra, Australia, where his father served as Governor-General from 1945 to 1947. After returning to England, he received his education at Wellesley House School, a prep school at Broadstairs in Kent, then at Eton College, where he achieved mention in the Eton College Chronicle for his performance in junior cricket and achieved house colours for football. After leaving Eton in 1960, he went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to read history, graduating with a BA degree in 1963, subsequently raised to an MA (Cantab.) degree in 1968. After Cambridge, he spent a post-baccalaureate year at Stanford University, studying political science, American history, and business. Career After returning to Britain, he took a position with Lazards, a merchant bank. Prince William was the second member of the British royal family to work in the civil service or the diplomatic service (the first was his uncle, Prince George, Duke of Kent, in the 1920s). He joined the Commonwealth Office in 1965 and was posted to Lagos as the third secretary at the British High Commission. In 1968, he transferred to Tokyo as second secretary (commercial) in the British Embassy. By 1970, the health of his father, the Duke of Gloucester, had become critical after further strokes. William had no choice but to resign from the diplomatic service and return to Britain in order to take care of his father's estate and, as he put it, take on the full time job of a royal prince. On his way back, he represented the Queen at the celebrations to mark the termination of Tonga's status as a protected state. For the next two years, he managed Barnwell Manor and began to carry out public duties as a member of the royal family. Apart from taking over many engagements his father could no longer perform, William took particular interest in St John Ambulance, where he became increasingly active. He was also President of National Ski Federation Supporters' Association, the Magdalene Society (Cambridge), the East Midlands Tourist Board, and the Royal African Society. His patronages included the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain, the British Schools Exploring Society and the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society. Prince William served on some occasions as Counsellor of State in the absence of his cousin, the Queen. Personal life Shortly before transferring to Tokyo in August 1968, Prince William was examined by a Royal Air Force doctor, Headly Bellringer, at the request of the prince's mother. William told the doctor that he had suffered from jaundice, beginning in December 1965 and lasting several months. He had subsequently noticed that his skin was prone to a blistering rash, particularly on exposure to sunshine. Bellringer tentatively diagnosed porphyria, prescribed sunblock cream and gave him a medical warning card regarding the need to avoid certain medications. Although he was aware of the theory of the royal family's history of porphyria then being proposed by Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter, he stated he \\"tried not to let it influence him...with all the symptoms, I was left with little option but to diagnose the Prince's condition as porphyria.\\" William was later examined by haematologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and also by a Professor Ishihara in Tokyo, both of whom also concluded he was suffering from variegate porphyria, by then in remission. A member of the British royal family being reliably diagnosed with porphyria added credence to the theory‚Äîfirst proposed by Professor Macalpine in the late 1960s‚Äîthat porphyria was the source of the ill-health of both Mary, Queen of Scots (an ancestor of both of William's parents) and of George III, and that the disorder had been inherited by some members of the royal families of the UK, Prussia and several German duchies and principalities. Former model and stewardess Zsuzsi Starkloff said in a Daily Mail interview in 2012 that William had a long-standing relationship with her and wanted to marry her. According to Starkloff, the two met in Japan in 1968. She speculates that because she was twice divorced and a mother of two small children, William's family refused to acknowledge or accept their relationship, and that Starkloff met with displeasure from courtiers because she was Jewish and Hungarian. According to Starkloff, William continued a relationship with her until his accidental death in 1972, but the last time they met in person was in August 1970. The relationship with Zsuzsi Starkloff was further explored in the 2015 Channel 4 TV documentary, The Other Prince William. Despite the alleged reluctance of senior members of the royal family to take William's relationship with Starkloff seriously, the standards regarding marriage in the royal family at the time were no longer as strict as they had been. Princess Margaret, while not encouraging William, did sympathize with him of this regard, telling him to \\"wait a bit\\" and to \\"see how everything looks\\" once he returned to Britain. Furthermore, once back in England, Starkloff went to stay with William's family at Barnwell Manor, where his parents were kind and accommodating to her. While William's intentions regarding his relationship with Starkloff are unclear, marriage was probably not one of them. In the year of his death, he gave an interview to Audrey Whiting for the Sunday Mirror, in which he declared that if he ever married, he would do so to a woman not only right for him, but right in \\"the eyes of other members of the Family\\". In the early 1970s, Prince William began a relationship with Nicole Sieff (n√©e Moschietto). She had two sons with her ex-husband, Jonathan Sieff. She laid a wreath at Prince William's funeral. The prince is consistently described by friends as adventurous (almost to the point of recklessness), warm, tender and extremely generous. But of all his qualities, the one most often mentioned is that of loyalty to his friends. One account describes how William was particularly kind to friends who were either \\"ill, unpopular with others, or even downright embarrassing\\". His status and circumstances had also influenced his personality and he could, at times, be \\"tiresomely selfish\\". Regarding his family, Prince William considered himself extremely lucky compared to other members of the royal family. He had a very close relationship with both his parents, especially with his mother of whom he said, \\"She is a human being and she must possess some faults. But so far as I am concerned she has no faults at all\\". He was also very fond of his father, one friend describing William's love and tenderness for him as \\"infectious\\". William acknowledged his father couldn't have been very happy as a young man, as a result of the strict upbringing he had received, so he was very grateful to him for the freedom he had given him throughout his life. Death A licensed pilot and President of the British Light Aviation Centre,Report by Adam Burling, Comment and Analysis. Prince William owned several aircraft and competed in amateur air show races. On 28 August 1972, he was competing in the Goodyear International Air Trophy at Halfpenny Green, near Wolverhampton, with Vyrell Mitchell‚Äîa pilot with whom the prince had often raced‚Äîlisted as a passenger. Shortly after their takeoff and at a very low altitude, the Piper Cherokee banked abruptly to port, with an extreme increase in the rate of turn and corresponding loss of altitude; the wing hit a tree and sheared off, and the out-of-control plane flipped over and crashed into an earthen bank, bursting into flames. Prince William and Mitchell were killed. The crash happened before 30,000 spectators, the fire took two hours to control, and the bodies were identified at inquest the next day from dental records. His father, Prince Henry, was in such poor health at the time of his death that his mother hesitated whether to tell him. She later admitted in her memoirs that she did not, but that he may have learned of their son's death from television coverage. Prince William was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore.

It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Peanut butter is popular in many countries. The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter and itself consumes $800 million of peanut butter annually. Peanut butter is served as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers, and used to make sandwiches (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used in a number of breakfast dishes and desserts, such as peanut-flavored granola, smoothies, crepes, cookies, brownies, or croissants. It is similar to other nut butters such as cashew butter and almond butter. History Patent for peanut butter The use of peanuts dates to the Aztecs and Incas. Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, obtained a patent for a method of producing peanut butter from roasted peanuts using heated surfaces in 1884. Edson's cooled product had \\"a consistency like that of butter, lard, or ointment\\" according to his patent application which described a process of milling roasted peanuts until the peanuts reached \\"a fluid or semi-fluid state\\". He mixed sugar into the paste to harden its consistency. A businessman from St. Louis named George Bayle produced and sold peanut butter in the form of a snack food in 1894. An antique Shedd's Peanut Butter tin. Shedd was an American brand which was discontinued in the 1980s. John Harvey Kellogg, known for his line of prepared breakfast cereals, was issued a patent for a \\"Process of Producing Alimentary Products\\" in 1898, and used peanuts, although he boiled the peanuts rather than roasting them. Kellogg's Western Health Reform Institute served peanut butter to patients because they needed a food that contained a lot of protein, yet which could be eaten without chewing. At first, peanut butter was a food for wealthy people, as it became popular initially as a product served at expensive health care institutes. Early peanut-butter-making machines were developed by Joseph Lambert, who had worked at John Harvey Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium, and Dr. Ambrose Straub who obtained a patent for a peanut- butter-making machine in 1903. \\"In 1922, chemist Joseph Rosefield invented a process for making smooth peanut butter that kept the oil from separating by using partially hydrogenated oil; Rosefield \\"...licensed his invention to the company that created Peter Pan peanut butter\\" in 1928 and in \\"...1932 he began producing his own peanut butter under the name Skippy\\". Under the Skippy brand, Rosefield developed a new method of churning creamy peanut butter, giving it a smoother consistency. He also mixed fragments of peanut into peanut butter, creating the first \\"chunky\\"-style peanut butter. In 1955, Procter & Gamble launched a peanut butter named Jif, which was sweeter than other brands, due to the use of \\"sugar and molasses\\" in its recipe. A slang term for peanut butter in World War II was \\"monkey butter\\". A Meal Ready to Eat or \\"MRE kit\\" which contains peanut butter packets. As the US National Peanut Board confirms, \\"Contrary to popular belief, George Washington Carver did not invent peanut butter.\\" Carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab. By the time Carver published his document about peanuts, entitled \\"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it For Human Consumption\\" in 1916,\\"George Washington Carver\\" , National Peanut Board. many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists, doctors, and food scientists working in the US and Canada. January 24 is National Peanut Butter Day in the United States. Types and labeling Jars of Jif brand \\"creamy\\" and \\"extra crunchy\\" peanut butter. The two main types of peanut butter are crunchy (or chunky) and smooth (or creamy). In crunchy peanut butter, some coarsely-ground peanut fragments are included to give extra texture. The peanuts in smooth peanut butter are ground uniformly, creating a creamy texture. In the US, food regulations require that any product labeled \\"peanut butter\\" must contain at least 90% peanuts; the remaining <10% usually consists of \\"...salt, a sweetener, and an emulsifier or hardened vegetable oil which prevents the peanut oil from separating\\". In the US, no product labelled as \\"peanut butter\\" can contain \\"artificial sweeteners, chemical preservatives, [or] natural or artificial coloring additives.\\" Some brands of peanut butter are sold without emulsifiers that bind the peanut oils with the peanut paste, and so require stirring after separation. Most major brands of peanut butter add white sugar, but there are others that use dried cane syrup, agave syrup, or coconut palm sugar. In the Netherlands peanut butter is called pindakaas (literally \\"peanut cheese\\") rather than pindaboter (\\"peanut butter\\") because the word butter was a legally protected term for products that contain actual butter, prompting Calv√©, the company which first marketed it in the country in 1948, to use kaas instead. = Artisan peanut butter = Organic and artisanal peanut butters are available, but their markets are small. Artisan peanut butter is usually preservative-free, additive-free, and handmade in a cottage industry-style setup. Jesse Frank Ford of Arrowhead Mills in 1970 became one of the first producers to start making peanut butter with organically grown Valencia peanuts. Ford's goal was to grow peanuts by sustainable means, without pesticides, and without mass-grinding grains. Since Arrowhead Mills was sold to the Hain Celestial Group in 1999, the peanut butter has been reported to be no different to other peanut butter companies' products. Production process =Planting and harvesting= A tractor being used to complete the first stage of the peanut harvesting process Due to weather conditions, peanuts are usually planted in spring. The peanut comes from a yellow flower that bends over and infiltrates the soil after blooming and wilting, and the peanut starts to grow in the soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos. =Shelling= Shelling must be conducted carefully lest the seeds are damaged during the removal of the shell. The moisture of the unshelled peanuts is controlled to avoid excessive frangibility of the shells and kernels, which in turn, reduces the amount of dust present in the plant. After, the peanuts are sent to a series of rollers set specifically for the batch of peanuts, where they are cracked. After cracking, the peanuts go through a screening process where they are inspected for contaminants. =Roasting= The dry roasting process employs either the batch or continuous method. In the batch method, peanuts are heated in large quantities in a revolving oven at about . Next, the peanuts in each batch are uniformly held and roasted in the oven at for about 40 to 60 minutes. This method is good to use when the peanuts differ in moisture content. In the continuous method, a hot air roaster is employed. The peanuts pass through the roaster whilst being rocked to permit even roasting. A photometer indicates the completion of dry roasting. This method is favored by large manufacturers since it can lower the rate of spoilage and requires less labor. =Cooling= After dry roasting, peanuts are removed from the oven as quickly as possible and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder. There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling can help retain some oil and moisture. The cooling process is completed when the temperature in the cylinder reaches . =Blanching= After the kernels have been cooled down, the peanuts will undergo either heat blanching or water blanching to remove the remaining seed coats. Compared to heat blanching, water blanching is a new process. Water blanching first appeared in 1949.  Heat blanching  Peanuts are heated by hot air at for not more than 20 minutes in order to soften and split the skins. After that, the peanuts are exposed to continuous steam in a blanching machine. The skins are then removed using either bristles or soft rubber belts. After that, these skins are separated and blown into waste bags. Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.  Water blanching  After the kernels are arranged in troughs, the skin of the kernel is cracked on opposite sides by rolling it through sharp stationary blades. While the skins are removed, the kernels are brought through a one- minute hot water bath and placed on a swinging pad with canvas on top. The swinging action of the pad rubs off the skins. Afterward, the blanched kernels are dried for at least six hours by hot air at . After blanching, the peanuts are screened and inspected to eliminate the burnt and rotten peanuts. A blower is also used to remove light peanuts and discolored peanuts are removed using a color sorting machine. =Grinding= After blanching the peanuts are sent to grinding to be manufactured into peanut butter. The peanuts are then sent through two sizes of grinders. The first grinder produces a medium grind, and the second produces a fine grind. At this point, salt, sugar and a vegetable oil stabilizer are added to the fine grind to produce the peanut butter. This adds flavor and allows the peanut butter to stay as a homogenous mixture. Chopped peanuts may also be added at this stage to produce ‚Äúchunky‚Äù peanut butter. =Packaging= Before packaging, the peanut butter must first be cooled in order to be sealed in jars. The mixture is pumped into a heat exchanger in order to cool it to about . Once cool, the peanut butter is pumped into jars and vacuum-sealed. This vacuum sealing rids the container of oxygen so that oxidation cannot occur, preserving the food. The jars are then labeled and set aside until crystallization occurs. The peanut butter is then packaged into cartons distributed to retailers, where they are stored at room temperature and sold to consumers. A 2012 article stated that \\"China and India are the first and second-largest producers, respectively\\", of peanuts. The United States of America \\"...is the third-largest producer of peanuts (Georgia and Texas are the two major peanut-producing states)\\" and \\"more than half of the American peanut crop goes into making peanut butter.\\" Health =Nutritional profile= In a 100 gram amount, smooth peanut butter supplies 588 Calories and is composed of 50% fat, 25% protein, 20% carbohydrates (including 6% dietary fiber), and 2% water (table). Peanut butter is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber, vitamin E, pantothenic acid, niacin, and vitamin B6 (table, USDA National Nutrient Database). Also high in content are the dietary minerals manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and copper (table). Peanut butter is a moderate source (10‚Äì19% DV) of thiamin, iron, and potassium (table). Both crunchy/chunky and smooth peanut butter are sources of saturated (primarily palmitic acid, 21% of total fat) and monounsaturated fats, mainly oleic acid as 47% of total fat, and polyunsaturated fat (28% of total fat), primarily as linoleic acid). =Peanut allergy= For people with a peanut allergy, peanut butter can cause a variety of possible allergic reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. This potential effect has led to banning peanut butter, among other common foods, in some schools. Symptoms * Shortness of breath * Wheezing * Tightening of the throat * Itching * Skin reactions such as hives and swelling * Digestive problems Uses Peanut butter cookies, a popular type of cookie made from peanut butter and other ingredients =As an ingredient= Buckeyes, a type of peanut-butter-based confectionery product. Peanut butter is included as an ingredient in many recipes: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, peanut butter cookies, and candies where peanut is the main flavor, such as Reese's Pieces, or various peanut butter and chocolate treats, such as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and the Crispy Crunch candy bar. Peanut butter's flavor combines well with other flavors, such as oatmeal, cheese, cured meats, savory sauces, and various types of breads and crackers. The creamy or crunchy, fatty, salty taste pairs very well with complementary soft and sweet ingredients like fruit preserves, bananas, apples, and honey. The taste can also be enhanced by similarly salty things like bacon (see peanut butter, banana, and bacon sandwich), especially if the peanut butter has added sweetness. One snack for children is called \\"Ants on a Log\\", with a celery stick acting as the \\"log\\". The groove in the celery stick is filled with peanut butter and raisins arranged in a row along the top are \\"ants\\". Plumpy'nut is a peanut butter-based food used to fight malnutrition in famine- stricken countries. A single pack contains 500 calories, can be stored unrefrigerated for 2 years, and requires no cooking or preparation. =As animal food= Peanut butter inside a hollow chew toy is a method to occupy a dog with a favored treat. A common outdoor bird feeder is a coating of peanut butter on a pine cone with an overlying layer of birdseed.

Roux is typically made from equal parts of flour and fat by weight. The flour is added to the melted fat or oil on the stove top, blended until smooth, and cooked to the desired level of brownness. Butter, bacon drippings or lard are commonly used fats. Roux is used as a thickening agent for gravy, sauces, soups and stews. It provides the base for a dish, and other ingredients are added after the roux is complete.  Uses  The fat is most often butter in French cuisine, but may be lard or vegetable oil in other cuisines. The roux is used in three of the five mother sauces of classical French cooking: b√©chamel sauce, velout√© sauce, and espagnole sauce. In Cajun cuisine, roux is made with bacon fat or oil instead of butter and cooked to a medium or dark brown color, which lends much richness of flavor, but makes it thinner. Central European cuisine often uses lard (in its rendered form) or more recently vegetable oil instead of butter for the preparation of roux, which is called in Slovak, in Czech, in Polish, () in Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, and Macedonian, () in Bulgarian, in Hungarian and in German. Japanese curry, or , is made from a roux made by frying yellow curry powder, butter or oil, and flour together. The French term has become a loanword in Japanese, , or more specifically . Roux (meyane) has been used in Ottoman and Turkish cuisine since at least the 15th century.  Methods  The fat is heated in a pot or pan, melting it if necessary. Then the flour is added. The mixture is heated and stirred until the flour is incorporated, and then cooked until at least the point where a raw flour taste is no longer apparent and the desired colour has been reached. The final colour can range from nearly white to nearly black, depending on the length of time it is heated and its intended use. The end result is a thickening and flavoring agent. Roux is most often made with butter as the fat base, but it may be made with any edible fat. For meat gravies, fat rendered from meat is often used. In regional American cuisine, bacon is sometimes rendered to produce fat to use in the roux. If clarified butter is not available, vegetable oil is often used when producing dark roux, since it does not burn at high temperatures, as whole butter would.  Types  Light (or \\"white\\") roux provides little flavor other than a characteristic richness to a dish, and is used in French cooking and some gravies or pastries throughout the world. Darker roux is made by browning the flour in oil for a longer time and add a distinct nutty flavor to a dish. They may be called \\"blond,\\" \\"peanut- butter,\\" \\"brown,\\" or \\"chocolate\\" roux depending on their color. The darker the color, the richer the flavor. Swabian (southwest German) cooking uses a darker roux for its \\"brown broth\\" (), which, in its simplest form, consists of nothing more than lard, flour, and water, with a bay leaf and salt for seasoning. Dark roux is often made with vegetable oils, which have a higher smoke point than butter, and are used in Cajun and Creole cuisine for gumbos and stews. The darker the roux, the less thickening power it has; a chocolate roux has about one-fourth the thickening power, by weight, of a white roux. A very dark roux, just shy of burning and turning black, has a distinctly reddish color and is sometimes referred to as \\"brick\\" roux. A dish of staka served as part of a meze, Souda, Crete = Cretan staka = Staka () is a type of roux particular to Cretan cuisine. It is prepared by cooking sheep milk cream over a low flame with wheat flour or starch: the protein-rich part of the butterfat coagulates with the flour or starch and forms the staka proper, which is served hot. It is generally eaten by dipping bread in it, occasionally served over French fries. The fatty part separates to form stakovoutyro, staka butter, which is kept for later use and has a faint cheesy flavor. Staka butter is used in Cretan pilaf (pil√°fi), commonly served at weddings. = Kurdish mirtoxe = Mirtoxe is another type of roux consumed in breakfast mainly by Kurds.  Alternatives  Cooks can substitute for roux by adding a mixture of cold water and wheat flour to a dish that needs thickening, since the heat of boiling water will release the starch from the flour; however, this temperature is not high enough to eliminate the floury taste. A mixture of water and flour used in this way is colloquially known as ‚Äúcowboy roux‚Äù, and in modern cuisine it is called a white wash. It is used infrequently in restaurant cooking, since it imparts a flavor to the finished dish that a traditional haute cuisine chef would consider unacceptable. Cornflour (known as cornstarch in the United States) can be used instead of wheat flour. Since less is needed to thicken, it imparts less of the raw flour taste, and it also makes the final sauce shinier. As an alternative to roux, which is high in fat and very energy-dense, some Creole chefs have experimented with toasting flour without oil in a hot pan as an addition to gumbo. Cornstarch mixed with water (slurry), arrowroot, and other agents can be used in place of roux as well. These items do not contribute to the flavor of a dish, and are used solely for thickening liquids. More recently, many chefs have turned to a group of naturally occurring chemicals known as hydrocolloids. In addition to being flavorless and possessing the ability to act as a thickening agent, the resulting texture is thought by some to be superior, and only a small amount is required for the desired effect.

The legion was disbanded in AD 70 by Emperor Vespasian. The legion symbols were a bull (as with all of Caesar's legions) and a capricorn.Legions and Veterans: Roman Army Papers 1971‚Äì2000 By L. J. F. Keppie page 128 Brick stamp LEG IV MAC found in Rheinzabern.  History  = Early history = This legion was probably founded in Italy in 48 BCE by Julius Caesar, who needed it in his war against Pompey. It saw its first action at Dyrrhachium. After the civil war the legion was stationed in Macedonia. The unit was supposed to serve in Caesar's campaign against the Parthian Empire. Unfortunately, the expedition was canceled after Ceaser's death. However, the failure of this campaign would not stop the legion from fighting, as another civil war would soon break out. Before the conflict erupted, the legion was moved to Italy by Mark Antony, although this did not deter them from siding with Augustus during the Battle of Mutina, where they fought against Antony and suffered heavy losses. In 42 BC, the legion fought at the Battle of Philippi and returned to the Italy with Augustus. They were subsequently present at the siege of Perugia in the winter of 41 BC, where Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's brother, had taken refuge. The legion was also present at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. = Cantabrian Wars = After Augustus became Emperor, in 30 BC it was moved to Hyspania Tarraconensis to fight the Cantabrian Wars. During the war the legion was stationed at Herrera de Pisuerga. After the war the soldiers continued to serve as civil servants in Hispania. = Early Service in Germania = Most likely Roman emperor Claudius transferred the legion to Mainz in Germania Superior. It is unknown when this happened although it was probably in 41 AD.It replaced XIV Gemina, which was now fighting in Britain. However. Some people think that the legion was transferred in 39 AD, when emperor Caligula waged war against the Germanic Chatti. While stationed in Germania the Fourth shared the fortress with the recently founded XXII Primigenia. The younger unit occupied the less honorable left-hand side, whereas IIII Macedonica was living in the right-hand side. = Year of Four Emperors = When the Year of Four Emperors occurred the Fourth legion and the Twenty-Second were the first to side with Vitellius. Many soldiers of the legion took part in Vitellius' march to Italy. It conquered the road through Switzerland, fought at Cremona against the troops of the emperor Otho. Several soldiers were rewarded for their service and transferred to the imperial guard. = Later service in Germania = Meanwhile, in Germania Inferior, the Batavians revolted. A Roman expeditionary force, consisting of the remains of V Alaudae and XV Primigenia, was defeated near Nijmegen, and not much later, these two legions found themselves besieged at Xanten. Although I Germanica, XVI Gallica and the other legion from Mainz, XXII Primigenia, tried to rescue them, they failed were forced to surrender. Not much later, I Germanica and XVI Gallica surrendered as well. It took several months before the new emperor Vespasian could send a Roman army to suppress the revolt. This army was commanded by his relative Quintus Petillius Cerialis. During the revolt the IV Macedonica guarded Mainz against attacks by Germanic Chatti, Usipetes and Mattiaci. Although it had for some time been successful and fought bravely during Cerialis' campaign, it was regarded with some suspicion by the new emperor. Because of this it was punished as well: it was reconstituted under a new name, IIII Flavia Felix.

It is a variant on Eugen S√§nger's antimatter rocket.

The redshift rocket proposes to use particle beams, such as those produced by ultrafast laser pulses. Both the matter and antimatter would be accelerated to near light speed away from the spacecraft before colliding in the reaction chamber. This would lead to the radiation that reaches the spacecraft being redshifted. If the speed of the particle beams is great enough, the radiation that hits the spacecraft will be of a frequency that can be reflected. Energy absorbed by the spacecraft could be used to help power the particle beams. But as a result only a very small fraction of the matter and antimatter annihilation reaction would contribute to the propulsion and the main source of thrust would be the particle beams themselves, which must be generated by other means.

Pasos are prized for their smooth, natural, four-beat, lateral ambling gait; they are used in many disciplines, but are especially popular for trail riding. In the United States two main groups of horses are popularly called \\"Paso Fino\\": One, also known as the Pure Puerto Rican Paso Fino (PPR), originated in Puerto Rico.Hendricks, page 331 The other, often called the Colombian Paso Fino or Colombian Criollo Horse (CCC), developed in Colombia. Though from similar Spanish ancestors, the two groups developed independently of one another in their home nations. History The Paso Fino name means 'fine step'. The Paso Fino is a blend of the Barb, Spanish Jennet, and Andalusian horse and was bred by Spanish land owners in Puerto Rico and Colombia to be used in the plantations because of their endurance and comfortable ride. All Pasos share their heritage with the Peruvian Paso, the American Mustangs, and other descendants of Colonial Spanish Horses. Puerto Rican and Colombian horses, as well as Paso Finos from Cuba and other tropical countries, have been interbred frequently in the United States to produce the modern American Paso Fino show horse. On the second voyage of Christopher Columbus from Spain to the Americas in 1493, he disembarked with his soldiers, 20 horses and 5 mares on the island of Borinquen at the bay of Aguada (today A√±asco), and gave the region the name San Juan Bautista.page 1 Cria y mejoramiento de Caballos de Paso Fino de Puerto Rico, Dr Carlos Gaztambide Arillaga 1981 Soon after, in May 1509, the first governor of the island, Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, brought horses to Puerto Rico from his hacienda, El Higuey, located on the neighboring island of La Espa√±ola (now Hispaniola).Juan Villanueva,Paso Fino: A Puerto Rican Breed Magazine, Vol 1, p. 18 =Puerto Rican Paso Fino= Dulce Sue√±o The Puerto Rican Paso Fino was developed on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico over a 500-year colonial period. Island geography and the desires of a people for hardy, sure-footed, comfortable horses led to the independent development of the breed. Frenchman Andres Pedro Ledru, in a notation about horse races held on the 17 of July, 1797, wrote that the speed of these horses was admirable, \\"they have no trot or gallop, but a type of pace (Andadura). A gait so precipitated that the eye can't follow the movement of the legs.\\"Eduardo A Quijano, Raza Que Distingue Un Pueblo, p. 9, CPR SF 293.P37 Q54 1991 c.2 As early as 1849, Paso Fino competitions were held in Puerto Rico, with prizes for winners, for the purpose of improving local horses. In 1882 the first racetrack was built, and in every race meet, there were Paso Fino and Andadura categories.foreword, Gaztambide 1981 According to Ramirez de Arellano, when the United States invaded Puerto Rico, the Paso Fino played a first order role in transportation as well as agricultural work. Manchado, a notable horse of the time owned by Don Nicol√°s Qui√±ones Cabezudo of Caguas, was said to be \\"so fine that it gaited at liberty without its rider in the town square when asked.\\" Gustavo A Ramirez de Arellano, El Caballo de Paso Fino de Puerto Rico, p. 145, Puerto Rico SF 293.P37 R35 1947, referenced on January 1, 2009 In 1927 the most influential sire in the modern Puerto Rican Paso Fino breed, Dulce Sue√±o, was born in Guayama. In 1943, the Federation of the Sport of Paso Fino Horses of Puerto Rico and a breed registry were established. Copita Don Q, a Dulce Sue√±o grandson, was the winner of the first annual Federation contest in 1943.page 225, La Gran Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico, 11 Deportes, 1976. Referenced on December 14th 2008 In an agricultural almanac published in 1947, Gustavo A Ramirez de Arellano wrote, \\"at present the descendants of the famous stallion \\"Dulce Sue√±o\\" are the ones who have most obtained titles and trophies from the association of owners of saddle horses.\\" Arellano, El Caballo, p. 143 =Colombian Paso= =Importation and development in the United States= The rise of the Paso Fino in the United States began in the 1950s and 1960s. The first Paso Finos in the United States were imported by members of the armed services, who purchased the horses while stationed in Puerto Rico. This stock provided some of the first Paso Finos bred in the United States. Colombian Pasos came to the United States beginning with a rancher who visited Colombia and purchased quite a number of the horses to work his cattle. He introduced the second strain into the US. While the two strains are still bred individually to retain their purity, they are also crossbred to produce the best of both strains.\\"The Paso Fino\\". Paso Fino Horse Association. Referenced January 6, 2008. Today, the Paso Fino Horse Association (PFHA) oversees and regulates registered Paso Finos in the US. It was founded in 1972 under the name \\"American Paso Finos\\", later changing to its current name. It registers and promotes both Puerto Rican and Colombian horses, and under the PFHA, the two groups have been frequently crossbred.2007 PFHA Stud Book on CD As the numbers of Colombian horses have begun to significantly outnumber those of Puerto Rican bloodlines, a trend has developed favoring preservation breeding to preserve the bloodlines of each group. The American Trote & Trocha Association formed to promote the horses, primarily of Colombian breeding, that perform a diagonal ambling gait known as the \\"Trocha\\". The Trocha differs from the classic lateral ambling gait of the Paso Fino. Characteristics This mare has tiger eye, an eye color so far only found in Puerto Rican Paso Finos. The Paso Fino tends to be refined, standing an average of but is powerful for its size. It has a convex head, clean legs and a relatively short back with prominent withers. Cannon bones tend to be short and the hooves are hard. The Paso Fino often has a thick mane and tail. It is found in all horse colors and there are no restrictions by the various breed associations. The Puetro Rican Paso Fino is the only breed in which tiger eye was found. Tiger eye which usually lightens the eyes to a striking amber, yellow, or bright orange color. The action of the two strains is somewhat different. The Puerto Rican Paso Fino is prized for its fine or delicate step, while the Colombian Paso Fino tends to have more of a rapid, piston-like action. This is a lively horse that has a natural drive and willingness, known colloquially as \\"brio\\", and generally an amiable disposition. Paso Finos come in a variety of colors, sizes and body types, but the even four-beat gait and brio are present in all good representatives of the breed.\\"Der Paso Fino\\", Paso Fino Association Europe. Referenced January 6, 2008. A Paso Fino gelding of predominantly Colombian breeding =Gaits= The Paso Fino executes a natural evenly spaced four-beat lateral ambling gait, similar to many gaited horses. Both the Colombian and the Puerto Rican strains of the Paso Fino execute the lateral gait naturally, without the aid of training devices. The Paso Fino's gaits are performed at varied levels of extension in stride. All four hooves travel close to the ground while in motion and are lifted equally in height as the horse covers ground. At whatever speed the horse travels, the smoothness of the gait ideally allows the rider to appear motionless with little up and down movement. Paso Fino performing Classic Fino * The classic fino or paso fino is a collected gait with rapid footfalls that covers as little ground as possible. It requires a high degree of collection. This is a show gait reserved for competition. Walking, trotting, cantering or any detected break from the rapid evenly spaced sequence of steps is grounds for disqualification at any time during a fino event. * The paso corto is slightly more extended, and used during trail rides. The speed of this gait is comparable to the speed of a trot but is much smoother. * The paso largo is a fast, lateral, four-beat gait in which the horse can reach speeds equivalent to a canter or slow gallop. The paso largo is not just an increase in speed but also shows a distinct extension in stride. The paso largo can be extremely fast, up to 25-30 mph. Only a few Paso Finos can perform a true classic fino, but the majority perform the other gaits with ease. The correctness of the gait is very important by today's standards, therefore horses with a very even four- beat gait are much preferred for professional breeding. In Colombia, some related native horses perform a slightly different, unevenly timed diagonal four-beat gait, known as the trocha, which is similar to the fox trot, and very smooth. While some Paso Finos will perform the trocha, it is discouraged and considered a fault in the purebred Paso Fino. In Colombia the \\"trocha\\" has evolved, becoming a separate genealogical line. It is inherited in a manner similar to the lateral ambling gaits of the purebred Paso Fino. Trocha rivals in popularity with paso fino in Colombia, but crossbreeding is now avoided. Another Colombian breed performs what is known as trote y galope. The trote y galope horses perform an exaggerated diagonal two-beat trot and a very collected canter, but they do share some common heritage with the Paso Fino. Not as well known as Paso Fino, these variants are just beginning to be recognized in the United States.\\"Breed Information\\" . American Trote and Trocha Association. Referenced January 6, 2008. Uses Paso Finos are versatile and are used in many disciplines. They have horse shows for the breed only, but are also seen competing in all-breed disciplines such as well as trail riding and endurance competition, driving and gymkhana.

On 1 January 2019, it was merged into the new commune √âvry-Courcouronnes. It is located from the center of Paris, in the \\"new town\\" of √âvry Ville Nouvelle, created in the 1960s, of which it is the central and most populated commune. Significant nearby communes include Courcouronnes, Corbeil-Essonnes, Ris-Orangis, Br√©tigny-sur-Orge, and Draveil. Name Originally the commune was called √âvry-sur-Seine (meaning \\"√âvry upon Seine\\"). The name \\"√âvry\\" comes from the Gallic name Eburacon or Eburiacos, meaning \\"land of Eburos\\" (a Gallic patronym), perhaps the leader of a Gallic tribe in the area before the conquest of Gaul by the Romans. After the conquest, the name was corrupted into Latin Apriacum, then Medieval Latin Avriacum, and later Evriacum. In 1881 the name of the commune was changed into √âvry-Petit-Bourg at the request of entrepreneur Paul Decauville, owner of Ateliers de Petit-Bourg, a large boiler works located in √âvry and at the time the largest employer in the area. The factory owed its name to the hamlet of Petit-Bourg (one of the three hamlets on the territory of √âvry) where it was built. On 29 June 1965 the name of the commune was shortened into \\"√âvry\\" only. √âvry had just been chosen to become a \\"new town\\" of the suburbs of Paris, destined to host tens of thousands of suburbanites, and so the name \\"Petit- Bourg\\" (literally meaning \\"little borough, small town\\" in modern French, although etymologists think that this name was in fact the corruption of an old Gallic word with a totally different meaning) was deemed too old fashioned and improper for the new large suburban city of √âvry to be built. History In 1965 √âvry became part of the French new town initiative and took its current name. Before then it was known as \\"√âvry-Petit-Bourg\\" and had a population of only a few thousand. When √âvry was built, Orly was the primary international airport of France, and many international companies such as Digital, Hewlett-Packard, and Alstom established their head offices in √âvry. However, with the expansion of Charles de Gaulle Roissy airport, all the larger companies have moved out, causing the downfall of the many smaller service companies which catered to the lunchtime needs of the thousands of staff who were either displaced or made redundant. Amongst the few international companies remaining are the hotel and catering firm of Accor and the supermarket chain of Carrefour. Although both have a postal Cedex address in √âvry, geographically they are in Courcouronnes. The town has tried to counteract this exodus by increasing the capacity of the commercial center, the Agora, to 235 shops, mostly selling the same wares (54 ready-made women's wear, 14 shoe shops, 28 men's wear, 13 children's wear, 15 jewellers, 9 mobile phone shops, 9 opticians, and 19 restaurants and snack bars). The economy of the Agora has also been hit by the recession. A total of 29 shops and one restaurant are vacant. 24 are on the upper level where the rents are almost double that of the lower level shops. During the week the car parks are now \\"pay by the hour\\" to discourage rail commuters from saturating the parking space during the day to the detriment of shoppers. Weekend parking is free. Another measure taken by the local authorities has been to declare certain quarters a \\"zone franche\\" which means that businesses starting up in these areas are exempt from corporation tax along with many other social benefits and aids which makes √âvry an attractive town for future entrepreneurs. The Cathedral of the Resurrection, dedicated to Saint Corbinien, is one of the few 20th century cathedrals built in a truly modern style (see also Coventry Cathedral Basil Spence 1962, Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Frederick Gibberd 1967). The total cost was 13.72M‚Ç¨. The total surface is 1,600 m2, and it is 34m high. It can receive 1,400 people. Pope John Paul II made a visit on 22 August 1997, and although car parks were requisitioned as far away as Corbeil-Essonnes, apart from invited guests, fewer than 500 people turned out for the event, which means that √âvry may hold the world record for the smallest crowd at a papal appearance. In 2003, the Socialist mayor, Manuel Valls (born 13 August 1962, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, French nationality by naturalisation in 1982), and who is also the constituency deput√© (Member of Parliament) and a qualified avocat (barrister), embarked upon a massive safeguard plan designed to entirely renovate the more defavourised areas which includes much demolition of the obsolete 1960s buildings (especially in the \\"Pyramides\\" quarter, once the French equivalent of the Gorbals), and the upgrading of the more recent residential structures and schools. 2006 saw the final renovation of the Coll√®ge des Pyramides at the cost of 11.43M‚Ç¨ (the price of a new school) and will receive 571 pupils. In 2007, enlargement and renovation was to begin on the Lyc√©e des Loges. The work was to last three years without interruption of lessons, and the budget was set at 40M‚Ç¨. Demolition of several buildings in the Jules Vall√®s quarter of the Pyramides is in progress. They will be replaced by \\"low level\\" blocks of appartements. At the same time, the university residence is being renovated along with the construction of a \\"mall\\" which will eventually link the northern limit of the town with the town centre in preparation for when the tramway will provide a direct transport to Paris as an alternative to the RER railway. On 31 January 2006, in the S√©nat during the 14th ceremony of the \\"Prix du Trombinoscope 2005\\" (press awards), Manuel Valls was elected \\"Local Representative of the Year\\". With the heavy defeat of the Socialists on the national scale during the 2007 elections, Manuel Valls has taken a prominent position in the party and has been given the nickname of \\"Le Sarko de la gauche\\" (the left wing Sarkozy). During the 2008 municipal elections, Manuel Valls was returned to office as mayor on the first round with 70.3% of the vote, which gave him the highest national score for a first-round ballot, making Evry the safest Socialist commune in France. During his first national presentation as a presidential candidate during the Socialist primary elections of 9 October 2011, Manuel Valls won 5.63% of the vote. The 3 June 2012 saw an exceptional reunion of the town council where Manuel Valls resigned as mayor after being nominated as Minister of the Interior in the new Socialist government. Amongst the personalities present were Jacques Guyard, former mayor, Jean-Pierre Caffet, senator, and Lionel Jospin, former prime minister. The first adjoint, Francis Chouat, became the new mayor. The place of first adjoint is now held by Pac√¥me Adjourouvi who was born and grew up in the defavourised Pyramides sector and is now an avocat at the tribunal of Evry. Demographics Rue des Mazi√®res √âvry is demographically the second youngest town in France, with the average age of the population only 26 years. (Recently beaten by Mulhouse with an average age of 24 years.) On 9 September 2011, 7,000 children began a new academic year in the town's 42 schools with eight supplementary classes added. Over 3,300 meals are served daily in the school canteens, and the town has spent ‚Ç¨10 million on education. Not including teaching staff, 350 auxiliaries are employed looking after the 3- to 11-year-old children, along with seven staff specialised in sport. At the other end of the age span, √âvry has only three residences for the elderly, and the cemetery, proportionally small compared to towns with similar a population figure, is closed to further inhumations. Burials are now carried out at the Garenne cemetery in nearby Courcouronnes where a crematorium has also recently been built. Five paediatricians are established in √âvry along with paediatric units in the hospital and in the two private clinics, whereas no funeral parlours or morticians exist in the town of √âvry. =Immigration= Administration Pr√©fecture building of the Essonne department in √âvry √âvry is the pr√©fecture (capital) of the Essonne d√©partement. It is also the official seat of the arrondissement of √âvry, although in reality the sous-pr√©fecture buildings and administration are located in the neighboring commune of Corbeil-Essonnes. √âvry is the seat of the canton Canton of √âvry, which consists of the communes √âvry and Courcouronnes. Transport Evry ‚Äì Courcouronnes Station The regional rapid transit RER line D forks just south of √âvry into two branches, encircling √âvry and the commune of Ris-Orangis before merging into one right- of-way again north of the fork. √âvry is served by three stations along the two branches: √âvry-Val-de-Seine, √âvry ‚Äì Courcouronnes Centre, and Le Bras-de-Fer. The line that serves the station √âvry ‚Äì Courcouronnes Centre and Le Bras-de- Fer was built at the same time as the new town. The town is bordered to the west by the A6 motorway, south by the National 104, and the National 7 running north to south divides the town in two. The Seine marks the eastern limit of the town. A new port has recently been built to accommodate an increase in barge traffic. The local bus network is served by Tice operator, including lines 401, 402, 403 and 453, 404, 405, 407, 408, 414, 414D and 415. By night, Noctilien can be taken from Evry to Villeneuve-Saint-Georges station with line N135 and to Paris-Est station with line N144. Both stations are also deserved by the RER.

The Grand Mosque of √âvry with its 5,525 m2 is one of the largest in Europe, and is of Moroccan architecture. The minaret is 25m tall. It has a large prayer room and can accommodate a total of 5.000 people. √âvry is a \\"multicultural\\" community, yet problems rarely arise. The construction of the mosque was mostly funded by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the interior decoration by the Moroccan king Hassan II. The total cost was ‚Ç¨6.8 million. Although the true story of the kidnapping and death of Ben Barka is still a mystery, many people believe he is buried either under the mosque or in the nearby forest of La Garenne. The Pagoda Khanh-Anh will be the largest Buddhist temple in Europe (3,287 m2) and will accommodate 1,500 people. The initial cost was estimated at ‚Ç¨7.6 million, mostly funded by the Vietnamese community, but is expected to have doubled by the end of the construction. Work began in 1996 and is yet to be completed. The statue of Buddha, 4 metres tall and weighing 5 tons, arrived from Thailand on 20 October 2002. The pagoda will be the headquarters of the European Buddhist Congregation and will be a training school for future monks and nuns. The Dalai Lama consecrated the edifice on 12 August 2008. He made a speech in English which was translated by interpreters into French and Vietnamese. 1,500 adepts were admitted into the grounds coming from as far away as Canada, but only 500 visitors watched the ceremony on a giant screen erected in the nearby park. Political activity The following political parties have a permanent base in √âvry: * Parti Communiste Fran√ßais * Parti Radical de Gauche * Parti Socialiste * UDF * UMP * Groupe des Verts * Groupe \\"D√©fi pour √âvry\\" * Groupe \\"Nous, Citoyens d'√âvry\\" Miscellaneous The composer Gioachino Rossini had a country residence in √âvry to be near his friend Edmond de Goncourt, who lived on the opposite bank of the Seine in Draveil. It was here that he wrote the greater part of his opera The Barber of Seville. On 16 November 1943, Resistance fighter Missak Manouchian was arrested during a gun battle on the banks of the Seine, a few hundred yards from √âvry railway station after his group had been outnumbered. A memorial marks the exact place where he was arrested. Towards the end of the war, General Patton crossed the Seine with his tanks at √âvry en route from Avranches going towards the east. The anniversary of the liberation of √âvry on 23 August 1944, is celebrated annually at the Patton Memorial. Although √âvry is a modern \\"new town\\", which is generally synonymous with \\"concrete jungle\\", 50% of its surface area is parkland and open space. The main thoroughfares are very wide avenues, and trees are to be found everywhere. In the nationwide intercommunal competition \\"Ville Fleurie\\" (flowered town) √âvry has been awarded the high status of \\"3 flowers\\", usually won by country villages.

It is cultivated worldwide as a semiarid crop. Its seeds and leaves are common ingredients in dishes from the Indian subcontinent. Also used in traditional medicine, fenugreek can increase the risk for serious medical side effects, though its culinary use (in smaller quantities) is usually believed to be safe. Fenugreek is not approved or recommended for clinical use by any governmental health agency. History Fenugreek is believed to have been brought into cultivation in the Near East. It is uncertain which wild strain of the genus Trigonella gave rise to domesticated fenugreek. Charred fenugreek seeds have been recovered from Tell Halal, Iraq (carbon dated to 4000 BC), and Bronze Age levels of Lachish and desiccated seeds from the tomb of Tutankhamen. Cato the Elder lists fenugreek with clover and vetch as crops grown to feed cattle. In one first-century A.D. recipe, the Romans flavoured wine with fenugreek. In the 1st century AD, in Galilee, it was grown as a staple food, as Josephus mentions it in his book, the Wars of the Jews.Josephus, De Bello Judaico, book 3, chapter 7, vs. 29. The prepared relish made from ground fenugreek seeds is very slimy and slippery, and was therefore poured over ladders as a stratagem to prevent the enemy's ascent. The plant is mentioned in the 2nd-century compendium of Jewish Oral Law (Mishnah) under its Hebrew name tiltan.Commentators Maimonides and Ovadiah di Bertinoro on Mishnah Kil'ayim 2:5; Terumah 10:5; Orlah 3:6; ibid. 10:6; Ma'aserot 1:3, ibid. 4:6; Ma'aser Sheni 2:2‚Äì3; Niddah 2:6. Etymology The English name derives via Middle French fenugrec from Latin faenugraecum, faenum Graecum meaning \\"Greek hay\\". Production India is a major producer, with fenugreek production in India derived from numerous states. Rajasthan accounts for over 80% of India's output. Uses Fenugreek seeds Fenugreek is used as a herb (dried or fresh leaves), spice (seeds), and vegetable (fresh leaves, sprouts, and microgreens). Sotolon is the chemical responsible for the distinctive maple syrup smell of fenugreek. Cuboid-shaped, yellow- to amber- coloured fenugreek seeds are frequently encountered in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, used both whole and powdered in the preparation of pickles, vegetable dishes, dal, and spice mixes such as panch phoron and sambar powder. They are often roasted to reduce inherent bitterness and to enhance flavour. = Cooking = Fresh fenugreek leaves are an ingredient in some curries, such as with potatoes in cuisines of the Indian subcontinent to make \\"aloo methi\\" (\\"potato fenugreek\\") curry. Sprouted seeds and fenugreek greens are used in salads. When harvested as greens, fenugreek is known as samudra methi in Maharashtra, especially in and around Mumbai, where it is often grown in sandy tracts near the sea, hence the name samudra, \\"ocean\\" in Sanskrit. Samudra methi is also grown in dry river beds in the Gangetic plains. When sold as a vegetable, the young plants are harvested with their roots still attached and sold in small bundles in the markets and bazaars. In Turkish cuisine, fenugreek seeds are used for making a paste known as √ßemen. Cumin, black pepper, and other spices are added into it, especially to make pastƒ±rma. In Iranian cuisine, fenugreek leaves are called shanbalileh. They are one of several greens incorporated into the herb stew ghormeh sabzi, the herb frittata kuku sabzi and a soup known as eshkeneh. In Georgian cuisine, a related species‚ÄîTrigonella caerulea called \\"blue fenugreek\\"‚Äîis used. In Egyptian cuisine, fenugreek is known by the Arabic name hilba or helba ÿ≠ŸÑÿ®ÿ©. Seeds are boiled to make a drink that is consumed at home, as well as in coffee shops. Peasants in Upper Egypt add fenugreek seeds and maize to their pita bread to produce aish merahrah, a staple of their diet. Basterma, a cured dried beef, has its distinctive flavour from the fenugreek used as a coating. Fenugreek is used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine. The word for fenugreek in Amharic is abesh (or abish), and the seed is used in Ethiopia as a natural herbal medicine in the treatment of diabetes. Yemenite Jews following the interpretation of Rabbi Shelomo Yitzchak (Rashi) believe fenugreek, which they call hilbah, hilbeh, hilba, helba, or halba \\"◊ó◊ô◊ú◊ë◊î\\", to be the Talmudic rubia \\"◊®◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ê\\". When the seed kernels are ground and mixed with water they greatly expand; hot spices, turmeric and lemon juice are added to produce a frothy relish eaten with a sop. The relish is also called hilbeh; it is reminiscent of curry. It is eaten daily and ceremonially during the meal of the first and/or second night of the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana.This is based on the assumption that the Aramaic name ◊®◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ê corresponds to it. (Karetot 6a; Horiyot 12a) Rabbenu Nissim at the end of Rosh Hashana, citing the custom of R Hai Gaon. This follows Rashi's translation of ◊®◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ê, cited as authoritative by Tur and Shulchan Aruch OC 583:1. But Abudirham interprets ◊®◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ê as black-eyed peas. =Nutritional profile= In a 100 g amount, fenugreek seeds provide of food energy and contain 9% water, 58% carbohydrates, 23% protein and 6% fat, with calcium at 40% of the Daily Value (DV, table). Fenugreek seeds (per 100 g) are a rich source of protein (46% DV), dietary fiber, B vitamins, and dietary minerals, particularly manganese (59% DV) and iron (262% DV) (table). =Risks and side effects= Although once a folk remedy for an insufficient milk supply when nursing, there is no good evidence that fenugreek is effective or safe for this use. Fenugreek may affect uterine contractions and be unsafe for women with hormone-sensitive cancers. Fenugreek is likely not safe for use during pregnancy as it may have abortifacient effects. Some people are allergic to fenugreek, including those with peanut allergies or chickpea allergies. Fenugreek seeds can cause diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal distention, flatulence, perspiration, and a maple-like smell to sweat, urine or breast milk. There is a risk of hypoglycemia particularly in people with diabetes, and it may interfere with the activity of anti-diabetic drugs. Because of the high content of coumarin-like compounds in fenugreek, it may interfere with the activity and dosing of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs. Fenugreek sprouts, cultivated from a single specific batch of seeds imported from Egypt into Germany in 2009, were implicated as the source of the 2011 outbreak of Escherichia coli O104:H4 in Germany and France. Identification of a common producer and a single batch of fenugreek seeds was evidence for the origin of the outbreaks. =Dietary supplement= Fenugreek dietary supplements are manufactured from powdered seeds into capsules, loose powders, teas, and liquid extracts in many countries. Powders may also be used as a topical medication or dressing for skin wounds or eczema. There is little high-quality evidence that these products have any clinical effectiveness. =Animal feed= Fenugreek is sometimes used as animal feed. It provides a green fodder palatable to ruminants. The seeds are also used to feed fish, domestic rabbits and ruminants. Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Lebas F., 2018. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/242 =Food additive= Fenugreek seeds and leaves contain the molecule sotolone, which imparts the aroma of fenugreek and curry in high concentrations, and maple syrup or caramel in lower concentrations. Fenugreek is used as a flavoring agent in imitation maple syrup or tea, and as a dietary supplement. A mysterious odor of maple syrup - the maple syrup event occurring in New York City in 2005 - was eventually traced to a nearby New Jersey factory of a food additives company processing fenugreek seeds. Research Constituents of fenugreek seeds include flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, vitamins, and saponins; the most prevalent alkaloid is trigonelline and coumarins include cinnamic acid and scopoletin. Research into whether fenugreek reduces biomarkers in people with diabetes and with pre-diabetic conditions is of limited quality. As of 2016, there was no high-quality evidence for whether fenugreek is safe and effective to relieve dysmenorrhea. Because research on potential biological effects of consuming fenugreek has provided no high-quality evidence for health or anti-disease effect, fenugreek is not approved or recommended for clinical use by any governmental health agency.

It is thirty-five kilometres northwest of Ottawa, Ontario. The village, named after the city of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England, is now the southern edge of the municipality of La P√™che, and was founded in 1830 by Irish, Scottish, and English immigrants. Wakefield is approximately a twenty- five-minute drive north of the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge that divides Gatineau and Ottawa (Ontario), along the Autoroute 5, a modern four lane divided highway which has recently been extended to the village. Wakefield is unique as a primarily Anglophone town in a primarily Francophone province. Wakefield in winter History Black Sheep Inn / Le Mouton Noir The village's primary industry is tourism. Attractions in the region include the Gendron covered bridge spanning the Gatineau River; the Wakefield Mill Hotel and Spa; the Wakefield Documentary Film Festival; the Black Sheep Inn (Auberge Mouton Noir), a legendary live music venue; and Eco-Odyssee, a navigable water maze. The village provides access points to Gatineau Park near the junction of Route Principale and the Highway 5, and also at the Wakefield Mill. During the summer months until 2011, a touristic steam train ran daily from Gatineau to Wakefield via Chelsea along the Gatineau River. Covered bridge Recreational activities in and around the village include horseback riding, skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, tubing, snowmobiling, dog sledding, golf, canoeing, and kayaking. There is a popular unsupervised and unofficial swimming area beneath the covered bridge that attracts thousands of people from the surrounding area every summer. The Wakefield community Wakefield community has a thriving arts scene that attracts aficionados seeking an eclectic experience. Grey Owl was partially filmed here in 1999.Grey Owl, IMDb Since 2011 the village has hosted the Wakefield Covered Bridge Run. The Marathon of Health along with the Wakefield community created the running event to raise money for organizations that promote healthy and active lifestyles through sports. The village has developed a reputation for a somewhat bohemian lifestyle and boasts a number of small cafes, pubs, and galleries. Many young families live in the area, enjoying its lifestyle, services, and resources. Many artists live in the surrounding mountains and valleys. Public buildings include the Wakefield Memorial Hospital, an elementary school, the MRC des Collines Police Station, the Daycare Center √âveil de la nature, the Wakefield Retirement Home, and a municipal library. A weekly regional newspaper, The Low Down to Hull and Back News (a play on the Gatineau River communities from Low downstream to Hull), is also published in the village.

They are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico (except the creeping mesquite, which is native to Argentina, but invasive in southern California). The mesquite originates in the Tamaulipan mezquital ecoregion, in the deserts and xeric shrublands biome, located in the southern United States and northeastern Mexico. It has extremely long roots to seek water from very far under ground. The region covers an area of 141,500 km2 (54,600 sq mi), encompassing a portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain in southern Texas, northern Tamaulipas, northeastern Coahuila, and part of Nuevo Le√≥n. As a legume, mesquite is one of the few sources of fixed nitrogen in the desert habitat.

It often produces fruits known as \\"pods\\". Prosopis spp. are able to grow up to 8 m tall, depending on site and climate. It is deciduous and depending on location and rainfall can have either deep or shallow roots. Prosopis is considered long-lived because of the low mortality rate after the dicotyledonous stage and juveniles are also able to survive in conditions with low light and drought. The Cahuilla indigenous people of western North America were known to eat the seeds of mesquite.  History  Prosopis spp. have been in North America since the Pliocene era and their wood has been dated to 3300 yr BP. They are thought to have evolved with megafauna in the New World. The loss of North American megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene era gave way to one theory of how the Prosopis spp. were able to survive. One theory is that the loss of the megafauna allowed Prosopis spp. to use their fruit pods to attract other organisms to spread their seeds; then, with the introduction of livestock, they were able to spread into grasslands. Another is that Prosopis spp. had always been present in grasslands, but recurring fires had delayed plant and seed development before the emergence of livestock and grazing. Etymology The English word mesquite is borrowed from the Spanish word mezquite, which in turn was borrowed from the NƒÅhuatl term mizquitl.Entry for mizquitl in the A Nahuatl‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary and Concordance to the Cantares Mexicanos by John Bierhorst (p. 216).Entry for mesquite in the Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola (Real Academia Espa√±ola).Entry for mesquite in the Online Etymology Dictionary. Habitat Mesquites grow as a small shrub in shallow soil or as tall as in deep soil with adequate moisture, and forms a rounded canopy nearly as wide. They may have one or multiple trunks with a multitude of branches. They have bipinnate leaflets of a light green to blue hue that cast a light to deep shade, depending on the species. Spikes of flowers form in spring and summer that form a flat pod of beans long. Many varieties form thorns. When cut to the ground, the tree can often recover. Uses Nonfederal rangeland where native invasive mesquite species are present in the United States Once the pod is dry, the whole pod is edible and can be ground into flour and made into bread. Mesquite is native to the US and can be used as a type of lumber. It was a popular type of wood used by early Spaniards to build ships, but is now used most commonly for high-end rustic furniture and cabinets. Scraps and small pieces are used commonly as wood for cooking with smoke in Southern states. Red-orange sap can be found on the branches of mesquite trees during the summer. This sap was used by those who lived in the desert for several medicinal treatments. The sap was used as a salve and spread on burns and cuts to speed up the healing process. Gargling a mixture of water and sap was used to soothe sore throats, and the same mixture was said to be able to cure upset stomachs. As an introduced and invasive species Honey mesquite has been introduced to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia and is considered by the World Conservation Union as one of the world's most problematic invasive species. Its spread into grasslands is mostly attributed to the introduction of domestic livestock, although other factors include climate change, overgrazing, and the reduction of fire frequency. Although Prosopis spp. are naturally occurring in these areas, these changes have resulted in their being able to successfully outcompete other native plants and they are now considered invasive species because they are able to take advantage of vulnerable ecosystems. Prosopis spp. are different from most invasive species because they are highly invasive in their native and introduced ranges. Their impacts on the invaded ecosystems include changes to hydrological, energy, and nutrient cycling, as well as consequences to biodiversity and primary production. Prosopis spp. density and canopy cover influence the herbaceous layer and native shrubs and are factors in the changes to the ecosystem. In the United States, Prosopis has become the dominant woody plant on of semiarid grasslands. North America is its native range and due to an imbalance within this ecosystem has been able to spread rapidly. It is considered the most common and widely spread \\"pest\\" plant in Texas. An estimated 25% of Texas‚Äô grasslands are infested and 16 million acres are so invaded that it is suppressing the majority of grass production. In Mexico and the US, the two most problematic species are honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina). Australia is also affected by the introduction of Prosopis spp., in particular, the P. pallida, P. glandulosa, P. velutina, and their hybrid P. juliflora. Prosopis spp. are ranked nationally as one of the 20 most significant weeds. They now cover almost 1 million hectares of land. Prosopis spp. were originally introduced to help with erosion because of their deep root systems. They also have immediate uses to humans through timber and providing a food source through their pods. Since Australia is a hot and semiarid region, Prosopis spp. have been able to become naturalized. In India, mesquite had been introduced decades ago, but until recently, its effects had not been studied. This genus has been pushing out the Indian wild ass (Equus hemionus khur). This herbivorous mammal eats the pods of Prosopis spp, which was one of the intended purposes of its introduction. Through digesting and excreting the seeds, the Indian wild asses are providing the habitat needed for germination. The 5,000-km2 Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary is experiencing mesquite invasion of roughly 1.95 km2 a year. By overtaking the land, the dense canopy cover of mesquite has made it so native vegetation cannot grow. It has also made watering holes inaccessible to the animals within this region. This lack of resources and range is forcing the endangered Indian wild ass into human landscapes and agriculture fields and locals are killing these asses to protect their crops.  Control strategies  Controlling mesquite is a challenging task. One often-used method is mechanical control. This can be effective with high mortality rates if stems are cut at least 20 cm underground. Another method is through the application of herbicides, done on an individual plant basis.https://texnat.tamu.edu/about/brush-busters/mesquite/ Basal application is effective to mesquite of all sizes, while foliar application is best for plants smaller than 1.5 m. Another physical option for control is through fires. Some species of mesquite are fire-sensitive, while others are fire- tolerant. For those that are fire-sensitive, this method can be highly effective, but those that are fire-tolerant require hot and intense fires to be effective. In Australia, scientists are trying biological control methods. They have introduced multiple insects, but the most effective in causing high population level impact is the leaf-tying moth (Evippe spp.). The most recommended method for managing Prosopis, both in native and introduced ranges, is by targeting large numbers of plants either through herbicide or physical removal. Also, research is being done on using satellite and aerial images to assess canopy cover and determine which ranges should be targeted.

In modern elections  In 2012, Huffington Post columnist Sanford Jay Rosen stated that the idea became a common practice for left-leaning voters in the United States due to their overwhelming disapproval of the United States government's support for the Vietnam War. Rosen stated: \\"Beginning with the 1968 presidential election, I often have heard from liberals that they could not vote for the lesser of two evils. Some said they would not vote; some said they would vote for a third party candidate. That mantra delivered us to Richard Nixon in 1972 until Watergate did him in. And it delivered us to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in 2000 until they were termed out in 2009\\". Opponents of the modern usage of these terms in reference to electoral politics include revolutionaries who oppose the existing system as a whole as well as political moderates who advocate that third parties be given greater exposure in that system. For a particular voter in an election with more than two candidates, if the voter believes the most preferred candidate cannot win, the voter may be tempted to vote for the most favored viable candidate as a necessary evil or the lesser of two evils. Supporters of lesser-evil tactics in the United States often cite United States politician Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns as examples of what can happen when a third-party candidate receives a significant number of votes. They claim that the mere existence of the third-party candidate essentially steals votes (\\"tilts\\" or \\"tips the scales\\") from the more progressive of the two main candidates and puts the election in favor of the \\"worse\\" candidate‚Äîbecause the small percentage that goes towards the third party candidate is a part \\"wasted\\" that could have instead gone to the lesser-evil candidate. For example, as the Green Party candidate in 2000, Nader garnered 2.7% of the popular vote and as a result is considered by some Democrats to have tipped the election to Bush. One counterargument is that Nader's candidacy likely increased turnout among liberals and that Al Gore took four of the five states‚Äîand thirty of the fifty-five electoral college votes‚Äîin which the outcome was decided by less than one percent of the vote. Others argue that supporters of Nader and other third party candidates draw from voters who would not vote for either Democrats or Republicans. In the 2016 United States presidential election, both major candidates of the major parties‚ÄîHillary Clinton (D) and Donald Trump (R)‚Äîhad a disapproval rating close to 60% by August 31, 2016. Green Party candidate Jill Stein invoked this idea in her campaign in her slogan \\"Don't vote for the lesser evil, fight for the greater good\\". In his DarkHorse podcast, Bret Weinstein describes his Unity 2020 proposal for the 2020 presidential election as an option that, in case of failure, would not asymmetrically weaken voters' second best choice on a single political side, thereby avoiding the lesser evil paradox. In elections between only two candidates where one is mildly unpopular and the other immensely unpopular, opponents of both candidates frequently advocate a vote for the mildly unpopular candidate. For example, in the second round of the 2002 French presidential election graffiti in Paris told people to \\"vote for the crook, not the fascist\\". The \\"crook\\" in those scribbled public messages was Jacques Chirac of Rally for the Republic and the \\"fascist\\" was Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front. Chirac eventually won the second round having garnered 82% of the vote.  Mythology  \\"Between Scylla and Charybdis\\" is an idiom derived from Homer's Odyssey. In the story, Odysseus chose to go near Scylla as the lesser of two evils. He lost six of his companions, but if he had gone near Charybdis all would be doomed. Because of such stories, having to navigate between the two hazards eventually entered idiomatic use. Another equivalent English seafaring phrase is \\"Between a rock and a hard place\\".Definition from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English available online The Latin line incidit in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim (\\"he runs into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis\\") had earlier become proverbial, with a meaning much the same as jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Erasmus recorded it as an ancient proverb in his Adagia, although the earliest known instance is in the Alexandreis, a 12th-century Latin epic poem by Walter of Ch√¢tillon.Noted by Edward Charles Harington in Notes and Queries 5th Series, 8 (7 July 1877:14).  In popular culture  The principle of \\"the lesser of two evils\\" is sometimes jokingly changed to \\"the evil of two lessers\\", such as in the titles of these articles about the US presidential elections of 1988 and 2016. One early variant of this, humorously contrasting the late songwriter Frank Loesser and his brother, was \\"the evil of two Loessers\\". Note: Michael McDowell was comparing Gay Mitchell to his brother Jim. In Patrick O'Brian's 1979 novel Fortune of War, and in the 2003 movie Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, Captain Jack Aubrey jokes that \\"in the Navy you must always choose the lesser of two weevils\\". \\"The lesser of two weevils\\" is also the title of a 2005 children's book by Steve Wide. illustrated by Michelle Mackintosh  See also  * Consequentialism * Dilemma * False dilemma * Necessary evil * Principle of double effect * Two wrongs make a right * Trolley problem * Ticking time bomb scenario  References   External links  Political campaign techniques International relations Dilemmas Ethical principles Good and evil ","title":"Lesser of two evils principle"},{"id":"289844","text":"Alferd Griner Packer (January 21, 1842 ‚Äì April 23, 1907), also known as \\"The Colorado Cannibal\\", was an American prospector and self-proclaimed professional wilderness guide who confessed to cannibalism during the winter of 1874. He and five other men had attempted to travel through the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, during the peak of a harsh winter. When only Packer reached civilization, he said that he had been abandoned by his party, but eventually confessed that the party had resorted to forced cannibalism of dead members to stay alive when they became lost. He later recanted this story, and confessed to having singularly lived off the flesh of his companions, during his snowbound state ‚Äì after they had fallen victim to party member Shannon Bell, whom Packer said he shot in self-defense. He confessed to having used their flesh to survive, while stranded and during his trek out of the mountains, nearly two and a half months later. After Packer's story was called into question, he escaped jail and hid from justice for nine years before being tried, convicted of premeditated murder, and sentenced to death. Packer won a retrial, and was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison, on five counts of voluntary manslaughter. An almost completely fictitious biopic of his exploits, The Legend of Alfred Packer, was released in 1980. A more comedic and heavily fabricated take on the story, titled Cannibal! The Musical, was released in 1993. Early life Alferd Griner Packer was born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on January 21, 1842, and was one of three children born to James Packer and his wife, Esther Griner. By the early 1850s, James Packer had moved his family to LaGrange County, Indiana, where he worked as a cabinetmaker.US Census, 1860, Lagrange Co., Indiana, page 9, residence #68 Alferd is said to have had a bitter relationship with his parents, and later moved in his late teens to the Minnesota area, where he worked as a shoemaker. Career Packer served in the Union Army, during the American Civil War. He enlisted on April 22, 1862 in Winona, Minnesota and was assigned to the 16th U.S. Infantry Regiment ‚Äì Company F. He was honorably discharged due to epilepsy eight months later, at Fort Ontario, New York.Army Register of Enlistments 1862, #182, regular army He moved south and on June 25, 1863, enlisted in the 8th Iowa Cavalry Regiment ‚Äì Company C, at Ottumwa, Iowa. However, he was discharged at Cleveland, Tennessee, on April 22, 1864, for the same reason.Compiled Service Record of Alfred G. Parker, 8th Iowa Cavalry Regiment Packer suffered from seizures, secondary to his condition, and is reported as having had them about every two days ‚Äì which ultimately led to his discharge. He then traveled west, and over the next nine years, worked at numerous odd jobs. These professions ranged from: hunter, wagon teamster, ranch hand, and field worker, but his seizures and overall attitude ensured that he never kept a job for long. He also worked for a couple of months as a guide, but those who knew him at this time later stated that being a guide was by no means his strong point and he was prone to lose his way. He ended up working mining-related jobs, drifting from mine to mine, but never found prosperity through the industry. He worked for a short time in the Colorado area as a miner, but moved on to Utah upon having no luck there. By all accounts, Packer was generally disliked and distrusted by most who knew him. He was recalled by several different people as having been known to steal, and being a quarrelsome and difficult person to get along with. Just as modern researchers conclude, most of Packer's contemporaries also had the impression that he was a nearly pathological liar. Expedition In November 1873, 20 men left the Bingham Canyon mines near Salt Lake City, Utah, for the gold fields of Breckenridge, Colorado ‚Äì upon news of a massive strike that was discovered there. The men were largely strangers to each other, and banded together to make their fortune in Colorado, after Bob McGrue rallied any willing men to follow him. A member of this original party, George Tracy, claimed that the men encountered Packer some 25 miles from their starting point, near Provo. Packer asked where they were headed, and when he heard they were headed to the gold country of the San Juan Mountains, he said he would like to join them. Packer was without money and also lacked adequate supplies, so the men were apprehensive to take him along, but Packer claimed he was both a prospector and a guide, and that he knew the San Juan territory well. His claim gave him a position of worth among the simple prospectors, who knew little or nothing of Colorado's geography. Unfortunately, neither did Packer. Members of this original party later said that he had vastly overstated his experience of being a seasoned guide familiar to the area, or had even possibly fabricated his qualifications altogether. He was also reported as being without a rifle at the time the expedition left, having only a Colt revolver with him. Throughout the course of their journey Packer was reported as being greedy with rations, a bit of a beggar, lazy, and obstinate. He was reported to have quarreled constantly with party member Frank Miller. At the time of his first trial, Packer was characterized as a \\"whining fraud\\" by party member Preston Nutter. His seizures also made his presence in the group strenuous. The party made less than adequate progress towards their destination. The winter was becoming a major obstacle for them, as the wagons and horses of the assemblage were being bogged down, along with the fact that the Mormon Trail they were following was becoming heavily snowed over and largely indistinguishable, forcing the men to rely almost solely on a compass. Packer's inexperience was also beginning to show itself, and the party ultimately became lost. Provisions quickly ran out, and the men were reduced to surviving for a considerable length of time on horse feed, and were nearing the point where the horses themselves were next to be eaten. On January 21, 1874, the party came upon the encampment of Chief Ouray, known as the White Man's Friend, near Montrose, Colorado, within the Uncompahgre Valley. The men were desperate but still approached the camp with great trepidation, unsure of how they would be received by the tribe. Although they reportedly scared some of the Utes away with their haggard appearance, Chief Ouray greeted them as welcomed guests and supplied them with food and lodging, to their grateful astonishment. He recommended they postpone their expedition until spring, since they were likely to encounter dangerous winter weather in the mountains. He told them that no Ute would attempt such a journey, and that to chance it would be to risk almost certain death. Ouray offered to allow the men to stay with his tribe until the winter had passed, and promised to share all that he and his people had with them. Breckenridge was being descended upon by miners from all over the country, and a fear of missing out on the riches made some of the men anxious to continue on. After a couple of weeks with Ouray and his people, the party convened and discussed leaving. However, it was the beginning of February at this point and the snow had been relentless since their arrival: meaning that half of the party was forced to stay put with their wagons and horses until spring. Eleven men in total were unencumbered to proceed on, and they decided to do so. Intending to travel first to the Los Pin√≥s Indian Agency, which was the closest outpost to the camp, and proceed onward to Breckenridge from there. Chief Ouray saw that there was no changing the men's minds, and gave them food for their journey as well as safe directions, that bypassed the mountains. Packer, however, was in favor of getting to the agency by going through the mountains: stating it was a more direct route. Five of the eleven men were adamantly in favor of following Ouray's directions, which would largely have them following the Gunnison River, along its banks. Packer insisted that he knew the country well, and that his way was quicker, eventually securing five men to follow him. Oliver D. Loutsenhizer and the four other men left first, following the Gunnison River. This party's own journey was besieged by bad weather and freezing temperatures, and although they followed the river, provisions ran out well before they reached their destination. The men were close to starvation, when cowhands with the Government Cattle Camp near Gunnison, Colorado, came upon them by chance and gave them food and shelter. They remained at the camp until later that April. On February 9, Packer and the five others in his party left for the Los Pin√≥s Indian Agency, intending to traverse the mountains. Besides Packer the group comprised: Shannon Wilson Bell, James Humphrey, Frank \\"Butcher\\" Miller, George \\"California\\" Noon, and Israel Swan. The fact that no one in the other group opposed their \\"guide\\" leaving, has led many researchers to conclude that Packer's inexperience and overall attitude had become quite taxing to them, and that they figured they were better off without him. The men in Packer's party had a 75-mile journey ahead of them. The leader of the combined parties, Bob McGrue, guided Packer's party along the river route advised by Chief Ouray until his horses could not continue. McGrue unloaded the men's provisions and went back to Ouray's camp. The men continued along the river for a time, before Packer took his party along a path higher up in the San Juan Mountains, disregarding Ouray's ominous warning. This decision was made when the men barely had enough food to cover the supposed 14 days it would take to travel the safest route, possessed no snowshoes, had a bare minimum of matches and no flint, and also had no heavy clothing that would combat the extreme cold. They went into the mountains with; two rifles, one pistol, a couple of knives, a hatchet, and minimal ammunition. What happened after this is not clear. Two months later On the 16th of April 1874, Packer emerged from the woods alone and stumbled his way across a frozen lake bed to the Los Pin√≥s Indian Agency, near Saguache, Colorado, with rags lashed to his feet. As the men of the agency sat around the table of the mess hall eating breakfast, the door flung open, and Packer stood before them begging for food and shelter. He carried with him a rifle, a knife, a steel coffee pot, and a satchel. The men hurried Packer inside, sat him down at the table and gave him some food, which he vomited as quickly as he ate it. Packer said that his digestion was altered, as a result of his prolonged near-starvation. After several shots of whiskey, he regaled to the men the events leading up to Ouray's camp, and that he had been hired by five men to guide them to Breckenridge from there. He stated that during their journey, he had become snow-blind and was lagging behind the remainder of his party, becoming a burden for them. Packer claimed that a member of the party, named Israel Swan, supplied him with a rifle. They then abandoned him. He claimed he was then forced to survive on his own and make his way out of the mountains with minimal ammunition and virtually no supplies, and ate little else than roots and rose buds the entire time he was alone. The men at the agency listened to his story, but found it rather odd, that even though he had been lost in the wilderness for a little over two months ‚Äì he did not look as malnourished and threadbare as most lost wanderers they had ever come across. His face was reported as being bloated, and his overall physique hardly skeletal. Packer claimed he was broke, and sold the Winchester rifle he had in his possession to Major Downer, the agency's justice of the peace, for $10 (). Packer stayed at the agency for ten days before he expressed that he wished to go back home to Pennsylvania, and then headed to the nearby town of Saguache, to buy supplies for his journey. When he reached Saguache, Packer made arrangements to room in Dolan's Saloon. Larry Dolan, the owner, claimed that Packer spent around $100 () during his stay, and that Packer even offered to lend him $300. Packer also spent $78 in Otto Mears' general store. It was also claimed that he had several different wallets in his possession. Packer drank heavily and daily, and after becoming intoxicated he gave several different and conflicting stories regarding his journey and how he came to be detached from the other men. This led to quick gossip among the townspeople, given his ever- evolving story, seemingly endless cash flow, and the fact that his party was still unheard from. Preston Nutter, a member of the original party who remained at Ouray's camp, arrived in Saguache around this time with two other original party members. He encountered Packer in Dolan's Saloon, drinking and carrying on. Nutter asked Packer where the rest of his party was, with Packer claiming that he had: \\"got his feet wet and frozen\\". He stated, that they had set up camp when a winter storm set in, and he started a fire to warm up while the others went ahead to look for food. Packer claimed that Swan left him with his rifle in case of trouble and that they never returned. He presumed they had abandoned him. He claimed he was forced to leave the party to their unknown fate, as he had no idea where they went when they left him, and lived mainly on rose buds and the occasional squirrel as he made his trek out. Nutter thought his story odd, considering that Packer looked rather well-fed and that it would be a potentially fatal choice for five miners unfamiliar with Colorado to abandon their \\"guide\\" in the snowbound mountains of a territory he claimed to know well. He also found it hard to believe that the men would simply abandon him. Nutter also thought it peculiar that Israel Swan would simply give Packer his rifle and wish him well before pressing on with the four other men with only one rifle as a means of shooting game. Furthermore, where was Packer's Colt revolver that he had been carrying when he left both Provo and Ouray's camp? Where did his drinking money come from when Packer was flat broke when he joined the party? Nutter also noted that Packer had in his possession a skinning knife that had belonged to Frank \\"Butcher\\" Miller. Nutter asked Packer how he came to have it, with Packer stating that Miller had stuck it in a tree and walked off without it. Having had doubts about Packer's story from the beginning, Nutter was all but convinced that something nefarious had happened. In addition to his suspicions, Nutter had come to view Packer in the same negative light as Loutsenhizer, based on his performance and overall character leading up to their arrival at Ouray's camp. Accusations were flung and words were exchanged, with Nutter threatening to hang Packer. Nutter later stated, regarding Packer: ‚ÄúHe was sulky, obstinate and quarrelsome. He was a petty thief willing to take things that did not belong to him, whether of any value or not.\\" The two men were separated, and Packer made plans to move on. Meanwhile, back at the Los Pin√≥s Indian Agency, two men of the five-man party that had taken the Gunnison River route before being rescued by government cowhands finally arrived at their destination. They were joined a few days later by the remaining three men, including Oliver D. Loutsenhizer. The men were introduced to the head of the agency, General Charles Adams, who greeted them and relayed to them that he had already received another member of their party by the name of Alferd Packer ‚Äì and that he spoke of desertion at the hands of his companions. All five men at once discredited what Packer had told the General and his staff, stating that the men that they had known would never abandon a man to die. Loutsenhizer flatly told the General that Packer was not to be trusted, and that he was sure that something bad had happened in the mountains. He noted the Winchester rifle carried in by Packer, belonged to an elderly man in Packer's party and that a pipe he had left behind at the agency belonged to a man named Shannon Bell, who was also a member of his party. The men convinced General Adams to dispatch a mounted agency officer to Saguache at once to retrieve Packer for questioning, but under the guise of him being sequestered for a search party for the missing men. Packer was in the process of getting his things gathered to leave the area, when he was again approached by Nutter and some other men. The agency officer arrived just in time and got between the men. He told Packer he had been sent to enlist him as a guide for the search party for the missing men. Packer was reluctant to go, but with little other option than vigilante justice, he agreed. He mounted his recently purchased horse, and followed the officer back to Los Pin√≥s, but not before Nutter had a private chat with the officer. =Confessions= Upon arriving at the agency, Packer came face-to-face with General Adams, and five men he had not seen since February. The agency officer came in after Packer and relayed to General Adams: a man named Preston Nutter had told him that Packer had spent several hundred dollars over his six-week stay in Saguache as well as buying a new horse and saddle, that he was in possession of things that belonged to missing men, and that he was penniless when he had originally joined their party. Loutsenhizer demanded an explanation from Packer, who repeated the story exactly as he had told it the first time. Packer showed amazement that the men had not been heard from, and was concerned for their well-being. Loutsenhizer scoffed at his story, demanding to know where his newly acquired wealth came from, with Packer stating that he had received a cash loan from a man in Saguache. Adams told Packer that if this were true, then he should not mind staying at the agency, while the officer was sent back to Saguache to verify his story. Packer agreed with slight hesitation. The officer was dispatched at once, and after a short while, returned with news from various sources that Packer had been seen with several different wallets and had told varying stories regarding his journey. He had arrived in Saguache with plenty of cash, and no one in town claimed to have loaned him a penny. Adams convened a council of the five miners, himself, Packer, and the agency officers to settle the matter. As they began the proceedings, two Ute tribesmen rushed into the agency holding strips of dried human flesh they referred to as \\"white man's meat\\", which they had found on a hill near the agency while hunting. Packer reportedly fainted and crumpled to the floor. He was revived and profusely began begging for mercy, swearing to make a full confession. After a long silence, he cryptically stated to Adams: ‚ÄúIt would not be the first time that people had been obliged to eat each other when they were hungry.\\" Packer slowly and sobbingly began to tell, what was to become one of several different official statements, over the next three decades. Herman Lauter, the agency clerk, was in attendance and transcribed Packer's first official statement. Packer claimed that the men had left Ouray's camp, with what they thought was sufficient food for the anticipated 14-day journey ahead of them. Before they knew it, provisions were exhausted due to the rough terrain, and expenditure of energy needed for the traverse. They survived for days on roots dug from the ground, pine gum, rose buds, and the occasional rabbit. After a few days of no wildlife activity due to the extreme cold and eating virtually nothing but roots, he claimed that the men started to eye each other in an unsettling way, their stomachs twisting in hunger. A few days after this, he left camp to gather dry firewood and returned to find four men around the slain body of Israel Swan, who had been struck in the head with a hatchet and killed instantly. The four started to butcher Swan, with Packer accepting the situation, and joining them. He claimed several thousand dollars was found on Swan's person, and it was divided between the men. They consumed the most agreeable parts of Swan's body, packed some up, and moved on, with Packer appropriating Swan's rifle. Within two days, however, the five men were again out of meat, and game continued to elude them. Packer, Bell, Humphrey, and Noon decided in secret that Miller would be the next to go. Packer confessed that Miller was a stocky man, and was chosen for his amount of soft flesh. He was killed with a hatchet blow to the head, while he was stooping to pick up wood for the fire, then butchered and consumed. Packer took Miller's knife, having admired it, and Miller's share of Swan's money was redistributed among the four men, who then moved on to Los Pin√≥s. The winter was relentless and the men were slow-moving, barely able to see in front of them, cursing the wind that was cutting at their exposed skin. Humphrey was next to be sacrificed, followed before too long by George Noon. At last it was just down to Bell and Packer. He claimed that the two men swore on Almighty God to not eat each other. They each had a rifle a piece at this point and a couple thousand dollars of Swan's cash, and presumed that two men would fare well on the remainder of their trip, with what minimal game there was to be found. They agreed they would say the four men had perished due to the elements, and were buried with dignity, vowing to never speak of the cannibalism. They felt no one would ever believe it was \\"necessary\\", as they had. After trekking for a few days, with little else eaten other than a rabbit and some roots, the men were exhausted and set up camp next to a large lake that was skirted on one side by a large grove of hemlock trees. Packer said that a few days after this, Bell snapped up out of his blanket and screamed that he could not take it anymore. He told Packer that one of them was going to die for food. He snatched his rifle and sprinted at Packer with it readied to bash his skull in. Packer deflected the blow and cleaved Bell in the head with the hatchet. He claimed that at this point the only fear he had left was to starve to death. He then butchered Bell, eating as much as he could in preparation for the remaining leg of his journey, and packed a good amount away. He relieved Bell of his share of Swan's money and then headed on, unsure how far he was from anywhere or if he was even going to survive. After a while he mounted a hill and saw at long last the Los Pin√≥s Indian Agency. He threw the remaining strips of Bell's flesh away, presuming that an animal would hastily eat them, and admitted that he did so with a fair degree of hesitation. He confessed that he had grown quite fond of human flesh, and found the portion around the breasts to be especially delicious. Loutsenhizer erupted with anger, but General Adams exerted his authority, and called for a consultation between the five men and the agency officers to determine the next course of action. It was decided that a search party would be assembled at once to find the men's remains. The five Utah men claimed that they did not believe one part of Packer's story, and that Bell was the sort of man that would lay down his life for another, if needed. General Adams asked of the two Ute men if they knew of an area next to a lake that Packer had described. They said that such a place existed roughly 50 miles away, across the hills. The search party was headed by agency clerk Herman Lauter and consisted of the five miners from Utah, a few agency officers, and Packer acting as guide. After two weeks, as the party was reaching the area of the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River, Packer claimed he was lost and that the area did not look right. Loutsenhizer called Packer a liar and a murderer, and insisted that he be hung then and there. Nothing was found, and the party headed back to the agency. Along their route back, Packer attempted to murder Herman Lauter with a large knife he had concealed in his clothing. He was caught in the act, restrained, and arrested. General Adams had been willing to believe Packer up to this point, but the unprovoked attempt made on his officer's life convinced him that Packer was dangerous. He was transported to Saguache and jailed by the sheriff outside the town itself for his own protection. During Packer's detention, he retracted what he had told the men at the agency about the events leading up to the five men losing their lives. He now claimed that the men had encountered a strong blizzard along their way through the mountains. The snow fell so heavily and persistently, that they became hopelessly lost, and were unable to retrace their steps back to their starting point. Provisions were already minimal when they began the trek, and quickly ran out. They just as quickly ran out of matches, and were forced to carry hot embers in a steel coffee pot to have a means to light fires. Days went by with no signs of game, and attempts at ice fishing proved utterly futile. After roasting and eating their shoes and attempting to survive on what scant and edible vegetation they could find, it was Packer's claim that the men entered into a pact wherein if one died, their meat would serve to save the others from starvation. After days of hiking with virtually nothing to eat, Israel Swan could go no further, and the others were dangerously fatigued. They found a pine-shaded gulch next to a lake, and set up camp. A short time after this, Packer claimed that Swan died of a combination of hunger and exposure. Packer signed his first confession: In Packer's later amended version of this story, the men had endured almost 20 days from Ouray's camp and more than 10 without any substantial food at all. Packer elaborated that James Humphrey had also died of exposure to the extreme cold, and that George Noon was killed days later by Shannon Bell for the sole purpose of food, after there was no more substantial meat to be had from the three fallen men. Then it was just down to Bell and himself. He claimed that he and Bell had agreed that they would stand together until the end, swearing not to eat each other. Days went by, and Bell could no longer take the hunger and rushed at Packer with his rifle, intending to bludgeon him with its stock. Packer then shot Bell with his pistol. Packer confessed to taking the valuables of the deceased members, claiming they no longer needed them, but made no statements as to the exact items taken nor to the amount of money accrued. =Discovery of bodies= Harpers illustration (cropped). Top row left to right: George \\"California\\" Noon; James Humphreys; Middle row: Shannon Wilson Bell; Lower left: Israel Swan; Lower right: Frank Miller. Memorial to Packer's victims, at the scene of the crime, southeast of Lake City, Colorado The following August, the site of the incident was happened upon by John A. Randolph, an illustrator who worked for Harper's Weekly magazine. He discovered all five of the bodies at the foot of Slumgullion Pass, two miles southeast of Lake City, Colorado, in a pine-shaded gulch skirted by hemlock trees. They lay above the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River, now known colloquially as Dead Man's Gulch, which matched the description of where Packer had originally claimed that only Bell had met his end. The men had been well within hiking distance of the nearby city, had they descended the Lake Fork instead of traversing up it, especially in their alleged desperate situation, but Packer was the guide. The snow that had been covering the bodies and campsite had melted in the elapsed four months. Randolph sketched the scene as he found it, and then alerted authorities in nearby Lake City. The story was covered two months later in the October 17, 1874, edition of Harper's Weekly, and included his illustration of the site. The local coroner and law enforcement set out for the site, along with about 20 volunteers and discovered the bodies of all five men in various states of decomposition, having been left to the elements and animals for four months. First responders to the site noted that it appeared that \\"extreme violence\\" had befallen the men, and it was putrid with the smell of death. Frank Miller's head was missing entirely from the campsite; his and Israel Swan's corpses had been considerably worked upon by scavengers and were little more than scattered bones. Israel's skull had a jagged chunk missing out of it, and it was presumed that Miller's head was carried away by an animal. The bodies of George Noon and James Humphrey were largely flayed torsos of rotting viscera, attached to skeletal legs, but with intact and bearded faces, with Humphrey's face being slightly more decayed than Noon's. They had received blows to the head, the shape indicating perhaps a hatchet, and their bodies had noticeable broken bones. Shannon Bell lay with largely skeletal legs splayed and arms to his sides that were crudely cut to their bones leading to hands that were still fully skinned. His remaining corpse was a putrid mass of viscera encased in an almost wholly flayed torso, which led to an almost still-living face, complete with a thick red beard and bushy hair. The lack of noticeable decay in his face suggested that he had been the last to die. The top of Bell's skull had been ripped open and his brains were lying on the ground beneath him. The three men whose bodies were still intact or partly intact, had flesh and muscle excised from choice and meaty locations: no attempt had been made to consume bone marrow or any organs at all. The state of the bodies immediately contradicted Packer's version of events. They were all together in one spot, not scattered across miles. Both Humphrey and Noon had large portions of remaining flesh, muscle, organs, etc., that could have been consumed long before Bell succumbed to the madness of hunger and attempted to murder Packer, as he had claimed. The men had tattered cloths lashed to their rotting feet, which had replaced the shoes they had eaten in their desperation, and moldy and tattered blankets lay beneath and beside them. A beaten path went from the resting place of the corpses to a crude shelter that was used by Packer, and there was evidence to suggest that the deaths might possibly have occurred before supplies were totally exhausted. Within the shelter were possessions belonging to the men that Packer had left behind. The theory at the time was; Packer killed the men before supplies ran out to rob them of their possessions, got snowed in, and then lived in his makeshift shelter for months, walking to his slain companions and slicing meat off as needed. Preston Nutter accompanied the party to the site, and identified the bodies as belonging to the five missing men. A rifle broken in two was found close to the bodies. Due to the damage apparent on their remains, it is presumed that it was used to bludgeon one or more of them. Their remains were buried at the site by officials, and the search party returned to Packer's makeshift jail to confront him, only to find him missing. The \\"jail\\" in question was little more than a log cabin located on ranch property belonging to the Saguache County Sheriff. Months had passed with no definitive evidence of a crime having been committed, no bodies discovered, and no formal charges lodged against Packer ‚Äì other than the attempt on Lauter's life, which was not tenaciously sought for prosecution and used more so as a means to keep him under custody. Saguache County authorities were reportedly not happy about taxpayer dollars being spent so exorbitantly on keeping Packer housed and under constant guard. He was allegedly passed a makeshift key for his irons and given some supplies, and easily escaped. Even so, nearly the entirety of Saguache was convinced, either through rumor or rational deduction, that Packer was guilty of either robbery or murder. His life was threatened constantly by the nearby townspeople. Packer never divulged who helped him escape, how this was achieved, or why. It was presumed that his guard had been bribed by Packer himself, or by someone else. The generally accepted theory at the time was that Packer had attached himself to the party under highly overstated qualifications of being a mountain guide familiar with the area in order to accompany the men to Breckenridge, and had at best, led his party to miserable deaths due to gross incompetence. This was enough of a crime in itself as far as the local population was concerned. However, an ultimately more popular theory was that he had set out with his party of five men from Ouray's camp, with a premeditated plan to lead them into the wilderness where he would kill and rob them. Nutter and Loutsenhizer made it a personal mission to discredit Packer's alleged qualifications as far as being a guide, let alone a mountain guide, pointed out all of his character flaws that they had come to know, and stressed his numerous different stories and inconsistencies. Local papers picked up on the story and the incident received constant coverage, with highly sensational headlines, many negative comments regarding Packer's character, and highly imagined theories that grabbed both national and international attention. Regardless as to how it may have happened, nearly the entire population of Saguache, and soon nearly the entire country and beyond, found that Packer's culpability for his party's deaths was beyond doubt. The cannibalism aspect of his charges, although shocking, was not necessarily the foremost issue of his guilt. People at that time were well- acquainted with the story of the ill-fated Donner Party, who had resorted to cannibalism during the winter of 1846‚Äì1847, and were understanding to a degree of the dire need to eat in the unforgiving wilderness. Additionally cannibalism was not, then or now, illegal per se in the United States unless one commits murder in order to obtain the flesh to be consumed. Even in such a case, the accused is charged with murder, with the cannibalism itself being charged as the desecration and/or abuse of a corpse. Packer would claim for the remainder of his life that he had been unjustly vilified and convicted for engaging in cannibalism rather than for cold-blooded murder, which he continued to deny ever having committed. In the end, it came down to the question; did five men die due to incompetence or greed? First trial On March 11, 1883, Packer was discovered by Jean \\"Frenchy\\" Cabazon in Cheyenne, Wyoming, living under the alias of \\"John Schwartze\\", one of the original members of the Utah mining party who stayed in Chief Ouray's camp in the winter of 1874. Cabazon was himself a member of the original party of men who left Provo, and wisely decided to stay put in Chief Ouray's camp, later safely making his way to their destination with Bob McGrue and Preston Nutter's party. He encountered Packer by chance when Packer approached him looking to buy some supplies. Cabazon reported Packer to the local sheriff, who apprehended him and contacted General Adams.The Mystery of Alfred Packer Retrieved September 22, 2017. He was summoned to Cheyenne where he confirmed Packer's identity and accompanied him by train to Denver for his second confession, which Packer signed on March 16. Packer stated that his main reason for fleeing was out of a fear of mob justice being exacted upon him by the populace of Saguache. Because the actual crime was committed within the confines of Hinsdale County, rather than neighboring Saguache County, Packer was accordingly sent to Lake City for detention and prosecution. Instead of claiming that the men were gradually eaten as they died until Bell killed Noon and Packer in turn killed Bell in self-defense, Packer now claimed that Bell had killed the others after Bell had told him to go scouting for any way out of the mountains and to find some food. He had been gone the better part of the day and returned in the late evening. Packer told General Adams: In the ensuing moments of shooting Bell and going for the hatchet, Packer dropped his revolver in the deep snow and subsequently lost it. He claimed he made himself a crude shelter out of stray logs to combat the snow and wind, aways down from the bodies. Another strong storm set in and he hunkered down for hours. He was starving and made the decision that he had to eat something or die. He continued: Adams asked Packer why he had not told him this story nine years previous, with Packer replying: \\"I was excited, I wanted to say something, and the story, as I told it, came first to my mind!\\" It was the argument of the prosecution that the only logical reason for Packer to have attempted such a perilous journey through the mountains with such minimal food and supplies was for the sole purpose to lead the men into the wilderness to both kill and rob them. At the time of Packer's trial, it was reported by the family of Israel Swan that he had left to go on the expedition with around $6,000 () in cash and gold, and that he also had a valuable Winchester rifle with him, which would give a strong motivation for murder, as well as his senior age of 65 at the time of his death. The other four members may have been either complicit in his murder and later betrayed by Packer, or were murdered by him for having been witnesses. Packer was not found with any gold on him at the time of his arrest, and although he did have money left, it did not total in the thousands. His spending had been frivolous. Nevertheless, on April 6, a trial began in Lake City. Packer pleaded not guilty. After seven days of testimonies and examinations, he was found guilty of the premeditated murder of Israel Swan, and sentenced to death by hanging, which was scheduled for May 19, 1883. It was presumed that Swan's death had occurred on, or around, the 1st of March. It was determined by the prosecution in court that Swan's remains showed signs of a struggle at the time of death, and that the others appeared to be killed in their sleep. Among those who testified on behalf of the prosecution were Otto Mears, Larry Dolan, Oliver D. Loutsenhizer, and Preston Nutter, who acted as the prosecution's key witness. According to a local newspaper, which received their quote from Larry Dolan, the presiding judge, M.B. Gerry, said: Court records present Judge Gerry's sentence as conventionally apolitical: Second trial Packer was spared the death penalty when his lawyers discovered that the murder statutes on the books for 1874 had been repealed and replaced with a \\"savings clause\\", which spared him being tried for murder on a technicality. In October 1885, the sentence was reversed by the Colorado Supreme Court being based on an ex post facto law. They had declared that the government could not sentence a man to death for committing a crime, if it had indeed occurred, before Colorado officially became a state as opposed to a territory. The overturning of his murder charge and scheduled execution did not spare Packer culpability for the men's deaths, however. A second trial was held in Gunnison following a change of venue for his hearing that was also granted per the Colorado Supreme Court as well as having a new Judge of Republican Party standing to preside, pursuant to Packer and his Counsel feeling as though the prejudices and pre-affirmed guilt within the community of Lake City (most of them Democrats), made it impossible for him to receive a fair and unbiased trial. He again pleaded not guilty. After a swift trial and even speedier verdict deliberation, on June 8, 1886, Packer was convicted of five counts of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 40 years in prison (8 years for each count, as well as the maximum sentence allowed per count). At the time, this was the longest custodial sentence in U.S. history. At the time of his second hearing, local hunters and officials made statements that although the winter of 1874 was one of the worst they had encountered for quite some time, the area of the San Juans where Packer and his party were camped was still plenty active with such large wild game as deer and antelope, as well as smaller game. There was even a report that the carcass of a deer was found near the campsite. This significantly damaged Packer's claims that the area was so scant with wildlife that the men had to resort to cannibalism quickly. Further emphasis was placed on the fact that Packer's choice to hike through the San Juan Mountains during the middle of winter, where snow depths can exceed more than six feet in a single downfall, coupled with blistering winds and freezing temperatures, was practically suicidal. He had been given a safe route to follow by locals that was next to a main water source that could have yielded fresh fish if nothing else as well as serve to keep them on course, but he perilously chose a mountain path with minimal supplies in the naive belief that it would be a faster route. In actuality, the route Packer and his companions took was nearly identical in length to the recommended route (though not in traverse), yet far more dangerous. Packer took the stand in his own defense. His version of the events that took place at the campsite remained relatively the same as his second official version. He made a request that he be charged the 40 years, but only for the death of Shannon Bell, who is the only man that Packer continued to claim he had killed, with the other deaths being beyond his control. His request was denied. He was sent to serve out his sentence at the Canon City Penitentiary. Parole Packer filed appeals on his case on five separate occasions and was roundly denied upon every submission. He sent letters to local newspapers stating he had been unjustly convicted by an unfair and unsympathetic judicial system, and by the ignorant conclusions and judgments of small-minded people. On June 19, 1899, Packer's sentence was officially upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court. Nevertheless, he was paroled on February 8, 1901, following a campaign that was initially spearheaded by an old acquaintance of Packer's named Duane Hatch, who petitioned for his release for nearly a decade before his labors came to the attention of Polly Pry. Packer had served 18 years of his 40-year sentence. An entrepreneurial and resourceful reporter for The Denver Post, Pry saw and appreciated the sensationalism of Packer's case and how his story and pre-existing reputation could generate a buzz. She used Packer's service in the Army as a basis to portray him as a common man of the people who got caught in a regrettable situation, a victim of circumstances who did what he had to do to survive, and a man who had essentially been crucified for violating civilized sensibilities by having to resort to cannibalism. Her stories on Packer led to a change of heart within the local businesses and people such that a series of petitions and requests made their way to the office of Colorado Governor Charles Thomas, which were still met with strong opposition. Thomas ultimately relented, and his last official act before leaving office was to parole, but not pardon, Packer under the agreement that he would not try to profit from his story. After his parole, Packer went to work as a guard at The Denver Post, and later as a ranch hand. His employment at The Denver Post came about, many believe, as a direct result of Pry and her employers securing his release. Packer had an endearing respect for Pry for his remaining years, and referred to her as his \\"Liberator\\". Death Alferd Packer died on April 23, 1907, aged 65, in Deer Creek, Jefferson County, Colorado. The cause of his death was cited as \\"Dementia ‚Äì trouble & worry\\", although his clinical cause of death has been described as the result of a stroke. Packer is today widely rumored to have become a vegetarian before his death and was reported by those who knew him as a man rich with stories and well-liked by children. He lived modestly and was reported to be a charitable man. =Remains= Packer was interred in Littleton, Colorado, with a full military burial. His grave is marked with a veteran's tombstone listing his original regiment in 1862, which is a replacement, as his original grave marker was stolen. His first name is listed as Alfred on his headstone, as opposed to the actual spelling of Alferd, but he is known to have gone by both in life. He was never successful in getting an official state pardon for his crimes. The Littleton Cemetery Association cemented over Packer's grave in 1973 to deter grave robbing and vandalism. Despite their belief that his corpse is intact, claims have been made by Edward Meyer, the Vice-President of Exhibits and Archives for the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum, that they are in possession of Packer's dissected skull, which they bought from an anonymous party for a reported sum of $20,000. No statement was made as to how they verified the authenticity of the skull, which is partially mummified, other than to state that the seller's information regarding its origin was sufficient. If the skull in question does belong to Packer, it is presumed that his head was removed from his body shortly before or after his burial, was then dissected with the brain being removed for study, and was then preserved through an arsenic curing process. It is then said to have fallen into the hands of a traveling sideshow, which displayed it, until it was later sold to a private party who in turn later sold it to Ripley's. As of 2008, the skull is reported to be at the Ripley's Museum in San Antonio, Texas, following its relocation from their New Orleans facility in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Later investigations On July 17, 1989, 115 years after Packer consumed his companions, an exhumation of the five bodies was undertaken by James E. Starrs, then a professor of law specializing in forensic science at George Washington University, following an exhaustive search for the precise location of the remains around the area of Cannibal Plateau. The men's remains were located at the end of a residential driveway of a home belonging to a local surgeon, and were only buried thirteen inches below ground level. Starrs and his colleague Walter H. Birkby concluded, regarding the cannibalism: \\"I don't think there will ever be any way to scientifically demonstrate cannibalism. Cannibalism per se is the ingestion of human flesh. So you'd have to have a picture of the guy actually eating.\\" Packer never denied cannibalism, so this was not the men's main intent for their investigation. The evidence uncovered was sufficient for Starrs to conclude that Packer had indeed murdered his comrades. Starrs came away with the belief that Packer more than likely murdered his companions for their belongings, and resorted to cannibalism out of necessity rather than intent. The men were re-interred and given a proper burial, complete with funeral rites being read. Exhumation of the skeletal remains showed signs of what appeared to be blunt force trauma to the skulls of two of the men, with no other noteworthy disturbance to their skeletal remains aside from those made during their butchering. All skulls had damage to varying extents to their upper craniums, with fabric fibers being found within some of the skulls themselves, suggesting that their heads were possibly covered with a blanket at the time of their deaths. The three other skeletons showed defensive signs of hacking marks across the radial and ulna bones of their forearms (Shannon Bell being one), which one could sustain whilst shielding their face and body from an attack. Although Packer claimed that Bell had murdered the others with hatchet blows to the head, in his second version of the story, he never claimed that he had to fight off Bell with the hatchet in any rendition. In one version of his story, Bell had charged at Packer with Swan's rifle, and Packer shot him. In Packer's second official version of the story, he claimed he finished off Bell with a hatchet blow to the head, but that was the extent of his claim in regards to the hatchet. All five of the skeletons had numerous differing post-mortem injuries to them, including depressed fractures, butterfly fractures, butchering trauma, and hacking trauma, which seems to contradict Packer's claims of \\"minimal cannibalism\\". Additionally, two other skeletons aside from that of Shannon Bell were found to have cylindrical puncture wounds in the pelvic bone, which has led some to question if all three marks are the result of the scavenging marks of a bear, or even possibly bullet wounds. No definitive conclusions have been made to these discoveries. This discovery has led some to hypothesize that a possible scenario is that two of the men were bludgeoned in their sleep by Packer, and the three remaining men awoke and Packer perhaps shot them in the hips to incapacitate them (if the punctures are in fact bullet wounds). They then attempted to fight off Packer who was wielding a hatchet. It is presumed that he then killed them all with blows to the head. He may then have butchered the men and used their flesh to survive in his snowbound state and during his journey. The differing states of decomposition of the bodies does contradict this theory, though probable. It would seem unlikely that Packer had shot three of the five men in the hip, which is not by itself an outright kill shot, unless it was to debilitate them while he went in for the kill. Further analysis into the entry and exit geometry could be telling as to what their initial cause was, but no such examination has been done to date. His ultimate motivation for their murder has been debated heavily, and has several possible theories. In 1994, David P. Bailey, Curator of History at the Museum of Western Colorado, undertook an investigation to turn up more conclusive results than Starrs' in regards to Packer's claims of having shot Bell. In the Audrey Thrailkill collection of firearms owned by the museum was a Colt revolver that had reportedly been found at the site of Packer's alleged crime. Exhaustive investigation into the pistol's background turned up documents from the time of the trial: \\"A Civil War veteran that visited the crime scene stated that Shannon Bell had been shot twice and the other victims were killed with a hatchet. Upon careful study of Bell, he noticed a severe bullet wound to the pelvic area and that Bell's wallet had a bullet hole through it.\\" This seems to corroborate Packer's claim that Bell had killed the other victims and that Packer shot Bell in self-defense. By 2000, Bailey had not yet proven a link between the antique pistol and Alferd Packer, but he discovered that forensic samples from the 1989 exhumation had been archived, and analysis in 2001 with an electron microscope by Dr. Richard Dujay at Mesa State College found microscopic lead fragments in the soil taken from under Shannon Bell's remains that were matched by spectrograph with the bullets remaining in what was indeed Packer's pistol. While it appears certain that at least Bell was shot, the question of whether or not it was in self-defense remains unanswered. As of 2019, nearly 145 years after the events, authors and law professors continue to debate the merits of Packer's guilt or innocence in relation to the outright murder of his party. Most have come to view Packer as guilty of the crimes based on the evidence discovered by Starrs in conjunction with Packer's own contradictions and retractions and his seeming inability to tell the truth, as well as the facts at hand. Whatever may have transpired in the mountains that ultimately led to the deaths of his companions, the fact remains that five men essentially walked into death by following a roundly unqualified man, who had presented himself as capable, into an extremely unforgiving environment with inadequate supplies. He had been given the opportunity to take good and exponentially safer directions, which would have absolved him of any further \\"guide\\" duties, but he let his false sense of security and pride steer his decision-making. The men who had followed him paid for his mistake, one way or the other, while he was fortunate enough to survive. George Noon did not even make his twentieth birthday before he died, Israel Swan was an elderly man close to the end of his work career, Frank Miller was a hard-working German immigrant, and Shannon Bell and James Humphrey were also hard-working men who simply wanted a better life. It is unlikely that the question of murder of his entire party will ever definitively be solved. In popular culture =Comics= In Bud Grace's comic strip The Piranha Club, one of the madcap denizens of Bayonne, New Jersey, is an old lady named \\"Alferda Packer, consumer advocate\\", who wages a humorously violent Carrie Nation-style crusade against unscrupulous business practices. One of her most frequent targets is her own son-in-law Dr. Enos Pork, a quack surgeon who bilks outrageous prices from his patients for the malpractice he performs on them. =Books= In Dashiell Hammett's hardboiled detective novel The Thin Man, Nick Charles advises Gilbert Wynant to read a selection about Packer's expeditions. The selection, from Thomas S. Duke's Celebrated Criminal Cases of America, gives Packer's first name as \\"Alfred\\". =Eateries and menus= In 1968, students at the University of Colorado Boulder named their new cafeteria grill the \\"Alferd G. Packer Memorial Grill\\", with the slogan, \\"Have a friend for lunch!\\" Students can order an \\"El Canibal\\" beefburger, and on the wall is a giant map outlining Packer's travels through Colorado. It has since been renamed the Alferd Packer Restaurant & Grill. thumb In 1977, the US Secretary of Agriculture, Bob Bergland, attempted to terminate a contract for the department's cafeteria food service but was prevented by the General Services Administration (GSA). To embarrass the GSA, Bergland and his employees convened a press conference on August 10, 1977, to unveil a plaque naming the executive cafeteria \\"The Alferd Packer Memorial Grill\\", announcing that Packer's life exemplified the spirit and fare of the cafeteria and would \\"serve all mankind\\". The event was covered on ABC-TV Evening News by Barbara Walters. The stratagem succeeded, and the contracts were terminated soon thereafter. Magnanimous in victory, Bergland yielded to the bureaucratic objection that the plaque lacked official GSA authorization and removed it. The plaque is currently displayed on the wall of the National Press Club's The Reliable Source members-only bar. It doubles as a memorial to Stanley Weston (1931‚Äì84), a man who worked at the USDA.(ref. telecon April 27, 2007, between Kurt Riegel & Bob Bergland). The Press Club's hamburger is called the \\"Alferd Packer Burger\\". The annual Philadelphia Folk Festival features a dining tent emblazoned with the tongue-in-cheek moniker: \\"The Alfred E. Packer Memorial Dining Hall...serving humanity since 1874\\". The Packer Saloon and Cannibal Grill is located in Lake City, CO. =Film and stage productions= University of Colorado students Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of South Park, made a musical comedy film called Cannibal! The Musical (1993), based loosely on Packer's life, with Parker billed as \\"Juan Schwartz\\" (a variation of Packer's \\"John Schwartze\\"). The film was released commercially in 1996 by Troma Entertainment and produced as a stage play, titled Alferd Packer: The Musical, initially by Dad's Garage Theatre Company and by several other theatre companies since. Lesser known film adaptions include The Legend of Alfred Packer (1980) and the horror film, Devoured: The Legend of Alferd Packer (2005). The 1999 Czech-American horror movie Ravenous is loosely based on the story of Alferd Packer. =Music= Folk singer Phil Ochs wrote the song \\"The Ballad of Alferd Packer\\" (1964), documenting the events of the expedition and its aftermath. Ochs' use of mor -the song is typical of the seemingly lighthearted ongoing attitude regarding Packer and his alleged crimes. Although the track never appeared on any of Ochs' studio or live album releases, it has appeared on several compilations issued since his death in 1976, most recently on the On My Way (2010) compilation of demos from 1963. Country artist C.W. McCall (of \\"Convoy\\" fame) recorded a track on his album The Real McCall titled \\"Coming Back for More\\" (1990), which revived the legend and implied that Packer's ghost still haunts Lake City. The American death metal band Cannibal Corpse dedicated their debut album, Eaten Back to Life (1990), to Packer. The following statement can be found in the inlay of this album: \\"This album is dedicated to the memory of Alfred Packer, the first American cannibal (R.I.P.)\\" Macabre, the self- proclaimed Murder-Metal band from Chicago, released a song about Packer's trek for gold called \\"In the Mountains\\" from their 2002 Morbid Campfire Songs album. Lawrence Kansas is the home of the Alferd Packer Memorial String Band. Their name is a tribute to Alferd Packer, and they have two songs about his cannibalistic tendencies. One talks about the crime itself, while the second, most recent, was written after the Colorado studies that showed Pacerd acted in self defense. =Podcasts= My Favorite Murder Episode 171.

Robinson was elected bishop coadjutor in 2003 and succeeded as bishop diocesan in March 2004. Before becoming bishop, he served as Canon to the Ordinary for the Diocese of New Hampshire. Robinson is widely known for being the first openly gay priest to be consecrated a bishop in a major Christian denomination believing in the historic episcopate, a matter of significant controversy. After his election, many theologically conservative Episcopalians in the United States abandoned the Episcopal Church, formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) and aligned themselves with bishops outside the Episcopal Church in the United States, a process called the Anglican realignment. His story has appeared in print and film. In 2010, Robinson announced his intention to retire in 2013 at 65. His successor is A. Robert Hirschfeld. Early life Robinson's parents were poor tenant farmers who worked in the tobacco fields as sharecroppers. The family used an outhouse, drew water from a cistern, and did laundry in a cast-iron tub over an open flame. Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby \\"Vicky Gene Robinson\\" for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson's father would tell him he couldn't take any joy in the boy's development because he always thought each step was going to be the last thing. Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious. Robinson had perfect Sunday School attendance for thirteen years. Education and marriage Robinson chose The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, in 1965 because they offered him a full scholarship. Robinson intended to study towards a medical degree but decided to major in American Studies. During his college days, Robinson began to seriously consider the ordained ministry and said it almost immediately felt right. During high school and then college, Robinson had been exploring philosophical and theological questions and has said, \\"The Episcopal Church got a hold on me.\\" He graduated from Sewanee cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies in 1969 and attended seminary that fall. Robinson studied for a Master of Divinity degree from the Episcopal General Theological Seminary in New York City. While doing an intern year as a chaplain at the University of Vermont, he began dating his future wife, Isabella \\"Boo\\" Martin. Robinson says that about \\"a month into their relationship, [he] explained his background and his fears about his sexuality.\\" They continued dating and, as Robinson puts it, \\"about a month before the marriage, [he] became frightened that ... this thing would raise its ugly head some day, and cause her and me great pain.\\" Robinson and Martin discussed it and decided to go ahead with the marriage in 1972. Early career and children Robinson received his degree in 1973 and was ordained a deacon in June 1973 at the cathedral of the diocese of Newark, New Jersey. He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was to start a business and ministry: in the winter it was called \\"The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center\\" and in the summer it became \\"Pony Farm\\". Boo still runs \\"Pony Farm\\" as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, \\"[T]hat is inextricably tied up with having children. And since I cannot imagine my life without Jamee and Ella, it's just a completely irrelevant question for me. And I don't regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It's just a part of my journey, and why would I possibly regret that?\\" Coming out and career Robinson came out to his and Boo's friends in 1986 and he sold his share in the business to Boo. They remained friends. In November 1987, Robinson met his partner, Mark Andrew, while on vacation in St. Croix. Andrew was also on vacation and worked in Washington, D.C., at the national office of the Peace Corps. On July 2, 1988, Robinson and Andrew moved into a new house in Weare, New Hampshire and had it blessed by Bishop Douglas Theuner, an event which they considered to be the formal recognition of their life together. Andrew currently works in the New Hampshire state government. He and Robinson were legally joined in June 2008 in a private civil union ceremony, followed by a religious ceremony, both in St Paul's Church, Concord. Earlier, Robinson had said, \\"I always wanted to be a June bride.\\" Robinson and Andrew ended their union in 2014. Robinson became Canon to the Ordinary in 1988, the executive assistant to the then bishop of New Hampshire, Douglas Theuner. Robinson remained in this job for the next seventeen years until he was elected bishop. Robinson and his daughters are very close. Ella actively helped her father with public relations at the General Convention in 2003. Just a week before the General Convention, Robinson had been with his daughter Jamee and held his four-hour-old first granddaughter. He now has two granddaughters. Election as bishop Robinson was elected bishop by the New Hampshire diocese on June 7, 2003, at St. Paul's Church in Concord. Thirty-nine clergy votes and 83 lay votes were the threshold necessary to elect a bishop in the Diocese of New Hampshire at that time. The clergy voted 58 votes for Robinson and the laity voted 96 for Robinson on the second ballot. The Episcopal Church requires in its Canon 16 that the election procedure and the candidate who is elected be subjected to review and must be consented to by the national church. No objections were raised to the procedure of the election. If diocesan election occurred within 120 days (3 months) of a General Convention, canon law requires consent by the House of Deputies and then the House of Bishops at the General Convention itself. Consent to the election of Robinson was given in August at the 2003 General Convention. The General Convention of 2003 became the center for debate over Robinson's election, as conservatives and liberals within the Church argued over whether Robinson should be allowed to become bishop. Some conservative factions threatened a schism within both the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion should Robinson be elected. Before the House of Deputies can vote on a resolution, a legislative committee must examine the piece of legislation first. The Committee on the Consecration of Bishops held a two-hour hearing on Robinson's election and supporters and opponents were allowed to speak. One of the speakers was Robinson's daughter, Ella, who read a letter from his ex-wife Boo in strong support of Robinson. The House of Deputies, which consists of laypersons and priests, voted in the affirmative: the laity voted 63 in favor, 32 opposed, and 13 divided; the clergy voted 65 in favor, 31 opposed, and 12 divided. Bishop Robinson in 2005 Robinson won the first two of three votes required for his election to be ratified, but allegations suddenly arose in August 2003 that Robinson had inappropriately touched a male parishioner and had connections with OutRight.org, which at the time carried a link to AllThingsBi.com, a resource site for bisexual people that included links to pornography sites. The final vote was postponed to address these last-minute charges. David W. Virtue, a critic of gay ordination, brought up the pornography allegation, claiming that: \\"Gene Robinson's website is linked by one click to 5,000 pornographic websites.\\" When no such link was found on the Diocese of New Hampshire web page profiling the bishop-elect, Virtue stated that the link was on the website of an organization Robinson supported. Robinson was already known to be associated with Outright, a secular organization for the support of young LGBT people. Fred Barnes, a Fox News commentator, repeated the allegations on the website of The Weekly Standard. On the day the allegations arose, the website issued a press release stating that it had removed the offending link, that it had been unaware of the pornographic links on allthingsbi.com, and that Robinson had no involvement with that particular chapter of Outright. The male parishioner of Manchester, Vermont (in a diocese neighboring Robinson's) who had alleged the \\"touching\\", was then reported to have said, during the investigating committee's telephone call with him, that the acts in question were two separate occasions of what felt to him like intentionally seductive arm-squeezing and back-stroking, although in a public setting. The man acknowledged that others might have regarded the two incidents as \\"natural,\\" yet the incidents were disturbing to him nonetheless. The investigating committee's report also stated that man regretted having used the word \\"harassment\\" in his e-mail, and that man declined an invitation to bring formal charges. After a two-day investigation, neither allegation proved of merit. The House of Bishops voted for Robinson in the affirmative, with 62 in favor, 43 opposed, and 2 abstaining. Consecration as bishop The election in New Hampshire, like all elections of bishops in the Episcopal Church, was done by a synodical election process, unlike many other parts of the Anglican Communion where bishops are appointed. This detail would be misunderstood when the international commentary following Robinson's election suggested he should voluntarily step down or be asked to do so. The Jeffrey John case in the Church of England is the best example to contrast the election of bishops with the appointment of bishops. Jeffrey John is an openly gay priest living in a long-standing celibate relationship (he self-identifies as celibate) and was appointed as a bishop. One person alone, Richard Harries, then Bishop of Oxford, had the authority to appoint the Bishop of Reading (an area bishop in Oxford diocese); though new bishops are customarily consecrated by the archbishop. Rowan Williams, then Archbishop of Canterbury, however, allegedly persuaded Harries to not proceed with the appointment. This precedent would be used by the wider Anglican Communion to pressure Robinson. Robinson said that \\"there was not a single bishop involved in the choosing of me to be Bishop of New Hampshire.\\" The Elections and Transitions Committee arranged for the Whittemore Center to be used for the consecration, a large hockey rink on the campus of the University of New Hampshire in Durham. The numbers expected were about 3,000 people, 300 press, a 200 strong choir, and 48 bishops. The security was strong: just as Barbara Harris had to wear a bullet-proof vest at her consecration, Robinson was showing his bullet-proof vest to Harris herself. Robinson's parents, sister, daughter and their families and his ex- wife Boo were all at the consecration. Robinson was consecrated on November 2, 2003, in the presence of Frank Griswold, Presiding Bishop, and six co- consecrating bishops: 48 bishops in all. Robinson's election and consecration prompted a group of 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, to make a statement warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that \\"[it] will inevitably have a significant impact on the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be.\\" He added: \\"[I]t is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response.\\" Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what \\"all the fuss\\" was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church. Episcopate Episcopal Church Reports from Britain describe how Robinson has received death threats, had to wear bulletproof vests, and needed protection since his election and consecration. In February 2006, Robinson was treated at an inpatient rehabilitation facility to deal with his \\"increasing dependence on alcohol\\". Diocesan officials were surprised by the news and asserted that they did not notice his alcoholism affect his ministry in any way. The Episcopal Church, through its General Convention, has long recognized alcoholism as a treatable human disease, not a failure of character or will. The members of the Standing Committee issued a statement fully supporting Robinson. He returned to work in March 2006. Robinson was featured prominently in a documentary film entitled For the Bible Tells Me So, which screened at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. He has opposed the Roman Catholic ban on homosexual seminarians, stating: \\"I find it so vile that they think they are going to end the child abuse scandal by throwing out homosexuals from seminaries.\\" Due to the controversy surrounding his consecration, Bishop Robinson was not invited to the 2008 Lambeth Conferences by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. A group of conservative bishops (including Akinola and Duncan) who opposed Robinson's consecration gathered in Jerusalem one month prior to Lambeth 2008, at the Global Anglican Future Conference, an event which is perceived by some as schismatic. Robinson did however visit the United Kingdom privately in July 2008, during which he participated in a film screening and question and answer session with Sir Ian McKellen at the Royal Festival Hall, and was invited to preach at St Mary's Putney, events which attracted much media attention. The sermon was interrupted by a heckler who was then escorted out of the service. Robinson asked the rest of the congregation, most of whom greeted the interruption with slow-clapping, to \\"pray for that man\\", before completing his sermon. The Primate of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, Archbishop Daniel Deng Bul, on July 22 at a public press conference during the 2008 Lambeth Conference called for Robinson to resign, and for all those who had participated in his consecration to confess their sin to the conference. In 2009 Robinson was selected to deliver the invocation at the kickoff event of President Barack Obama's inaugural weekend. Despite his extended involvement with Obama during the campaign, his selection was widely discussed as an effort to counterbalance the role of the choice of evangelical pastor Rick Warren. Media outlets noted Warren compared the legitimization of same-sex marriage to the legalization of \\"incest, polygamy or 'an older guy marrying a child'\\".\\"Obama's choice of Rick Warren to lead prayer dismays Hollywood liberals\\" by Tina Daunt, LA Times, December 20, 2009.\\"Obama's Choice of Pastor Creates Furor\\" by Jeff Zeleny and David D.

Warren also supported California Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state.

Neither HBO's exclusive live broadcast, nor the Presidential Inauguration Committee's blog of the event included the invocation, but the prepared text was posted in full on the website of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire, and video shot informally by attendees was posted on YouTube. National Public Radio, which relied on the HBO feed that omitted it, broadcast a recording the following day with an interview of Robinson about its limited exposure; in that venue, Robinson described it as conforming to the four-fold Franciscan prayer model. According to the Washington Blade, it was the Presidential Inaugural Committee that made the decision for the prayer to be a part of the pre-show and not the show, itself, with a spokesman from that committee maintaining the prayer was dropped through an unspecified \\"error.\\" Some gay activists maintain that this was a slight on the part of the Obama administration.Why gay bishop's prayer didn't air on HBO music special, January 19, 2009, San Francisco Chronicle. In April 2009, Robinson made the Out magazine Third Annual Power 50 list of the most influential gay men and women in the USA, landing at number 7. In August 2009, Gene Robinson was a key speaker at the 2009 Greenbelt Festival, held at Cheltenham Racecourse, Gloucestershire, England. Here he delivered three talks, each garnering an attendance in the thousands, based not only on his views of Christianity and homosexuality, but also on human sexuality in general and the rights of LGBT members of society. The three talks were entitled \\"Homosexuality: What the Bible says & why it matters\\", \\"Keeping your cool in the eye of the storm\\" and \\"Sexuality and spirituality: keeping them together\\". As well as these three talks, Gene Robinson made a big impact on some gay and lesbian festival-goers by leading them collectively in prayer on the second night of the festival as part of a small group. In 2009 he was given the Stephen F. Kolzak Media Award. In 2012, Macky Alston priemeried a Documentary about Robinson, Love Free or Die: How the Bishop of New Hampshire is Changing the World, it was screened at Sundance Film Festival.  Since retirement  After resigning as bishop of New Hampshire in 2013, Robinson moved to Washington, D.C. to join the Center for American Progress as a senior fellow and serve as bishop-in-residence at St. Thomas' Parish. In 2014, Robinson and his husband Mark Andrew divorced. In 2017, Robinson was named Vice-President and Senior Pastor of the Chautauqua Institution, a center for arts, education, recreation and religion in upstate New York.

Possessing a charismatic attitude and rather dashing good-looks, as well as a genuine talent for his art, Somers earned the unofficial title of \\"Darling of Canadian Composition.\\" A truly patriotic artist, Somers was engaged in many national projects over the course his lifetime. He was a founding member of the Canadian League of Composers (CLC) and as such, was involved in the formation of other Canadian music organizations, including the Canada Council for the Arts and the Canadian Music Centre. He frequently received commissions from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Canada Council for the Arts. Biography =Early life= Somers was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on September 11, 1925. Unlike most composers, Somers did not become involved in formal musical study at all until he reached his teens in 1939, when he met a doctor and his wife who were both accomplished amateur pianists and they introduced him to classical music. When describing this first encounter years later, Somers stated that \\"A spark was ignited and I became obsessed with music. Almost from that instant I knew music would be my life, for better or for worse.\\" =Musical education= The 14-year-old Somers began his intensive study of piano almost immediately after this first exposure under the tutelage of Dorothy Hornfelt, the neighbourhood piano teacher. After two short years of study with her, he was able to pass the grade VIII examination of the Toronto Conservatory. In 1942, Somers began studying under Reginald Godden at the conservatory, whom he stayed with until 1943. It was Godden who recognized Somers' talent for composition and directed him to pursue formal studies under John Weinzweig. Weinzweig‚Äôs avant garde methods of compositions were well-suited to Somers‚Äô budding innovative style. It was Weinzweig who set up a program of traditional harmony study for the young composer as well as introducing him to 12-tone techniques. (Schoenberg had enforced similarly strict lessons in traditional harmony upon his own pupils, even as he encouraged them to explore dodecaphony.) Somers remained under Weinzweig‚Äôs instruction until 1949. Somers took a brief sabbatical from his studies in 1943 to serve with the Royal Canadian Armed Forces in World War II. After WWII, Somers returned to the Royal Conservatory to continue his studies with Weinzweig ‚Äì culminating with a suite for string orchestra ‚Äì North Country (1948) ‚Äì and a new piano teacher, Weldon Kilburn. During this time, Somers was writing and performing his own works and had every intention of being both a classical pianist and a composer. Somers completed his studies at the conservatory in 1948 and then spent the summer in San Francisco studying piano under E. Robert Schmitz. His work was part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Despite his great talent and promise as a classical pianist, by 1949, Somers had decided to give up his piano studies and channel his efforts solely into composition. It was also in 1949 that he was awarded a $2000 Canadian Amateur Hockey Association scholarship that enabled him to spend the year in Paris studying composition with Darius Milhaud. It was there that Somers heard the music of Boulez and Messiaen. These composers would influence his later music. =1950s and 1960s= After his year with Darius Milhaud, Somers spent the 1950s devoted to composition. While he was composing prolifically, he was not yet able to support himself financially and instead, he earned his income as a music copyist. Yet this occupation was not without benefit to Somers; it allowed him to develop the pristine and meticulous penmanship his manuscripts were renowned for later in his career. Somers also took the time during the 1950s to become a very accomplished guitar player and used the skill as yet another way to earn money. The 1960s proved to be a pivotal decade in Somers‚Äô career. He became more involved in diverse aspects of the Canadian music scene and his career as a composer finally took off. Although he had struggled to make a living on his compositions prior to this point in his career, this was the decade in which Somers no longer needed to hold a permanent position at any establishment and instead was able to live off of his commissions alone. He began the decade by returning to Paris for more compositional studies, thanks to a Canada Council for the Arts fellowship. While there, he concentrated on Gregorian chant, particularly its revival by the Solesmes Abbey. When he returned to Canada, Somers became interested in how young people were being exposed to and educated about Canadian music. He sought to improve upon their education via a number of different methods. In 1963, he became a member of the John Adaskin Project, which was an in-school initiative involving the teaching and performance of Canadian music in schools. Also in 1963, Somers began his part- time career with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation by hosting televised youth concerts. 1963 also brought sadness to Somers life when his first wife, Catherine Mackie, died. In 1965, Somers began hosting the CBC radio series, 'Music of Today' and continued hosting it until 1969. He also became the special consultant of the North York School in Toronto from 1968-9. In 1967 he remarried, to the Canadian actress Barbara Chilcott. This was also the year that he produced his best known work, the opera Louis Riel, commissioned for Canada‚Äôs Centennial Year celebrations. Somers ended the decade as he began it; studying composition in Europe. In 1969, he received an $18 000 grant from the Canadian Cultural Institute in Rome. He spent two years there, during which time he wrote his famous works for voice: Voiceplay and Kyrie. =1970s and 1980s= If the 1960s was the decade wherein Somers proved himself as a composer, the 1970s were the years wherein the rest of Canada honoured him for that achievement. In 1971, after he returned to Canada from his work in Rome, Somers was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, due to his national and international recognition as a composer. He was awarded three honorary doctorates; one from the University of Ottawa (1975), one from York University (1975) and one from the University of Toronto (1976). In 1977, Somers made a visit to the USSR. While there, he heard many of his pieces performed, gave lectures on Contemporary Canadian composition, and spoke to other contemporary composers. During the 1980s, Somers was kept very busy, receiving many commissions for numerous national music events and organizations, including the Banff International String Quartet Competition, the Guelph Spring Festival, the S.C. Eckhardt-Gramatt√© Competition and the Canadian Opera Company. =1990s= By the time he reached the 1990s, Somers had indisputably cemented his reputation as one of the greatest composers Canada had ever produced. As such, he was permitted to be more selective of who he chose to compose for in his old age and showed preference for his favourite artists. Despite his age, Somers still kept active within the Canadian and international music communities, giving the opening address at the Alberta Music Conference in 1993, writing a choral piece for the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations in 1995 and serving as the writer-in-residence for the first \\"Word and Music Festival\\" held at the University of Windsor in 1997. Canada honoured him in 1995 with tribute concerts given by the University of Ottawa and the National Arts Centre for his 70th birthday. Somers died on March 9, 1999, in Toronto, Ontario. Composer Harry Somers was immensely successful as a composer. He had an eclectic, personal approach to 20th century styles and composed a large body of work that walked a fine line between an elite modernity and popular appeal. His works were performed nationally and internationally during his lifetime, with performances in the USA, Central and South Americas, Europe and the Soviet Union. His output consisted essentially of tonal works that incorporated elements of atonality later on in his career. Somers described his approach to composition as follows: :::\\"Over the years I've worked consistently on three different levels with three different approaches to composition. On one level my approach has been what I call 'community music' or 'music for use': For example music for amateurs and music for school use. On a second level I've created 'functional music,' in the specific sense: music for television, films and theatre, where the composition has to work in company with another medium and serve the demands of that medium. On a third level I have created without consideration for any limitations, sometimes completely experimentally, sometimes extending the line of a particular direction on which I had been working through a series of works. :::In short, the first two levels relate directly to the environment and society, in the broad sense, in which I live at the moment, and in which I function as a craftsman; the third relates to a more restricted audience (though I'm not convinced it need be so) and my personal development as an artist.\\" =Style= Somers music is known for its diversity of influences and themes. Due to the isolated nature of Toronto during the 20th century, the city in which he first began composing, Somers was fortunate enough to develop his own sense of originality before he began his formal compositional studies. Once he began studying at the Royal Conservatory, his sources of influence increased and his musical palate grew as well. The people and styles that are said to have influence him the most are the music of Weinzweig, Bart√≥k and Ives, Baroque counterpoint, serial technique and Gregorian chant. Somers himself said that he aimed to \\"unify conceptions of the Baroque ‚Ä¶ with the high tensioned elements of our own time\\" in many of his compositions. Somers also makes great and unique use of dynamics. He developed a technique for creating what he referred to as ‚Äòdynamic unrest‚Äô which consists of one sound sustained, be it chord or singular pitch, isolated or prolonged in a melodic line, developing a dynamic envelope of its own. It was under the guidance of Weinzweig during the 1940s that Somers received his first formal instruction in composition. Prior to that point, he composed mainly in the style of the piano works he was playing, but with a notable creative spark. With Weinzweig, this spark was fanned into a flame and Somers‚Äô compositional style refined. He began working with thinner textures, developed a more horizontally orientated approach to his pieces and established control over motivic coherence. These developments can be seen most clearly in the outer movements of North Country (1948), a four-movement suite for string orchestra. In this work, Somers uses \\"nervous rhythmic vitality, sparse textures in a relatively dissonant context and lean melodic lines in a high register (often contrasting sharply with a driving ostinato-like accompaniment) [to] subtly evoke the bleakness, loneliness and strength of the northern Ontario landscape.\\" During the 1950s Somers focused on two main ideas in his compositions: the use of fugue-related textures and techniques, and the use of different styles and techniques within the same work. Well over half of the works written between 1950 and 1961 contain fugal movements or sections. Many more feature \\"sharp, nervous, rhythmic vitality, which often serves as a foil for slower-moving subsidiary melodic lines.\\" Demonstrations of these ideas can be heard in his Passacaglia and Fugue (1954), the last section of String Quartet no.3 and the second sections of Five Concepts. =Serialism= Somers‚Äôs approach to serialism was intuitive and always kept within the realm of accessibility. When he began his studies with Weinzweig, Somers dabbled in the use of serialism in his music, but he refrained from drastically implementing it into his pieces until 1950. Even then, it was never the main aspect of his work, but rather acted as supportive material for other elements. Prior to 1959, he tended to keep sections that included serial elements contained within tonal confines. It wasn't until the beginning of the 1960s that Somers began to broaden his scope, increasing his experimentation with non-thematic textures and with the visual and spatial aspects of performance. =Instrumental works= Many of Somers‚Äô instrumental works are classics of Canadian music. The style and innovations they display \\"document the efforts of a generation to break away from the traditional language of older, European-trained colleagues.\\" Some of Somers‚Äô most notable instrumental works include: *Suite for harp and chamber orchestra (1949) *Symphony no.1 (1951) *Passacaglia and Fugue (1954) *Fantasia for Orchestra (1958) *Five Concepts for Orchestra (1961) *Twelve Miniatures (1963) *Stereophony (1963): a piece commissioned by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Often regarded as one of his most important and original orchestral score, it displays many elements of his earlier writing. It is performed by two string orchestras on the platform, with musicians scattered throughout the performance space and thus it is deliberately impossible to achieve synchronization. *Picasso Suite (1964). *Movement for String Quartet (1982) *Elegy, Transformation, Jubilation(1981) =Operatic and vocal works= Somers composed many popular operatic, choral and chamber works. Exploring and experimenting with new vocal techniques was one of his main compositional focuses from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. His resulting works includes techniques such as vocalization, vowel and breath sounds, and timbral inflections. Some of Somers‚Äô most notable works for voice include: *The Fool (1953). A one-act chamber opera. *Twelve Miniatures (1964) *Evocations (1966) *Crucifixion (1966) *Louis Riel (1967). Commissioned for the Canadian Centennial. Somers only work to feature electronic sounds (used in the battle scene in Act 1). *Five Songs of the Newfoundland Outports (1969) shows him clearly working within the choral mainstream. These five accessible arrangements of Newfoundland folk songs have become popular with choirs around the world. *Voiceplay (1971) *Kyrie (1971) Notes References * Canadian League of Composers.

The story follows Hitoshi K≈çbe, a high school guy who isn't good at anything but programming. He creates a program in particular named Program 30 which is that of a female, and is shocked when she comes to life in the real world due to a lightning storm. Hitoshi names her Saati and teaches her about the real world, while she instructs him on how to properly have a girlfriend. Things get more complex however when two more of Hitoshi's programs come to life, and a hacker goes after Saati's program. A.I. Love You was first serialized through Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine in 1994, but later moved to Magazine Special where it ended in 1997. The series was collected into nine manga volumes that were also released by Kodansha between 1994 and 1997. Two re-releases followed; however, each time a volume was deducted. In 2003, Tokyopop acquired the license to release the series in North America. The story's title was changed but Tokyopop tried to keep a pun that had been used in the original Japanese title. Eight English language manga volumes were released between February 3, 2004, and April 12, 2005. The volumes were printed until 2009 when Tokyopop announced that the series would go out of print. The English adaptation was well received, and although reviewers pointed out that Akamatsu's artwork was not at the professional level yet, they praised the story and characters. Plot The story centres on Hitoshi K≈çbe, a guy who is neither academically gifted nor good at sports, so he does not do very well at school. Hitoshi has only one thing going for him - his ability to program computers. In fact, he is so good at this he has created programs that can rewrite themselves - Artificial Intelligence, in other words. So far he has created thirty of these programs, and the latest - whom he names Saati ( The Japanese pronunciation of the English word \\"Thirty\\" )- is so advanced that conversation with her is indistinguishable from a normal girl. However, there is still the barrier of Hitoshi being in the physical world and Saati being a program, until one day a freak lightning strike materializes her into the real world, where she becomes the girlfriend of Hitoshi. The series then follows their now not so ordinary lives, as well as other A.I.s of Hitoshi's creation. Release A.I. Love You was first serialized through manga magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine in 1994 starting in the 18th issue, and going until Issue 40. Kodansha later switched the serialization to Magazine Special where the series ended in 1997. In the same year as the series debut, the first manga for the series was released on September 16, 1994. The series spanned nine volumes, and was concluded on October 17, 1997. The series was subsequently re-released by Kodansha through KC Deluxe from November, 1999 to June, 2000 this time though with eight volumes. The final re-release took place between November 17, 2004, and June 17, 2005 again by Kodansha, but with seven volumes. In June 2003, A.I. Love You showed up on Tokyopop's website but was removed shorty after. Tokyopop announced a month later though at Anime Expo 2003 that it had officially licensed the series for an English language release in North America. The first volume released came out on February 3, 2004, altogether eight volumes were released. Tokyopop released the final volume on April 12, 2005, and continued printing the series up until August 31, 2009 when it was announced that all eight volumes would be out of print. Although discontinued, the company offered returns for those who desired up until March 1, 2010. The discontinuation was a result of Kodansha letting its licenses expire with Tokyopop which led to the removal of some of company's biggest titles. Naming The original Japanese title, A„ÉªI „ÅåÊ≠¢„Åæ„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ! (A.I. ga Tomaranai!), is a play on words. While it roughly means \\"Cant Stop Love\\" the word \\"A.I.\\" has several meanings. Besides being the acronym for artificial intelligence, it is also the Japanese word for and the Japanese transcription of the English word . Tokyopop does their best to recreate this pun with their US release of the series in which this case they added \\"Love You\\" to create a pun referring to the statement \\"I Love You\\" in A.(I. Love You). Reception The English language adaptation of the manga series has received reviews from various media outlets that provide feedback, and reception in regards to manga. Samantha from Manga Life gave the first book an A rating calling it a \\"very deep series\\". When talking about the characters she says that they all have bright personalities, and are overall loveable. Allen Divers from Anime News Network also gave the first volume a review calling the story predictable. Allen goes on to say though that the simple love story aside from the fan service \\"can keep the ladies happy as well\\". In his review of the first volume, Mike Dungan from Mania.com called the story \\"amateurish\\" saying that they have predictable plots to them. Mike praises the English release though for being far better when it comes to the artwork, and design than the original Japanese release. He finishes his review saying that while the artwork isn't yet at the Love Hina level, (This was Akamatsu's first manga) Ken's fans \\"won't want to do without it\\" citing the evolution of Akamatsu's artwork.

This has been put forward as a demonstration that ley lines and other similar mysterious alignments believed by some to be phenomena of deep significance might exist solely due to chance alone, as opposed to the supernatural or anthropological explanations put forward by their proponents. The topic has also been studied in the fields of computer vision and astronomy. A number of studies have examined the mathematics of alignment of random points on the plane.\\"Alignments in Two-Dimensional Random Sets of Points\\" David G. Kendall and Wilfrid S. Kendall Advances in Applied Probability Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jun., 1980), pp. 380-424 Published by: Applied Probability Trust Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1426603 In all of these, the width of the line - the allowed displacement of the positions of the points from a perfect straight line - is important. It allows the fact that real-world features are not mathematical points, and that their positions need not line up exactly for them to be considered in alignment. Alfred Watkins, in his classic work on ley lines The Old Straight Track, used the width of a pencil line on a map as the threshold for the tolerance of what might be regarded as an alignment. For example, using a 1 mm pencil line to draw alignments on a 1:50,000 Ordnance Survey map, the corresponding width on the ground would be 50 m.  Estimate of probability of chance alignments  Contrary to intuition, finding alignments between randomly placed points on a landscape gets progressively easier as the geographic area to be considered increases. One way of understanding this phenomenon is to see that the increase in the number of possible combinations of sets of points in that area overwhelms the decrease in the probability that any given set of points in that area line up. One definition which expresses the generally accepted meaning of \\"alignment\\" is: :A set of points, chosen from a given set of landmark points, all of which lie within at least one straight path of a given width More precisely, a path of width w may be defined as the set of all points within a distance of w/2 of a straight line on a plane, or a great circle on a sphere, or in general any geodesic on any other kind of manifold. Note that, in general, any given set of points that are aligned in this way will contain a large number of infinitesimally different straight paths. Therefore, only the existence of at least one straight path is necessary to determine whether a set of points is an alignment. For this reason, it is easier to count the sets of points, rather than the paths themselves. The number of alignments found is very sensitive to the allowed width w, increasing approximately proportionately to wk-2, where k is the number of points in an alignment. The following is a very approximate order-of-magnitude estimate of the likelihood of alignments, assuming a plane covered with uniformly distributed \\"significant\\" points. Consider a set of n points in a compact area with approximate diameter L and area approximately L2. Consider a valid line to be one where every point is within distance w/2 of the line (that is, lies on a track of width w, where w ‚â™ L). Consider all the unordered sets of k points from the n points, of which there are: :\\\\binom nk = \\\\frac {n!} {(n-k)!\\\\,k!} (see factorial and binomial coefficient for notation). To make a rough estimate of the probability that any given subset of k points is approximately collinear in the way defined above, consider the line between the \\"leftmost\\" and \\"rightmost\\" two points in that set (for some arbitrary left/right axis: we can choose top and bottom for the exceptional vertical case). These two points are by definition on this line. For each of the remaining k-2 points, the probability that the point is \\"near enough\\" to the line is roughly w/L, which can be seen by considering the ratio of the area of the line tolerance zone (roughly wL) and the overall area (roughly L2). So, the expected number of k-point alignments, by this definition, is very roughly: : \\\\frac {n!} {(n-k)!\\\\,k!} \\\\left({\\\\frac{w}{L}}\\\\right)^{k-2} Among other things this can be used to show that, contrary to intuition, the number of k-point lines expected from random chance in a plane covered with points at a given density, for a given line width, increases much more than linearly with the size of the area considered, since the combinatorial explosion of growth in the number of possible combinations of points more than makes up for the increase in difficulty of any given combination lining up.  More precise estimate of expected number of alignments  A more precise expression for the number of 3-point alignments of maximum width w and maximum length d expected by chance among n points placed randomly on a square of side L is Edmunds, M.G. & George, G.H., Random Alignment of Quasars, Nature, vol. 290, pages 481-483, 1981 April 9 : \\\\mu = \\\\frac {\\\\pi } {3} \\\\frac {w}{L} \\\\left( {\\\\frac {d}{L}} \\\\right)^{3} n \\\\left( n-1 \\\\right) \\\\left( n-2 \\\\right) If edge effects (alignments lost over the boundaries of the square) are included, then the expression becomes : \\\\mu = \\\\frac {\\\\pi } {3} \\\\frac {w}{L} \\\\left( {\\\\frac {d}{L}} \\\\right)^{3} n \\\\left( n-1 \\\\right) \\\\left( n-2 \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac {3}{\\\\pi } \\\\left( \\\\frac {d}{L} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\frac {3}{5} \\\\left( \\\\frac {4}{\\\\pi } - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac {d}{L} \\\\right)^{2} \\\\right) A generalisation to k-point alignments (ignoring edge effects) is : \\\\mu = \\\\frac {\\\\pi n \\\\left( n-1 \\\\right) \\\\left( n-2 \\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left( n - \\\\left( k-1 \\\\right) \\\\right) } {k \\\\left( k-2 \\\\right) !} \\\\left( \\\\frac {w}{L} \\\\right)^{k-2} \\\\left( {\\\\frac {d}{L}} \\\\right)^{k} which has roughly similar asymptotic scaling properties as the crude approximation in the previous section, with combinatorial explosion for large n overwhelming the effects of other variables.  Computer simulation of alignments  607 4-point alignments of 269 random points Computer simulations show that points on a plane tend to form alignments similar to those found by ley hunters in numbers consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates above, suggesting that ley lines may also be generated by chance. This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the points are generated pseudo-randomly by computer, or from data sets of mundane features such as pizza restaurants or telephone booths. It is easy to find alignments of 4 to 8 points in reasonably small data sets with w = 50 m. Choosing large areas or larger values of w makes it easy to find alignments of 20 or more points.

This interaction is considered social whether they are aware of it or not, and whether the interaction is voluntary or involuntary. Etymology The word \\"Social\\" derives from the Latin word socii (\\"allies\\"). It is particularly derived from the Italian Socii states, historical allies of the Roman Republic (although they rebelled against Rome in the Social War of 91-88 BC). +201098838419 Social theorists In the view of Karl MarxMorrison, Ken. Marx, Durkheim, Weber. Formations of modern social thought, human beings are intrinsically, necessarily and by definition social beings who, beyond being \\"gregarious creatures\\", cannot survive and meet their needs other than through social co-operation and association. Their social characteristics are therefore to a large extent an objectively given fact, stamped on them from birth and affirmed by socialization processes; and, according to Marx, in producing and reproducing their material life, people must necessarily enter into relations of production which are \\"independent of their will\\". By contrast, the sociologist Max Weber for example defines human action as \\"social\\" if, by virtue of the subjective meanings attached to the action by individuals, it \\"takes account of the behavior of others, and is thereby oriented in its course\\". In socialism The term \\"socialism\\", used from the 1830s onwards in France and the United Kingdom, was directly related to what was called the social question. In essence, early socialists contended that the emergence of competitive market societies did not create \\"liberty, equality and fraternity\\" for all citizens, requiring the intervention of politics and social reform to tackle social problems, injustices and grievances (a topic on which Jean-Jacques Rousseau discourses at length in his classic work The Social Contract). Originally the term \\"socialist\\" was often used interchangeably with \\"co-operative\\", \\"mutualist\\", \\"associationist\\" and \\"collectivist\\" in reference to the organization of economic enterprise socialists advocated, in contrast to the private enterprise and corporate organizational structures inherent to capitalism. The modern concept of socialism evolved in response to the development of industrial capitalism. The \\"social\\" in modern \\"socialism\\" came to refer to the specific perspective and understanding socialists had of the development of material, economic forces and determinants of human behavior in society. Specifically, it denoted the perspective that human behavior is largely determined by a person's immediate social environment, that modes of social organization were not supernatural or metaphysical constructs but products of the social system and social environment, which were in turn products of the level of technology/mode of production (the material world), and were therefore constantly changing. Social and economic systems were thus not the product of innate human nature, but of the underlying form of economic organization and level of technology in a given society, implying that human social relations and incentive-structures would also change as social relations and social organization changes in response to improvements in technology and evolving material forces (relations of production). This perspective formed the bulk of the foundation for Karl Marx's materialist conception of history. Modern uses In contemporary society, \\"social\\" often refers to the redistributive policies of the government which aim to apply resources in the public interest, for example, [social security]. Policy concerns then include the problems of social exclusion and social cohesion. Here, \\"social\\" contrasts with \\"private\\" and to the distinction between the public and the private (or privatised) spheres, where ownership relations define access to resources and attention. The social domain is often also contrasted with that of physical nature, but in sociobiology analogies are drawn between humans and other living species in order to explain social behavior in terms of biological factors.

The discourse was presented to a congregation of about twenty thousand Latter Day Saints at a general conference held shortly after the funeral service of Elder King Follett, who had died on March 9, 1844, of accidental injuries. The sermon is notable for its claim that God was once a mortal man, and that mortal men and women can become gods (a concept commonly called divinization) through salvation and exaltation. These topics were, and are, controversial, and have received varying opinions and interpretations of what Smith meant. Literary critic Harold Bloom called the sermon \\"one of the truly remarkable sermons ever preached in America.\\" Text A full, verbatim account of the speech does not exist, but notes exist, taken contemporaneously, by Thomas Bullock (using a type of personal shorthand), William Clayton (writing in longhand), and Willard Richards (taking \\"minute\\"-style notes of major elements of the speech).. Wilford Woodruff also took extensive contemporaneous notes and transferred the notes to his journal with editorializations, but his original notes were not preserved. One author (Searle) estimates that the surviving notes of the sermon contain roughly 30% of the words of the actual address, but that together, they are likely nearly topically complete.. A version reconstructed (by Bullock) from the Bullock and Clayton records was published in the church paper Times and Seasons of August 15, 1844. A later version resulted from amalgamation of the Richards, Woodruff, Bullock and Clayton texts. This amalgamation was done by church employee Jonathan Grimshaw roughly ten years after Smith's death and is generally regarded as the \\"official\\" LDS Church version because it was carefully reviewed, edited, and approved by LDS authorities including Brigham Young.. It contains some text not found in any of the primary sources and contains redundancies resulting from the na√Øve reconstruction. These redundancies, and the parts added by Grimshaw without support in the contemporaneous notes, were removed in a modern amalgamation by Stan Larson in 1978. Attitude of Latter-day Saint leaders The sermon was not always viewed in a favorable light by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)BYU Studies, vol. 18(1977‚Äì1978): p. 191 or other denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement. It was not published in the LDS Church's 1912 History of the Church because of then- Church President Joseph F. Smith's discomfort with some ideas in the sermon popularized by the editor of the project, B. H. Roberts of the First Council of the Seventy.J. Stapley, \\"A Textual History of the KFD, Part II.\\" By 1950, it was included in the revised edition of History of the Church. In 1971, the sermon was published in the Ensign, an official publication of the LDS Church. LDS Church President Lorenzo Snow succinctly summarized a portion of the doctrine explained in this discourse using a couplet, which is often repeated within the church: Topics Doctrinal topics in the sermon include: * the fundamental nature of reality ‚Äî :man is not a contingent being, moreover God made the world from preexisting \\"chaotic matter.\\" :\\"I take my ring from my finger and liken it unto the mind of man ... because it has no beginning\\" :\\"The pure principles of element, are principles that can never be destroyed.\\"Times and Seasons, 5:615. * the character and nature of God ‚Äî :\\"It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God, and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another.\\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 345. :\\"God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! That is the great secret. If the veil were rent today, and ... God ... (were) to make himself visible ... if you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form ‚Äî like yourselves in all the person, image, and the very form as a man.\\" * Humanity‚Äôs potential to become Gods themselves. ‚Äî :Smith discussed the potential of mankind by referencing Romans 8:17, then stating that men may go: \\"...from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation ... until (they) arrive at the station of a God.\\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pp. 346-47. * the tie between the living and their progenitors ‚Äî :\\"Is there nothing to be done? ‚Äî no preparation ‚Äî no salvation for our fathers and friends who have died without having had the opportunity to obey the decrees of the Son of Man?\\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 355. :\\"God hath made a provision that every spirit in the eternal world can be ... saved unless he has committed (the) unpardonable sin.\\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 357. Regarding his personal religious experiences, Smith stated: \\"I don't blame anyone for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I could not have believed it myself.\\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 361. Concerned with difficulties facing the church and threats on his own life, he closed the two-hour-and-fifteen-minute address with a plea for peace and invoked God's blessing on the assembled Latter Day Saints. Although the discourse is considered by Mormons to be one of the most important given by Smith on the nature of God and exaltation, it is not part of the LDS Church's canonized scriptures. The topics in the discourse were not new to Smith's preaching.See notes at: W. V. Smith, \\"A parallel account of known texts of the King Follett Discourse,\\" The Parallel Joseph, The Book of Abraham Project, boap.org Nearly all the subjects treated were continuing threads from earlier sermons.

It was released for the PlayStation on September 29, 1999 and was later ported to the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, Dreamcast, and N-Gage. The N64 port was the final game released for the console in PAL territories. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater takes place in a 3-D environment permeated by an ambience of punk rock and ska music. The player takes control of a variety of famous skateboarders and must complete missions by performing skateboarding tricks and collecting objects. The game offers several modes of gameplay, including a career mode in which the player must complete objectives and evolve their character's attributes, a free-play mode in which the player may skate without any given objective, and a multi-player mode that features a number of competitive games. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was met with critical acclaim for all versions but the Game Boy Color version, which had a more mixed reception. The game resulted in a successful franchise, receiving eight annualized sequels developed by Neversoft from 2000's Pro Skater 2 to 2007's Proving Ground. Gameplay Tony Hawk's Pro Skater puts the player in control of a famous skateboarder and takes place in a third-person view with a fixed camera. The goal of the game is to perform tricks and combinations thereof in an effort to increase the player's score. Movement can be altered using the d-pad, and ollies, grabs, flips and slides are each assigned to individual buttons. Each skateboarder has eight grabs, eight slides and eight flips. The number of points earned from a successful trick sequence is dependent on the amount of time spent in the air, the degree of rotation, and the number and variety of tricks performed; the more a single trick is performed in a sequence, the fewer points it will earn. When the player succeeds in performing tricks, a special gauge increases. When this gauge is full and flashing, the player is capable of performing a special trick that is worth many more points than ordinary tricks. If the player bails (falls off their skateboard), any points that may have been earned from the current combo are lost, and the special gauge is emptied. The player, as Tony Hawk, has gathered all the letters of the word \\"SKATE\\". The screenshot is taken from the Dreamcast version. In the game's \\"Career Mode\\", the player must complete five objectives (represented by videotapes) in each level within a period of two minutes. The player is not obligated to complete all the objectives within a single run; any completed objective is committed to the game's memory, which allows other objectives to be completed within multiple playthroughs of a level. Two common objectives in each level are achieved by accumulating two defined scores, while one other common objective is to collect letters of the word \\"SKATE\\", and another common objective is to destroy five of a certain object within each level. The fifth objective is more varied, but is often oriented around a specific element found in each level. Completing objectives unlocks additional levels and equipment for use. Three of the mode's levels take place in a competition in which the player performs for judges and accumulates the highest score within three one-minute rounds. The player receives a bronze, silver or gold medal depending on the final score they are given. Other single-player modes include the \\"Single Session\\", in which the player can freely accumulate a high score within two minutes using any previously-obtained levels and characters, and the \\"Free Skate\\", in which there is no time limit imposed. The multiplayer mode is played by two players in a split screen view and offers three games: \\"Graffiti\\", \\"Trick Attack\\", and \\"HORSE\\". In \\"Graffiti\\", players must accumulate the highest score by changing level elements into their own color via the use of tricks. If a player performs a higher-scoring trick on an element that has already been marked, the element will change to that player's color. \\"Trick Attack\\" is a mode in which players must accumulate the highest score by chaining tricks together. \\"HORSE\\" is a game that is played intermittently between two players, who must compete in rounds lasting either eight seconds or until a trick has been made. The player with the lower score on any given turn receives a letter in the word \\"HORSE\\" or whatever word the players had generated prior to the game's start. The first player to accumulate the entire word loses. Development Following the releases of Sega's Top Skater and Electronic Arts' Street Sk8er, Activision identified skateboarding-simulation games as a growing market in the gaming industry and concluded that such a title would resonate with a young audience. Preceding Neversoft's involvement in the project, the task of developing a skateboarding title for Activision was given to another studio. This studio's attempt did not impress Activision and didn't move past the concept stage. The publisher then decided to entrust the project to Neversoft, which had recently completed the third-person shooter game Apocalypse within nine months. Although Neversoft had never developed a sports video game before, the development team was confident in its ability to accomplish the task before its given deadline of the 1999 Christmas season. During development, the Neversoft team would spend its lunch breaks at a bowling alley near the studio, where they would play and study from Sega's Top Skater in the arcade. The game's design served as a strong basic influence, along with observances of real skaters performing in the X Games. Although the team decided that Top Skaters linearity lacked the sense of fun they aimed for, the \\"racetrack\\" element was retained in two of the game's levels. Contrary to subsequent titles in the series, Neversoft did not use existing locations as reference for the game's level design, but simply envisioned potential skating areas such as a school or a city and incorporated elements such as ramps and rails to benefit the gameplay. The team consciously prioritized fun over realism in the approach to the game's level design and physics. Tony Hawk, the game's namesake, in 2006 The game's engine is a modified version of that of Neversoft's previous title Apocalypse, and the game's prototype used Bruce Willis's character from that game as the player character. Once the prototype reached a functional and demonstrable state, the Neversoft team realized that they would require a professional skateboarder to aid in the remainder of production. At the time, Tony Hawk had been a popular figure within skateboarding. In September 1998, Activision established contact with Hawk and arranged a meeting between him and Neversoft. Hawk was impressed by the design team members' devotion to skateboarding, the controls and engine of their game's early build and thus agreed to lend his name and involvement to the production. Subsequently, Hawk would turn down Activision's offer of a one-time buyout for the permanent use of his name and likeness on the game in favor of a royalty deal in which Hawk would earn a percentage for every copy sold. As a result of the series' eventual success, Hawk would earn ten times Activision's initial offer within two years. On January 14, 1999, Activision publicly announced their agreement with Hawk to include him in the game. Activision senior vice president Mitch Lasky, in an interview with GameSpot, stated that the character was meant \\"to reflect Tony's signature style ‚Äì an intense mix of acrobatics and hard-core technical skating\\". Hawk remarked that \\"[he had] always wanted to help create a video game that represented the reality and excitement of professional skateboarding\\". Hawk would spend the development time periodically playing through the game's builds and providing feedback. He would also select a group of other professional skaters to include as playable characters based on their skills, personalities and diversity; each skater received a cut of the royalties and got to select their own attire and special trick for the game. In animating the skaters, the design team largely depended on using video footage as reference. The incorporation of motion capture was attempted to aid in the realism of the animation, but due to the technology's infancy, the result was ultimately determined to have not translated as well as what had already been animated. The 900 featured in the game was itself drawn from footage of Hawk's famed performance of the feat in the X Games that summer, and was a relatively late addition as a result. The collection of videotapes was directly inspired by the collection of stars in Super Mario 64. In designing the objectives, the team would gather at a table, draw a level and then ask what could be done within said level, upon which the team members would provide ideas. Rejected concepts arising from these sessions include levels taking place on a highway and a jetty, and a scenario in which the player would lose a wheel and have to skate on three wheels. Manuals were intended to be implemented into the game, but were omitted due to time constraints; manuals would subsequently be included in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. =Promotion and release= On August 26, 1999, Elissa Steamer's inclusion in the game, along with the game's final release date of September 29, was announced. A playable demonstration with only two available skaters was integrated into the Jampack Summer '99 compilation CD released by PlayStation Underground. The game was made available for pre-order for the two weeks prior to the game's release; those who pre-ordered the game at Electronics Boutique or Funcoland respectively received a miniature replica of Tony Hawk's Birdhouse skateboard, a sticker sheet featuring the game's ten professional skaters and a game tip on the back of each sticker. A second playable demonstration was included on a promotional compilation disc released by Pizza Hut on November 14, 1999. Because Neversoft would begin development of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 shortly before the release of the first game, Activision would entrust the game's Nintendo 64 port to Edge of Reality, which had recently ported Monster Truck Madness 2 to the same system. The Nintendo 64 port was announced on August 18, 1999 with an expected release date of March 2000 announced on February. The Nintendo 64 version, as well as the Game Boy Color version, received an intense multi-million dollar advertising campaign on several major youth-targeted channels in the United States for the first two weeks of April 2000. Customers who purchased the Game Boy Color version at Toys \\"R\\" Us or Funcoland received a special-edition miniature skateboard. As a result of the disappointing sales of Blue Stinger, Activision was discouraged from publishing further titles for the Dreamcast and relinquished the distribution of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on the console to Crave Entertainment. Following online speculation and teasing comments from company insiders, a port for the Dreamcast developed by Treyarch was officially announced on December 14, 1999 for a release in the second quarter of 2000. The N-Gage version was slated for an October 2003 release on May 16, 2003. The game came bundled with the N-Gage QD that was released in 2004. Ports The Nintendo 64 port of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was developed by Edge of Reality and released on March 15, 2000. While the port is largely faithful to the original version and retains all game modes, characters and levels, the soundtrack had been truncated and the voices were removed to accommodate the lessened space in the cartridge format. The blood effects had also been removed. The Dreamcast version was developed by Treyarch, published by Crave Entertainment and released on May 24, 2000. The graphics and animations in the Dreamcast version are improved from those in the PlayStation version. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on Game Boy Color The Game Boy Color version was developed by Natsume and released on March 30, 2000. The Game Boy Color version is an adaptation rather than a true port of the PlayStation version due to the limited capacity of the platform. The game offers two different gameplay styles: an overhead view with vertical scrolling, and a side-scrolling view in which there is a ramp on each side. There are four gameplay modes in which the player can only perform a few tricks. In \\"Half Pipe Mode\\", the player must attempt to achieve the highest score possible. \\"Tournament Mode\\" is a five-level vertically scrolling game in which the player must race against three computer-controlled skaters and achieve the highest rank. Jumps are made automatically when the player maneuvers onto ramps, and tricks are displayed as a brief static image. \\"Versus Mode\\" and \\"Rival Mode\\" are identical to \\"Tournament Mode\\", except the player plays in a single level against a single opponent; the opponent in \\"Rival Mode\\" is computer-controlled, while the opponent in \\"Versus Mode\\" is human, which necessitates the use of a Game Link Cable. The N-Gage version was developed by Ideaworks3D and released on October 13, 2003, a week following the launch of the N-Gage. The game is a faithful port of the PlayStation version and retains most of the characters, levels, control scheme and original music while adding levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and two multiplayer games. The game's multiplayer functions via the N-Gage's Bluetooth feature. A remaster of both the first game and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, was developed by Vicarious Visions and released on September 4, 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One systems. The remaster includes all of the original levels and skaters from the original games, but also includes improved skater creation and park creation modes, online multiplayer, and other new features, and featuring most of the original soundtracks, with a few exceptions due to licensing issues. Reception Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was met with critical acclaim. Doug Perry of IGN praised the game's \\"imaginative, deep, and amazingly addictive\\" gameplay, \\"steady and consistent\\" learning curve, \\"intuitive and natural\\" controls, large and complex levels, \\"jaw-dropping\\" physics and \\"perfect\\" soundtrack. Perry concluded that the game had \\"captured the pure grit and radical feel of skateboarding, delivering it in near perfect form onto the PlayStation with a mastery and sense of programming finesse beyond anyone's imagination\\", and described the game as \\"that rare gem of a game that defies what other developers say can't be done.\\" Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot commended the game's graphics, frame rate, camera and sound effects, and declared the game to be \\"a worthy addition to anyone's PlayStation collection\\", though he was not personally fond of the soundtrack and wished that there was more variety in the game's tricks. He additionally noted that the Dreamcast version used the console's hardware to its advantage by displaying clearer textures and a smoother framerate \\"that may very well cause longtime fans of the game to weep\\". Chris Carle of IGN also praised the Dreamcast version's improved textures. Matt Casamassina of IGN praised the Nintendo 64 version's visuals as \\"very impressive\\" in spite of the reduced quality of the textures and the omitted full-motion video effects, and the audio as \\"surprisingly clear\\", albeit compressed and \\"dumbed down\\" to accommodate the cartridge format. Martin Taylor of Eurogamer cited the game's graphics as \\"crisp, smooth and very, very hard to fault\\", but noted that the game's soundtrack suffered from the compression process and that the looping music \\"quickly becomes incredibly annoying\\"; the latter sentiment was mirrored by Dr. Moo of Game Revolution. In reviewing the Game Boy Color version, Craig Harris of IGN decided that while the half-pipe portion of the game \\"isn't half-bad\\", the overhead portion is \\"absolutely stupid\\"; he criticized the representation of tricks as static images as \\"completely destroy[ing] the flow of the game\\", and noted that the issue is exacerbated in the \\"Versus\\" mode by having both parties' game pause when either one performs a trick. Frank Provo of GameSpot cited the game's lack of level variety and \\"borderline mediocre\\" audio, but felt that it was the best skateboarding title to be made for a portable console. Both Chadd Chambers of IGN and Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot considered the N-Gage version to be the best game available on the system and were relatively impressed by the game's graphics, but noted the less comfortable control scheme and reduced sound quality. Blake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"Whether you're a hardcore skater or just a wannabe, this will satisfy. A must-have for anyone with a PlayStation.\\" Eric Bratcher reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"A great translation that takes a mild performance hit from the N64 controller. Still, every N64 owner should consider buying this one-of-a-kind title.\\" Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"Hawk soars. End of story.\\" Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was ranked #36 in Game Informers \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\" in its 100th issue on August 2001. The game was nominated for \\"Console Game of the Year\\" and \\"Console Sports Game of the Year\\" in the 2000 D.I.C.E. Awards, but lost to Soulcalibur and Knockout Kings 2000 respectively. The soundtrack has been noted as an influence on millennials. =Sales= Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was the third highest-selling PlayStation title of November 1999 in the United States. From its release date to late- December 1999, the game shipped in excess of 350,000 units and was available in over 10,000 retailers nationwide. The PlayStation version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The PlayStation versions of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and its successor were respectively the third and second highest- selling console games of 2000. The Nintendo 64 version was the sixth highest- selling Nintendo 64 title in the United States during the week of November 19‚Äì26, 2000.

It is a member of the prestigious 985 and 211 group of universities and a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University. It was founded in 1919, by educators Yan Xiu and Zhang Boling. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945), Nankai University, Peking University and Tsinghua University merged and formed the National Changsha Provisional University, which later moved to Kunming and was renamed the National Southwestern Associated University (Ë•øÂçóËÅîÂ§ß). It was described as The North Star of Higher Learning. On 25 December 2000, the State Ministry of Education signed an agreement with Tianjin Municipal Government to jointly establish and develop Nankai University. Since then, Nankai has been listed among the universities to receive priority development investments from the Chinese government in the twenty-first century. Nankai has long been recognized as one of the most prestigious universities in China,Nankai University profile, GoToUniversity (retrieved 28 September 2020) constantly ranked among various top 10 lists of Chinese Universities. As a comprehensive university with a wide range of disciplines, Nankai features a balance between the humanities and the sciences, a solid foundation and a combination of application and creativity. The university has 26 academic colleges, together with the Graduate School, the School for Continuing Education, the Advanced Vocational School, the Modern Distance Education School, and categories covering literature, history, philosophy, economics, management, law, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, teaching and art. The university is especially well known for its economics, history, chemistry, and mathematics research and study. Nankai's alumni include the first Premier of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai, mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern and Nobel laureates Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee.  History  Students of Nankai University in 1919Main Building of Nankai University = 1919‚Äì1937 = The university was founded as a private institution in 1919. Nankai's scale was relatively small at its inception partly because it received no funding from the government but instead was funded by foreign charitable funds and local entrepreneurs, with only 3 departments (liberal arts, science, and business) and 96 students. It was noted particularly for its courses which were taught in English using foreign curricula and textbooks. The well-known Nankai Institute of Economics was established in 1927 and soon became one of the most prominent in China being the first non-foreign entity to calculate a Chinese Consumer Price Index.http://www.nankai.edu.cn/english/ By 1937, Nankai had expanded into a university of 3 colleges, 13 departments, and 2 research institutes, with 429 students and 110 faculty and staff members. It was compared to be \\"The North Star of Higher Learning\\". = 1937‚Äì1949 = In July 1937, during the Sino-Japanese War, Nankai campus was severely damaged by Japanese bombings. About two-thirds of the school buildings were destroyed including its library which was deliberately burnt down by the Japanese Imperial Army. A number of the school's artifacts, including the university bell, were looted and remain in Japanese museums till this day. In August 1937, still during the Sino-Japanese War, Nankai University, Peking University and Tsinghua University united together and formed the National Changsha Provisional University, which later moved to Kunming and was renamed the National Southwestern Associated University. In 1946, after the war, Nankai returned to Tianjin and was reformed into a national university by the government. At that time, Nankai had four schools (Liberal Arts, Science, Political Science and Economics, and Engineering) and 16 departments. = 1949‚Äì1966 = After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Nankai was readjusted and became a comprehensive university with emphasis on the arts and sciences, with 14 departments and 3 professional specialties in total. = 1966‚Äì1976 = From 1966 to 1976 the School's normal life was out of order due to the Cultural Revolution. In 1976 a catastrophic earthquake broke out in Tangshan, bordering Tianjin, causing damage of varying degrees to the School's buildings. = 1976‚Äìpresent = 200px After 1980, Nankai added a number of new specialities and institutes. In Arts, applied specialities on financing were set up and the School of Economics was reopened in 1983, while in Sciences, interdisciplinary, marginal and high and new technological specialities were added. Nankai was amongst the first universities in China to open its doors for students from America in the 1980s. In 1989 the university was ordered by the Tianjin public security bureau to send two Americans back home, following rising political tensions over pro-democracy demonstrations. By the late 1980s, Nankai University had grown to be a comprehensive university embracing Humanities, Natural Sciences, Applied Sciences, Life Sciences, Managements and Art. In 1994 Tianjin Foreign Trade College was merged to Nankai university. In 1999 under the combined efforts of Nankai and TEDA, TEDA College was set up. In 2000 the State Ministry of Education signed an agreement with Tianjin Municipal Government on jointly establishing and developing Nankai University. Experimental cooperation between Nankai University and Tianjin University was initiated on the principle of independent school-running and close cooperation. In 2002 under the cooperative efforts of Nankai, Government of Shenzhen and UC Berkeley, the Financial Engineering College was established in Shenzhen. In May 2006 Nankai's president Rao Zihe tendered 15 of the 21 university's college dean positions, restaffing key positions in an effort to further improve the university's educational programs. In February 2015, following Chinese media reports and statements from inside the Chinese Communist Party that universities would have to \\"be cleansed of liberal Western textbooks and other ideological heresies\\" , Nankai's president Gong Ke publicly stated: \\"Recently I've read people on the Internet saying that the ranks of academics must be cleansed, purified and rectified. I can't agree with this. This was the mentality of 1957 or 1966.\\" and \\"We cannot re-enact this history of \\"leftist\\" errors against intellectuals.\\"  Campus  Nankai university encompasses three campuses. Balitai, Jinnan and TEDA. The total local campus area is 456.1 and the building area 136.8 hectare. = Balitai campus = Balitai was the first campus to be established in 1919 and is located at Balitai in the Nankai district of Taijin. The campus hosts 10 colleges, namely the Business School, School of Economics, School of Literature, College of Chemistry, School of Mathematical Sciences, Institute of Physics, College of Foreign Languages, College of Life Sciences and Institute of Japan Studies. = Jinnan campus = Jinnan campus is the latest campus of Nankai university. It was opened in September 2015 and is located in the jinnan Area. The campus hosts 14 colleges, the Zhou Enlai School of Government, College of Tourism and Service Management, School of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Law School, College of Chinese Language and Culture, Faculty of Philosophy, College of History, College of Computer and Control Engineering, College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, School of Material Science and Engineering, School of Finance and College of Software. = TEDA Campus = TEDA campus is also located in the Binhau New Area and hosts the TEDA Institute of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology and the TEDA Institute of Applied Physics.  Academics  The Eastern Arts Building Nankai is a multidisciplinary university under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. = Teaching and Learning = The university has academic programs that cover the humanities, natural sciences, technology, life sciences, medical sciences and the arts, with an equal balance between the sciences and the liberal arts. Nankai's academic programs operate on a semester calendar, with two terms. The first beginning in early September and ending in early January and the second beginning in early February and ending in early July. Subsequently, winter break usually ranges from early January to early February and summer break from early July to early September. Nankai, in 2013, had 22 colleges and schools, and offered 79 bachelor's degree programs, 231 master's degree programs, and 172 PhD programs. The total enrollment stood at approximately 12,000 undergraduate students and 11,000 graduate students. Of the total student population, 10% were international students from different countries around the world.

Established in 1893, it is the oldest provincial park in Canada. Additions since its creation have increased the park to its current size of about 7,653 square kilometres (2,955 sq mi). The park is contiguous with several smaller, administratively separate provincial parks that protect important rivers in the area, resulting in a larger total protected area. Its size, combined with its proximity to the major urban centres of Toronto and Ottawa, makes Algonquin one of the most popular provincial parks in the province and the country. Highway 60 runs through the south end of the park, while the Trans-Canada Highway bypasses it to the north. Over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers are located within the park. Some notable examples include Canoe Lake and the Petawawa, Nipissing, Amable du Fond, Madawaska, and Tim rivers. These were formed by the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age. The park is considered part of the \\"border\\" between Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The park is in an area of transition between northern coniferous forest and southern deciduous forest. This unique mixture of forest types, and the wide variety of environments in the park, allows the park to support an uncommon diversity of plant and animal species. It is also an important site for wildlife research. Algonquin Park was named a National Historic Site of Canada in 1992 in recognition of several heritage values including: its role in the development of park management; pioneering visitor interpretation programs later adopted by national and provincial parks across the country; its role in inspiring artists, which in turn gave Canadians a greater sense of their country; and historic structures such as lodges, hotels, cottages, camps, entrance gates (the West Gate was designed by George H. Williams, Chief Architect and Deputy Minister of Public Works for the Province of Ontario), a railway station, and administration and museum buildings. Algonquin Park is the only designated park within the province of Ontario to allow industrial logging to take place within its borders. History =Early logging= In the 19th century, the logging industry cut the large white pine and red pine trees to produce lumber for domestic and American markets, as well as square timber for export to Great Britain. The loggers were followed by small numbers of homesteaders and farmers. Even at that time, however, the area's beauty was recognized by nature preservationists. To manage these conflicting interests, the Ontario Government appointed a commission to inquire into and report on the matter. The act to establish Algonquin Park was drawn up in 1892 by this five member Royal Commission, made up of Alexander Kirkwood (the chairman and Commissioner of Crown Lands), James Dickson (Ontario Land Surveyor), Archibald Blue (director of mines), Robert Phipps (head of the Forestry Branch), and Aubrey White (Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands). Their report recommended the establishment of a park in the territory lying near and enclosing the headwaters of five major rivers, those being: the Muskoka, Little Madawaska River (including Opeongo), Amable du Fond River, Petawawa River, and South rivers. The commissioners remarked in their report: \\"the experience of older countries had everywhere shown that the wholesale and indiscriminate slaughter of forests brings a host of evils in its train. Wide tracts are converted from fertile plains into arid desert, springs and streams are dried up, and the rainfall, instead of percolating gently through the forest floor and finding its way by easy stages by brook and river to the lower levels, now descends the valley in hurrying torrents, carrying before it tempestuous floods.\\" *Report of the (Ontario) Royal Commission on Forest Conservation and National Park, Mar. 8, 1893 Although much of the area within Algonquin had been under license for some time, it was intended to make the park an example of good forestry practices. Only licenses to cut pine would be issued. The commissioners had recommended that when the hardwood was mature, it too should be cut. Dark Day fire Researchers believe that smoke from a forest fire in Algonquin Park was responsible for New England's Dark Day of May 19, 1780.Fire scars reveal source of New England's 1780 Dark Day. Retrieved from http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WF05095.htm. This is based on investigations into scar marks which are left in the growth rings of trees that survive forest fires. Data obtained from such scar marks make it possible to approximate the date of a past fire. =Current logging= 1893 Survey of Park Lands Industrial logging continues in significant portions of the park's interior. After 2013 amendments to the park management plan, 65.3% of the park (498,785 hectares) remains in the recreation/utilization zone where logging is permitted. Numerous methods of logging take place throughout the park including clear cutting, selection cutting and shelterwood cutting. , the Algonquin Forestry Authority is currently reviewing an application that would allow for expansion of current logging roads and the addition of new ones. Forestry activities in Algonquin, including logging are carried out in accordance with a Forest Management Plan prepared according to Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry requirements. The planning process includes public consultation opportunities at several stages of preparation. The 2010‚Äì2020 approved Forest Management Plan for the Algonquin Park Forest, the 2015‚Äì2020 Phase 2 Plan, and the associated Annual Work Schedules and Reports are available on the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's website. =Park formation= An Act to establish \\"Algonquin National Park of Ontario\\" was passed by the Liberal government of Oliver Mowat in the Ontario Legislature, May 23, 1893 (56 Vic., c.8). The name \\"Algonquin\\" refers to the Algonquin people, indigenous inhabitants of the area. Although called a \\"national park\\", Algonquin has always been under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. No provincial parks existed until Algonquin, but there was a new movement to create national parks since Banff's establishment in 1885. The name was changed to Algonquin Provincial Park in 1913. *Notice regarding establishment of ‚ÄòThe Algonquin National Park of Ontario‚Äô, Sept. 27, 1893, transcribed on Death On a Painted Lake: The Death of Tom Thomson *Archibald M. Campbell, \\"The Algonquin National Park of Ontario-Its Resources and Advantages,\\" The Ottawa Naturalist XV (June, 1901): 80-89, transcribed on Death On a Painted Lake: The Death of Tom Thomson Autumn scene in Algonquin Park The boundaries of the park included 18 townships within the District of Nipissing, covering an area of of which 10% was under water. The tract of land was to be set apart, as a public park, health resort and pleasure ground for the benefit, advantage and enjoyment of all the people of the province. The year following the park's creation saw portions of six new townships added to the existing park's boundaries (Paxton, McCroney, Finlayson, Butt, Ballantyne, and Boyd). The first four were put up for auction that same year. The production of the lumber companies operating in the park at the time increased from 680,000 m3 (288 million board feet) in 1886 to 809,000 m3 (343 million board feet) in 1896. Peter Thomson, the first chief ranger of Algonquin Park, was responsible for establishing park boundaries, constructing buildings, and posting notices to warn hunters and trappers against trespassing. He liaised with timber operators, oversaw the removal of settlers and their homes, and notified local Algonquin natives that they could no longer hunt or trap in the area. Park rangers began patrolling the park, the game protected, and forest fires were suppressed. By 1910 wildlife numbers were increasing. Thousands of people had visited the great pleasure resort and it was said to be undeniably one of the most beautiful natural parks in the Dominion, if not on this continent.\\" All this had entailed a large expenditure by the government, which was recovered chiefly through the maintenance of timber licenses. There was no fee for camping permits, though a nominal charge was introduced for fishing and guides' licenses when \\"an Act to establish the Algonquin National Park of Ontario\\" was again passed by the legislature, March 19, 1910. This new legislation included the original area as well as portions of ten townships annexed into the park since 1893, and allowed for further expansion by the addition of adjacent townships, should it become necessary. Another notable figure in park management was Frank MacDougall, the park's chief ranger from 1931 to 1941. He was the first ranger to supervise the park by airplane, flying a Fairchild KR-34. He eventually became deputy minister for the provincial Ministry of Lands and Forests, and the portion of Highway 60 which passes through Algonquin Park has been named the Frank A. MacDougall Parkway in his honour.\\"The Flying Superintendent‚Äôs Fairchild\\". The Country Connection, Winter/Spring 1999. =Railway, settlement, and the beginning of tourism= Map of CN Railways lines in the park from 1922 A hand-coloured photograph of canoeists in Algonquin Park in the 1920s Tom Thomson, In Algonquin Park, Winter 1914-15. McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg Construction of the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (O. A. & P. S.) through the park in 1896 provided the first easy access to the area. While the park's purpose was to control settlement within its boundaries, the families of railway workers as well as those of the lumbermen took up residence in the park. The village of Mowat on the west side of Canoe Lake was first established in 1893 as a logging camp for the Gilmour Lumber Company. From there, logs were driven down the Oxtongue River towards Lake of Bays and eventually on to Trenton. In the same year the park headquarters was established near the logging camp. The arrival of the railway had provided easy access for the lumbermen as well. The Gilmour firm decided to put up a sawmill closer to their source of timber. By 1897 the village of Mowat had grown to 500 residents and there were 18 km of railway siding. The same year saw the official opening of the railway between Ottawa and Depot Harbour. Park headquarters were also relocated in 1897 from Mowat to a point of land on the north shore of Cache Lake, adjacent to the railway. The O. A. & P. S. put up a station there it named Algonquin Park. The railway, taken over by the Canada Atlantic Railway in 1899, was in turn sold to the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1905. In 1898 George W. Bartlett was appointed as the second superintendent of Algonquin Park, replacing the late Peter Thompson. Placed under the direction of the Premier of Ontario to make the park self-sufficient, Bartlett worked to make the park more attractive to tourists by encouraging short-term leases for cottages, lodges, and camps. Changes came about in 1908, when Hotel Algonquin was opened at Joe Lake. The Grand Trunk Railway opened its first hotel, the Highland Inn, near Park Headquarters. Built on a hill behind Algonquin Park station, the two-storey year-round resort was an immediate success. Soon other guest lodges were established in the park. To the west side of Highland Inn, land was cleared and raised wooden platforms erected, on which tents (supplied by the hotel), were put up to meet the requirements of the rapidly growing tourist trade. At the village of Mowat, abandoned by Gilmour Lumber Co. in 1900, the mill's former boarding house became Mowat Lodge in 1913. The Highland Inn was enlarged, and new camps were built. Nominigan Camp, consisting of a main lodge with six cabins of log construction, was established on Smoke Lake. Camp Minnesing on Burnt Island Lake was created as a wilderness lodge. Both, open only in July and August, were built by the GTR as affiliates of the Highland Inn. A second railway, the Canadian Northern (CNoR), was built across the northern portion of the park, opening in 1915. Both lines later became part of Canadian National Railway. The beginning of the end of rail service in the park happened in 1933 when a flood damaged an old Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway trestle on Cache Lake. The trestle was deemed too dangerous to use and too expensive to fix, ending through service on the southern line (old O.A. & P.S.). Service from the west ended in 1952, and from the east in 1959. Service on the old CNoR line through the north end of the park ended in 1995. Many of the trails in the park still make use of portions of the old railway rights-of-way. =Administration and management= As recreational use of the park increased during the 1950s and 1960s, it became clear that a long-term plan to manage the park was required. Six years of consultation with park users resulted in the 1974 publication of the Algonquin Master Plan, a management plan that sought to ensure that the park could continue indefinitely to serve all of the competing park interests. Three major changes came about as a result of the plan. One, the park was divided into zones with different specified purposes and uses: Nature Reserve and Historic (5.7% of land area), Wilderness (12%), Development (4.3%) and Recreation-Utilization (78%) zones. Logging in the park was limited to the Recreation-Utilization zones, but was separated as much as possible from users of the park interior in order to maintain the park's natural environment. Each year only a small percentage of the park is being actively logged. Two, all existing timber licenses were cancelled, and all logging in the park is now done by the Algonquin Forestry Authority, which supplies timber to 10 private mills outside the park. Three, rules were put in place to limit the impact of recreational use of the park. Almost all cans and bottles are banned in the interior, and limits are placed on the number of people per campsite, and the number of people who can enter the park interior per day at each access point. Also, the use of boat motors is limited, both in power and to a few of the larger and more accessible lakes. The master plan has been reviewed and updated four times since 1974, with the latest version being published in 1998. Climate The park has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Climate Classification Dfb) with long, cold, snowy winters and warm summers. In winter, temperatures frequently drop below while in summer, temperatures can exceed 9 days per year. Precipitation averages per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with late summer/early fall being the wettest months and the winter months being the driest. Legacy of landscapes As a result of its beauty, Algonquin Park became recognized by nature preservationists. It quickly became popular with anglers, though hunting was prohibited. The landscapes of Algonquin Park attracted artists such as Tom Thomson along with members of the Group of Seven. Thomson served as a guide in the park, often working from Mowat Lodge. He did much of his painting at Canoe Lake, and a favourite campsite of his was behind Hayhurst Point, a peninsula overlooking the central portion of the lake. Many of Thomson's most significant paintings are of Algonquin Park, including The Jack Pine and The West Wind. He died under mysterious circumstances at Canoe Lake in 1917. A plaque recognizing his national historic significance stands at the Visitor Centre dock on Canoe Lake, erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Friends of the painter erected a cairn and totem pole memorial on Hayhurst Point, near the north end of the lake. Visitor activities Entrance to Alqonquin Park The Algonquin Visitor Centre at km 43 of the Highway 60 corridor Algonquin is popular for year-round outdoor activities. There are over 1,200 campsites in eight designated campgrounds along Highway 60 in the south end of the park, with almost 100 others in three other campgrounds across the northern and eastern edges. There is also the Whitefish Lake group campground with 18 sites of various sizes to accommodate groups of 20, 30, or 40 people. Interior Camping is possible further inside the park at sites accessible only by canoe or on foot. Docked canoe on Pog Lake, Algonquin Park. The Algonquin Visitor Centre features exhibits about the natural and cultural history of the park. A large and detailed relief map of southern Ontario is displayed to enable a visitor to be oriented to the size and geography of the park. In a flow-through style, exhibits continue with many taxidermied species set in their native surroundings, then progresses, in a chronological manner, through an extensive collection of artifacts relating to human intervention in the park. The centre also includes a video theatre, a gift shop, a panoramic outdoor viewing deck, and an art gallery‚Äî\\"The Algonquin Room\\"‚Äîwith changing exhibits of art related to the park. Lookout trail Other activities include fishing, mountain biking, horseback riding, cross country skiing, and day hiking. The park has 19 interpretive trails, ranging in length from . Each trail comes with a trail guide and is meant to introduce visitors to a different aspect of the park's ecology or history. Algonquin is home to a Natural Heritage Education program. The most popular aspect of the program are the weekly wolf howls. These are held (weather and wolves permitting) on Thursdays in the month of August, and sometimes in the first week of September if there is a Thursday before Labour Day. Park staff attempt to locate a wolf pack on Wednesday evening and, if successful, they announce a public wolf howl the next day. The park also publishes a visitor's newsletter, The Raven, six times a year ‚Äì two issues in spring, two in summer, one in the fall, and one in the winter. =Algonquin Logging Museum= Opened in 1992, the Algonquin Logging Museum is located by the park's east gate. A trail features a recreated logging camp, a steam-powered amphibious tug called an \\"alligator\\", logging equipment and interpretive panels about logging industry activities in the park. Exhibits include a video presentation. The museum is open seasonally. One annual feature worthy of note at the museum is \\"Logger's Day\\", typically held in late July or early August each year. This festivity includes musicians, a logger's old style lunch, activities for children, interpretive actors, and forest industry representatives. =Canoe routes= Canoe camping is one of the most popular activities. This wilderness experience, essentially, a pristine wilderness canoe journey through vastness of the park, allows the tourist to enjoy the interior of Algonquin Park in ways inaccessible by any other means. The \\"Friends of Algonquin Park\\" organization publishes an authoritative map and guide called Canoe Routes of Algonquin Park.Canoe Routes of Algonquin Park. =Aspects of interior camping= Although there are numerous drive-in campgrounds in Algonquin, the park is better known for its interior camping; that is, campsites which are only accessible by canoe or hiking in the summer, or ski or snowshoe in the winter. Algonquin Park provides some of Canada's best canoeing, with hundreds of navigable lakes and rivers forming a interconnected system of canoe routes. The two main access points to start a trip are located on Canoe Lake and Lake Opeongo. The further a camper proceeds from these access points, the more wild the park becomes, and it is possible to spend several days in the interior with few or no sightings of other campers. Park staff maintain portages between all major and even smaller lakes, and interior campsite reservations can be made through the main Ontario Parks reservation system. There are also three areas of back-country hiking trails, with sub-loops ranging from long. These hiking trails have their own dedicated campsites, typically located on the shores of small lakes. Although some lakes have sites for both canoe and hiking access, the sites are designated by type of use. Interior camping can provide excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. The eerie call of the common loon can be heard from every campground and loons can be seen on almost every lake. Moose, deer and beaver can often be seen, especially along waterways, given sufficiently quiet campers. Otters are also present, but less frequently seen. Black bears, although present in the park, are seldom seen, especially if appropriate precautions to avoid attracting them are taken. Wolves may be heard, but will likely remain distant from campers. =Fishing= Female moose on the Amable du Fond River in Algonquin Fishing is allowed in the park for holders of valid Ontario fishing licences, with the purchase of a daily or seasonal vehicle permit as well available through the Ministry of Natural Resources. Fish such as bass, yellow perch, trout and pike can be found in the waterways of the park. The further an angler is willing to travel from an access point, the better the fishing. The backcountry lakes do not receive heavy fishing pressure. Services The non-profit Friends of Algonquin Park operate a tourist information station, CFOA-FM.CRTC archives, Decision 94-306. A direct bus shuttle from Toronto is being run by Parkbus,Parkbus. a non- profit initiative, which is supported by the park. Research Algonquin Park has been an important arena for research since the 1930s. Four research facilities exist: Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research, Wildlife Research Station, Timber Research Station, and the visitor centre. Over 1800 scientific papers have been published on research done in the park, covering almost every aspect of the park: wildlife, geology, forestry, history, human impacts, etcetera. Also, the remote location and reasonably easy access from the National Research Council's Ottawa base of operations made the park a natural location for an eastern radio telescope, built in 1959 as the Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO). Although radio astronomy is not as active a field of research as it was in the 1950s and 60s, the ARO continues operation today. Summer camps Algonquin Park has been home to many historic summer camps including: *Algonquin Experience Camp, a now-defunct YMCA camp that was on the north shore of Whitefish Lake; *Camp Ahmek (boys) and Camp Wapomeo (girls) (The Taylor Statten Camps),The Taylor Statten Camps on Canoe Lake *Camp ArowhonCamp Arowhon (boys and girls) on Teepee Lake; *Camp Pathfinder (boys) on Source Lake; *Northway Lodge (girls) and its affiliate Camp Wendigo, a tripping outpost for boys, on Cache Lake; *Camp TamakwaCamp Tamakwa (boys and girls), on South Tea Lake; *Camp Tanamakoon (girls) on Tanamakoon Lake (linked to Cache Lake); Camps are members of the Ontario Camping Association. Geology and soils Algonquin is almost entirely underlain by the Precambrian-era metamorphic and igneous rock of the Canadian Shield. Quartz- feldspar gneiss and granite are among the most common types. More mafic rock such as hornblende-biotite gneiss and gabbro are occasionally found. The Brent Crater has Ordovician period sedimentary rock, chiefly limestone and sandstone. Glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch left a mantle of glacial till plus sandy and gravelly outwash deposits. Soils in the park are mostly coarse-textured and of poor quality, typical of the Canadian Shield. The hilly western side (which includes all of the Highway 60 Corridor) has a stony fine sandy loam glacial till which holds water better than the very coarse outwash soils which dominate the eastern side. The dominant soil classification on well drained forest soils is Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol. The most common soil series on till upland is Monteagle, while Wendigo dominates the outwash area. Classic podzol profile development with a well-defined eluvial (Ae) horizon is the rule; however, in some areas this horizon has been obliterated by disturbance such as earthworm activity. Concerns about effects of non-native earthworms on park soil ecosystems have not yet led to the banning of worm bait, but anglers are urged to dispose of unused worms in garbage containers. Gleysolic and organic soils are common where drainage is poor. Rivers The park contains and protects the headwaters of these rivers: *Amable du Fond River *Barron River *Bonnechere River *Gull River *Madawaska River *Magnetawan River *Muskoka River *Petawawa River *York River Flora and fauna Within the boundaries of the park, the following number of species are known to live: 53 species of mammals, 272 species of birds, 31 species of reptiles and amphibians, 54 species of fish, about 7000 species of insects, over 1000 species of plants, and over 1000 species of fungi.The Friends of Algonquin Park Web Site. Animals that inhabit Algonquin include moose, black bears, white-tailed deer, Canada jays, beavers, red foxes, great grey owls, and Eastern wolf.https://www.ontario.ca/page/algonquin-wolf Old growth sugar maple, hemlock and yellow birch forests are common in Algonquin Park. Researchers have aged trees in Algonquin's old-growth forests at up to 430 years old using ring counts, and up to 610 years old using estimation techniques. Some of Algonquin Park's old-growth forest occurs in the recreation-utilization zone and is available for logging.http://www.ancientforest.org/wp-content/uploads/rr32.pdf File:Cornus canadensis in Algonquin Park.jpgCanadian bunchberry (Cornus canadensis) File:Amanita flavoconia3.jpgMushroom in Algonquin Park File:Fungus4.jpgFungi in Algonquin Park File:Butterfly in Algonquin Park.jpgAmerican painted lady butterfly File:Cyanocitta-cristata-004.jpgBlue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) Famous deaths *Tom Thomson: Canoe Lake, July 1917 *Blair Frazer: Petawawa River (Rollway Rapids), May 1968 *Ken Danby: North Tea Lake, September 2007 See also *List of Ontario Parks References External links * *The Friends of Algonquin Park Web Site *Algonquin Forestry Authority (AFA) Web Site *Algonquin Map Web Site *Searching for the Sublime - A History of Algonquin Park *Wildlife Research Station *The British Library Sound Archive contains over 2000 wildlife sound recordings made in Algonquin Provincial Park. *Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research *Notice regarding establishment of ‚ÄòThe Algonquin National Park of Ontario‚Äô, Sept. 27, 1893, transcribed on Death On a Painted Lake: The Death of Tom Thomson * Report of the (Ontario) Royal Commission on Forest Conservation and National Park, Mar. 8, 1893, Transcribed on \\"Death On A Painted Lake: The Tom Thomson Tragedy\\". 2007.

He was voted the SABR \\"Centennial Celebrity\\" of 1983, as the best baseball player or figure born in 1883. However, the SABR Baseball Research Journal for 1983 acknowledges that there are discrepancies in records about Bender's birth year, ranging from 1883 to 1885. 1884 is the figure most often given. ‚Äì May 22, 1954) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball during the 1900s and 1910s. In 1911, Bender tied a record by pitching three complete games in a single World Series. He finished his career with a 212‚Äì127 win-loss record for a .625 winning percentage and a career 2.46 earned run average (ERA). After his major league playing career, Bender filled multiple baseball roles, including service as a major league coach, minor league manager and player- manager, college manager and professional scout. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953 and he died not long before his induction ceremony the following year. Early life Bender was born in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, as a member of the Ojibwe tribe. His father was German and his mother was part Chippewa. As a child, he was given the Ojibwe language name \\"Mandowescence\\", meaning \\"Little Spirit Animal\\". His family had on the White Earth Indian Reservation near Bemidji, Minnesota. His father taught him to farm on the reservation.Kashatus, pp. 5-6 He graduated from Carlisle Indian Industrial School and attended Dickinson College. Baseball career =Early career= Bender debuted in the major leagues in 1903. He is one of only a few pitchers in the 20th century to throw 200 or more innings at the age of 19. His walks per nine innings rate was 2.17; only a few pitchers since 1893 have had a rate below 2.2 at the age of 20 or younger. That year, he also won a game against Cy Young and met his future wife Marie.Swift, p. 108 In 1905, Bender earned an 18‚Äì11 win-loss record with a 2.83 ERA, helping the A's win the AL pennant; but they lost the World Series in five games to the New York Giants. Bender went 1‚Äì1, 1.06 ERA in the series, pitching a 4-hit, 3‚Äì0 complete game shutout in Game 2, striking out 9, and again went the distance in Game 5, giving up just two earned runs in eight innings and losing 2‚Äì0 to Christy Mathewson. After solid seasons in 1906 (15‚Äì10, 2.53), 1907 (16‚Äì8, 2.05), 1908 (8‚Äì9 despite a 1.75 ERA, and 1909 (18‚Äì8, 1.66), he led the Athletics to the AL pennant in 1910, as Philadelphia went 102‚Äì48, 14¬Ω games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees. Bender led the AL in winning percentage, at .821, going 23‚Äì5 with a 1.58 ERA. He went 1‚Äì1 with a 1.93 ERA in the World Series as the A's beat the Chicago Cubs, who had gone 104‚Äì50 in the regular season, in five games. Bender pitched a complete-game three-hitter in the opener, striking out 8 and giving up only one unearned run. He lost Game 4 of the series in another complete game effort, 4‚Äì3 in 10 innings. Bender pitched all 9‚Öî innings for the Athletics, striking out 6. =Later career= The four stars of the world champion Philadelphia Athletics ‚Äî Bender, Cy Morgan, Jack Coombs and Rube Oldring ‚Äî were featured in the Thanhouser Company film, The Baseball Bug (1911) In 1911, he led the AL in winning percentage again (.773), going 17‚Äì5 with a 2.16 ERA as the A's won their second consecutive AL pennant, going 101‚Äì50 and finishing 13¬Ω games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. In a rematch of the 1905 World Series, the Athletics got their revenge, defeating the New York Giants and becoming the first American League team to win back-to-back World Series (the Chicago Cubs from the NL had won back-to-back titles in 1907 and 1908). After losing the opener 2‚Äì1 to Christy Mathewson, though pitching a complete game, giving up just 5 hits and 2 runs (1 earned run) and striking out 11, he returned in Game 4, beating the Giants 4‚Äì2 on a complete game 7-hitter, and closed out the Series in game 6 with a 13‚Äì2 A's victory. Bender again went the distance (his 3rd complete game of the series), a 4-hit performance which he gave up no earned runs (the two Giants runs were unearned). He went 2‚Äì1, with 1.04 ERA and 3 complete games in the series. In 1912 Bender was 13‚Äì8 with a 2.74 ERA. He did not start for nearly 40 games late in the year and was suspended by the A's in September for alcohol abuse. His next contract had a clause saying he had to abstain from drinking to earn his full salary. In 1913, he went 21‚Äì10 with a 2.21 ERA, helping the A's win their third AL pennant in four years. They would also make it three World Series titles in four years by defeating the Giants in five games. Bender went 2‚Äì0 in the series with complete-game victories in Games 1 and 4. He led the AL in winning percentage (.850) for the third time in 1914, going 17‚Äì3 with a 2.26 ERA, and the A's would win their fourth AL pennant in five years. But the Philadelphia Athletics would be swept by the underdog Boston Braves, with Bender losing Game 1 7‚Äì1 and giving up 6 earned runs in 5‚Öì innings. It was the only World Series game he failed to finish, after completing his previous nine starts in the Fall Classic. When the Baltimore Terrapins of the upstart Federal League offered Bender a significant increase in salary, Athletics manager Connie Mack knew he could not hope to match it and released him. Bender went 4‚Äì16 for the Terrapins and later regretted leaving Philadelphia. After two years with the Phillies, he left baseball in 1918 to work in the shipyards during World War I. Over his career, his win-loss record was 212‚Äì127, for a .625 winning percentage (a category in which he led the American League in three seasons), and a career 2.46 ERA. His talent was even more noticeable in the high-pressure environment of the World Series; in five trips to the championship series, he managed six wins and a 2.44 ERA, completing 9 of the 10 games he started, putting him 2nd in World Series history behind Christy Mathewson. In the 1911 Series, he pitched three complete games to tie Christy Mathewson's record of three complete games in a World Series. He also threw a no-hitter on May 12, 1910, beating the Cleveland Indians 4‚Äì0. Bender was a very adept hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .212 batting average (243-for-1,147) with 102 runs, 6 home runs and 116 RBI. He had 10 or more RBI in a season four times, with a career high 16 in 1910. =Minor leagues= In 1919, Bender pitched in the minor leagues for the Richmond Colts of the Virginia League. He earned a 29‚Äì2 record that year. He spent the next three seasons as a player- manager; the first two seasons were with the New Haven Weissmen/Indians, and the third was with the Class AA Reading Aces. For the 1920 New Haven team, Bender recorded 25 wins as a pitcher. His record declined to 13‚Äì7 in 1921 and 8‚Äì13 in 1922. In 1923 and 1924, Bender did not manage, but did pitch for the minor league Baltimore Orioles and the New Haven Profs, respectively. He went 6‚Äì3 with a 5.03 ERA for Baltimore, then went 6‚Äì4 with a 3.07 ERA for New Haven. =Coaching career= He came back to the majors as a coach for the Chicago White Sox (1925‚Äì26) and even made a cameo appearance on the mound in 1925. Between 1924 and 1928, Bender managed the baseball team at the United States Naval Academy. He recorded a 42‚Äì34‚Äì2 record for the Naval Academy. In 1931, he coached for the Giants and the next year managed the Yankee affiliate in the Central League. He then returned to the Athletics where he worked the rest of his life as a scout, minor league manager, and coach. Personal Bender was nicknamed \\"Chief\\", a common nickname for baseball players of Native American descent.Swift, p. 4 Biographer Tom Swift writes that Bender \\"was often portrayed as a caricature and was the subject of myriad cartoons ‚Äì many exhibits of narrow-mindedness. After he threw one of the most dominating games of the early years of the American League, Bender was depicted wielding a tomahawk and wearing a headdress as though he was a happy warrior.\\"Swift, p. 5 He also faced discrimination on the field. Swift writes that taunting from the bench was common in Bender's era and that the opposition or the fans often made war whoops or yelled taunts such as \\"Nig!\\" or \\"Back to the reservation!\\" Bender usually remained calm, sometimes smiling at the insults. After an inning in which he had pitched particularly well, he might yell back, \\"Foreigners! Foreigners!\\"Swift, p. 6 Off the baseball field, Bender was one of several prominent baseball players who enjoyed trap shooting, bowling and golf. He felt that shooting in the offseason helped to train his eye and increase his self-control. He worked in sporting goods at Wanamaker's in Philadelphia during his early playing days.Kashatus, p. 140 He opened his own store, Bender Sporting Goods, in 1914. Bender's brother, John C. Bender, also played professional baseball. John Bender was suspended from minor league baseball for three years beginning in 1908 after he stabbed his manager, Win Clark, several times during a fight. John Bender is sometimes erroneously described as having died on a baseball field, but he died at a restaurant in 1911, not long after attempting a professional baseball comeback. Later life Late in his life, Bender's friend John Burns gave him a plot of land in Haddon Heights, New Jersey. Bender planted a garden on the land and worked with it almost every day, even though he lived in Philadelphia. He grew a number of fruits and vegetables, especially corn, and either ate, sold or gave away what he grew.Swift, pp. 281-282 After the 1950 season, Bender took his last position in the major leagues, replacing Mickey Cochrane as the pitching coach for the Athletics.Kashatus, p. 146 Bender's coaching helped pitcher Bobby Shantz to the American League Most Valuable Player Award in 1952.Kashatus, p. 148 Bender was struggling with health problems, including arthritis and a cancer he did not disclose, during his tenure with Philadelphia.Kashatus, p. 149 In his last days, Bender remained close friends with Athletics coach Bing Miller, who used to bring Bender a container of ice cream almost every day. Bender was hospitalized in Philadelphia in mid-April 1954. He died there on May 22, 1954, of prostate cancer. He had also been suffering from cardiac problems.Swift, p. 285 While he had been hospitalized, Bender sent Marie to Shibe Park for each home game so that she could report back to him on his team's pitching. Bender was buried in the Philadelphia suburb of Roslyn, Pennsylvania. Legacy Bender was well-liked by his fellow players. Long-time roommate and fellow pitcher Rube Bressler called him \\"one of the kindest and finest men who ever lived\\". Ty Cobb praised his intelligence, describing a play by Bender in the 1911 World Series as \\"the greatest bit of brainwork I ever saw in a ballgame\\".Swift, p. 162 Cobb was not alone in regard for his intelligence; Bender drew similar praise from many other teammates, opponents, and umpires, including Billy Evans and Nap Lajoie. Bender was also known for his keen eyes and ability to discern subtle details of opposing pitchers' motions to help his teammates predict their pitches. His success led other teams to suspect Bender and the Athletics were stealing signs; though teammate Cy Morgan denied the A's were stealing signs, Danny Murphy praised Bender's ability and said he could \\"come pretty near to getting anybody's signs\\". Mack often put this skill to use by occasionally using him as the third base coach or first base coach on days he wasn't scheduled to pitch.Swift, pp. 187-191 The innovator of the slider is debated, but some credit Bender as the first to use the pitch, then called a \\"nickel curve\\", in the 1910s.\\"WISCONSIN Magazine of History\\",Wisconsin Historical Society Press, Spring 2004 issue. Accessed July 8, 2007. Bender used his slider to help him achieve a no-hitter and win 212 games.\\"National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum: Hall of Famer detail\\" ,National Baseball Hall of Fame. Accessed July 8, 2007. Bender was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953, less than a year before his death. He died before his induction ceremony and Marie accepted the Hall of Fame plaque on his behalf.Kashatus, p. 152 In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.

The containers and panniers that carry food have been removed for loading. Freight bicycles, carrier cycles, freight tricycles, cargo bikes, box bikes, or cycletrucks are human powered vehicles designed and constructed specifically for transporting loads. Vehicle designs include a cargo area consisting of an open or enclosed box, a flat platform, or a wire basket, usually mounted over one or both wheels, low behind the front wheel, or between parallel wheels at either the front or rear of the vehicle. The frame and drivetrain must be constructed to handle loads larger than those on an ordinary bicycle.  Development  The first freight bicycles were used by tradesmen to deliver mail, bread and milk amongst other things. Early freight bicycles were heavy-duty standard bicycles, with heavy carriers at front or rear, sometimes with a smaller front wheel to accommodate a large front carrier. During the early part of the 20th century these were commonly used by tradesmen for local deliveries. In the UK this style is still sometimes known as a butcher's bike or delibike, although the Post Office have by far the largest fleet. With the domination of the internal combustion engine in the industrialized countries after World War II, freight bikes became less popular. In the rest of the world, however, they continued to be manufactured and heavily used. In the 1980s in Europe, and the 1990s in the US, ecologically-minded designers and small-scale manufacturers initiated a revival of the freight bike manufacturing sector.  Common uses  Freight bikes are used in a variety of settings: * Delivery services in dense urban environments * Food vending in high foot traffic areas (including specialist ice cream bikes) * Transporting trade tools, including around large installations such as power stations and CERN * Airport cargo handling * Recycling collections * Warehouse inventory transportation * Mail delivery (The UK post office operates a fleet of 33,000 bicycles, mainly the Pashley MailStar) *Child transport; it is estimated that 90% of the freight bicycles sold in Amsterdam are used primarily to carry children.  Considerations  Freight bicycles have a number of advantages over motorized vehicles: * They do not create air pollution problems (e.g. enclosed warehouses and industrial plants) * They are less costly to operate * They are silent * They are not limited by the availability of fuel * They are less dangerous than most of the other road vehicles * They contribute much less to traffic jams A limitation of any human-powered vehicle is the relative weakness of human power compared to many motors, leaving a narrow scope for balancing tare weight, payload, geographical and topographical range against each other. These limitations might in some cases dissuade some people from using cargo bikes, whereas others still find them useful, and have been in increasing numbers. Some cargo bike makers and users utilize power assist motors to complement the power of the cyclist. Power assist can increase the payload and range of cargo bikes, but also increases the cost of the bicycle and requires on-board fuel or other energy storage. Because of the unavoidable physical demands on a driver who also has to propel the vehicle, and the lack of protection against either the elements or other traffic, there is also a potential for working conditions becoming a problem. Technical efforts to improve conditions are hampered by the need for low weight and sturdy simplicity to achieve low costs in small- scale operations.  Types  Cargo bike in Copenhagen In Amsterdam and Copenhagen, freight bikes are extremely popular. In Amsterdam many residents simply fit large front carriers to sturdy city bicycles. There is also a broad variety of specially made freight bikes including low-loading two-wheelers with extended wheelbases, bicycles with small front wheels to fit huge front carriers, tadpole-type three-wheelers with a box between the two front wheels. Varieties used elsewhere include a platform, basket etc. instead of the box, the loading area between two rear wheels (delta-fashion), small-wheel two- wheelers loading both back and front. An occasional four-wheeler can also be seen, especially within a plant, warehouse or the like, where demands on stability and loading capacity are higher than on range. Many models are now available with an electric assist which can make them more useful for longer distances or for varied terrain, i.e. not flat cities, amongst other reasons, such as feeling more confident riding in car traffic due to faster acceleration from stopping. = Cycle truck = The Cycle truck refers to a type of freight bicycle with a smaller front wheel than rear, typically rear and front. = Butcher's bike = Typical 1930's Butcher's Bike, in the Forest of Dean Also referred to as a Baker's bike, however this style of freight bicycle was popular with a wide variety of trades during the first half of the 20th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. Typically, they would have a basket or storage box mounted within a framework which was fixed to the frame (not the fork) of the bike. Often, they would also feature a sign advertising the business concerned, which would be attached within the main triangle of the bicycle frame.http://tradesmansbike.wordpress.com/ Cycle truck typically also employed the same basket/rack to fram arrangement, as sold by Schwinn's cycle-truck. Their popularity declined significantly towards the end of the 1950s, with the increase of motorised transport, and their use today is largely limited to postal delivery services. = Boda-boda = A boda-boda (or bodaboda) is a two-wheeled bicycle or motorcycle taxi, originally in East Africa. Boda Bodahttp://yubabikes.com/cargo-bikes/boda-boda/ is also the name of Yuba Bicycles compact cargo bike introduced in 2012. = Long John bicycle = Danish Long John freight bicycle, 3-speed hub The Long John Bicycle is a freight bicycle with the cargo area in front of the rider and some linkage connecting the steering to the front wheel, \\"linkage steering\\". Capacity is usually about . A traditional Long John will have a smaller front wheel and a rear wheel, plus a long platform, basket, or box located low, in front of the handlebars. Recently, the term \\"bakfiets\\" (which means \\"box bike\\" in Dutch; plural is \\"bakfietsen\\") has sometimes been used to describe Long Johns and even cargo bikes, in general. Slightly shorter versions of Long Johns are also sometimes referred to as \\"cycletrucks\\". Vintage Long Johns are becoming collectible. The last known manufacturer to still produce the original Long John is Monark. The history of Long John Bicycles is traced to Denmark . The Smith & Co. Company (SCO - founded by Ivar Smith and Robert Jacobsen in Odense, Denmark 17 October 1894) was the inventor and the first to build this type of cargo bicycle. The first Long-John was presented to the public at the Wembley World Fair & Exhibition in 1924. This style of bicycle is useful for carrying freight but also young children and can function as a car replacement for many families with appropriate safe infrastructure in place in their towns or cities. This is one of the easiest ways to transport very young children (i.e. babies) as the platform or box is large enough to accommodate an infant bucket-style car seat. When children get older, they are often seated on a small bench and clipped in with a 3- or 5-point harness. Canopies are often sold or homemade that can be affixed to the cargo box for protection from the elements, making a warm and inviting space for children to enjoy the ride. = Off-road Long John bicycle = Offroad Long John bicycle, 80x60 cm cargo area, twin motors The range of Long John style cargobikes extends to off-road applications. Such designs can cover difficult terrain such as sand, mud, and snow, by using fatbike tires, electric motors, and suitable ground clearance. This brings cargobikes into farms, national parks, 1st-response situations, and immunization programs. = Longtail bicycle = A Surly Big Dummy with handlebars and foot rests for a second rider Longtails have a longer than usual frame wheelbase at the rear compared to a standard bicycle. The extended rear better facilitates use as a freight bicycle or carrying multiple or adult passengers compared with shorter bicycles. They tend to handle more like regular bikes than cargo bikes with linkage steering. Xtracycle Free Radical as fitted to a Trek 820 MTB donor bike. Xtracycle developed the first longtail product, their Free Radical, which attaches to an existing 'donor' bicycle to make it a longtail bike in 1998. The growing popularity of Xtracycle inspired the Kona Ute, launched for the 2008 season. Surly were asked by Xtracycle to build a complete Xtracycle-compatible frameset; the result was the 'Big Dummy', first released for the 2008 season. The chromoly frameset is designed for 26\\" wheels. Buyers have the choice of frameset alone or complete bicycle. In 2008 Xtracycle documented the LongTail as an open-source standard. This has helped individuals to build longtail bikes themselves such as the Xtravois. Xtracycle now offers a complete bike, the Xtracycle EdgeRunner, which allows for safer loading and unloading of children and is easier to handle and accelerate than other longtails because of its small 20\\" rear wheel. Since then LongTails have become a bike of choice to be outfitted with Electric- Power Assist systems. Yuba Bicycles launched the first complete longtail cargo bike with the Mundo.http://yubabikes.com/cargo-bikes/mundo/ Other complete longtail cargo bikes include the Surly Big Dummy. Bike Friday has a unique longtail cargo bike, the Haul-a-Day, with a main frame that adjusts in size for riders from 4'0\\" to 6'6\\" tall. It is claimed to be the world's lightest longtail cargo bike. Bike43 has a longtail with a 20\\" rear wheel to lower the weight of the payload. The goal is to make the bicycle stable even with 2 or 3 children onboard. The frame is made in Europe from Cromoly steel for stiffness strength and durability.http://www.bike43.com There is a sub-class of longtail bicycles referred to as midtails. As their name implies, they are not quite as long as a longtail, but can still often carry at least one if not two children. The Yuba BodaBoda is one such bike, as are the Tern GSD and HSD. The Bike Friday Haul-a-Day initially fit in this category, but can arguably carry as many kids as an Xtracycle Edgerunner (longtail). The Kona Ute is a longtail, and the Kona Minute is its midtail counterpart. = Wooden freight bicycle = Chukudu transporting bananas to market in the North Kivu province of DR Congo. The chukudu (or chikudu, cbokoudou) is a two-wheeled vehicle used in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is made of wood, and used for transporting freight. = Porteur bicycle = A modern bicycle styled after the classic French Porteur bicycle A porteur bicycle has the rack on the front, and can carry as much as that way. = Tricycles = Cycle rickshaw in Dhaka Cycle rickshaws are used for the short range transport of both people and goods while tricycles with boxes or platforms are used to transport goods. A cargo tricycle with an open or flat platform might be used for low value goods or for trips where the rider is always with the goods. A fabric cover can be added to provide weather protection. Tricycles can also be fitted with a lockable weatherproof box, usually of aluminium construction, for valuable goods and where the rider has to leave the vehicle. Cargo tricycles can typically carry of cargo and have capacity of or more, which is about half the capacity of a small panel van. The weight capacity of tricycles is limited by available human power and the permitted power of electric assist by law.

Arboriculture () is the cultivation, management, and study of individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other perennial woody plants. The science of arboriculture studies how these plants grow and respond to cultural practices and to their environment. The practice of arboriculture includes cultural techniques such as selection, planting, training, fertilization, pest and pathogen control, pruning, shaping, and removal. A person who practices or studies arboriculture can be termed an 'arborist' or an 'arboriculturist'. A 'tree surgeon' is more typically someone who is trained in the physical maintenance and manipulation of trees and therefore more a part of the arboriculture process rather than an arborist. Risk management, legal issues, and aesthetic considerations have come to play prominent roles in the practice of arboriculture. Businesses often need to hire arboriculturists to complete \\"tree hazard surveys\\" and generally manage the trees on-site to fulfill occupational safety and health obligations. Arboriculture is primarily focused on individual woody plants and trees maintained for permanent landscape and amenity purposes, usually in gardens, parks or other populated settings, by arborists, for the enjoyment, protection, and benefit of people. Arboricultural matters are also considered to be within the practice of urban forestry yet the clear and separate divisions are not distinct or discreet. UK Within the United Kingdom trees are considered as a material consideration within the town planning system and may be conserved as amenity landscape features. The role of the Arborist or Local Government Arboricultural Officer is likely to have a great effect on such matters. Identification of trees of high quality which may have extensive longevity is a key element in the preservation of trees. Urban and rural trees may benefit from statutory protection under the Town and Country Planning system. Such protection can result in the conservation and improvement of the urban forest as well as rural settlements. Historically the profession divides into the operational and professional areas. These maybe further subdivided into the Private and Public sectors. The profession is broadly considered as having one trade body known as the Arboricultural Association, although the Institute of Chartered Foresters offers a route of Professional recognition and status. The qualifications associated with the industry range from vocational to Doctorate and as a comparatively young industry, the opportunities are as yet limited and are based in many cases on agricultural wages.

They are: * Striking the opponent with a closed fist. * Grabbing the opponent's hair. * Jabbing at the opponent's eyes or solar plexus. * Simultaneously striking both of the opponent's ears with the palms. * Grabbing or pulling the opponent's groin. * Grabbing the opponent's throat. * Kicking at the opponent's chest or waist. * Bending back one or more of the opponent's fingers. Any of these is grounds for immediate disqualification (hansoku) owing to the potential for long-lasting harm to the wrestler involved. They are exceedingly rare and unlikely to be seen in the higher divisions of sumo, especially by the sekitori wrestlers. Additionally, if a wrestler's mawashi becomes undone, they will be similarly disqualified. Perhaps the most common kinjite committed is the grabbing of the opponent's hair. Since it is tied up in a form of chonmage one's hand can become inadvertently tangled in it during a bout. Itai pulled his opponent's hair on two consecutive days when ranked in the j≈´ry≈ç division in May 1980. Other rikishi to have been disqualified in this way include ≈çzeki Daikirin and yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ in July 2003, and ≈çzeki Tochinoshin in September 2019. Whilst grabbing the throat is not allowed, pushing the opponent backwards with an open hand against the throat (called a nodowa) is permitted, and is actually quite common. In addition, there are moves that are permitted to professional rikishi and forbidden to more junior (school level) wrestlers. One such move is harite -- slapping the opponent's face with an open hand. Kinjite also refers to an illegal move in shogi.

TLW was created in April, 1993 by the Southern Baptists,Guilty Pleasures: Religion and Sex Among American University Students, Huffington Post, July 20, 2010 and is sponsored by LifeWay Christian Resources. It is based on conservative Christian views of human sexuality that require one to be faithful to one's husband or wife.  Pledge  The True Love Waits pledge states: \\"Believing that true love waits, I make a commitment to God, myself, my family, my friends, my future mate and my future children to be sexually abstinent from this day until the day I enter a biblical marriage relationship.\\" In addition, they promote sexual purity, which encompasses not only abstaining from intercourse before marriage, but also abstaining from sexual thoughts, sexual touching, pornography, and actions that are known to lead to sexual arousal.\\" By the late 1990s, Christian music groups were promoting the program, and events similar to youth rallies were held at Christian music concerts, providing an opportunity for adolescents to sign pledge cards. Impact In the first year of the campaign, over 102,000 young people signed the pledge, which was also taken up by other church groups including the Roman Catholic Church and Assemblies of God. The campaign has continued to spread across the US, making the use of occasions such as Valentine's Day to gain attention.True Love Waits achieves Valentine's Day presence, The Washington Times, February 15, 1997 As of 2004, groups supporting abstinence numbered in the hundreds. During the previous decade, approximately 2.5 million American youth took the pledge of abstinence. Criticism The efficacy of the program has been questioned not only by studies, but also by contemporary Christian music artists who previously supported the cause. A 2003 study showing that 3 out of 5 college students who had taken the pledge had broken it, and of the 40% who identified themselves as abstaining from intercourse, 55% acknowledged having participated in oral sex. In the 2011 book Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns, Christine Gardner criticizes True Love Waits for \\"using sex to sell abstinence\\" by promising more satisfying sexual activity within marriage for those who abstain from premarital sex; she argues that this rhetoric reinforces selfish desires for gratification, sets people up for divorce and dissatisfaction with marriage, and simply adapts \\"secular forms for religious ends\\". The Jonas Brothers made an abstinence pledge through True Love Waits as teens. The band and pledge are satirized in the 2009 South Park episode The Ring. In 2013, Morgan Lee, a journalist of The Christian Post, conducted an interview with Joe Jonas and wrote: See also * Fornication * Virginity pledge * Silver Ring Thing References Further reading * Virgin Nation: Sexual Purity and American Adolescence by Sara Moslener, Oxford University Press, 2015.

These rockets cannot be fired to target specific military objectives in or near civilian areas, and are \\"indiscriminate when used against targets in population centers.\\" Three models have been produced and used, the first being introduced in 2001. More generally, all types of Palestinian rockets fired into southern Israel, for example the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Al Quds rockets, are called Qassams by the Israeli media, and often by foreign media. History of the Qassam =Name= Qassam rockets are named after the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed branch of Hamas, itself named for Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a Syrian Muslim preacher whose death during a guerrilla raid against British Mandatory authorities in 1935 was one of the catalysts for the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine. =Rocket launches= The production of Qassams began in September 2001 following the outbreak of the Second Intifada. The first Qassam to be launched was the Qassam-1, fired on October 2001, with a maximum range of to . The first time Palestinians launched rockets into Israel, rather than at an Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip, occurred on February 10, 2002. One of the rockets landed in Kibbutz Saad. Two Qassam rockets landed in the southern Israeli city of Sderot, the first city hit, on March 5, 2002. Some rockets have hit as far as the edge of Ashkelon. By the end of December 2008, a total of 15 people had been killed by Palestinian rockets since attacks began in 2001. Incidents: June 28, 2004 (2 killed), September 29, 2004 (2 killed), January 15, 2005 (1 killed), June 7, 2005 (3 killed), July 14, 2005 (1 killed), November 15, 2006 (1 killed), November 21, 2006 (1 killed), May 21, 2007 (1 killed), May 27, 2007 (1 killed), February 27, 2008 (1 killed), May 12, 2008 (1 killed) Since 2000, Palestinian rockets, which include the Qassam, alongside others such as the Grad rocket, have been used to kill 22 Israeli citizens and one Thai national (as of January 9, 2009). Rocket, design and cost =The rocket= Rockets being exhibited The Qassam rocket is the best- known type of rocket deployed by Palestinian militants, mainly against Israeli civilians, but also some military targets during the Second Intifada of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.Gaza's rocket threat to Israel, BBC, 21 January 2008Hamas Must End Attacks Against Civilians, Cease Use of Qassam Rockets, Human Rights Watch, 8 June 2005 According to Human Rights Watch, Qassam rockets are too inaccurate and prone to malfunction to be used against specific military targets in or near civilian areas, and are mainly launched for the purpose of \\"harming civilians.\\" =Design= The utility of the Qassam rocket design is assumed to be ease and speed of manufacture, using common tools and components. To this end, the rockets are propelled by a solid mixture of sugar and potassium nitrate, a common fertilizer. The warhead is filled with smuggled or scavenged TNT and urea nitrate, another common fertilizer. This is similar to the civilian explosive ammonite. The rocket consists of a steel cylinder, containing a rectangular block of the propellant. A steel plate which forms and supports the nozzles is then spot- welded to the base of the cylinder. The warhead consists of a simple metal shell surrounding the explosives, and is triggered by a fuse constructed using a simple firearm cartridge, a spring and a nail. While early designs used a single nozzle which screwed into the base, later rockets use a seven-nozzle design, with the nozzles drilled directly into the rocket baseplate. This alteration both increases the tolerance of the rocket to small nozzle design defects, and makes manufacture easier by allowing the use of a drill rather than a lathe during manufacture due to the smaller nozzle size. However, due to the cone shape of each of the 7 nozzles, the interior of each nozzle requires the use of a lathe, as it would otherwise be cylindrical rather than conical (see rocket engine nozzle). Unlike many other rockets, the nozzles are not canted, which means the rocket does not spin about its longitudinal axis during flight. While this results in a significant decrease in accuracy, it greatly simplifies rocket manufacture and the launch systems required. = Cost = The cost of the materials used for manufacturing each Qassam is up to $800 or ‚Ç¨500 (in 2008/9) per rocket. \\"The raw materials for one rocket can cost up to $800.\\" Reaction =Israeli = right The introduction of the Qassam rocket was unexpected by Israeli politicians and military experts, and reactions have been mixed. In 2006, the Israeli Ministry of Defense viewed the Qassams as \\"more a psychological than physical threat.\\" A 2008 study found that over half of Sderot's residents have been hurt, either physically or psychologically by the use of Qassams. The Israel Defense Forces has reacted to the deployment of the Qassam rockets by deploying the Red Color early warning system in Sderot, Ashkelon and other potential targets placed at risk. The system consists of an advanced radar that detects rockets as they are being launched, and loudspeakers warn civilians to take cover between 15 and 45 seconds before impact in an attempt to minimize the threat posed by the rockets. A system called Iron Dome, designed to intercept the rockets before they can hit their targets, has been in use since March 2011. A system based on lasers (Nautilios) was researched in a joint Israeli-American project in the early 2000s, but was discontinued. =Palestinian = The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas stated \\"There is no justification for rockets from Gaza or anywhere else,\\" He later added \\"Rocket attacks are in vain because they do not bring peace any closer.\\" Ibrahim Khreisheh, the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), stated in an PA TV interview on July 9, 2014 (translated by MEMRI) that indiscriminate Hamas rockets from densely populated residential areas are \\"crimes against humanity\\", while Israeli strikes are legal responses. =From others= According to a public document issued in July 2014, Amnesty International \\"has documented that Palestinian armed groups have stored munitions in and fired indiscriminate rockets from residential areas in the Gaza Strip, and available evidence indicates that they continue to do both during the current hostilities, in violation of international humanitarian law (..) Under international humanitarian law, (..) Parties to the conflict must also take necessary precautions to protect civilians in their power from the effects of attack. This includes avoiding, to the maximum extent feasible, co-locating military objectives in the vicinity of densely populated civilian neighbourhoods. This means the parties should avoid endangering civilians by storing ammunition in, and launching attacks from, populated civilian areas.\\" Human Rights Watch issued an analysis, stating, that \\"such weapons are therefore indiscriminate when used against targets in population centers. The absence of Israeli military forces in the areas where rockets have hit, as well as statements by leaders of Palestinian armed groups that population centers were being targeted, indicate that the armed groups deliberately attacked Israeli civilians and civilian objects.\\" Furthermore, the public document by Human Rights Watch stated, that \\"Hamas, the ruling authority in Gaza, is obligated to uphold the laws of war and should appropriately punish those responsible for serious violations\\". The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets as illegal under international law. An online clock timer, developed by Aaron Friedman and Yehonatan Tsirolnik, that automatically resets when Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel occur, uses information from the IDF Home Front Command system and counts time up from the last Palestinian rocket attack on Israel. It displays how long Israel has been rocket free and shows the summed up total numbers of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. \\"Israel has been under non stop rocket attacks for years (..) Whenever a rocket is fired, it restarts. Sadly, this counter never really gets above an hour\\", Friedman said on July 18, 2014 during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. An amateur YouTube video, showing the Israeli iron dome defense system at a military checkpoint near a crossing into Gaza taking out multiple Qassam rockets was uploaded in 2014. Similar Palestinian rockets Other Palestinian militant groups have also developed home-made rockets. The media generally refer to all Palestinian high- trajectory rockets as \\"Qassam rockets\\" or \\"Qassam missiles\\", while they call most rockets fired from Lebanon \\"Katyushas\\", as a Katyusha is not a specific model but rather a generic class of rocket. * Palestinian Islamic Jihad ‚Äì Al Quds 101 & 2 * Popular Resistance Committees ‚Äì al Nasser-3 * Tanzim ‚Äì Saria-2 * Fatah ‚Äì Kafah The Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center estimated that in 2007 the proportions of rockets fired were: : 34% ‚Äì Palestinian Islamic Jihad : 22% ‚Äì Hamas : 8% ‚Äì Fatah : 6% ‚Äì Popular Resistance Committees : 30% ‚Äì unknown The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center reports that the number of Palestinian rockets fired per year were: : 2001: 4 : 2002: 35 : 2003: 155 : 2004: 281 : 2005: 179 : 2006: 946 : 2007: 896 : 2008: 2,048 See also * Ababeel1 * Improvised artillery in the Syrian Civil War References External links *GlobalSecurity.org ‚Äì Qassam Rocket *The Homemade Rocket That Could Change The Mideast ‚Äì By Tony Karon, TIME Online Edition (10 February 2002) *Qassam-2 missile a wild card in Mideast conflict ‚Äì CNN (March 5, 2002) *Gaza rockets kill two in Israel, BBC article (June 28, 2004) *A Visit to a Gaza Rocket Factory, by Ulrike Putz, der Spiegel international (January 29, 2008, in English) *Katyusha & Qassam Rockets on www.aerospaceweb.org *Photos: Qassam rockets in Sderot * Gaza's Bottle Rockets - Why Hamas' Arsenal Wasn't Worth a War (2014-08-03), Mark Perry, Foreign Affairs * Gabi Siboni, The Operational Aspects to Fighting the Qassam, \\"Military and Strategic Affairs\\", Volume 9, No. 3, November 2006.

He was a younger brother of Theodor and Asen who led the anti-Byzantine uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs in 1185. The uprising ended with the restoration of the independence of Bulgaria. He spent years as a hostage in Constantinople in the late 1180s. Theodor (who had been crowned emperor under the name Peter) made him his co- ruler after Asen was murdered in 1196. A year later, Theodor-Peter was also assassinated, and Kaloyan became the sole ruler of Bulgaria. To obtain an imperial crown from the Holy See, Kaloyan entered into correspondence with Pope Innocent III, offering to acknowledge papal primacy. His expansionist policy brought him into conflict with the Byzantine Empire, Serbia and Hungary. Emeric, King of Hungary allowed the papal legate who delivered a royal crown to Kaloyan to enter Bulgaria only at the Pope's demand. The legate crowned Kaloyan \\"King of the Bulgarians and Vlachs\\" on 8November 1204, but Kaloyan continued to regard his realm as an empire. Kaloyan took advantage of the disintegration of the Byzantine Empire after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders (or \\"Latins\\") in 1204. He captured fortresses in Macedonia and Thrace and supported the local population's riots against the crusaders. He defeated Baldwin I, Latin emperor of Constantinople, in the Battle of Adrianople on 14April 1205. Baldwin was captured; he died in Kaloyan's prison. He launched new campaigns against the crusaders and captured or destroyed dozens of their fortresses. He was thereafter known as Kaloyan the Romanslayer, because his troops murdered or captured thousands of Byzantines. He died under mysterious circumstances during the siege of Thessalonica in1207.  Early life  Kaloyan was the younger brother of Theodor and Asen, noted as the instigators of the uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire in 1185. Theodor was crowned emperor and adopted the name Peter in 1185. Asen became Peter's co-ruler before 1190. They secured the independence of their realm with the assistance of Cuman warriors from the Pontic steppes. Kaloyan, who was still a teenager in 1188, must have been born around 1170, according to historian Alexandru Madgearu. He was baptised Ivan (or John), but he was called Johannitsa (\\"Little Ivan\\") because Ivan was also the baptismal name of his elder brother Asen. Kaloyan derived from the Greek expression for John the Handsome (Kallos Ioannis). His Greek enemies also called him Skyloioannes (\\"John the Dog\\"), which gave rise to references to Tsar Skaloyan or Scaluian in frescos in the Dragalevtsi Monastery and the Sucevi»õa Monastery. After the Byzantines captured Asen's wife, Kaloyan was sent as a hostage to Constantinople in exchange for her in the spring of 1188. The date of his release is not known. He was back in his homeland when a boyar, Ivanko, murdered Asen in Tarnovo in 1196. Ivanko attempted to obtain the throne with Byzantine support, but Theodor-Peter forced him to flee to the Byzantine Empire.  Reign  = Conflicts with the Byzantine Empire = The Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates mentioned that Theodor-Peter designated Kaloyan \\"to assist him in his labors and share in his rule\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (6.1.472), p. 259. at an unspecified time. Kaloyan became the sole ruler of Bulgaria after Theodor-Peter was murdered in 1197. Shortly afterwards he attacked the Byzantine province of Thrace and launched frequent raids against it during the following months. Around this time, he sent a letter to Pope Innocent III, urging him to dispatch an envoy to Bulgaria. He wanted to persuade the pope to acknowledge his rule in Bulgaria. Innocent eagerly entered into correspondence with Kaloyan because the reunification of the Christian denominations under his authority was one of his principal objectives. Kaloyan's leaden seal with the Bulgarian inscription \\"Kaloyan Tsar of the Bulgarians\\" The Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos made Ivanko the commander of Philippopolis (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria). Ivanko seized two fortresses in the Rhodopi Mountains from Kaloyan, but by 1198 he had made an alliance with him. Cumans and Vlachs from the lands to the north of the river Danube broke into the Byzantine Empire in the spring and autumn of 1199. Choniates, who recorded these events, did not mention that Kaloyan cooperated with the invaders, so it is likely that they crossed Bulgaria without his authorization. Kaloyan captured Braniƒçevo, Velbuzhd (now Kyustendil in Bulgaria), Skopje and Prizren from the Byzantines, most probably in that year, according to historian Alexandru Madgearu. Innocent III's envoy arrived in Bulgaria in late December 1199, bringing a letter from the Pope to Kaloyan. Innocent stated that he was informed that Kaloyan's forefathers had come \\"from the City of Rome\\". Kaloyan's answer, written in Old Church Slavonic, has not been preserved, but its content can be reconstructed based on his later correspondence with the Holy See. Kaloyan styled himself \\"Emperor of the Bulgarians and Vlachs\\", and asserted that he was the legitimate successor of the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire. He demanded an imperial crown from the Pope and expressed his wish to put the Bulgarian Orthodox Church under the pope's jurisdiction. The Byzantines captured Ivanko and occupied his lands in 1200. Kaloyan and his Cuman allies launched a new campaign against Byzantine territories in March 1201. He destroyed Constantia (now Simeonovgrad in Bulgaria) and captured Varna. He also supported the rebellion of Dobromir Chrysos and Manuel Kamytzes against Alexios III, but they were both defeated. Roman Mstislavich, prince of Halych and Volhynia, invaded the Cumans' territories, forcing them to return to their homeland in 1201. After the Cuman's retreat, Kaloyan concluded a peace treaty with Alexios III and withdrew his troops from Thrace in late 1201 or in 1202. According to Kaloyan's letter to the Pope, Alexios III was also willing to send an imperial crown to him and to acknowledge the autocaphalous (or autonomous) status of the Bulgarian Church. = Imperial ambitions = Vukan Nemanjiƒá, ruler of Zeta, expelled his brother, Stefan, from Serbia in 1202. Kaloyan gave shelter to Stefan and allowed the Cumans to invade Serbia across Bulgaria. He invaded Serbia himself and captured Ni≈° in the summer of 1203. According to Madgearu he also seized Dobromir Chrysos's realm, including its capital at Prosek. Emeric, King of Hungary, who claimed Belgrade, Braniƒçevo and Ni≈°, intervened in the conflict on Vukan's behalf. The Hungarian army occupied territories which were also claimed by Kaloyan. Since Vukan had already acknowledged papal primacy, Innocent III urged Kaloyan to make peace with him in September. In the same month, the papal legate, John of Casamari, gave a pallium to Basil I, the head of the Bulgarian Church, confirming his rank of archbishop, but denying his elevation to the rank of patriarch. Pope Innocent III's letter to Kaloyan Dissatisfied with the Pope's decision, Kaloyan sent a new letter to Rome, asking Innocent to send cardinals who could crown him emperor. He also informed the Pope that Emeric of Hungary had seized five Bulgarian bishoprics, asking Innocent to arbitrate in the dispute and determine the boundary between Bulgaria and Hungary. In the letter, he styled himself the \\"Emperor of the Bulgarians\\". The Pope did not accept Kaloyan's claim to an imperial crown, but dispatched Cardinal Leo Brancaleoni to Bulgaria in early 1204 to crown him king. Kaloyan sent envoys to the crusaders who were besieging Constantinople, offering military support to them if \\"they would crown him king so that he would be lord of his land of Vlachia\\", according to Robert of Clari's chronicle. However, the crusaders treated him with disdain and did not accept his offer. The crusaders captured Constantinople on 13April. They elected Baldwin IX of Flanders emperor and agreed to divide the Byzantine Empire among themselves. The papal legate, Brancaleoni, travelled through Hungary, but he was arrested at Keve (now Kovin in Serbia) on the Hungarian‚ÄìBulgarian frontier. Emeric of Hungary urged the cardinal to summon Kaloyan to Hungary and to arbitrate in their conflict. Brancaleoni was only released at the Pope's demand in late September or early October. He consecrated Basil primate of the Church of the Bulgarians and Vlachs on 7November. Next day, Brancaleone crowned Kaloyan king. In his subsequent letter to the Pope, Kaloyan styled himself as \\"King of Bulgaria and Vlachia\\", but referred to his realm as an empire and to Basil as a patriarch. = War with the Crusaders = Taking advantage of the disintegration of the Byzantine Empire, Kaloyan captured former Byzantine territories in Thrace. Initially he attempted to secure a peaceful division of the lands with the crusaders (or \\"Latins\\"). He asked Innocent III to prevent them from attacking Bulgaria. However, the crusaders wanted to implement their treaty which divided the Byzantine territories between them, including lands that Kaloyan claimed. Kaloyan gave shelter to Byzantine refugees and persuaded them to stir up riots in Thrace and Macedonia against the Latins. The refugees, according to Robert of Clari's account, also pledged they would elect him emperor if he invaded the Latin Empire. The Greek burghers of Adrianople (now Edirne in Turkey) and nearby towns rose up against the Latins in early 1205. Kaloyan promised that he would send them reinforcements before Easter. Considering Kaloyan's cooperation with the rebels a dangerous alliance, Emperor Baldwin decided to launch a counter- attack and ordered the withdrawal of his troops from Asia Minor. He laid siege to Adrianople before he could muster all his troops. Kaloyan hurried to the town at the head of an army of more than 14,000 Bulgarian, Vlach and Cuman warriors. A feigned retreat by the Cumans drew the heavy cavalry of the crusaders into an ambush in the marshes north of Adrianople, enabling Kaloyan to inflict a crushing defeat on them on 14April 1205. Bulgaria under Kaloyan (1197‚Äì1207) Baldwin was captured on the battlefield and died in captivity in Tarnovo. Choniates accused Kaloyan of having tortured and murdered Baldwin because he \\"seethed with anger\\"O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (9.642), p. 353. against the crusaders. George Akropolites added that Baldwin's head was \\"cleaned of all its contents and decorated all round with ornaments\\"George Akropolites: The History (ch. 13.), p. 139. to be used as a goblet by Kaloyan. On the other hand, Baldwin's brother and successor, Henry, informed the pope that Kaloyan behaved respectfully towards the crusaders who had been captured at Adrianople. Kaloyan's troops pillaged Thrace and Macedonia after his victory over the Latins. He launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Thessalonica, laying siege to Serres in late May. He promised free passage to the defenders, but after their surrender he broke his word and took them captive. He continued the campaign and seized Veria and Moglena (now Almopia in Greece). Most inhabitants of Veria were murdered or captured on his orders. Henry (who still ruled the Latin Empire as regent) launched a counter-invasion against Bulgaria in June. He could not capture Adrianople and a sudden flood forced him to lift the siege of Didymoteicho. Kaloyan decided to take vengeance of the townspeople of Philippopolis, who had voluntarily cooperated with the crusaders. With the assistance of the local Paulicians, he seized the town and ordered the murder of the most prominent burghers. The commoners were delivered in chains to Vlachia (a loosely defined territory, located to the south of the lower Danube). He returned to Tarnovo after a riot had broken out against him in the second half of 1205 or early 1206. He \\"subjected the rebels to harsh punishments and novel methods of execution\\",O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates (9.628), p. 344. according to Choniates. He again invaded Thrace in January 1206. He captured Rousion (now Ke≈üan in Turkey) and massacred its Latin garrison. He then destroyed most of the fortresses along the Via Egnatia, as far as Athira (present-day B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece in Turkey). The local inhabitants were captured and forcibly relocated to the lower Danube. Akropolites recorded that thereafter Kaloyan called himself \\"Romanslayer\\", with a clear reference to Basil II who had been known as the \\"Bulgarslayer\\" after his destruction of the First Bulgarian Empire. The massacre and capture of their compatriots outraged the Greeks in Thrace and Macedonia. They realized that Kaloyan was more hostile to them than the Latins. The burghers of Adrianople and Didymoteicho approached Henry offering their submission. Henry accepted the offer and assisted Theodore Branas in taking possession of the two towns. Kaloyan attacked Didymoteicho in June, but the crusaders forced him to lift the siege. Soon after Henry was crowned emperor on 20August, Kaloyan returned and destroyed Didymoteicho. He then laid siege to Adrianople, but Henry forced him to withdraw his troops from Thrace. Henry also broke into Bulgaria and released 20,000 prisoners in October. Boniface, King of Thessalonica, had meanwhile recaptured Serres. Kaloyan concluded an alliance with Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. Laskaris had started a war against David Komnenos, Emperor of Trebizond, who was supported by the Latins. He persuaded Kaloyan to invade Thrace, forcing Henry to withdraw his troops from Asia Minor. Kaloyan laid siege to Adrianople in April 1207, using trebuchets, but the defenders resisted. A month later, the Cumans abandoned Kaloyan's camp, because they wanted to return to the Pontic steppes, which compelled Kaloyan to lift the siege. Innocent III urged Kaloyan to make peace with the Latins, but he did not obey. Henry concluded a truce with Laskaris in July 1207. He also had a meeting with Boniface of Thessalonica, who acknowledged his suzerainty at Kypsela in Thrace. However, on his way back to Thessalonica, Boniface was ambushed and killed at Mosynopolis on 4September. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin local Bulgarians were the perpetrators and they sent Boniface's head to Kaloyan. Robert of Clari and Choniates recorded that Kaloyan had set up the ambush. Boniface was succeeded by his minor son, Demetrius. The child king's mother, Margaret of Hungary, took up the administration of the kingdom. Kaloyan hurried to Thessalonica and laid siege to the town. Death Church of the Holy Forty Martyrs in Tarnovo Kaloyan died during the siege of Thessalonica in October 1207, but the circumstances of his death are uncertain. Akropolites stated that he died of pleurisy. He also recorded a rumour claiming that Kaloyan's \\"death was caused by divine wrath; for it seemed to him that an armed man appeared before him in his sleep and struck his side with a spear\\".George Akropolites: The History (ch. 13.), p. 140. Legends about Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki's intervention on behalf of the besieged town were recorded shortly after Kaloyan's death. Robert of Clari wrote before 1216 that the saint himself came to Kaloyan's tent and \\"struck him with a lance through the body\\",The Conquest of Constantinople: Robert of Clari, p. 127. causing his death. Stefan Nemanjiƒá wrote down the same legend in 1216 in his hagiography of his father, Stefan Nemanja. John Staurakios, who compiled the legends of Saint Demetrius in the late 13th century, recorded that a man riding on a white horse struck Kaloyan with a lance. Kaloyan, continued Staurakios, associated the attacker with Manastras, the commander of his mercenaries, who thus had to flee before Kaloyan's death. The legend was depicted on the walls of more than five Orthodox churches and monasteries. For instance, a fresco in the Decani Monastery depicts Saint Demetrius slaying Tsar Skaloyan. The contradictory records of Kaloyan's death gave rise to multiple scholarly theories, many of them accepting that he was murdered. Madgearu says Kaloyan was actually murdered by Manastras, who had most probably been hired by Kaloyan's wife and nephew, Boril. Historians Genoveva Cankova-Petkova and Francesco Dall'Aglia also write that Manastras killed Kaloyan, but they assume that the Greeks had persuaded him to turn against the tsar. Facial reconstruction based on the skull found near Holy Forty Martyrs Church. The identification of the skull is disputed. The location of Kaloyan's grave is unknown. According to the late 13th-century version of the Life of Saint Sava of Serbia, Kaloyan's body was embalmed and delivered to Tarnovo. However, the older version of the same legend, recorded in 1254, does not mention this episode. A golden ring, which was found in a grave near the Church of the Holy Forty Martyrs in Tarnovo in 1972, bears the Cyrillic inscription Kaloianov prƒÉsten (\\"Kaloyan's ring\\"). Historian Ivan Dujƒçev stated that the ring proved that Kaloyan's remains were transferred to the church, which was built in 1230. Based on the skull found in the same grave and associated with Kaloyan, anthropologist Jordan Jordanov reconstructed Kaloyan's face. The identification of the grave as Kaloyan's burial place is controversial, because the ring bearing his name cannot be dated to before the 14th century. Furthermore, the graves of all other royals who were buried in the same place are located within the church, suggesting that the ring was not owned by Kaloyan, but by one of his 14th-century namesakes.  Family  Kaloyan's wife was a Cuman princess. She gave birth to Kaloyan's only known daughter (whose name is unknown). According to gossip recorded by Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Kaloyan's wife tried to seduce the Latin Emperor Baldwin who had been imprisoned in Tarnovo. However, the gossip continued, Baldwin refused her, for which she accused him of having tried to seduce her. Outraged by his wife's claim, Kaloyan had Baldwin executed and fed his corpse to the dogs. Based on the story of Potiphar and his wife, the rumour is obviously unreliable, according to Madgearu. After Kaloyan's death, his widow married his successor, Boril. Boril gave Kaloyan's daughter in marriage to the Latin Emperor Henry in 1211.

'High drive\\" refers to the position of the drive sprocket. The triangular track shape is caused by the need to accommodate the drive sprocket which is mounted high on the machine relative to ground level and higher than previous existing designs. A Caterpillar D9N on a beach CAT D9T, the current generation of the Caterpillar D9 tracked-type tractor series. The Caterpillar D9 is a large track-type tractor designed and manufactured by Caterpillar Inc. It is usually sold as a bulldozer equipped with a detachable large blade and a rear ripper attachment. The D9, with 354 kW (474 hp) of gross power and an operating weight of 49 tons, is in the upper end of Caterpillar's track-type tractors, which range in size from the D3 57 kW (77 hp), 8 tons, to the D11 698 kW (935 hp), 104 tons. The size, durability, reliability, and low operating costs have made the D9 one of the most popular large track-type tractors in the world. Engineering and technical description The D9 is a series of heavy tracked-type tractors, carried on continuous tracks and usually used as bulldozers. The series began in 1954 with a prototype tractor called the D9X. Ten D9X prototype models were built in 1954. In 1955, the D9 was introduced to compete against the more powerful Euclid TC-12. The D9 came equipped with a 1,473 cid D353, which powered the D9 until the 1980 introduction of the D9L. In 1956, the D9 had its engine power raised to . The new D9E replaced that model in 1959. Two years later, the legendary D9G was introduced; it remained in production for 13 years; it became the main crawler on many job sites, testifying to its sturdiness and design. In 1965, West Coast businessman Buster Peterson hooked up a pair of D9Gs to pushload the largest wheel tractor scrapers built. In 1968, Caterpillar bought the rights to this concept, thus the DD9G was created (DD stands for Dual D9G). Peterson also built the first SxS D9G, which has two D9Gs side-by-side, pushing a -wide bulldozer blade. In 1969, Caterpillar introduced this new SxS D9G. In 1974, the improved D9H was introduced to replace the D9G. The D9H is still the most powerful conventional track-type tractor in company history. The DD9H and the SxsD9H soon followed. In 1980, the D9L was introduced. The unit featured the same new type of elevated drive sprocket undercarriage as had been introduced on the larger D10 in 1977. The new undercarriage design reduced strain and shock loads on the final drives and gave the \\"belly pan\\" more ground clearance. The elevated-drive-sprocket undercarriage is a modular design. To repair the machines, one breaks down the tracks and pulls the drive sprockets out. As a result, one can pull the powershift transmission out the rear. The D9N replaced the D8L in 1987. In 1988, Caterpillar produced their 25,000th elevated-drive-sprocket track-type tractor, a D9N. The D9R replaced the D9N in 1996. The D9T replaced the D9R in 2004. The D9T has a low-emissions ACERT diesel engine. The current model is the D9T; however, older models such as the D9R, D9N, and D9L are still commonly used. The L, N, R, and T models of the D9 are visually very similar, differing primarily in the design of their internal systems. The D9L was replaced by the D10N in 1987. The D9N replaced D8L in 1987. The main difference between the D9T and the D9R is the installment of the new Cat C18 ACERT inline-six engine in the D9T vs the V8 3408 HEUI in the D9R. The D9R has clutch and brake steering, while the D9T has differential steering. The D9L is the most powerful D9 in history, with a flywheel power of 460 hp. The D9L is also the heaviest D9 in history at 130,000 lbs. The D9's primary working tools are the blade, affixed to the front and controlled by four hydraulic cylinders, and an optional ripper, which can be attached to the back. The blade is mainly intended for earthmoving and bulk material handling: pushing up sand, soil, and rubble. It also can be used to push other heavy equipment such as earthmoving scraper pans, and in military applications, main battle tanks. The dozer blade usually has three variants: * A straight blade (\\"S-blade\\") is short and has no lateral curve, with no side wings, and can be used for fine grading. * A universal blade (\\"U-blade\\") is tall and very curved, and has large side wings to carry more material. * A \\"S-U\\" combination blade is shorter, has less curvature, and has smaller side wings. This blade is typically used for pushing piles of large rocks, such as at a quarry. Like many other bulldozers, the D9 can be fitted with other devices, such as mine plows. The rear ripper is intended for use in loosening rocky ground and ripping out larger stones. It can also break frozen ground and excavate small ditches. The ripper can be replaced with a multishank ripper, allowing the bulldozer to comb the ground. The size, power, and weight of the larger track- type tractors dictate that they are used primarily for major projects. The D9 is most commonly found in use in construction, forestry, mining, waste, and quarry operations. Military applications An armored IDF Caterpillar D9R bulldozer, nicknamed \\"◊ì◊ï◊ë◊ô\\" (Teddy bear) in Israel. Its armor allows it to work under heavy fire. Requena (Spain) Caterpillar Inc. does not manufacture a military version of the D9 per se, but the attributes that make the D9 popular for major construction projects make it desirable for military applications, as well, and with Israeli modifications and armor, it has been particularly effective for the Israel Defense Forces and also used by KBR in Iraq. The US Army used D9 bulldozers to clear forest in the Vietnam War, but after the war, they were replaced with smaller and cheaper Caterpillar D7G bulldozers. D7G bulldozers are still very common in US combat engineering battalions, but a series of oft-recurrent suggestions have been made to replace the lighter D7Gs with the newer and more heavily armored D9s. The Caterpillar D9 have been used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since it was introduced, but an armored model, with Israeli-developed vehicle armor kit, was introduced only in 1986, on the D9L. The IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer is operated by combat soldiers from the Combat Engineering Corps (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ô◊ú ◊î◊î◊†◊ì◊°◊î ◊î◊ß◊®◊ë◊ô◊™) after going through a 2-month course. Many of the D9 operators are reservists and veterans, who operated heavy equipment also as civilians. The current models of the D9 employed by the IDF are the D9L, D9N, D9R, and D9T. Most of the IDF's D9 fleet today are composed of the D9R with slat armor. IDF D9 bulldozers were used during the Second Intifada (2000‚Äì2005) to demolish Palestinian structures and clear improvised explosive devices. The Israeli armor provides protection from small arms and explosives, and the bulldozers were used the Battle of Jenin 2002 during Operation Defensive Shield. A 2003 incident involving an IDF D9, in which a 23-year-old American activist was killed, resulted in a lawsuit brought against Catepillar, Inc. in the United States. The court dismissed the case on grounds that it was outside their jurisdiction, and that Israeli tort law was a sufficient avenue to pursue remedies. Today, the D9 is one of the main combat engineering tools of the IDF and is considered a valuable asset.

Early life Malet was the son of William Malet, and inherited his father's great honour of Eye in 1071. This made him one of the dozen or so greatest landholders in England. According to the Domesday book he held 221 manors in Suffolk, 32 in Yorkshire, eight in Lincolnshire, three in Essex, two in Nottinghamshire, and one in Hampshire.Domesday book, 1086 He also inherited the family property in Normandy. Public life From 1070 to 1080, Malet was High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and helped suppress the rebellion of Ralph Wader. Afterwards, he appeared frequently at King William I's court. All changed with the accession of William II. By 1094 Malet's English lands had been taken away from him. The reasons are unknown, and no more is known of Malet's activities during William II's reign. Most likely he was in Normandy, and it may be that his falling out with William II was due to his preference for Duke Robert of Normandy in the rivalry between the two brothers. Malet reappeared in the public record three days after the death of William II in 1100, as a witness to Henry I's coronation charter. He must have been with Henry at the time of William's death, or rushed from Normandy when word came. In any case, Malet soon regained his office as Sheriff of Suffolk, and his honour of Eye. It was thought that Malet had some quarrel with the king, and again lost his lands, on the basis of some statements by Orderic Vitalis, but most historians now think Orderic confused Malet with his successor, William Malet. However it appears that Robert Malet remained in the king's confidence and held his lands until his death. Some sources claim that a Robert Malet died at the battle of Tinchebrai (28 September 1106), though there is no specific evidence linking this to Robert Malet of Suffolk. Until some time before 1130, Malet was appointed Lord Great Chamberlain (or Master Chamberlain), the first person to hold this position. Little is known about the role attached at the time to this title or what it entailed. It is possible, however, that the position succeeded that of n Lord High Steward. While the rest of the financial responsibilities of the parent job were separated from that job and were given under the newly-formed title of Lord High Treasurer in 1126. So perhaps Malet became Lord Great Chamberlain in 1126 when the job of Lord High Treasurer seems to have been formed.

Upper ranked professional wrestlers wear a kesh≈ç-mawashi (see below) as part of the ring entry ceremony or dohy≈ç-iri. Mawashi Hakuh≈ç in silk mawashi worn by sekitori during tournaments For top ranked professional rikishi, it is made of silk and comes in a variety of colours. It is approximately in length when unwrapped, about two feet wide and weighs about . It is wrapped several times around the rikishi and fastened in the back by a large knot. A series of matching colour, stiffened silk fronds, called sagari are inserted into the front of the mawashi. Their number varies from 13 to 25, and is always an odd number. They mark out the only part of the mawashi that it is illegal to grab on to: the vertical part covering the sumotori's groin, and if they fall out during competition the gy≈çji (referee) will throw them from the ring at the first opportunity. Sometimes a rikishi may wear his mawashi in such a way as to give him some advantage over his opponent. He may wear it loosely to make it more difficult to be thrown, or he may wrap it tightly and splash a little water on it to help prevent his opponent from getting a good grip on it. His choice will depend on the type of techniques he prefers to employ in his bouts. Thus a wrestler preferring belt sumo will usually wear it more loosely, while those preferring pushing techniques will tend to wear the mawashi more tightly. Many rikishi are superstitious and they will change the color of their mawashi to change their luck. Sometimes a poor performance will cause them to change colors for the next tournament, or even during a tournament, in an attempt to change their luck for the better. An example of this was done by ≈ånosh≈ç during the 2020 July tournament, when after several loses in a row, he decided to change from a carmesi color to a dark gray one. Rikishi only wear the silk mawashi during competitive bouts either during ranking tournaments or touring displays. During training, a heavy cotton mawashi is worn. For senior rikishi in the top two divisions (the so-called sekitori), this belt is coloured white, and it is worn with one end distinctively looped at the front. Sagari are not worn during training. Sekitori in white cotton training mawashi Rikishi ranked in the lower divisions wear a black cotton mawashi both for training and in competition. In competition cotton sagari are inserted into the belt, but these are not stiffened. Amateur sumo wrestlers are expected to wear a white cotton mawashi without the looping accorded to the senior professional's training garb. If a wrestler's mawashi comes off during a tournament bout, he is automatically disqualified. This is extremely rare, but it did occur in May 2000 when sandanme wrestler Asanokiri was embarrassed during a match with Chiyohakuh≈ç. However, for most of sumo's history, whether or not a wrestler's mawashi came off during a bout was considered irrelevant, and the policy of disqualification only came into place when Japan began adopting European attitudes towards nudity. Kesh≈ç-mawashi Modern sumo wrestlers in top division ring entrance ceremony, wearing kesh≈ç-mawashi Wrestlers in the two upper divisions, makuuchi and j≈´ry≈ç, are allowed to wear a second ceremonial kesh≈ç-mawashi during their ring entering ceremony. The silk 'belt' opens out at one end into a large apron which is usually heavily embroidered and with thick tassels at the bottom. The kesh≈ç-mawashi may advertise the produce of a sponsor of the rikishi (for example Bulgarian ≈çzeki Koto≈çsh≈´ was sponsored by a Japanese brand of yogurt, \\"Bulgaria\\", which was prominently displayed on the front of his kesh≈ç-mawashi) or be a gift from one of the rikishi's support groups. Alternatively, some foreign-born rikishi (such as Czech-born Takanoyama) bear their national flag on their kesh≈ç-mawashi. Popular rikishi may be given many of these kesh≈ç-mawashi. Yokozuna have matching sets of three kesh≈ç-mawashi, with two being worn by his wrestler assistants (his tachimochi and tsuyuharai) during his ring entrance ceremony. In the Edo period the kesh≈ç-mawashi also served as the wrestler's fighting mawashi. However, as the aprons become more ornate, eventually the two functions were split apart. In this period wrestlers were normally sponsored by feudal daimy≈ç or overlords, whose clan crest would therefore appear on the kesh≈ç-mawashi.

It is located entirely within the borders of Ontario, Canada. The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island. To its northwest is the North Channel. Georgian Bay is surrounded by (listed clockwise) the districts of Manitoulin, Sudbury, Parry Sound and Muskoka, as well as the more populous counties of Simcoe, Grey and Bruce. The Main Channel separates the Bruce Peninsula from Manitoulin Island and connects Georgian Bay to the rest of Lake Huron. The North Channel, located between Manitoulin Island and the Sudbury District, west of Killarney, was once a popular route for steamships and is now used by a variety of pleasure craft to travel to and from Georgian Bay. The shores and waterways of the Georgian Bay are the traditional domain of the Anishinaabeg First Nations peoples to the north and Huron-Petun (Wyandot) to the south. The bay was thus a major Algonquian- Iroquoian trade route. Samuel de Champlain, the first European to explore and map the area in 1615‚Äì1616, called it \\"La Mer douce\\" (the calm sea), which was a reference to the bay's freshwater. In 1822, after Great Britain had taken over the territory, Lieutenant Henry Wolsey Bayfield of a Royal Navy expedition named it as \\"Georgian Bay\\" (after King George IV).Ketcheson, Graham.

The granite rock formations and windswept eastern white pine are characteristic of the islands and much of the shoreline of the bay. The rugged beauty of the area inspired landscapes by artists of the Group of Seven. The western part of the bay, from Collingwood north, and including Manitoulin, Drummond, Cockburn and St. Joseph islands, borders the Niagara Escarpment. Because of its size and narrowness of the straits joining it with the rest of Lake Huron, which is analogous to if not as pronounced as the separation of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan,\\"Great Lakes Sensitivity to Climatic Forcing: Hydrological Models .\\" NOAA, 2006. Georgian Bay is sometimes called the \\"sixth Great Lake\\". If Georgian Bay were considered a lake in its own right, it would be the fourth largest lake located entirely within Canada (after Great Bear Lake, Great Slave Lake and Lake Winnipeg). With Georgian Bay, Lake Huron is considered to be the second largest of the Great Lakes - if Georgian Bay were excluded, Lake Huron would be the third largest (after Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, but still ahead of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario). There are tens of thousands of islands in Georgian Bay. Most of these islands are along the east side of the bay and are collectively known as the \\"Thirty Thousand Islands\\", including the larger Parry Island. Manitoulin Island, lying along the northern side of the bay, is the world's largest island in a freshwater lake. The Trent‚ÄìSevern Waterway connects Georgian Bay to Lake Ontario, running from Port Severn in the southeastern corner of Georgian Bay through Lake Simcoe into Lake Ontario near Trenton. Further north, Lake Nipissing drains into Georgian Bay through the French River. In October 2004, the Georgian Bay Littoral was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. History Tom Thomson, Pine Island, Georgian Bay, Winter 1914-16. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Archaeological records reveal an Aboriginal presence in the southern regions of the Canadian Shield dating from 11,000 years ago. Evidence of later Paleo- Indian settlements have been found on Manitoulin Island and near Killarney. At the time of European contact, the Ojibwe and Ottawa First Nations, both of whom call themselves Anishinaabe (plural: Anishinaabeg), lived along the northern, eastern and western shores of Georgian Bay. The Huron (or Wendat) and Tionontati inhabited the lands along the southern coast, having migrated from the northern shores of Lake Ontario. Names of islands such as \\"Manitoulin\\" (from Gitchi Manitou, the Great Spirit who left the bay as a source of life for the first people) and \\"Giant's Tomb\\" are indicative of the richness of the cultural history of the area. Aboriginal communities continue to live on their territories and practise their cultural traditions. The first European to visit this area was likely √âtienne Br√ªl√©, who at age less than 20, in 1610 was sent to live as an interpreter trainee with the Onontchataronon, an Algonquian people of the Ottawa River. They travelled every winter to live with the Arendarhonon people of the Huron (Wendat) confederacy at the southern end of Georgian Bay, in the area now called \\"Huronia\\". Brul√© returned to the Arendarhonon the following year. At the same time another young interpreter trainee, a youth remembered only as Thomas, who was employed by the French surgeon and trader Daniel Boyer, also likely made it to Huronia, in the company of the Onontchataronon, another member of the confederacy. In 1615, Brul√©'s employer, the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, made his own visit to Georgian Bay and overwintered in Huronia. He was preceded that summer by a R√©collet missionary, Joseph Le Caron, who would live among the Huron in 1615‚Äì1616 and 1623‚Äì1624. Another R√©collet missionary, Gabriel Sagard, lived there from 1623‚Äì34. The French Jesuit Jean de Br√©beuf began a mission in Huronia in 1626. In 1639 he oversaw the building of the mission fort of Sainte-Marie, Ontario's first European settlement, at what is now the town of Midland. The reconstructed Jesuit mission, Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, is now a historic park operated by the province of Ontario. Also nearby is the Martyrs' Shrine, a Catholic church dedicated to the Canadian Martyrs, Jesuits who were killed during Iroquois warfare against the Huron around Georgian Bay in the 17th century. The Bay appears on maps of the time as \\"Toronto Bay\\". Penetanguishene, the location of an Ojibwe village located at the southern tip of the bay near present-day Midland, was developed as a naval base in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. In 1814, during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States, one of the battles was fought in southern Georgian Bay. On August 17, at the mouth of the Nottawasaga River near Wasaga Beach, the British schooner HMS Nancy was sunk by three American vessels. Several weeks later, Nancy was avenged when British boarding parties in the De Tour Passage surprised and captured two of the three American vessels. The first nautical charts of Georgian Bay were made in 1815 by Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen, who called it Lake Manitoulin. Captain Henry Bayfield, who made more detailed charts of the bay, renamed it in 1822 after King George IV. His charts are the basis for those in use today. The Canadian Hydrographic Service traces its history back to 1883, when it was originally established as the Georgian Bay Survey, tasked with charting and improving knowledge of the bay after a steamship wrecked there the previous year, killing 150 of its passengers. Over the years, 32 lighthouses were built on Georgian Bay. Six of them were designed with limestone towers; these were built in the 1850s and are known collectively as the Imperial Towers. Some of the 32 can be toured by the public, some cannot, and some are accessible only by tour boats or private boat. Legend of Kitchikewana The waters between Finger Point and Thumb Point near Cedar Springs, Beausoleil Island Wyandot legend tells of a god called Kitchikewana, who was large enough to guard the whole of the Georgian Bay. Kitchikewana was known for his great temper, and his tribe decided the best way to calm him was with a wife. They held a grand celebration, and many women came. Kitchikewana met a woman named Wanakita here. He decided that this was the woman he wanted to marry, and started planning the wedding immediately after she left. But when she was invited back, she told Kitchikewana that she was already engaged. Enraged, Kitchikewana destroyed all the decorations, running to one end of Beausoleil Island and grabbing a large ball of earth. Running to the other end, he tossed it into the Great Lakes. Thus, the 30,000 Islands were created. The indentations left behind by his fingers form the five bays of Georgian Bay: Midland Bay, Penetang Bay, Hog Bay, Sturgeon Bay, and Matchedash Bay.The Ouendat (Huron) Indian Legend of Kitchikewana He then lay down to sleep and sleeps there still as Giant's Tomb Island. The town of Penetanguishene now has a large statue of Kitchikewana on its main street. There is a YMCA summer camp for youth located on Beausoleil Island, in southern Georgian Bay, named after Kitchikewana.\\"Overnight Camp\\" on the YMCA of Simcoe/Muskoka website YMCA Camp Kitchikewana, or Kitchi for short, has been located in Georgian Bay Islands National Park since 1919. Originally operated by the Midland YMCA, it is now the residential camp for youth from the YMCA of Simcoe/Muskoka. Settlements Shoreline of Georgian Bay Sunset over Georgian Bay Collingwood has now passed Owen Sound as the largest city on the bay. http://population.city/canada/collingwood/ Owen Sound long having served as a shipping and rail depot for the Upper Great Lakes. The towns of Midland, Penetanguishene, Port Severn, and Honey Harbour are at the southeastern end of the bay and are popular sites for summer cottages, as are the many bays and islands on the eastern coast. Collingwood, Meaford, and Wasaga Beach are located at the southern end of the bay, around Nottawasaga Bay. Owen Sound, Wiarton, and Lion's Head are located on the Bruce Peninsula along the southern and southwestern shores of the bay, while Tobermory is located at the northern tip of the Bruce Peninsula on the Main Channel. The passenger ferry travels from Tobermory across the Main Channel to South Baymouth on Manitoulin Island. Port McNicoll, the world's deepest freshwater port, is located on the eastern shore of the bay. There are communities of summer cottages on the north and east shore and on the adjacent 30,000 Islands. These include areas such as Cognashene, Wah Wah Taysee, Sans Souci, Pointe au Baril and Byng Inlet. Most of these cottages are accessible only by water.

Of the so- called companions of William of Normandy, Malet is one of about a dozen for whom there is evidence of their presence at the Battle of Hastings. For example, the contemporary chronicler William of Poitiers recorded that Malet was present at the battle. According to apocryphal accounts, Malet was related to both William of Normandy and King Harold of England. Some accounts claim that Malet took charge of Harold's body following the Norman victory at Hastings. However, there is no evidence confirming such claims. Malet held substantial property in Normandy ‚Äì chiefly in the Pays de Caux, with a castle at (now a suburb of Le Havre). After 1066, he held many properties in England as well, most of them in Yorkshire and East Anglia. Biography =Early life= According to unverifiable, apocryphal accounts, Malet had significant, multiple ties to the Anglo-Saxon elite before the Norman Conquest. * Malet's mother was said to be English. * He was said to be the brother of Aelgifu, wife of √Ülfgar, Earl of Mercia (and, therefore, daughter-in-law of Lady Godiva). * In or about January 1066, King Harold married Ealdgyth, often known as Edith (the dowager of Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn) and a daughter of Aelgifu and √Ülfgar of Mercia. If Malet was a biological uncle of the queen consort of England in 1066, he would probably have been pivotal to Norman- English relations at around the time of the Battle of Hastings. =Battle of Hastings= There is evidence that Malet fought on the Norman side at Hastings, regardless of any divided loyalties that may have been caused by family ties. For instance, William of Poitiers wrote of King Harold's remains: \\"His corpse was brought into the Duke's camp and William [of Normandy] gave it for burial to William, surnamed Malet, and not to Harold's mother, who offered for the body of her beloved son its weight in gold.\\"Wm. of Poitiers, Gesta Guillelmi II Ducis Normannorum, quoted in David C.Douglas & George W. Greenaway (Eds.), English Historical Documents 1042‚Äì1189, London, 1959, p.229. If Malet was at the Norman headquarters, immediately after the battle, it would be strong evidence that he played a significant role in the Norman victory. =High Sheriff= Malet's activities during the first few years of the Norman conquest of England are not known. Early on he was granted the great honour of Eye, with vast lands in Suffolk and several other shires. It was in fact the largest lordship in East Anglia. He made Eye his caput, his main headquarters, built a motte and bailey castle there, and started a highly successful market. He is credited with initiating the urbanization of Eye. After the Danish stronghold York was captured in 1068, he was appointed the first High Sheriff of Yorkshire. William was in charge of the garrisons defending the shire and built a timbered castle fortress on a motte in York and another wooden castle across the River Ouse. His efforts at defending the shire from Danish raids were, in the end, a terrible failure, for the next year the city was burned and the garrison slaughtered. Malet, his wife, and two of their children were held as hostages, and finally released when the Danes were driven off. Malet was relieved of his duties in the north, but his efforts to defend the kingdom did not go unappreciated. He stayed in the king's favour and was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk about 1069/70, and appointment that passed to his son Robert upon his death. In historical literature & the media The Domesday Book also mentions a Durand Malet, who held land in LincolnshireDomesday Book and possibly some neighbouring shires. This may be William Malet's brother, but this is not certain. On screen, Malet has been portrayed by Peter Halliday in the two-part BBC TV play Conquest (1966), part of the series Theatre 625, and by Gawn Grainger in the TV drama Blood Royal: William the Conqueror (1990). Family While still in Normandy, about 1050, William married Hesilia (Helise or Elisee), daughter of Gilbert de Brionne. Hesilia was the second cousin of William the Conqueror and possibly the widow of Balderic Teutonicus (Balderic de Courcy; Balderic de Bacqueville).. William and Hesilia had two or more children: *Robert Malet (c. 1050 ‚Äì by 1130) *Gilbert Malet, founder of the Malets of Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Death William Malet died around 1071, probably during the rebellion of Hereward the Wake. He was succeeded by his son Robert as Lord of Eye and Sheriff of Suffolk.

Life He was born at Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire, England, son of Dr. John Aikin, Unitarian divine, and received his elementary education at the Nonconformist academy at Warrington, where his father was a tutor. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and in London under Dr. William Hunter. He practised as a surgeon at Chester and Warrington. Finally, he went to Leiden in Holland, earned an M.D. (1780), and in 1784 established himself as a doctor in Great Yarmouth. In 1792, one of his pamphlets having given offence, he moved to London, where he practised as a consulting physician. However, he concerned himself more with the advocacy of liberty of conscience than with his professional duties, and he began at an early period to devote himself to literary pursuits, to which his contributions were incessant. When Richard Phillips founded The Monthly Magazine in 1796, Aikin was its first editor. In conjunction with his sister, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, he published a popular series of volumes entitled Evenings at Home (6 vols, 1792‚Äì1795), for elementary family reading, which were translated into almost every European language. Works In 1798 Aikin retired from medicine and devoted himself with great industry to various literary undertakings, among which his General Biography (10 vols, 1799‚Äì1815) holds a conspicuous place. His other works included Biographical Memoirs of Medicine in Great Britain (1780) and The Lives of John Selden, Esq., and Archbishop Usher (1812). Aside from editing The Monthly Magazine from 1796 to 1807 and Dodsley's Annual Register from 1811 to 1815, he produced a paper called The Athenaeum 1807 to 1809, not to be confused with The Athenaeum, a well-known British magazine published from 1828 to 1921. Family Aikin had four children, three sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Arthur, was a prominent scientist, and the youngest, Edmund, an architect. The second son, Charles, was adopted by Aikin's sister, who had no children of her own. Through Charles, Aikin was grandfather to the writer Anna Letitia Le Breton. His daughter Lucy was a biographer, who in 1823 published her Memoir of John Aikin, M.D., with a selection of Miscellaneous Pieces, Biographical, Moral and Critical.

Lands were opened and sold first-come or by bid, or won by lottery, or by means other than a run. The settlers, no matter how they acquired occupancy, purchased the land from the United States Land Office. For former Indian lands, the Land Office distributed the sales funds to the various tribal entities, according to previously negotiated terms. The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 was the most prominent of the land runs while the Land Run of 1893 was the largest. The opening of the former Kickapoo area in 1895 was the last use of a land run in the present area of Oklahoma. In Oklahoma After years of raids‚Äîled by the leaders of the Boomers activist movement such as David L. Payne‚Äîinto the central area of what would become the U.S. state of Oklahoma, Congress finally agreed to open what was dubbed the Unassigned Lands. Seven land runs in all took place in Oklahoma, beginning with the initial and most famous Land Rush of April 22, 1889, which gave rise to the terms \\"Eighty-Niner\\" (a veteran of that run) and \\"Sooner.\\" That area led to today's Canadian, Cleveland, Kingfisher, Logan, Oklahoma, and Payne counties of Oklahoma. The nearly two million acres of land opened up to white settlement was located in Indian Territory, a large area that once encompassed much of modern-day Oklahoma. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 eventually led to the Trail of Tears. Creek and Seminole tribes were granted area known before the Land Run as the Unassigned Lands. Some American Indian tribes signed a treaty of alliance with the Confederacy in 1861. Initially considered unsuitable for white colonization, Indian Territory was thought to be an ideal place to relocate Native Americans who were removed from their traditional lands to make way for white settlement. The relocations began in 1817, and by the 1880s, Indian Territory was a new home to a variety of tribes, including the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Cheyenne, Commanche, and Apache. The Land Run of September 22, 1891, opened the Iowa, Sac and Fox, Potawatomi, and Shawnee lands to settlement. The land run opened 6,097 plots of each of former reservation land.Oklahoma Land Run Openings 1889-1907 (accessed October 6, 2013). On the following day, a land run was held to settle Tecumseh, the pre-designated location of the county seat of County B, later renamed as Pottawatomie County. On September 28, 1891, another land run was held to settle Chandler, the pre- designated location of the county seat of County A, later renamed as Lincoln County. The Land Run of April 19, 1892, opened the Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. The Land Run of September 16, 1893 was known as the Cherokee Strip Land Run. It opened 8,144,682.91 acres (12,726 square miles or about 3.3 million hectares) to settlement. The land was purchased from the Cherokees. It was the largest land run in U.S. history, four times larger than the Land Rush of 1889.Green, Donald E., \\"Settlement Patterns,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, 2009. Accessed March 1, 2015. The Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center museum at the eastern edge of Enid, Oklahoma commemorates this event. The final land run in Oklahoma was the Land Run of 1895 to settle the Kickapoo lands. Each run had exhibited many problems and the Federal Government deemed the run to be an inefficient way to distribute land to would-be settlers. After 1895, the government distributed land by sealed-bid auctions. Major openings by this method included Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation (1901), the Wichita-Caddo Reservation (1901), and the Big Pasture (1906).Everett, Dianna. \\"Land Openings.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed July 22, 2016. There was one land run in the 20th Century, but on a much smaller scale, held to select lots in the community of Arcadia, on August 6, 1901.

His most important discovery was made while using an experimental strategy known as a pulse-chase analysis. In the experiment Palade and his colleagues were able to confirm an existing hypothesis that a secretory pathway exists and that the Rough ER and the Golgi apparatus function together.

Later, it was subsequently extended to the West Coast in Oregon. When the U.S. highway system was first defined, it was limited to Nebraska and Wyoming; by the 1950s, it continued into Idaho and Oregon. The highway's eastern terminus is in Ogallala, Nebraska at an intersection with Interstate 80. Its western terminus is south of Seaside, Oregon at an intersection with U.S. Route 101. Prior to 2004, the route's last 20 miles (32 km) were co- signed with U.S. Route 101 from the highways' junction south of Seaside north to Astoria where its intersection with U.S. Route 30 was also U.S. 30's western terminus. Long segments of the highway follow the historic Oregon Trail. At its peak, immediately before the establishment of the interstate highway system, US 26 was 1,557 miles (2506 km) in length, and terminated in Astoria, Oregon. Route description =Oregon= US 26 at the entrance to Picture Gorge in Eastern Oregon. The John Day River is to the right of the roadway. Start of US 26 in Oregon Starting at a junction with U.S. Highway 101 near Seaside, Oregon, U.S. Highway 26 heads southeast through the Coast Range to Portland. In the western Portland area, US 26 is a freeway known as the Sunset Highway. After passing through the Vista Ridge Tunnel, heading into downtown Portland, it intersects with Interstate 405 and runs along the interstate southbound for about a half-mile before exiting onto surface streets at the waterfront, meeting Oregon Route 43 at Macadam Avenue before crossing Interstate 5. After crossing the Willamette River and meeting at an incomplete interchange with Oregon Route 99E, US26 then heads east on Powell Boulevard where it crosses Interstate 205 and continues east to Sandy on what is known as the Mount Hood Highway No. 26 (see Oregon Routes and Highways), a four-lane divided highway that was supposed to be the Mount Hood Freeway, which was never built just south of Division St. After passing through Sandy, Highway 26 (known there as the Mount Hood Highway) continues on towards Government Camp and Bennett Pass, where it eventually meets up with Oregon Route 35. The Mount Hood Highway continues north along Oregon Route 35, while Highway 26 heads southeast towards Madras, where it intersects with U.S. Route 97. It then continues southeast to Prineville, where it meets Oregon Route 126 and heads east through John Day where it meets U.S. Route 20 in Vale. The remainder of Highway 26 follows U.S. Route 20 to the Idaho state line. =Idaho= From the Oregon state line, US 26 continues to follow US 20 to Boise, with short multiplexes with U.S. Highway 95 near Parma and Interstate 84 at Caldwell. At Boise, US 26/US 20 merges with I-84 for about 40 miles until Mountain Home, where US 20 splits from US 26/I-84. About 41 miles later in Bliss, US 26 splits from I-84, joining US 93 at Shoshone with the concurrent routes joining US 20 at Carey. US 26/20/93 skirt the north edge of Craters of the Moon National Monument and then through Arco where US 93 splits north. Near Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, US. 26 again splits from US 20 to the southeast, proceeding to Blackfoot, where US 26 joins Interstate 15 for about 20 miles before splitting just south of Idaho Falls toward Alpine, Wyoming. =Wyoming= US 20/26 at the entrance to Hell's Half Acre (Wyoming). From Alpine, US 26 is co-signed with U.S. Route 89 east and north to Hoback Junction, then co-signed with US 89, U.S. Route 189, and U.S. Route 191 to Jackson. US 189 ends in Jackson, and the other three highways continue their concurrency through Grand Teton National Park up to Moran. At \\"Glacier View Turnout,\\" a view of Teton Glacier, on the north of Grand Teton, can be seen. At Moran, US 26 turns east, concurrent with U.S. Route 287. Crossing the Continental Divide at Togwotee Pass, US 26 passes through Dubois, Wyoming, the end of the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway, and at Diversion Dam Junction, US 26 and US 287 separate; US 26 continues southeast to Riverton, then northeast to Shoshoni. From Shoshoni to Casper, US 26 is co-signed with U.S. Highway 20. US 20-26 has a bypass north of Casper, the eastern half of which is concurrent with Interstate 25 and U.S. Route 87. US 20-26-87 parallels I-25 from Casper to Glenrock; east of Glenrock, US 26 (along with US 20 and US 87) is co-signed on I-25. US 26 follows I-25 to Dwyer Junction, where it turns east to continue along the Old Oregon Trail. US 26 passes through Guernsey, Fort Laramie, Lingle, and Torrington before entering Nebraska. U.S. Route 85 is concurrent with US 26 between Lingle and Torrington. =Nebraska= US 26 runs southeastward parallel to the North Platte River. The largest city US 26 runs through in Nebraska is Scottsbluff, which is just 22 miles (35 km) from the Wyoming border. US 26 also goes past the Chimney Rock National Historic Site. US 26 intersects with U.S. Highway 385 in Bridgeport and then continues to its eastern terminus in Ogallala, Nebraska at Interstate 80. All told, there are 145 miles (233 km) of US 26 in the state of Nebraska. History U.S. Highway 320 (US 320) was part of the initial 1926 system, connecting US 20 in Shoshoni with US 87W in Riverton, Wyoming. It became WYO 320 in 1938, which was extended southwest to Lander in 1940 when US 287 (which had replaced US 87W) was realigned. The original part of US 320/WYO 320 became part of an extension of US 26 in 1950, and the rest of WYO 320 became part of WYO 789 in 1954.Wyoming @ AARoads.com - U.S. Highway 320 (Decommissioned) Major intersections ;Oregon : south of Seaside : in Portland.

In most designs, logic gates are connected to form more complex circuits. While no logic gate input can be fed by more than one output at a time without causing contention, it is common for one output to be connected to several inputs. The technology used to implement logic gates usually allows a certain number of gate inputs to be wired directly together without additional interfacing circuitry. The maximum fan- out of an output measures its load-driving capability: it is the greatest number of inputs of gates of the same type to which the output can be safely connected.  Logical practice  Maximum limits on fan-out are usually stated for a given logic family or device in the manufacturer's datasheets. These limits assume that the driven devices are members of the same family. More complex analysis than fan-in and fan-out is required when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately determined by the maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the driving device must be able to supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a \\"standard\\" input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a \\"standard\\" device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree. When high-speed signal switching is required, the AC impedance of the output, the inputs, and the conductors between may significantly reduce the effective drive capacity of output, and this DC analysis may not be enough. See AC Fan-out below.  Theory  =DC fan-out= A perfect logic gate would have infinite input impedance and zero output impedance, allowing a gate output to drive any number of gate inputs. However, since real-world fabrication technologies exhibit less than perfect characteristics, a limit will be reached where a gate output cannot drive any more current into subsequent gate inputs - attempting to do so causes the voltage to fall below the level defined for the logic level on that wire, causing errors. The fan- out is simply the number of inputs that can be connected to an output before the current required by the inputs exceeds the current that can be delivered by the output while still maintaining correct logic levels. The current figures may be different for the logic zero and logic one states and in that case we must take the pair that give the lower fan-out. This can be expressed mathematically as :\\\\text{DC Fan-out} = \\\\operatorname{min}\\\\left ( \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{I_{\\\\text{out high}}}{I_{\\\\text{in high}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor ,\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{I_{\\\\text{out low}}}{I_{\\\\text{in low}}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\right ) (\\\\lfloor\\\\;\\\\rfloor is the floor function). Going on these figures alone TTL logic gates are limited to perhaps 2 to 10, depending on the type of gate, while CMOS gates have DC fan-outs that are generally far higher than is likely to occur in practical circuits (e.g. using NXP Semiconductor specifications for their HEF4000 series CMOS chips at 25 ¬∞C and 15 V gives a fan-out of 34 000). =AC fan-out= However, inputs of real gates have capacitance as well as resistance to the power supply rails. This capacitance will slow the output transition of the previous gate and hence increase its propagation delay. As a result, rather than a fixed fan-out the designer is faced with a trade off between fan-out and propagation delay (which affects the maximum speed of the overall system). This effect is less marked for TTL systems, which is one reason why TTL maintained a speed advantage over CMOS for many years. Often a single signal (as an extreme example, the clock signal) needs to drive far more than 10 things on a chip. Rather than simply wiring the output of a gate to 1000 different inputs, circuit designers have found that it runs much faster to have a tree (as an extreme example, a clock tree) ‚Äì for example, have the output of that gate drive 10 buffers (or equivalently a buffer scaled 10 times as big as the minimum-size buffer), those buffers drive 100 other buffers (or equivalently a buffer scaled 100 times as big as the minimum-size buffer), and those final buffers to drive the 1000 desired inputs. During physical design, some VLSI design tools do buffer insertion as part of signal integrity design closure. Likewise, rather than simply wiring all 64 output bits to a single 64-input NOR gate to generate the Z flag on a 64-bit ALU, circuit designers have found that it runs much faster to have a tree ‚Äì for example, have the Z flag generated by an 8-input NOR gate, and each of their inputs generated by an 8-input OR gate. Reminiscent of radix economy, one estimate for the total delay of such a tree‚Äîthe total number of stages by the delay of each stage ‚Äì gives an optimum (minimum delay) when each stage of the tree is scaled by e, approximately 2.7. People who design digital integrated circuits typically insert trees whenever necessary such that the fan-in and fan-out of each and every gate on the chip is between 2 and 10.Miles Murdocca, Apostolos Gerasoulis, and Saul Levy. \\"Novel Optical Computer Architecture Utilizing Reconfigurable Interconnects\\". 1991. p. 60-61. Dynamic or AC fan- out, not DC fan-out is therefore the primary limiting factor in many practical cases, due to the speed limitation. For example, suppose a microcontroller has 3 devices on its address and data lines, and the microcontroller can drive 35 pF of bus capacitance at its maximum clock speed. If each device has 8 pF of input capacitance, then only 11 pF of trace capacitance is allowable. (Routing traces on printed circuit boards usually have 1-2 pF per inch so the traces in this case can be 5.5 inches long max.) If this trace length condition can't be met, then the microcontroller must be run at a slower bus speed for reliable operation, or a buffer chip with higher current drive must be inserted into the circuit. Higher current drive increases speed since \\\\textstyle\\\\ I = C\\\\frac{dV}{dt}; more simply, current is rate of flow of charge, so increased current charges the capacitance faster, and the voltage across a capacitor is equal to the charge on it divided by the capacitance. So with more current, voltage changes faster, which allows faster signaling over the bus. Unfortunately, due to the higher speeds of modern devices, IBIS simulations may be required for exact determination of the dynamic fan-out since dynamic fan-out is not clearly defined in most datasheets.

Its original name was Daecheong Hwangje Gongdeok Bi (Â§ßÊ∑∏ÁöáÂ∏ùÂäüÂæ∑Á¢ë), which means the stele to the merits and virtues of the Emperor of Great Qing. Initially erected at Samjeondo, near the Sambatnaru crossing point of the Han River, it was thereafter buried and erected again several times. It is nowadays designated as the 101st Historic site of South Korea. Erection Following the siege of Namhansanseong, King Injo of Joseon had to surrender and was forced to accept vassal status to the Manchu Empire in 1636. The following year, Hong Taiji, Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, ordered King Injo to put up a monument \\"in honor of the excellent virtues of the Qing Emperor\\". In 1639 it was erected at Samjeondo, where the ceremony of surrender had been conducted. Inscriptions were written in Manchu and Mongolian on the front side and in Classical Chinese on the back; they have almost identical contents. The Classical Chinese version was composed by Yi Gyeongseok (ÊùéÊôØÂ•≠), and the rest seem to have been translated from it. Samjeondo, meaning \\"crossing of the three fields\\", was located near the Sambatnaru, a major crossing point of the Han River in early Joseon times. The Sambatnaru way was the shortest route to the stronghold of Gwangju and the southern provinces. It was also the one most often used to visit the tomb of King Taejong at the foot of Mt. Daemosan. Timeline Because of the strong emotional charge attached to it, this monument has been buried and then erected again several times from 1639 till nowadays. * 1895.

As a result, it greatly flattered the Manchus; namely, the inscription narrates how the king of Korea came to attach himself to the virtue of the Manchu Emperor from a Korean point of view. Although one- sided, it provides a concise account of the Manchu-Korean relationship. The inscription starts with the description of the second Manchu campaign against Korea in 1636. The Manchu army besieged the Namhan fortress, where King Injo took refuge. He admitted his guilt, accepted the imperial edict and surrendered at Samjeondo. Since Hong Taiji felt compassion for the king, he mercifully sent the king back to the capital and rapidly withdrew the army without doing harm to the people. In the next paragraph, the inscription traces the history back to the Battle of Sarh≈´ in 1619. The Korean army, led by Gang Hong-rip, put on the appearance of supporting the Ming Dynasty but surrendered to the Manchus. However, all of the soldiers except the high- ranking ones were released by Nurhaci, and the inscription emphasizes the merciful act. Since Korea still displayed disobedient behavior, Hong Taiji commenced the first Manchu invasion of Korea in 1627. He did not overthrow the kingdom but established a Confucian \\"elder brother-younger brother\\" relationship. The inscription then goes on to describe the second Manchu campaign. When Hong Taiji declared the new dynasty of Qing in 1636, Korea did not accept it even though the Empire announced a war. The inscription stressed his benevolent acts during the war. Next, the inscription explains the background of erection of the monument. It says that the king voluntarily erected the monument at Samjeondo to let the excellent virtue of the Emperor be known around the world. Finally, the inscription summarizes the entire course of events in verse.

It was discovered by Edward R. Ayrton in 1907 while he was working in the Valley for Theodore M. Davis. It has long been speculated, as well as much-disputed, that the body found in this tomb was that of the famous king, Akhenaten, who moved the capital to Akhetaten (modern day Amarna). The results of genetic and other scientific tests published in February 2010 have confirmed that the person buried there was both the son of Amenhotep III as well as the father of Tutankhamun. Furthermore, the study established that the age of this person at the time of his death was consistent with that of Akhenaten, thereby making it almost certain that it is Akhenaten's body.Hawass, Zahi et al. \\"Ancestry and Pathology in King Tutankhamun's Family\\" The Journal of the American Medical Association (2010) p.644 However, a growing body of work soon began to appear to dispute the assessment of the age of the mummy and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten.Strouhal, E. \\"Biological age of skeletonized mummy from Tomb KV 55 at Thebes\\" in Anthropologie: International Journal of the Science of Man Vol 48 Issue 2 (2010), pp 97‚Äì112. Dr. Strouhal examined KV55 in 1998, but the results were apparently delayed and perhaps eclipsed by Filer's examination in 2000. Strouhal's findings were published in 2010 to dispute the Hawass et al conclusions.

It is presumed to be a royal cache and reburial dating from the late eighteenth dynasty, prepared after the abandonment of Amarna and the dismantling of the royal necropolis there. On the basis of the recovered artifacts, it is also suggested that the burial once contained more than a single occupant, either interred on one occasion or over a period of time. Queen Tiye is most often named in this context. It is also clear that the tomb was re-entered at a later time, almost certainly during the twentieth dynasty. At that time, any additional, hypothetical occupants of the tomb would have been removed and (possibly) relocated to KV35, while the remaining mummy and some of the other artefacts were desecrated and abandoned. The tomb is often referred to as the \\"Amarna cache\\", given the mixed nature of its contents. Discovery and excavations The entrance to KV55 was uncovered by Ayrton on 6 January 1907. Its discovery was brought to Davis's attention on the following day. The tomb was first entered on 9 January by Ayrton, Davis, Joseph Lindon Smith, and (as the representative of the antiquities service) Arthur Weigall. On 11 January 1907, the finds were photographed.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications. 1990), p.v Ayrton then began clearance of the tomb. On 25 January 1907, the coffin and mummy were investigated in situ.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications. 1990), p.vii. According to a letter from Davis to Gaston Maspero, some of the objects found in KV55 were still in place in January 1908, and their study and attempts at conservation were still ongoing at this later date.Reeves, C.N., Valley of the Kings, (Keegan Paul, 1990), p . 335-336 In 1921, while excavating south of the tomb, Howard Carter discovered several items that seem to have originated in KV55. These include a jasper burnisher and some fragments of copper rosettes from a funerary pall.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications. 1990), p.ix. After its excavation, the tomb's entrance was initially fitted with a steel door, which was later removed and replaced by stone blocking. By 1944, this blocking had collapsed and filled the tomb's entrance with debris. In 1993, the tomb was cleared again by Lyla Pinch Brock. In 1996, she undertook conservation work on the stairs and the plastering inside the burial chamber through a grant from the American Research Centre in Egypt. =KVC= Three days before the discovery of KV55, Ayrton uncovered a recess in the rock (now designated as KVC) located immediately above the entrance to KV55 and containing jars of twentieth dynasty type.Davis (1990), p.v. This recess may have been an unfinished tomb commencement, and its contents may be analogous to the embalming cache found in KV54, but because the find was never properly published, the precise nature of its contents, the date of the jars, and its relation (if any) to KV55 are now unclear.Reeves (1990), p.172Bell (1990) p. 137 The tomb =Location and general appearance= Tomb layout of KV55 A ‚Äì Entrance B ‚Äì Corridor J ‚Äì Burial chamber Ja ‚Äì (unfinished) Ante-chamber KV55 is a relatively small, undecorated, single-chamber tomb, its total length measuring only 27.61 meters. It is located in the central area of the valley, immediately adjacent to and below KV 6 (Ramesses IX) and across the valley floor from KV7 (Ramesses II) and the near-contemporary tomb KV62 (Tutankhamun). Oriented almost due east, its entrance way consists of a set of stairs cut into the valley bedrock that leads to a gently sloping corridor and then to the single chamber of the tomb. The tomb appears to be unfinished: in the south wall of the burial chamber is a small niche, the commencement of an unfinished antechamber, while red masonry marks within the burial chamber indicate plans for yet another room. When finished these would have made the tomb's layout roughly similar to that of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Such a plan seems to indicate that KV55, like KV62, was initially intended as a private burial site and only later taken over for a royal interment.Reeves, N., Wilkinson, R.H., The Complete Valley of the Kings, (Thames & Hudson. 1997), p.121 =Entranceway= The tomb is accessed by a flight of 20 steps, cut into the bedrock and covered by an overhanging rock. An ostracon found by Pinch Brock in 1993 has been interpreted as a plan of the tomb, and possibly indicates a widening of the entrance after its initial cutting. This possibility is also suggested by mason's marks found on the walls by the tomb entrance. It appears that the stairwell has been enlarged, its ceiling raised, and the number of steps increased. When the tomb was discovered in 1907, the stairwell was covered with debris, probably originating from the cutting of KV 6 directly above. The upper layer of this filling consisted of chips cemented together by water; underneath, the chips were dry and clean.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p.7. =Doorway and blocking= When it was discovered, the tomb's outer door was blocked by two consecutive walls. The primary blocking consisted of a wall of cemented limestone blocks, plastered and stamped with the seal of the Royal Necropolis (with the jackal and nine captives motif).Reeves, C.N., Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 42 Weigall later stated that a fragment of Tutankhamun's seal had been recovered from this original blocking.Weigall, A.E.P.B., The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (Rand McNally and Company, 1912) p.208 However, his statement is not corroborated by any of the other reports dating from the initial discovery, leaving Weigall's claim open to question.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p.vi.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 136 The first wall had been partially pulled down in antiquity, and the tomb was closed again by a second wall made of loose limestone fragments, erected in front of the remains of the first wall. Because Weigall described these consecutive blockings in ambiguous terms, it is unclear whether the secondary wall was found intact or had already been partially dismantled, like the primary wall.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 133 =Corridor= The sloping corridor beyond the entrance was partially filled with rubble. Since the secondary wall was built on top of material originating from this rubble, the fill seems to date from the time of the original interment. By 1907 this rubble had spread down into the burial chamber. Stains on the ceiling and walls of the corridor indicate that water had infiltrated the tomb in the past. On top of the rubble fill were found a panel and door of a large gilded shrine, although the exact position of these items is unclear.Reeves, C.N., Valley of the Kings, (Keegan Paul, 1990), p. 45, fig 17Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 110, p. 116 and fig. 5 Additional pieces of the same shrine were recovered from the burial chamber. One of the four Egyptian alabaster canopic jars found in KV55, depicting what is thought to be the likeness of Queen Kiya =Burial chamber and niche= The walls of the burial chamber were plastered, but otherwise undecorated. This plastering seems to have been done some years after the cutting of the tomb, and repairs are evident. Rubble fill from the corridor had spread down into the chamber, partially covering its floor with debris. Elsewhere in the burial chamber, the floor and numerous objects were covered with fragments of plaster fallen from the walls and stones fallen from the ceiling.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 116 Items found in the burial chamber can be grouped into several categories:Reeves, C.N., Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990) p.46-47Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 110-119 *Parts of a dismantled, gilded shrine: Related to the panel and door found in the corridor. A door was found lying on the rubble inflow near the entrance to the chamber; large panels were lying on the floor or stacked against the eastern wall; and smaller elements (such as doorjambs, a lintel, and possibly parts of the cornice) were lying on the floor. *Coffin, mummy, and related items: Lying against the southern wall and resting on the decayed remains of a lion-headed bier was a badly damaged coffin. Its lid was ajar, and the coffin box had rotted. The mummy contained in this coffin was badly preserved but its linen wrappings appear to have been intact. The damaged skull had been separated from the body and was found with a vulture pectoral wrapped around it. The left arm of the body was crossed over the chest, the right arm extended. In the niche above this coffin was found a set of four canopic jars. Also related to this group of items were four \\"magical bricks\\". *Remains of boxes and their contents: At least two badly preserved boxes were found in the south-eastern corner of the room, their contents spread on the floor. These included faience objects and appear to have been related to the \\"Opening of the Mouth\\" ceremony. *Seal impressions: Several small seal impressions were found underneath the panels of the gilded shrine. These carry Tutankhamun's prenomen and are identical to seal type N found in Tutankhamun's own tomb. *Other items: Their exact location in the chamber is not always clear. Included are a vase stand, fragment of furniture, a silver head of a goose, pall-discs of gilded copper, and a statue plinth. Some wooden objects in the burial chamber seem to have suffered water damage, most notably the coffin, bier, and boxes; however, the elements of the gilded shrine appear to have been reasonably solid.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p.132 Moisture is also the likely cause of the discoloration visible on some of the faience objects, although other, similar objects appear unaffected. Isometric, plan, and elevation images of KV55 taken from a 3-D model Interpretation The problems surrounding the interpretation of KV55 are due in large part to the shortcomings of Davis's original publication of the excavation. Its mix of fact, assumption, error, and omission has obscured a full understanding of the deposit ever since.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi (KMT Communications. 1990), p. iv The blame for these shortcomings usually falls on Davis (as editor of the publication) and Ayrton (as supervising archaeologist).Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 97 Recent careful re-examinationsReeves, C.N., The Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 42-49Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) of the original publication, of eyewitness reports, and of the photographs taken before the tomb was cleared have brought some clarity to the situation. Although the tomb was clearly disturbed in antiquity and its contents have been described as disordered and chaotic,Reeves, C.N., The Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 43 Martha Bell argued that this disarray was more apparent than real. Her reconstruction of the layout of the tomb indicates an orderly and deliberate arrangement of artefacts, and she suggests that the impression of chaos might be due to the collapse of wooden objects caused by falling plaster and stone. The \\"cemented\\" chips and stains in the corridor indicate that water entered the tomb along the corridor ceiling, but the amount of water might not have been great, and most damage could have been caused by increased humidity rather than direct contact with water. Bell also suggested that the moisture under the mummy might have resulted from rainfall shortly after the tomb's opening in 1907. Other damage to wooden objects might result from an insect attack. =The shrine and Tiye's burial= A recent reconstruction of the shrine,Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 127 and following based on photographic evidence, drawings, eyewitness descriptions, and two surviving planks on display in Cairo, indicate that it resembled Tutankhamun's second and third shrines in general appearance and size. The presence of copper rosettes indicate that a funeral pall was draped on a frame associated with the shrine, also comparable to Tutankhamun's shrines.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 129 However, the decoration and inscriptions on the shrine are markedly different from those of Tutankhamun: the decoration was dominated by large offering scenes rather than a multitude of smaller mythological scenes; the text was far more brief, and seems primarily concerned with titles, names, and the shrine's dedication, rather than with excerpts from funerary books; and the interior of the shrine was uninscribed and undecorated.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 120, 129 The text on the shrine states that it was made by Akhenaten for his mother Tiye. With one exception, the names of Akhenaten were erased and in some places were replaced by those of Amenhotep III (the father of Akhenaten) in ink. The text also refers to the \\"House of the Aten in Akhetaten\\", perhaps indicating that the shrine was made and originally used in Amarna. The decoration, which appears to have been very similar on all sides of the shrine, features Akhenaten and Tiye making offerings to the Aten, with a focus on the king rather than his mother. As with his names, Akhenaten's figure was erased from the scenes, with one exception.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 120-129 The orderly arrangement of the shrine parts inside the tomb seems to indicate that it once stood up, fully assembled, with its doors facing south, and that it was later dismantled inside the tomb.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 120 It appears that only a single shrine was used in KV55, rather than a suite of four nested shrines, as in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The presence of a shrine dedicated to Tiye is usually seen as evidence that Tiye's mummy once reposed inside the shrine in KV55. Other objects inscribed with her name (such as the piece of furniture) and with those of Amenhotep III are also seen as belonging to her funerary equipment. The seal impressions found near the east wall might indicate further items that were removed together with the queen's mummy at some later point.Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 135 =Coffin, canopic jars, and magical bricks= The desecrated royal coffin found in Tomb KV55 When KV55 was initially opened, Theodore Davis believed that he had found the tomb of Queen Tiye. However, it was quickly recognized that the human remains interred there were male. Georges Daressy further deduced that the gilded coffin found in the tomb was originally made for a woman and only later adapted to accommodate a king, through alterations to its inscriptions and the addition of a false beard, a uraeus, and the royal scepters (crook and flail).Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. viii The identity of the coffin's original owner has been a matter of much discussion over the years, with Tiye, Nefertiti, Meketaten, and Meritaten all proposed as candidates.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) pp. viii‚Äìx It is now widely accepted that the coffin was originally intended for Akhenaten's secondary wife Kiya.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. xii It is also recognized that the four canopic jars discovered near the coffin belonged to Kiya, and that the female heads on the stoppers of the jars portray her. Like the coffin, the canopic jars were altered for the burial of a king through the erasure of Kiya's titulary and the addition of a royal uraeus to each portrait head. All personal names inscribed on the coffin and the canopic jars were excised in antiquity, rendering the identity of the human remains inside the coffin a matter of long debate. Over the past century, the chief candidates for this individual have been either Akhenaten or Smenkhkare, another male member of the Amarna royal family.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. viii, p. xivAldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 205Gabolde, M., \\"Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky\\", Causing His Name to Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J. Murnane figs. 2‚Äì6 Evidence that the occupant of the coffin was Akhenaten is provided by the four magical bricks found inside the tomb. Two were inscribed in hieratic, but they are poorly preserved and the name of their owner is lost. The other two, however, are of better quality, with hieroglyphic inscriptions naming the Osiris Neferkheprure Waenre, a reference to Akhenaten's nomen.Reeves, C.N., The Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990), p. 58 The fact that all four bricks were orientated correctly and that three of them were positioned in close association with the coffin suggests that they were intended as a set and were made for the coffin's final occupant,Bell, M.R., \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990), p. 134 who therefore, would be Akhenaten. =The identification of the mummy= Profile view of the skull recovered from KV55 The mummy found in the tomb was however at first identified as belonging to a woman by two visiting physicians who examined the remains in situ. This led Davis to conclude he had found the mummy of queen Tiye and he therefore published his account of the discovery as The Tomb of Queen Tiyi. As possible reasons for this initial identification the (typical female) position of the mummy's arms,Reeves, C.N., The Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990) p.44-49 post- mortem damage to the pelvic bonesAldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 199 and the absence of male genitalia have been suggested. But when anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith examined the skull and bones in Cairo a few months later he concluded that they were those of a young male, with wide hips, a pendent chin, and distorted cranium brought on by chronic hydrocephalus. The age of death he estimated as being around 25 years although he later suggested the possibility that the body had suffered from Fr√∂lich's syndrome which delayed normal skeletal maturation. These results were seen to support the initial claims by Weigall, Maspero, and Smith, based on other evidence found in the tomb (see above) that the body was that of Akhenaten. Later re-examinations of the remains confirmed Smith's original identification of the mummy as belonging to a young male (although with feminine trends)Aldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 201 but pushed the estimated age of death back to around 20 years.Aldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 201-202 These re- examinations also indicated that the body showed no signs of delayed maturation,Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. xi and that, while the skull was of unusual shape, it certainly wasn't abnormal, and showed no indication of hydrocephalus. Reconstruction of the facial features of the skull also indicated that there was no resemblance with Akhenaten's representation on his monuments. It must be remembered though, that Akhenaten's representations are highly stylised. After the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun a close resemblance was noted between his mummy and the body found in KV55 and later tests showed both shared the same blood-group (A2) and serum antigen (MN), all of which suggests Tutankhamun and the individual found in KV55 were closely related to each other, either as father and son, or brothers. Based on these results it was concluded that the KV55 body was too young to be Akhenaten and they were seen to support the claim that the mummy was that of Smenkhkare, an idea first proposed by Rex Engelbach in 1931. Before February 2010, it was pointed out that the reliability of methods to assess the age of death for mummies in general was uncertain.Gabolde, M., Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky p. 14 and following For these reasons the correctness of the age estimates was repeatedly called into question.Aldred, C., Akhenaten, King of Egypt (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 202Reeves, C.N., The Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 49Gabolde, M., Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky p.16 Several studies estimated the mummy to be of a man who died around age 25‚Äì26; beside Smith, Douglas E. Derry and Ronald G. Harrison both came to this conclusion. John R. Harris in the late 1980s offered 35 years as its age, while Joyce Filer in the early 2000s suggested early 20s. Elsewhere, an analysis of the skeletal remains based on dentition and X-rays of the long bones indicated 35 years.Reeves, C.N, Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet (Thames and Hudson, 2001) p. 84Fletcher, Joann, The Search for Nefertiti (William Morrow, 2004) p.180 Finally, examinations using CT scans from the late 2000s, published in 2010 and 2016, showed the mummy to have died between age 35‚Äì45, which the examiners believe supports the theory that the mummy is Akhenaten's. The archaeological, inscriptional, and now genetic evidence indicate that the ancient Egyptians who buried (and later desecrated) the body in KV55 believed this to be Akhenaten's.Gabolde, M., Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky However, a number of experts dispute these findings, claiming that Hawass et al. have not provided sufficient evidence to assume the older age at death. Bickerstaffe, D. The King is dead. How Long Lived the King? in Kmt vol 22, n 2, Summer 2010. In fact, the original 2010 paper only cites a single point of spinal degeneration, while other analyses, such as Strouhal's cite multiple indicators for a younger age. Further complicating the identity of the KV55 mummy is the fact that he does not seem to be the father of the female mummy KV21a. The latter has been identified as a likely candidate for the mother of two foetuses found in Tutankhamun's tomb, thus probably making her Ankhesenamun, the daughter of Akhenaten and the only known wife of Tutankhamun. The identity of the KV55 mummy therefore, remains controversial for many. =Reconstruction= The Ancient Egyptian vulture pectoral found on the head of the mysterious king in tomb KV55 The deposit as it was found in KV55 presents a mixture of chronological and religious anomalies. Objects inscribed with Amenhotep III's nomen and prenomen might be contemporary with that king's reign and could be interpreted as possessions of Queen Tiye. Other items inscribed with Tiye's name (such as the shrine and furniture elements) also clearly belonged to her. Akhenaten's presence is indicated by items originally inscribed for him (such as the magical bricks) and items that were adapted for his use (such as the coffin and canopic jars). It is nevertheless highly unlikely that either of these two burials within KV55 was original. In the case of Tiye, evidence found in tomb WV22 suggests that Amenhotep III prepared her burial in his own tomb. However, the fact that Tiye outlived her husband by possibly as much as twelve years seems to have disrupted such plans. From inscriptional evidence on the KV55 shrine on the other hand, it seems likely that Tiye was buried at Amarna by her son Akhenaten. In the case of Akhenaten it seems almost certain that he was originally buried in the tomb he prepared for himself in the Amarna royal wadi. Although it is unclear whether or not the original blocking of the tomb was stamped with Tutankhamun's seal, the several small seal impressions carrying his prenomen are most likely related to the reburial(s) in KV55 since he was probably not involved in the original burial preparations of either Tiye (who died several years before Tutankhamun came to the throne) or Akhenaten (who presumably was buried by his co-regent and probable immediate successor Smenkhkare).Reeves, C.N., Valley of the Kings (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 44 One scenario, suggested by Nicholas Reeves, is as follows: Akhenaten and his mother, Queen Tiye, were originally entombed at Akhenaten's new capital Akhetaten (modern Amarna) but their mummies were moved to KV55 following the total abandonment of Akhetaten during the reign of Tutankhamun, who was Akhenaten's son. The door to KV55 was sealed with Tutankhamun's name. There the mummies remained for about 200 years, until the tomb was rediscovered by workmen excavating the tomb of Ramesses IX nearby. By this time, Akhenaten was reviled as the \\"heretic king\\"; consequently, Queen Tiye's sarcophagus was hastily removed from his defiling presence, except for its surrounding gilded wooden shrine, which would have had to be dismantled for removal. Akhenaten's likeness was chiseled off the shrine's carved relief. Moreover, the gold face mask was ripped from Akhenaten's sarcophagus and his identifying cartouche was removed from its hieroglyphic inscription, thus consigning its occupant to oblivion. As a final insult, a large rock was thrown at the coffin.Reeves, Nicholas. Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet. p.83. Thames & Hudson. 2005. However, a finely made vulture pectoral‚Äîa symbol of royalty in Ancient Egypt‚Äîwas still found placed around this mummy's head. Later use of KV55 In 1923, Harry Burton used KV55 as a darkroom to develop his photographs documenting Howard Carter's excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb.

As a Soviet double agent, he passed to the Soviet Union the raw Tunny decryptions that influenced the Battle of Kursk. He was alleged to be the fifth member of the Cambridge Five. He is also notable as a translator and writer of non- fiction. Childhood and education Cairncross' father was the manager of an ironmongery and his mother a primary school teacher. John Cairncross was one of a family of eight, many of whom had distinguished careers. All three of his brothers became professors. One was the economist Sir Alexander Kirkland Cairncross (a.k.a. Alec Cairncross). The journalist Frances Cairncross is his niece. Cairncross grew up in Lesmahagow, a small town on the edge of moorland, near Lanark in the Central Belt of Scotland, and was educated at the Hamilton Academy (although his name appears as the 1928 winner of the Dux prize at Lesmahagow High School); the University of Glasgow; the Sorbonne and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied French and German.

Retrieved 7 September 2011  Early professional work  After graduating, Cairncross took the British Civil Service exam and won first place. An article in the Glasgow Herald on 29 September 1936 noted that Cairncross had scored an \\"outstanding double success of being placed 1st in the Home List and 1st in the competition for the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service,\\" and that he had been placed fifth in the (Glasgow University) bursary competition of 1930, and was also a Scholar and Bell Exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge.Glasgow Herald, 29 September 1936. Cairncross worked initially in the Foreign Office before transferring to the Treasury and then the Cabinet Office, where he worked as a private secretary to Lord Hankey, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. It has been suggested that in 1936 whilst at Cambridge, Cairncross joined the CPGB, but he was not noted whilst at university for any political activity by his brother, Alec who was also at Cambridge until 1935. Sir Alec also recalled that John \\"was a prickly young man, who was difficult to argue with and resented things rather easily\\".  Second World War  In 1942 and 1943 Cairncross worked in GC&CS;, Bletchley Park on ULTRA ciphers. In 1944, he joined MI6. = Government Code and Cypher School, Bletchley Park = During his time at Bletchley Park, Cairncross passed documents through secret channels to the Soviet Union.Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky, KGB: The Inside Story of its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbatchev, London, Hodder and Stoughton, 1990, note 5, p. 247. Cairncross, codenamed Liszt by the Russians because of his love of music, had been instructed to get into Bletchley Park, known to the KGB as Kurort.Smith, Michael Station X: The Codebreakers of Bletchley Park (1998, Channel 4 Books, London) pp 155‚Äì156 From 1942 onwards, the German High Command communicated with Army group commanders in the field using a machine that the British codenamed Tunny. Colossus, the world's first electronic digital computer, deciphered Tunny messages in quantity from 1943 onwards. Cairncross smuggled Tunny decrypts due to be destroyed out of Hut 3 in his trousers, transferring them to his bag at the railway station before going to meet his NKVD contact in London. The Soviets were particularly interested in traffic between Berlin-Pskov, Berlin- Helsinki, Berlin-Lisbon, Trebizond-Istanbul, Berlin-Bucharest, and Kirkenes- Oslo. They were also interested in British efforts to decipher Soviet ciphers and in the joint effort by German and Japanese cipher experts to decipher Soviet signals including military ones, which the combined German-Japanese effort failed to achieve with the Soviet diplomatic ciphers. The raw transcripts decrypted by Colossus were passed to intelligence officers at Bletchley Park, who created reports based on this material by disguising its origin as signals traffic. By providing verbatim transcripts, Cairncross showed the Soviets that the British were breaking German codes. It was at that time considered to be in the British interest for the Soviet Union to be made aware of German military plans, but not of how they were obtained. Only information based on these reports was passed to the Russians through official channels. However, Stalin distrusted unsourced intelligence presented to him by Britain and the United States.  Operation Citadel  Operation Citadel was the codename given by Nazi Germany to their offensive which led to the Battle of Kursk. After being defeated at Kursk, the Wehrmacht retreated steadily until Berlin was taken. Tunny decrypts (transcripts) gave the British advance intelligence about Operation Citadel whilst it was being planned. Almost all raw transcripts were destroyed at the end of the war but a surviving transcript dated 25 April 1943 from German Army Group South signed by Maximilian von Weichs shows the high level of detail available to British intelligence officers. Analysts deduced the northern and southern attack routes, and a report based on this transcript was passed through official channels to Stalin. During this period, Cairncross provided a second clandestine channel, supplying raw Tunny transcripts directly.  Tito and the Yugoslav partisans  Axis occupation forces in Yugoslavia used radio communication extensively. In addition to German Abwehr, SD, Luftwaffe, naval, railway, Army group and High Command messages, GC&CS; intercepted and decrypted Yugoslav partisan communications with Comintern and with the Soviet Union. Cairncross first in Hut 3, then later at MI6 HQ, had access to raw decrypts. Communications from Comintern to Tito supplying some of this intelligence, strongly suggest that he passed decrypts concerning Yugoslavia to the KGB. (Updated and extended version of Action This Day: From Breaking of the Enigma Code to the Birth of the Modern Computer Bantam Press 2001) As a spy Between 1941 and 1945, Cairncross supplied the Soviets with 5,832 documents, according to Russian archives. In 1944, Cairncross joined MI6, the foreign intelligence service. In Section V, the counter-intelligence section, Cairncross produced under the direction of Kim Philby an order of battle of the SS. Cairncross later suggested that he was unaware of Philby's connections with the Russians. In October 1944, he wrote to his Soviet leaders in foreign intelligence that \\"I am delighted that our friends found my help worthy of attention, and I am proud that I contributed something to the victory, which led to the almost complete cleansing of the Soviet land from the invaders\\". In March 1945, he was awarded a ¬£1,000 per year pension but he refused to accept it. Yuri Modin, the Russian MGB (later KGB) Controller in London claims that Cairncross gave him details of nuclear arms to be stationed with NATO in West Germany. He gives no date for this message. But Cairncross was at the Ministry of Supply in 1951 and NATO was established in April 1949. However, there was no such plan at this time and it was only much later that NATO obtained tactical nuclear weapons under US control in Germany. This appears to have been a disinformation exercise.S.J.Hamrick (W.T.Tyler) Deceiving the Deceivers) ; Yale University Press, New Haven and London 2004. In September 1951, he was questioned by British counterintelligence about his relationship with Maclean and the Communist Party. Cairncross had been trained by the Soviets on how to behave during a counterintelligence interrogation. On 23 October 1951, Cairncross informed his Soviet controller that he had merely explained to the interrogator that he did not hide his membership with the party and that he would merely greet Maclean when he worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but did not maintain any contact with Maclean after graduation. For security, the residence temporarily stopped contact with him, allowed him to continue to report monthly his situation with appropriate signals, and planned a follow up meeting on 23 January 1952. The Soviets developed an exfiltration plan for Cairncross including funds, documents, and communication methods while living in other countries. However, Cairncross did not signal his controller until an early March 1952 meeting during which Cairncross stated that he had been interrogated again. The residency did not have any more contact with Cairncross and instructed Kim Philby to determine Cairncross's whereabouts. Philby could not determine the whereabouts of Cairncross. Cairncross admitted to spying in 1951 after MI5 found papers in Guy Burgess's flat with a handwritten note from him, after Burgess's flight to Moscow. Philby had also informed the residency of this. Some believe that he may have supplied information about the Western atomic weapons programme, the Manhattan Project, to assist the Soviet nuclear programme.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West, London, Penguin Books, 2000. note 13, p. 150 It would have been surprising, though, if he had clearance to any useful engineering information, or that he would have understood it. He was never prosecuted which later led to charges that the government engaged in a conspiracy to cover up his role. The identity of the infamous 'fifth man' in the Cambridge Five remained a mystery outside intelligence circles until 1990, when KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky confirmed Cairncross publicly.Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky, KGB: The Inside Story of its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbatchev, London, Hodder & Stoughton, 1990, note 5, pp. 210 and 253. Cairncross worked independently of the other four and did not share their upper-middle-class backgrounds or tastes. Although he knew Anthony Blunt at Cambridge, Guy Burgess socially (and had a dislike of both of them), Donald Maclean from the Foreign Office and Kim Philby from MI6, he claimed not to have been aware that they were also passing secrets to the Russians. Later life At the end of the war Cairncross joined the Treasury ‚Äì he claimed that he ceased working for the MGB (later to become the KGB), at this time. KGB reports, published subsequently, contradict this. After his first confession (1952), Cairncross lost his civil-service job and was penniless and unemployed. He moved to the United States as a lecturer at Northwestern University and at Case Western Reserve University. Caincross became an expert on French authors and translated the works of many 17th century French poets and dramatists such as Jean Racine, Jean de La Fontaine and Pierre Corneille, as well as writing three of his own books: Moli√®re bourgeois et libertin; New Light on Moli√®re; and After Polygamy was Made a Sin. This career was ended following further investigation into Cairncross by MI5 investigative officer Arthur S. Martin. After Philby fled to Moscow in 1963, Martin reopened the files to hunt for the fourth and fifth men in 1964. To Martin's surprise, Cairncross made a full confession. Martin also received a denunciation which led to Blunt's confession. Despite his confession to Martin, Cairncross was never prosecuted for his espionage activities. The confession, conducted in Cleveland, Ohio, was not made within British jurisdiction or under caution and would therefore have been inadmissable in court. After the counterintelligence proceedings were completed, he was allowed to travel abroad and moved to Canada where he worked as a teacher. In 1967, Cairncross moved to Rome, where he worked for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization as a translator, also taking on work for the Research Office of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Banca d'Italia and IMI. In 1970, he moved to France and lived in Provence. In the BNL, a young economist engaged with international scenarios analysis (the Iran‚ÄìIraq War of 1980‚Äì1988, petroleum's strategic routes in the Middle East and Far East) reported a strong and unusual interest by Cairncross about the bank's role in that area. During his time in Rome, his secret finally reached the public. In December 1979, Barrie Penrose, a journalist, concluded that Cairncross was the \\"fifth man\\" and confronted him. Cairncross's third confession became front- page news. In 1981, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher informed parliament that Cairncross was a Soviet agent and was living with his wife in the west of England while he wrote his memoirs. His status as the \\"fifth man\\" was supported years later by Oleg Gordievsky, the KGB defector. Cairncross retired to the south of France until 1995 when he returned to Britain and married American opera singer Gayle Brinkerhoff. Later that year he died after suffering a stroke, at the age of 82. Cairncross's autobiography, The Enigma Spy, was published in 1997. In 2001, writer Rupert Allason lost a court case in which he claimed to have ghostwritten The Enigma Spy in return for copyright and 50% of the book proceeds. In fiction Cairncross is depicted in part three of the 2003 BBC TV series Cambridge Spies, where he appears reluctant to continue passing Bletchley Park data to the Russians for fear that the Red Army was heavily penetrated by German intelligence and by Eastern Front military intelligence under General Gehlen. Anthony Blunt is depicted in the drama as pressuring him with threats. Cairncross appears as a character in the Franco-Belgian comic India Dreams by Maryse and Jean-Fran√ßois Charles. He is depicted as the fifth of the Cambridge Five in Frederick Forsyth's The Deceiver. Cairncross appears as a cryptographer at Bletchley Park in the 2014 film The Imitation Game, played by Allen Leech. He is portrayed as an unwitting double agent being used as a back-channel by MI6 to pass information to the Soviets that Churchill is too cautious to provide; no historical basis for this is provided.

They are sometimes distinguished from the immediate predecessor (successor?), the female ruler Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten (usually identified as Nefertiti). Unlike Neferneferuaten, Smenkhkare did not use epithets in their royal name or cartouche.Aidan Dodson, \\"Amarna Sunset:the late-Amarna succession revisited\\" in Beyond the Horizon. Studies in Egyptian Art, Archaeology and History and history in Honour of Barry J. Kemp, ed. S. Ikram and A. Dodson, pp.31‚Äì32 Cairo, 2009. Very little is known of Smenkhkare for certain because later kings, beginning with Horemheb, sought to erase the entire Amarna Period from history. Name confusion ::For the complete historiography regarding the names, see Neferneferuaten Line drawing from Meryre II. The lost names had been recorded previously (inset) as Smenkhkare and Meritaten. Smenkhkare was known to Egyptologists as far back as 1845 from the tomb of Meryre II. There he and Meritaten, bearing the title Great Royal Wife, are shown rewarding the tomb's owner. The names of the king have since been cut out but had been recorded by Lepsius around 1850.de Garies Davies, N. 1905. The Rock Tombs of El Amarna, Part II: The Tombs of Panehesy and Meryra II. Archaeological Survey of Egypt. F. L. Griffith. London: Egypt Exploration Fund. Later, a different set of names emerged using the same throne name: \\"Ankhkheperure mery Neferkheperure [Akhenaten] Neferneferuaten mery Wa en Re [Akhenaten]\\". This led to a great deal of confusion since throne names tended to be unique.Dodson, A. (2009) p 34 For the better part of a century, the repetition of throne names was taken to mean that Smenkhare changed his name to Neferneferuaten at some point, probably upon the start of his sole reign. Indeed, Petrie makes exactly that distinction in his excavation notes of 1894. By the 1970s, feminine traces in some versions of the name and more often in the epithets led to various theories. Among them, that Nefertiti was masquerading as Smenkhkare before changing her name again to Neferneferuaten. When considered with various stelae depicting Akhenaten with another king in familiar, if not intimate poses, the theory that Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were homosexual arose. In 1978, it was proposed that there were two individuals using the same name: a male king Smenkhkare and a female Neferneferuaten.Krauss, R. (1978) p 43-47 Ten years later, James Peter Allen pointed out the name 'Ankhkheperure' nearly always included an epithet referring to Akhenaten such as 'desired of Wa en Re' when coupled with 'Neferneferuaten'. There were no occasions where the 'long' versions of the prenomen occurred alongside the nomen 'Smenkhkare', nor was the ‚Äòshort‚Äô version ever found associated with the nomen 'Neferneferuaten'.Allen, J. (1988) The issue of a female Neferneferuaten was finally settled for the remaining holdouts when Allen confirmed Marc Gabolde's findings that objects from Tutankhamun's tomb originally inscribed for Neferneferuaten which had been read using the epithet \\"...desired of Akhenaten\\" were originally inscribed as Akhet-en-hyes or \\"effective for her husband\\".Gabolde, M. (1998) pp 147‚Äì62, 213‚Äì219Dodson A. and Hilton D. (2004) p.285 Smenkhkare, as son in law, might be 'desired of Akhenaten', but only a female could fit the new reading. By the start of the 21st century, \\"a fair degree of consensus\\"Miller, J. (2007) p 272 emerged that Neferneferuaten was a female king and Smenkhkare a separate male king, particularly among specialists of the periodMiller, J. (2007) p 272; To wit: Allen (1994); Gabolde (1998); Eaton-Krauss and Krauss(2001); Hornung (2006); von Beckerath (1997); Allen (2006); Krauss (2007); Murnane (2001) They otherwise hold very different views on the succession, chronology and identity of Neferneferuaten.Almost as important, when presented with just the name Ankhkheperure, it is now widely accepted that the use of epithets indicates Neferneferuaten while no epithets indicates Smenkhkare.e.g. Murnane, J. The End of the Amarna Period Once Again (2001); Allen, J. 1998, 2006; Gabolde, M. Das Ende der Amarnazeit (2001); Hornung, E. (2006); Miller, J. (2007), p 274 n 96, 97, 98; Dodson A. (2009), p 36. Another reason for confusion is that the hieroglyphs in the cartouche in the picture showing \\"Smenkhkare\\" and Meritaten rewarding Meryra II actually are not to be read as Smenkhkare, but as Saakare, or Saakara or Seaakara, according to the different transliterations. The cartouche contains s-aa-ka-re [and not the spelling present in the Royal Titulary presented on this page] like in \\"Rock Tombs of El Amarna II\\" by Norman de Garis Davieshttps://archive.org/stream/cu31924020525352#page/n53/mode/2up Rock Tombs of El Amarna II, page 43, 5 MERYRA REWARDED BY KING SE-AA-KA-RA where it is possible to see the primary source [mentioned also in the picture].

The quality of what remains cannot allow one to be totally sure if it is Smenkhkare or Saakare; and Carter in his notes does not express an opinion.http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/carter/405.html Globular vase with the cartouches of Akhenaten and Smenkhkare A source for the name Smenkhkare is a ring, associated with another one showing Saakare.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums- static/digitalegypt/chronology/semenkhkare.html Smenkhkare The explanation is a probable mistake made by Lepsius copying the cartouches. Davies mentions another source, PRISSE Monuments Egyptiens, where another copy of the cartouches is present and the aspect is not so clear.Monuments Egyptiens Also John Pendlebury found objects carrying the name Smenkhkare.MEEF 40 Frankfort, H, Pendlebury The City of Akhenaton II, Plate L, 29MEEF 44.2 Pendlebury, The City of Akhenaton III, Plate CXII, IV E 9 Evidence Aside from the Meryre tomb depiction already mentioned there are several pieces of evidence which establish Smenkhkare as king. *A calcite \\"globular vase\\" from the tomb of Tutankhamun bears the full double cartouche of Akhenaten alongside the full double cartouche of Smenkhkare. This is the only object to carry both names side by side.Allen, J. 2006 p 2 *A single wine docket, 'Year 1, wine of the house of Smenkhkare', indicates he probably had a short reign.Pendlebury, J. D. S. The City of Akhenaten (1951), Part III, vol II, pl 86 Another dated to Year 1 from 'The House of Smenkhkare (deceased)'Pendlebury, J. D. S. The City of Akhenaten (1951), Part III, pl lxxxvi and xcvii was originally taken to indicate that he died during the harvest of his first year; more recently it has been proposed to mean his estate was still producing wine in the first year of his successor. This image is commonly taken to be Smenkhkare and Meritaten, though it may be Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun. *Line drawings of a block depicting the nearly complete names of King Smenkhkare and Meritaten as Great Royal Wife were recorded before the block was lost. *Flinders Petrie documented six rings bearing only the Throne Name 'Ankhkheperure' (the other six with the same Throne Name show an epithet: or Mery Neferkheperure, no. 92 and no. 93; or Mery Waenre, no. 94, 95 and 96) and two more bearing 'Smenkhkare' (with another one bearing the epithet Djeserkheperu, which belonged to SmenkhkareFlinders Petrie, Tell El Amarna - Plate XV) in excavations of the palace.Petrie, 1894 pl xv One example is Item UC23800 in the Petrie Museum which clearly shows the \\"djeser\\" and \\"kheperu\\" elements and a portion of the 'ka' glyph. Pendlebury found more when the town was cleared.Pendlebury, 1951 *A ring bearing his name is found at Malqata in Thebes. *Perhaps the most magnificent was a vast hall more than 125 metres square and including over 500 pillars. This late addition to the central palace has been known as the Hall of Rejoicing, Coronation Hall, or simply Smenkhkare Hall because a number of bricks stamped Ankhkheperure in the House of Rejoicing in the Aten were found at the site.Dodson A. (2006) p 31-32; also Pendlebury, 1951 PIs. XIII C. XLIV. 1, 2 *Indisputable images for Smenkhkare are rare. Aside from the tomb of Meryre II, the adjacent image showing an Amarna king and queen in a garden is often attributed to him. It is completely without inscription, but since they do not look like Tutankhamun or his queen, they are often assumed to be Smenkhkare and Meritaten, but Akhenaten and Nefertiti are sometimes put forth as well. *An inscription in the tomb of Pairi, TT139, by the other Ankhkheperure (Neferneferuaten), mentions a functioning Amen 'temple of Ankhkheperure'.A.H. Gardiner, The Graffito from the Tomb of Pere; JEA 14 (1928), pp. 10‚Äì11 and pls. 5‚Äì6. Several items from the tomb of Tutankhamun bear the name of Smenkhkare: *A linen garment decorated with 39 gold daisies along with 47 other sequins bearing the prenomen of Smenkhkare alongside Meritaten's name. *Carter number 101s is a linen shawl with the name Ankhkheperure *A compound bow (Carter 48h) and the mummy bands (Carter 256b) were both reworked for Tutankhamun.Reeves, C. 1990b *Less certain, but much more impressive is the second anthropoid coffin containing the mummy of Tutankhamun. The face depicted is much more square than that of the other coffins and quite unlike the gold mask or other depictions of Tutankhamun. The coffin is Rishi style and inlaid with coloured glass, a feature only found on this coffin and one from KV55, the speculated resting place for the mummy of Smenkhkare. Since both cartouches show signs of being reworked, Dodson and Harrison conclude this was most likely originally made for Smenkhkare and reinscribed for Tutankhamun.Dodson, A. 1992 and 2009 p 41 As the evidence came to light in bits and pieces at a time when Smenkhkare was assumed to have also used the name Neferneferuaten, perhaps at the start of his sole reign, it sometimes defied logic. For instance, when the mortuary wine docket surfaced from the 'House of Smenkhkare (deceased)', it seemed to appear that he changed his name back before he died. Since his reign was brief, and he may never have been more than co-regent, the evidence for Smenkhkare is not plentiful, but nor is it quite as insubstantial as it is sometimes made out to be. It certainly amounts to more than just 'a few rings and a wine docket' or that he 'appears only at the very end of Ahkenaton's reign in a few monuments'Britannica entry for Smenkhkare; retrieved Dec 2012 as is too often portrayed. Co-regent The Meryre depiction of Smenkhkare both as king and as son-in-law to Akhenaten along with the jar inscription seems to indicate that Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were coregents, and it was initially taken to mean just that. However, the scene in the tomb of Meryre is not dated and Akhenaten is neither depicted nor mentioned in it. The jar may simply be a case of one king associating himself with a predecessor. The simple association of names, particularly on everyday objects, is not conclusive of a coregency.Murnane, W. (1977) pp. 213‚Äì15Allen, J. (2006) p 3 To make matters more confusing, he has competition as the prime candidate as Akhenaten's coregent and successor, the female Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten. =Neferneferuaten= The evidence for Neferneferuaten's association with Akhenaten is more substantial.James P. Allen, \\"The Amarna Succession\\" in Causing His Name to Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J. Murnane, ed. P. Brand and L. Cooper. Culture and History of the Ancient Near East 37. Leiden: E. J. Brill Academic Publishers, 2006 As detailed above, all but a very few of her cartouches associate her with Akhenaten in the form of \\"...desired of Neferkheperure [Akhenaten's throne name]\\" and \\"...desired of Wa en Re [epithet of Akhenaten's throne name]\\".Allen, A. (2006) p 1-2 Many things from Tutankhamun's tomb either bear her name, or were originally made for her and reinscribed with his name. These include a stunning gold pectoral depicting the goddess Nut, his stone sarcophagus, mummy bands, royal figurines, various bracelets, and canopic items. Of particular interest is a box (Carter 001k) inscribed with the names of Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten and Meritaten as Great Royal Wife. A hieratic inscription on the lid repeats the inscription from the rail. There are also a series of stelae clearly showing what is accepted as Akhenaten along with a female figure wearing a crown. Most of these are uninscribed and damaged so while they pictorially attest to an association of Akhenaten with a female coregent, they fail to identify her by name. One such (stele, Berlin #17813 or a higher resolution image) depicts two royal figures in a familiar, if not intimate, pose. One figure wears the double crown, while the other, slightly more feminine one, wears the Khepresh or \\"blue crown\\". However, the set of three empty cartouches can only account for the names of a king and queen. This has been interpreted to mean that Nefertiti may have at one point been something like a coregent as indicated by the crown, but not entitled to full pharaonic honors such as the double cartouche.Dodson, A. (2009) p 42 Another stele, Berlin 25574, clearly depicts Akhenaten and Nefertiti in her familiar flat top crown. Above them are four empty cartouches ‚Äì enough for two kings ‚Äì one of which seems to have been squeezed in. Nicholas Reeves sees this as an important item in the case for Nefertiti as female coregent. When the stele was started, she was queen and portrayed with the flat top headpiece. She was elevated to coregent shortly afterwards and a fourth cartouche was squeezed in to accommodate two kings.Reeves, C. (2001) p 167-168 Perhaps the most important stela has the opposite condition and could tell us much more if it was not so badly damaged. In 1891, a private stela was found which is now in the Petrie Museum, U.C. 410, sometimes called the Coregency Stela. On this stela, most of the scene is missing but the inscriptions can be read It depicts the double cartouche of Akhenaten alongside that of Ankhkheperure mery-Waenre Neferneferuaten Akhet-en-hyes ('effective for her husband'). The inscription originally bore the single cartouche of Nefertiti, which was erased along with a reference to Meritaten to make room for the double cartouche of King Neferneferuaten.Dodson, A. (2009); p 43 The identity of King Neferneferuaten is a matter of debate. Initially, Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten were assumed to be the same person, primarily on the basis of the repeated throne name. Today the leading candidates are Nefertiti or Meritaten. =Interpretations= There is an impression that there is substantial evidence for Smenkhkare as coregent and successor. This began over 100 years ago when Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten were assumed to be the same person.Petrie, W. (1894) pp 42‚Äì44 If all the evidence for both Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten are seen to represent a single person, it would be a natural, logical, and obvious conclusion that they were coregent and successor. As son- in-law to Akhenaten and wearing the blue crown in Meryre's tomb, Smenkhkare as coregent is a conclusion embraced by some Egyptologists. However, the name Smenkhkare appears only during the reign of AkhenatenDuhig, Corinne. \\"The remains of Pharaoh Akhenaten are not yet identified: comments on 'Biological age of the skeletonized mummy from Tomb KV55 at Thebes (Egypt)' by Eugen Strouhal\\" in Anthropologie: International Journal of the Science of Man Vol 48 Issue 2 (2010), pp 113‚Äì115. with nothing to attest to a sole reign with any certainty. The name Neferneferuaten is a much more recent addition to the picture. Much of the evidence for her has had to be resurrected from erased inscriptions and she has become accepted as an individual by most Egyptologists only within the last 20 years. As a newcomer, many synoptic references such as encyclopedias, museum chronologies, atlases, and king lists do not even mention her. In her case, the Pairi inscription offers a clear indication of a sole reign with a coregency being more a matter of interpretation. As a result, Egyptologists remain divided on the identity of Akhenaten's coregent and his successor. Aidan Dodson uses the Meryre depiction to conclude that Smenkhkare served only as coregent starting about Year 13 of Akhenaten with the wine docket simply indicating that his estate was still in operation several years later. Nefertiti became his next coregent as King Neferneferuaten (perhaps with abbreviated honors) and succeeded him.Dodson, A. (2006) p 27-29 The main argument against this until very recently (see below) has been the assumption that Nefertiti died once she disappeared from the record after Year 13. James Allen on the other hand, sees Neferneferuaten as the coregent who succeeds Akhenaten largely on the basis of the epithets and stelae. He assumes that Nefertiti has died, and has offered her daughter, Neferneferuaten-tasherit (the lesser, or \\"junior\\") as King Neferneferuaten on the basis of her name. She is followed by Smenkhkare after her two- to three- year reign. He has also speculated that 'both' succeeded Akhenaten: Neferneferuaten as Akhenaten's \\"chosen\\" successor and Smenkhkare as a rival king using the same prenomen, perhaps to eclipse Akhenaten's unacceptable choice.Allen, James P. (1994). Nefertiti and Smenkh-ka-re. G√∂ttinger Miszellen 141. pp. 7‚Äì17 Others have advocated for Meritaten as Neferneferuaten in different forms, perhaps succeeding Akhenaten during an interregnum. Marc Gabolde has long advocated that she continued to rule as Neferneferuaten after the death of Smenkhkare. The main argument against this is the box from Tutankhamun's tomb listing Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten and Meritaten as three individuals.Allen, J. 2006, p. 14, also n. 61 Few succession theories account for all the evidence and only rarely do they offer an explanation for the consecutive use of the same throne name. Dodson, for instance, places Smenkhkare's brief coregency in Year 13/14, whereas the Smenkhkare Hall is believed to be built about Year 15. The hall, grand as it must have been, was surely built for some significant event related to Ankhkheperure. Allen's placement of Smenkhkare fares no better. Work is believed to have halted on the Amarna tombs shortly after Year 13,Giles, F. 2001; also Aldred 1988Dodson, A. 2006, p 29 so the depiction of Smenkhkare as king in Meryre II must date to about Year 13. For him to have succeeded Neferneferuaten means that aside from a lone wine docket, he left not a single trace over the course of five to six years (Years 14‚Äì17 of Akhenaten, a two to three year reign for Neferneferuaten). Gabolde's Meritaten theory has the problem of the various private stelae depicting the female coregent with Akhenaten who would be dead by the time of her rule. He suggests these are retrospective, but since they are private cult stelae, this would require a number of people to get the same idea to commission a retrospective, commemorative stela at the same time. Allen notes that the everyday interaction portrayed in them more likely indicates two living people. Nefertiti Year 16 graffito In December 2012, the Leuven Archaeological Mission announced the find of a hieratic inscription in a limestone quarry at Dayr Abu Hinnis which primarily concerns a building project in Amarna. The text is dated to Year 16 month 3 of Akhet, day 15 of the reign of Akhenaten and refers to Nefertiti as the Great Royal Wife.A. van der Perre, \\"The Year 16 graffito of Akhenaten in Dayr Ab≈´ ·∏§innis. A Contribution to the Study of the Later Years of Nefertiti.\\" Journal of Egyptian History(JEH) 7 (2014), pp.72‚Äì73 & 76‚Äì77 This find invalidates the view that she died about year 13/14 of Akhenaten. With Nefertiti still alive and chief consort in the second to last year of her husband's reign, whatever coregency was yet to come would be limited to a year or less. Year 17 would be Akhenaten's final year and as the changes to the Coregency Stela (UC 410) seem to indicate, by the time the female coregent was added to it she was also already acting on behalf of Akhenaten. Dakhamunzu Hittite affair The Deeds of Suppiluliuma written by his son Mursili II are sometimes used to provide a resolution for the succession order of Egypt. Several succession theories incorporate the episode. The story tells of an Egyptian queen named Dakhamunzu, who writes to Suppiluliuma. She tells him her husband, the king, Nibhururiya, has died and asks him to send a son for her to marry 'for she has no sons and he has many'; in marrying her, his son 'will become King of Egypt'. The Hittite king is wary and sends an envoy to verify the lack of a male heir. The queen writes back rebuking Suppiluliuma for suggesting she lied about a son and indicates she is loath to marry a \\"servant\\". Suppiluliuma sends one of his sons, Zannanza, off to Egypt, but he dies sometime after departing. It has been supposed that he was murdered at the border of Egypt (Brier) to thwart the plot, but there is no evidence as to when or where he died, nor that he was murdered, as opposed to death from a lethal injury, accident, or illness en route. Dakhamunzu (probably the Hittite transliteration of ta hemet nesu or king's wife) has traditionally been seen as Ankhesenamun since she had no sons and did eventually marry a \\"servant\\", Ay. The dead king, Nibhururiya, then refers to Tutankhamun's throne name, Nebkheperure. Some have argued that Nibhururiya might be a reference to Neferkheperure (Akhenaten), certainly the X-kheper-u-Re variations in 18th Dynasty throne names makes it possible. Of the male kings in the period, Smenkhkare can be ruled out as his throne name would be transliterated as something like Anahuriya.Miller, J. (2007) Writing on the Dakhamunzu episode, Jared Miller points out that \\"‚Äòservant‚Äô is likely used in a disparaging manner, rather than literally, and probably with reference to real person(s) who indeed were being put forth as candidates.\\" If the reference to a 'servant' no longer exclusively indicates Ay, then Meritaten and Nefertiti become candidates as well.Miller, J. (2007) p 261 For the plot to succeed, the queen would have to either wield an extraordinary amount of power in order to prevent or delay the marriage to the \\"servant\\" or enjoy the backing of some powerful supporter(s) while the correspondence and travels take place.Miller, J. (2007) p 275 Miller also offers the prominence of sun deities with the Hittite king as a motivating factor in the queen preferring a Hittite prince over a Babylonian one.Miller, J. (2007) p 273 n92 =Nefertiti= Reeves identifies Dakhamunzu as Nefertiti. After 17 years on the throne alongside her husband, she can certainly be seen having sufficient power and backing.Reeves, C.N. (2001) pp. 176‚Äì177 Though she may also be King Neferneferuaten, she is writing as a queen, perhaps to secure a male figurehead, or perhaps she envisioned a coregency like the one she had with Akhenaten. The argument against Nefertiti is that she would have had to conceal the presence of at least one male of royal lineage from the spies and envoy of Suppiluliuma. Alternatively, if he knew of Tutankhaten or Smenkhkare, rather than merely being shrewd, it must be assumed that Suppiluliuma was ruthless in the extreme and willing to risk the life of his son on a precarious endeavor where he suspected trickery.Miller, J. (2007) p 260-261. Miller believes Suppiluliuma was indeed that \\"brutal [and] unscrupulous\\" On the other hand, it portrays Nefertiti as fully informed of Hittite minutiae such as Suppiluliuma's affiliation with the Hittite sun god. =Meritaten= As shown on the box from Tutankhamun's tomb, Meritaten came to take Nefertiti's place as royal wife late in Akhenaten's reign. Marc Gabolde has proposed that Meritaten is Dakhamunzu and the dead king is Akhenaten, in a number of articles. He supposes that Zannanza completed the trip and died only after ascending the throne as Smenkhkare. It is after the death of Smenkhkare/Zannanza that Meritaten assumes power as Neferneferuaten. Meritaten seems the least likely on the basis that at the time of Akhenaten's death she would only have been about 20 years old. By contrast, Ankhesenamun would have been about 25 and been queen consort for some ten years. It seems unlikely that the young Meritaten would have the wiles to deceive Suppiluliuma, maintain her interregnum in the face of pressure to marry a 'servant' and conceal the presence of a male heir in the personage of Tutankhamun. =Ankhesenamun= In support of Ankhesenamun, is the idea that Tutankhamun 'lay in state' for some time. The Hittite sources indicate he died in late summer, around the middle of August.Bryce, T. R. (1990) p 105 However, a cornflower pectoral indicates he was not buried until April or May.Newberry, P. E. (1927) p 196 As such, there may have been time for letter writing and travel. Ankhesenamun is made more plausible if she had the backing of Ay, or Horemheb, or both. Against her is the simpler explanation that the delay in burial was the result of Tutankamun's unexpected death and unfinished tomb. Details for the Dakhamunzu/Zannanza affair are entirely from Hittite sources written many years after the events. There is the possibility that Mursili is revising history to some extent, placing full responsibility for the fiasco on the Egyptians,Miller, J.; (2007) p 262 leaving the details unreliable. Reign The sole regnal date (year 1) attested for Smenkhkare comes from a wine docket from \\"the house of Smenkhkare\\". This date might however refer either to the reign of Smenkhkare or his successor, but it is doubtful he ruled for more than a year.Allen, J.; 2006 p 5 As already noted, Dodson views Smenkhkare as Akhenaten's coregent for about a year beginning about Year 13 and who did not have a sole reign,Dodson, A. (2009) p 39 while Allen depicts Smenkhkare as successor to Neferneferuaten. There are those who see the possibility of a two- or three-year reign for Smenkhkare. A number of wine dockets from Amarna bear dates for regnal years 2 and 3, but lack a king's name. A few EgyptologistsMiller, J. (2007) p 275, to wit: Krauss, R. 1997:247; 2007 and Hornung, E. 2006:207 have argued these should be attributed to Smenkhkare. However, these are open to interpretation and cannot be considered decisive. Clear evidence for a sole reign for Smenkhkare has not yet been found. Death and burial The desecrated royal coffin found in Tomb KV55 In 1907, a tomb was discovered by Edward R. Ayrton while working in the Valley of the Kings for Theodore M. Davis. Within it was found a number of funerary objects for various people‚Äîin particular, a shrine built for Queen Tiye by Akhenaten, and a mummy. This caused Davis to refer to it as The Tomb of Queen Tiye; its more common designation is KV55. The tomb is sometimes called a cache because items from several people are found there. For example, there is the shrine for Tiye, 'magic bricks' bearing Akhenaten's name and alabaster canopic jars depicting what is thought to be the likeness of Kiya. Of particular interest is the mummy found there. The coffin had been desecrated and the name of the owner removed, but it was in the Rishi style of the 18th Dynasty. It is generally accepted that the coffin was originally intended for a female, possibly Akhenaten's wife Kiya, and later reworked to accommodate a male.Davis, T.M. The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. xii Over the past century, the chief candidates for this individual have been either Akhenaten or Smenkhkare.Davis, T.M., The Tomb of Queen Tiyi, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. viii, p. xivAldred, C. (1988) p. 205Giles, F. J. (2001) The case for Akhenaten rests largely on the 'magic bricks' and the reworking of some of the inscriptions on the coffin. The case for Smenkhkare comes mostly from the presumed age of the mummy (see below) which, between ages 18 and 26 would not fit Akhenaten who reigned for 17 years and had fathered a child near by his first regnal year. There is nothing in the tomb positively identified as belonging to Smenkhkare, nor is his name found there. The tomb is certainly not befitting any king, but even less so for Akhenaten. =Early examinations of the mummy= The skull of the KV55 mummy, believed to be Smenkhkare. The skeletonized mummy was examined on a number of occasions over the years, including by Smith (1912), Derry (1931), Harrison (1966), Strouhal (1998/2010) and Filer (2001). Wente used craniofacial analysis in 1995 (as well as examining past X-rays) to examine a cache of mummies, mostly from the 18th Dynasty, in order to sort out the relationships and true identities of each. Serological tests on the KV55 remains and Tutankhamun's mummy were performed and published in Nature (1974). The KV55 mummy was also examined by Harris in 1988, but only an abstract of the results was published, and most recently by Hawass, Gad et al. in 2010. Filer's conclusions were largely representative of the pre-2010 examinations, noting \\"...this man was not quite a fully mature adult, between 18 and 21 years when he died.\\" She concluded: These were largely in keeping with the previous results (18‚Äì26 years) allowing for the technologies available. For instance, Derry concluded an age of about 23 and Strouhal gave an age range of 19 to 22.Strouhal, E. \\"Biological age of skeletonized mummy from Tomb KV 55 at Thebes\\" in Anthropologie: International Journal of the Science of Man Vol 48 Issue 2 (2010), pp 97‚Äì112. Dr. Strouhal examined KV55 in 1998, but the results were apparently delayed and perhaps eclipsed by Filer's examination in 2000. Strouhal's findings were published in 2010 to dispute the Hawass et al conclusions. Wente's study found close cranial similarities between the mummies of Tutankhamun, KV55 and Thutmose IV.Wente, E. 1995 The serological tests indicated KV55 and Tutankhamun shared the same rare blood type.Nature 224 (1974), 325f. Taken together, the KV55 mummy was assumed to be the father or brother of Tutankhamun. A brother seemed more likely since the age would only be old enough to plausibly father a child at the upper extremes. =Genetic tests of 2010= In 2010, genetic tests and CT scans were performed with some of the results published in JAMA and reported in National Geographic, including a TV special.Hawass, Z., Y. Z. Gad, et al. \\"Ancestry and Pathology in King Tutankhamun's Family\\". Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), 2010. Chief among the genetic results was, \\"The statistical analysis revealed that the mummy KV55 is most probably the father of Tutankhamun (probability of 99.99999981%), and KV35 Younger Lady could be identified as his mother (99.99999997%).\\"Hawass, Gad, 2010; eAppendix; Details of Methods, Results, and Comment The report goes on to show that both KV55 and KV35 Younger Lady were siblings and children of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye.Hawass, Z., Y. Z. Gad, et al. in JAMA, fig 2 CT scans were also performed on the mummy from which it was concluded that his age at the time of death was much higher than all previous estimates. Evidence to support the much older claim was not provided beyond the single point of spinal degeneration. A growing body of work soon began to appear to dispute the assessment of the age of the mummy and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten.Nature 472, 404‚Äì406 (2011); Published online 27 April 2011; Original linkNewScientist.com; January, 2011; Royal Rumpus over King Tutankhamun's Ancestry JAMA 2010; 303(24):2471‚Äì2475. \\"King Tutankhamun‚Äôs Family and Demise\\"Bickerstaffe, D.

One letter to the JAMA editors came from Arizona State University bioarchaeologist Brenda J. Baker. The content was retold on the Archaeology News Network website and is representative of a portion of the dissent: An examination of the KV55 mummy was conducted in 1998 by Czech anthropologist Eugene Strouhal. He published his conclusions in 2010 where he 'utterly excluded the possibility of Akhenaten': Other criticisms surround what the project did not do. Wente had noted that the mummies of both Tutankamun and KV55 bore a very strong craniofacial similarity to the mummy of Thutmose IV, yet this mummy was not tested. Dylan Bickerstaffe calls it \\"almost perverse\\" that the mysterious \\"boy on a boat\\" found in KV35 was not tested while the \\"Elder Lady\\" and \\"Younger Lady\\" found there were. The boy could very well be Akhenaten's older brother Prince Thutmose or even Smenkhkare given that the KV35 ladies are now known to be related to Tutankamun. While it now seems likely that the KV55 mummy is the father of Tutankhamun, for many his identification as Akhenaten seems as doubtful as before. =Burial= Left alone in a tomb with few of the trappings of the typical Ancient Egyptian burial, the KV55 mummy appears to be not so much buried as disposed of. Since the KV55 mummy is conclusively a close relative of Tutankhamun, if not his father, why such a haphazard burial? It may simply be that they ran out of tombs or time. The royal family had been preparing tombs in Amarna rather than Thebes. As evidenced by the tomb of Meryre, work appears to have abruptly halted on the Amarna tombs after Year 13. About that time, a significant number of people depart the scene including three of Akhenaten's daughters, his mother and Kiya. In Amarna Letter 35, the king of Alashia apologizes to Akhenaten for his small greeting gift of copper, explaining that a plague had killed off many of his copper miners.Moran (1992) 107‚Äì119 Something similar may well have struck Amarna, if not Egypt. After the capital moved from Amarna, Akhenaten's successor could have been faced with a severe shortage of tombs for royal reburials.Giles, F. J. (1970) p 101-105 Smenkhkare would be in a particularly bad situation. Since he died young and reigned so briefly, he would not have had time to make and accumulate the grave goods befitting a king. In the end, the tomb seems to have been simply sealed up with the mummy and whatever was available. The tomb had been re-entered once and sealed twice.Bell, M.R. \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55\\", JARCE 27 (1990) p. 133 The seals date to the late 18th Dynasty indicating the tomb was entered and resealed probably under the reign of Tutankhamun. The nature of the debris, rubble fill and cement retaining wall suggest the desecration and attempt to remove the shrine of Tiye did not happen until later.Bell, M. R. (1990) p 133-135 The tomb was once again entered some time later, in the 19th, 20th or 21st Dynasty (opinions vary). Bell suggests that this entry may be related to the reburial of royal mummies and resulted in Tiye being moved to KV35. It was during this entry that Akhenaten's name and likeness were attacked where it could be found. The mummy itself was relatively unmolested: the wrappings were undisturbed but royal insignia were removed and various gold items were left behind including the gold vulture collar on the head of the mummy. Bell suggests feelings toward Akhenaten had softened by this time resulting in a \\"nameless king but still a consecrated pharaoh\\".Bell, M.R. (1990) p. 137 Others suggest that after desecrating Akhenaten's burial, including perhaps the destruction of his mummy, Smenkhkare was placed in Akhenaten's coffin.Perepelkin, Y. The Secret of the Gold Coffin (1978) p163-164 Summary Perhaps no one from the Amarna Interlude has been the subject of so much speculation as Smenkhkare.Dodson, A. (2009); p 30 There is just enough evidence to say with some certainty that he is an individual apart from Neferneferuaten, but not of a coregency or a sole reign. As a result, Egyptologists move him about like a pawn as their larger hypotheses requires. He can be proposed as Zannanza (Gabolde) or Nefertiti in disguise (Reeves, Samson, Habicht). He can reign for weeks or years. He is a short lived coregent with no independent reign (Dodson) or he is Akhenaten's successor (Allen).

Enigma continues to be very popular as an open source multi-platform derivative of Oxyd now that Oxyd is no longer maintained. The open source fangame Enigma has been praised in reviews. Enigma is a marble game. Landscapes usually take the form of logic puzzles, although frequently, dexterity with the pointing device (the only form of input) is also required. The game is based on a traditional square grid map (2D computer graphics) and a realistic physics simulation. Enigma is cross-platform and available for Mac OS X, GP2X, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD and Linux (with packages available for several distributions). Gameplay Enigma screenshot of level Enigma IV, #2: Double-Spiral Enigma consists of approximately 2500 levels, known as ‚Äòlandscapes‚Äô, which may be played in any order. The player controls one or more marbles using the mouse, and interacts with the landscape purely through the marble. Levels fall into two broad categories: Oxyd landscapes and Meditation landscapes. Some levels may appear to fall into one category while actually being in the other. =Obstacle course navigation= Often in each level, apart from the introductory ones that introduce the game gradually to the player, each level either contains a puzzle, race or many hazards (which tax the player's problem solving/logical skills, dexterity, patience and speed; these factors determine the overall difficulty of the level) which the player must solve, win or avoid or risk making the level impossible to solve (in which the player must restart it) or risk having the marble sink, fall down an abyss, destroyed or crushed. This takes away one of the players lives shown in the form of spare marbles in the inventory. The level automatically restarts from the beginning when all lives are lost, with the Oxyd colours randomly shuffled again. Some levels even are/have mazes which the player must find his/her way through. =Scoring system= Enigma also contains a score system which tracks how fast the player finishes the level. When a level is completed, a \\"personal record\\" for the level is made. All levels have two records which the player can try to beat: PAR (Derived from the golf scoring format) and World Record. PAR usually takes some quick doing to achieve and even changes with time in the newer versions and setting a new World Record is near impossible even for the dedicated player except through sheer luck. World Records are usually formed by groups of very dedicated players who have mastered moving the marble quickly but precisely and have known the ins and outs of each level. Score statistics are published every month at the official website of Enigma. The most important categories are World Record Statistics and Solved Level Statistics. Due to the large number of levels and the variety of challenges involved, achieving 100% level completion is no small task. According to in-game published statistics, as of December 2010 only one person has managed 100% level completion. History Since 2002, Oxyd is abandonware. That same year 2002 was the initial release of Enigma. In 2007, Enigma reached stable version 1.01. Current version is 1.21. =Development= The landscapes are generated by scripts in the Lua programming language, making the creation of complicated landscapes relatively easy. A level editor exists. Composer of the menu music 'Pentagonal Dreams' is Andrew 'Necros' Sega. Enigma does not currently support the popular cooperative two-player network games that were available with some versions of Oxyd. However, most of the two-player landscapes are playable in single-player.  Reception  Enigma has been praised in reviews as open source fan game and clone of Oxyd. Enigma was selected by Linux Format as \\"HotPick\\" in February 2007.Linux Format 089 February 2007 page 73 It is included in many Linux distributions and is distributed over various freeware outlets.

It was founded in 940 by Kanch≈ç Dais≈çj≈ç, a disciple of K≈çb≈ç Daishi. It is a lead temple in the Chisan branch (Chisan-ha Êô∫Â±±Ê¥æ) of New Shingon (Shingi Shingon Êñ∞Áæ©ÁúüË®ÄÂÆó), includes a large complex of buildings and grounds, and is one of the best-known temples in the Kant≈ç region. It is dedicated to ƒÄcala (Japanese: Fud≈ç my≈ç≈ç (\\"Unmovable Wisdom King\\")) who is usually depicted holding a sword and rope and surrounded by flames. Often called a fire god, he is associated with fire rituals. Founding The temple was established in 940 to commemorate the victory of the forces dispatched from the Heian capital to suppress a revolt by the powerful Kant≈ç region samurai, Taira no Masakado. The Shingon priest Kanch≈ç accompanied the force, bringing with him an image of Acala from the Gomad≈ç (Fire Offering Hall) of Takao-san Jingo-ji in Ky≈çt≈ç. Shingon founder K≈çb≈ç Daishi himself was said to have carved the image and used it in Goma sacred fire rituals that helped stop a rebellion during his era. The rebellion in 940 also came to an end just as Kanch≈ç completed a three-week Goma ritual with the same image. According to legend, the image of Acala became too heavy after the victory to move back to its home base, so a new temple on Narita-san, named Shinsh≈ç-ji (New Victory Temple), was built to enshrine it on the spot. The temple maintains that the original image is enshrined in the Main Hall, where it is displayed on special occasions, but art historians date the current image to no earlier than the 13th century.Graham 2007, p. 87 Expansion For over 600 years, Narita-san remained a remote, humble, provincial temple‚Äîuntil Tokugawa Ieyasu moved his capital to Edo in 1603. Ieyasu himself credited its abbot with converting him to Buddhism, and assigned the local Sakura Domain daimy≈ç to be responsible for its upkeep. The military and political success associated with the temple may also have appealed to him, and the location of the temple, protecting the unlucky northeast approach to his new capital, corresponded to the position of the head temple of the Tendai sect, Enryaku-ji, relative to the old Heian capital of Kyoto. However, the shogunate did little to support the temple until Tokugawa Ietsuna reconstructed its Main Hall in 1655. That building now serves as a calligraphy classroom.Graham 2007, pp. 87-88 Shingon founder K≈çb≈ç Daishi (K≈´kai) was famous for his Japanese calligraphy. But the person most responsible for promoting and enriching Narita-san was Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç I (1660-1704), one of the most influential actors of the golden age of kabuki. Born into a wealthy merchant family with ties to the Narita area, Danj≈´r≈ç relished his family's former samurai status by playing heroic characters doing noble deeds, developing in the process a rough, manly style known as aragoto. He was also a devout Buddhist with a particular devotion to Fud≈ç my≈ç≈ç, to whom he gave credit for the safe birth of his son Kuz≈ç, who went on to become Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç II (1688-1758). Kuz≈ç played such a ferocious and convincing Fud≈ç in his stage debut in 1697 that the audience responded with prayers and offerings as if they were before a temple deity. In 1703, Danj≈´r≈ç I wrote and starred in another play specifically about the Fud≈ç at Shinsh≈ç-ji, The Avatars of the Fud≈ç of Narita Temple, whose opening was timed to coincide with the traveling exhibit (Âá∫ÈñãÂ∏≥ degaich≈ç) of sacred images from Narita-san in Edo. Danj≈´r≈ç's immense popularity and his attachment to Fud≈ç my≈ç≈ç at Shinsh≈ç-ji prompted many commoners of all classes to make regular pilgrimages from Edo to Narita-san.Graham 2007, pp. 88-90 Important buildings Several of the structures at Narita-san temple have been designated National Important Cultural Properties: the K≈çmy≈ç-d≈ç, built in 1701 and dedicated to the Dainichi Nyorai Buddha (Vairocana), the principal image of Shingon Buddhism; the three- storied, 25-meter high pagoda built in 1712; the Ni≈çmon main gate, built in 1830; the Shaka-d≈ç (Shakyamuni Hall), built in 1858; and the Gaku-d≈ç (Votive Tablet Hall), built in 1861. The Kaizan-d≈ç (Open Mountain Hall) shrine to Kanch≈ç Dais≈çj≈ç was built in 1938, in time for the temple's 1000th anniversary.On-site signage viewed 27 June 2009. Narita-san Park (16.5 hectares) opened in 1928, the current Great Main Hall dates from 1968, a 58-meter high Great Pagoda (Dait≈ç) was added in 1984, and a hall dedicated to Prince Sh≈çtoku, regarded as the father of Japanese Buddhism, was erected in 1992. Regular events Large crowds attend the major annual events at Narita-san: Oshogatsu in January, Setsubun in February, the taiko drum festival in April, firelight performances of Noh plays in May, the Gion Festival in July, Obon in August; Shichigosan in November; and the annual burning of amulets in late December. People come to Narita-san Park to view ume blossoms in the early spring and autumn leaves in the late fall. In addition, there are chantings of the Sutra of Great Wisdom (Daihannya-e) in January, May, and September; and temple fairs are held on the 1st, 15th, and 28th day of each month. Several times a day, wooden amulets are ceremonially burned in Goma rituals. Tourism Narita-san has been a favorite site for excursions and pilgrimages by citizens of the nearby metropolitan area ever since the Tokugawa sh≈çguns moved the national capital to Edo in 1603. After nearby Narita International Airport became the primary international hub for Japanese air traffic in the late 1970s, Narita-san also began to attract increasing numbers of foreign tourists, especially those who have a long layovers in transit.

It is the senior dukedom in that Peerage (except for the Dukedom of Rothesay held by the Sovereign's eldest son), and as such its holder is the Premier Peer of Scotland, as well as being head of both the House of Hamilton and the House of Douglas. The title, the town of Hamilton in Lanarkshire, and many places around the world are named after members of the Hamilton family. The ducal family's surname, originally \\"Hamilton\\", is now \\"Douglas-Hamilton\\". Since 1711, the Dukedom has been held together with the Dukedom of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain, and the Dukes since that time have been styled Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, along with several other subsidiary titles. Overview Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, 16th Duke of Hamilton, and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hamilton The titles held by the current Duke of Hamilton and Brandon are: =Peerage of Scotland= * 16th Duke of Hamilton (created 1643) * 13th Marquess of Douglas (created 1633) * 16th Marquess of Clydesdale (created 1643) * 23rd Earl of Angus (created 1389) * 13th Earl of Angus (created 1633) * 15th Earl of Lanark (created 1639) * 16th Earl of Arran and Cambridge (created 1643) * 13th Lord Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest (created 1633) * 15th Lord Machanshyre and Polmont (created 1639) * 16th Lord Aven and Innerdale (created 1643) =Peerage of Great Britain= * 13th Duke of Brandon, in the County of Suffolk (created 1711) * 13th Baron Dutton, in the County of Chester (created 1711) =Other offices and duties= The Duke of Hamilton and Brandon is Hereditary Keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official royal residence in Scotland, where he maintains large private quarters. He is also, as Lord Abernethy and in this respect successor to the Gaelic Earls of Fife, the Hereditary Bearer of the Crown of Scotland, a role which the 15th Duke performed at the inauguration of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun01pauluoft#page/184/mode/2upMaxwell, Vol II, pp 2‚Äì7,p 17 as did the 16th Duke at the State Opening of Parliament, 30 June 2011. Traditionally, the Duke of Hamilton enjoys the exclusive right to remove the Scottish Crown Jewels from the City of Edinburgh. He also regularly attends sittings in the Court of Lord Lyon as an hereditary assessor, sitting on the bench beside Lord Lyon. =Courtesy titles= The courtesy titles used by heirs apparent are \\"Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale\\" (the eldest son of the Duke) and \\"Earl of Angus\\" (the eldest son of a Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale). No Duke has had a great-grandson in direct line to the titles, but it is likely that such an heir would be styled \\"Lord Abernethy\\" (the Lordship of Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest being the most senior available title). Before the Dukes succeeded to the Marquessate of Douglas and its subsidiary titles, the heirs apparent were styled initially \\"Earl of Arran\\" (which had previously been used as a courtesy title by the Marquesses of Hamilton) and later \\"Marquess of Clydesdale\\" (the former style then being adopted for a grandson in direct line). The heir apparent to the Earldom of Lanark (before that title merged with the Dukedom) was styled \\"Lord Polmont\\". =Multiple dukedoms= The Duke of Hamilton and Brandon is one of only five British peers to hold more than one dukedom, the others being: * the Prince of Wales (who is Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay); * the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry; * the Duke of Argyll (who holds two Dukedoms of Argyll); and * the Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon (who alone holds three dukedoms). Historically, several other peers have held multiple dukedoms, including the Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle-under-Lyne, the Duke of Argyll and Greenwich, the Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch and the two Dukes of Queensberry and Dover and some other mainly Royal Dukes. Lennoxlove House, a current seat of the Dukes of Hamilton House of Hamilton =Lairds of Cadzow= Gilbert de Hameldun is recorded as witnessing a charter confirming the gift of the church at Cragyn to the Abbey of Paisley in 1271. His ancestry is uncertain but he may have been the son of William de Hamilton (third son of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester) and Mary of Strathearn. Gilbert de Hameldun married Isabella Randolph, daughter of Thomas Randolph of Strathdon, Chamberlain of Scotland. His heir was Walter fitz Gilbert. He was governor of Bothwell Castle for the English Crown during the First War of Scottish Independence. Following the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, he gave refuge to the Earl of Hertford and other escapees, only to deliver them and Bothwell up to Edward Bruce. He then became a Bruce partisan. Sometime between 1315 and 1329, Robert the Bruce knighted him and granted him lands in Renfrewshire and the Lothians and Cadzow (present day Hamilton in Lanarkshire), including Cadzow Castle. The lands had previously belonged to John Comyn, who was murdered by Robert the Bruce. Undifferenced arms of the chief of Hamilton until 1503 The 1st laird of Cadzow was succeeded as 2nd laird by his son Sir David fitz Walter. He was a supporter of King David II and fought at the Battle of Neville's Cross (Battle of Durham) where he was captured along with the King. His son David Hamilton, the 3rd laird, was the first to establish Hamilton as the family name. David Hamilton's son Sir John Hamilton became the 4th laird and was in turn succeeded as 5th laird by his son James Hamilton. =Lords Hamilton and Earls of Arran= The 5th laird was succeeded as 6th laird by his son, Sir James Hamilton, who was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Hamilton on 3 July 1445. In early 1474, he married Princess Mary, Countess of Arran, daughter of King James II and widow of Thomas Boyd, 1st Earl of Arran. He was succeeded by his only legitimate son, James, 2nd Lord Hamilton. In 1490, then aged 15, he married the 13-year-old Elizabeth, Lady Hay, daughter of Alexander Home, 2nd Lord Home and widow of Sir Thomas Hay, Master of Yester, son and heir of John Hay, 1st Lord Hay of Yester. However, it was later discovered that Sir Thomas Hay was still alive and the marriage was annulled. The 2nd Lord married secondly Janet, Lady Livingstone, daughter of Sir David Beaton of Creich and widow of Sir Robert Livingstone of Easter Wemyss and Drumry. He became a Privy Counsellor to King James IV, and helped to arrange his marriage to Princess Margaret, daughter of King Henry VII of England. As a reward he was created Earl of Arran on 8 August 1503. He was succeeded by his elder son from his second marriage, James, 2nd Earl of Arran. He was Regent of Scotland between 1542 and 1554, and guardian of the young Mary, Queen of Scots. He was created Duc de Ch√¢tellerault in the Peerage of France in 1548 for his part in arranging the marriage of Queen Mary to Francis, Dauphin of France. This French Dukedom was forfeit when he switched allegiances in 1559. Emperor Napoleon III \\"confirmed\\" this title for the 12th Duke of Hamilton in the 19th century, but although the 12th Duke was heir male of the 2nd Earl, the legal effect of this \\"confirmation\\" is doubtful. left Coat of Arms on a Derby Porcelain dinner service commissioned by the 8th Duke of Hamilton, circa 1780‚Äì90 The 2nd Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, James, 3rd Earl of Arran, who had been proposed as a husband to Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1561. In 1562 he was declared insane, and in 1581 he resigned the Earldom to James Stewart of Bothwellhaugh. However, in 1586 his resignation was ruled by the Court of Session to be the act of a madman and his honours were restored. =Marquesses and Dukes of Hamilton= The 3rd Earl's younger brother John Hamilton (who was styled Lord Hamilton as is traditional for the younger sons of Earlshttps://www.debretts.com/expertise/essential-guide-to-the- peerage/courtesy-titles) was appointed to administer his brother's estates. He was created Marquess of Hamilton, Earl of Arran and Lord Aven on 17 April 1599. His son, James, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton (who had been created Lord Aberbrothwick (or Arbroath) on 5 May 1608, before he succeeded) moved to England with King James VI, and invested into the Somers Isles Company, an offshoot of the Virginia Company, buying the shares of Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. The Parish of Hamilton in the Somers Isles (now Bermuda) is named for him. Upon the death of his uncle in 1609 he succeeded as 4th Earl of Arran (of the 1503 creation) and 5th Lord Hamilton. He was also created Earl of Cambridge and Baron Innerdale in the Peerage of England on 16 June 1619. His son, James, 3rd Marquess of Hamilton, was created Duke of Hamilton, Marquess of Clydesdale, Earl of Arran and Cambridge and Lord Aven and Innerdale on 12 April 1643, with a special remainder allowing succession through the female line should his and his brother's heirs male fail. His son, Charles, Earl of Arran, died young and the 1st Duke's titles passed to his younger brother, William, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, who had already been created Earl of Lanark and Lord Machanshire and Polmont on 31 March 1639. A surrender and regrant in 1650 allowed these also to be inherited by the 1st Duke's elder daughter. Upon his death in 1651, with no further heirs in the immediate male line, the Dukedom (and the titles created with it), as well as the Earldom of Lanark (and the title created with it), passed to that daughter, Anne, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton. The 1503 Earldom of Arran and the Lordship of Hamilton became dormant,The heir male was James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Abercorn, grandson of the third son of the 2nd Earl of Arran. Neither he nor his successors, the Earls, Marquesses and Dukes of Abercorn, have claimed either title. and all the other titles (the Marquessate of Hamilton, the 1599 Earldom of Arran and the Lordships of Hamilton, Aven and Aberbrothwick in the Peerage of Scotland, and the Earldom of Cambridge and the Barony of Innerdale in the Peerage of England) became extinct. In 1656, the 3rd Duchess married William Douglas, 1st Earl of Selkirk, third son of William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas. He had been created Earl of Selkirk and Lord Daer and Shortcleuch on 4 August 1646. He changed his surname to \\"Hamilton\\", and on 20 September 1660 was created Duke of Hamilton, Marquess of Clydesdale, Earl of Arran, Lanark and Selkirk and Lord Aven, Machanshire, Polmont and Daer for life. In 1688, he resigned the Earldom of Selkirk and the Lordship of Daer and Shortcleuch, and those titles were regranted to his second son, with a special remainder designed to prevent them becoming merged with the Dukedom. (See Earl of Selkirk for the subsequent history of those titles, which were eventually inherited by the 12th Duke of Hamilton, becoming separated again from the Dukedom on the death of the 13th Duke in 1940). On 9 July 1698, the 3rd Duchess resigned all her titles in favour of her eldest son, James, Earl of Arran, who thereby succeeded as 4th Duke in his mother's lifetime (his father had died in 1694). During the lead up to the Acts of Union 1707, the 4th Duke was the leader of the anti-union party. He was created Duke of Brandon, in the County of Suffolk, and Baron Dutton, in the County of Chester, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 10 September 1711, but was wrongfully refused a summons to the Parliament of Great Britain under that title (although he continued to sit as a representative peer). He was killed in a celebrated duel with Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun (who also died) in Hyde Park in London on 15 November 1712. Hamilton Palace, the former family seat in Hamilton, circa 1880. The 4th Duke's son James, 5th Duke of Hamilton was succeeded by his son James, 6th Duke of Hamilton and he by his son James, 7th Duke of Hamilton. In 1761, the 7th Duke's second cousin twice removed, Archibald Douglas, 1st Duke of Douglas, died without an heir. As the Duke of Hamilton, though still using the surname \\"Hamilton\\", was patrilineally a \\"Douglas\\" (through the 3rd Duchess's husband), the 7th Duke became heir male of the House of Douglas and inherited the Duke of Douglas's subsidiary titles (although not the Dukedom), succeeding as 4th Marquess of Douglas, 14th and 4th Earl of Angus and 4th Lord Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest. He died without issue and was succeeded by his brother Douglas, 8th Duke of Hamilton. He left no sons and the title passed back to his uncle, the 6th Duke's brother, Archibald, 9th Duke of Hamilton. He was succeeded by his son Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton and then by his son William, 11th Duke of Hamilton. The 11th Duke's son William, 12th Duke of Hamilton (who changed his surname to \\"Hamilton Douglas\\") died without a male heir and the Dukedom passed to his fourth cousin Alfred, 13th Duke of Hamilton, who was descended from the 4th Duke of Hamilton and whose line of the family had adopted the surname \\"Douglas-Hamilton\\". His son was Douglas, 14th Duke of Hamilton, who was succeeded by his son Angus, 15th Duke of Hamilton. He died in 2010, and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, Alexander, 16th Duke of Hamilton. = Succession to the Dukedom of Hamilton = The letters patent that created the Dukedom of Hamilton contained a special remainder. It stipulated that the Dukedom should descend to: # heirs male of the body of the grantee, failing which to # the grantee's brother and heirs male of the body of the grantee's brother, failing which to # the grantee's eldest daughter and heirs male of her body, failing which to # nearest heirs whatsoever of the grantee. As the first Duke and his brother (the second Duke) both died without surviving sons, the succession has since 1651 been governed by the third rule given, with the dukedom going to the grantee's daughter (the third Duchess) and her heirs male. House of Douglas George Douglas, an illegitimate son of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, was created Earl of Angus on 9 April 1389. His descendant, William, 11th Earl of Angus, was created Marquess of Douglas, Earl of Angus and Lord Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest on 14 June 1633. His great-grandson, Archibald, 3rd Marquess of Douglas, was created Duke of Douglas, Marquess of Angus and Abernethy, Viscount of Jedburgh Forest and Lord Douglas of Bonkill, Prestoun and Robertoun on 10 April 1703. He died, married but childless, in 1761, at which point the Dukedom of Douglas (and the titles created with it) became extinct, but the Marquessate of Douglas, both Earldoms of Angus and the Lordship of Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest passed to his second cousin twice removed and heir male, James Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton.

Howard Carter discovered it in 1922 underneath the remains of workmen's huts built during the Ramesside Period; this explains why it was largely spared the desecration and tomb clearances at the end of the 20th Dynasty, although it was robbed and resealed twice in the period after its completion. The tomb was densely packed with items in great disarray due to its small size, the two robberies, and the apparently hurried nature of its completion. It took eight years to empty due to the state of the tomb and to Carter's meticulous recording technique. The contents were all transported to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Tutankhamun's tomb had been entered at least twice not long after his mummy was buried, and well before Carter's discovery. The outermost doors were unsealed leading into the shrines enclosing the king's nested coffins, though the inner two shrines remained intact and sealed.  Discovery of the tomb  Theodore M. Davis's team uncovered a small site containing funerary artifacts with Tutankhamun's name and some embalming parts in 1907, just before his discovery of the tomb of Horemheb. Davis erroneously assumed that this site was Tutankhamun's complete tomb and concluded the dig. The details of both findings are documented in his 1912 publication The Tombs of Harmhabi and Touat√¢nkhamanou; the book closes with the comment, \\"I fear that the Valley of the Kings is now exhausted.\\" pectoral found in the tomb Lord Carnarvon employed British Egyptologist Howard Carter to excavate the site of KV62, and in 1922 Carter returned to a line of huts that he had abandoned a few seasons earlier. The crew cleared the huts and rock debris beneath, and their young water boy, Hussein Abdel- Rassoul, stumbled on a stone which turned out to be the top of a flight of steps cut into the bedrock. Carter had the steps partially dug out until the team found the top of a mud-plastered doorway. The doorway was stamped with indistinct cartouches (oval seals with hieroglyphic writing). Carter ordered the staircase to be refilled and sent a telegram to Carnarvon, who arrived on November 23, 1922 along with his 21-year-old daughter Lady Evelyn Herbert. The excavators cleared the stairway completely, which revealed clearer seals lower down on the door bearing the name of Tutankhamun. However, further examination showed that the door blocking had been breached and resealed on at least two occasions. Clearing the blocking led to a downward corridor that was completely blocked with packed limestone chippings, through which a robbers' tunnel had been excavated and anciently refilled. At the end of the tunnel was a second sealed door that had been breached and resealed in antiquity. Carter then made a hole in the door and used a candle to check for foul gases before looking inside. \\"At first I could see nothing,\\" he wrote, \\"the hot air escaping from the chamber causing the candle flame to flicker, but presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold ‚Äì everywhere the glint of gold.\\" After a pause, Carnarvon asked, \\"Can you see anything?\\" Carter replied, \\"Yes, wonderful things.\\" =Investigation= Plan of KV62 Carter's team opened the tomb on November 29, 1922, and they made the first announcement and press conference the next day. They removed the first item from the tomb on December 27. On February 16, 1923, the team opened the burial chamber. On February 12, 1924, the team raised the granite lid of the sarcophagus. In February 1924 a dispute, caused by what Carter saw as excessive control by the Antiquities Service, led to a suspension of the excavation for nearly a year, with Carter leaving for a lecture tour in the United States. The Egyptian authorities eventually agreed that Carter should complete the tomb's clearance, and in January 1925 Carter returned. On October 13 the lid of the outermost coffin was removed. Carter opened the second coffin on October 23, and the team removed the lid of the innermost coffin on October 28, revealing the mummy. They began examining the remains of Tutankhamun on November 11. They began work in the treasury on October 24, 1926, and emptied and examined the annex between October 30 and December 15, 1927. They removed the last objects from the tomb on November 10, 1930, eight years after the discovery. The time taken to clear the tomb reflects Carter‚Äôs methodical approach in carefully recording, assessing and cataloguing each item before its removal. This included photographing each item, both in the position found and individually, a task undertaken mainly by Harry Burton, loaned to Carter by the Metropolitan Museum's excavation team. Layout of tomb The tomb's design suggests that it was originally intended for a private individual, not for royalty. There is some evidence that it was adapted for a royal occupant during its excavation. This may be supported by the fact that only the burial chamber walls were decorated, unlike royal tombs in which nearly all walls were painted with scenes from the netherworld books. Axonometric, plan, and elevation images of KV62 taken from a 3D model =Staircase= Sixteen steps descend from a small, level platform to the first doorway which was sealed and plastered, although it had been penetrated by grave robbers at least twice in antiquity. =Entrance corridor= Beyond the first doorway, a descending corridor leads to the second sealed door and into the room that Carter described as the antechamber. This was used originally to hold material left over from the funeral, and material associated with embalming the king. After an initial robbery, this material was moved either into the tomb proper or to KV54, and the corridor was sealed with packed limestone chippings which covered some debris from the first robbery. A later robbery broke through the outer door and excavated a tunnel through the chippings to the second door. The robbery was discovered and the second door was resealed, the tunnel refilled, and the outer door sealed again. Some remnants in the corridor appear to have been from a funerary meal matching one discovered by Davis in jars in KV54, which indicates that KV54 may have been used as a store for items recovered after the first resealing of the tomb. Carter said that he found the Head of Nefertem in this section.Zahi Hawass: King Tutankhamun. The Treasures Of The Tomb. p. 16. Stereo drawing of tomb viewed from northwest =Antechamber= The undecorated antechamber was found in a state of \\"organized chaos\\", partly due to ransacking during the robberies. It contained approximately 700 objects (articles 14 to 171 in the Carter catalogue) among which were three funeral beds, one in the form of a lion (the goddess Sekhmet), one in the shape of a spotted cow (representing Mehet-Weret), and one the form of a composite animal with the body of a lion, the tail of a hippopotamus, and the head of a crocodile (representing the corpse-devourer Ammit). Perhaps the most remarkable item in this room were the stacked components of four chariots, one of which was possibly used for hunting, one for war, and another two for parades. A large chest was found to contain military items, walking sticks, the king's underwear, and a copper alloy trumpet, one of two found in the tomb and the oldest known functioning brass instruments in the world. =Burial chamber= The outer golden shrine, now on display in the Cairo Museum Decoration This is the only decorated chamber in the tomb, with scenes from the opening of the mouth ceremony (showing Ay, Tutankhamun's successor acting as the king's son, despite being older than he is) and Tutankhamun with the goddess Nut on the north wall, the twelve hours of Amduat (on the west wall), spell one of the Book of the Dead (on the east wall) and representations of the king with various deities (Anubis, Isis, Hathor and others now destroyed) on the south wall. The north wall shows Tutankhamen being followed by his Ka, being welcomed to the underworld by Osiris. Cross-section of shrines, sarcophagus, and coffins in the burial chamber Some of the treasures in Tutankhamun's tomb are noted for their apparent departure from traditional depictions of the boy king. Certain cartouches where a king's name should appear have been altered, as if to reuse the property of a previous pharaoh‚Äîhas often occurred. However, this instance may simply be the product of \\"updating\\" the artifacts to reflect the shift from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun. Other differences are less easy to explain, such as the older, more angular facial features of the middle coffin and canopic coffinettes. The most widely accepted theory for these latter variations is that the items were originally intended for Smenkhkare, who may or may not be the mysterious KV55 mummy. This mummy, according to craniological examinations, bears a striking first-order (father-to-son, brother-to-brother) relationship to Tutankhamun. Contents The right side walls of the shrines and the sarcophagus Tutankhamun's wooden chest Lower and Upper Egypt The entire chamber was occupied by four gilded wooden shrines which surrounded the king's sarcophagus. The outer shrine measured 5.08 √ó 3.28 √ó 2.75 m and 32 mm thick, almost entirely filling the room, with only 60 cm at either end and less than 30 cm on the sides. Outside of the shrines were 11 paddles for the \\"solar boat\\", containers for scents, and lamps decorated with images of the god Hapi. The fourth and innermost shrine was 2.90 m long and 1.48 m wide. The wall decorations depict the king's funeral procession, and Nut was painted on the ceiling, \\"embracing\\" the sarcophagus with her wings. This sarcophagus was constructed in quartzite with a lid of rose granite tinted to match. It appears to have been constructed for another owner, but then recarved for Tutankhamun; the identity of the original owner is not preserved. In each corner a protective goddess (Isis, Nephthys, Serket and Neith) guards the body. Inside, the king's body was placed within three mummiform coffins, the outer two made of gilded wood while the innermost was composed of of pure gold. Tutankhamun's mummy was adorned with a gold mask, mummy bands and other funerary items. The funerary mask is made of gold, inlaid with lapis lazuli, carnelian, quartz, obsidian, turquoise and glass and faience, and weighs .Alessandro Bongioanni & Maria Croce (ed.), The Treasures of Ancient Egypt: From the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Universe Publishing, a division of Ruzzoli Publications Inc., 2003. p. 310 =Funerary text= The Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld is a two-part ancient Egyptian funerary text inscribed on the second shrine of the sarcophagus. The term \\"enigmatic\\" here refers to it being written in cryptographic code, a New Kingdom practice also known from the tombs of Ramesses IX and Ramesses V. Its content is therefore not readily available to Egyptology; Coleman (2004) interprets it in terms of the creation and rebirth of the sun. The text is broken into three sections that incorporate other funerary texts, such as the Book of the Dead and the Amduat. / . The text is notable for containing the first known depiction of the ouroboros symbol, in the form of two serpents (interpreted as manifestations of the deity Mehen) encircling the head and feet of a god, taken to represent the unified Ra-Osiris. =Treasury= The treasury was the burial chamber's only side-room and was accessible by an unblocked doorway. It contained over 5,000 catalogued objects, most of them funerary and ritual in nature. The two largest objects found in this room were the king's elaborate canopic chest and a large statue of Anubis. Other items included numerous shrines containing gilded statuettes of the king and deities, model boats and two more chariots. This room also held the mummies of two fetusesCarter, Howard. The Tomb of Tutankhamen, 1972 ed, Barrie & Jenkins, p. 189, that DNA testing has shown to have been stillborn offspring of the king. =Annex= The annex, originally used to store oils, ointments, scents, foods and wine, was the last room to be cleared, from the end of October 1927 to the spring of 1928. Although small in size, it contained approximately 280 groups of objects, totaling more than 2,000 individual pieces. Also found within the annex chamber were 26 jars containing wine residue. =Robberies= During the excavation it quickly became apparent that the tomb had been robbed in ancient times. The upper part of the door leading into the tomb had been damaged and repaired, with the symbol of the Royal Necropolis affixed. Behind it was a corridor carved through the bedrock filled with limestone chippings, which seemed to have been tunnelled through. A second door had also been penetrated and repaired at some point. Parts of absent objects and traces of oils in empty jars led Carter to conclude that the tomb had been raided for gold shortly after Tutankhamun's burial, and again for expensive oils. The corridor had presumably been filled with debris after the first robbery, as the inner plaster door lacked the marking of the chippings that the repaired area demonstrated, indicating that it had dried before its placement. This debris had been tunneled through in a later robbery. The chippings also covered some fragments of looted articles including jar lids, razors and wood fragments that had been presumably removed from the antechamber and stored in the tunnel during the first robbery. Two sealed chambers leading from the antechamber‚Äîthe annex and the burial chamber‚Äîhad also been raided. The annex was probably the worst affected by the first robbery. The room was small and full of densely packed items, which had been ransacked by a robber who had entered through a small hole in the outer door. The robber hurriedly disturbed the contents of the annex, emptied boxes and removed items. The robbers seem to have been looking for metals, glass (then a valuable commodity), cloth, oils and cosmetics. The robbery was fairly contemporary with the burial, as the lifespan of oils and cosmetics would have been limited. After this robbery was discovered, the doors were resealed and it is likely that the descending tunnel was filled with packed limestone chippings to deter future robberies. The second robbery required much more organisation to clear the descending corridor‚Äîa tunnel was dug in the top-left-hand corner of the tunnel, and the outer door was penetrated by a large hole in the blocking. Carter estimated that it would have taken a team of men around eight hours to excavate the tunnel by passing back baskets of rubble. The second robbery penetrated the entire tomb, and Carter estimated that around 60% of the jewelry in the treasury had been looted, along with precious metals. At some point, a knotted scarf containing a number of looted rings was dropped back into a box in the antechamber, which led Carter to the conclusion that the robbery had perhaps been discovered while it was in progress, or that the thieves had been pursued and caught. The tomb may have been hurriedly resealed (possibly to avoid drawing attention to the tomb) by the official Maya, as the signature of his assistant Djehutymose was found by Carter on a calcite stand in the annex. Upon resealing the tomb, the first and second resealings were marked with the same seal, bearing a design of a jackal over nine bound captives, which may indicate that they both took place within a short time interval after the closure of the tomb. =Possible undiscovered chambers= Research by Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves (attached to the University of Arizona) suggested, in 2015, that there may be areas of the tomb worthy of further analysis. Reeves investigated high-resolution digital scans of the tomb taken by Madrid-based company Factum Arte that were used in the process of creating a facsimile of the tomb. Reeves noted markings in the plaster of the burial chamber that appeared to suggest the possibility of a small door in the west wall of the burial chamber, of the same dimensions as the annex door. According to Reeves, markings on the north wall could also suggest that the wall itself may partly be a blocking wall covering a void, possibly indicating that the \\"antechamber\\" continues as a corridor beyond the north wall. Although the \\"doors\\" may just be uncompleted construction work, one possibility that has been suggested is that Tutankhamun is actually buried in the outer section of a larger tomb complex (similar to the tomb of Amenhotep III) that has been sealed off by the north wall, and that a further burial (possibly that of Nefertiti) may exist elsewhere in undiscovered areas of the tomb. In November 2015, a ground-penetrating radar scan was conducted by Hirokatsu Watanabe, a Japanese radar expert. His results appeared to confirm Reeves' hypothesis, indicating that there were voids behind the west and north walls of the burial chamber. A second GPR scan could not replicate Watanabe's findings. A third scan was carried out by researchers from the Polytechnic University of Turin, the University of Turin, and two private companies, which found no evidence of any hidden chambers, thereby disproving Reeves' hypothesis. They concluded that the initial positive result was likely caused by reflections of the walls themselves, or even interference from the sarcophagus. The Egyptian Ministry of State of Antiquities reviewed and accepted these results, which were presented in May 2018. Nicholas Reeves, in 2019, reviewed and extended his original hypothesis, including a review of the available geophysical data by geophysicist and radar expert George Ballard. This includes not only the three radar scans, but correlates these with the ERT results published earlier by the same research team from the Polytechnic University of Turin and the University of Turin. Ballard agreed that no open chambers or spaces had been located immediately behind the walls, but observed that the radar data from the zone behind the North and Treasury walls was more consistent with a rubble fill, indicative of a possible anthropic origin, rather than natural rock. The location in the ERT data of two isolated resistivity anomalies consistent with voided spaces, close to the same level as KV 62, but separated from it, raises the possibility that there is a back filled passageway behind the walls leading to further chambers. This analysis is supportive of Reeves' original hypothesis, and contradicts the conclusion, accepted previously by the Ministry of Antiquities, drawn by Porcelli et al. =Meteorite dagger= A 2016 study suggested that the dagger buried with Tutankhamun was made from an iron meteorite, with similar proportions of metals (iron, nickel and cobalt) to one discovered near and named after Kharga Oasis.King Tutankhamun buried with dagger made of space iron, study finds, ABC News Online, 2 June 2016 Present day KV62 in the Valley of the Kings. The tomb directly facing the camera is that of Rameses VI. In front of it and to the right, half-hidden by the shoulder of the central mountain, is the tomb of Tutankhamun. The tomb is open to the public at an additional charge to that of general admission to the Valley of the Kings. The number of visitors was limited to 400 per day in 2008. A project for the conservation and management of the tomb was undertaken by the Getty Conservation Institute. In 2009, Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation began work on a replica of the tomb, which was opened about a mile from the original in 2014. The Getty Conservation Institute completed its work in 2019, marking the most significant conservation project on the tomb to date.

Scholastic Parents Media Scholastic Parents Media publishes the Scholastic Parent & Child magazine. The group also specializes in online advertising sales and custom programs designed for parents with children aged 0‚Äì6. Criticism In July 2005, Scholastic determined that certain leases previously accounted for as operating leases should have been accounted for as capital leases. The cumulative effect, if recorded in the current year, would be material. As a result, it decided to restate its financial statements. Scholastic has been criticized for inappropriately marketing to children. Also, Scholastic now requires parents to submit children's names with birth dates to place online orders, creating controversy. A significant number of titles carried have strong media tie-ins and are considered relatively short in literary and artistic merit by some critics. Consumer groups have also attacked Scholastic for selling too many toys and video games to children, rather than focusing on just books.

It belonged to the sons of Ramesses II. Though KV5 was partially excavated as early as 1825, its true extent was discovered in 1995 by Kent R. Weeks and his exploration team. The tomb is now known to be the largest in the Valley of the Kings. Weeks' discovery is widely considered the most dramatic in the valley since the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. History Standing near the entrance to the Valley, KV5 was robbed in antiquity.Kent R. Weeks, The Lost Tomb. New York: William Morrow, 1998. In addition, over the centuries, it suffered the fate of other low-lying tombs, which was to be filled with rubble washed down in the flash floods that accompany thunderstorms over the Valley. The tomb was examined several times once exploration of the Valley in relatively modern times started, first in 1825 (by James Burton), and later in 1902 (by Howard Carter, discoverer of the tomb of Tutankhamun, who used KV5 only as a dumping ground). However, they were not able to penetrate past the first few rooms, and thus saw nothing unusual about the tomb. Plan of KV5 It was not until the Theban Mapping Project, under Kent R. Weeks, decided to clear the tomb (in part to see if it would be damaged by proposed building works nearby, and in part so that it could be mapped) that the stage was set for the discovery of its true extent and nature. Although the works had begun in 1987, the first substantial finding came in 1995, after extensive clearing in the outer chambers of the tomb: approximately 70 rooms, lined along long corridors, running back into the hillside. The number of rooms corresponds roughly to the number of sons the pharaoh sired. This discovery caused a worldwide sensation and reignited popular interest in Egyptology. Findings so far include thousands of potshards, ushabti, faience beads, hieratic ostraca, glass vials, inlays and a large statue of Osiris, the god of the afterlife. Further excavations have revealed that the tomb is even larger than was first thought, as it contains more corridors, with more rooms, branching off from previously discovered parts of the tomb. At least 130 rooms or chambers have been discovered as of 2006 (only about 7% of which have been cleared), and work is still continuing on clearing the rest of the tomb. Located near the tomb of Ramesses II, KV7, this tomb contained most of his children, both male and female, in particular those who died in his lifetime. The skull fragments of Amun-her-khepeshef, among others, were found inside and reconstructed. Further reading * Kent R. Weeks, The Lost Tomb. New York: William Morrow, 1998.

They feature the antics of Ms. Valerie Frizzle and her class, who board a sentient anthropomorphic Type A school bus which takes them on field trips to impossible locations, including the solar system, clouds, the past, and the human body. The books are written in the first person from the point of view of an unnamed student in \\"the Friz's\\" class. The class has a pet lizard named Liz, who accompanies the class on their field trips. Since the Magic School Bus books present scientific facts in the form of stories in which fantastic things happen (for example, the bus turns into a spaceship, or children shrink to the size of blood cells), each book has a page at the end detailing in a humorous manner which parts of the book represented scientific fact and which were fanciful storytelling.  History  Craig Walker, vice-president and senior editorial director at Scholastic Co., stated that the concept began with the idea of combining science with fictional stories, and Joanna Cole (who had written both science and humor before) and Bruce Degen were then approached with creating such a series. Walker also states that his own memories of school field trips and of a teacher he had once, served as further inspiration. The first book \\"At the Waterworks\\" was written in 1985 and published the following year. Cole and Degen started a new series called Ms. Frizzle's Adventures in 2001, which teaches social studies. There are now three books in that series. Microsoft Home started publishing Magic School Bus software in 1994. Scholastic Entertainment, the American Meteorological Society and the Children's Museum of Houston created a Scholastics the Magic School Bus Kicks Up a Storm, a . traveling exhibit funded in part by the National Science Foundation, which premiered at the Children's Museum of Houston in 2003 (a copy of it opened in New Jersey the month after that).  Characters  In the original books (the original series books), Ms. Frizzle's class had a larger number of students (or \\"characters\\") and consisted of Tim, Arnold, Ralph (changed to \\"Ralphie\\" on the show and later books in this series), Dorothy Ann, Wanda, Phoebe, John, Carmen, Gregory, Amanda-Jane, Florrie, Shirley, Michael, Phil, Molly, Rachel, Alex, Carlos, and Keesha (19 students). Phoebe was first introduced in the 1987 book, The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth (in the classic series books). Carlos and Keesha were added in the 1994 book, The Magic School Bus In the Time of Dinosaurs (making it their first appearance in the classic series). The homework assignments of all the students (main characters) were seen in the books (the book series). However, in the video game series (only the games from the original software), homework assignments (referred to as \\"reports\\" in the games) were presented by all the main characters (like in the book series). In the TV series (and the TV tie in books), these assignments were included in early episodes and were instead usually presented by Dorothy Ann (unlike the book and video game series).

At least that is what they think until they discover how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises up in the air and into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud. *The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth (, 1987) **Theme: geology **Ms Frizzle's class is starting a unit on geology and for homework every student has to find a rock, and bring it to school. The next day every child except Phil has an excuse, so Ms Frizzle decides to take the class on a field trip to collect rocks. The class starts digging until they, with the help of the magic bus, dig all the way through the center of Earth. They collect many rocks and learn about the different types. Phoebe Terese first appears in this book as the \\"new kid\\". Before the show was even in production, the Magic School Bus appeared on PBS, because this book was featured on Reading Rainbow. *The Magic School Bus Inside the Human Body (, 1989) **Theme: the human body **Ms Frizzle's class is going to the museum to see an exhibit on the human body. However they stop for lunch at a park and Arnold takes too long to eat. When Ms Frizzle tries to hit the horn to tell him to hurry, she \\"accidentally\\" pushes a strange little button on the dashboard and the class finds itself inside a human body, but they are unaware that it is Arnold's. They go through the digestive system and brain and out through the nose. *The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System (, 1990) **Theme: the solar system **Arnold's know-it-all cousin Janet, is coming on the field trip this time. They are going to the planetarium to see a show about the solar system, but it is closed for repairs. On the way back to school, they blast off and fly into outer space. They visit all the planets and learn about them, but in the asteroid belt, they lose Ms Frizzle and find themselves lost in space. The rocket bus featured in this book has become a symbol of the Magic School Bus series. *The Magic School Bus On the Ocean Floor (, 1992) **Theme: the ocean **Ms Frizzle's class is learning about the ocean. It is really hot and the children just want a break. They are thrilled when she says they will take a trip to the ocean. However, when she gets to the beach she starts to drive into the water and they realise that when Ms Frizzle says \\"ocean\\" she means \\"ocean\\". Believing the bus is in trouble, Lenny the Lifeguard decides to try to save the children and instead finds himself accompanying them on the field trip. *The Magic School Bus In the Time of the Dinosaurs (, 1994) **Theme: dinosaurs **The children are turning their classroom into Dinosaur Land for Parents' Night, as they are studying dinosaurs. Ms Frizzle receives a letter from an old high school friend who is now a paleontologist and she decides to take the class on a trip to the dig. When she discovers that they are missing the bones of some Maiasaurs, she turns the bus into a time machine to travel back to the age of dinosaurs to find the bones. The class sees dinosaurs and learns the name of the different periods of the era and other information. This is the first time Ms Frizzle's first name is mentioned, and it is the first appearance of Carlos Ramon and Keesha Franklin, although Keesha was first seen in The Magic School Bus: On the Ocean Floor. *The Magic School Bus Inside a Hurricane (, 1995) **Theme: weather **The class is going to the weather station to learn about weather. However, on the way there the bus turns into a hot air balloon. Eventually they find themselves inside a hurricane. Ms Frizzle's radio proves an annoyance to Arnold in this book, as it seems to know his name. *The Magic School Bus Inside a Beehive (1996) **Theme: bees **The class is now learning about insects and Ms Frizzle is taking her class on a trip to meet a beekeeper, but they beat the beekeeper there. While they are waiting, Ms Frizzle accidentally pushes a small lever which turns the bus into a tiny beehive and the class (including Ms Frizzle) into bees. They explore the hive and learn about bees, but can they save the hive from a bear? *The Magic School Bus and the Electric Field Trip (1998) **Theme: electricity ** The children in Ms Frizzle's class were sure that there was nobody like her, but that was before they met her niece, Dottie Frizzle. Dottie accompanies the class on their field trip to the town power plant. There the bus turns into a dump truck, and pours the children into the plant. They shrink and travel through the Walkerville electric system. *The Magic School Bus Explores the Senses (1999) **Theme: the five senses **The class is learning about the senses and they are going to sing a song for an important teacher meeting. However, Ms Frizzle's personality and clothes make the class forget. Ms Frizzle thinks the meeting is tomorrow, but it is really today. So Mr Wilde, the assistant principal, decides to catch her so he can tell her about the meeting. He decides to get in a bus that just happens to be the magic school bus. The class decides to accompany him. They cannot let him drive that bus, not all by himself. Mr Wilde accidentally shrinks the bus and soon he and the class find themselves on a trip exploring the senses. Mr Wilde soon becomes obsessed with driving the bus and forgets all about finding Ms Frizzle, but the class does not. Ms Frizzle's mother appears in this book. *The Magic School Bus and the Science Fair Expedition (; 2006) **Theme: famous scientists in history **The first MSB book since 1999, The Magic School Bus celebrated its 20th anniversary with this new book published on 1 August 2006. Ms. Frizzle and her class have to find projects to display at the Walkerville Science Fair, and fast. They decide to consult with famous scientists in history like Louis Pasteur, George Washington Carver, Charles Darwin, Marie Curie, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, even Albert Einstein. All the original characters are in this book. *The Magic School Bus and the Climate Challenge (; 2010) **Theme: climate change **Ms. Frizzle takes the class on a flight in the bus over the arctic, showing them how the polar ice caps have melted since Ms. Frizzle's old copy of Our Wonderful World was published. They travel around the earth, observing the impacts of global warming and alternative energy sources. Returning to their home town, Ms. Frizzle gives the class special goggles to observe the greenhouse-gas molecules in the air. When the students return to school, they discuss things people can do to save energy and reduce carbon emissions.

Another miniature (not pictured) features his second wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, with the rest of his children Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland Earl Marshal (c. 136421 October 1425), was an English nobleman of the House of Neville. Origins Ralph Neville was born about 1364, the son of John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby by his wife and Maud Percy (d.1379), a daughter of Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy of Alnwick, Northumberland, by his wife Idoine de Clifford, a daughter of Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. Neville had a younger brother, and five sisters:; . *Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall, who married Joan Furnival. Father of Maud Neville, 6th Baroness Furnivall, wife of John Talbot, 7th Baron Talbot. *Lady Alice Neville, who married William Deincourt, 3rd Lord Deincourt *Lady Maud Neville, who married Sir William le Scrope *Lady Idoine Neville *Lady Eleanor Neville, who married Ralph Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley. *Lady Elizabeth Neville, who became a nun. Neville's father married secondly, before 9 October 1381, Elizabeth Latimer (died 5 November 1395), daughter of William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer. By his father's second marriage Neville had a brother and sister of the half blood:; . *John Neville, 6th Baron Latimer (c. 138210 December 1430), who married firstly, Maud Clifford (died c. 26 August 1446), daughter of Thomas Clifford, 6th Baron Clifford, whom he divorced before 1413‚Äì17, and by whom he had no issue. She married secondly, Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, beheaded 5 August 1415 for his part in the Southampton Plot.. *Lady Elizabeth Neville, who married Sir Thomas Willoughby. Career Neville's first military service was in Brittany under King Richard II's uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, who knighted him at Saint-Omer in July 1380. On 14 November 1381 he and his cousin, Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy, were commissioned to preside over a duel between an Englishman and a Scot, and on 1 December 1383 he and his father were commissioned to receive from the Scots 24,000 marks for the ransom of King David. On 26 October 1385 he was appointed joint Governor of Carlisle with Sir Thomas Clifford, and on 27 March 1386 was appointed, together with Clifford, joint Warden of the West March.; ; . Neville inherited the title at the age of 24 after his father's death on 17 October 1388, and was summoned to Parliament from 6 December 1389 to 30 November 1396 by writs directed to Radulpho de Nevyll de Raby. On 25 October 1388 he was appointed, with others, to survey the fortifications on the Scottish border, and on 24 May 1389 was made keeper for life of the royal forests north of the Trent. In 1393 and 1394 he was employed in peace negotiations with Scotland.; ; . In 1397 Neville supported King Richard's proceedings against Thomas of Woodstock and the Lords Appellant, and by way of reward was created Earl of Westmorland on 29 September of that year. However his loyalty to the King was tested shortly thereafter. His first wife, Margaret Stafford, had died on 9 June 1396, and Neville's second marriage to Joan Beaufort before 29 November 1396 made him the son-in-law of King Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Thus, when King Richard banished John of Gaunt's eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, on 16 September 1398, and confiscated Bolingbroke's estates after John of Gaunt's death on 3 February 1399, Westmorland was moved to support his brother-in-law. Bolingbroke landed with a small force at Ravenspur in July 1399. Westmorland and the Earl of Northumberland were in the deputation at the Tower which received King Richard's abdication, and Westmorland bore the small sceptre called the \\"virge\\" at Bolingbroke's coronation as King Henry IV on 13 October 1399.; ; ; . For his support of the new King, Westmorland was rewarded with a lifetime appointment as Earl Marshal on 30 September 1399 (although he resigned the office in 1412), a lifetime grant of the honour of Richmond on 20 October (although the grant was not accompanied by a grant of the title Earl of Richmond), and several wardships.; ; . Before 4 December he was appointed to the King's council. In March 1401, Westmorland was one of the commissioners who conducted negotiations for a marriage between the King's eldest daughter, Blanche of England, and Louis, son of Rupert, King of the Romans, and in 1403 was made a Knight of the Garter, taking the place left vacant by the death of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York. According to Tuck, Westmorland had little influence on the Scottish borders in the first years of Henry IV's reign, where the wardenships of the marches were monopolised by the Percys, leading to a growing rivalry between the two families. However, in 1403 the Percys, spurred on by various grievances, took up arms against the King, and suffered defeat at the Battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403. Northumberland's son, Henry Percy (\\"Hotspur\\"), was slain at Shrewsbury, and Northumberland's brother, the Earl of Worcester, was beheaded two days later. After Shrewsbury, King Henry ordered Westmorland to raise troops and prevent Northumberland's army, which was still in the north, from advancing south. On 6 August 1403,as a reward for his service in driving Northumberland back to Warkworth Castle, Westmorland was granted the wardenship of the West March which Northumberland had held since 1399, the wardenship of the East March, formerly held by Hotspur, being granted to the King's 14-year-old son, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford. Two years later Northumberland, joined by Lord Bardolf, again took up arms against the King. It had been Northumberland's plan to capture the earl by surprise at the outset, and in early May 1405, with 400 men, Northumberland made a surprise attack at the castle of Witton-le-Wear, where he had been staying. The attempt failed, as Westmorland had already fled. The earl speedily gathered an army, defeated a force of Percy allies at Topcliffe, and then marched towards York with Henry IV's son, John of Lancaster, to confront a force of some 8000 men gathered on Shipton Moor under the leadership of Archbishop Richard Scrope, Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk, and Scrope's nephew, Sir William Plumpton. Outnumbered by Scrope's forces, Westmorland resorted to trickery,According to contemporary writers, Westmorland tricked Scrope into surrendering; however the later Otterbourne chronicler states that Scrope and his allies surrendered voluntarily (see Tait, 1894, p. 277). and led Scrope and his allies to believe that their demands would be accepted and their personal safety guaranteed. Once Scrope's army had been disbanded on 29 May, Scrope, Mowbray and Plumpton were arrested, summarily condemned to death for treason, and beheaded outside the walls of York on 8 June 1405. Although Westmorland handed Scrope and his allies over to the King at Pontefract, he played no role in their hasty and irregular trial and execution, having been sent north by the King on 4 June to seize Northumberland's castles. It is unclear whether Northumberland had initially planned to rebel openly in concert with Scrope, but in the event he gave Scrope no support, and fled to Scotland after his failed attempt to capture Westmorland. His estates were subsequently forfeited to the crown, and Ralph, earl of Westmorland, as a reward for his quelling of the 1405 rebellion without significant bloodshed, received a large grant of former Percy lands in Cumberland and Northumberland in June 1405.; ; . After the death of Henry IV Westmorland was mainly engaged in the defence of the northern border in his capacity as Warden of the West March (1403‚Äì1414). In 1415 he decisively defeated an invading Scottish army at the Battle of Yeavering. Westmorland played no part in King Henry V's French campaigns, and Tuck notes that his relationship with Henry V was not close, perhaps partly because of the involvement of Westmorland's son-in-law, Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton, in the Southampton Plot.. After Henry V's death, Westmorland was a member of the Council of Regency during the minority of King Henry VI.. According to Tait, Westmorland was \\"no inconsiderable builder\\", citing his rebuilding of Sheriff Hutton Castle on a scale so magnificent that Leland saw \\"no house in the north so like a princely lodging\\", his doubling of the entrance gateway of Raby Castle and the corresponding tower, and possibly his responsibility for the \\"tall and striking tower\\" of Richmond parish church. On 1 November 1410 Westmorland was granted licence to found a college for a master, six clerks, six \\"decayed gentlemen\\" and others at Staindrop, towards the completion of which he left a bequest in his will. He was probably responsible for the building of Penrith castle in Cumberland c. 1412‚Äì13.Perriam, D.R., 'William Strickland's Tower in Penrith: Penrith Castle or Hutton Hall?' The English Heritage Historical Review, vol.3 no.1 (1 June 2008), p.41 Marriages and issue Ralph Neville married twice and had 22 children: =First marriage= He married firstly Margaret Stafford (died 9 June 1396), the eldest daughter of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford by his wife Philippa Beauchamp, a daughter of Thomas Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick (by his wife Katherine Mortimer, the daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March).; ; .

Death, burial, and succession Westmorland died on 21 October 1425 and was buried in the choir of his Collegiate Church of St. Mary at Staindrop. The magnificent alabaster tomb with effigies of himself and his two wives there has been termed the finest sepulchral monument in the north of England. Neither of his wives is buried with him. His first wife, Margaret Stafford, was buried at Brancepeth, County Durham, while his second wife, Joan Beaufort, was buried with her mother under a stone canopy in the sanctuary of Lincoln Cathedral.; ; . Westmorland was predeceased by his eldest son Sir John Neville (c.1387-1420), and was succeeded in the title by his grandson (the latter's son) Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland (1406-1484).. Shakespeare and Westmorland Westmorland is portrayed in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2, and Henry V. In the opening scene of Henry IV, Part 1, Westmorland is presented historically as an ally of King Henry IV against the Percys, and in the final scenes of the play as being dispatched to the north of England by the King after the Battle of Shrewsbury to intercept the Earl of Northumberland. In Act IV of Henry IV, Part 2, Westmorland is portrayed historically as having been principally responsible for quelling the Percy rebellion in 1405 by Archbishop Scrope almost without bloodshed by successfully parleying with the rebels on 29 May 1405 at Shipton Moor. However, in Henry V Westmorland is unhistorically alleged to have resisted the arguments made in favour of war with France by Archbishop Chichele in the Parliament which began at Leicester on 30 April 1414. Following Hall and Holinshed, Shakespeare attributes these arguments to Chichele. at a time when Chichele was not yet formally Archbishop, although he had been appointed by the King immediately following the death of Archbishop Arundel on 14 February 1414. Moreover, it is said that the Parliamentary rolls do not record Chichele's presence, and according to Tait the question of war with France was not discussed. In addition, Westmorland's speech urging the advantages of war against Scotland rather than France is said to be adapted from a work by the Scottish historian, John Major, who was not born until half a century after the 1414 Parliament. The First Folio text of Henry V also unhistorically gives these lines to Westmorland on the eve of Agincourt: O that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today. (Henry V, IV.iii) Westmorland was not with King Henry V on the 1415 campaign in France. On 17 April 1415 he was appointed to the Council of Regency which was to govern England under the King's brother, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, during the King's absence in France, with special responsibility for the Scottish Marches.; . In the first quarto text of the play, the foregoing lines are assigned to the Earl of Warwick.

The term can also mean code inserted into modern software for the purpose of maintaining an older or previously supported feature for example supporting a serial interface even though many modern systems do not have a serial port. It may also be in the form of supporting older file formats that may have been encoding in non-ASCII characters, such as EBCDIC. In practice, most source code has some dependency on the platform for which it is designed even if a programmer uses a platform-independent programming language like Java, it is hard to write a large, useful program that is totally independent of its environment. When the manufacturer upgrades a platform (or the platform is superseded), the code may no longer work without changes, and becomes legacy code. A large part of the task of a software engineer is to continually alter code to prevent this. While the term usually refers to source code, it can also apply to executable code that no longer runs on a later version of a system, or requires a compatibility layer to do so. An example would be a classic Macintosh application which will not run natively on Mac OS X, but runs inside the Classic environment, or a Win16 application running on Windows XP using the Windows on Windows feature in XP. Modern interpretations More recently, the software engineering community has developed other interpretations for the term legacy code. Among the most prevalent are source code inherited from someone else and source code inherited from an older version of the software. Eli Lopian, CEO of Typemock, has defined it as \\"code that developers are afraid to change\\". Michael FeathersMichael Feathers' Working Effectively with Legacy Code () introduced a definition of legacy code as code without tests, which reflects the perspective of legacy code being difficult to work with in part due to a lack of automated regression tests. He also defined characterization tests to start putting legacy code under test. Ginny Hendry characterized creation of code as a challenge to current coders to create code that is \\"like other legacies in our lives‚Äîlike the antiques, heirlooms, and stories that are cherished and lovingly passed down from one generation to the next. What if legacy code was something we took pride in?\\".Ginny Hendry 'Take Pride in Your Legacy (Code)' (https://8thlight.com/blog/ginny-hendry/2014/07/11/take-pride-in-your-legacy- code.html) See also * Legacy system References Legacy systems ","title":"Legacy code"},{"id":"290033","text":"Li Lu (born April 6, 1966) is a Chinese-born American investor and hedge fund manager. He is the founder and Chairman of Himalaya Capital Management. He was one of the student leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests, an experience he recounted in a 1990 book, Moving the Mountain: My Life in China, that was the basis of a 1994 documentary by Michael Apted. Early Life & Protests Li Lu was born and grew up in Tangshan, China. He was a survivor of 1976 Tangshan earthquake. In 1985, he went to Nanjing University, majored in Physics but later transferred to Economics. In 1989, he participated in the Tiananmen Square student protests and became one of the student leaders. He helped organize the students and participated in a hunger strike. He fled the PRC through Operation Yellowbird.Lee, Samson; Wong, Natalie (July 12, 2011) \\"Praise for Brit agents who helped students\\" . The Standard After the crackdown on the movement, he left China and went to study at Columbia University. In 1990, he published a book about his experience in China titled Moving the Mountain: My Life in China. The book was the basis of a 1994 feature-film documentary, Moving the Mountain, produced by Trudie Styler and directed by Michael Apted, which probed the origins of the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square and the consequences of the movement in the lives of several of the movement's student leaders. Education Li graduated from Columbia University and he was one of the first in Columbia's history to receive three degrees simultaneously: a B.A. in Economics, a M.B.A. and a J.D. in 1996.  Marriage at Tiananmen Square  A marriage ceremony was held between Li Lu and his girlfriend, Zhao Ming, at the Heroes' Monument on May 22.Li Lu, Moving the Mountain, 174.

Many who attended the wedding found the joyous moment to be a symbol of hope and happiness.Li Lu, Moving the Mountain, 174. Their marriage was seen as a light backdrop to the movement; Li referred to it as \\"marriage on the execution ground.\\"Li Lu, Moving the Mountain, 174. Toward the end of his memoir, Moving the Mountain, Li does not mention his married life after the crackdown on June 4. There have since been no reports on Zhao Ming. Chai Ling quotes Li Lu in her book as saying the marriage was meaningless when he desired another woman after escaping.Ling Chai, A Heart for Freedom. Carol Stream, Illinois: Tyndale House, 2011, . Investment career Li was inspired to get into investment after hearing Warren Buffett, a Columbia alumnus, give a lecture at Columbia in 1993. After graduation, he founded Himalaya Capital Management, known for its disciplined and value-oriented approach to investing. From 1998 to 2004, he managed both a hedge fund and a venture capital fund. His fund suffered a 19% percent loss in 1998 from the Asian Financial Crisis. In late 2004, he transformed the hedge fund into a long-only investment vehicle, LL Investment Partners, LP, which is currently focused on global investment opportunities. Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and a long-time partner of the legendary investor Warren Buffett, is one of the investors of his fund, and a \\"mentor and good friend\\" (in Li Lu's own words).Li Lu‚Äôs Foreword for the Chinese version of Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack Li Lu has been known as the man who introduced the Chinese battery and auto maker BYD Company to Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. He is an informal advisor to BYD. His LL Investment Partners owns about 2.5% of BYD. Since 1998 the firm has had a \\"phenomenal\\" record, with compound returns of around 30% per year during a period of general stagnation in the market. Li Lu's investing mantra is \\"accurate and complete information,\\" including understanding the character of a CEO by visiting his local church and speaking to his neighbors. The firm at one point managed the money of Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner. Himalaya now has almost US$10 billion in capital under management. Li was rumored to be the front runner to manage a large portion of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio once Warren Buffett steps down. According to The Wall Street Journal, Charlie Munger once said \\"it is a foregone decision\\" that Li Lu would be going to be a member of Berkshire's top investors team after Warren Buffett retires.

Opening on a limited basis to the public in 1985 the purpose of the museum and foundation was and remains to preserve and display Noguchi's sculptures, architectural models, stage designs, drawings, and furniture designs. The two-story, museum and adjacent sculpture garden, located in Long Island City section of Queens, one block from the Socrates Sculpture Park, underwent major renovations in 2004 allowing the museum to stay open year-round. Description and history To house the museum, in 1974 Noguchi purchased a photogravure plant and gas station located across the street from his New York studio, where he had worked and lived since 1961. The Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum opened to the public in 1985 on a seasonal basis. In 1999, the Foundation Board approved a $13.5 million capital master plan to address structural concerns, ADA and NYC Building Code compliance and create a new public education facility. During renovation, the Museum relocated to a temporary space in Sunnyside, Queens, and held several thematic exhibitions of Noguchi's work. In February 2004, the museum was formally chartered as a museum, and granted 501(c)(3) public charity status. The Noguchi Museum reopened to the public at its newly renovated space in June 2004. The museum building continued to suffer from structural issues into the early 2000s and a second $8 million stabilization project was begun in September 2008. There are 12 galleries and a gift shop within the museum. =Tree of Heaven= Until March 26, 2008, a -tall 75-year-old Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) was a prominent centerpiece of the sculpture garden at the museum. The tree was spared by Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum and cleaned up its back lot. \\"[I]n a sense, the sculpture garden was designed around the tree\\", said a former aide to Noguchi, Bonnie Rychlak, who later became the museum curator. By early 2008, the tree was found to be dying and threatened to crash into the building, which was about to undergo an $8.2 million renovation.

He began his career as a bicycle racer and builder before moving on to motorcycles. As early as 1904, he began to manufacture engines for airships. In 1908, Curtiss joined the Aerial Experiment Association, a pioneering research group, founded by Alexander Graham Bell at Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia, to build flying machines. Curtiss made the first officially witnessed flight in North America, won a race at the world's first international air meet in France, and made the first long-distance flight in the United States. His contributions in designing and building aircraft led to the formation of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, now part of Curtiss-Wright Corporation. His company built aircraft for the U.S. Army and Navy, and, during the years leading up to World War I, his experiments with seaplanes led to advances in naval aviation. Curtiss civil and military aircraft were predominant in the interwar and World War II eras. Birth and early career Glenn Curtiss was born in Hammondsport in the Finger Lakes region of New York in 1878. His mother was Lua Curtiss n√©e Andrews and his father was Frank Richmond Curtiss a harness maker who had arrived in Hammondsport with Glenn's grandparents in 1876. Glenn's paternal grandparents were Claudius G. Curtiss, a Methodist Episcopal clergyman, and Ruth Bramble. Glenn Curtiss had a younger sister, Rutha Luella, also born in Hammondsport. Although his formal education extended only to eighth grade, his early interest in mechanics and inventions was evident at his first job at the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company (later Eastman Kodak Company) in Rochester, New York.Roseberry 1972, p. 10. He invented a stencil machine adopted at the plant and later built a rudimentary camera to study photography. Marriage and family On March 7, 1898, Curtiss married Lena Pearl Neff (1879‚Äì1951), daughter of Guy L. Neff and Jenny M. Potter, in Hammondsport, New York. They had two children: Carlton N. Curtiss (1901‚Äì1902) and Glenn Hammond Curtiss (1912‚Äì1969) Bicycles and motorcycles V-8 motorcycle in 1907 Curtiss began his career as a Western Union bicycle messenger, a bicycle racer, and bicycle-shop owner. In 1901, he developed an interest in motorcycles when internal-combustion engines became more available. In 1902, Curtiss began manufacturing motorcycles with his own single-cylinder engines. His first motorcycle's carburetor was adapted from a tomato soup can containing a gauze screen to pull the gasoline up by capillary action.Post, August. \\"The Evolution of a Flying-Man\\", The Century: A Popular Quarterly, Volume 81, 1911, pp. 13‚Äì14.

Curtiss primarily designed the AEA's third aircraft, Aerodrome #3, the famous June Bug, and became its test pilot, undertaking most of the proving flights. On July 4, 1908, he flew to win the Scientific American Trophy and its $2,500 prize.\\"Glenn H. Curtiss.\\" centennialofflight.net, 2003. Retrieved: July 20, 2009. This was considered to be the first pre-announced public flight of a heavier-than-air flying machine in America. The flight of the June Bug propelled Curtiss and aviation firmly into public awareness. On June 8, 1911 Curtiss received U.S. Pilot's License #1 from the Aero Club of America, because the first batch of licenses were issued in alphabetical order; Wilbur Wright received license #5. At the culmination of the Aerial Experiment Association's experiments, Curtiss offered to purchase the rights to Aerodrome #3, essentially using it as the basis of his \\"Curtiss No. 1, the first of his production series of pusher aircraft.Casey 1981, p. 38. = The pre-war years =  Aviation competitions  During the 1909‚Äì1910 period, Curtiss employed a number of demonstration pilots, including Eugene Ely, Charles K. Hamilton, Augustus Post, and Hugh Robinson. Aerial competitions and demonstration flights across North America helped to introduce aviation to a curious public; Curtiss took full advantage of these occasions to promote his products.Casey 1981, pp. 65‚Äì67. This was a busy period for Glenn Curtiss. Souvenir postcard of the Grande Semaine d'Aviation, 1909 In August 1909, Curtiss took part in the Grande Semaine d'Aviation aviation meeting at Reims, France, organized by the A√©ro-Club de France. The Wrights, who were selling their machines to customers in Germany at the time, decided not to compete in person. Two Wright aircraft (modified with a landing gear) were at the meet, but they did not win any events. Flying his No. 2 biplane, Curtiss won the overall speed event, the Gordon Bennett Cup, completing the 20-km (12.5-mile) course in just under 16 minutes at a speed of , six seconds faster than runner-up Louis Bl√©riot. On May 29, 1910, Curtiss flew from Albany to New York City to make the first long-distance flight between two major cities in the U.S. For this flight, which he completed in just under four hours including two stops to refuel, he won a $10,000 prize offered by publisher Joseph Pulitzer and was awarded permanent possession of the Scientific American trophy. In June 1910, Curtiss provided a simulated bombing demonstration to naval officers at Hammondsport. Two months later, Lt. Jacob E. Fickel demonstrated the feasibility of shooting at targets on the ground from an aircraft with Curtiss serving as pilot. One month later, in September, he trained Blanche Stuart Scott, who was possibly the first American woman pilot. The fictional character Tom Swift, who first appeared in 1910 in Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle and Tom Swift and His Airship, has been said to have been based on Glenn Curtiss.Dizer 1982, p. 35.

Retrieved: September 8, 2009. = Patent dispute = A patent lawsuit by the Wright brothers against Curtiss in 1909 continued until it was resolved during World War I. Since the last Wright aircraft, the Wright Model L, was a single prototype of a \\"scouting\\" aircraft, made in 1916, the U.S. government, desperately short of combat aircraft, pressured both firms to resolve the dispute. In 1917, the U.S. government offered a large and profitable contract to Curtiss to build aircraft for the U.S. Army. = Naval aviation = On November 14, 1910, Curtiss demonstration pilot Eugene Ely took off from a temporary platform mounted on the forward deck of the cruiser USS Birmingham. His successful takeoff and ensuing flight to shore marked the beginning of a relationship between Curtiss and the Navy that remained significant for decades. At the end of 1910, Curtiss established a winter encampment at San Diego to teach flying to Army and Naval personnel. Here, he trained Lt. Theodore Ellyson, who became U.S. Naval Aviator #1, and three Army officers, 1st Lt. Paul W. Beck, 2nd Lt. George E. M. Kelly, and 2nd Lt. John C. Walker, Jr., in the first military aviation school. (Chikuhei Nakajima, founder of Nakajima Aircraft Company, was a 1912 graduate.) The original site of this winter encampment is now part of Naval Air Station North Island and is referred to by the Navy as \\"The Birthplace of Naval Aviation\\". Through the course of that winter, Curtiss was able to develop a float (pontoon) design that enabled him to take off and land on water. On January 26, 1911, he flew the first seaplane from the water in the United States.Roseberry 1972, p. 314. Demonstrations of this advanced design were of great interest to the Navy, but more significant, as far as the Navy was concerned, was Eugene Ely successfully landing his Curtiss pusher (the same aircraft used to take off from the Birmingham) on a makeshift platform mounted on the rear deck of the battleship USS Pennsylvania. This was the first arrester-cable landing on a ship and the precursor of modern-day carrier operations. On January 28, 1911, Ellyson took off in a Curtiss ‚Äúgrass cutter‚Äù to become the first Naval aviator. \\"FIRM BELIEVERS IN TRANS-ATLANTIC AVIATION\\", Porte and Curtiss on the cover of Aero and Hydro, 14 March 1914 Curtiss custom built floats and adapted them onto a Model D so it could take off and land on water to prove the concept. On February 24, 1911, Curtiss made his first amphibious demonstration at North Island by taking off and alighting on both land and water. Back in Hammondsport, six months later in July 1911, Curtiss sold the U.S. Navy their first aircraft, the A-1 Triad. The A-1, which was primarily a seaplane, was equipped with retractable wheels, also making it the first amphibious aircraft. Curtiss trained the Navy's first pilots and built their first aircraft. For this, he is considered in the US to be \\"The Father of Naval Aviation\\". The Triad was immediately recognized as so obviously useful, it was purchased by the U.S. Navy, Russia, Japan, Germany, and Britain. Curtiss won the Collier Trophy for designing this aircraft.\\"The Curtiss Company.\\" US Centennial of Flight Commemoration, 2003. Retrieved: January 28, 2011. Around this time, Curtiss met retired British naval officer John Cyril Porte, who was looking for a partner to produce an aircraft with him to win the Daily Mail prize for the first transatlantic crossing. In 1912, Curtiss produced the two- seat Flying Fish, a larger craft that became classified as a flying boat because the hull sat in the water; it featured an innovative notch (known as a \\"step\\") in the hull that Porte recommended for breaking clear of the water at takeoff. Curtiss correctly surmised that this configuration was more suited to building a larger long-distance craft that could operate from water, and was also more stable when operating from a choppy surface. With the backing of Rodman Wanamaker, Porte and Curtiss produced the America in 1914, a larger flying boat with two engines, for the transatlantic crossing.  World War I and later  = World War I = With the start of World War I, Porte returned to service in the Royal Navy, which subsequently purchased several models of the America, now called the H-4, from Curtiss. Porte licensed and further developed the designs, constructing a range of Felixstowe long-range patrol aircraft, and from his experience passed along improvements to the hull to Curtiss. The later British designs were sold to the U.S. forces, or built by Curtiss as the F5L. The Curtiss factory also built a total of 68 \\"Large Americas\\", which evolved into the H-12, the only American designed and built aircraft to see combat in World War I. A Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) on a training flight during World War I As 1916 approached, the United States was feared to be drawn into the conflict. The Army's Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps ordered the development of a simple, easy-to-fly-and-maintain, two-seat trainer. Curtiss created the JN-4 \\"Jenny\\" for the Army, and the N-9 seaplane version for the Navy. They were some of the most famous products of the Curtiss company, and thousands were sold to the militaries of the United States, Canada, and Britain. Civilian and military aircraft demand boomed, and the company grew to employ 18,000 workers in Buffalo and 3,000 workers in Hammondsport. In 1917, the U.S. Navy commissioned Curtiss to design a long- range, four-engined flying boat large enough to hold a crew of five, which became known as the Curtiss NC. Three of the four NC flying boats built attempted a transatlantic crossing in 1919. Thus NC-4 became the first aircraft to be flown across the Atlantic Ocean, (a feat quickly overshadowed by the first non-stop atlantic crossing by Alcock and Brown,) while NC-1 and NC-3 were unable to continue past the Azores. NC-4 is now on permanent display in the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida. = Post-World War I = Peace brought cancellation of wartime contracts. In September 1920, the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company underwent a financial reorganization. Glenn Curtiss cashed out his stock in the company for $32 million and retired to Florida.Rosenberry 1972, p. 429. He continued on as a director of the company, but served only as an adviser on design. Clement M. Keys gained control of the company, which later became the nucleus of a large group of aviation companies.Studer 1937, p. 352. = Later years = Time cover, 13 Oct 1924 Curtiss and his family moved to Florida in the 1920s, where he founded 18 corporations, served on civic commissions, and donated extensive land and water rights.

His frequent hunting trips into the Florida Everglades led to a final invention, the Adams Motor \\"Bungalo\\", a forerunner of the modern recreational vehicle trailer (named after his business partner and half-brother, G. Carl Adams). Curtiss later developed this into a larger, more elaborate fifth-wheel vehicle, which he manufactured and sold under the name Aerocar. Shortly before his death, he designed a tailless aircraft with a V-shaped wing and tricycle landing gear that he hoped could be sold in the price range of a family car.\\"V-Shaped Plane Has Low Landing Speed.\\" Popular Science, March 1931. The Wright Aeronautical Corporation, a successor to the original Wright Company, ultimately merged with the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company on July 5, 1929, forming the Curtiss-Wright company, shortly before Curtiss's death. Death Traveling to Rochester to contest a lawsuit brought by former business partner August Herring, Curtiss suffered an attack of appendicitis in court. He died on July 23, 1930, in Buffalo, New York, of complications from an appendectomy. His funeral service was held at St. James Episcopal Church in his home town, Hammondsport, with interment in the family plot at Pleasant Valley Cemetery in Hammondsport.

It is located one block from the Noguchi Museum at the intersection of Broadway and Vernon Boulevard in the neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, New York City. In addition to exhibition space, the park offers an arts education program, artist residency program, and job training. History and description Socrates Sculpture Park is located atop the mouth of the buried Sunswick Creek. In 1986, American sculptor Mark di Suvero created Socrates Sculpture Park on an abandoned landfill and illegal dumpsite in Long Island City. The four acre site is the largest outdoor space in New York City dedicated to exhibiting sculpture. The former landfill was renovated into the current park by a team of contemporary artists and local youths. The park operated for 14 years with only a temporary city park status. In 1998, the park was given official status by then New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani as a permanent city park after a developer attempted to erect luxury apartments and a marina on the site after the park's lease had expired. In 2005, the park was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a US$20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.Carnegie Corporation of New York (2005-07-05).

The original Billboard was a mirror image of the street created by artist Mathieu Borysevicz built by ongoing volunteer Ross H.Radtke a mechanical engineer and neighbour. New Billboards are installed once or twice per year. Artists work with printmaking and photography to create an image that greets visitors as they enter the park, and sets the tone for the current show. The billboards are in conjunction with each spring exhibition.\\" The park has numerous workshops and public programming. Many artists lead tour programs of current exhibitions, there are summer art projects, and various free public events, such as yoga and capoeira on Saturdays and outdoor movie screenings on Wednesdays that begin in mid July and end in mid August. GrowNYC runs an Astoria Farmer's Market in the park every Saturday during the summer months.

The dolphin flipper at bottom left obeys the same principles in a different fluid medium; it is an example of a hydrofoil. An airfoil (American English) or aerofoil (British English) is the cross-sectional shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section). An airfoil- shaped body moving through a fluid produces an aerodynamic force. The component of this force perpendicular to the direction of motion is called lift. The component parallel to the direction of motion is called drag. Subsonic flight airfoils have a characteristic shape with a rounded leading edge, followed by a sharp trailing edge, often with a symmetric curvature of upper and lower surfaces. Foils of similar function designed with water as the working fluid are called hydrofoils. The lift on an airfoil is primarily the result of its angle of attack. When oriented at a suitable angle, the airfoil deflects the oncoming air (for fixed-wing aircraft, a downward force), resulting in a force on the airfoil in the direction opposite to the deflection. This force is known as aerodynamic force and can be resolved into two components: lift and drag. Most foil shapes require a positive angle of attack to generate lift, but cambered airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack. This \\"turning\\" of the air in the vicinity of the airfoil creates curved streamlines, resulting in lower pressure on one side and higher pressure on the other. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via Bernoulli's principle, so the resulting flowfield about the airfoil has a higher average velocity on the upper surface than on the lower surface. In some situations (e.g. inviscid potential flow) the lift force can be related directly to the average top/bottom velocity difference without computing the pressure by using the concept of circulation and the Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem.\\"...the effect of the wing is to give the air stream a downward velocity component. The reaction force of the deflected air mass must then act on the wing to give it an equal and opposite upward component.\\" In: \\"If the body is shaped, moved, or inclined in such a way as to produce a net deflection or turning of the flow, the local velocity is changed in magnitude, direction, or both. Changing the velocity creates a net force on the body\\" \\"The cause of the aerodynamic lifting force is the downward acceleration of air by the airfoil...\\" \\"...if a streamline is curved, there must be a pressure gradient across the streamline...\\" Overview Streamlines around a NACA 0012 airfoil at moderate angle of attack Lift and drag curves for a typical airfoil A fixed-wing aircraft's wings, horizontal, and vertical stabilizers are built with airfoil-shaped cross sections, as are helicopter rotor blades. Airfoils are also found in propellers, fans, compressors and turbines. Sails are also airfoils, and the underwater surfaces of sailboats, such as the centerboard and keel, are similar in cross-section and operate on the same principles as airfoils. Swimming and flying creatures and even many plants and sessile organisms employ airfoils/hydrofoils: common examples being bird wings, the bodies of fish, and the shape of sand dollars. An airfoil-shaped wing can create downforce on an automobile or other motor vehicle, improving traction. When the wind is obstructed by an object such as a flat plate, a building, or the deck of a bridge, the object will experience drag and also an aerodynamic force perpendicular to the wind. This does not mean the object qualifies as an airfoil. Airfoils are highly-efficient lifting shapes, able to generate more lift than similarly sized flat plates of the same area, and able to generate lift with significantly less drag. Airfoils have potential for use in the design of aircraft, propellers, rotor blades, wind turbines and other applications of aeronautical engineering. A lift and drag curve obtained in wind tunnel testing is shown on the right. The curve represents an airfoil with a positive camber so some lift is produced at zero angle of attack. With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called the slope of the lift curve. At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The drop in lift can be explained by the action of the upper-surface boundary layer, which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle. The thickened boundary layer's displacement thickness changes the airfoil's effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective camber, which modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the circulation and the lift. The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in pressure drag, so that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the stall point. Airfoil design is a major facet of aerodynamics. Various airfoils serve different flight regimes. Asymmetric airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack, while a symmetric airfoil may better suit frequent inverted flight as in an aerobatic airplane. In the region of the ailerons and near a wingtip a symmetric airfoil can be used to increase the range of angles of attack to avoid spin‚Äìstall. Thus a large range of angles can be used without boundary layer separation. Subsonic airfoils have a round leading edge, which is naturally insensitive to the angle of attack. The cross section is not strictly circular, however: the radius of curvature is increased before the wing achieves maximum thickness to minimize the chance of boundary layer separation. This elongates the wing and moves the point of maximum thickness back from the leading edge. Supersonic airfoils are much more angular in shape and can have a very sharp leading edge, which is very sensitive to angle of attack. A supercritical airfoil has its maximum thickness close to the leading edge to have a lot of length to slowly shock the supersonic flow back to subsonic speeds. Generally such transonic airfoils and also the supersonic airfoils have a low camber to reduce drag divergence. Modern aircraft wings may have different airfoil sections along the wing span, each one optimized for the conditions in each section of the wing. Movable high-lift devices, flaps and sometimes slats, are fitted to airfoils on almost every aircraft. A trailing edge flap acts similarly to an aileron; however, it, as opposed to an aileron, can be retracted partially into the wing if not used. A laminar flow wing has a maximum thickness in the middle camber line. Analyzing the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations in the linear regime shows that a negative pressure gradient along the flow has the same effect as reducing the speed. So with the maximum camber in the middle, maintaining a laminar flow over a larger percentage of the wing at a higher cruising speed is possible. However, some surface contamination will disrupt the laminar flow, making it turbulent. For example, with rain on the wing, the flow will be turbulent. Under certain conditions, insect debris on the wing will cause the loss of small regions of laminar flow as well. Before NASA's research in the 1970s and 1980s the aircraft design community understood from application attempts in the WW II era that laminar flow wing designs were not practical using common manufacturing tolerances and surface imperfections. That belief changed after new manufacturing methods were developed with composite materials (e.g. laminar-flow airfoils developed by F.X. Wortmann for use with wings made of fibre-reinforced plastic). Machined metal methods were also introduced. NASA's research in the 1980s revealed the practicality and usefulness of laminar flow wing designs and opened the way for laminar-flow applications on modern practical aircraft surfaces, from subsonic general aviation aircraft to transonic large transport aircraft, to supersonic designs. Schemes have been devised to define airfoils ‚Äì an example is the NACA system. Various airfoil generation systems are also used. An example of a general purpose airfoil that finds wide application, and pre‚Äìdates the NACA system, is the Clark-Y. Today, airfoils can be designed for specific functions by the use of computer programs.  Airfoil terminology  Airfoil nomenclature The various terms related to airfoils are defined below: *The suction surface (a.k.a. upper surface) is generally associated with higher velocity and lower static pressure. *The pressure surface (a.k.a. lower surface) has a comparatively higher static pressure than the suction surface. The pressure gradient between these two surfaces contributes to the lift force generated for a given airfoil. The geometry of the airfoil is described with a variety of terms : *The leading edge is the point at the front of the airfoil that has maximum curvature (minimum radius). *The trailing edge is defined similarly as the point of maximum curvature at the rear of the airfoil. *The chord line is the straight line connecting leading and trailing edges. The chord length, or simply chord, c, is the length of the chord line. That is the reference dimension of the airfoil section. Different definitions of airfoil thickness winglets (PSU 90-125WL) The shape of the airfoil is defined using the following geometrical parameters: *The mean camber line or mean line is the locus of points midway between the upper and lower surfaces. Its shape depends on the thickness distribution along the chord; *The thickness of an airfoil varies along the chord. It may be measured in either of two ways: ** Thickness measured perpendicular to the camber line. This is sometimes described as the \\"American convention\\"; ** Thickness measured perpendicular to the chord line. This is sometimes described as the \\"British convention\\". Some important parameters to describe an airfoil's shape are its camber and its thickness. For example, an airfoil of the NACA 4-digit series such as the NACA 2415 (to be read as 2 ‚Äì 4 ‚Äì 15) describes an airfoil with a camber of 0.02 chord located at 0.40 chord, with 0.15 chord of maximum thickness. Finally, important concepts used to describe the airfoil's behaviour when moving through a fluid are: *The aerodynamic center, which is the chord-wise length about which the pitching moment is independent of the lift coefficient and the angle of attack. *The center of pressure, which is the chord-wise location about which the pitching moment is zero. Thin airfoil theory An airfoil section is displayed at the tip of this Denney Kitfox aircraft, built in 1991. Airfoil of a Kamov Ka-26 helicopter's lower rotor blade Thin airfoil theory is a simple theory of airfoils that relates angle of attack to lift for incompressible, inviscid flows. It was devised by German-American mathematician Max Munk and further refined by British aerodynamicist Hermann Glauert and othersAbbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E. (1959), Theory of Wing Sections, Section 4.2, Dover Publications Inc., New York, Standard Book Number 486-60586-8 in the 1920s. The theory idealizes the flow around an airfoil as two-dimensional flow around a thin airfoil. It can be imagined as addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite wingspan. Thin airfoil theory was particularly notable in its day because it provided a sound theoretical basis for the following important properties of airfoils in two- dimensional flow:Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E. (1959), Theory of Wing Sections, Section 4.3Clancy, L.J. (1975), Aerodynamics, Sections 8.1 to 8.8, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. # on a symmetric airfoil, the center of pressure and aerodynamic center are coincident and lie exactly one quarter of the chord behind the leading edge. # on a cambered airfoil, the aerodynamic center lies exactly one quarter of the chord behind the leading edge. # the slope of the lift coefficient versus angle of attack line is 2 \\\\pi\\\\\\\\! units per radian. As a consequence of (3), the section lift coefficient of a symmetric airfoil of infinite wingspan is: : \\\\ c_l = 2\\\\pi \\\\alpha :where c_l\\\\\\\\! is the section lift coefficient, :\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\! is the angle of attack in radians, measured relative to the chord line. (The above expression is also applicable to a cambered airfoil where \\\\alpha\\\\\\\\! is the angle of attack measured relative to the zero-lift line instead of the chord line.) Also as a consequence of (3), the section lift coefficient of a cambered airfoil of infinite wingspan is: : \\\\ c_l = c_{l_0} + 2\\\\pi\\\\alpha :where \\\\ c_{l_0} is the section lift coefficient when the angle of attack is zero. Thin airfoil theory does not account for the stall of the airfoil, which usually occurs at an angle of attack between 10¬∞ and 15¬∞ for typical airfoils.Aerospaceweb's information on Thin Airfoil Theory In the mid-late 2000s, however, a theory predicting the onset of leading-edge stall was proposed by Wallace J. Morris II in his doctoral thesis. Morris's subsequent refinements contain the details on the current state of theoretical knowledge on the leading-edge stall phenomenon. Morris's theory predicts the critical angle of attack for leading-edge stall onset as the condition at which a global separation zone is predicted in the solution for the inner flow. Morris's theory demonstrates that a subsonic flow about a thin airfoil can be described in terms of an outer region, around most of the airfoil chord, and an inner region, around the nose, that asymptotically match each other. As the flow in the outer region is dominated by classical thin airfoil theory, Morris's equations exhibit many components of thin airfoil theory.

The mean- line, y(x), is considered to produce a distribution of vorticity \\\\gamma (s) along the line, s. By the Kutta condition, the vorticity is zero at the trailing edge. Since the airfoil is thin, x (chord position) can be used instead of s, and all angles can be approximated as small. From the Biot‚ÄìSavart law, this vorticity produces a flow field w(x) where :w(x) = \\\\frac{1} {(2 \\\\pi)} \\\\int_{0}^{c} \\\\frac {\\\\gamma (x')}{(x-x')} dx' x is the location where induced velocity is produced, x' is the location of the vortex element producing the velocity and c is the chord length of the airfoil. Since there is no flow normal to the curved surface of the airfoil, w(x) balances that from the component of main flow V, which is locally normal to the plate ‚Äì the main flow is locally inclined to the plate by an angle \\\\alpha - dy/dx. That is: :V \\\\; (\\\\alpha - dy/dx) = w(x) = \\\\frac{1} {(2 \\\\pi)} \\\\int_{0}^{c} \\\\frac {\\\\gamma (x')}{(x-x')} dx' This integral equation can be solved for \\\\gamma(x), after replacing x by :\\\\ x =c \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1 - \\\\cos (\\\\theta )}{2} , as a Fourier series in A_n \\\\sin(n \\\\theta) with a modified lead term A_0 (1 + \\\\cos (\\\\theta)) / \\\\sin(\\\\theta) That is :\\\\frac{\\\\gamma(\\\\theta)} {(2V)} = A_0 \\\\frac {(1 + \\\\cos(\\\\theta))} {\\\\sin(\\\\theta)} + \\\\sum A_n \\\\; \\\\sin (n \\\\theta)) (These terms are known as the Glauert integral).

From this it follows that the center of pressure is aft of the 'quarter-chord' point 0.25 c, by : \\\\ \\\\Delta x /c = \\\\pi /4 ((A_1-A_2)/C_L) The aerodynamic center, AC, is at the quarter-chord point.

While Britain stood largely aloof from the Alliance's illiberal actions, the four continental monarchies were successful in authorising Austrian military action in Italy in 1821 and French intervention in Spain in 1823. The Alliance is conventionally taken to have become defunct along with the Holy Alliance of the three original continental members following the death of Emperor Alexander I of Russia in 1825.

It was created after the final defeat of Napoleon at the behest of Emperor (Tsar) Alexander I of Russia and signed in Paris on 26 September 1815.Holy Alliance, Catholic Encyclopedia The alliance aimed to restrain liberalism and secularism in Europe in the wake of the devastating French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and it nominally succeeded in this until the Crimean War. Otto von Bismarck managed to reunite the Holy Alliance following the unification of Germany in 1871, but the alliance again faltered by the 1880s over Austrian and Russian conflicts of interest over the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.E.J. Knapton, \\"The Origins of the Treaty of Holy Alliance.\\" History 26.102 (1941): 132-140. online Establishment Ostensibly, the alliance was formed to instill the divine right of kings and Christian values in European political life, as pursued by Alexander I under the influence of his spiritual adviser Baroness Barbara von Kr√ºdener. Under the treaty European rulers would agree to govern as \\"branches\\" of the Christian community and offer mutual service. The agreement was at first secret, and mistrusted by liberals though liberalism was effectively restrained in this political culture until the Revolutions of 1848.Eastern Europe: An Historical Geography, 1815-1945 p23 About three months after the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, the monarchs of Catholic (Austria), Protestant (Prussia), and Orthodox (Russia) confession promised to act on the basis of \\"justice, love and peace\\", both in internal and foreign affairs, for \\"consolidating human institutions and remedying their imperfections\\". The Alliance was quickly rejected by the United Kingdom (though George IV declared consent in his capacity as King of Hanover), the Papal States, and the Ottoman Empire. Lord Castlereagh, the British Foreign Secretary, called it \\"a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense\\".Stephen A. Fischer-Galati, \\"The Nature and Immediate Origins of the Treaty of Holy Alliance\\". History 38.132 (1953): 27‚Äì39. Organization In practice, the Austrian state chancellor and foreign minister, Prince Klemens von Metternich made it a bastion against democracy, revolution, and secularism (although it is said that his first reaction was to call it \\"a resounding nothing\\"). The monarchs in the Alliance used it to suppress revolutionary influence (especially from the French Revolution) from entering their own nations. Contemporary caricature of the Congress of Verona, 1822 The Alliance is usually associated with the later Quadruple and Quintuple Alliances, which included the United Kingdom and (from 1818) France with the aim of upholding the European peace settlement and balance of power in the Concert of Europe concluded at the Congress of Vienna. On 29 September 1818, Alexander, Emperor Francis I of Austria and King Frederick William III of Prussia met with the Duke of Wellington, Viscount Castlereagh and the Duc de Richelieu at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle to demand stern measures against university \\"demagogues\\", which would be realized in the Carlsbad Decrees of the following year. At the Congress of Troppau in 1820 and the succeeding Congress of Laibach in 1821, Metternich tried to align his allies in the suppression of the Carbonari revolt against King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. In 1821 the Alliance met in Ljubljana. The Quintuple Alliance met for the last time at the Congress of Verona in 1822 to advise against the Greek Revolution and to resolve upon the French invasion of Spain. The last meetings had revealed the rising antagonism with Britain and France, especially on Italian unification, the right to self-determination, and the Eastern Question. The Alliance is conventionally taken to have become defunct with Alexander's death in 1825. France ultimately went her separate way following the July Revolution of 1830, leaving the core of Austria, Prussia, and Russia as a Central-Eastern European block which once again congregated to suppress the Revolutions of 1848. The Austro-Russian alliance finally broke up in the Crimean War. Though Russia had helped to suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Austria did not take any action to support her ally, declared herself neutral, and even occupied the Wallachian and Moldavian lands on the Danube upon the Russian retreat in 1854. Thereafter, Austria remained isolated, which added to the loss of her leading role in the German states, culminating in her defeat during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866.

It was released by Atari Corporation in 1987 and marketed as a home video game console alongside the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega's Master System, and Atari's own Atari 7800. The XEGS is compatible with existing Atari 8-bit family hardware and software. Without keyboard, the system operates as a stand-alone game console. With the keyboard, it boots identically to the Atari XE computers. Atari packaged the XEGS as a basic set consisting of only the console and joystick, and as a deluxe set consisting of the console, keyboard, CX40 joystick, and XG-1 light gun. The XEGS release was backed by new games, including Barnyard Blaster and Bug Hunt, plus cartridge ports of older games, such as Fight Night (Accolade, 1985), Lode Runner (Broderbund, 1983), Necromancer (Synapse Software, 1982), and Ballblazer (Lucasfilm Games, 1985). Support for the system was dropped in 1992 along with rest of Atari's 8-bit computers as well as the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800. History John J. Anderson of Creative Computing stated in 1984, when Atari, Inc. had great financial difficulties as a division of Warner Communications, that it should have released a video game console in 1981 based on its Atari 8-bit computers and compatible with its software library. The company instead released the Atari 5200 with almost exactly the same technology as the 8-bit computers, but incompatible with their software. After Jack Tramiel purchased the company, Atari Corporation re-released two game consoles in 1986: the Atari 7800, which had previously been released in a brief test run in 1984; and a lower cost redesign of the Atari 2600. The XEGS followed, building on Atari's 8-bit computer line which had started with the Atari 400 and 800. In practice the XEGS is a repackaged Atari 65XE, is compatible with the existing range of Atari 8-bit computer software and peripherals, and thus can function as a home computer. Atari conceived the console in a plan to increase the company's console market share while improving sales of its 8-bit home computer family. Providing a \\"beginning computer\\" and \\"sophisticated game console\\" in one device, was thought to convince more retailers and software developers to support the platform. In May 1987, Atari's then Director of Communications, Neil Harris, updated the online Atari community by outlining this plan. It noted that the XEGS was intended to further the 8-bit line by providing mass- merchants with a device that was more appealing to their markets. The system co-existed with the Atari 7800 and remodeled Atari 2600 on store shelves and was occasionally featured alongside those systems in Atari print ads and television commercials. Games This cartridge reissue of Blue Max illustrates the standard \\"Atari XE Video Game Cartridge\\" box design. It is coloured blue with a pattern of criss-crossing lines and features artwork from the original release superimposed on top. The XEGS shipped with the Atari 8-bit version of Missile Command built in, Flight Simulator II bundled with the keyboard component, and Bug Hunt which is compatible with the light gun. As the XEGS is compatible with the earlier 8-bit software, many games released under the XEGS banner were simply older games rebadged. This was done to the extent that some games were shipped in the old Atari 400/800 packaging, bearing only a new sticker to indicate that they were also compatible with the XEGS. Reception Atari sold 100,000 XE Game Systems during the Christmas season in 1987, every unit that was produced during its launch window. Peripherals The XEGS was released in a basic set and a deluxe set. The basic set includes only the console and a standard CX40 joystick (albeit with a grey base to match the XEGS, rather than the original black). The deluxe set consists of the console, the CX40 joystick, a keyboard which enables home computer functionality, and the XG-1 light gun. The keyboard and light gun were also released separately outside North America. This is the first light gun produced by Atari, and it is also compatible with the Atari 7800 and Atari 2600. The system can also use Atari 8-bit peripherals, such as disk drives, modems, and printers.

The only land of significant size is called Green Island and is a habitat for hundreds of thousands of seabirds. A short, unused and unmaintained runway and a portion of one building, both from a former United States Coast Guard LORAN station, are located on the island. Politically, it is part of Hawaii, although separated from the rest of the state by Midway, which is a separate unorganized territory. Green Island, in addition to being the nesting grounds of tens of thousands of seabirds, has recorded several vagrant terrestrial birds including snow bunting, eyebrowed thrush, brambling, olive-backed pipit, black kite, Steller's sea eagle and Chinese sparrowhawk. It is currently managed as a Wildlife Bird Sanctuary by the State of Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resource--Division of Forestry and Wildlife as one of the co-trustees of PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument with support from Kure Atoll Conservancy. Geography The International Date Line lies approximately 100 miles (87 nmi/160 km) to the west. Although located to the west of Midway Atoll, Kure Atoll has a time zone 1 hour ahead at UTC‚àí10:00 (the same as the rest of Hawaii). Kure is the northernmost coral atoll in the world.Samu, Tanya (2004). Geography: Year 12. Government of Samoa: Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture. Page 18. . It consists of a 6-mile (10 km) wide nearly circular barrier reef surrounding a shallow lagoon and several sand islets. There is a total land area of , with Green Island on the southeast side having of this total. A growing number of Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) haul out on its beaches. Climate Data chart below has been taken from Midway Atoll due to a lack of any weather stations present on Kure Atoll. Kure Atoll features a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen Aw) with high year-round temperatures. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, with only two months being able to be classified as dry season months (May and June). Geological history and future The geological history of Kure is generally similar to Midway, but Kure lies close to what is called the Darwin Point, the latitude north of which the rate of natural reef subsidence and destruction surpasses the rate of reef growth. At approximately 30 million years old, it is the oldest in the Hawaiian Island chain. As Kure continues to be slowly carried along to the northwest by the motion of the Pacific Plate, it will move into waters too cool for coral and coralline algae growth to keep up with isostatic subsidence of the mountain. Currently the atoll is warmed by the pools of water at the ends of the warm Kuroshio Current, keeping it in very comfortable range in winter. Barring unforeseen evolution, it will then begin to join the other volcanic and reef-topped remnants of the Hawaiian‚ÄìEmperor seamount chain to the northwest, all of which are now seamounts. Human exploration and use Green Island from the air In the Hawaiian language the term MokupƒÅpapa was used for any flat island with reefs. The northwestern islands are associated with KƒÅne Milohai in Hawaiian mythology. The brother of Pele (creator of the islands) was left to stand guard for travelers. Before the mid-19th century, Kure Atoll was visited by several ships and given new names each time. Sometimes spelled Cure, its English name was for a Russian navigator who sighted the atoll. It was officially named Kure Island in 1924 and then Kure Atoll in 1987. Many crews were stranded on Kure Atoll after being shipwrecked on the surrounding reefs and had to survive on the local seals, turtles, and birds. The shipwrecks remain on the reef today, including the . Because of these incidents, King KalƒÅkaua sent Colonel J. H. Boyd to Kure as his Special Commissioner. On September 20, 1886, he took possession of the island for the Hawaiian government. The King ordered that a crude house be built on the island, with tanks for holding water and provisions for any other unfortunates who might be cast away there. But the provisions were stolen within a year and the house soon fell into ruins. Largely neglected for most of its history, during World War II Kure was routinely visited by U.S. Navy patrols from nearby Midway to ensure that the Japanese were not using it to refuel submarines or flying boats from submarine-tankers for attacks elsewhere in the Hawaiian chain. During the Battle of Midway, a Japanese Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" bomber, operating from aircraft carrier Hiry≈´, piloted by Lieutenant Kikuchi Rokur≈ç, and which had been involved in the initial Japanese attack on Midway's US installations, crash-landed near Kure after being damaged by US fighters. Once ashore, Lt. Kikuchi and the two other members of his crew (Warrant Officer Yumoto Noriyoshi and Petty Officer (1st Class) Narasaki Hironori) refused capture and were either killed or committed suicide when an American landing party tried to capture them. The United States Coast Guard LORAN station at Kure in 1971 Volunteer tents and albatrosses at Kure Kure is located within a major current which washes up debris from the Great Pacific garbage patch, such as fishing nets and large numbers of cigarette lighters, on the island. These pose threats to the local animals, especially birds, whose skeletons are frequently found with plastic in the stomach cavity.PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument Kure Atoll On October 16, 1998, the longline fishing vessel Paradise Queen II ran aground on the eastern edge of Green Island of Kure Atoll, spilling approximately 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel before recovery operations could commence. Debris from that shipwreck continued to pollute the reef and shoreline for many years, endangering wildlife and damaging the coral reef. The long-term impact of this and other wrecks within the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) highlight the dangers to sensitive habitats in the area. To help ensure their protection, the PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument was designated a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) in 2008 by the International Maritime Organization. In addition to avoiding specific areas, owners must identify when their ship enters and leaves the PSSA's 10 nautical mile wide reporting area so a timely response can be taken should there be a maritime emergency. From 1960 to 1992, a United States Coast Guard LORAN station was located on Green Island. A short coral runway was built on the island to support Coast Guard operations, but it was abandoned and is currently unusable. Although there is no permanent human population, the atoll is formally part of the City and County of Honolulu. It became a state wildlife sanctuary in 1981. Since 1993 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources and volunteers from the Kure Atoll Conservancy group have helped to restore the atoll to a more natural state. Jean-Michel Cousteau produced a video on a voyage to Kure which first aired in 2006. Since 2010 the Division of Forestry and Wildlife has had a year-round presence on Kure Atoll. =Amateur radio= Because of its particularly remote location, Kure Island has been the scene of several amateur radio DX expeditions, or DX- peditions. Because the radio propagation path between Kure and Europe runs right over the North Polar region, opportunities for distant communication with Kure are particularly popular among European amateurs. Some of the DXpeditions to Kure were: * 1969Callsign: KH6NR/KH6From November 11 to November 14, 1969, Marine Staff Sergeant Don Chilcote, KH6GKV (now VE6NN), and Navy ICFN Gene Lewis, KH6HDB (now W5LE), operated from Kure Island, using the U.S. Navy Reserve Training Center, Honolulu's callsign. * 1970 Callsign: W7UXP/KH6 - October by WB2OIF, KH6HCM/W7UXP, KH6HGP/W7WOX * 1971‚Äì72Callsign: KH6EDY‚ÄîThe U.S. Coast Guard Loran Station Kure Island's callsign. * 1973‚Äì74Callsign: KH6HDBFrom September 1973 to September 1974, Gene Lewis, KH6HDB (now W5LE), operated from Kure Island. Lewis had been one of the two operators to activate Kure during the one-week DXpedition of KH6NR/KH6 during November 1969. He subsequently joined the Coast Guard for the express purpose of getting to spend a one-year tour of duty on Kure Island. * 1997Event call sign: K7K. This was a joint scientific/radio operation including four fish and wildlife scientists and the eight members of the Midway-Kure DX Foundation's 1996 Midway team. The team included four scientists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. * 2005Event call sign: K7C. The team consisted of 12 amateur radio operators from the United States, Canada, and Germany. *2018 - the Pacific Island DX-pedition Group's 4th application since 2014 was rejected by the Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, citing the inability to provide \\"adequate safeguards for the resources and ecological integrity\\" of Kure Atoll, despite successful Amateur Radio activations, with U. S. Fish and Wildlife representation, on Palmyra, Navassa, and Baker Island with no harmful impact to those island habitats.

While the entire 7 km beach around to Point Grey from Acadia Beach to Booming Ground Creek is often referred to as Wreck Beach, the large sandy area on the north side of the North Arm Breakwater at the base of Trail 6 is what many think of when they talk about Wreck Beach. The trail is the most developed of the trails down the bluff and has about 500 wooden steps set into the soil. At the bottom of Trail 6 is the most popular portion of the beach, a stretch of sand between two artificial rock jetties constructed as breakwaters, lined by a row of licensed vendors selling imported clothing, jewelry, drinks, snacks, and other beach related items. Other unlicensed vendors may be found wandering the beach selling alcoholic beverages and other more illicit cash crops of British Columbia. Clothing is optional throughout Wreck Beach. Due to Wreck Beach's proximity to the University of British Columbia, many students and some faculty and staff visit the beach. In recent years many beach users have objected, on both privacy and environmental grounds, to the University's plans to construct new buildings close to the cliff edge and partially overlooking the beach.  Swimming and ocean water quality  Swimming is popular at Wreck Beach, primarily as brief \\"dips\\" for beachgoers to cool off. Since the ocean water is quite cold, swimming far from shore without a wetsuit and partner is not advised. Ocean waves in the summer, when present, are quite small and usually do not pose a risk to swimmers or waders. Rip currents are not known to be a problem and advisories are not usually posted. Caution should be taken when diving or jumping into the water to avoid any submerged rocks. Adverse interactions with marine wildlife or flora are unlikely, but jellyfish should be avoided as a precautionary measure. Small pleasure boats may anchor close to the beach and swimmers should avoid potential collisions with them. A few times over the years, Metro Vancouver health authorities have issued advisories that the ocean's coliform bacteria counts near the beach are relatively high, and there may be potential risk to swimmers. However, Wreck Beach tends to have lower counts than many Vancouver beaches and gastrointestinal illness is generally unlikely.  Access  Trail 4 leading down to the Tower Beach area of Wreck Beach. Wreck Beach adjoins the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus, west of the city limits of Vancouver. It is accessible by road, water, and public buses. The most popular part of the beach, at the bottom of Trail 6, is about 12 km by road from downtown Vancouver and a short but steep walk from the University. TransLink runs a number of bus routes (C20, 4, 9, 14, 25, 33, 41, 43, 44, 49, 84, 99, 258, and 480) to the UBC bus loop. From there it is a five-minute walk west, down University Boulevard, to UBC Gate 6 (from which Trail 6 takes its name). Turn right on N.W. Marine Drive and the trail is immediately to the left about 100 meters. The C20 bus goes by Trail 6 entrance, and there is a stop at University Boulevard and North West Marine Drive. From Highway 99, turn west on one of these roads: S.W. Marine Drive, 41st Avenue (which eventually merges onto S.W. Marine Drive) or 16th Avenue (which eventually ends at S.W. Marine Drive, then turn right). Alternatively, from the north only, take the 4th Avenue exit off the Granville Street Bridge (then from 4th Avenue, turn right on N.W. Marine Drive). From Highway 1, take the Grandview Highway exit (28A) westbound (this eventually becomes 12th Avenue), turn right (north) on Clark Drive, left again (west) on 6th Avenue (this eventually becomes 4th Avenue), and then turn right on N.W. Marine Drive. Wreck Beach lies at the base of a cliff; therefore the trails are fairly steep. Trail 6 and Trail 7 both have stairs. Trail 6 includes about 500 wooden steps and is the better developed of the two trails. The path from the Acadia Beach parking lot is the most gentle slope and provides the easiest access to a clothing-optional area. When the tide is not too high, it is possible to walk along the entire shore: from Acadia Beach past the base of Trail 7. Erosion can make the route south of Trail 6 a bit tricky, and it can often be quite muddy.  Parking  A ground-level view from Wreck Beach, looking towards Bowen Island. There is a small parking lot at Acadia Beach, a pay parking lot south of Trail 6 and several pay parking lots on the UBC campus. Free parking is also allowed all along the east side of S.W. Marine Drive (opposite the cliff side) and along Old Marine Drive. Illegally parked vehicles are often towed away.  Toilets  The GVRD provides limited sanitary facilities. There are outhouses by the Acadia Beach parking lot and at the tops of Trails 6 and 7 and at the base of Trail 6. There is no running water, so many visitors bring their own.

He has also worked in the studios with many well-known artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, earning him a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement. Biography Booker T. Jones was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on November 12, 1944. He was named after his father, Booker T. Jones, Sr., who was named in honor of Booker T. Washington, the educator. Booker T. Jones, Sr. was a science teacher at Memphis High School, providing the family with a relatively stable, lower middle-class lifestyle. Booker T. Jones's childhood home on Edith Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee Jones was musically a child prodigy, playing the oboe, saxophone, trombone, double bass, and piano at school and organ at church. Jones attended Booker T. Washington High School, the alma mater of Rufus Thomas, and contributed with future stars like Isaac Hayes's writing partner David Porter, saxophonist Andrew Love of the Memphis Horns, soul singer/songwriter William Bell, and Earth, Wind & Fire's singer/songwriter Maurice White. Jones's entry into professional music came at the age of 16, when he played baritone saxophone on Satellite (soon to be Stax) Records' first hit, \\"Cause I Love You\\", by Carla and Rufus Thomas. Willie Mitchell hired Jones for his band, in which Jones started on sax and later moved to bass. It was here that he met Al Jackson Jr., who he brought to Stax. Simultaneously, Jones formed a combo with Maurice White and David Porter, in which he played guitar. While hanging around the Satellite Record Shop run by Estelle Axton, co-owner of Satellite Records with her brother Jim Stewart, Jones met record clerk Steve Cropper, who would become one of the MGs when the group formed in 1962. Besides Jones on organ and Cropper on guitar, Booker T. and the MGs featured Lewie Steinberg on bass guitar and Al Jackson, Jr. on drums (Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn eventually replacing Steinberg on bass). While still in high school, Jones co-wrote the group's classic instrumental \\"Green Onions\\", which was a massive hit in 1962. Bob Altshuler wrote the sleeve notes on the first Booker T. & the M.G.'s album Green Onions released by Stax Records in 1962: :[His] musical talents became apparent at a very early age. By the time he entered high school, Booker was already a semi-professional, and quickly recognized as the most talented musician in his school. He was appointed director of the school band for four years, and in addition, organized the school dance orchestra which played for proms throughout the Mid-South. In the classroom, he concentrated on the studies of music theory and harmony. ... Booker's multiple activities earned him a coveted honour, that of being listed in the students' \\"Who's Who of American High Schools.\\" Booker's first instrument was the string bass, but he soon switched to the organ. Booker came to the attention of record executive Jim Stewart in Memphis, and while still in high school he worked as a staff musician for Stax Records, appearing as sideman on many recording dates for that label. It became obvious that one day Booker would be ready to record under his own name and several months later Booker's first recording session was set. Over the next few years, Jones divided his time between studying classical music composition, composing and transposition at Indiana University, playing with the MGs on the weekends back in Memphis,Ware, Vron and Les Back. Out of Whiteness: Color, Politics, and Culture, The University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 245. Excerpt at books.google.com. serving as a session musician with other Stax acts, and writing songs that became widely regarded as classics. He wrote, with Eddie Floyd, \\"I've Never Found a Girl (To Love Me Like You Do)\\", Otis Redding's \\"I Love You More Than Words Can Say\\", and, with William Bell, bluesman Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" (later popularized by the cover version recorded by the British power trio Cream). In 1970, Jones moved to California and stopped playing sessions for Stax after becoming frustrated with Stax's treatment of the MGs as employees rather than musicians. Even though Jones was given the title of Vice President at Stax before leaving, as he put it, \\"There were titles given (to us) but we didn't actually make the decisions.\\" While still under contract to Stax, he appeared on Stephen Stills's eponymous album (1970). The 1971 album Melting Pot would be the last Booker T. & the M.G.'s album issued on Stax. Jones was married to Priscilla Coolidge in 1969, sister of singer Rita Coolidge. He produced Priscilla's first album Gypsy Queen in 1970; then the pair collaborated as a duo on three albums: 1971's Booker T. & Priscilla, 1972's Home Grown, and 1973's Chronicles, and Jones produced Priscilla's final solo album, Flying, in 1979, right as their marriage ended that year.Megan Diskin, \\"Murder-suicide victim was sister of Rita Coolidge\\", Ventura County Star, October 5, 2014. Making the charts as a solo artist in 1981 with \\"I Want You\\", he produced Bill Withers's 1971 debut album Just as I Am (on which Jones played guitar as well as keyboards), Rita Coolidge's album Love Me Again (1978) and Willie Nelson's album Stardust (1978). Jones has also added his keyboard playing to artists ranging from the R&B;/pop/blues of Ray Charles to the folk rock/country rock of Neil Young. On June 18, 1985, Jones married Nanine Warhurst. They have three children together, and an additional five stepchildren from their prior relationships. On March 1, 1995, Booker T. & the MGs won their first Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for the song \\"Cruisin'\\". Jones still plays with the MGs and his own small combo called the Booker T. Jones Band. His current touring group includes Vernon \\"Ice\\" Black (guitar), Darian Gray (drums), and Melvin Brannon (bass). Jones was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and was honored with a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement on February 11, 2007.\\"The Doors celebrate Grammy honour\\", BBC News, February 11, 2007.

He is featured on the Rancid album Let the Dominoes Fall (2009), playing a Hammond B-3 on the track \\"Up to No Good\\". Jones also played his B-3 on the track \\"If It Wasn't For Bad\\" from the Elton John and Leon Russell 2010 collaboration album titled The Union. The track was nominated at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. In 2011, Jones released The Road from Memphis. The backing band included Questlove (drums), \\"Captain\\" Kirk Douglas (guitar) and Owen Biddle (bass) from the Roots as well as former Motown guitarist Dennis Coffey and percussionist Stewart Killen. The album features vocals by Yim Yames, Matt Berninger, Lou Reed, Sharon Jones and Booker T. himself, as well as lyrics contributed by his daughter/manager Liv Jones. Jones also recorded with party band the Gypsy Queens on their eponymous album.Ventura Highway ‚Äî The Gypsy Queens Feat. Dewey Bunnell, Booker T. Jones & Gerry Beckley, DR.dk. On February 12, 2012, The Road from Memphis won at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Jones holds a total of four Grammy Awards. Jones received an honorary doctorate degree from Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music at its 2012 undergraduate commencement. Jones originally attended Indiana University in the 1960s, even staying after his smash-hit Stax Records recordings. Jones was featured on organ for singer Kelly Hogan on Hogan's 2013 release on Anti-Records, I Like to Keep Myself in Pain. In June 2013, Jones released his 10th album, Sound The Alarm, on Stax Records after originally leaving the label more than 40 years previously in 1971.

It is conventionally romanized by scholars as Hann to distinguish it from the later Han dynasty (). It was located in central China (modern-day Shanxi and Henan) in a region south and east of Luoyang, the capital of the Eastern Zhou. It was ruled by a royal family who were former ministers in the state of Jin that had slowly gained power from the Jin royal family until they were able to divide Jin into the three new states of Han, Wei and Zhao with the assistance of two other ministerial families. The state of Han was small and located in a mountainous and unprofitable region. Its territory directly blocked the passage of the state of Qin into the North China Plain.. Although Han had attempted to reform its governance (notably under Chancellor and \\"Legalist\\" Shen Buhai who improved state administration and strengthened its military ability) these reforms were not enough to defend itself and it was the first of the seven warring states to be conquered by Qin in 230 BC. Qin invasion of Han's Shangdang Commandery in 260 BC was allegedly bloodiest battle of the Warring States period, allegedly 400,000 soldiers and war animals died while others believe it to be an exaggeration (at Changping). History =Founding= According to chapter 45 of the Records of the Grand Historian, the royal family of Han was a cadet branch of the royal family of the state of Jin. The founder of the Han clan Wuzi of Han was the uncle of Duke Wu of Jin. Members of the family became ministers in the powerful state of Jin and were granted Hanyuan (modern Hancheng in Shaanxi). =Spring and Autumn period= During the Spring and Autumn period, members of the Han family slowly gained more and more influence and power within Jin. In 403 , Jing of Han, along with Wen of Wei and Lie of Zhao partitioned Jin among themselves. In Chinese history, this Partition of Jin is the event which marks the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States. Subsequently, Han was an independent polity. King Lie eventually recognized the new states in 403 BC and elevated the rulers to (hou, \\"marquess\\"). =Warring States Period= Han's highest point occurred under the rule of Marquess Xi. Xi appointed Shen Buhai as his chancellor and implemented his Legalist policies. These reforms improved state administration and strengthened its military capability. Under King Xuanhui (332-312 ), Han declared itself an independent kingdom. However, Han was disadvantaged in the competition of the Warring States because Jin's partition had left it surrounded on all sides by other strong states Chu to the south, Qi to the east, Qin to the west, and Wei to the north. It was the smallest of the seven states and, without any easy way to expand its own territory and resources, it was bullied militarily by its more powerful neighbors. =Defeat= During its steady decline, Han eventually lost the power to defend its territory and had to request military assistance from other states. The contest between Wei and Qi over control of Han resulted in the Battle of Maling, which established Qi as the pre-eminent state in the east. In 260 , Qin's invasion of Han led to Zhao intervention and the Battle of Changping. During the late years of the era, in an attempt to drain Qin's resources in an expensive public works project, the state of Han sent the civil engineer Zheng Guo to Qin to persuade them to build a canal. The scheme, while expensive, backfired spectacularly when it was eventually completed: the irrigation abilities of the new Zhengguo Canal far outweighed its cost and gave Qin the agricultural and economic means to dominate the other six states. Han was the first to fall, in 230 . In 226 BC, former nobility of the Han launched a failed rebellion in former capital Xinzheng, and King An, the last king of Han, was put to death the same year. Han Xin was made a \\"Prince\\" or \\"King of Han\\" () by Liu Bang after the establishment of the Han dynasty (). He was removed to Taiyuan Commandery and the territory of the kingdom of Dai, where he defected to the Xiongnu and led raids against the Han Dynasty until his death. Culture and society Before the state of Qin unified China in 221 BC, each region had their own unique customs and culture, although they were all dominated by an upper class that shared a largely common culture. In the Yu Gong (Tribute of Yu), a section of the Book of Documents which was most likely composed in the 4th century BC, the author describes a China that is divided into nine regions, each with its own distinctive peoples and products. The core theme of this section is that these nine regions are unified into one state by the travels of the eponymous sage, Yu the Great and by sending each region's unique goods to the capital as tribute. Other texts also discussed these regional variations in culture and physical environments. One of these texts was Wuzi (The Book of Master Wu) which was a Warring States military treatise written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the other states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were linked to the physical environment and territory they live in.

It is the sequel to Adventure Island and the second game in the series for the NES. While the first game was an adaptation of Sega's Wonder Boy arcade game, Adventure Island II is an original work, as were all the subsequent Adventure Island games.http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/vc/adventure_island_ii_nes A portable version was also released for the Game Boy in 1992 titled Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima II or Adventure Island outside of Japan.http://ca.ign.com/articles/2011/12/02/adventure-island-review Plot Master Higgins' girlfriend Tina, has just been kidnapped by the Evil Witch Doctor's persistent followers. Eight perilous islands are in control of the various monster minions, although four friendly dinosaurs will gladly ally themselves with those willing to brave the islands' dangers and defeat their common oppressors. Thinking of how grateful his favorite lady will be when he comes to her rescue, Master Higgins embarks on a daunting quest to get to his honey. Gameplay The rules of the game are the same as those in the original Adventure Island, with the main new feature being the addition of an inventory system. Before the player begins a stage, he can choose which of Higgins' animal friends to bring (if he has rescued any), as well as whether or not he should bring one of the stone hammers he has accumulated. Because of this, the player can no longer upgrade to shooting fireballs when he picks a second hammer. Instead, it gets added as a reserved hammer to the player's inventory. The checkpoint system has been eliminated and if the player dies in the middle of a stage, he must restart from the very beginning. However, the stages are significantly shorter than in the previous game. When the player strikes a place where a hidden egg is located, it will play a different noise that will serve as an indicator of its location. The bonus zones are now accessed by picking up a key located inside these hidden eggs. Some of these keys will also transport the player to an item room or a shortcut to the next island. There are now underwater stages, as well as vertical-scrolling stages. When the player completes a stage riding a skateboard, he does not get to take it to the next stage like he could in the previous game. When the player completes a stage, he will be asked to choose one of ten spinning eggs that will give him a certain number of points. The player can now backtrack during a stage as well, but only up to a certain point. The boss of each island awaits the player on a specific stage at the beginning. However, if the player is defeated while fighting a boss, the boss will move to another area, forcing the player not only to clear his current stage, but also another one in order to fight the boss. There are four types of dinosaur friends that Higgins can ride. These animal friends are summoned when the player collects a playing card suit hidden inside an egg. The blue camptosaurus (summoned by a heart card) attacks with his tail and can walk on ice without sliding; the red camptosaurus (spade) can breathe fire and swim over lava until a certain point; the pteranodon (clover) can fly over obstacles and drop stones; and the elasmosaurus (diamond) is the only dinosaur that can survive in underwater stages (the others will be lost when used underwater) and can help Higgins swim faster. Reception Allgame editor Skyler Miller praised the game over the original, specifically its \\"improved graphics, a map screen, and most importantly, four dinosaur buddies for Master Higgins to ride, each with their own special ability\\".

History The company was founded in 2016 by two Harvard University undergraduates, Eva Shang and Christian Haigh, as an analytics service to help law firms lookup court records, and evaluate cases based on data gathered from those records. A Thiel Fellow, Shang received $100,000 of initial funding to start the business from Peter Thiel's Thiel Foundation. Prior to launching at that year's Summer Y Combinator Demo Day, the founders decided to refocus the company on funding small business lawsuits directly, rather than helping lawyers or outside investors to do so. In November 2017, Forbes Magazine included Legalist's founders in its \\"30 Under 30\\" Law & Policy list and reported that Legalist had raised $10.25 million over the summer. In September 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Legalist had raised and closed its second fund of $100 million. In April 2020, AngelList named Legalist among the 52 best startups to watch out for. Service Lawyers representing business plaintiffs apply for funding of their cases via the Legalist website, or through an integration with Clio, a case management software package. The company then evaluates cases with a proprietary algorithm that estimates the likely duration of the case, and odds of winning, based on factors such as the judge, court type, lawyers for both parties, and other facts about the case. Factors such as how many cases a judge is hearing help the company estimate how long the case will take. The company primarily focuses on funding commercial litigation cases brought by small businesses. Based on its guidelines for risk and expected return, the company then decides whether or not to underwrite the case in amounts up to $1 million, with the assistance of the company's two underwriting attorneys.

He is said to be the \\"grandson of heaven\\" and \\"son of a bear\\", and to have founded the kingdom in 2333 BC. The earliest recorded version of the Dangun legend appears in the 13th-century Samguk Yusa, which cites China's Book of Wei and Korea's lost historical record Gogi (Í≥†Í∏∞, ).ÌïúÍµ≠ Î∏åÎ¶¨ÌÉúÎãàÏª§ Ïò®ÎùºÏù∏ ‚ÄòÎã®Íµ∞‚Äô Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online Korea ‚ÄòÎã®Íµ∞ Dangun‚Äô There are around seventeen religious groups that focus on the worship of Dangun.  Myth  Dangun's ancestry legend begins with his grandfather Hwanin (ÌôòÏù∏/), the \\"Lord of Heaven\\". Hwanin had a son, Hwanung (ÌôòÏõÖ/ Hanja: Ê°ìÈõÑ), who yearned to live on the earth among the valleys and the mountains. Hwanin permitted Hwanung and 3,000 followers to descend onto Baekdu Mountain, where Hwanung founded the Sinsi (Ïã†Ïãú/ Hanja: Á•ûÂ∏Ç, \\"City of God\\"). Along with his ministers of clouds, rain and wind, he instituted laws and moral codes and taught humans various arts, medicine, and agriculture.The Story of Dan-gun Legend attributes the development of acupuncture and moxibustion to Dangun. A tiger and a bear prayed to Hwanung that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them twenty cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.http://www.san-shin.org/Dan-gun_Myth.html The bear-woman (Ungnyeo; ÏõÖÎÖÄ/ Hanja: ) was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. However, she lacked a husband, and soon became sad and prayed beneath a \\"divine birch\\" tree () to be blessed with a child. Hwanung, moved by her prayers, took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named Dangun Wanggeom. Dangun ascended to the throne, built the walled city of Asadal situated near Pyongyang (the location is disputed) and called the kingdom Joseon‚Äîreferred to today as Gojoseon \\"Old/Ancient Joseon\\" (Í≥†Ï°∞ÏÑ†, Hanja: Âè§ÊúùÈÆÆ) so as not to be confused with the later kingdom of Joseon (Ï°∞ÏÑ†, Hanja: ÊúùÈÆÆ) that was established much later. He then moved his capital to Asadal on Mount Paegak or Mount Gunghol. = Dating = Emperor Dangun's rule is usually calculated to begin in 2333 BCE, based on the description of the Dongguk Tonggam (1485) contrary to the 40th year of the reign of the legendary Chinese Emperor Yao. Other sources vary somewhat, but also put it during Yao's reign (traditional dates: 2357 BC-2256 BC). The Samguk Yusa states Dangun ascended to the throne in the 50th year of Yao's reign, while Annals of the Joseon Dynasty says the first year and Dongguk Tonggam says the 25th year. A South Korean postage stamp in 1956 (Dangi 4289) Until 1961, the official South Korean era (for numbering years) was called the Dangi (), which began in 2333 BC. Followers of Daejongism considered October 3 in the Korean calendar as Gaecheonjeol ( \\"Festival of the Opening of Heaven\\"). This day is now a public holiday in South Korea in the Gregorian calendar called \\"National Foundation Day\\". North Korea dates Dangun's founding of Gojoseon to the early 30th century BC.KCNA 15 March in the year 4340 of the Dangun Era is called \\"Royal Day Festival\\" (hangul: Ïñ¥Ï≤úÏ†à hanja: romaja: eo-cheon-jeol), the day that the semi-legendary founder Dangun returned to the heavens.  Appearances  Statue near Daecheong Dam in Daejeon, South Korea The earliest recorded version of the Dangun legend appears in the 13th century Samguk Yusa (ÏÇºÍµ≠Ïú†ÏÇ¨/ Hanja: ‰∏âÂúãÈÅ∫‰∫ã), which cites China's Book of Wei and Korea's lost history text Gogi (Í≥†Í∏∞/ Hanja: ). This is the best known and most studied version, but similar versions are recorded in the Jewang Un-gi (Ï†úÏôïÏö¥Í∏∞/ Hanja: Â∏ùÁéãÈüªÁ¥Ä) by the late Goryeo scholar Yi Seunghyu (Ïù¥ÏäπÌú¥/ Hanja: , 1224-1300), as well as the Eungje Siju (ÏùëÏ†úÏãúÏ£º/ Hanja: ÊáâË£ΩË©©Ë®ª) and Sejong Sillok (ÏÑ∏Ï¢ÖÏã§Î°ù; commonly known as \\"Annals of the Joseon Dynasty\\", Sejong Jang-heon Dae-wang Shil-lok ÏÑ∏Ï¢ÖÏû•ÌóåÎåÄÏôïÏã§Î°ù/ Hanja: ‰∏ñÂÆóËéäÊÜ≤Â§ßÁéãÂØ¶ÈåÑ) of the early Joseon. Dangun is worshipped today as a deity by the followers of Cheondoism and Daejongism. =In Taekwondo= Dangun is the second pattern or hyeong in the International Taekwon-Do Federation form of the Korean martial art taekwondo. Students learn that the hyeong represents \\"the holy legendary founder of Korea in the year 2333 BC.\\" Unusually for a hyeong, all the punches in Dan Gun are high section (eye level) symbolising Dangun scaling a mountain (see Dangun Hyeung).  Mausoleum of Dangun  North Korea's leader Kim Il-sung insisted that Dangun was not merely a legend but a real historical person. As consequence, North Korean archaeologists were compelled to locate the purported remains and grave of Dangun. According to a publication by North Korea, the Mausoleum of Dangun is the alleged burial site of the legendary Dangun. The site occupies about 1.8 km¬≤ (0.70 mi¬≤) on the slope of Taebaek Mountain in Kangdong, not to be confused with the Taebaek Mountain in South Korea. Dangun's grave is shaped like a pyramid, about 22 m (72 ft) high and 50 m (164 ft) on each side. Many observers and historians outside of North Korea, including South Korea, consider the site controversial.

The game is based upon the Palladium Books Megaversal system and is compatible with other games that use the Palladium system. Description The game features superheroes fighting supervillains in a comic book-like world. The game's introduction states that the game was designed to be a \\"thinking man's\\" superhero role-playing game where the characters were vulnerable and could not amass an incredible number of skills or abilities. The experience point system of the game gave great awards to novel thinking and heroic sacrifice, in addition to defeating one's enemies. Characters in the game are defined by their ability scores, skills (dependent on education level), and class, which allows the selection of certain powers or enhanced skills or equipment. The classes allowed for a wide range of play-types, from super-powered beings to aliens to technology-based or special-training-based characters. However, the character creation system was widely divergent ‚Äì some classes such as robotics allowed intense customization, while others were extremely random. Some classes and super powers (such as the ancient master class or the invulnerability power) started very powerful but hardly matured, while other classes and powers had effects strongly tied to character level. The revised edition added new powers and minor rule changes, allowed many classes to take \\"minor\\" superpowers to slightly expand play options, introduced the option of \\"crazy\\" heroes, and most notably added magic-powered characters to the game at the request of the players. The revised edition also included a short rules summary of the Palladium game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness, adding mutant animal character rules and a shortened selection of animals for character creation. However, mutant animals make characters that are in general much weaker than standard heroes, as the TMNT supplement Turtles Go Hollywood noted. The second edition of the game saw something of a renaissance in the line's production. In addition to the options previously provided, and updates of the previous supplements, Palladium Books produced several supplements for the game. Publication history Heroes Unlimited was first published by Palladium Books in 1984 and revised in 1987.

Valpolicella is in the province of Verona, within the large Veneto region near Venice. In Italian, the name Amarone literally means \\"the Great Bitter\\"; originally, this was to distinguish it from the Recioto produced in the same region, which is sweeter in taste.  History  Notable wines have been produced in Valpolicella since ancient times,Johnson, H., Vintage: The Story of Wine, p. 422, Simon and Schuster, 1989 but the Verona wine was not marketed as Amarone before 1953.Paolo Morganti, Sandro Sangiorgi. Amarone della Valpolicella. Morganti, 2003. P. 82. It is believed that the label Amarone was coined by Adelino Lucchese in 1936. The wine was assigned Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in December 1990. On 4 December 2009, Amarone and Recioto della Valpolicella were promoted to the status of Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG). Total production for sale (including Recioto) in 2008 was 8.57 million bottles. Process Grapes are harvested ripe in the first two weeks of October, by carefully choosing bunches having fruits not too close to each other, to let the air flow. Grapes are allowed to dry, traditionally on straw mats. This process is called appassimento or rasinate (to dry and shrivel) in Italian. This concentrates the remaining sugars and flavours and is similar to the production of French Vin de Paille. The pomace left over from pressing off the Amarone is used in the production of Ripasso Valpolicellas. Modern Amarone is produced in special drying chambers under controlled conditions. This approach minimizes the amount of handling of the grapes and helps prevent the onset of Botrytis cinerea. In Amarone, the quality of the grape skin is a primary concern, as that component brings the tannins, color, and intensity of flavor to the wine. The process of desiccation not only concentrates the juices within the grape, but also increases the skin contact of the grapes. The drying process creates a polymerization of the tannins in the skin that contributes to the overall balance of the finished wine.J. Robinson editor The Oxford Companion to Wine pg 19 Oxford University Press 2006 Typically, the length of the drying process is 120 days, but varies according to producer and the quality of the harvest. The most evident consequence of this process is the loss of weight: 35 to 45% for Corvina grapes, 30 to 40% for Molinara, and 27 to 40% for Rondinella. Following the drying process that is completed during the end of January or beginning of February, the grapes are crushed and go through a dry, low temperature fermentation process that may last up to 30 or 50 days. The reduced water content can slow down the fermentation process, increasing the risk of spoilage and potential wine faults such as high volatile acidity. After fermentation, the wine is aged in barriques made of either French or Slavonian oak. =Variations= If fermentation is stopped early, the resulting wine will contain residual sugar (more than 4 grams of sugar per litre) and produce a sweeter wine known as Recioto della Valpolicella. Recioto was the traditional wine produced according to this method, and originally, Amarone was Recioto wines that had fermented for too long. Unlike Amarone, Recioto della Valpolicella may be used to produce a sparkling wine.M. Ewing- Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wine for Dummies pg 124 Hungry Minds Inc 2001 Ripasso is an Italian wine produced when the partially-aged Valpolicella is contacted with the pomace of the Amarone. Typically, this will take place in the spring following the harvest. The resulting wine is more tannic, with a deeper color, and having more alcohol and more extract. The word Ripasso designates both the winemaking technique and the wine, and usually is found on a wine label. Characteristics and faults The final result is a very ripe, raisiny, full-bodied wine with very little acid. Alcohol content easily surpasses 15% (the legal minimum is 14%) and the resulting wine is rarely released until five years after the vintage, even though this is not a legal requirement. The labor-intensive process of producing this wine poses significant risk for the development of various wine faults. Wet and rainy weather during harvest may cause the grapes to rot before drying out, requiring winemakers to be diligent in removing rotted bunches that can cause moldy flavors in the wine.K.

They begin at the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula, about south of Miami, and extend in a gentle arc south-southwest and then westward to Key West, the westernmost of the inhabited islands, and on to the uninhabited Dry Tortugas. The islands lie along the Florida Straits, dividing the Atlantic Ocean to the east from the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and defining one edge of Florida Bay. At the nearest point, the southern part of Key West is just from Cuba. The Florida Keys are between about 24.3 and 25.5 degrees North latitude. More than 95 percent of the land area lies in Monroe County, but a small portion extends northeast into Miami-Dade County, such as Totten Key. The total land area is . As of the 2010 census the population was 73,090 with an average density of , although much of the population is concentrated in a few areas of much higher density, such as the city of Key West, which has 32% of the entire population of the Keys. The US Census population estimate for 2014 is 77,136. The city of Key West is the county seat of Monroe County. The county consists of a section on the mainland which is almost entirely in Everglades National Park, and the Keys islands from Key Largo to the Dry Tortugas. History Lower Matecumbe Key to Key Largo, captured by Sentinel-2 satellite Key West to Big Pine Key, seen from Sentinel-2 satellite The Keys were originally inhabited by the Calusa and Tequesta tribes, and were charted by Juan Ponce de Le√≥n in 1513. De Le√≥n named the islands Los Martires (\\"The Martyrs\\"), as they looked like suffering men from a distance.Journal of Antonio de Herrera quoted in Goodwin- Nguyen, S (2008) Key West: A Comprehensive Guide to Florida's Southernmost City, Channel Lake, p. 19. \\"Key\\" is derived from the Spanish word cayo, meaning small island. For many years, Key West was the largest town in Florida, and it grew prosperous on wrecking revenues. The isolated outpost was well located for trade with Cuba and the Bahamas and was on the main trade route from New Orleans. Improved navigation led to fewer shipwrecks, and Key West went into a decline in the late nineteenth century. =Overseas Railway= The Keys were long accessible only by water. This changed with the completion of Henry Flagler's Overseas Railway in the early 1910s. Flagler, a major developer of Florida's Atlantic coast, extended his Florida East Coast Railway down to Key West with an ambitious series of oversea railroad trestles. Three hurricanes disrupted the project in 1906, 1909, and 1910. =1935 Labor Day hurricane= The strongest hurricane to strike the U.S. made landfall near Islamorada in the Upper Keys on Labor Day, Monday, September 2, 1935. Winds were estimated to have gusted to , raising a storm surge more than above sea level that washed over the islands. More than 400 people were killed, though some estimates place the number of deaths at more than 600. The Labor Day hurricane was one of only four hurricanes to make landfall at Category 5 strength on the U.S. coast since reliable weather records began (about 1850). The other storms were Hurricane Camille (1969), Hurricane Andrew (1992), and Hurricane Michael (2018). In 1935, new bridges were under construction to connect a highway through the entire Keys. Hundreds of World War I veterans working on the roadway as part of a government relief program were housed in non-reinforced buildings in three construction camps in the Upper Keys. When the evacuation train failed to reach the camps before the storm, more than 200 veterans perished. Their deaths caused anger and charges of mismanagement that led to a Congressional investigation. The storm also ended the 23-year run of the Overseas Railway; the damaged tracks were never rebuilt, and the Overseas Highway (U.S. Highway 1) replaced the railroad as the main transportation route from Miami to Key West. =Seven Mile Bridge= One of the longest bridges when it was built, the Seven Mile Bridge connects Knight's Key (part of the city of Marathon in the Middle Keys) to Little Duck Key in the Lower Keys. The piling-supported concrete bridge is or 6.79 miles (10.93 km) long. The current bridge bypasses Pigeon Key, a small island that housed workers building Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway in the 1900s, that the original Seven Mile Bridge crossed. A section of the old bridge remains for access to the island, although it was closed to vehicular traffic on March 4, 2008. The aging structure has been deemed unsafe by the Florida Department of Transportation. Costly repairs, estimated to be as much as $34 million, were expected to begin in July 2008. Monroe County was unable to secure a $17 million loan through the state infrastructure bank, delaying work for at least a year. On June 14, 2008, the old bridge section leading to Pigeon Key was closed to fishing as well. While still open to pedestrians‚Äîwalking, biking and jogging‚Äîif the bridge were closed altogether, only a ferry subsidized by FDOT and managed by the county would transport visitors to the island. =Overseas Highway= After the destruction of the Keys railway by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, the railroad bridges, including the Seven Mile Bridge, were converted to automobile roadways. This roadway, U.S. Highway 1, became the Overseas Highway that runs from Key Largo south to Key West. Today this unique highway allows travel through the tropical islands of the Florida Keys and view exotic plants and animals found nowhere else on the US mainland and the largest coral reef chain in the United States. =Cuban exiles= Following the Cuban Revolution, many Cubans emigrated to South Florida. Key West traditionally had strong links with its neighbor ninety miles south by water, and large numbers of Cubans settled there. The Keys still attract Cubans leaving their home country, and stories of \\"rafters\\" coming ashore are not uncommon. =Conch Republic= In 1982, the United States Border Patrol established a roadblock and inspection points on US Highway 1, stopping all northbound traffic returning to the mainland at Florida City, to search vehicles for illegal drugs and undocumented immigrants. The Key West City Council repeatedly complained about the roadblocks, which were a major inconvenience for travellers, and hurt the Keys' important tourism industry. After various unsuccessful complaints and attempts to get a legal injunction against the blockade failed in federal court in Miami, on April 23, 1982, Key West mayor Dennis Wardlow and the city council declared the independence of the city of Key West, calling it the \\"Conch Republic\\". After one minute of secession, he (as \\"Prime Minister\\") surrendered to an officer of the Key West Naval Air Station (NAS), and requested one billion ($1,000,000,000) dollars in \\"foreign aid\\".The Conch Republic The stunt succeeded in generating great publicity for the Keys' plight, and the inspection station roadblock was removed. The idea of the Conch Republic has provided a new source of revenue for the Keys by way of tourist keepsake sales, and the Conch Republic has participated in later protests. Geology The northern and central sections of the Florida Keys are the exposed portions of an ancient coral reef, the Key Largo Limestone. The northernmost island arising from the ancient reef formation is Elliott Key, in Biscayne National Park. North of Elliott Key are several small transitional keys, composed of sand built up around small areas of exposed ancient reef. Further north, Key Biscayne and places north are barrier islands, built up of sand. U.S. National Park Service Link recovered from Internet Archive December 23, 2010 Blank, Joan Gill. 1996. Key Biscayne. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press, Inc. . P. 150. The islands in the southwestern part of the chain, from Big Pine Key to the Marquesas Keys, are exposed areas of Miami Limestone. The Florida Keys have taken their present form as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or ice ages. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels about feet above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida Platform, stretching south and then west from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas. This reef formed the Key Largo limestone that is exposed on the surface from Soldier Key (midway between Key Biscayne and Elliott Key) to the southeast portion of Big Pine Key and the Newfound Harbor Keys. The types of coral that formed Key Largo limestone can be identified on the exposed surface of these keys. Starting about 100,000 years ago the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the coral reef and surrounding marine sediments. By 15,000 years ago the sea level had dropped between below the contemporary level. The exposed reefs and sediments were heavily eroded. Acidic water, which can result from decaying vegetation, dissolves limestone. Some of the dissolved limestone redeposited as a denser cap rock, which can be seen as outcrops overlying the Key Largo and Miami limestones throughout the Keys. The limestone that eroded from the reef formed oolites in the shallow sea behind the reef, and together with the skeletal remains of bryozoans, formed the Miami Limestone that is the current surface bedrock of the lower Florida peninsula and the lower keys from Big Pine Key to Key West. To the west of Key West the ancient reef is covered by recent calcareous sand. While the islands of the upper and middle keys form a long narrow arc, the islands of the lower keys are perpendicular to the line of that arc. This configuration arose from an ancient tidal-bar system. The bars lithified and with changes in sea level are presently exposed as the islands, while the channels between the bars now separate the islands. Just offshore of the Florida Keys along the edge of the Florida Straits is the Florida Reef (also known as the Florida Reef Tract). The Florida Reef extends 270 km from Fowey Rocks just east of Soldier Key to just south of the Marquesas Keys. It is the third-largest barrier reef system in the world.Florida NOAA's Coral Reef Information System Accessed December 14, 2010. Environment Royal Poinciana tree in full bloom in the Florida Keys. The Coconut palm trees are grown all over South Florida.\\"The Coconut Palm in Florida\\", Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida Sunset near Marathon The climate and environment of the Florida Keys are closer to that of the Caribbean than the rest of Florida, though unlike the Caribbean's volcanic islands, the Keys were built by plants and animals. The Upper Keys islands are composed of sandy-type accumulations of limestone grains produced by plants and marine organisms. The Lower Keys are the remnants of large coral reefs, which became fossilized and exposed when the sea level dropped. The natural habitats of the Keys are upland forests, inland wetlands and shoreline zones. Soil ranges from sand to marl to rich, decomposed leaf litter. In some places, \\"caprock\\" (the eroded surface of coral formations) covers the ground. Rain falling through leaf debris becomes acidic and dissolves holes in the limestone, where soil accumulates and trees root. = Flora and fauna = A male Key Deer on No Name Key in the lower Keys The Florida Keys have distinctive plant and animals species, some found nowhere else in the United States, as the Keys define the northern extent of their ranges. The climate also allows many imported plants to thrive. Nearly any houseplant known to commerce, and most landscape plants of the South, can thrive in the Keys climate. Some exotic species which arrived as landscape plants now invade and threaten natural areas. The native flora of the Keys is diverse, including members of both temperate families, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa) and oaks (Quercus spp.), growing at the southern end of their ranges, and tropical families, including mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba), stoppers (Eugenia spp.), Jamaican dogwood (Piscidia piscipula), and many others, which grow only in tropical climates. Several types of palms are native to the Florida Keys, including the Florida thatch palm Thrinax radiata, which grows to its greatest size in Florida on the islands of the Keys. The Keys are also home to unique animal species, including the American crocodile, Key deer, protected by the National Key Deer Refuge, and the Key Largo woodrat. The Keys is the northernmost range of the American crocodile, which is endemic from South America to Panama, north to the Florida Keys. The Key Largo Woodrat is found only in the northern part of its namesake island, and is a focus of management activities in Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge. About 70 miles (110 km) west of Key West is Dry Tortugas National Park, one of the most isolated and therefore well-preserved in the world. The waters surrounding the Keys are part of a protected area known as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Climate The climate of the Florida Keys is tropical savanna (K√∂ppen climate classification: Aw).K√∂ppen Climate Classification Map on John Abbott College. Other than some areas of coastal Miami (Miami Beach), the Florida Keys are the only areas in the continental United States to never report freezing temperatures since settlement. The record low in Key West is (in both 1886 and 1981), and low temperatures below are rare. Most of the Florida Keys fall into USDA zone 11a to 11b (upper Key Largo is 10b). There are two main \\"seasons\\" in the Florida Keys, a hot and wet season from June through October, and a dry season from November though April, that features little rainfall, sunny skies, and warm breezy conditions. The warm and sunny winter climate, with average highs around and lows above , is the main tourist season in the Florida Keys. Key West is the driest city in Florida, and most of the Florida Keys can become quite dry at the height of the dry season. Some of the more exposed vegetation in the keys is scrub, stunted due to the intense sun, quick draining sandy soil, and arid winter climate. =Tropical cyclones= Typical current flows throughout the Florida Keys (NOAA June 2010) The Keys are occasionally threatened by tropical storms and hurricanes, leading to evacuations to the mainland. Hurricane Georges, after destroying much of the housing and infrastructure on many of the Caribbean islands, caused damage and extensive flooding in the Lower Keys in 1998, before making landfall in Mississippi. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma affected the Keys (although none made a direct hit), causing widespread damage and flooding. The most severe hurricane to hit the area was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, a Category 5 hurricane. Tropical cyclones present special dangers and challenges to the entire Keys. Because no area of the islands is more than above sea level (and many are only a few feet elevation), and water surrounds the islands, nearly every neighborhood is subject to flooding as well as hurricane winds. In response, many homes in the Keys are built on concrete stilts with the first floor being not legally habitable and enclosed by breakaway walls that are not strongly attached to the rest of the house. Nonetheless, Monroe County, as reported in the Federal Register, has estimated that there are between 8,000 and 12,000 illegal enclosures inhabited by people. Because of the threat from storm surge, evacuations are routinely ordered when the National Weather Service issues a hurricane watch or warning, and are sometimes ordered for a tropical storm warning. Evacuation of the Keys depends on causeways and the two-lane highway to the mainland. Time estimates for evacuating the entire Keys range from 12 to 24 hours. Evacuation estimates are significant in emergency planning, of course, but also because they are a factor in local and state regulations for controlling development. The building permit allocation was increased in 2005 when local governments reduced estimates for evacuation. On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key. The storm destroyed an estimated 25% of the houses on the Keys and another 65% suffered major damage. Most residents had evacuated before the storm hit the area. On September 12, parts of the Keys were still inaccessible by causeway and some areas were closed to the public. Governor Rick Scott reported devastation; most areas were without power or water. The damage was the worst in the Lower Keys, though less severe in Key West; parts of the Lower Keys may be uninhabitable for months.

Transportation The Seven Mile Bridge is part of the Overseas Highway. The main chain of Keys islands can be traveled by motor vehicles on the Overseas Highway, a section of U.S. 1, which runs from Key West to Fort Kent, Maine in its entirety. The highway was built parallel to the original route of the Overseas Railway, which was not rebuilt following the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. Even before the hurricane, road sections and highway bridges allowed automobile traffic to travel from Miami to Lower Matecumbe Key, where a car ferry connected with another roadway section through the Lower Keys. Following the hurricane, some of the original railway bridges were converted to carry the highway roadbeds. These bridges were used until the 1980s, when new highway bridges were built alongside. Many of the original railroad and highway bridges remain today as pedestrian fishing piers. =Public transportation= The Florida Keys has public bus transportation. =Road hazards= Despite this reconstruction, U.S. 1 was not widened on a large scale, and today most of the route consists of just two lanes.

Biography Gal was born in Weimar, Germany to Miele and Erich Glas. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 he moved first to the United Kingdom and later, in 1936, to Kibbutz Yagur in the British Mandate of Palestine where he changed his name to Uziel Gal. In 1943, he was arrested for illegally carrying a gun and sentenced to six years in prison. However, he was pardoned and released in 1946, serving less than half of his sentence. Gal began designing the Uzi submachine gun shortly after the founding of Israel and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In 1951, it was officially adopted by the Israel Defense Forces and was called the Uzi after its creator. Gal did not want the weapon to be named after him but his request was denied. In 1955, he was decorated with Tzalash HaRamatkal and in 1958, Gal was the first person to receive the Israel Security Award, presented to him by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for his work on the Uzi. Gal retired from the IDF in 1975, and the following year moved to the United States. He settled in Philadelphia so that his daughter, Tamar, who had serious brain damage, could receive extended medical treatment there. In the early 1980s, Gal assisted in the creation of the Ruger MP9 submachine gun. Gal continued his work as a firearms designer in the United States until his death from cancer in 2002. His body was flown back to Yagur, Israel for burial.

It provides facilities for accessing the file system, controlling input/output devices, loading and running program files, and a system allowing programs to handle interrupts and signals. GS/OS was included as a component of Apple IIGS System Software versions 4.0 through 6.0.1. GS/OS, unlike its predecessor, is written entirely in 16-bit code and was the first true 16-bit operating system for the IIGS. GS/OS includes a facility known as file system translators (FSTs) which allows it to support multiple on-disk file systems in a manner transparent to application programs, a feature not found in ProDOS or most other microcomputer operating systems at the time. It was usually used with the ProDOS file system (which was the only one from which it could be booted), but GS/OS also supports a variety of other file systems, including the Hierarchical File System used by the Mac OS. Other file system translators, in addition to ProDOS and HFS, include those for MS-DOS, High Sierra/ISO-9660, Apple DOS 3.3, and Pascal, albeit read-only (full read/write support had been planned but never completed). Another advantage of GS/OS over ProDOS 16 is that it was written in 16-bit code for the 65816 processor used in the IIGS, rather than primarily in 8-bit 6502 machine code that does not take advantage of the IIGS's unique features. It also extends the ProDOS file system to provide for resource forks on files similar to those used on the Apple Macintosh, which allows for programs to be written in a more flexible way. The big change from the previous versions of ProDOS is that GS/OS incorporates many features of the Macintosh System 5. In particular, GS/OS has a Finder, loadable fonts, plug-in device drivers (modem, printer, etc.). A command-line development environment called APW (Apple Programmer's Workshop) is available; much like the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop.

Goetz surrendered to police nine days later and was charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, and several firearms offenses. Initially Goetz was viewed by most as a victim and by some as a vigilante, and he received widespread public recognition and support. A grand jury refused to indict Goetz on the more serious charges, voting indictments only for criminal gun possession. However, public opinion about Goetz wavered due to statements and alleged damaging details of the incident that later were released by the prosecution. Goetz was then re-indicted by a second grand jury on more serious charges. At a later jury trial he was found guilty of one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm, for which he served eight months of a one-year sentence. In 1996, Cabey, who had been left paraplegic and brain damaged as a result of his injuries, obtained a civil judgment of $43 million against Goetz, though to date Cabey has yet to receive this money from Goetz. The incident sparked a nationwide debate on crime in major cities, the legal limits of self-defense based on Cabey being shot once or twice, and the extent to which the citizenry could rely on the police to secure their safety. Goetz, dubbed the \\"Subway Vigilante\\" by the New York press, came to symbolize New Yorkers' frustrations with the high crime rates of the 1980s. He was both praised and vilified in the media and public opinion. The incident has been cited as a contributing factor to the groundswell movement against urban crime and disorder, and successful National Rifle Association campaigns to loosen restrictions for concealed carrying of firearms. Context and background Bernhard Goetz stated that three years before the incident, he had been attacked in the Canal Street subway station, while transporting electronic equipment, by three youths who attempted to rob him. The attackers smashed Goetz into a plate- glass door and threw him to the ground, injuring his chest and knee. Goetz assisted an off-duty officer in arresting one of them; the other two attackers escaped. Goetz was angered when the arrested attacker spent less than half the time in the police station spent by Goetz himself, and he was angered further when this attacker was charged only with criminal mischief for ripping Goetz's jacket. Goetz subsequently applied for a permit to carry a concealed handgun, on the basis of routinely carrying valuable equipment and large sums of cash, but his application was denied for insufficient need. He bought a 5-shot .38-caliber revolver during a trip to Florida. Incident 2 train In the early afternoon of Saturday, December 22, 1984, four men from the Bronx‚ÄîBarry Allen, Troy Canty, and Darrell Cabey, all 19; and James Ramseur, 18‚Äîboarded a downtown 2 train (a Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue express). The teens, each of whom previously had been arrested and convicted at least once, stated they were on their way to rob a video arcade in Manhattan. When the train arrived at the 14th Street station in Manhattan, fifteen to twenty other passengers remained with them in R22 subway car 7657, the seventh car of the ten-car train. At the 14th Street station, Goetz entered the car through the rearmost door, crossed the aisle and took a seat on the long bench across from the door. Canty was across the aisle from him, lying on the long bench just to the right of the door. Allen was seated to Canty's left, on the short seat on the other side of the door. Ramseur and Cabey were seated across from the door and to Goetz's right, on the short seat by the conductor's cab. According to Goetz's statement to the police, approximately ten seconds later, Canty asked him, \\"How are you doing?\\" Goetz responded, \\"Fine.\\" According to Goetz, the four youths allegedly gave signals to each other, and shortly thereafter Canty and Allen rose from their seats and moved over to the left of Goetz, blocking him off from the other passengers in the car. Canty then said, \\"Give me five dollars.\\" Goetz subsequently pulled a handgun and fired multiple shots at the four youths, wounding all. Canty and Ramseur testified at the criminal trial that they were panhandling, and had only requested the money, not demanded it. Cabey did not testify and Allen took the Fifth Amendment. =Sequence of shots= Sources differ in reporting the sequence of shots fired, and whether Cabey was shot once or twice. The following are four versions from significant or reliable sources describing the sequence of shots: Cabey shot on the fourth shot At the Bronx civil trial, Goetz testified the first shot was Canty, Allen second, the third shot missed, Cabey fourth, and Ramseur fifth. The following similar shooting sequence is verbatim from Goetz's website: Goetz does a dry fire shooting demonstration (five shots in 1.0 seconds at 4 hypothetical targets on both sides of him) on the Biography Channel show Aftermath with William Shatner. Bernhard Goetz/Aftermath with William Shatner Cabey shot on the fourth and fifth shots Prior to the criminal trial, the media reported that Cabey had been shot on the fourth shot and then again on the fifth shot, with Goetz saying, \\"You don't look too bad, here's another,\\" or, \\"You seem all right, here's another.\\" This sequence of shots was discredited at the criminal trial when it was revealed that Cabey was shot once in the left side; however, some media still reported the false information long after the criminal trial. Cabey shot on the fifth shot \\"Speed is everything,\\" Goetz said in a videotaped statement made after he surrendered nine days later. He told police that while still seated, he planned a \\"pattern of fire\\" from left to right. He then stood, stepped clear of Canty, drew his revolver, turned back to Canty, and fired four shots, one at each man, then fired a fifth shot. At the civil trial years later he said, \\"I was trying to get as many of them as I could.\\" Other sources repeated Goetz's statements to New York City police as to the sequence of shots: Canty was shot first, then Allen, then Ramseur, then Cabey. In the related proceeding People v. Goetz, the New York Court of Appeals summarized the incident: According to his statements to police, Goetz checked the first two men to make sure that they had been \\"taken care of,\\" then upon seeing that the fourth man, Cabey, was now sitting down and seemed unhurt, said, \\"You seem to be all right, here's another,\\" and fired at him again. Cabey was hit only once, a fact not made known to Goetz or his attorneys until shortly before the trial. One bullet missed, fragmenting on the steel cab wall behind Cabey. (The missed shot would also be the basis of a charge of reckless endangerment of other passengers.) Time magazine's theory (April 8, 1985) Goetz said one of the \\"boys\\" made gestures that may have implied he had a weapon. Goetz rose and partly unzipped his jacket where the revolver was concealed, and plotted his \\"pattern of fire\\" for shooting them. He asked Canty what he had said, and he repeated his statement. At this, Goetz unzipped his jacket the rest of the way, drew the gun, assumed a combat stance gripping the revolver with both hands, and shot Canty through the center of his body. He then turned to shoot Allen who had tried to flee, hitting him in the back, and then shot Ramseur, wounding him in the chest and arm. He then shot again, at Cabey, but may have missed. According to Goetz he then approached Cabey and shot him on the ground; however, another witness disputed that Goetz shot Cabey a second time. =Cabey and the \\"here's another\\" issue= Cabey ended up slumped in the short seat in the corner of the car next to the conductor's cab.Photo ‚Äì interior of similar model car, an R-17 , New York Transit Museum ‚Äì Goetz car was an R-22 with fiberglass seating Whether Cabey was struck by the fourth shot or by the fifth was critical to Goetz's claim of self-defense; this issue was fiercely contested at trial. Medical testimony said that such an injury would render the lower half of Cabey's body instantly useless. According to the prosecution, the fourth shot missed; then Goetz shot a seated Cabey at point-blank range with the fifth. The defense theory of how Cabey ended up in the seat was that he was standing when hit by the fourth shot, then collapsed into the seat due to the lurching and swaying of the train, with the fifth shot being the shot that missed. A summary of Goetz's statements to the police had become public two months after the incident, drawing intense media coverage. Probably most damaging to Goetz's public support and to his claim of acting in self-defense was his statement that he had said, \\"You don't look so bad, here's another,\\" before firing at Cabey a second time. Media concentration on the summary's more damning portions created a public mindset that a wounded Cabey was shot a second time, with the second shot taken in a premeditated and deliberate way‚Äîan impression that stood uncorrected until the criminal trial two years later. The notion that Cabey was shot twice would still occasionally appear in mainstream sources over a decade later, as it did in a 1996 New York Times editorial. At trial, one witness testified that Goetz approached to within \\"two to three feet\\" of a seated Cabey, then demonstrated how Goetz stood directly in front of Cabey and fired downward, a description that matched Goetz's published statements. Eight other independent witnesses testified that all shots came in \\"rapid succession\\"; one of these said the firing lasted \\"about a second\\". None of the eight heard a pause before the final shot, and none saw Goetz standing in front of Cabey. Whether Goetz actually said aloud the words \\"You don't look so bad, here's another\\" or only thought them is still a matter of dispute. He has subsequently denied on several occasions making the statement.Severin Mevissen: Was macht eigentlich ... Bernhard Goetz? Stern 5/2008, p. 154. One source said, \\"In all probability, the defendant uttered these words only to himself and probably not even mouthing the words, but just saying them in his own mind as he squeezed the trigger that fifth time.\\" =Flight and surrender= The terrified passengers ran to the other end and out of the car, leaving behind the two women who had been closest to the shooting, fallen or knocked down by the exodus, and immobilized by fear. Goetz talked to them to make sure they were not injured, then was approached by the conductor of the train. Goetz told him, \\"They tried to rob me and I shot them.\\" The conductor asked whether Goetz was a police officer, receiving the reply, \\"No.\\" Some time after a brief conversation in which he refused to hand over his revolver, Goetz jumped to the tracks and ran south through the tunnel to the Chambers Street station, where he exited the system. He went home to gather some belongings, then rented a car and drove north to Bennington, Vermont, where he burned his blue jacket and dismantled the revolver, scattering the pieces in the woods north of town. He drove around New England for several days, registering at motels under various names and paying in cash. On December 26, an anonymous hotline caller told New York City police that Goetz matched the gunman's description, owned a gun, and had been mugged previously. On December 29, Goetz called his neighbor, Myra Friedman, who told him that police had come by his apartment looking for him, and had left notes asking to be contacted as soon as possible. He gave his side of the story to Friedman, and described his psychological state at the time: Goetz returned to New York City on December 30, turned in the car, picked up some clothing and business papers at his apartment, rented another car and drove back to New England. Shortly after noon the next day, he walked into the Concord, New Hampshire, police headquarters and told the officer on duty, \\"I am the person they are seeking in New York.\\" =Statements to police= Once the officer realized that Goetz was a genuine suspect, Goetz was given a Miranda warning and he waived his right to have an attorney present. After an interview that lasted over an hour, a Concord detective asked Goetz to consent to making an audiotaped statement. Goetz agreed, and a two-hour statement was recorded. That evening, New York City detectives and an assistant district attorney arrived in Concord, and Goetz submitted to a two-hour videotaped interview. Both interviews were eventually played back for the grand juries, the criminal trial, and a civil trial years later. When the audiotape was first played in open court, Goetz was described by The New York Times as \\"confused and emotional, alternately horrified by and defensive about his actions, and obsessed with justifying them.\\" In his statements, Goetz described his past mugging, in which he was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished. He called New York City \\"lawless\\" and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a \\"joke,\\" a \\"sham,\\" and \\"a disgrace\\". Goetz said that when the four youths he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being \\"beaten to a pulp\\" as well as being robbed. He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press. Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, \\"My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible.\\" Later in the tape, Goetz said, \\"If I had more bullets, I would have shot 'em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets.\\" He added, \\"I was gonna, I was gonna gouge one of the guys' [Canty's] eyes out with my keys afterwards\\", but said he stopped when he saw the fear in his eyes. At the criminal trial, Goetz's defense attorneys, Barry Slotnick and Mark M. Baker, argued that this and other extreme statements by Goetz were the product of emotion and an overactive imagination. Goetz was brought back to Manhattan on January 3, 1985 and arraigned on four charges of attempted murder, with bail set at $50,000. He was held in protective custody at the Rikers Island prison hospital. Refusing offers of bail assistance from the public and from his family, he posted bail with his own funds and was released on bond January 8. =Early reports= Because of the loudness of the shots inside the confined space of the subway car, there were initial witness reports that suggested the gun involved was a .357 Magnum revolver. Goetz alluded to these reports in a December 2004 interview on the Opie and Anthony radio show, saying that the first shot he fired that afternoon had been unusually loud in part because it was the first shot fired by the small-frame .38 caliber revolver after the factory tests, which \\"cleaned the barrel.\\" After the incident, reports spread that Goetz had been threatened with sharpened screwdrivers. This rumor was published as fact by some newspapers including The New York Times; however, neither Goetz nor the men made any such claim. During his subsequent statement to the police, Goetz expressed a belief that none of the young men had been armed. Paramedics and police did find a total of three screwdrivers on two of the men; when Canty testified at Goetz's criminal trial, he said they were to be used to break into video arcade change boxes and not as weapons. Shooter Bernhard Hugo Goetz was born in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of New York City's Queens borough on November 7, 1947, the son of Gertrude (n√©e Karlsberg) and Bernhard Willard Goetz, Sr. His parents were German immigrants who met in the U.S. His father was Lutheran; his mother, who was Jewish, converted to Lutheranism.George P. Fletcher, A crime of self-defense: Bernhard Goetz and the Law on Trial, p.10 While growing up, Goetz lived with his parents and three older siblings in Upstate New York, where his father ran a dairy farm and a bookbinding business. At the age of 12, he was sent to Switzerland, where he and his sister attended boarding schools. Goetz returned to the United States in 1965 for college, and earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and nuclear engineering from New York University. By this time, the family had relocated to Orlando, Florida; Goetz joined them and worked at his father's residential development business. He was briefly married. After his divorce, he moved back to New York City, where he started an electronics business out of his Greenwich Village apartment. Public reaction \\"The Subway Vigilante,\\" as Goetz was labeled by New York City media, was front-page news for months, partly due to the repressed passions the incident unleashed in New York and other cities. Public opinion tended to fall into one of three camps: Those in the first camp tended to believe Goetz's version of the incident, that he was aggressively accosted and surrounded by the four teenagers and feared he was about to be beaten and robbed. Those in the second camp tended to believe the version told by the four teenagers, that they were merely panhandling to get some money to play video games. A third camp believed that Goetz had indeed been threatened, but viewed the shooting as an unjustified overreaction. =Supporters= Supporters viewed Goetz as a hero for standing up to his attackers and defending himself in an environment where the police were increasingly viewed as ineffective in combating crime. The Guardian Angels, a volunteer patrol group of mostly black and Hispanic teenagers, collected thousands of dollars from subway riders toward a legal defense fund for Goetz. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a civil rights organization, supported Goetz. Its director, Roy Innis, a member of the National Rifle Association's governing board,\\"Roy Innis re-elected to NRA Board\\", NRAwinningteam.com. offered to raise defense money, saying Goetz was \\"the avenger for all of us,\\" and calling for a volunteer force of armed civilians to patrol the streets. The prior criminal convictions of three of the four men (and the published accounts of such) prevented them from gaining much sympathy from many people. A special hotline set up by police to seek information was swamped by calls supporting the shooter and calling him a hero. Harvard Professor of Government James Q. Wilson explained the broad sentiment by saying, \\"It may simply indicate that there are no more liberals on the crime and law-and-order issue in New York City, because they've all been mugged.\\" =Other viewpoints= Some believed the version of the incident as told by the four men ‚Äì that they were merely panhandling with neither intimidation nor threats of violence. This view was later discredited when Darrell Cabey, who had been paralyzed by Goetz's gunshot twelve years earlier, admitted in a newspaper interview with columnist Jimmy Breslin that his friends had indeed intended to rob Goetz, who looked like \\"easy bait\\". Some saw the incident as racial (with Goetz being white and the four young men black), and the jury verdict as a blow to race relations. Benjamin Hooks, director of the NAACP, said \\"The jury verdict was inexcusable. ... It was proven ‚Äì according to his own statements ‚Äì that Goetz did the shooting and went far beyond the realm of self-defense. There was no provocation for what he did.\\" Representative Floyd Flake agreed, saying, \\"I think that if a black had shot four whites, the cry for the death penalty would have been almost automatic.\\" Co-counsel for Cabey C. Vernon Mason, a candidate for district attorney who was later disbarred, said Goetz's actions were racist, as did the Rev. Al Sharpton. Organized demonstrators accused Goetz of genocide. Goetz's racial language about criminal activity on 14th Street, allegedly made at a community meeting 18 months before the shooting ‚Äì \\"The only way we're going to clean up this street is to get rid of the spics and niggers\\" ‚Äì was offered as evidence of racial motivation for the shooting. Black political and religious leaders twice called for Federal civil rights investigations. An investigation by the office of U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani determined that the impetus for the shooting had been fear, not race. In an interview with Stone Phillips of Dateline NBC, Goetz later admitted that his fear was enhanced due to the fact that the alleged muggers were black. Grand juries Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau asked a grand jury to indict Goetz on four counts of attempted murder, four of assault, four of reckless endangerment, and one of criminal possession of a weapon. Because they would have to be granted immunity from prosecution, neither Goetz nor the four men he shot were called to testify. The 23 jurors heard witnesses, considered the police report of the shooting, and studied transcripts and tapes of the sometimes conflicting statements Goetz made to police in New Hampshire. The jury refused to indict Goetz on the more serious charges, voting indictments only for unlawful gun possession ‚Äì one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, for carrying in public the loaded unlicensed gun used in the subway shooting, and two counts of possession in the fourth degree, for keeping two other unlicensed handguns in his home. The case was assigned to Judge Stephen Crane. The shootings initially drew wide support from a public fearful and frustrated with rising crime rates and the state of the criminal justice system. A month after the grand jury's decision, a report summarizing statements Goetz made to police became public, indicating he had fired one shot at each of the four men, then checked their condition, and seeing no blood on the fourth, said \\"You don't look so bad, here's another\\" and fired again. The media now wrote of a change in the public mood and demanded that Goetz be tried on the attempted murder and assault charges while suggesting approaches that would allow Morgenthau to convene a new grand jury. Public figures including New York State Governor Mario Cuomo raised questions based on the police summary. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania called for a special prosecutor. Stating that he had a new witness, Morgenthau obtained Judge Crane's authorization to convene a second grand jury, which heard testimony by Canty and Ramseur and indicted Goetz on charges of attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and weapons possession. Judge Crane later granted a motion by Goetz to dismiss the new indictments, based on alleged errors in the prosecutor's instructions to the jury regarding Goetz's defense of justification for the use of deadly force. A second factor in the dismissal was the judge's opinion that Canty and Ramseur \\"strongly appeared\\" to have perjured themselves, based on later public statements that they had intended to rob Goetz, and on a newspaper interview where Cabey stated that the other members of the group planned to frighten and rob Goetz because he \\"looked like easy bait\\". The judge allowed the weapons possession and reckless endangerment charges to stand. The New York Court of Appeals, in People v. Goetz, reversed Judge Crane's dismissal, affirming the prosecutor's charge to the grand jury that a defendant's subjective belief that he is in imminent danger does not by itself justify the use of deadly force. The court agreed with the prosecutor that an objective belief, one that would be shared by a hypothetical reasonable person, is also required. The appeals court further held that Judge Crane's opinion that the testimony of Canty and Ramseur was perjurious was speculative and inappropriate. All charges were reinstated, and the case was sent to trial. Trials =Criminal trial= The case was defended by Barry Slotnick and Mark M. Baker. Slotnick argued that Goetz's actions fell within the New York State's self-defense statute. Under Section 35.15, \\"A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person ... unless ... He reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit [one of certain enumerated predicate offenses, including robbery].\\" Goetz was tried before a Manhattan jury of 10 whites and 2 blacks, of whom 6 had been victims of street crime. He was acquitted of the attempted murder and first-degree assault charges and convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree ‚Äì carrying a loaded, unlicensed weapon in a public place. He was sentenced to six months in jail, one year's psychiatric treatment, five years' probation, 200 hours community service, and a $5,000 fine. An appellate court affirmed the conviction and changed the sentence to one year in jail without probation. The order of the appellate court was affirmed because the trial court had not erred in instructing the jury that, if it found the People had proved each of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it \\"must\\" find the defendant guilty. This was not a directed verdict. Goetz served eight months. =Civil trial= A month after the shootings, Cabey's lawyers William Kunstler and Ron Kuby filed a civil suit against Goetz.Text of Civil Complaint against Goetz Lectric Law Library The civil case was tried in 1996, over eleven years later, in the Bronx, with race as the dominant theme. During jury selection, Kuby asked the mostly non-white prospective jurors whether they had ever been discriminated against. Goetz admitted to previous use of racial language and to smoking PCP-laced marijuana during the 1980s. Kuby portrayed Goetz as a racist aggressor; Goetz's defense was that when surrounded he reacted in fear of being again robbed and beaten. Newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin testified that in a 1985 interview, Cabey denied his involvement in an attempted robbery, but said that Canty, Allen, and Ramseur intended to rob Goetz. The jury found that Goetz had acted recklessly and had deliberately inflicted emotional distress on Cabey. Jurors stated that Goetz shooting Cabey twice was a key factor in their decision. The jury awarded Cabey $43 million ‚Äì $18 million for pain and suffering and $25 million in punitive damages. Goetz subsequently filed for bankruptcy, saying that legal expenses had left him almost penniless. A judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court ruled that the $43 million jury award could not be discharged by the bankruptcy. Asked in 2004 whether he was making payments on the judgment, Goetz responded \\"I don't think I've paid a penny on that\\", and referred any questions on the subject to his attorney. Aftermath The New York State legal standard for the self-defense justification use of deadly force shifted after rulings in the case. New York State jurors are now told to consider a defendant's background and to consider whether a hypothetical reasonable person would feel imperiled if that reasonable person were the defendant.Opinion by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, People v. Goetz, 68 NY2d 96. After reaching an all-time peak in 1990, crime in New York City dropped dramatically through the rest of the 1990s. , New York City had statistically become one of the safest large cities in the U.S., with its crime rate being ranked 194th of the 210 American cities with populations over 100,000. New York City crime rates were comparable to those of the early 1960s. Goetz and others have interpreted the significance of his actions in the subway incident as a contributing factor precipitating the groundswell movement against crime in subsequent years. While that claim is impossible to verify, Goetz achieved celebrity status as a popular cultural symbol of a public disgusted with urban crime and disorder. Goetz occasionally gives media interviews about the 1984 subway incident that brought him into the public eye. In 2001 he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York City. In 2004, Goetz was interviewed by Nancy Grace on Larry King Live, where he stated his actions were good for New York City and forced the city to address crime. In 2010 he was interviewed and did a dry fire shooting demonstration on the inaugural episode of The Biography Channel's documentary show Aftermath with William Shatner. In March 1985 James Ramseur falsely reported to police that two men apparently hired by Goetz kidnapped and attempted to kill him, but was not prosecuted for this hoax. Ramseur was incarcerated at the time of the trial. He was convicted in 1986 of the previous year's rape, sodomizing, and robbery of a young pregnant woman. He was conditionally released in 2002, but was returned to prison for a parole violation in 2005. He finished his sentence in July 2010. In 2011, on the 27th anniversary of the shooting, James Ramseur died from a drug overdose at age 45. In November 2013 Goetz was arrested for allegedly selling marijuana; the charges were dismissed in September 2014.  In popular culture  Goetz and the shooting have endured in popular culture and inspired a number of creative works. * The Law & Order episodes \\"Subterranean Homeboy Blues\\" and \\"Self Defense\\" were based on the subway shooting incident. * The incident is mentioned in an episode of Criminal Minds, \\"A Real Rain\\" (season 1, episode 17), where a vigilante goes on a crime spree delivering justice to criminals who were wrongly acquitted. * Goetz is referenced by name in Billy Joel's 1989 single \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\", in Lou Reed's song \\"Hold On\\" from his 1989 album New York, and on \\"Stop the Train\\" from the 1989 Beastie Boys album Paul's Boutique. * The 1993 film Falling Down was partly inspired by the shooting. * The shooting inspired the plot of the 2019 film Joker, whose depiction of the Joker is partially based on Goetz. The titular character is a lower-class inner city resident who has been jumped and robbed multiple times, so he obtains a firearm to defend himself. When he gets jumped on the subway, he shoots and kills the perpetrators and flees the scene, with the shooting earning strong media coverage and the then-unknown perpetrator inadvertently becoming a folk hero among lower-class city residents who are angry about their poor living conditions. Todd Phillips, who wrote, produced and directed the film, grew up in New York and remembered the 1984 subway shooting from his youth.

It is used as a recreational drug due to its potent stimulant and euphoric effects and is considered to be addictive, with both physical and psychological withdrawal occurring if its use is discontinued after prolonged or high-dosage administration. It is usually snorted, but can be smoked, injected, or taken orally. Methcathinone is listed as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the United States' Controlled Substances Act, and as such it is not considered to be safe or effective in the treatment, diagnosis, prevention, or cure of any disease, and has no approved medical use. Possession and distribution of methcathinone for the purpose of human consumption is illegal under any/all circumstances in the United States and is either illegal or highly regulated in most jurisdictions worldwide. History Methcathinone was first synthesized in 1928 in the United States and was patented by Parke-Davis in 1957.US Patent 2802865 -ETHYLAMINOPROPIOPHENONE COMPOUNDS It was used in the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s as an anti-depressant (under the name –≠—Ñ–µ–¥—Ä–æ–Ω‚Äîephedrone). Methcathinone has long been used as a drug of abuse in the Soviet Union and Russia. Circa 1994, the United States government recommended to the UN Secretary-General that methcathinone should be listed as a Schedule I controlled substance in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.Erowid In parts of Europe methcathinone is not listed as a dangerous drug. In the United Kingdom it is listed as a Class B drug, but the Home Office is considering reclassifying it as Class A when it is dissolved in water for injection, as amphetamine is. Chemistry Methcathinone is a beta-keto N-methylamphetamine and is closely related to the naturally occurring compounds, cathinone and cathine. It is also very closely related to methamphetamine, differing by only the Œ≤-ketone substituent and differing from amphetamine by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone. Methcathinone possesses a chiral carbon atom, and therefore two enantiomers are possible. When it is made semi- synthetically from pseudo/ephedrine as a starting material, then only a single enantiomer is produced. Given that the chiral center has an alpha hydrogen and adjacent the carbonyl group, the molecule will racemize in solution via an enol intermediate. This process is known as keto‚Äìenol tautomerism. Methcathinone production utilizes the oxidation of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, the former being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of pseudoephedrine to methcathinone requires little chemistry experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize.The Clandestine Chemists Notebook Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is most commonly used as the oxidant. In clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using potassium permanganate is considered undesirable because of the low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant, however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures potassium permanganate can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with chromium (VI) compounds. Methcathinone as free base is very unstable; it easily loses its ketone group, which is substituted with a hydroxyl group, yielding pseudoephedrine, in the reverse of the typical synthesis reaction. Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the RŒ≤-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Additionally, a dimerization reaction has been observed in solutions of freebase methcathinone, which yields a biologically inactive compound.  Effects  Methcathinone hydrochloride increases spontaneous rodent locomotor activity, potentiates the release of dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain, and causes appetite suppression. Users can easily forget to consume fluids leading to increased thirst and dehydration. The effects of methcathinone are similar to those of methamphetamine, initially deemed to be less intense by the inexperienced user, and often more euphoric. The effects have been compared to those of cocaine, since it commonly causes hypertension (elevated blood pressure) and tachycardia (elevated heart rate). Reported effects include: * Feelings of euphoria * Increased alertness * Slurred speech * Shaking of the limbs * Increased heart rate * Increased blood pressure, risk of stroke or heart attack * Increased empathy and sense of communication * Both decreased and increased sexual function and desire * Bruxism The effects of methcathinone usually last from four to six hours. Pharmacology Methcathinone has very strong affinities for the dopamine transporter and the norepinephrine (noradrenaline) transporter. Its affinity for the serotonin transporter is less than that of methamphetamine. The C=O bond at the RŒ≤-position (directly right of the phenyl ring) is slightly polar, and as a result the drug does not cross the lipid blood‚Äìbrain barrier quite as well as amphetamine. Nevertheless, it is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Chronic high dosage use may result in acute mental confusion ranging from mild paranoia to psychosis. These symptoms typically disappear quickly if use is stopped. Anecdotal reports have provided some information on patterns of methcathinone use. The most common route of administration is via nasal insufflation (snorting). Other routes of administration include per os, IV injection and smoking. Illicit usage Methcathinone binges resemble amphetamine binges in that the user may not sleep or eat, and takes in little in the way of liquids. The methcathinone binge is followed by long periods of sleep, excess eating, long-lasting nosebleeds (insufflation of methcathinone is corrosive to the nasal mucosa in the same manner as its methamphetamine counterpart) and, in some cases, depression. Addiction In preclinical studies, methcathinone hydrochloride produces an abuse potential similar to that of the amphetamines. Methcathinone can be highly psychologically addictive, and can produce a methamphetamine- like withdrawal, which is somewhat less in intensity than methamphetamine. In drug discrimination studies, methcathinone hydrochloride evokes responses similar to those induced by both dextroamphetamine sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. When examined in particular pharmacological assays for psychomotor stimulant-like activity, both the dextrorotary and levorotary enantiomeric forms of methcathinone hydrochloride have been found to be pharmacologically active. In these assays, the l-form of methcathinone is more active than either d-methcathinone or dextroamphetamine (this is notable as the dextrorotary isomer is the more active isomer of both amphetamine and methamphetamine). Some street dealers are selling methcathinone as dextroamphetamine or methamphetamine but the drug is more dangerous to people who inject it than the more common amphetamine. Intravenous usage Injecting this substance has recently been associated with symptoms similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (manganism) due to the compound manganese dioxide which is a byproduct of synthesis with permanganate. Clinical use The Convention on Psychotropic Substances lists methcathinone as a Schedule I substance. * In the United States, methcathinone is listed as a Schedule I drug, for which there is no clinical use. * In the Netherlands, methylcathinone is listed as a Level I substance of the Opium Law, for which there is no clinical use. * In the United Kingdom, methcathinone is listed as a Class B drug with no clinical uses.

Smith is best known for his 23-year career at Fox News Channel, which he joined at its 1996 inception and served as chief anchor and managing editor of its breaking news division. Smith hosted several programs in his tenure at Fox News, including Fox Report, Studio B and Shepard Smith Reporting. Early life and education Smith was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the son of Dora Ellen Anderson, an English teacher, and David Shepard Smith Sr., a cotton merchant. He attended Marshall Academy in Holly Springs. After high school, his parents separated and he moved to Florida with his mother. He studied journalism at the University of Mississippi, where he left two credits shy of a degree to take a reporter job in Panama City, Florida. Smith delivered the university's 155th commencement address on May 10, 2008. Career =Local television= Smith's began his career in television with WJHG-TV in Panama City Beach, Florida. After reporting jobs at WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, WSVN in Miami and WCPX-TV (now WKMG-TV) in Orlando, Smith became a correspondent for A Current Affair. =Fox News= After working as a correspondent for Fox affiliate service News Edge, Smith joined Fox News Channel at its inception in 1996. At Fox News, Smith reported on the death of Princess Diana in 1997, President Bill Clinton's 1998 impeachment trial, the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, the 2001 execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In 2003, The Fox Report with Shepard Smith was ranked third among the top five U.S. cable news programs, and Smith tied for second with Dan Rather and Peter Jennings as the most-trusted news anchor on both network and cable news. On November 19, 2007, Smith signed a three-year contract for $7-$8 million per year. He renewed his contract with Fox on October 26, 2010 for another three years. On September 12, 2013, Smith became managing editor of Fox News breaking news division and the host of Shepard Smith Reporting. In November 2017, Smith infuriated some Fox News viewers when he countered claims that the Obama administration approved a deal allowing a Russian company to buy a Canadian company with mining interests in the US in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. Smith's reporting put him at odds with colleague and Fox News prime time host Sean Hannity, who had supported the claim against Hillary Clinton. On March 15, 2018, Fox News signed Smith to a multi-year contract. On October 11, 2019, Smith stunned viewers and colleagues when he announced on Shepard Smith Reporting that he was leaving the network. =CNBC= On July 8, 2020, the business and economic news network CNBC announced Smith would join the network as chief general news anchor and chief general breaking news anchor. Smith will also serve as the host of The News with Shepard Smith, a primetime general news program which will air weekdays at 7:00 p.m. ET and launch on September 30, 2020. According to a CNBC press release, the program will \\"[aim] to go beyond financial markets, 'to tell rich, deeply reported stories across the entire landscape of global news.'\\" CNBC had previously aired a similarly-named program in the same time slot, hosted by Brian Williams and later John Siegenthaler, from 2002 to 2004. =Post-Fox career= In a speech to the International Press Freedom Awards on November 21, 2019, Smith warned of authoritarian governments that make it dangerous and difficult for journalists to do their jobs, saying autocrats have learned to use online tools and social media to shore up their power. At the event, Smith gave $500,000 to the host organization, the Committee to Protect Journalists. =Appearances in film= Smith appeared as himself in the 1997 film Volcano. Video of Smith anchoring on Fox News during the opening moments of the March 2003 Iraq War was used in the film Fahrenheit 9/11. Additionally, archive footage of Smith anchoring Shepard Smith Reporting covering the 2016 US presidential election was used in the 2019 docudrama Bombshell. Personal life Smith married Virginia Donald, a University of Mississippi classmate, in 1987. They divorced in 1993 with no children. In 2017, Smith publicly announced he is gay and has a long-time boyfriend.

The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush- sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific ochropus is from Ancient Greek okhros, \\"ochre\\", and pous, \\"foot\\". The green sandpiper represents an ancient lineage of the genus Tringa; its only close living relative is the solitary sandpiper (T. solitaria). They both have brown wings with little light dots and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other scolopacids. Given its basal position in Tringa, it is fairly unsurprising that suspected cases of hybridisation between this species and the common sandpiper (A. hypoleucos) of the sister genus Actitis have been reported. Description Wintering adult near Hodal, Faridabad district, Haryana, (India) This species is a somewhat plump wader with a dark greenish-brown back and wings, greyish head and breast and otherwise white underparts. The back is spotted white to varying extents, being maximal in the breeding adult, and less in winter and young birds. The legs and short bill are both dark green. It is conspicuous and characteristically patterned in flight, with the wings dark above and below and a brilliant white rump. The latter feature reliably distinguishes it from the slightly smaller but otherwise very similar solitary sandpiper (T. solitaria) of North America. In flight it has a characteristic three-note whistle. Distribution and ecology Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden It breeds across subarctic Europe and east across the Palearctic and is a migratory bird, wintering in southern Europe, the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and tropical Africa. Food is small invertebrate items picked off the mud as this species works steadily around the edges of its chosen pond. This is not a gregarious species, although sometimes small numbers congregate in suitable feeding areas. Green sandpiper is very much a bird of freshwater, and is often found in sites too restricted for other waders, which tend to like a clear all-round view. It lays 2‚Äì4 eggs in an old tree nest of another species, such as a fieldfare (Turdus pilaris). The clutch takes about three weeks to hatch. The green sandpiper is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Widely distributed and not uncommon, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN on a global scale.

The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail- bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. They are mainly freshwater birds, often with brightly coloured legs as reflected in the English names of six species, as well as the specific names of two of these and the green sandpiper. They are typically associated with northern hemisphere temperate regions for breeding. Some of this group‚Äînotably the green sandpiper‚Äînest in trees, using the old nests of other birds, usually thrushes. The willet and the tattlers have been found to belong in Tringa; these genus changes were formally adopted by the American Ornithologists' Union in 2006.Pereira & Baker (2005), Banks et al. (2006) The present genus in the old, more limited sense was even further subdivided into Tringa proper and Totanus, either as subgenera or as full genera. The available DNA sequence data suggests however that neither of these is monophyletic and that the latter simply lumps together a number of more of less closely related apomorphic species. Therefore, it seems unwarranted to recognize Totanus even as a subgenus for the time being.Ballmann (1969), Pereira & Baker (2005) Species in taxonomic order These are listed in systematic sequence: * Green sandpiper, Tringa ochropus * Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria * Grey-tailed tattler, Tringa brevipes ‚Äì formerly Heteroscelus brevipes * Wandering tattler, Tringa incana ‚Äì formerly Heteroscelus incanus * Spotted redshank, Tringa erythropus * Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca * Common greenshank, Tringa nebularia * Willet, Tringa semipalmata ‚Äì formerly Catoptrophorus semipalmatus * Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes * Nordmann's greenshank, Tringa guttifer * Marsh sandpiper, Tringa stagnatilis * Common redshank, Tringa totanus * Wood sandpiper, Tringa glareola File:Spotted Redshank (Tringa erythropus) at Bharatpur I IMG 5552.jpgTringa legs are either red (spotted redshank, T. erythropus), ...

Together with these, they are related to the phalaropes, as well as the turnstones and calidrids.van Tuinen et al. (2004) The large genus Tringa and the two very small genera which are most closely related form a phylogeny similar to the situation found in many other shorebird lineages such as calidrids, snipes and woodcocks, or gulls. The same study has indicated that some morphological characters such as details of the furcula and pelvis have evolved convergently and are no indicators of close relationship. Similarly, the leg/foot color wildly varies between close relatives, with the spotted redshank, the greater yellowlegs, and the common greenshank for example being more closely related among each other than to any other species in the group; the ancestral coloration of the legs and feet was fairly certainly drab buffish as in e.g. the green sandpiper. On the other hand, the molecular phylogeny reveals that the general habitus and size as well as the overall plumage pattern are good indicators of an evolutionary relationship in this group. The Nordmann's greenshank, a rare and endangered species, was not available for molecular analyses. It is fairly aberrant and was formerly placed in the monotypic genus Pseudototanus. It appears closest overall to the semipalmata-flavipes and the stagnatilis-totanus-glareola groups, though it also has some similarities to the greater yellowlegs and common greenshank. =Fossil recordMl√≠kovsk√Ω (2002)= Fossil shanks are known since the Miocene, possibly even since the Eo-/Oligocene some 33-30 million years ago (mya) which would be far earlier than most extant genera of birds. However, it is uncertain whether Tringa edwardsi indeed belongs into the present-day genus or is a distinct, ancestral form. The time of the Tringa-Actitis-Xenus-Phalaropus divergence has been tentatively dated at 22 mya, the beginning of the Miocene;Paton et al. (2003) even if the dating is largely conjectural, it suggests that T. edwardsi does indeed not belong into the modern genus. Molecular datingPereira & Baker (2005)‚Äîwhich is not too reliable, however‚Äîindicates that the diversification into the known lineages occurred between 20 and 5 mya. The fossil record contains species formerly separated in Totanus from the Early Miocene onwards. Although these are usually known from very scant remains, the fact that apparently apomorphic Tringa as well as a putative phalarope are known from about 23-22 mya indicates that the shank-phalarope group had already diverged into the modern genera by the start of the Miocene. The biogeography of living and fossil species‚Äînotably, the rarity of the latter in well-researched North American sites‚Äîseems to suggest that Tringa originated in Eurasia. Time and place neatly coincide with the disappearance of the last vestiges of the Turgai Sea, and this process may well have been a major factor in the separation of the genera in the shank-phalarope clade. Still, scolopacids are very similar osteologically, and many of the early fossils of presumed shanks require revaluation. * ?Tringa edwardsi (Quercy Late Eocene/Early Oligocene of Mouillac, France) * ?Tringa gracilis (Early Miocene of WC Europe) ‚Äì calidrid? * ?Tringa lartetianus (Early Miocene of Saint-G√©rand-le-Puy, France) * Tringa spp. (Early Miocene of Ravolzhausen, Germany ‚Äì Early Pleistocene of Europe)Apparently at least three species at Str√°nsk√° sk√°la (Czech Republic, Early Pleistocene) for example: Ml√≠kovsk√Ω (2002) * ?Tringa grivensis (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France) * ?Tringa majori (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France) * ?Tringa minor (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint- Alban, France) ‚Äì includes \\"Erolia\\" ennouchii; calidriid? * ?Tringa grigorescui (Middle Miocene of CiobƒÉni≈£a, Romania) * ?Tringa scarabellii (Late Miocene of Senigallia, Italy) * Tringa sp. 1 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, USA) * Tringa sp. 2 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, USA) * ?Tringa numenioides (Early Pliocene of Odessa, Ukraine) * Tringa antiqua (Late Pliocene of Meade County, USA) * Tringa ameghini (Late Pleistocene of Talara Tar Seeps, Peru) \\"Tringa\\" hoffmanni is now in Ludiortyx.

Guant√°namo is served by the Caimanera port near the site of a U.S. naval base. The area produces sugarcane and cotton wool. These are traditional parts of the economy. History The city was founded in 1797 in the area of a farm named Santa Catalina. The toponym \\"Guant√°namo\\" means, in Ta√≠no language, \\"land between the rivers\\". Guant√°namo on EcuRed Geography The municipality is mountainous in the north, at Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, where it overlays the Sierra Maestra (mountains), and borders the Windward Passage of the Caribbean Sea in the south. It is crossed by the Bano, Guant√°namo, Yateras, Guaso, San Andr√©s, and Sabanalamar rivers. The city is spread with a square plan and is crossed in the middle by the Carretera Central highway. Guant√°namo Bay is a natural harbour south of it. The municipality borders with El Salvador, Niceto P√©rez, Caimanera, Yateras, Manuel Tames, and Sagua de T√°namo; this one in Holgu√≠n Province. It includes the villages of Argeo Mart√≠nez, Arroyo Hondo, Glorieta, Las Lajas, and Paraguay. Prior to 1976 it was divided into the barrios and villages Arroyo Hondo, Baitiquir√≠, Bano, Bayate, Caimanera, Camarones, Caridad, Corralillo, Cuatro Caminos, Filipinas, Glorieta, Gobierno, Guaso, Hospital, Indios, Isleta, Jaibo Abajo, Las Lajas, Macurijes, Mercado, Ocujal, Parroquia, Palma de San Juan, Rastro, Tiguabos, and V√≠nculo. After 1976 reform part of municipal territory was split in the municipalities of El Salvador, Niceto P√©rez, Caimanera, and San Antonio del Sur. =United States Naval Base= About 15 km away from the city lies the Guant√°namo Bay, a superior natural harbor which has been utilized by the United States since 1898, when it was captured from Spain in the Battle of Guant√°namo Bay. In 1903 Cuba leased it to the U.S. as it had committed to in the Cuban‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Relations, and remains the site of a US Navy base, as well as the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Demographics In 2004, the municipality of Guant√°namo had a population of 244,603. With a total area of , it has a population density of . =Famous Guantanameros= Notable natives of Guant√°namo include athletes Joel Casamayor, Erislandy Lara, Yuriorkis Gamboa, Yumileidi Cumb√°, Jaime Jefferson, Yargelis Savigne, Dayron Robles, Luis Del√≠s, Cuban-American gymnast Annia Hatch, musician Diamela del Pozo, and cosmonaut Arnaldo Tamayo M√©ndez. Transport The city is served by the Carretera Central highway, and is the eastern terminus of the A1 motorway, that is mainly under construction and will link Guant√°namo with Havana. The city airport \\"Mariana Grajales\\" is located near the villages of Las Lajas and Paraguay. The song \\"Guantanamera\\" \\"Guantanamera\\" (Spanish: \\"from Guant√°namo [feminine]\\", thus \\"woman from Guant√°namo\\") is perhaps the best known Cuban song and that country's most noted patriotic song. In 1966, a version by American vocal group The Sandpipers, based on an arrangement by Pete Seeger, became an international hit. The song was later also one of Cuban superstar singer Celia Cruz's biggest hits.

A member of the Democratic Party and a progressive, Warren has focused on consumer protection, economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. She was a Democratic candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election. Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors of bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written 11 books and more than 100 articles. Her first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals. During the late 2000s, Warren's national profile grew following her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and she proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama. In 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She won reelection by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl. On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election. She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020.  Early life, education, and family  Warren's high school graduation photo Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949. She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (n√©e Reed, 1912‚Äì1995), a homemaker, and Donald Jones Herring (1911‚Äì1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II. Warren has described her early family life as teetering \\"on the ragged edge of the middle class\\" and \\"kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails.\\" She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist. Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work. After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building. Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant. Warren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16. She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert \\"Jim\\" Warren, whom she had met in high school. Warren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM. She enrolled in the University of Houston and graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech pathology and audiology. The Warrens moved to New Jersey when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, Amelia. After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled in Rutgers Law School at Rutgers University‚ÄìNewark. She received her J.D. in 1976, and passed the bar examination shortly thereafter. Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander. The Warrens divorced in 1978, and two years later, Warren married law professor Bruce H. Mann on July 12, 1980, but kept her first husband's surname. Warren has three grandchildren through her daughter Amelia. On April 23, 2020, Warren announced on Twitter that her eldest brother, Don Reed Herring, had died of COVID-19 two days earlier. Career before elected office Warren in Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark's 1976 yearbook. In 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school (see above), Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school. During law school, Warren worked as a summer associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. After she received her J.D. and passed the bar examination, she decided to offer legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings. In the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to bankruptcy and middle-class personal finance. She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s. =Academic= Warren began her career in academia as a lecturer at Rutgers University, Newark School of Law (1977‚Äì78). She then moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978‚Äì83), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 1987 and was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught Sunday school. Warren in University of Texas School of Law's 1987 yearbook. Warren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the Notre Dame Law Review, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted. But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law. According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts. Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book As We Forgive Our Debtors in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as \\"worse than disillusionment\\" and \\"like being shocked at a deep-down level\\". In 2004, she published an article in the Washington University Law Review in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy. Warren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at Harvard Law School as Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996 she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not an administrator, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876, including moving expenses and an allowance in lieu of benefits contributions. , she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university. Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and commercial law. From 2005 to 2009 Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields. She began to rise in prominence in 2004 with an appearance on the Dr. Phil show, and published several books including The Two Income Trap. =Advisory roles= Warren's \\"A minimum-wage job saved my family\\" speech at the Economic Policy Institute, November 2015 (3:28) In 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission's chair, former congressman Mike Synar, asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren's during their school years. She helped draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers' right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed consumers' ability to file for bankruptcy. From 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion.. * Resignation announced in She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law, * a former vice president of the American Law Institute and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Warren's scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.'''''' =TARP oversight= Warren stands next to President Barack Obama as he announces Richard Cordray's nomination as the first director of the CFPB, July 2011. On November 14, 2008, U.S. Senate majority leader Harry Reid appointed Warren to chair the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The panel released monthly oversight reports evaluating the government bailout and related programs. During Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, AIG, bank stress tests, the impact of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics. =Consumer Financial Protection Bureau= Warren discussing the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the ICBA conference in 2011 Warren was an early advocate for creating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency. While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, financial institutions and Republican members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, in January 2012, Obama appointed former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray to the post in a recess appointment over Republican senators' objections. =Political affiliation= A close high- school friend told Politico in 2019 that in high school Warren was a \\"diehard conservative\\" and that she had since done a \\"180-degree turn and an about- face\\". One of her colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin said that at university in the early 1980s Warren was \\"sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude\\". Gary L. Francione, who had been a colleague of hers at the University of Pennsylvania, recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he \\"almost fell off [his] chair... She's definitely changed\\". Warren was registered as a Republican from 1991 to 1996. She voted Republican for many years. \\"I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets\\", she has said. But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in 1976, for Gerald Ford. Warren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed that neither should dominate. According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \\"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families. U.S. Senate (2013‚Äìpresent) 2012 Senate election results by municipality Senate campaign logo Warren at a campaign event, November 2012 =Elections= 2012 On September 14, 2011, Warren declared her intention to run for the Democratic nomination for the 2012 election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate. Republican Scott Brown had won the seat in a 2010 special election after Ted Kennedy's death. A week later, a video of Warren speaking in Andover went viral on the Internet. In it, Warren responds to the charge that asking the rich to pay more taxes is \\"class warfare\\" by saying that no one grew rich in the U.S. without depending on infrastructure paid for by the rest of society: President Obama later echoed her sentiments in a 2012 election campaign speech. Warren ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination and won it on June 2, 2012, at the state Democratic convention with a record 95.77% of the votes of delegates. She encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented that \\"no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren\\". Warren nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, more than any other Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to The New York Times, \\"that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win\\". Warren received a prime-time speaking slot at the 2012 Democratic National Convention on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that \\"has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered\\". According to Warren, \\"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged.\\" Warren said Wall Street CEOs \\"wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs\\" and that they \\"still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them\\". 2018 On January 6, 2017, in an email to supporters, Warren announced that she would be running for a second term as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, writing, \\"The people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. ... This is no time to quit.\\" In the 2018 election Warren defeated Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, 60% to 36%. =Tenure= Warren attending the swearing in of Senator Mo Cowan in the Old Senate Chamber On November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts, as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 female senators in office, the largest female U.S. Senate delegation in history at the time, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the implementation of Dodd‚ÄìFrank and other regulation of the banking industry. Vice President Joe Biden swore Warren in on January 3, 2013. At Warren's first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, \\"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'.\\" Videos of Warren's questioning amassed more than one million views in a matter of days. At a March Banking Committee hearing, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: \\"If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail ... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.\\" In May 2013, Warren sent letters to the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve questioning their decisions that settling would be more fruitful than going to court. Also in May, saying that students should get \\"the same great deal that banks get\\", Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%. Independent senator Bernie Sanders endorsed her bill, saying: \\"The only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn't\\". During the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. After the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position created for her. The appointment added to speculation that Warren would run for president in 2016. In early 2015, President Obama urged Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free trade agreement between the United States and 11 Asian and South American countries. Warren criticized the TPP, arguing that the dispute resolution mechanism in the agreement and labor protections for American workers therein were insufficient; her objections were in turn criticized by Obama. Saying \\"despite the progress we've made since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy\\", in July 2015 Warren, along with John McCain (R-AZ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Angus King (I-ME) reintroduced the 21st Century Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation was intended to reduce the American taxpayer's risk in the financial system and decrease the likelihood of future financial crises. Warren speaking at St. Patrick's Day breakfast in Boston's South Boston neighborhood, March 17, 2018 In a September 20, 2016 hearing, Warren called on Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to resign, adding that he should be \\"criminally investigated\\" over Wells Fargo's opening of two million checking and credit-card accounts without the customers' consent. In December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which The Boston Globe called \\"a high-profile perch on one of the chamber's most powerful committees\\" that would \\"fuel speculation about a possible 2020 bid for president\\". During the debate on Senator Jeff Sessions's nomination for United States attorney general in February 2017, Warren quoted a letter Coretta Scott King had written to Senator Strom Thurmond in 1986 when Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship. King wrote, \\"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.\\" Senate Republicans voted that by reading the letter from King, Warren had violated Senate Rule 19, which prohibits impugning another senator's character. This prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions's nomination, and Warren instead read King's letter while streaming live online. In rebuking Warren, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor, \\"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\\" McConnell's language became a slogan for Warren and others. On October 3, 2017, during Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy J. Sloan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Warren called on him to resign, saying, \\"At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.\\" On July 17, 2019, Warren and Rep. AI Lawson introduced legislation that would make low-income college students eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) according to the College Student Hunger Act of 2019. =Role in the 2016 presidential election= Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire, October 2016 In the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, supporters put Warren forward as a possible presidential candidate, but she repeatedly said she would not run for president in 2016. In October 2013, she joined the other 15 female Democratic senators in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person short list to be Clinton's running mate. Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine. Until her June endorsement, Warren was neutral during the Democratic primary but made public statements that she was cheering Bernie Sanders on. In June, Warren endorsed and campaigned for Clinton before Sanders endorsed Clinton. She called Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, dishonest, uncaring, and \\"a loser\\". =Committee assignments= * Committee on Armed Services ** Subcommittee on Airland ** Subcommittee on Personnel ** Subcommittee on Strategic Forces * Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs ** Subcommittee on Economic Policy ** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection (ranking member) ** Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment * Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions ** Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security * Special Committee on Aging 2020 presidential campaign Warren while formally declaring her candidacy in Lawrence, Massachusetts on February 9, 2019 At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on September 29, 2018, Warren said she would \\"take a hard look\\" at running for president in the 2020 election after the 2018 United States elections concluded. On December 31, 2018, Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee to run for president. On February 9, 2019, Warren officially announced her candidacy at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike. A longtime critic of President Trump, Warren called him a \\"symptom of a larger problem [that has resulted in] a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else\\". Warren staged her first campaign event in Lawrence to demonstrate the constituency groups she hopes to appeal to, including working class families, union members, women, and new immigrants. She called for major changes in government: Following her candidacy announcement, Warren released several policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, and plans to address opioid addiction. She has introduced an \\"Economic Patriotism\\" plan intended to create opportunities for American workers, and proposals inspired by opposition to President Trump, including one that would make it permissible to indict a sitting president. One of her signature plans was a wealth tax, dubbed the \\"Ultra-Millionaire Tax,\\" on fortunes over $50,000,000. Warren was credited with popularizing the idea of a wealth tax with Americans, leading competitor Bernie Sanders to release a wealth tax plan. Warren became known for the number and depth of her policy proposals. On her campaign website, she detailed more than 45 plans for topics including health care, universal child care, ending the opioid crisis, clean energy, climate change, foreign policy, reducing corporate influence at the Pentagon, and ending \\"Wall Street's stranglehold on the economy\\". On March 5, 2020, she ended her campaign. =Polls= In early June 2019, Warren placed second in some polls, with Joe Biden in first place and Bernie Sanders in third. In the following weeks her poll numbers steadily increased, and a September Iowa poll placed her in the lead with 22% to Biden's 20%. The Iowa poll also rated the number of voters at least considering voting for each candidate; Warren scored 71% to Biden's 60%. Poll respondents also gave her a higher \\"enthusiasm\\" rating, with 32% of her backers extremely enthusiastic to Biden's 22%. An October 24 Quinnipiac poll placed Warren in the lead at 28%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 15%. When asked which candidate had the best policy ideas, 30% of respondents named Warren, with Sanders at 20% and Biden 15%. Sanders was most often named as the candidate who \\"cares most about people like you,\\" with Warren in second place and Biden third. Sanders also placed first at 28% when respondents were asked which candidate was the most honest, followed by Warren and Biden at 15% each. =Funding= Selfie line for Elizabeth Warren after a May 19, 2019 campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire. The Los Angeles Times reported that of the front-runners in the presidential race, only Sanders and Warren have previously won an election with almost exclusively small online contributions, and that no presidential primary in recent history has had two of the top three candidates refuse to use bundlers or hold private fundraisers with wealthy donors. In January 2019, Warren said that she took no PAC money. In October 2019, Warren announced that her campaign would not accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at banks, large tech companies, private equity firms, or hedge funds, in addition to her previous refusal to accept donations of over $200 from fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives. In the third quarter of 2019 Warren's campaign raised $24.6 million, just less than the $25.3 million Sanders's campaign raised and well ahead of Joe Biden, the front-runner in the polls, who raised $15.2 million. Warren's average donation was $26; Sanders's was $18. In February 2020, Warren began accepting support from Super PACs, after failing to convince other Democratic presidential candidates to join her in disavowing them. =Public appearances= As of September 2019, Warren had attended 128 town halls. She is known for remaining afterward to talk with audience members and for the large numbers of selfies she has taken with them. On September 17, over 20,000 people attended a Warren rally at New York City's Washington Square Park. After her speech long lines formed with people waiting as long as four hours for selfies. Due to the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Warren was unable to make final campaign stops in person and opted to send her dog, Bailey Warren, to meet with voters in Iowa. =Vice-presidential speculation= In June 2020 CNN reported that Warren was among the top four vice-presidential choices for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, along with Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Representative Val Demings, and Senator Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris was officially announced as Biden's running mate on August 11, 2020. On August 13, The New York Times reported that Warren was one of Biden's four finalists along with Harris, Susan Rice, and Gretchen Whitmer. In late April, CNBC reported that big-money donors were pressuring Biden not to choose Warren, preferring other candidates purportedly on his list, such as Harris, Klobuchar and Whitmer. Political positions Warren with a supporter wearing a \\"Warren has a plan for that\\" T-shirt. The phrase became an internet meme during her presidential run. Warren is widely regarded as a progressive. In 2012, the British magazine New Statesman named Warren among the \\"top 20 U.S. progressives\\". Warren supports worker representation on corporations' board of directors, breaking up monopolies, stiffening sentences for white-collar crime, a Medicare-for-all plan to provide health insurance for all Americans, and a higher minimum wage. Warren has been highly critical of the Trump administration. She has expressed concerns over what she says are Trump's conflicts of interest. The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, written by Warren, was first read in the Senate in January 2017. In November 2018 Warren said she would not vote for Trump's United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement (USMCA): \\"It won't stop outsourcing, it won't raise wages, and it won't create jobs. It's NAFTA 2.0.\\" She has also said she believes USMCA would make it harder to reduce drug prices because it would allow drug companies to lock in the prices they charge for many drugs. Warren has been highly critical of Trump's immigration policies. In 2018 she called for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Warren has criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in support of Yemen's government against the Houthis. In January 2019, Warren criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She agreed that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Syria and Afghanistan but said such withdrawals should be part of a \\"coordinated\\" plan formed with U.S. allies. In April 2019, after reading the Mueller Report, Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying, \\"The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.\\" Public image =Ancestry and Native American relations= According to Warren and her brothers, older family members told them during their childhood that they had Native American ancestry. In 2012, she said that \\"being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born\\". In 1984, Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified herself as Cherokee. The Washington Post reported that in 1986, Warren identified her race as \\"American Indian\\" on a State Bar of Texas write-in form used for statistical information gathering, but added that there was \\"no indication it was used for professional advancement\\". A comprehensive Boston Globe investigation concluded that her reported ethnicity played no role in her rise in the academic legal profession. In February 2019, Warren apologized for having identified as Native American. During Warren's first Senate race in 2012, her opponent, Scott Brown, speculated that she had fabricated Native ancestry to gain advantage on the employment market and used Warren's ancestry in several attack ads. Warren has denied that her heritage gave her any advantages in her schooling or her career. Several colleagues and employers (including Harvard) have said her reported ethnic status played no role in her hiring. From 1995 to 2004, her employer, Harvard Law School, listed her as a Native American in its federal affirmative action forms; Warren later said she was unaware of this. A 2018 Boston Globe investigation found \\"clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools\\" and that \\"Warren was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed her\\". President Donald Trump has \\"persistently mocked\\" Warren for her assertions of Native American ancestry. At a July 2018 Montana rally, Trump promised that if he debated Warren, he would offer to pay $1 million to her favorite charity if she could prove her Native American ancestry via a DNA test. Warren released results of a DNA test in October 2018, then asked Trump to donate the money to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. Trump responded by denying that he had made the challenge. The DNA test found that Warren's ancestry is mostly European but \\"strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor\\", likely \\"in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago.\\" The Cherokee Nation criticized the use of DNA testing to determine Native American heritage as \\"inappropriate and wrong\\". According to Politico, \\"Warren's past claims of American Indian ancestry garnered fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle, with President Donald Trump labeling her with a slur, \\"Pocahontas\\", and tribal leaders calling out Warren for claiming a heritage she did not culturally belong to.\\" During a January 2019 public appearance in Sioux City, Iowa, Warren was asked by an attendee, \\"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald more fodder to be a bully?\\" Warren responded in part, \\"I am not a person of color; I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\\" She later reached out to leadership of the Cherokee Nation to apologize \\"for furthering confusion over issues of tribal sovereignty and citizenship and for any harm her announcement caused\\". Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said that Warren understands \\"that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests.\\" Warren apologized again in August 2019 before the Native American Forum in Iowa. In mid-February 2019, Warren received a standing ovation during a surprise visit to a Native American conference, where she was introduced by freshman representative Deb Haaland (D-NM), one of the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress. Haaland endorsed Warren for president in July 2019, calling her \\"a great partner for Indian Country\\". =Honors and awards= Time 100 Gala In 2009, The Boston Globe named Warren the Bostonian of the Year and the Women's Bar Association of Massachusetts honored her with the Lelia J. Robinson Award. The National Law Journal has repeatedly named Warren one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America, and in 2010 named her one of the 40 most influential attorneys of the decade. Also in 2009, Warren became the first professor in Harvard's history to win the law school's Sacks‚ÄìFreund Teaching Award for a second time. In 2011 she delivered the commencement address at Rutgers Law School, her alma mater, and received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and membership in the Order of the Coif. In 2011 Warren was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. In January 2012 New Statesman magazine named her one of the \\"top 20 U.S. progressives\\". Warren was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2017. In 2018, the Women's History Month theme in the United States was \\"Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination against Women\\", referring to McConnell's remark about Warren. =In popular culture= * Warren has appeared in the documentary films Maxed Out (2007), Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story (2009), Heist: Who Stole the American Dream? (2011), and Makers: Women Who Make America (2013). * In 2017, Kate McKinnon played Warren on Saturday Night Live. McKinnon continued her impression of Warren in 2019 and 2020, during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. On the March 7, 2020 episode, Warren appeared as herself in the cold open alongside McKinnon's impression of her, and together they opened the show. * In 2019, Warren wrote the entry on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for that year's Time 100. * Warren's popularity is the basis of a wide array of merchandise sold in her name, much of which incorporates Mitch McConnell's remark \\"Nevertheless, she persisted\\", including an action figure of Warren. * Musician Jonathan Mann has written songs about Warren, including \\"She Persisted\\". Books and other works In 2004, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation- adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt. In an article in The New York Times, Jeff Madrick said of the book: In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. The study was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged its methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses. Metropolitan Books published Warren's book A Fighting Chance in April 2014. According to a Boston Globe review, \\"the book's title refers to a time she says is now gone, when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by the rules had at a fair shot at the American dream.\\" In April 2017, Warren published her 11th book, This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class, in which she explores the plight of the American middle class and argues that the federal government needs to do more to help working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education. ;Publications ;Selected articles   * ;Books * (with Teresa A.

Some works combine live action with animation to create a live-action animated film. Live-action is used to define film, video games or similar visual media. Photorealistic animation, particularly modern computer animation, is sometimes erroneously described as ‚Äúlive-action‚Äù as in the case of some media reports about Disney's 2019 remake of The Lion King. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, live action \\"[involves] real people or animals, not models, or images that are drawn, or produced by computer\\".  Overview  As the normal process of making visual media involves live action, the term itself is usually superfluous. However, it makes an important distinction in situations in which one might normally expect animation, such as when the work is adapted from a video game, or from an animated cartoon, such as Scooby-Doo, The Flintstones, 101 Dalmatians films, or The Tick television program. The phrase \\"live action\\" also occurs within an animation context to refer to non-animated characters: in a live- action/animated film such as Space Jam, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Looney Tunes: Back in Action, or Mary Poppins in which humans and cartoons co-exist. In this case the \\"live-action\\" characters are the \\"real\\" actors, such as Michael Jordan, Bob Hoskins and Julie Andrews, as opposed to the animated \\"actors\\", such as Roger Rabbit himself. As use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in films has become a major trend, some critics, such as Mark Langer, have discussed the relationship and overlap between live action and animation. New films that use computer-generated special effects can not be compared to live action films using cartoon characters because of the perceived realism of both styles combined.  Live action vs. animation  In producing a movie, both live action and animation present their own pros and cons. Unlike animation, live action involves the photography of actors and actresses, as well as sets and props making the movie seem personal and as close to reality as possible. The only drawback being one's budget. On the other hand, animation works well in conveying abstract ideas and it generally takes much longer to produce.

It is situated at the upper and lateral part of the face and forms the prominence of the cheek, part of the lateral wall and floor of the orbit, and parts of the temporal fossa and the infratemporal fossa. It presents a malar and a temporal surface; four processes (the frontosphenoidal, orbital, maxillary, and temporal), and four borders.  Structure  = Surfaces = The malar surface is convex and perforated near its center by a small aperture, the zygomaticofacial foramen, for the passage of the zygomaticofacial nerve and vessels; below this foramen is a slight elevation, which gives origin to the zygomaticus muscle. The temporal surface, directed posteriorly and medially, is concave, presenting medially a rough, triangular area, for articulation with the maxilla (articular surface), and laterally a smooth, concave surface, the upper part of which forms the anterior boundary of the temporal fossa, the lower a part of the infratemporal fossa. Near the center of this surface is the zygomaticotemporal foramen for the transmission of the zygomaticotemporal nerve. The orbital surface forms the lateral part and some of the inferior part of the bony orbit. The zygomatic nerve passes through the zygomatic- orbital foramen on this surface. The lateral palpebral ligament attaches to a small protuberance called the orbital tubercle. = Processes = Each zygomatic bone is diamond-shaped and composed of three processes with similarly named associated bony articulations: frontal, temporal, and maxillary. Each process of the zygomatic bone forms important structures of the skull. The orbital surface of the frontal process of the zygomatic bone forms the anterior lateral orbital wall, with usually a small paired foramen, the zygomaticofacial foramen opening on its lateral surface. The temporal process of the zygomatic bone forms the zygomatic arch along with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, with a paired zygomaticotemporal foramen present on the medial deep surface of the bone. The orbital surface of the maxillary process of the zygomatic bone forms a part of the infraorbital rim and a small part of the anterior part of the lateral orbital wall. = Orbital process = The orbital process is a thick, strong plate, projecting backward and medialward from the orbital margin. Its antero-medial surface forms, by its junction with the orbital surface of the maxilla and with the great wing of the sphenoid, part of the floor and lateral wall of the orbit. On it are seen the orifices of two canals, the zygomatico-orbital foramina; one of these canals opens into the temporal fossa, the other on the malar surface of the bone; the former transmits the zygomaticotemporal, the latter the zygomaticofacial nerve. * Its postero-lateral surface, smooth and convex, forms parts of the temporal and infratemporal fossae. * Its anterior margin, smooth and rounded, is part of the circumference of the orbit. * Its superior margin, rough, and directed horizontally, articulates with the frontal bone behind the zygomatic process. * Its posterior margin is serrated for articulation, with the great wing of the sphenoid and the orbital surface of the maxilla. At the angle of junction of the sphenoidal and maxillary portions, a short, concave, non-articular part is generally seen; this forms the anterior boundary of the inferior orbital fissure: occasionally, this non- articular part is absent, the fissure then being completed by the junction of the maxilla and sphenoid, or by the interposition of a small sutural bone in the angular interval between them. = Borders = The antero-superior or orbital border is smooth, concave, and forms a considerable part of the circumference of the orbit. The antero-inferior or maxillary border is rough, and bevelled at the expense of its inner table, to articulate with the maxilla; near the orbital margin it gives origin to the quadratus labii superioris. The postero-superior or temporal border, curved like an italic letter f, is continuous above with the commencement of the temporal line, and below with the upper border of the zygomatic arch; the temporal fascia is attached to it. The postero-inferior or zygomatic border affords attachment by its rough edge to the masseter. = Articulations = The zygomatic bone articulates with the frontal bone, sphenoid bone, and paired temporal bones, and maxillary bones. = Development = The zygomatic bone is generally described as ossifying from three centers‚Äîone for the malar and two for the orbital portion; these appear about the eighth week and fuse about the fifth month of fetal life. Mall describes it as being ossified from one center which appears just beneath and to the lateral side of the orbit. After birth, the bone is sometimes divided by a horizontal suture into an upper larger, and a lower smaller division. In some quadrumana the zygomatic bone consisted of two parts, an orbital and a malar.  Society and culture  Even though the possession of this characteristic would cause the face to resemble the skull, pronounced zygomatic arches, commonly called \\"high cheekbones\\", are considered a beauty trait both in females and males. Many depictions of Qin warriors in the Terracotta Army are depicted with \\"broad foreheads, high cheekbones, large eyes, thick eyebrows, and stiff beards.\\" For this reason some individuals undergo cheek augmentation, a form of cosmetic surgery.  Other animals  The zygomatic is homologous to the jugal bone of other tetrapods. = Non- mammalian vertebrates = This jugal bone from an Edmontosaurus is over three feet (1 meter) long Diagram showing homologous bones of the skulls of a Monitor lizard and a Crocodile. Jugal bone labelled Ju, in pale green, at centre left. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the zygomatic bone is referred to as the jugal bone, since these animals have no zygomatic arch. It is found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds. It is connected to the quadratojugal and maxilla, as well as other bones, which may vary by species. This bone is considered key in the determination of general traits of the skull, as in the case of creatures, such as dinosaurs in paleontology, whose entire skull has not been found. In coelacanths and early tetrapods the bone is relatively large. Here, it is a plate-like bone forming the lower margin of the orbit and much of the side of the face. In ray-finned fishes it is reduced or absent, and the entire cheek region is generally small. The bone is also absent in living amphibians. With the exception of turtles, the jugal bone in reptiles forms a relatively narrow bar separating the orbit from the inferior temporal fenestra, of which it may also form the lower boundary. The bone is similarly reduced in birds. In mammals, it takes on broadly the form seen in humans, with the bar between the orbit and fenestra vanishing entirely, and only the lower boundary of the fenestra remaining, as the zygomatic arch.  Etymology  The term zygomatic derives from the Greek ŒñœÖŒ≥œåŒºŒ± zygoma meaning \\"yoke\\". The zygomatic bone is occasionally referred to as the zygoma, but this term may also refer to the zygomatic arch.

The latter feature distinguishes it from the slightly larger and broader-winged, but otherwise very similar, green sandpiper of Europe and Asia, to which it is closely related. The latter species has a brilliant white rump. In flight, the solitary sandpiper has a characteristic three-note whistle. They both have brown wings with little light dots, and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other scolopacids. Distribution and habitat It breeds in woodlands across Alaska and Canada. It is a migratory bird, wintering in Central and South America, especially in the Amazon River basin, and the Caribbean. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, and goes there in the summer-autumn period. =Subspecies= The solitary sandpiper is split into two subspecies: *T. s. cinnamomea, (Brewster, 1890): breeds in Alaska & western Canada *T. s. solitaria, (Wilson, 1813): breeds from eastern British Columbia to Labrador Hunting behaviour Behaviour The solitary sandpiper is not a gregarious species, usually seen alone during migration, although sometimes small numbers congregate in suitable feeding areas. The solitary sandpiper is very much a bird of fresh water, and is often found in sites, such as ditches, too restricted for other waders, which tend to like a clear all-round view. =Breeding= The sandpiper lays a clutch of 3‚Äì5 eggs in abandoned tree nests of songbird species, such as those of thrushes. The young birds are encouraged to drop to the ground soon after hatching.Federation of Alberta Naturalists. (1992) Glen P. Semenchuk (ed.). The Atlas of Breeding Birds of Alberta. Edmonton, AB:Federation of Alberta Naturalists. =Feeding= Food is small invertebrates, sometimes small frogs, picked off the mud as the bird works steadily around the edges of its chosen pond.

Wolf in 1981. It was later adapted by Disney and Amblin Entertainment into the critically acclaimed 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Plot Eddie Valiant is a hardboiled private eye, and Roger Rabbit is a second banana comic strip character. The rabbit hires Valiant to find out why his employers, the DeGreasy Brothers (Rocco and Dominic), who are owners of a cartoon syndicate, have reneged on a promise to give Roger his own strip and potentially sell his contract to a mystery buyer. Evidence shows that there was no mystery buyer and the reason Roger Rabbit remained in a secondary role was because of his lack of talent. Soon after, Roger is mysteriously murdered in his home. His speech balloon, found at the crime scene, indicates his murder was a way of \\"censoring\\" the star, who apparently had just heard someone explain the source of his success. Valiant's search for the killer takes him to a variety of suspects which includes: Roger's widow Jessica Rabbit; Roger's former co-star Baby Herman and Roger's photographer Carol Masters. Valiant then meets a doppelg√§nger of Roger's and promises to solve the mystery of his death. At the same time, Roger's former boss Rocco DeGreasy is also murdered and witnesses point out Roger as the killer, as he was allegedly seen fleeing the scene of the crime. While Valiant investigates, the key suspects ask him to be on the lookout for a certain kettle in exchange for a reward. He eventually finds the kettle which was in Roger's possession and gives it to Dominic, only to find it is actually a magic lamp with a Genie, who then kills Dominic. The Genie explains its origins and that over thousands of years it has become embittered, now only granting wishes with a catch, and admits to being the one who shot Roger. He further explains that the words to command him happen to be part of a children's song that Roger habitually sings, and as such Roger wished for success and Jessica without actually realising he had done so. When Roger accidentally activated the lantern a third time but this time witnessed the apparition, the Genie killed him. Valiant holds the Genie hostage over a salt-water fish tank; salt water being its weakness. The Genie is then forced to grant a wish made by Valiant for proof of Roger's innocence which is provided in the form of a suicide letter from Dominic confessing to both Roger and Rocco DeGreasy's murders along with his own suicide. Not trusting the Genie to keep its word of letting him go and also knowing that no one would believe him about the Genie, Valiant drops the Genie's lamp into the fish tank and the salt water dissolves the Genie. With Roger's murderer disposed of, Valiant concludes that the DeGreasy murderer was the original Roger Rabbit himself. Roger's motive was that Rocco had stolen Jessica from him, and he generated the doppelganger to be an alibi. He intended to plant the murder weapon at Valiant's office making him the fall guy but was shot by the Genie when he accidentally summoned it. The doppelganger confirms the truth and confesses that he \\"had it planned for days\\". However, for clearing his name and befriending him despite what he did and tried to do afterwards, he praises Valiant for his morals (calling him \\"a real stand-up guy\\"). Roger gives Valiant a final heartfelt goodbye before disintegrating. Edition differences The different covers used for the book give different impressions. The first is darker in tone and only shows a shadowed Roger from the back, while Valiant's face is unshaven. It focused on the two in a close- up with a black background. A later edition showed a cleanshaven Valiant while Roger's face was brightly shown. It was panned out and showed the city during day in the background. It also showed a speech bubble coming from Roger saying \\"Help! I'm stuck in a mystery of double-crossers, steamy broads, and killer cream pies.\\" Both show author Gary K. Wolf modeling as Valiant. Comparison to the film adaptation Although the book features many of the same characters used in the film, some of their characteristics, as well as the basic plot, are significantly different. The novel is set in the present day and in a strange universe in which real humans and cartoon characters co- exist. The cartoons of the novel are primarily comic strip characters, as opposed to animated cartoon stars, with famous strip characters making cameos, such as Dick Tracy, Snoopy, Dagwood and Blondie Bumstead, Beetle Bailey, and H√§gar the Horrible. Strips are produced by photographing cartoon characters. In this version, \\"toon\\" characters speak in word balloons which appear above their heads as they talk. Although some characters have learned to suppress this and speak vocally, the use of word balloons forms several important plot points. In the book, toons have the power to create duplicates of themselves as stunt doubles for risky shots. Generally they disintegrate after a few minutes or hours at the most. Roger creates one that lasts two days, although this is an exception, intending it to be as close a match to him as possible in order to be an alibi. When Roger is shot and killed by an unknown assailant, his doppelg√§nger works with the detective to solve his murder before he disintegrates. In the film, toons are more or less unkillable ‚Äî except by \\"dip\\" ‚Äî and, with a few exceptions, shrug off even the worst injuries. The only lines of dialogue from the book that were re-used in the film were spoken by Baby Herman with Baby Herman saying \\"I've got a 50-year- old lust and a 3-year-old dinky,\\" though in the book, Baby Herman's actual age is given as 36. Comparison to the spin-off In 1991, Wolf wrote another Roger Rabbit book, Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?, but (in the form of a memo from Valiant) the book says that Roger Rabbit \\"and his screwball buddies play fast and loose with historical accuracy\\", which means that the stories do not have much continuity between each other. There is no connection between this novel and the first one, with the exception of Jessica mentioning having a dream containing the events of the first novel, retconning such as just a dream. In fact, the second book attempts to connect itself more with the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit than to the first book.

Long neglected, Kalervo Palsa has enjoyed a revival of sorts since the publication of critical works, a biography and two major retrospectives in Helsinki and Pori. Life Among his local contemporaries of Kittil√§ in Lapland he had the reputation of a drunken artist masturbating at home and painting furiously. He is said to have felt haunted both by his perverse urges and the provincial and narrow-minded mental perimeter of his northern hometown. While he lived there, his abode was a tiny studio cabin which was closer to a shack than a house. He wired it for electricity by drawing a long extension cable from a nearby house. He called it his \\"Getsemane\\" after the biblical site, or sometimes his \\"castle in the clouds\\". Upon his death two rumours spread in the local community. One that he had in a drunken stupor collapsed into a snowbank, and died from exposure. The other that he had hanged himself. The latter was more understandable, since several of his self-portraits featured a hangman's noose around his neck, and several other of his paintings also used the symbology of hanging. The real circumstances of his death ‚Äì lying in bed with pneumonia, without anyone checking to see how he was doing ‚Äì were perhaps, and regrettably more fitting to an artist, but not to the figure they knew. During his life he had many artist friends such as Reidar S√§rest√∂niemi, but only two real supporters; his mother, and a soul-mate/muse he found in Maj-Lis Pitk√§nen. Maj-Lis was actually the sister of Kalervo Palsa's childhood sweetheart Maaret for whom he maintained a long-lasting unrequited torch of love, quite openly writing about it in his letters to her and her sister and eventually sisters husband. After his death Maj-Lis fought a protracted and bitter battle to raise an appropriate cenotaph for \\"Kalle\\". The monument was sculpted by the Finnish artist and Maj-Lis's husband, Pekka Pitk√§nen. The statue, shaped like a stylized seed or bullroarer was viewed by the parish as being pagan, or even representing female sexual organs. Many voices proclaimed that it was a mistake to let the \\"pervert\\" be buried into holy ground to begin with. Over time, the notables from Kittil√§, who once strenuously opposed the monument, have instead begun to express pride that an internationally renowned artist was a local boy.  The art of Kalervo Palsa Kalervo Palsa Museum Kalervo Palsa used an incredibly varied palette of techniques and materials even including housepaint. The subjects with the richest content, generally received the most hurried and crude treatment. The over 1000 self-portraits on the other hand generally were treated at the very least with competent technique. Mostly the works explore in graphic detail the dark side of humanity in general and his native northern regions specifically. Grotesque sexuality, sadism, homosexuality, bisexuality and a general emotional frigidity paraphilia reflect his own inner turmoil and were perhaps a reaction to the mental atmosphere of his hometown. Palsa did have a brief fling with abstract art while staying in New York City, but as he recounts in his diary, that phase came to an abrupt halt when one day he saw a passed out black man sprawled on a subway bench. Besides Hieronymous Bosch, his work has been compared to that of Frida Kahlo. =Influences= Kalervo Palsa gravestone Palsa drew a great deal of influence from both the lives and works of numerous painters, writers and philosophers. Painters who influenced him include Magritte and Vincent van Gogh. His works include clear references to such people as Jean-Paul Sartre, Strindberg and Jean Genet, and many more subtle influences are listed on the first page of El√§kel√§inen muistelee, where he mentions such kindred spirits as Jonathan Swift and Vladimir Lenin among many others. Despite this brand of what might be called intertextuality, some researchers have noted that though he remained active in his work up to his death in 1987, his work did not show signs of the postmodernism evident in the work of many other artists of the time. =Notable works= Artist's studio *Turva (\\"Security\\") is a painting of a giant anus surrounded by images of all the Boschian horrors that a sensitive artist could imagine. At the center of the painting the anus opens as a window showing a man blissfully seated in a rockingchair seemingly untouched by the horrors. *Missi Paskantaa (\\"A Beauty Pageant Contestant Takes a Dump\\"), a black-and-white inked comic strip. The work consists of a few pages of Pythonian deadpan illustrated technical description of the practical ramifications of even beauty pageant contestants having to defecate. It finally ends with an illustrated listing of varieties of consistency of faeces that might come out such a girls anus with attendant analysis. *El√§kel√§inen Muistelee (\\"Retiree Reminisces\\"), a black-and-white inked comic-book recounting a plethora of highly surreal homosexual sadistic tales. *Miehen Kuukautiset (\\"The Male Period\\"), painting of a man's bleeding anus. *Vapautuminen (\\"Deliverance\\"), a Munchausenian painting of a man suspended in mid-air hanged by a rope attached around the glans of his own huge penis. *Uusi Ihminen (\\"New (Hu)Man\\"), a man giving birth through his anal opening. =Palsa quotes= * \\"Lempipuuhiani niin ik√§√§n runkkaamisen ja maalaamisen lis√§ksi oli kuseminen sillalta, mieluummin virtaavaan veteen, my√∂t√§virtaan.\\" ** Translation: \\"My favorite pastimes indeed in addition to wanking off and painting was pissing down from a bridge, preferably into an effluence, downstream.\\" * \\"Ei riit√§ ett√§ maalaa kukkia, t√§ytyy maalata hirttosilmukoitakin.\\" ** Translation: \\"It won't suffice to paint flowers, one must paint hangman's nooses too.\\" * \\"Kofeiiniton kahvi, alkoholiton viina, pilluttomat naiset, mulkuttomat miehet.

With the advent of radial tyres, taking over from the older crossply type, it was found that in the event of a puncture or blowout, the tyre would be much more prone to detach from the rim, which would make a bad situation somewhat worse. The Avon Safety Wheel avoids the detachment of a deflated tyre by having a much shallower central recess within the interior of the wheel. The recess is so shallow that the tyre is prevented from twisting to an angle that would allow it to slip over the edge of the rim, so it is retained. Such a shallow recess would also prevent the fitment of new tyres, if it weren't for the inclusion of a deep channel, allowing the bead of the tyre to enter the channel to permit fitting. The channel is covered by a metal band that is tightened around the wheel after the tyre is fitted but before it is inflated. The fitting procedure is relatively troublesome and not popular with tyre fitters. This may be one reason that this design of wheel has not been widely adopted, meaning that modern cars are still prone to tyre detachment, though tyre safety itself has improved dramatically in the last 30 years. The Avon Safety Wheel was first used on the 1974 Vauxhall Firenza. The wheel design was also used on British Leyland's Morris Marina Safety Research Vehicle, though featuring very different styling from the version employed by Vauxhall. It was also used on the Bristol 411 series 4. Tires ","title":"Avon Safety Wheel"},{"id":"290228","text":"The eelpouts are the ray-finned fish family Zoarcidae.

Alluding to the seven mythological Pleiades sisters fathered by the titan Atlas, the business usage was popularized in the 1950s by businessman Enrico Mattei, then-head of the Italian state oil company Eni. The industry group consisted of: *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (originally Anglo-Persian; now BP) *Royal Dutch Shell *Standard Oil Company of California (SoCal, later Chevron) *Gulf Oil (now merged into Chevron) *Texaco (now merged into Chevron) *Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (Esso, later Exxon, now part of ExxonMobil) *Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony, later Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil) Preceding the 1973 oil crisis, the Seven Sisters controlled around 85 per cent of the world's petroleum reserves. Since then, industry dominance has shifted to the OPEC cartel and state-owned oil and gas companies in emerging-market economies, such as Saudi Aramco, Gazprom (Russia), China National Petroleum Corporation, National Iranian Oil Company, PDVSA (Venezuela), Petrobras (Brazil), and Petronas (Malaysia). In 2007, the Financial Times called these \\"the new Seven Sisters\\". According to consulting firm PFC Energy, by 2012 only 7% of the world's known oil reserves were in countries that allowed private international companies free rein. Fully 65% were in the hands of state-owned companies. Composition and history In 1951, Iran nationalized its oil industry previously controlled by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now BP), and Iranian oil was subjected to an international embargo. In an effort to bring Iranian oil production back to international markets, the U.S. State Department suggested the creation of a consortium of major oil companies, several of which were daughter corporations of John D. Rockefeller's original Standard Oil monopoly. The \\"Consortium for Iran\\" was subsequently formed by the following companies: #Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (United Kingdom) ‚Äì This company became British Petroleum. Following the takeover of Amoco (which in turn was formerly Standard Oil of Indiana) and Atlantic Richfield by British Petroleum, the name was shortened to BP in 2000. #Gulf Oil (United States) ‚Äì In 1984, most of Gulf was acquired by SoCal and the enlarged SoCal entity became Chevron. The smaller parts of Gulf Oil were acquired by BP and Cumberland Farms. A network of service stations largely in the northeastern United States still bears the Gulf name. #Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands/United Kingdom) #Standard Oil Co. of California (SoCal) (United States) ‚Äì Became Chevron in 1984 when SoCal acquired Gulf Oil. #Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey (Esso) (United States) ‚Äì Became Exxon, which renamed itself ExxonMobil following the acquisition of Mobil in 1999. #Standard Oil Co. of New York (Socony) (United States) ‚Äì Became Mobil, which was acquired by Exxon in 1999 to form ExxonMobil. #Texaco (United States) ‚Äì Acquired by Chevron in 2001. The head of the Italian state oil company (Eni), Enrico Mattei, sought membership for his company, but was rejected by what he dubbed the \\"Seven Sisters\\", the American and British companies that largely controlled the Middle East's oil production after World War II. British writer Anthony Sampson took over the term when he wrote the book The Seven Sisters in 1975, to describe the oil cartel that tried its best to eliminate competitors and keep control of the world's oil resource. The term for the oil cartel was further popularized, along with a fictional logo, in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, a 1981 film about apocalyptic fuel shortages. Being politically influential, vertically integrated, well organized, and able to negotiate cohesively as a cartel, the Seven Sisters were initially able to exert considerable power over Third World oil producers. However, in recent decades, the dominance of the Seven Sisters and their successor companies has been challenged by the following trends: * the increasing influence of the OPEC cartel (formed in 1960 and expanded steadily through 1975), * the declining share of world oil and gas reserves held by OECD countries, and * the emergence of powerful state-owned oil companies in emerging-market economies. As of 2017, the surviving companies from the Seven Sisters are BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, which form four members of the \\"supermajors\\" group.

The term \\"gymnosperm\\" comes from the composite word in ( and ), literally meaning \\"naked seeds\\". The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds contrasts with the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in yew, Torreya, Ginkgo. The gymnosperms and angiosperms together compose the spermatophytes or seed plants. The gymnosperms are divided into six phyla. Organisms that belong to the Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gnetophyta, and Pinophyta (also known as Coniferophyta) phyla are still in existence while those in the Pteridospermales and Cordaitales phyla are now extinct. By far the largest group of living gymnosperms are the conifers (pines, cypresses, and relatives), followed by cycads, gnetophytes (Gnetum, Ephedra and Welwitschia), and Ginkgo biloba (a single living species). Some genera have mycorrhiza, fungal associations with roots (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Classification An example Phylogenetic tree A formal classification of the living gymnosperms is the \\"Acrogymnospermae\\", which form a monophyletic group within the spermatophytes. The wider \\"Gymnospermae\\" group includes extinct gymnosperms and is thought to be paraphyletic. The fossil record of gymnosperms includes many distinctive taxa that do not belong to the four modern groups, including seed-bearing trees that have a somewhat fern-like vegetative morphology (the so-called \\"seed ferns\\" or pteridosperms).Hilton, Jason, and Richard M. Bateman. 2006. Pteridosperms are the backbone of seed-plant phylogeny. Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society 133: 119‚Äì168 (abstract) When fossil gymnosperms such as these and the Bennettitales, glossopterids, and Caytonia are considered, it is clear that angiosperms are nested within a larger gymnospermae clade, although which group of gymnosperms is their closest relative remains unclear. The extant gymnosperms include 12 main families and 83 genera which contain more than 1000 known species.

Nature Early characteristics of seed plants were evident in fossil progymnosperms of the late Devonian period around 383 million years ago. It has been suggested that during the mid-Mesozoic era, pollination of some extinct groups of gymnosperms was by extinct species of scorpionflies that had specialized proboscis for feeding on pollination drops. The scorpionflies likely engaged in pollination mutualisms with gymnosperms, long before the similar and independent coevolution of nectar-feeding insects on angiosperms. Evidence has also been found that mid-Mesozoic gymnosperms were pollinated by Kalligrammatid lacewings, a now-extinct family with members which (in an example of convergent evolution) resembled the modern butterflies that arose far later. Zamia integrifolia, a cycad native to Florida Conifers are by far the most abundant extant group of gymnosperms with six to eight families, with a total of 65‚Äì70 genera and 600‚Äì630 species (696 accepted names).Catalogue of Life: 2007 Annual checklist ‚Äì Conifer database Conifers are woody plants and most are evergreens.Campbell, Reece, \\"Phylum Coniferophyta.\\"Biology. 7th. 2005. Print. P.595 The leaves of many conifers are long, thin and needle-like, other species, including most Cupressaceae and some Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Agathis in Araucariaceae and Nageia in Podocarpaceae have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Cycads are the next most abundant group of gymnosperms, with two or three families, 11 genera, and approximately 338 species. A majority of cycads are native to tropical climates and are most abundantly found in regions near the equator. The other extant groups are the 95‚Äì100 species of Gnetales and one species of Ginkgo. Uses Gymnosperms have major economic uses. Pine, fir, spruce, and cedar are all examples of conifers that are used for lumber, paper production, and resin. Some other common uses for gymnosperms are soap, varnish, nail polish, food, gum, and perfumes. Life cycle Example of gymnosperm lifecycle Gymnosperms, like all vascular plants, have a sporophyte- dominant life cycle, which means they spend most of their life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Two spore types, microspores and megaspores, are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones, respectively. Gametophytes, as with all heterosporous plants, develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gamete. During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat. Genetics The first published sequenced genome for any gymnospermae was the genome of Picea abies in 2013.

Renaissance humanism was a revival in the study of classical antiquity, at first in Italy and then spreading across Western Europe in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. Contemporary use of the term humanism is consistent with the historical use prominent in that period, while Renaissance humanism is a retronym used to distinguish it from later humanist developments.The term la rinascita (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in Giorgio Vasari's Vite de' pi√π eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani (The Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568) Panofsky, Erwin. Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art, New York: Harper and Row, 1960. \\"The term umanista was used in fifteenth-century Italian academic slang to describe a teacher or student of classical literature and the arts associated with it, including that of rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in Germany in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: humanism, standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them\\" Nicholas Mann \\"The Origins of Humanism\\", Cambridge Companion to Humanism, Jill Kraye, editor [Cambridge University Press, 1996], p. 1‚Äì2). The term \\"Middle Ages\\" for the preceding period separating classical antiquity from its \\"rebirth\\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas. During the Renaissance period most humanists were religious, so their concern was to \\"purify and renew Christianity\\" not to do away with it. Their vision was to return ad fontes (\\"to the sources\\") to the simplicity of the New Testament, bypassing the complexities of medieval theology. Today, by contrast, the term humanism has come to signify \\"a worldview which denies the existence or relevance of God, or which is committed to a purely secular outlook.\\" Renaissance humanism was a response to what came to be depicted by later whig historians as the \\"narrow pedantry\\" associated with medieval scholasticism.Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to Humanist Educational Treatises, edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii. Humanists sought to create a citizenry able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging in the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis, today known as the humanities: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy. Humanism, whilst set up by a small elite who had access to books and education, was intended as a cultural mode to influence all of society. It was a program to revive the cultural legacy, literary legacy, and moral philosophy of classical antiquity. There were important centres of humanism in Florence, Naples, Rome, Venice, Genoa, Mantua, Ferrara, and Urbino. The Renaissance humanism also inspired, in those who followed it, a love of learning and \\"a true love for books....[where] humanists built book collections and university libraries developed.\\" Humanists believed that the individual encompassed \\"body, mind, and soul\\" and learning was very much a part of edifying all aspect of the human. This love of and for learning would lead to a demand in the printed word, which in turn drove the invention of Gutenberg's printing press.

Reprinted in > Renaissance Thought (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961. Origin Some of the first humanists were great collectors of antique manuscripts, including Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Coluccio Salutati, and Poggio Bracciolini. Of the four, Petrarch was dubbed the \\"Father of Humanism\\" because of his devotion or loyalty to Greek and Roman scrolls. Many worked for the Catholic Church and were in holy orders, like Petrarch, while others were lawyers and chancellors of Italian cities, and thus had access to book copying workshops, such as Petrarch's disciple Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence. In Italy, the humanist educational program won rapid acceptance and, by the mid-15th century, many of the upper classes had received humanist educations, possibly in addition to traditional scholastic ones. Some of the highest officials of the Catholic Church were humanists with the resources to amass important libraries. Such was Cardinal Basilios Bessarion, a convert to the Catholic Church from Greek Orthodoxy, who was considered for the papacy, and was one of the most learned scholars of his time. There were several 15th- century and early 16th-century humanist PopesThey include Innocent VII, Nicholas V, Pius II, Sixtus IV, Alexander VI, Julius II and Leo X. Innocent VII, patron of Leonardo Bruni, is considered the first humanist Pope. See James Hankins, Plato in the Italian Renaissance (New York: Columbia Studies in the Classical Tradition, 1990), p. 49; for the others, see their respective entries in Sir John Hale's Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance (Oxford University Press, 1981). one of whom, Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (Pope Pius II), was a prolific author and wrote a treatise on The Education of Boys.See Humanist Educational Treatises, (2001) pp. 126‚Äì259. This volume (pp. 92‚Äì125) contains an essay by Leonardo Bruni, entitled \\"The Study of Literature\\", on the education of girls. These subjects came to be known as the humanities, and the movement which they inspired is shown as humanism. The migration waves of Byzantine Greek scholars and √©migr√©s in the period following the Crusader sacking of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 greatly assisted the revival of Greek and Roman literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient languages and works.Byzantines in Renaissance ItalyGreeks in Italy They included Gemistus Pletho, George of Trebizond, Theodorus Gaza, and John Argyropoulos. Italian humanism spread northward to France, Germany, the Low Countries, Poland- Lithuania, Hungary and England with the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, and it became associated with the Reformation. In France, pre-eminent humanist Guillaume Bud√© (1467‚Äì1540) applied the philological methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on Justinian's Code. Bud√© was a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian umanisti) who was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for Fran√ßois I and helping to found the Coll√®ge des Lecteurs Royaux (later the Coll√®ge de France). Meanwhile, Marguerite de Navarre, the sister of Fran√ßois I, was a poet, novelist, and religious mysticShe was the author of Miroir de l'ame pecheresse (The Mirror of a Sinful Soul), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also \\"Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist\\" in Jonathan A.

Paganism and Christianity in the Renaissance Many humanists were churchmen, most notably Pope Pius II, Sixtus IV, and Leo X,See note two, above. and there was often patronage of humanists by senior church figures.Davies, 477 Much humanist effort went into improving the understanding and translations of Biblical and early Christian texts, both before and after the Reformation, which was greatly influenced by the work of non-Italian, Northern European figures such as Erasmus, Jacques Lef√®vre d'√âtaples, William Grocyn, and Swedish Catholic Archbishop in exile Olaus Magnus. =Description= The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy describes the rationalism of ancient writings as having tremendous impact on Renaissance scholars: In 1417, for example, Poggio Bracciolini discovered the manuscript of Lucretius, De rerum natura, which had been lost for centuries and which contained an explanation of Epicurean doctrine, though at the time this was not commented on much by Renaissance scholars, who confined themselves to remarks about Lucretius's grammar and syntax. Only in 1564 did French commentator Denys Lambin (1519‚Äì72) announce in the preface to the work that \\"he regarded Lucretius's Epicurean ideas as 'fanciful, absurd, and opposed to Christianity'.\\" Lambin's preface remained standard until the nineteenth century.See Jill Kraye's essay, \\"Philologists and Philosophers\\" in the Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism [1996], p. 153.) Epicurus's unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good \\"ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy\\".(Kraye [1996] p. 154.) Lorenzo Valla, however, puts a defense of epicureanism in the mouth of one of the interlocutors of one of his dialogues. =Epicureanism= Charles Trinkhaus regards Valla's \\"epicureanism\\" as a ploy, not seriously meant by Valla, but designed to refute Stoicism, which he regarded together with epicureanism as equally inferior to Christianity.See Trinkaus, In Our Image and Likeness Vol. 1 (University of Chicago Press, 1970), pp. 103‚Äì170 Valla's defense, or adaptation, of Epicureanism was later taken up in The Epicurean by Erasmus, the \\"Prince of humanists:\\" This passage exemplifies the way in which the humanists saw pagan classical works, such as the philosophy of Epicurus, as being in harmony with their interpretation of Christianity. =Neo-Platonism= Renaissance Neo- Platonists such as Marsilio Ficino (whose translations of Plato's works into Latin were still used into the 19th century) attempted to reconcile Platonism with Christianity, according to the suggestions of early Church Fathers Lactantius and Saint Augustine. In this spirit, Pico della Mirandola attempted to construct a syncretism of religions and philosophies with Christianity, but his work did not win favor with the church authorities, who rejected it because of his views on magic. =Widespread view= Historian Steven Kreis expresses a widespread view (derived from the 19th-century Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt), when he writes that: > The period from the fourteenth century to the seventeenth worked in favor of > the general emancipation of the individual. The city-states of northern > Italy had come into contact with the diverse customs of the East, and > gradually permitted expression in matters of taste and dress. The writings > of Dante, and particularly the doctrines of Petrarch and humanists like > Machiavelli, emphasized the virtues of intellectual freedom and individual > expression. In the essays of Montaigne the individualistic view of life > received perhaps the most persuasive and eloquent statement in the history > of literature and philosophy. Two noteworthy trends in Renaissance humanism were Renaissance Neo-Platonism and Hermeticism, which through the works of figures like Nicholas of Kues, Giordano Bruno, Cornelius Agrippa, Campanella and Pico della Mirandola sometimes came close to constituting a new religion itself. Of these two, Hermeticism has had great continuing influence in Western thought, while the former mostly dissipated as an intellectual trend, leading to movements in Western esotericism such as Theosophy and New Age thinking.Plumb, 95 The \\"Yates thesis\\" of Frances Yates holds that before falling out of favour, esoteric Renaissance thought introduced several concepts that were useful for the development of scientific method, though this remains a matter of controversy. =Sixteenth century and beyond= Though humanists continued to use their scholarship in the service of the church into the middle of the sixteenth century and beyond, the sharply confrontational religious atmosphere following the Reformation resulted in the Counter-Reformation that sought to silence challenges to Catholic theology, with similar efforts among the Protestant denominations. However, a number of humanists joined the Reformation movement and took over leadership functions, for example, Philipp Melanchthon, Ulrich Zwingli, Martin Luther, Henry VIII, John Calvin, and William Tyndale. With the Counter-Reformation initiated by the Council of Trent (1545-1563), positions hardened and a strict Catholic orthodoxy based on scholastic philosophy was imposed. Some humanists, even moderate Catholics such as Erasmus, risked being declared heretics for their perceived criticism of the church. In 1514 he left for Basel and worked at the University of Basel for several years. The historian of the Renaissance Sir John Hale cautions against too direct a linkage between Renaissance humanism and modern uses of the term humanism: \\"Renaissance humanism must be kept free from any hint of either 'humanitarianism' or 'humanism' in its modern sense of rational, non- religious approach to life ... the word 'humanism' will mislead ... if it is seen in opposition to a Christianity its students in the main wished to supplement, not contradict, through their patient excavation of the sources of ancient God-inspired wisdom.\\"Hale, 171.

They are within the South Downs National Park which is bounded by the coast, the Cuckmere and the A259 road. They are the remnants of dry valleys in the chalk South Downs, which are gradually being eroded by the sea. Cliffs From west to east, the sequence starts just east of Cuckmere Haven.

The South Downs Way runs along the edge of the cliffs, taking a very undulating course. Many landmarks around the area are named after the cliffs, including the Seven Sisters Sheep Centre. Film and television The Seven Sisters cliffs are occasionally used in filmmaking and television production as a stand-in for the more famous White Cliffs of Dover, since they are relatively free of anachronistic modern development and are also allowed to erode naturally. As a result, the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head remain a bright white colour, whereas the White Cliffs of Dover are protected due to the important port and are therefore increasingly covered in vegetation and are greening as a result. They are also featured at the beginning of the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and at the end of the film Atonement where Robbie and Cecilia always wanted to live. Much of the 2015 feature film Mr. Holmes was filmed around the Seven Sisters. The 2019 film Hope Gap, starring Bill Nighy and Annette Bening was against the backdrop of Seaford Head. The film is named after the distinctive area of chalk cliff between Seaford and Cuckmere Haven. In 2020, Jessica Swale's feature film debut Summerland will premiere, set in and shot around the Seaford area, featuring numerous views of the Seven Sisters.

Adults and juveniles may shoal together, and they may be found singly or in pairs. The bonefish feeds on benthic worms, fry, crustaceans, and mollusks. Ledges, drop-offs, and clean, healthy seagrass beds yield abundant small prey such as crabs and shrimp. It may follow stingrays to catch the small animals they root from the substrate.  Fishing and cuisine  Fly fishing for bonefish, called bonefishing, is a popular sport in the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and southern Florida. Since bonefish live in shallow inshore water, fishing may be done by wading or from a shallow-draft boat. Bonefishing is mostly done for the sport, so the fish are released, but they may also be eaten.

When drug lord Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, his organization split into two opposing factions: the Tijuana Cartel whose leadership was inherited by his nephews and heirs, the Arellano F√©lix brothers; and the Sinaloa Cartel whose leadership fell to former lieutenants H√©ctor Luis Palma Salazar, Adri√°n G√≥mez Gonz√°lez, Ismael Zambada Garc√≠a, Ignacio Coronel Villarreal, and Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera (El Chapo).

Taking advantage of the pressure being placed on the Tijuana Cartel, other drug bosses, most notably Ismael Zambada and Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n, began to encroach on strongholds in northwestern Mexico, leading to full-scale war. Zambada has historically worked closely with the Ju√°rez Cartel and the Carrillo Fuentes family, while maintaining independent ties to Colombian cocaine suppliers. Zambada has been wanted by Mexico's attorney general's office since 1998, when it issued bounties totaling $2.8 million USD on him and five other leaders of the Ju√°rez Cartel. Zambada headed the Sinaloa Cartel in partnership with Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, until 2016 when El Chapo was captured. Zambada has now possibly assumed full command of the Sinaloa Cartel. Zambada is likely Mexico's most enduring and powerful drug lord. He may have had plastic surgery and disguised himself to move throughout Mexico.\\"Did feds cut deal with Mexican kingpin's son?\\". Michael Tarm. NBC News. 9 August 2011. Retrieved 2 April 2013.  Drug trafficking  Zambada Garc√≠a's organization, the Sinaloa Cartel, receives multi-ton quantities of cocaine, mostly by sea from Colombian sources. After receipt of the cocaine, the Sinaloa cartel uses a variety of methods, including airplanes, trucks, cars, boats, and tunnels to transport the cocaine to the United States. Members of the cartel smuggle the cocaine to distribution cells in Arizona, California, Illinois, and New York. Zambada operates primarily in the States of Sinaloa and Durango, but exerts influence along a large portion of Mexico's Pacific coast, as well as in Cancun, Quintana Roo, Sonora, Monterrey and Nuevo Leon. Ismael Zambada has been featured on America's Most Wanted,America's Most Wanted and the FBI is offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his capture. On 20 October 2008, some of his relatives were arrested in Mexico City on drug trafficking charges: Ismael's brother, Jesus \\"The King\\" Zambada, along with Ismael's son and nephew. His son, Ismael \\"Mayito\\" Zambada Jr. has been sought for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance in the United States. His other son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, was arrested by the Mexican Army on 18 March 2009. On 24 June 2020, it was revealed that Zambada had been willing to give former top Mexican drug lords Rafael and Miguel Caro Quintero high ranking positions in the Sinaloa Cartel if they agreed to join. However, the effort to recruit the Caro Quintero brothers faltered as Zambada's health declined and El Chapo's sons, who were less willing to grant them leadership, gained more influence.

With guidance and encouragement signing develops from a natural stage in infants development known as gesture. These gestures are taught in conjunction with speech to hearing children, and are not the same as a sign language. Some common benefits that have been found through the use of baby sign programs include an increased parent-child bond and communication, decreased frustration, and improved self-esteem for both the parent and child. Researchers have found that baby sign neither benefits nor harms the language development of infants. Promotional products and ease of information access have increased the attention that baby sign receives, making it pertinent that caregivers become educated before making the decision to use baby sign.  Overview  Baby sign involves enhanced gestures and altered signs that infants are taught in conjunction with spoken words with the intention of creating richer parent-child communication. The main reason that parents use baby sign is with hope that it will reduce the frustration involved in trying to interpret their pre-verbal child's needs. It can be considered a useful method of communication in the early developmental stages, since speech production follows children's ability to express themselves through bodily movement. Baby sign is distinct from sign language. Baby sign is used by hearing parents with hearing children to improve communication. Sign languages, including ASL, BSL, ISL and others, are natural languages, typically used in the Deaf community. Sign languages maintain their own grammar, and sentence structure. Because sign languages are as complex to learn as any spoken language, simplified signs are often used with infants in baby sign. Teaching baby signs allows for greater flexibility in the form of sign and does not require the parent to learn the grammar of a sign language. Baby signs are usually gestures or signs taken from the sign language community and modified to make them easier for an infant to form. It is common for the difference between symbolic gestures and baby signs to be mistaken. Symbolic gestures are a form of communication that children adopt before they develop the ability to produce spoken language. This includes pointing to what they want or using a hand motion in conjunction with a word which allows greater communication for infants. Infants from about six months of age can begin to learn the basic signs, which cover such objects and concepts as ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù, ‚Äúmilk‚Äù, ‚Äúwater‚Äù, ‚Äúhungry‚Äù, ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù, ‚Äúpacifier‚Äù, ‚Äúmore‚Äù, ‚Äúhot‚Äù, ‚Äúcold‚Äù, ‚Äúplay‚Äù, ‚Äúbath‚Äù, and ‚Äúteddy bear‚Äù. Typically, developing children will produce their first gestures between the ages of 9 and 12 months without any prompting or assistance from a caregiver. Infants learn how to use their body language, eye gaze, and hand gestures as a way to attract attention and communicate. Once children gain some language production, they will couple language with gesture to further communicate. Gesture remains present in all individuals at any age which is a distinguishing factor from baby sign. Pros and cons =Suggested benefits= Baby sign promotes communication before a child is able to verbally communicate with others. Since gestures are part of normal speech, teaching baby sign allows infants to learn an aspect of communication that is used with language. It is not, however designed to replace language. This demonstrates that infants are able to learn gestures before mastering verbal skills. Therefore, those who learn these simplified signs may enhance their cognitive development by gaining language skills through both visual and auditory modes. In an article in The Psychologist, Gwyneth Doherty-Sneddon has considered in detail the theory behind the growth of this phenomenon and some of the claims made by its supporters. Doherty- Sneddon points out that baby sign is not entirely new. Variations have been used by speech and language therapists for decades with children who have impairments to either their speech, cognitive abilities, or both. It is widely recognized that communication is at the heart of cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral development in children. Baby sign may assist in improving these significant developmental functions. Baby signs create mutual attention between the parent and child leading to further elaboration of what the infant is communicating. A study collected self reports from mothers, who engaged in a baby sign training workshop, to clarify whether or not signing with their child would create added parental stress and/or enhance parent-child communication. Overall the parents did not express feeling heightened stress or frustration from the baby sign training process but rather they reported a greater ability to understand their child. This richer communication was found to lead to a more positive interaction with their child which overall benefits the establishment of an earlier parent-child bond. Children who learned enhanced symbolic gestures performed better on both expressive and receptive verbal language tests compared to those who had not been encouraged to learn such gestures. Receptive language means being able to recognize words and signs, while expressive language involves the process of forming words or signs. Research has shown that enhanced gesture input for hearing children is the first step toward successfully mastering gesture use, and the use of representational form and symbolic communicative function. Improved symbolic gestures may contribute to language development by providing children with increased knowledge of concepts by explaining the functions of the objects that they are exposed to. In support of expressive language development studies have shown that learning symbolic gestures can lead to advanced verbal development and accelerated language acquisition. An effective baby sign workshop also resulted in the improvement of numerous areas of development by comparing the child's results before and after the workshop. Some of these areas included communicative, cognitive, social, adaptive behavior, physical, and fine motor skill development of children. This enhancement however, is short-lived (from between 12 and 15 months of age). Doherty-Sneddon argues, however, that this timescale represents only a general norm. The enhancement and advantage is far more extended in the many toddlers who do not speak until well after their second birthdays. Doherty-Sneddon also states a key issue is ensuring that sufficient and appropriately designed research is available to back the claims made in relation to baby signing. A literature review concluded that although benefits were reported in 13 of 17 studies, various weaknesses in the methods used for baby sign studies leave the evidence unsupported. Certainly, research into the effects of baby signing needs better control groups, such as children who are involved in equally interesting and fun activities based around adult and child language interaction, but not baby signing. This suggestion for further research implies that it may not be the baby signs themselves that facilitate language development but rather the underlying benefit being active, joint attention that is stimulated by baby sign. Therefore, the enhanced joint visual attention during parent-child interaction empowers the infant to focus the topic and context of the conversation, clarify concepts, and creates added practice with symbolic interaction. These underlying mechanisms of baby sign are proposed to create benefits for the infant such as; enhancing vocabulary, advancing cognitive development, reducing tantrums and frustration, and improving the parent-child relationship and communication. More specifically language development is improved by advancing comprehension, promoting literacy and successfully allowing the infant to express their needs so the parent becomes more responsive and observant of their baby. = Why it may be neither beneficial nor harmful = Researchers have suggested the possibility of parents and experimenters being overly liberal in attributing sign or word status to early attempts at communication by children. Puccini and Liszkowski found that when infants associate labels with objects, they use verbal cues more frequently than gestures to make these associations. The process of further facilitating gesturing with baby signs is suggested to possibly cause interference toward children's mapping of these words. This may be a result of infants lacking enough attention to take in these two types of information and process it at the same time. It is suggested that these labels, and further through the facilitation of baby sign, that it is unlikely that baby sign is facilitating speech development in infants. Baby sign programs encourage parents to improve their communication skills between themselves and their infants before they have developed speech. Kirk and colleagues have found that the results of their study with hearing infants provided no evidence to support that a child‚Äôs language development would benefit from learning baby sign. They also found that children who participated in baby sign had similar language development to children who did not learn baby sign. It is suggested that participating in baby sign may be an unnecessary effort with infants when being motivated by the hopes of advanced language learning for the child. However, it was found that mothers who used baby sign with their infants encouraged increased independence with them and supported a higher level of independence for their child. Another conducted research study has shown that there are no significant differences found with language acquisition between infants who are receiving or not receiving exposure to baby sign, including reaching language milestones Although no support for using baby sign was found in this study, there was also no negative effects found to be associated with language development when using baby sign with your child. It is possible that baby sign is working in support of infant's spoken language, but was not found to further their later language development. The results of multiple studies regarding baby sign have found that the advantages provided do not go beyond children over the age of two years old. The results of this literature review have not shown support that baby sign increases a child's linguistic development. When teaching a child baby sign, an infant's attention is directed away from what they are interested in and is redirected towards the adult and the desired sign. This interaction has been claimed to increase joint attention between parent and child, but has yet to be studied enough in research literature. It has also been proposed by researchers that baby sign may increase parental stress rather than decrease it because of busy lifestyles that may be disrupting interactions between parents and children. Teaching baby sign outside of research settings does not allow for the parent to raise questions or concerns to trained individuals. Reaching fundamental linguistic milestones and the natural course of children's language development has been suggested to be disrupted because of the unnatural intervention in language development that baby sign provides, supported by the lack of support in prior studies which have been analyzed. Learning baby sign There are numerous concepts to keep in mind when encouraging baby sign. Caregivers should ensure that they have their infant's attention, maintain consistency with what sign is used and how it is used in relation to an item, repeat signs often, encourage the infant, and be alert to recognize when the infant is signing back. When it comes to infants who have not yet acquired language abilities, signs are an easy and readily accessible form of communication. Prior to infants learning specific signs or developing language skills, they acquire the spontaneous use of gesture. An infant‚Äôs first gesture may appear between 9‚Äì12 months of age, often classified as pointing. Gesturing gradually increases as infants connect pointing to word meaning, making a gesture-plus-word combination that will evolve into a two word combination. It is thought that gestures may be easier for infants to remember than a name alone since a gesture is representative of what the child can picture happening, when thinking about the item. To determine how infant communication is influenced by gesture and speech, Iverson and Goldin-Meadow conducted a study. Infants in the study used eye gaze, body position, and vocalization to attract and direct their target audience's attention, while gesturing to items. Results looked to see if the gestures that children use are related to the word they say while doing the gesture. Iverson and Goldin-Meadow found that infants gesture for items that they did not have the ability to express with words. When words were produced by the child, they typically were ones that the child had already been gesturing for. This shows that gesture is directly linked to the words that children will produce. Symbolic gesture is the specific term that encompasses baby sign. This form of gesture aids in communication through the use of hand movements that represent an item or feeling. Infants are quick to note if there is a connection between an item and a symbolic gesture. Once they make the connection infants will imitate actions that are produced by the caregiver. Consistency from the caregiver is crucial during the teaching and feedback stage in order for infants to learn from repetition. This repetition applies to how the caregiver uses the sign and in what way the sign is associated with the object or emotion. If the association changes then the child will have a harder time understanding how the symbolic gesture links to the item. One way for caregivers to ensure the infant associates the symbolic gesture with the object or emotion is to gain the infant's attention, and say the name of the object at the same time that the sign is performed. Infants watch their caregiver during everyday routines and situations. This observation allows infants to learn symbols by borrowing the actions from the observed routine. A natural association occurs between signs and items, allowing infants to explore and express new ideas prior to language development. Infants will learn to associate a word with the general motion that they carry out while using an object, such as throwing a ball. After this association children begin to make connections with the word and motion alone, in this case a throwing gesture. Infants now can make the throwing gesture to alert caregivers that they wish to throw a ball, thus increasing their non-verbal communication. Representative abilities such as these are further used by infants to demonstrate emotional feelings as they associate a motion or sign with a feeling. Further studies demonstrate that increasing the use of gesture, not necessarily use of a sign language, can increase the richness of a child's linguistic development. It is suggested that learning signs happens over a period of time, inferring the importance of caregivers being patient with children as it takes more than a brief interaction between parent and child. Parent-child interactions are vital to the learning of baby sign since the infant looks to the caregiver for guidance. By consciously demonstrating the sign to the infant, the caregiver and infant are sustaining joint attention which increases communication. When caregivers aid infants in creating the sign with their hands, they are further increasing encouragement, repetition, and communication. It is the caregiver‚Äôs job to not only teach specific hand signals, beyond what infants naturally pick up, but to provide support and feedback to infants when signs are produced correctly. Through making a connection, and parental encouragement of that connection, infants can learn and actively engage in baby sign language. In 1998, a program was conducted at A. Sophie Rogers Infant-Toddler Laboratory School in Ohio State University by Kimberlee Whaley. Infants as young as 9 months old and their teachers began to learn to use some signs from American Sign Language to communicate with each other effectively. The program found that children would use the signs they learned in the classroom at home. Based on this study, learning baby sign appears to be a beneficial tool for children if implemented in schools and day cares. Media and Internet influences Due to promotional products, easy access to baby sign tutorial videos, and representations in popular culture, parental attempts at signing with their baby may be more focused on the popularity social aspects instead of an intention to potentially enhance their child's communication skills. A study examined the degree to which information about baby sign found on the internet was based on research. Results found thirty-three websites that all promoted baby sign and the benefits associated. Over 90% of the information referred to opinion articles or promotional products encouraging parents to sign, with little to no basis in research. Although websites claim that using baby sign will reduce tantrums, increase infant‚Äôs self-esteem, satisfaction, feelings of accomplishment, increase parent-child bonding, and decrease frustration, the sites do not provide enough research-based evidence to support these claims. Another study examined internet information found using Google Scholar as well as a few academic databases. Researchers examined whether results claimed baby sign encouraged developmental, social, cognitive, and language skills while achieving a greater bond between parent and child. The goal of asking this question was to find information that allows parents, caregivers, childhood educators, and clinicians to make informed decisions about the amount of emphasis to place on baby sign. When all the cited material was gathered there were 1747 articles with only 10 articles providing research regarding infant's developmental outcome in connection to baby sign. Consensus gathered from these 10 articles states that baby sign, as used by the commercially advertised product authored by Acredolo and Goodwyn, does not benefit language production or parent-child relationships. However, there is also no evidence from these articles that baby sign is in any way harmful to infants. Through these two studies it is illustrated that websites may not contain 100% research based information. Individuals looking for information regarding the pros and cons of using baby sign should ensure they are accessing sites backed by research and not opinion. Commercial products available to parents participating in baby sign workshops or implementing it at home, are found to be comparable to the quality of products used in research studies. It is suggested that parents be cautious of baby sign products as it is difficult to tell the credibility of commercialized products for facilitating baby sign with your child.

He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1988, and the Padma Bhushan in 2002, by the Government of India presented by President Abdul Kalam. He was also awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1990, given by the Sangeet Natak Academy, India's National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama. In 1999, he was awarded the United States National Endowment for the Arts' National Heritage Fellowship, the highest award given to traditional artists & musicians. Early life and education Zakir Hussain was born on March 9, 1951 in a nursing home in Mahim (a suburb of Mumbai) at about 11:00 a.m Hussain was born to tabla maestro Alla Rakha. His mother's name was Bavi Begum. It was said that Hussain was an 'unlucky' child since his father was extremely ill around the time of his birth. Although their family name is Qureshi, Zakir was given the surname Hussain. He attended St. Michael's High School in Mahim, and briefly attended St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. Hussain was a child prodigy. His father taught him Pakhawaj from the age of 3 years. His father would wake him up at 3 a.m. and would teach him vocally by reciting different rhythms till 6 a.m. Zakir's father Alla Rakha belonged to the Punjab gharana tradition of tabla-playing. Others gharanas being Delhi, Benares, Ajrara, Farrukhabad, and Lucknow.https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/perfect-fourths/237527 He gave his first concert at the age of seven and was deemed a child prodigy. He was touring by the age of eleven. He went to the United States in 1970 to accompany sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. After the tour was complete, Ravi Shankar advised Zakir to stay in America and take a teaching job at the University of Washington in the Department of Ethnomusicology. He planned to study for a PhD but midway he moved to the Bay Area to accompany Ali Akbar Khan who was in need of a tabla player. After that he began his international career, including more than 150 concert dates a year. Career  Ustad Zakir Hussain performing at leftFrom a young age, Zakir has been accompanying all the leading lights of Hindustani classical music, both vocal and instrumental - from Pandit Ravi Shankar, Ustad Vilayat Khan, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma, Pandit VG Jog, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Pandit Jasraj, and many more. Both Zakir and his father Alla Rakha were responsible popularizing the art of tabla playing at international venues. Their performances raised the visibility of tabla players who previously did not receive as much notoriety. Zakir brought great attention to and raised the profile of tabla players through his solo acts along with his excursions as an accompanist. One of the unique contributions of Zakir is his use of the \\"bayan\\" to create melody. He uses this throughout his playing but especially so during the \\"sawaal-jawaab\\" section of a recital, where the instrumentalist playing the sitar, sarod, santoor, etc. and the tabla player typically have a \\"question-answer\\" back and forth. This would typically involve a set of notes played together, which the tabla player reproduces. Zakir's popularity was responsible for bringing audiences to a Hindustani music concert which came not just to listen to the main melody artist but to the supporting tabla artist. Zakir inspired a whole generation of young tabla players who grew up imitating his head gestures and even his hair style while performing. Zakir's fame spread internationally following many tour performances in the US and Europe. He also collaborated with many musicians from all over India and the world. He collaborated with violinist L. Shankar, guitarist John McLaughlin, mridangam player Ramnad Raghavan, and legendary ghatam player Vikku Vinayakram in forming the fusion group Shakti, which performed worldwide to great acclaim. Twenty years later, a second version of the Shakti group, called Remember Shakti, was created featuring U. Srinivas, Zakir Hussain, TV Selvaganesh, and Shankar Mahadevan. Hussain played on George Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World and John Handy's 1973 album Hard Work. He also performed on Van Morrison's 1979 album Into the Music and Earth, Wind & Fire's 1983 album Powerlight. Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, who had known Zakir since the 1960s, invited him to create the special album Planet Drum, featuring legendary drummers from different parts of the world. Featured along with Zakir, from India, was Vikku Vinayakram, with whom Zakir had collaborated in Shakti. The first Planet Drum album, released in 1991 on the Rykodisc label, went on to earn the 1992 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album, the first Grammy ever awarded in this category. The Global Drum Project album and tour brought Mickey Hart, Zakir Hussain, Sikiru Adepoju, and Giovanni Hidalgo together again in a reunion sparked by the 15th anniversary of the ground- breaking album Planet Drum. The album Global Drum Project won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album at the 51st Grammy Awards Ceremony held on 8 February 2009.) Zakir composed, performed and acted as Indian music advisor for the Malayalam film Vanaprastham, a 1999 Cannes Film Festival entry which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival (AFI Fest) in 1999, and won awards at 2000 Istanbul International Film Festival (Turkey), 2000 Mumbai International Film Festival (India), and 2000 National Film Awards (India). He has composed soundtracks for several movies, most notably In Custody and The Mystic Masseur by Ismail Merchant, and has played tabla on the soundtracks of Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Bernardo Bertolucci's Little Buddha, and other films. He starred in several films specifically showcasing his musical performance both solo and with different bands, including the 1998 documentary \\"Zakir and His Friends\\", and the documentary \\"The Speaking Hand: Zakir Hussain and the Art of the Indian Drum\\" (2003 Sumantra Ghosal). Hussain co-starred as Inder Lal in the Merchant Ivory Film Heat and Dust in 1983, for which he was an associate music director.) Hussain is a founding member of Bill Laswell's 'World Music Supergroup' Tabla Beat Science. In 2016, Zakir Hussain was amongst many musicians invited by President Obama to the International Jazz Day 2016 All-Star Global Concert at the White House. Haridas Vhatkar has been making Zakir's tabla's for the past 18+ years. Haridas said he learned how to make tabla so he could specially make them for Zakir. Zakir has stated that he doesn't play at private gatherings, corporate events, or weddings; he believes music should not be heard at events where folks come to socialize, drink or enjoy a meal (music should be the sole purpose of the event).  Book  Nasreen Munni Kabir compiled 15 interview sessions (each lasting about 2 hours) from 2016-2017 into the book Zakir Hussain: A Life in Music, which was published in 2018. This book takes the reader through Zakir's life from his childhood, his years of intense training, and growth to fame as a renowned musician. Personal life Zakir Hussain married Antonia Minnecola, a Kathak dancer and teacher, who is also his manager. They have two daughters, Anisa Qureshi and Isabella Qureshi. Anisa graduated from UCLA and is trying her hand in video production and film making. Isabella is studying dance in Manhattan. Zakir Hussain has two brothers: Ustad Taufiq Qureshi, a percussionist and Ustad Fazal Qureshi, also a tabla player. Their brother Munawar died at a young age when he was attacked by a rabid dog. His eldest sister Bilquis died before Zakir was born. His sister Razia died due to complications during a cataract surgery. He has another sister Khurshid. He was named an Old Dominion Fellow by the Humanities Council at Princeton University, where he resided for the 2005‚Äì2006 semester as full professor in the music department. He was also a visiting professor at Stanford University. He now resides in San Francisco.

Cuti√© left the Roman Catholic Church in May 2009, after publication of photographs showing him with a woman at the beach and his subsequent admission that he was in love.

As a teenager he worked as a DJ. He was ordained as a Catholic priest of the Archdiocese of Miami in 1995, the first ordinand of the then-newly designated Archbishop John Clement Favalora (retired 20 April 2010). As \\"Father Albert\\", he was the first priest to host a secular talk show both on radio and television. He is also a regular columnist whose writings appear in many Spanish language newspapers throughout the United States and Latin America. He gained worldwide recognition with his television debut in 1999 as the host of Padre Alberto (and later Cambia tu Vida con el Padre Alberto), a daily talk show televised on the Telemundo network. He later served as host of the weekly program America en Vivo on Telemundo International. Beginning in 2002, Cuti√© hosted a weekly talk program called Hablando Claro con el Padre Alberto, reaching millions of households throughout the United States, Canada, Spain and Latin America on EWTN Espa√±ol, which is part of the global network founded by Mother Angelica. In July 2003 he officiated at Celia Cruz's Funeral Mass in Miami, Florida. Cuti√© also published his first self-help book, Real Life, Real Love (Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad) in January 2006. It sold thousands of copies and became a bestseller in the Spanish language market. His second book, Dilemma: A Priest's Struggle with Faith and Love (Dilema: La Lucha de un Sacerdote Entre Su Fe y el Amor), was released on January 4, 2011. He has been labelled as \\"Father Oprah\\" by various publications. He served as President and General Director of Radio Paz and Radio Peace Catholic 24-hour radio station beginning in January 2001. He hosted several radio programs, such as Al Dia and Linea Directa, and directed the daily operations of Pax Catholic Communications for the Archdiocese of Miami until 2009. On April 2, 2009, he was named one of AARP's new Hispanic Ambassadors. On January 4, 2011, Cuti√© released a memoir, Dilemma. To promote the book, he appeared on Good Morning America, The View, Fox and Friends, and The Joy Behar Show as well as several national Spanish language television programs, including Don Francisco Presenta, Despierta America, and Al Rojo Vivo. Personal life On May 5, 2009, Cuti√© asked church officials for a time of reflection and a leave of absence from his media programs and pastoral work after publication of pictures in which he was shown kissing and touching Ruhama Buni Canellis at a public beach while still a Catholic priest. Cuti√© asked the Archdiocese of Miami for some time to think and make a decision on where his life as a priest was heading. As a result, the Archdiocese of Miami granted him a leave of absence for an undefined period of personal decision making. After meeting with two of his bishops and informing them of his decision, he chose to continue his ministry as a married priest in the Episcopal Church, part of the Anglican Communion. On May 11, 2009, Cuti√© was interviewed by Maggie Rodriguez of CBS' The Early Show. He said that he was thinking about leaving the Roman Catholic Church for a woman he loves. He said that he respected the existing rule of mandatory celibacy and acknowledged that some priests remain dedicated to that calling. There are many priests in communion with the Vatican who are married, but they are not members of the Latin Rite. He stated he did not want to become the \\"anti-celibacy priest\\". On May 13, 2009, Cuti√© was interviewed by Teresa Rodr√≠guez on the Univision show Aqui y Ahora. He said: \\"I do regret if my actions hurt people with all my heart\\", adding \\"[t]here are other ways to serve God. I am not the same man I was when I entered the seminary 22 years ago.\\" By the end of the month Cuti√© announced that he had been in the process of discerning entering the Episcopal Church for the last couple of years, which in turn helped him consolidate marriage and his calling to serve God.

The major companies of the group include Mitsui & Co. (general trading company), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Sapporo Breweries, Toray Industries, Mitsui Chemicals, Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Mitsui Fudosan. History =Edo period origins= Surugacho (Suruga Street) (1856), from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo, by Hiroshige, depicting the Echigoya kimono and money exchange store with Mount Fuji in background. Currently, the Mitsui Main Building (‰∏â‰∫ïÊú¨È§®), which houses Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mitsui Fudosan, The Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. and Mitsui Memorial Museum, is located on the right side of the street. Mitsukoshi department store is on the left side. Founded by Mitsui Takatoshi (1622-1694), who was the fourth son of a shopkeeper in Matsusaka, in what is now today's Mie prefecture. From his shop, called Echigoya (Ë∂äÂæåÂ±ã), Mitsui Takatoshi's father originally sold miso and ran a pawn shop business. Later, the family would open a second shop in Edo (now called Tokyo). Takatoshi moved to Edo when he was 14 years old, and later his older brother joined him. Sent back to Matsutaka by his brother, Takatoshi waited for 24 years until his older brother died before he could take over the family shop, Echigoya. He opened a new branch in 1673;Hall, John. (1970). Japan: From Prehistory to Modern Times, p. 290. a large gofukuya (kimono shop) in Nihonbashi, a district in the heart of Edo. This genesis of Mitsui's business history began in the Enp≈ç era, which was a neng≈ç meaning \\"Prolonged Wealth\\". In time, the gofukuya division separated from Mitsui, and is now called Mitsukoshi. Traditionally, gofukuyas provided products made to order; a visit was made to the customer's house (typically a person of high social class or who was successful in business), an order taken, then fulfilled. The system of accountancy was called \\"margin transaction\\". Mitsui changed this by producing products first, then selling them directly at his shop for cash. At the time, this was an unfamiliar mode of operation in Japan. Even as the shop began providing dry goods to the government of the city of Edo, cash sales were not yet a widespread business practice. At about this time, Edo's government had struck a business deal with Osaka. Osaka would sell crops and other material to pay its land tax. The money was then sent to Edo--but moving money was dangerous in middle feudal Japan. In 1683 the shogunate granted permission for money exchanges (ry≈çgaeten) to be established in Edo.Shinj≈ç, Hiroshi. (1962). History of the Yen: 100 Years of Japanese Money-economy, p. 11. The Mitsui \\"exchange shops\\" facilitated transfers and mitigated that known risk. =Formation of Mitsui zaibatsu= After the Meiji Restoration, Mitsui was among the enterprises that were able to expand to become zaibatsu not simply because they were already big and rich at the start of modern industrial development. Firms like Mitsui and Sumitomo were led by non-family managers such as Minomura Rizaemon, who guided the business by accurately forecasting the coming political and economic situations, by acquaintance with high- ranking government officials or politicians, and bold investment. Mitsui's main business in the early period was drapery, finance, and trade, the first two being the businesses it inherited from the Tokugawa Era. It entered into mining because it acquired a mine as collateral from the loan it had made, and partly because it could buy a mine cheaply from the government, Mitsui then diversified to become the biggest business in pre-war Japan. The diversification was made mainly into related fields to take advantage of accumulated capabilities; for instance, the trading company entered into chemicals to attain forward integration. Takashi Masuda On July 1, 1876, Mitsui Bank, Japan's first private bank, was founded with Takashi Masuda (1848‚Äì1938) as its president. Mitsui Bank, which following a merger with Taiy≈ç-Kobe Bank in the mid-1980s became part of Sakura Bank, survives as part of the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. During the early 20th century, Mitsui was one of the largest zaibatsu, operating in numerous fields. Mitsui Bank became the holding company of the Mitsui zaibatsu from 1876. It was joined as an ultimate parent company by Mitsui & Co. and Mitsui Mining in 1900, with various industrial concerns owned by various combinations of these companies and their subsidiaries. Likewise, Mitsui invested in maritime transportation to support its trading activities as well as invest in passenger transportation, first with the creation in 1878 of Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK), which was merged with Mitsui Steamship in 1964, to become Mitsui OSK Lines ('MOL'), which is today one of the largest ocean shipping groups in the world. When the United Kingdom withdrew from the gold standard in 1931, during the height of the Great Depression, Mitsui Bank and Mitsui & Co. were found to have speculated around the transaction. This raised a political furor in Japan and resulted in the assassination of Mitsui executive Takuma Dan. =World War II= As part of the Japanese plans for the exploitation of China, during the 1930s and '40s, the subsidiary tobacco industry of Mitsui had started production of special \\"Golden Bat\\" cigarettes using the then- popular in the Far East trademark. Their circulation was prohibited in Japan and was used only for export. Local Japanese secret service kempetai under the controversial Imperial Japanese Army General Kenji Doihara had the control of their distribution in China and Manchuria where the production exported. Within the mouthpiece were small discreet doses of opium or heroin, and consequently millions of unsuspecting consumers became addicted to these narcotics, while huge profits were created for the company. The mastermind of the plan, Doihara, was later prosecuted and convicted for war crimes before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, sentenced to death; but no actions ever took place against the company which profited from their production. According to testimony presented at the Tokyo War Crimes trials in 1948, the revenue from the narcotization policy in China, including Manchukuo, was estimated in 20 million to 30 million yen per year, while another authority stated that the annual revenue was estimated by the Japanese military at US$300 million a year.Mitsui: Three Centuries of Japanese Business, pages 312-313, John G. Roberts, Weatherhill, . 1991Encyclopedia of espionage, p.315, Ronald Sydney Seth, , Doubleday, 1974 During the Second World War, Mitsui employed American prisoners of war as slave laborers, some of whom were maimed by Mitsui employees.Unfinished Business, Foreign Policy, June 28, 2010 =Postwar development as keiretsu= In 1947 and 1948, the Supreme Commander Allied Powers pressed the Japanese government to dismantle the ten largest zaibatsu conglomerates, including Mitsui. The Mitsui Group, now broken into many separate companies, reorganized itself as a horizontal coalition of independent companies in the 1950s, once the occupation of Japan had ended and some of the smaller companies were allowed to re-coalesce. The central firms in the keiretsu became Mitsui Bank and Mitsui & Co.. Mitsui lagged somewhat behind its rivals Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Group in reorganization. Mitsui Bank, which should have been the mainstay and principal capital provider of the group, declined in size due to the collapse of the Imperial Bank after the war, which resulted in reduced cohesion of the conglomerate. Many companies that were once part of the Mitsui Group have become independent or tied to other conglomerates. Specifically, Toshiba, Toyota Motors, and Suntory, once part of the Mitsui Group, became independent, with the Toyota Group becoming a conglomerate in its own right. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries(IHI Corporation) is now considered to be part of the Mizuho Group, and many companies in the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group are now more closely tied to the Sumitomo Group than the Mitsui Group. Recently there have been signs that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and the Mitsubishi Group could be taking over other parts of the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. Mitsukoshi merged into Isetan, a major department store with close ties to the Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ, to form Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings in April 2008. Makeup of the Mitsui Group Companies currently associated with the Mitsui keiretsu include Mitsui & Co., Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Japan Steel Works, Mitsui Chemicals, Mitsui Construction Co., Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding, Mitsui Fudosan, Mitsui-gold, Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., Ltd., Mitsui Oil Exploration Co.

Administration Quimper is the prefecture (capital) of the Finist√®re department. Geography The city was built on the confluence of the Steir, Odet and Jet rivers. Route National 165, D785, D765 and D783 were constructed to intersect here, northwest of Lorient, west of Rennes, and west-southwest of Paris. Etymology The name Quimper comes from the Breton kemper, meaning \\"confluent\\". History Quimper, with its vernacular architecture, is a popular tourist destination Quimper is the ancient capital of Cornouaille, Brittany‚Äôs most traditional region, and has a distinctive Breton Celtic character. Its name is the Breton word kemper (cognate to Welsh cymer), meaning \\"confluence\\". The town developed at the confluence of the rivers Le Steir and L'Odet. Shops and flags celebrate the region's Celtic heritage. Quimper was originally settled during Roman times. By AD 495, the town had become a Bishopric. It subsequently became the capital of the counts of Cornouailles. In the eleventh century, it was united with the Duchy of Brittany. During the War of the Breton Succession (1341‚Äì64), the town suffered considerable ruin. In 1364, the duchy passed to the House of Montfort. The town has a rustic atmosphere, with footbridges spanning the rivers that flow through it. The Church of Locmaria, a Romanesque structure, dates from the eleventh century. The Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, with its Gothic-style fa√ßade, was constructed between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is the oldest Gothic structure in lower Brittany. Its two towers are ; its spires were added in the nineteenth century. The fifteenth-century stained glass windows are exceptional. The cathedral is dedicated to Quimper's first bishop, Corentin. To the cathedral's west are the pedestrianized streets of Vieux Quimper (Old Quimper), which have a wide array of cr√™peries, half- timbered houses, and shops. Near the Episcopal palace, which now holds the Mus√©e d√©partemental Breton (devoted to regional history, archaeology, ethnology and economy) are the ruins of the town's fifteenth-century walls. Nearby is the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Quimper. The museum has a nineteenth- century fa√ßade and an entirely rebuilt interior. It houses a collection of fourteenth to twenty-first century paintings that includes works by Fran√ßois Boucher, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Jean-Baptiste Oudry and Peter Paul Rubens, along with canvases by such Pont-Aven School painters as √âmile Bernard, Maurice Denis, Georges Lacombe, Maxime Maufra and Paul S√©rusier. The town's best known product is Quimper faience, tin-glazed pottery. It has been made here since 1690, using bold provincial designs of Jean-Baptiste Bousquet. Quimper has a museum devoted to faience. The town‚Äôs eating establishments boast some of the best cr√™pes and cider in Brittany. The town has also been known for copper and bronze work, food items, galvanized ironware, hosiery, leather, paper and woolen goods. Climate Population Its inhabitants are called Quimp√©rois. Breton language The municipality launched a linguistic plan through Ya d'ar brezhoneg on 6 February 2008, to revive the teaching and use of Breton, the historic Celtic language of the region. In 2008, 4.61% of primary-school children attended bilingual schools. Ofis ar Brezhoneg: Enseignement bilingue Education Quimper has several schools.

A career diplomat and Private Secretary to Prime Minister Edward Heath, Hurd first entered Parliament in February 1974 as MP for the Mid Oxfordshire constituency (Witney from 1983). His first government post was as Minister for Europe from 1979 to 1983 (being that office's inaugural holder) and he served in several Cabinet roles from 1984 onwards, including Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1984‚Äì85), Home Secretary (1985‚Äì89) and Foreign Secretary (1989‚Äì95). He stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 1990, and retired from frontline politics during a Cabinet reshuffle in 1995.Douglas Hurd, Memoirs (2003). In 1997, Hurd was elevated to the House of Lords and is one of the Conservative Party's most senior elder statesmen. He is a patron of the Tory Reform Group. He retired from the Lords in 2016. Early life Order of the British Empire ribbon Hurd was born in 1930 in the market town of Marlborough in Wiltshire. His father Anthony Hurd (later Lord Hurd) and grandfather Sir Percy Hurd were also Members of Parliament. Douglas attended Twyford School and Eton College, where he was a King's Scholar and won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1947. He was also Captain of School (head boy).Hurd 2003, p52 After school Hurd did National Service, which he did not particularly enjoy, at a time when the Berlin Blockade made a Third World War seem far from unlikely. He began in July 1948 with a compulsory period in the ranks of the Royal Regiment of Artillery alongside young men of all social backgrounds. He later recorded that although living standards were no great shock after the spartan conditions at public school in those days, the petty dishonesty which he saw in the barrack room, and the waste of time which was so large a part of a conscript's experience, made him sceptical in later years of constituents' demands for a restoration of National Service.Hurd 2003, pp61-8 He was selected for officer training, attended Mons Officer Cadet School, Aldershot from November 1948, and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the 5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (as it was then called) at the start of March 1949.Hurd 2003, p64 He was released from the Army in September 1949 to take up his place at Cambridge University.Hurd 2003, p68 He trained for a few weeks each summer as a reserve officer until 1952.Hurd 2003, p85 Hurd went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in the autumn of 1949. He achieved an Upper Second (II:1) in his preliminary exams in summer 1950.Hurd 2003, p71 In March 1951 he was approached by an Admiral to be recruited to British Intelligence. He attended a selection panel, but withdrew from the process because, he later wrote, he did not want a career which would have to be pursued in secret.Hurd 2003, p77 Hurd's brother Julian, who was on the officer training course at Aldershot at the time, committed suicide in June 1951.Hurd 2003, p81 In his third year, Hurd served as Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association for Michaelmas (autumn) Term 1951 and President of the Cambridge Union Society in Easter (summer) Term 1952. His special subject for study was the Second French Republic,Hurd 2003, p71 and he graduated in 1952 with a first-class degree (BA) in history. In 1952, Hurd joined the Diplomatic Service. He was posted to China, the United States and Italy, before leaving the service in 1966 to enter politics as a member of the Conservative Party. Member of Parliament Hurd became Private Secretary (a political appointment, his salary paid by the Conservative Party) to Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, and was first elected to Parliament in February 1974 to represent the constituency of Mid Oxfordshire. After his election, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the February 1974 Dissolution Honours, gazetted on 2 April 1974. At the 1983 general election the seat was replaced by Witney and he remained MP for that seat until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1997 having served 23 years in Parliament. (From 2001 to 2016 this constituency was represented by the former Leader of the Conservative Party and former British prime minister, David Cameron.)Hurd, Memoirs (2003). =In government: 1979‚Äì1990= Hurd was appointed Minister of State at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office upon the Conservative victory in the 1979 general election and remained in that post for the duration of the Parliament. After the 1983 election Thatcher moved Hurd to the Home Office, but just over a year later he was promoted to Cabinet rank, succeeding James Prior as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In this position, his diplomatic skills paved the way for the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement on the future of Northern Ireland, which marked a turning point in British-Irish co-operation on the political situation in the troubled region. A month before the agreement was signed, however, Hurd returned to the Home Office, this time as Home Secretary, following the demotion of Leon Brittan to the Department of Trade and Industry. Widely seen as a \\"safe pair of hands\\" and a solid, loyal member of the Cabinet, Hurd's tenure as Home Secretary was largely uncontroversial, although he was notably of the view that Her Majesty's Prison Service did not work effectively and argued for more rehabilitation of offenders and alternative sentencing.Hurd, Memoirs (2003). He bought in the Public Order act, 1986, which created the crime of hate speech for speech which is \\"threatening, abusive or insulting\\" and which is spoken in public, with intent or likely to \\"stir up\\" racial hatred. =Candidature in the 1990 leadership election= Hurd's Cabinet career progressed further during the turbulent final months of Margaret Thatcher's prime ministership. On 26 October 1989, Hurd moved to the Foreign Office, succeeding John Major, whose rapid rise through the Cabinet saw him become Chancellor of the Exchequer in the wake of Nigel Lawson's resignation. In mid-November 1990, he supported Margaret Thatcher's candidature as Conservative Party leader against challenger Michael Heseltine, but on her withdrawal from the second round of the contest on 22 November, Hurd decided to enter the race as a moderate centre-right candidate, drawing on his reputation as a successful 'law-and-order' Home Secretary. He was seen as an outsider, lagging behind the more charismatic Heseltine and the eventual winner, John Major, who shared the moderate centre-right political ground with Hurd but had the added advantages of youth and political momentum. Hurd's Etonian education may have also been a disadvantage. He came third, winning 56 of the 372 votes cast and, together with Heseltine, conceded defeat to allow Major, who had fallen just three votes short of an outright majority, to return unopposed and take over as Prime Minister on 27 November 1990. Hurd was gracious in defeat and, on the formation of Major's first Cabinet, was returned to his position as Foreign Secretary. =Foreign Secretary= Hurd was widely regarded as a statesmanlike British Foreign Secretary, his tenure having been particularly eventful. He oversaw Britain's diplomatic responses to the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, as well as the first Gulf War to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. Hurd cultivated good relations with the United States under President George Bush Sr., and sought a more conciliatory approach to other members of the European Community, repairing relationships damaged during the increasingly Eurosceptic tone of Margaret Thatcher's final years. Hurd was a signatory of the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union in 1992. Hurd welcomed a reunified Germany into the European political community in 1990.Mark Stuart, Douglas Hurd: the public servant: an authorised biography (1998) One of the defining features of Hurd's tenure as Foreign Secretary was the British reaction to the Yugoslav Wars. During the war in Bosnia, Hurd was seen as a leading voice among European politicians arguing against sending military aid to the Bosniaks and for maintaining the arms embargo, in defiance of the line taken by US President Bill Clinton, and arguing that such a move would only create a 'level killing field' and prolong the conflict unduly. Hurd also resisted pressure to allow Bosnian refugees to enter into Britain arguing that to do so would reduce pressure on the Bosnian Government to sue for peace. Hurd described his and British policy during that time as 'realist'. Shortly after his withdrawal from frontline politics, Hurd travelled to Serbia to meet Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá on behalf of the British bank NatWest (see below), fuelling some speculation that Hurd had taken a pro-Serbian line. There has been criticism of Hurd's policies in relation to the war. The Bosnian government even threatened to charge Hurd as an accomplice to genocide before the War Tribunal at The Hague, though this came to nothing. In 2010 Hurd told a reporter that he was troubled by his Bosnia policy but still doubted that intervention would have brought about an earlier end to the war. Hurd was involved in a public scandal concerning Britain's funding of a hydroelectric dam on the Pergau River in Malaysia, near the Thai border. Building work began in 1991 with money from the British foreign aid budget. Concurrently, the Malaysian government bought around ¬£1 billion's worth of British-made arms. The suggested linkage of arms deals to aid became the subject of a UK Government inquiry from March 1994. In November 1994, after an application for Judicial Review brought by the World Development Movement, the High Court of Justice held that the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd's actions were ultra vires [outside his legal powers and therefore unlawful] by allocating ¬£234 million towards the funding of the dam, on the grounds that the legislation only empowered him to fund economically sound projects. In 1997, the administration of the UK's aid budget was removed from the Foreign Secretary's remit (previously the Overseas Development Administration had been under the supervision of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). The new department, the Department for International Development (DfID), has its own Secretary of State who is a member of the Cabinet. In 1995, during the Cabinet reshuffle widely seen as setting up the Conservative team which would contest the next election, Hurd retired from frontline politics after 11 years in the Cabinet and was replaced by Malcolm Rifkind. =Retirement= Insignia of a Companion of Honour After his retirement as Foreign Secretary, he remained a key supporter of John Major, and kept a range of active political involvements as well as taking on some business appointments, most notably as a Deputy Chairman of NatWest Markets and a Board Director of NatWest Group, posts he held from October 1995‚Äì99. Hurd left the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, and on 13 June 1997 was created Baron Hurd of Westwell, of Westwell in the County of Oxfordshire, which enabled him to continue sitting in Parliament as a member of the House of Lords. He retired from the Lords on 9 June 2016.Lord Hurd of Westwell, parliament.uk, 12 June 2016 In December 1997, Hurd was appointed Chairman of British Invisibles (now renamed International Financial Services London or IFSL). He was Chairman of the judging panel for the 1998 Booker Prize for Fiction. He became a member of the Royal Commission on the Reform of the House of Lords in February 1999, and in September 1999 he was appointed High Steward of Westminster Abbey, reflecting his long active membership of the Church of England. He later went on to chair the Hurd Commission which produced a review of the roles and functions of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Hurd is Chairman of the Advisory Council at FIRST, an international affairs organisation. Hurd was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1974 and Companion of Honour in the 1996 New Year Honours. He was formerly a Visiting Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford and Chairman of the German British Forum. On 17 July 2009, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (Hon DLitt) from Aston University at its Degree Congregation. Hurd is a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009. Personal life Hurd has married twice. In 1960, he married his first wife Tatiana, daughter of Major Arthur Eyre MBE, and their union produced three sons. The couple separated in 1976, and divorced in 1982. Tatiana Hurd cited her husband's career as the reason for their separation, saying, \\"Really, politics don't mix with marriage\\". In 1982 Hurd married Judy Smart, his former parliamentary secretary, who was 19 years his junior. They had two children, a boy and a girl. Judy Hurd died of leukaemia on 22 November 2008 in an Oxford hospital, aged 58. Hurd's eldest son, Nick Hurd, was Conservative Member of Parliament for Ruislip Northwood and Pinner from May 2005 to December 2019. In 2010, he was appointed Minister for Civil Society and married Lady Clare Kerr, daughter of the Marquess of Lothian. Hurd's second son, Thomas, joined the Diplomatic Service. His name appeared on a list of suspected MI6 operatives which was published on the Internet, as did Douglas himself, supposedly the work of disgruntled former SIS (MI6) or Security Service (MI5) employees. The authenticity of several entries on the list is questionable, leading to speculation that it was in fact compiled by a poorly informed amateur.The format of the list is taken from The Diplomatic Service List ‚Äì an annual official publication (known in Foreign and Commonwealth Office circles as The Green Book) listing all Diplomatic Service members. The Hon Thomas was appointed OBE in 2006, and is married with five children. His wife, Catherine, known as Sian, died on 21 May 2011, after falling from the roof of the building where they lived on East 84th Street in New York City. In 1988, Hurd set up the charity Crime Concern. Crime Concern worked to reduce crime, anti-social behaviour and the fear of crime, by working with young people, their families and adult offenders, offering opportunities through training and employment. Crime Concern merged with young people's charity Rainer in 2008 to become Catch22. Hurd is fluent in Mandarin, French and Italian. He is a patron of the pro EU European Movement UK.

Duke of Buckingham and Normanby was a title in the Peerage of England. The full title was Duke of the County of Buckingham and of Normanby but in practice only Duke of Buckingham and Normanby was used. The dukedom was created in 1703 for John Sheffield, 1st Marquess of Normanby KG, a notable Tory politician of the late Stuart period, who served under Queen Anne as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. He had succeeded his father as 3rd Earl of Mulgrave in 1658 and been made Marquess of Normanby in 1694. The duke's family descended from Sir Edmund Sheffield, second cousin of Henry VIII, who in 1547 was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Sheffield and in 1549 was murdered in the streets of Norwich during Kett's Rebellion. His grandson, the 3rd Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire from 1603 to 1619 and was created Earl of Mulgrave in 1626, also in the Peerage of England. On the death of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1735, all these titles became extinct. The Sheffield family estates passed to the 2nd duke's half-brother Charles Herbert‚Äîthe illegitimate son of the 1st Duke by Frances Stewart‚Äîwho changed his surname to Sheffield as a condition of the 2nd duke's will, thereby becoming Charles Herbert Sheffield.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1735 (9 Geo. 2). c. 20 Charles Herbert Sheffield was created a Baronet in 1755 and is the ancestor of the Sheffield Baronets, of Normanby. The Mulgrave title was used again in 1767 when Constantine Phipps was made Baron Mulgrave. He was the son of William Phipps and Lady Catherine Annesley (daughter and heiress of James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey and his wife Lady Catherine Darnley, illegitimate daughter of King James II by his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester). Lady Catherine Darnley later married John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and hence Constantine Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave was the step-grandson of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. In 1838 also the Normanby title was used again when the 1st Baron Mulgrave's grandson Constantine was made Marquess of Normanby. These titles are still extant.

GlobalSecurity.org The group's mottos were \\"The armed struggle and right political line are the way to Armenia\\" and \\"Viva the revolutionary solidarity of oppressed people!\\" G. Yazchian, Thirty years ago this day was born ASALA, Azg daily, Yerevan, January 20, 2005 Origins and history One hundred years had passed since the Ottoman Empire had embarked on the campaign to exterminate its Armenian population, which was largely concentrated in its eastern provinces, referred to at the time as Western Armenia. The survivors of the massacres and deprivations commonly seen in the death marches found refuge in other countries in Western Asia, as well as in Western Europe and North America. While the key ringleaders of the genocide were assassinated in the 1920s by Armenians (see Operation Nemesis), the Ottoman Empire's successor, the Republic of Turkey, stated that a genocide had not taken place. It actively campaigned against any and all attempts to publicise the events and bring about recognition in the West. It blamed Armenians for instigating the violence and alleged that Armenians had massacred thousands of Turks, prompting the commencement of their deportations. In 1965, Armenians around the world publicly marked the 50th anniversary and began to campaign for world recognition. As peaceful marches and demonstrations failed to move an intransigent Turkey, the younger generation of Armenians, resentful at the denial by Turkey and the failure by their parents' generation to effect change, sought new approaches to bringing about recognition and reparations.Paul Moussault (red.) & Barbara Sahakian, ‚ÄúASALA de Nemesis voor de Armeense genocide. Stadsguerrilla tegen Turkije (1975‚Äì1988)‚Äù, Amsterdam, 2015. In 1973, two Turkish diplomats were assassinated in Los Angeles by Kourken Yanigian, an elderly man who survived the Armenian Genocide. This event might have been forgotten had it not initiated a chain of events which turned it, and its perpetrator, into a symbol representing the end of the conspiracy of silence which since 1915 had surrounded the Armenian Genocide. ASALA was founded in 1975 (thought to correspond to the 60th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide) in Beirut, Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War by Hagop Hagopian (Harutiun Tagushian), pastor Reverend James KarnusianRev.

Helen Chapin Metz. Washington, D.C.: The Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress, 283, 354‚Äì355 Another major figure in the establishment of ASALA was Hagop Darakjian, who was a driving force in the earlier operations of the group. Darakjian headed the group for a period of time between 1976 and 1977 when Hagopian was unable to lead due to injuries sustained from his involvement with the Palestinians. At the beginning, ASALA bore the name of \\"The Prisoner Kurken Yanikian Group\\".Near East/South Asia Report, by United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service, United States Joint Publications Research Service, 1987, p. 3 Consisting primarily of Lebanese-born Armenians of the Diaspora (whose parents and/or grandparents were survivors of the genocide), the organization followed a theoretical model based on leftist ideology.Roy, Olivier. Turkey Today: A European Nation? p. 169. ASALA was critical of its political predecessors and Diasporan parties, accusing them of failing to deal with the problems of the Armenian people.Armenians in London: The Management of Social Boundaries, by Vered Amit Talai, Vered Amit, Manchester University Press, 1989, p. 27 The apex of the group's structure was the General Command of the People of Armenia (VAN).The Middle East Annual: Issues & Events, 1984, edited by David H. Partington, p. 155 The group's activities were primarily assassinations of Turkish diplomats and politicians in Western Europe, the United States and Western Asia. Their first acknowledged killing was the assassination of the Turkish diplomat, Dani≈ü Tunalƒ±gil, in Vienna on October 22, 1975. A failed attack in Geneva on October 3, 1980, in which two Armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group, the 3 October Organization. ASALA's eight-point manifesto was published in 1981. The approximate territory claimed by ASALA ASALA, trained in the Beirut camps of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is the best known of the guerrilla groups responsible for assassinations of at least 36 Turkish diplomats. Since 1975, a couple of dozen Turkish diplomats or members of their families had been targeted in a couple of dozens of attacks, with the outcome that the Armenian vengeance, as well as the background to the Armenian struggle, have made it to the world press. These notable acts, while carried out by a small group, were successful in conveying the Armenian Genocide to the forefront of international awareness. Political objectives The main two political goals of ASALA were to get Turkey to recognize its culpability for the Armenian Genocide in 1915 and to establish a United Armenia, which would unite nearby regions formerly under Armenian control or with large Armenian populations. Additionally, ASALA stated in a Cypriot newspaper in 1983 that it supported the Soviet Union and aimed to garner support from other Soviet republics toward the cause of eliminating Turkish colonialism. These goals helped shape the following political objectives: #Force an end to Turkish colonialism by using revolutionary violence #Attack institutions and representatives of Turkey and of countries supporting Turkey #Affirm scientific socialism as the main ideology of Armenia Historian Fatma G√∂√ßek describes the stated aims of ASALA as \\"righteous\\" but the means sought for these aims, i.e. the \\"wilful murder [of] innocent people\\" as not righteous, and thus argues that it was a terrorist organisation. Linkages ASALA had ties to Palestinian liberation groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Marxist militant group in which ASALA founder Hagop Hagopian was rumored to have been a member in his youth. Through his involvement with Palestinian groups, Hagopian earned the nickname \\"Mujahed,\\" meaning \\"Warrior.\\" Hagopian's sympathetic connection with Palestinian liberation/separatist movements bolstered ASALA's goals and helped pave the way for ASALA's eventual training with another Palestinian rebel group, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). =Possible linkages= ASALA was rumored to have interacted with other leftist/Marxist militant organizations in Europe and Eurasia, including the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) in Kurdistan, the Italian Red Brigades, and the Spanish Basque liberation group ETA. In addition to having potential connections to leftist groups, ASALA also had ties to another Armenian organization, the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG), who, while a right-wing nationalist group that often competed with ASALA, had similar political goals regarding wanting Turkey to acknowledge its role in the Armenian Genocide and wanting the establishment of an Armenian homeland. Differences from the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide Because ASALA shared similar political goals with the right-wing militant group the Justice Commandos for the Armenian Genocide (also known as the Armenian Revolutionary Army), the groups are often compared or confused; however, ASALA sets itself apart from JCAG because of its Marxist/leftist ideology. ASALA often aligned itself with the Soviet Union, while JCAG's nationalist goals were more focused on establishing an independent Armenian state. Whereas JCAG wanted a free and independent Armenia separate from the Soviet Union, ASALA considered the Soviet Union a \\"friendly country;\\" because of this, ASALA was content with remaining a part of the USSR so long as the other parts of the Armenian homeland could be united within the entity of the Armenian S.S.R. In addition to having different ideologies, ASALA and JCAG also carried out their attacks in different styles. ASALA was much more prone to using explosives in its attacks rather than firearms as JCAG favored. ASALA used explosives in 146 of 186 incidents/attacks compared to using firearms in only 33 attacks. By comparison, JCAG used explosives in 23 of its 47 attacks and used firearms in 26 of its 47 attacks. Attacks According to the MIPT website, there had been 84 incidents involving ASALA leaving 46 dead and 299 injured, including the following: On October 22, 1975, Turkish Ambassador in Austria, Danis Tunaligil was assassinated by three members of ASALA. Two days later, the Turkish Ambassador in France, Ismail Erez and his chauffeur were killed. Both ASALA and JCAG claimed responsibility. The first two ASALA militants, arrested on October 3, 1980, were Alex Yenikomshian and Suzy Mahserejian, who were wounded after the accidental explosion of a bomb in a hotel in Geneva.Le Combat armenien: entre terrorisme et utopie : Lausanne, 1923‚Äì1983, by Armand Gaspard, L'AGE D'HOMME, 1984, p. 72 During the 1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris (Van operation) ASALA militants held 56 hostages for fifteen hours; it became the first operation of its kind. Militants demanded release of political prisoners in Turkey including two Armenian clergymen, 5 Turks and 5 Kurds.Guerilla threat to kill 40 in Paris siege, The Sydney Morning Herald, Sep. 25, 1981, p. 3 Coverage of the takeover received one of the highest television ratings in France in 1981.Children of Armenia, by M. Bobelian, Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. 159 Among those who supported the militants during the trial were Henri Verneuil,Le proc√©s des Arm√©niens, Paris, traduit du fran√ßais par Grigor Djanikian, editions VMV-Print, Erevan, 2010, p. 200 M√©lin√©e Manouchian, the widow of the French resistance hero, Missak Manouchian, and singer Liz Sarian. One of the most known attacks of ASALA was Esenboga airport attack on August 7, 1982, in Ankara, when its members targeted non-diplomat civilians for the first time. Two militants opened fire in a crowded passenger waiting room. One of the shooters took more than 20 hostages while the second was apprehended by police. Altogether, nine people died and 82 were injured. The arrested militant Levon Ekmekjian condemned the attack in its aftermath and appealed to other members of ASALA to stop the violence. On August 10, 1982, Artin Penik a Turk of Armenian descent, set himself on fire in protest of this attack. On July 15, 1983, ASALA carried out an attack at the Orly Airport near Paris, in which 8 people were killed and 55 were injured, most of them not being Turks.Brian Forst, Jack R. Greene, James P. Lynch. Criminologists on Terrorism and Homeland Security. Cambridge University Press, 2011. , 9780521899451, p. 431Council of Europe, Documents, Vol. 1, May 1984, Report by Amadei, p. 9 The attack resulted in a split in ASALA, between those individuals who carried it out, and those who believed the attack to be counterproductive. The split resulted in emergence of two groups, the ASALA-Militant led by Hagopian and the 'Revolutionary Movement' (ASALA-Mouvement R√©volutionnaire) led by Monte Melkonian.Harvey W. Kushner. Encyclopedia of terrorism. SAGE, 2002. , , p. 47 While Melkonian's faction insisted on attacks strictly against Turkish officials and the Turkish government, Hagopian's group disregarded the losses of unintended victims and regularly executed dissenting members. Afterwards, French forces promptly arrested those involved.\\"French Hold Armenians In Orly Airport Bombing\\", Associated Press, The New York Times, October 9, 1983. Moreover, this attack eliminated the suspected secret agreement that the French socialist government made with ASALA, in which the government would allow ASALA to use France as a base of operations in exchange for refraining from launching attacks on French soil. Belief in this suspected agreement was further bolstered after \\"Interior Minister Gaston Defferre called ASALA's cause \\"just\\", and four Armenians arrested for taking hostages at the Turkish Embassy in September 1981 were given light sentences.\\"Echikson, William. \\"Armenian bombing at Orly ends pact between Socialists and terrorists\\", The Christian Science Monitor, July 19, 1983. France was free of ASALA attacks after this concession until the government arrested suspected bomber Vicken Tcharkutian. ASALA only agreed to temporarily halt its attacks once more when France did not extradite Tcharkutian to the United States. ASALA interacted and negotiated with a number of other European governments during its peak in order to make political or organizational gains. ASALA stopped its attacks in Switzerland on two occasions in order to expedite the release of certain Armenian prisoners, as well as after a Swiss judge disagreed with the Turkish government's refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide and other mistreatments of the Armenian people. Additionally, ASALA negotiated with the Italian government in 1979 in exchange for a halt in attacks provided that Italy close its Armenian emigration offices. When Italy agreed to ASALA's request, it saw no further attacks from the group. =Reactions= Continuous attacks by ASALA prompted Turkey to accuse Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding ASALA. Although they publicly distanced themselves from ASALA, Turkey's Armenian community came under attack by Turkish nationalists in reaction to the group's actions. This became apparent after the assassination of Ahmet Benler on October 12, 1979, by Armenian militants in the Hague. The reaction to the attack led to the bombing of the church of the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate in Istanbul on October 19 in retaliation.Tessa, Hofmann. Armenians in Turkey today In 1980, the Turkish government arrested Armenian priest Fr. Manuel Yergatian at the Istanbul airport for the alleged possession of maps that indicated Armenian territory within modern-day Turkey and was sentenced to 14 years in prison for possible ties with ASALA. Amnesty International adopted him as a prisoner of conscience, concluding that the evidence against him was baseless. According to Tessa Hofmann, Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups. The ASALA memorial in the military cemetery of Yerablur, Yerevan In April 2000 the opening ceremony of \\"In Memory of killed ASALA commandos\\" monument took place at Armenian military pantheon Yerablur with participation of Greek anti-fascist resistance leader Manolis Glezos and other special guests.Arax Monthly, No. 4, 2000, Tehran, p. 4 =Counteroffensive= After the ASALA attack against the Esenboƒüa International Airport in August 1982 the then President of Turkey Kenan Evren issued a decree for the elimination of ASALA. The task was given to the National Intelligence Organization's Foreign Operations Department. Evren's own daughter, a member of the Mƒ∞T, ran the operation together with Foreign Intelligence Department chief Metin (Mete) G√ºnyol, and Istanbul region director Nuri G√ºnde≈ü. Levon Ekmekjian was captured and placed in Ankara's Mamak Prison. He was told that he had to choose between confessing and being executed. After being promised that his comrades would not be harmed, he revealed how ASALA worked to a team led by Mƒ∞T's Presidential Liaison and Evren's son-in-law, Erkan G√ºrvit. He was tried by Ankara martial law command military court, and sentenced to death. His appeal of the sentence was declined, and he was hanged on 29 January 1983.BBC, February 2, 1983. Armenian terrorist executed in Turkey. In the early spring of 1983 two teams were sent to France and Lebanon. G√ºnyol tapped contract killer Abdullah √áatlƒ±, who had just finished serving a prison sentence in Switzerland for drug trafficking, to lead the French contingent. G√ºnyol says he did not reveal his identity to √áatlƒ±, who referred to him as \\"Colonel\\", thinking G√ºnyol used to be a soldier. A second French unit was assembled under Mƒ∞T operative Sabah Ketene. The Lebanese contingent, consisting only of Mƒ∞T operatives and members of the \\"Special Warfare Department\\" (special forces), was led by Mƒ∞T officer Hiram Abas. The bomb that √áatlƒ±'s team had planted in Ara Toranyan's car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A follow-up attempt also failed. Toranyan said they had planted the bomb in the wrong car. Likewise, Henri Papazyan's car bomb on 1 May 1984 did not explode. √áatlƒ± claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however he was in a French prison (again, on narcotics charges) at the time of the attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which √áatlƒ± also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did anything at all. Dissolution With the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 the group lost much of its organization and support. Previously sympathetic Palestinian organizations, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), withdrew their support and passed materials to the French intelligence services in 1983, detailing ASALA operatives. One of the group's last attacks, on 19 December 1991, targeted the bullet-proof limousine carrying the Turkish Ambassador to Budapest. The ambassador was not injured in the attack, which was claimed by ASALA in Paris. ASALA's founder Hagop Hagopian was assassinated on a sidewalk in an affluent neighborhood in Athens, Greece on April 28, 1988. He was shot several times while he was walking with two women at 4:30 in the morning.Melkonian, Markar. My Brother's Road: An American's Fateful Journey to Armenia. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005 pg. 187. Veteran member Hagop Tarakchian died of cancer in 1980. Assassinations of former members of ASALA-RM continued in Armenia into the late 1990s.Melkonian, Markar. My Brother's Road: An American's Fateful Journey to Armenia. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005, pp. 277‚Äì278. According to Turkish National Intelligence Organization official Nuri G√ºnde≈ü, ASALA was dissolved after the assassination of Hagopian. According to Turkish sources, another reason is that financial backing was withdrawn by the Armenian diaspora after the 1983 Orly Airport attack. Although ASALA attacks all but stopped in the late 1980s as a result of the group's fragmentation and lack of support after the 1983 Orly attack, ASALA still continued in a lesser capacity into the 1990s, even after the group suffered further disorganization after Hagopian's assassination in 1988. In addition to the ASALA-claimed 1991 attack on the Turkish ambassador in Budapest, ASALA's last claimed attack (although some members of ASALA have refuted this) was in Brussels in 1997. Bombers attacking under the name Gourgen Yanikian (which was traditionally associated with ASALA) bombed the Turkish embassy in Brussels. ASALA has been inactive ever since. Publications / organs Hayasdan An ASALA publication (1995) Since the 1970s the ASALA Information Branch published books, booklets, posters and other promotional materials. Hayasdan ('Armenia') was the official multi-lingual organ of ASALA published in 1980‚Äì1987 and 1991‚Äì1997. The first issue was published in October 1980 and contained 40 pages.Mamule 1967‚Äì1980, by Zhirair Danielyan, Haigazian handes, hador T, 1981 The place of publication and names of contributors are not known. It was published monthly, sometimes with united volumes. The main language was Armenian. From 1983 to 1987 it had separate issues in Arabic, English, French and Turkish.The Armenian Question, encyclopedia, Ed. by acad. K. Khudaverdyan, Yerevan, 1996, p. 209, Hayaqsdan by A.

Though YUM has a command-line interface, several other tools provide graphical user interfaces to YUM functionality. YUM allows for automatic updates and package and dependency management on RPM- based distributions. Like the Advanced Package Tool (APT) from Debian, YUM works with software repositories (collections of packages), which can be accessed locally or over a network connection. Under the hood, YUM depends on RPM, which is a packaging standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither YUM nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by end-users. YUM is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as YUM Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of YUM named DNF replaced YUM as the default package manager in Fedora 22. DNF was created to improve on YUM in several ways - improved performance, better resolution of dependency conflicts, and easier integration with other software applications.  History  The original package manager, Yellowdog UPdater (YUP) was developed in 1999-2001 by Dan Burcaw, Bryan Stillwell, Stephen Edie, and Troy Bengegerdes at Terra Soft Solutions (under the leadership of then CEO Kai Staats) as a back-end engine for a graphical installer of Yellow Dog Linux. As a full rewrite of YUP, YUM evolved primarily to update and manage Red Hat Linux systems used at the Duke University Department of Physics by Seth Vidal and Michael Stenner. Vidal continued to contribute to YUM until his death in a Durham, North Carolina bicycle accident on 8 July 2013. In 2003 Robert G. Brown at Duke published documentation for YUM. Subsequent adopters included Fedora, CentOS, and many other RPM-based Linux distributions, including Yellow Dog Linux itself, where YUM replaced the original YUP utility ‚Äî last updated on SourceForge in 2001. By 2005, it was estimated to be in use on over half of the Linux market, and by 2007 YUM was considered the \\"tool of choice\\" for RPM-based Linux distributions. YUM aimed to address both the perceived deficiencies in the old APT-RPM, and restrictions of the Red Hat up2date package management tool. YUM superseded up2date in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later. Some authors refer to YUM as the Yellowdog Update Manager, or suggest that \\"Your Update Manager\\" would be more appropriate. A basic knowledge of YUM is often included as a requirement for Linux system-administrator certification. The GNU General Public License of YUM allows the free and open-source software to be freely distributed and modified without any royalty, if other terms of the license are honored. While yum was originally created for Linux, it has been ported to a number of other operating systems including AIX, IBM i, and ArcaOS.  Operations  \`YUM\` can perform operations such as: * installing packages * deleting packages * updating existing installed packages * listing available packages * listing installed packages  Extensions  Screenshot of Yum Extender (yumex) The 2.x versions of YUM feature an additional interface for programming extensions in Python that allows the behavior of YUM to be altered. Certain plug-ins are installed by default. A commonly installed package \`yum-utils\`, contains commands which use the YUM API, and many plugins. Graphical user interfaces, known as \\"front-ends\\", allow easier use of YUM. PackageKit and Yum Extender (yumex) are two examples.  Metadata  Information about packages (as opposed to the packages themselves) is known as metadata. These metadata are combined with information in each package to determine (and resolve, if possible) dependencies among the packages. The hope is to avoid a situation known as dependency hell. A separate tool, \`createrepo\`, sets up YUM software repositories, generating the necessary metadata in a standard XML format (and the SQLite metadata if given the -d option). The \`mrepo\` tool (formerly known as Yam) can help in the creation and maintenance of repositories. YUM's XML repository, built with input from many other developers, quickly became the standard for RPM-based repositories. Besides the distributions that use YUM directly, SUSE Linux 10.1 added support for YUM repositories in YaST, and the Open Build Service repositories use the YUM XML repository format metadata. YUM automatically synchronizes the remote meta data to the local client, with other tools opting to synchronize only when requested by the user.

He was the leading classicist painter of the German 19th-century school. Biography =Early life= Anselm Feuerbach (1852) by Thomas Couture. Francesca da Rimini und Paolo Malatesta c. 1864 Plato's Symposium, 1869 Nanna, 1861, Germanisches Nationalmuseum Feuerbach was born at Speyer, the son of the archaeologist Joseph Anselm Feuerbach and the grandson of the legal scholar Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach. The house of his birth is now a small museum. Between 1845 and 1848 he attended the D√ºsseldorf Academy, where he was taught by Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, Wilhelm von Schadow, and Carl Sohn. He went on to the Munich Academy, but in 1850, along with a number of other dissatisfied students, he moved to the academy at Antwerp, where he studied under Gustav Wappers. Feuerbach moved to Paris in 1851, where he was a pupil of Thomas Couture until 1854.Artist biography in German Masters of the Nineteenth Century, p.268 It was in Paris that he produced his first masterpiece, Hafiz at the Fountain (1852). In 1854, funded by Grand Duke Friedrich of Baden he visited Venice, where he fell under the spell of the greatest school of colourists, several of his works demonstrating a close study of the Italian masters. From there he continued to Florence and then to Rome. He remained in Rome until 1873, making brief visits back to Germany. In 1861 he met Anna Risi (known as \\"Nanna\\"), who sat as his model for the next four years. In 1866 she was succeeded as his principal model by Lucia Brunacci, an innkeeper's wife who posed for his pictures of Medea. In 1862 Feuerbach met Count Adolf Friedrich von Schack, who commissioned copies of Italian old masters from him. The count introduced him to Arnold B√∂cklin and Hans von Mar√©es. The three artists became known as the Deutschr√∂mer (\\"German Romans\\") because of their preference for Italian over German art. Between 1869 and 1874 he painted two versions of Plato's Symposium. In 1873 Feuerbach moved to Vienna, having been appointed professor of history painting at the Academy. Among his students Ludwig Deutsch, Rudolf Ernst and Jean Discart. later, Feuerbach developed a disagreement with architect Theophil Hansen over his ceiling mural The Fall of the Titans, painted for the Great Hall of the new Academy building on the Ringstrasse. While in Vienna he came to know Johannes Brahms. Brahms later dedicated a composition to Feuerbach, N√§nie. =Last years= Iphigenia, first (1862) version (Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt) In 1877 he resigned from his post at the Vienna Academy and moved to Venice, where he died in 1880. Brahms composed N√§nie, a piece for chorus and orchestra, in his memory. Following his death, his step-mother Henriette, to whom he had always been close, and who had always done much to promote his career, wrote a book entitled Ein Verm√§chtnis (\\"A Testament\\" or \\"A Legacy\\"), including his letters and autobiographical notes. It proved enormously successful and greatly enhanced his posthumous reputation.Schiff, Gert, \\"An Epoch of longing\\" in German Masters of the Nineteenth Century, pp.24‚Äì7 According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: > He was steeped in classic knowledge, and his figure compositions have the > statuesque dignity and simplicity of Greek art. He was the first to realize > the danger arising from contempt of technique, that mastery of craftsmanship > was needed to express even the loftiest ideas, and that an ill-drawn > coloured cartoon can never be the supreme achievement in art.Encyclop√¶dia > Britannica, 1911 His works are housed at leading public galleries in Germany. Stuttgart has the second version of Iphigenia; Karlsruhe, the Dante at Ravenna; Munich, the Medea; and Berlin, The Concert, his last important painting.

In mid-May, 2004, in the leadup to the 2004 election, Horinko was questioned in the media relative to an EPA rule about industrial laundry and toxic waste, on the one hand, and gifts to the Bush campaign, particularly by Cintas Corporation founder and Bush Pioneer fundraiser Richard T. Farmer, on the other. Cintas, headquartered in the greater Cincinnati area in the electoral-battleground state of Ohio, was then the biggest company in the industrial laundry business. \\"In a summary of the rule, the EPA said it would improve 'clarity and consistency' of regulation, 'provide regulatory relief, and save affected facilities over $30 million'\\" by allowing industrial shop towels to be washed in water that would then go into municipal waste-water treatment systems.

The domain was originally intended for non-profit entities, but this restriction was removed in August 2019. The domain is commonly used by schools, open-source projects, and communities, but also by some for-profit entities. The number of registered domains in org has increased from fewer than one million in the 1990s, to ten million in 2012, and held steady between ten and eleven million since then. In November 2019, the Public Interest Registry (PIR) was to be sold by the Internet Society to shell company Ethos Capital for US$1.135 billion. The PIR also announced it would abandon its non-profit status to become a B Corporation. However, this move was criticized by non-profits and various digital rights groups on concerns that Ethos Capital, a private equity firm, would raise fees or censor the domain. The sale was blocked by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in April 2020 on the basis that transfer of control of the domain to the private equity firm would create \\"unacceptable uncertainty\\" for non-profits that relied on the org domain.

In some cases subdomains have been created for crisis management. The number of ORG domains registered with the Public Interest Registry.Although organizations anywhere in the world may register subdomains, many countries, such as Australia (au), Canada (ca), Japan (jp), Argentina (ar), Bolivia (bo), Uruguay (uy), Turkey (tr), Somalia (so), Sierra Leone (sl), Russia (ru), Bangladesh (bd), India (in) and the United Kingdom (uk), have established a second-level domain with a similar purpose under their ccTLD. Such second-level domains are usually named org or or. In 2009, the org domain consisted of more than 8 million registered domain names, 8.8 million in 2010, and 9.6 million in 2011. The Public Interest Registry registered the ten millionth .ORG domain in June, 2012. When the 9.5 millionth second-level domain was registered in December 2011, org became the third largest gTLD.

Though colloquially often known as bombs, they are not explosives but in fact are designed to slow the process of chemical reactions and use ignition rather than detonation to start or maintain the reaction. Napalm for example, is petroleum especially thickened with certain chemicals into a 'gel' to slow, but not stop, combustion, releasing energy over a longer time than an explosive device. In the case of napalm, the gel adheres to surfaces and resists suppression. Pre-modern history A range of early thermal weapons were utilized by ancient and early armies, including hot pitch, oil, resin, animal fat and other similar compounds. Substances such as quicklime and sulfur could be toxic and blinding. Incendiary mixtures, such as the petroleum-based Greek fire, were launched by throwing machines or administered through a siphon. Sulfur- and oil-soaked materials were sometimes ignited and thrown at the enemy, or attached to spears, arrow and bolts and fired by hand or machine. Some siege techniques--such as mining and boring-- relied on combustibles and fire to complete the collapse of walls and structures. Towards the latter part of the period, gunpowder was invented, which increased the sophistication of the weapons, starting with fire lances. Development and use in World War I An incendiary bomb dropped on Southend- on-Sea in 1916 The first incendiary devices to be dropped during World War I fell on coastal towns in the south west of England on the night of 18‚Äì19 January 1915. The small number of German bombs, also known as firebombs, were finned containers filled with kerosene and oil and wrapped with tar-covered rope. They were dropped from Zeppelin airships. On 8 September 1915, Zeppelin L-13 dropped a large number of firebombs, but even then the results were poor and they were generally ineffective in terms of the damage inflicted. They did have a considerable effect on the morale of the civilian population of the United Kingdom.Wilbur Cross, \\"Zeppelins of World War I\\" page 35, published 1991 Paragon House ISBN I-56619-390-7 After further experiments with 5-litre barrels of benzol, in 1918, the B-1E Elektron fire bomb (German: Elektronbrandbombe) was developed by scientists and engineers at the Griesheim-Elektron chemical works. The bomb was ignited by a thermite charge, but the main incendiary effect was from the magnesium and aluminium alloy casing, which ignited at 650¬∞ Celsius, burned at 1,100 ¬∞C and emitted vapour that burned at 1,800 ¬∞C. A further advantage of the alloy casing was its lightness, being a quarter of the density of steel, which meant that each bomber could carry a considerable number.Hanson, Neil (2009), First Blitz, Corgi Books, (pp. 406‚Äì408) The German High Command devised an operation called \\"The Fire Plan\\" (German: Der Feuerplan), which involved the use of the whole German heavy bomber fleet, flying in waves over London and Paris and dropping all the incendiary bombs that they could carry, until they were either all shot down or the crews were too exhausted to fly. The hope was that the two capitals would be engulfed in an inextinguishable blaze, causing the Allies to sue for peace.Hanson, pp. 413‚Äì414 Thousands of Elektron bombs were stockpiled at forward bomber bases and the operation was scheduled for August and again in early September 1918, but on both occasions, the order to take off was countermanded at the last moment, perhaps because of the fear of Allied reprisals against German cities.Hanson, pp. 437‚Äì438 The Royal Air Force had already used their own \\"Baby\\" Incendiary Bomb (BIB) which also contained a thermite charge. A plan to fire bomb New York with new long range Zeppelins of the L70 class was proposed by the naval airship fleet commander Peter Strasser in July 1918, but it was vetoed by Admiral Reinhard Scheer.Hanson, p. 412 Development and use in World War II A German World War II 1 kg incendiary bomb Incendiary bombs were used extensively in World War II as an effective bombing weapon, often in a conjunction with high-explosive bombs.World War II Guide. Probably the most famous incendiary attacks are the bombing of Dresden and the bombing of Tokyo on 10 March 1945. Many different configurations of incendiary bombs and a wide range of filling materials such as isobutyl methacrylate (IM) polymer, napalm, and similar jellied-petroleum formulas were used, many of them developed by the US Chemical Warfare Service. Different methods of delivery, e.g. small bombs, bomblet clusters and large bombs, were tested and implemented. For example, a large bomb casing was filled with small sticks of incendiary (bomblets); the casing was designed to open at altitude, scattering the bomblets in order to cover a wide area. An explosive charge would then ignite the incendiary material, often starting a raging fire. The fire would burn at extreme temperatures that could destroy most buildings made of wood or other combustible materials (buildings constructed of stone tend to resist incendiary destruction unless they are first blown open by high explosives). Burning ballroom at the Royal Castle, Warsaw, as a result of incendiary bombing by the German Luftwaffe The German Luftwaffe started the war using the 1918-designed one-kilogram magnesium alloy B-1E Elektronbrandbombe; later modifications included the addition of a small explosive charge intended to penetrate the roof of any building which it landed on. Racks holding 36 of these bombs were developed, four of which could, in turn, be fitted to an electrically triggered dispenser so that a single He 111 bomber could carry 1,152 incendiary bombs, or more usually a mixed load. Less successful was the Flammenbombe, a 250 kg or 500 kg high explosive bomb case filled with an inflammable oil mixture, which often failed to detonate and was withdrawn in January 1941. In World War II, incendiaries were principally developed in order to destroy the many small, decentralised war industries located (often intentionally) throughout vast tracts of city land in an effort to escape destruction by conventionally aimed high-explosive bombs. Nevertheless, the civilian destruction caused by such weapons quickly earned them a reputation as terror weapons with the targeted populations. The Nazi regime began the campaign of incendiary bombings at the start of World War II with the bombing of Warsaw, and continued with the London Blitz and the bombing of Moscow, among other cities. Later, an extensive reprisal was enacted by the Allies in the strategic bombing campaign that led to the near- annihilation of many German cities. In the Pacific War, during the last seven months of strategic bombing by B-29 Superfortresses in the air war against Japan, a change to firebombing tactics resulted in the death of 500,000 Japanese and the homelessness of five million more. Sixty-seven Japanese cities lost significant areas to incendiary attacks. The most deadly single bombing raid in history was Operation Meetinghouse, an incendiary attack that killed some 100,000 Tokyo residents in one night. British I.B. 4-lb. Mk IV type incendiary bomb.

RAF Bomber Command dropped 80 million of these 4 lb incendiary bombs during World War II. The 4 lb bomb was also used by the US as the \\"AN-M50\\". The incendiary bomb, developed by ICI, was the standard light incendiary bomb used by RAF Bomber Command in very large numbers, declining slightly in 1944 to 35.8 million bombs produced (the decline being due to more bombs arriving from the United States). It was the weapon of choice for the British \\"dehousing\\" plan. The bomb consisted of a hollow body made from aluminium-magnesium alloy with a cast iron/steel nose, and filled with thermite incendiary pellets. It was capable of burning for up to ten minutes. There was also a high explosive version and delayed high explosive versions (2‚Äì4 minutes) which were designed to kill rescuers and firefighters. It was normal for a proportion of high explosive bombs to be dropped during incendiary attacks in order to expose combustible material and to fill the streets with craters and rubble, hindering rescue services.

Articles in late 1944 claimed that the flame was so hot it could crumble a brick wall. For propaganda purposes the RAF dubbed the new incendiary bomb the Superflamer.\\"SUPERFLAMER Dropped by Chute Throws Fire 15 Feet.\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1944, p. 13. Article bottom of page. Around fifty-five million incendiary bombs were dropped on Germany by Avro Lancasters alone. Many incendiary weapons developed and deployed during World War II were in the form of bombs and shells whose main incendiary component is white phosphorus (WP), and can be used in an offensive anti-personnel role against enemy troop concentrations, but WP is also used for signalling, smoke screens, and target- marking purposes. The U.S. Army and Marines used WP extensively in World War II and Korea for all three purposes, frequently using WP shells in large 4.2-inch chemical mortars. WP was widely credited by many Allied soldiers for breaking up numerous German infantry attacks and creating havoc among enemy troop concentrations during the latter part of World War II. In both World War II and Korea, WP was found particularly useful in overcoming enemy human wave attacks. Post World War II incendiary weapons Modern incendiary bombs usually contain thermite, made from aluminium and ferric oxide. It takes very high temperatures to ignite, but when alight, it can burn through solid steel. In World War II, such devices were employed in incendiary grenades to burn through heavy armour plate, or as a quick welding mechanism to destroy artillery and other complex machined weapons. A variety of pyrophoric materials can also be used: selected organometallic compounds, most often triethylaluminium, trimethylaluminium, and some other alkyl and aryl derivatives of aluminium, magnesium, boron, zinc, sodium, and lithium, can be used. Thickened triethylaluminium, a napalm-like substance that ignites in contact with air, is known as thickened pyrophoric agent, or TPA. Napalm was widely used by the United States during the Korean War, most notably during the battle \\"Outpost Harry\\" in South Korea during the night of June 10‚Äì11, 1953. Eighth Army chemical officer Donald Bode reported that on an \\"average good day\\" UN pilots used 70,000 gallons of napalm, with approximately 60,000 gallons of this thrown by US forces. Winston Churchill, among others, criticized American use of napalm in Korea, calling it \\"very cruel\\", as the US/UN forces, he said, were \\"splashing it all over the civilian population\\", \\"tortur[ing] great masses of people\\". The American official who took this statement declined to publicize it. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force developed the CBU-55, a cluster bomb incendiary fuelled by propane, a weapon that was used only once in warfare.Alan Dawson, 55 Days: The Fall of South Vietnam (Prentice-Hall 1977). Napalm however, became an intrinsic element of U.S. military action during the Vietnam War as forces made increasing use of it for its tactical and psychological effects. Reportedly about 388,000 tons of U.S. napalm bombs were dropped in the region between 1963 and 1973, compared to 32,357 tons used over three years in the Korean War, and 16,500 tons dropped on Japan in 1945. Napalm proper is no longer used by the United States, although the kerosene-fuelled Mark 77 MOD 5 Firebomb is currently in use.

Background McKevitt, a native of County Louth, joined the Provisional IRA during the outbreak of the Troubles. In February 1975 he was shot in the knees by the Official IRA during a feud between the two organisations. He was a longtime senior member of the Provisional IRA and served as the organisation's Quartermaster General, with oversight of their arms caches. He quit the organisation in protest at the movement's ceasefires and its participation through Sinn F√©in in the Northern Ireland peace process which led to the Good Friday Agreement. Real IRA activity McKevitt launched a dissident offshoot of the PIRA called the Real IRA, using seized PIRA weaponry. McKevitt was expelled from the Real IRA after a disagreement between a group of Real IRA prisoners in Portlaoise Prison and the outside leadership. The prisoners issued a statement urging the leadership to stand down claiming a criminal element had taken over.Text of 'real' Irish Republican Army (rIRA) Statement, 20 October 2002 CAIN (University of Ulster) McKevitt and his supporters went on to form a group called the New Republican Forum.New Republican Forum = Omagh Bombing = In June 2009, McKevitt was one of four men found by a civil court to be liable for the 1998 Omagh bombing in a case taken by relatives of the victims. In April 2014, The Telegraph revealed that McKevitt, along with Liam Campbell, were appealing the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights, citing their inability to cross-examine testimony of FBI source David Rupert as a violation of their right to a fair trial.  Arrests, convictions, and appeals  McKevitt was convicted by the Republic of Ireland's non-jury Special Criminal Court on 6 August 2003 of two terrorist offences: \\"membership of an illegal organisation\\" (the Real IRA) and \\"directing terrorism\\" between 29 August 1999 and 23 October 2000. On 7 August 2003 he was sentenced to twenty years in prison. During his trial Mr Justice Richard Johnson said of McKevitt, \\"The accused played a leading role in the organisation (Real IRA) which he directed and induced others to join.\\" Given all possible reductions and remission, it means that the earliest he could have been released was 2016. The prosecution's case was based largely on the testimony of an American FBI informant, David Rupert. According to information revealed in his trial, among his plans was to attempt the assassination of the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair. McKevitt appealed against his convictions to the Court of Criminal Appeal, arguing that Rupert's testimony was unreliable since he had been paid large sums of money for his role as an informant (a total of ¬£750,000 from the FBI and MI5), and because of Rupert's long criminal record. In December 2005, the court rejected these arguments and said that Rupert was a credible witness. Both of McKevitt's convictions were upheld. In July 2006, McKevitt was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The appeal was rejected on 30 July 2008. In February 2014, The Irish Court of Criminal Appeal heard a petition from McKevitt arguing that he should receive a new appeal based on an Irish Supreme Court decision in 2012 which ruled an unrelated Garda search of a suspect's home illegal. On 20 May 2014, the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal rejected McKevitt's bid to have his new appeal heard by the Supreme Court. In August 2014, McKevitt petitioned for release on the on grounds that, per Rule 59 (2) of Irish prison rules, McKevitt has not been given proper consideration by prison authorities for a one third remission of sentence taking into account model inmate behavior, due to his conviction being under the Offences Against the State Act. On 1 September 2014, McKevitt withdrew his appeal and was granted release to prepare a new challenge based on judicial review. On 9 December 2014 his challenge was struck down by Dublin's High Court.  Release  In March 2015, McKevitt was granted temporary release in order to treat a cancerous growth on his kidney. Subsequently, McKevitt underwent surgery to have the affected kidney surgically removed in May of the same year. On Easter Sunday 2016, McKevitt was formally released from prison upon the completion of his sentence.  Personal life McKevitt is married to Bernadette Sands McKevitt, a sister of 1981 PIRA hunger striker and MP, Bobby Sands, who died during his hunger strike. Sands McKevitt was a leading member of the 32 County Sovereignty Movement and had been described in media reports as the third highest ranking Real IRA officer. She left the 32 County Sovereignty Movement following the imprisonment of her husband.

This is a limited form of life insurance which is generally less expensive, or in some cases is an added benefit to an existing life insurance policy. Accidental death In the event of an accidental death, this insurance will pay benefits in addition to any life insurance but only up to a set amount total regardless of any other insurance held by same insurer, held by the client. This is called double indemnity coverage and is often available even when accidental death insurance is merely an add-on to a regular life insurance plan. Some of the covered accidents include traffic accidents, exposure, homicide, falls, heavy equipment accidents and drowning. Accidental deaths are the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S.Accidents or Unintentional Injuries by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accessed July 14, 2011. as well as in Canada. Accidental death insurance is not an investment vehicle and thus clients are paying only for sustained protection. Most policies have to be renewed periodically (with revised terms), although the client's consent with renewal is often implicitly assumed. =Common exclusions= Every insurer maintains a list of events and circumstances that void the insured's entitlement to his or her accidental death benefit. Death by illness, suicide, non-commercial aviation, war injury, and natural causes are generally not covered by AD&D.; Similarly, death while under the influence of any non- prescribed drugs or alcohol is most likely exempt from coverage. Overdose with toxic or poisonous substances and injury of an athlete during a professional sporting event may void the right to claim too. Some insurance carriers will tailor their clients' coverage to include some of the above risks, but every such extension will be accompanied by increased premiums. Due to these restrictions, the process of claiming the benefit may be relatively lengthy; the deceased client may have to undergo autopsy and the accident may have to be officially investigated before a claim is approved by the insurer. Dismemberment Fractional amounts of the policy will be paid out if the covered employee loses a bodily appendage or sight because of an accident.Margaret E. Lynch, Editor, \\"Health Insurance Terminology,\\" Health Insurance Association of America, 1992, Additionally, AD&D; generally pays benefits for the loss of limbs, fingers, toes, sight and permanent paralysis. The types of injuries covered and the amount paid vary by insurer and package, and are explicitly enumerated in the insurance policy. Coverage types There are four common types of group AD&D; plans offered in the United States: # Group Life Supplement ‚Äì the AD&D; benefit is included as part of a group life insurance contract, and the benefit amount is usually the same as that of the group life benefit. # Voluntary ‚Äì the AD&D; benefit is offered to members of a group. An example is an AD&D; policy provided in an initial nominal amount with premiums paid by another party (such as a small $1,000 AD&D; policy offered to credit union members, with the premium paid for by the credit union itself), with higher elective benefits offered to members where the member must pay the additional premiums separately. # Travel Accident (Business Trip) ‚Äì the AD&D; benefit is provided through an employee benefit plan and provides supplemental accident protection to workers while they are traveling on company business (the entire premium is usually paid by the employer). # Dependents ‚Äì Some group AD&D; plans also provide coverage for dependents.Fundamentals of Health Insurance: Part A, Health Insurance Association of America, 1997, See also * Bureau of Labor Statistics * Life insurance * Term life insurance * Permanent life insurance * Health insurance Health care  References  Health insurance Employee benefits ","title":"Accidental death and dismemberment insurance"},{"id":"290357","text":"Christopher Bram (born 1952) is an American author.

He moved to New York City in 1978. His nine novels range in subject matter from gay life in the 1970s to the career of a Victorian musical clairvoyant to the frantic world of theater people in contemporary New York. Fellow novelist Philip Gambone wrote of his work, \\"What is most impressive in Bram's fiction is the psychological and emotional accuracy with which he portrays his characters ... His novels are about ordinary gay people trying to be decent and good in a morally compromised world. He focuses on the often conflicting claims of friendship, family, love and desire; the ways good intentions can become confused and thwarted; and the ways we learn to be vulnerable and human.\\" Bram has written numerous articles and essays (a selection is included in Mapping the Territory). He has also written or co-written several screenplays, including feature documentary and short narrative films directed by his partner, Draper Shreeve. His 1995 novel Father of Frankenstein, about film director James Whale, was made into the 1998 movie Gods and Monsters starring Ian McKellen, Lynn Redgrave, and Brendan Fraser.

The sole species, Lodoicea maldivica, is endemic to the islands of Praslin and Curieuse in the Seychelles. It formerly also was found on the small islets of St Pierre, Chauve-Souris and Ile Ronde (Round Island), all located near Praslin, but had become extinct there for a time until recently reintroduced. The name of the genus, Lodoicea, may be derived from Lodoicus, the Latinised form of Louis, in honour of King Louis XV of France. Other sources say that Lodoicea is from Laodice, the daughter of Priam and Hecuba.

The male flowers are arranged in a catkin-like inflorescence up to 1 m long which continues to produce pollen over a ten-year period; one of the longest living inflorescences known. The mature fruit is 40‚Äì50 cm in diameter and weighs 15‚Äì30 kg, and contains the largest seed in the plant kingdom. The fruit, which requires 6‚Äì7 years to mature and a further two years to germinate, is sometimes also referred to as the sea coconut, love nut, double coconut, coco fesse, or Seychelles nut. While the functional characteristics of Lodoicea are similar to other trees of monodominant forests in the humid tropics, its unique features include a huge seed, effective funnelling mechanism and diverse community of closely associated animals. These attributes suggest a long evolutionary history under relatively stable conditions. Of the six monospecific endemic palms in Seychelles, Lodoicea is the \\"only true case of island gigantism among Seychelles flowering plants, a unique feature of Seychelles vegetation\\". It holds five botanical records: It produces the largest wild fruit so far recorded, weighing up to 42 kg,(although domesticated pumpkins and watermelons can be much heavier); the mature seeds weighing up to 17.6 kg are the world's heaviest, The seed upon germinating, produces the longest known cotyledon, up to four meters (13 feet). The female flowers are the largest of any palm. and Lodoicea is the most efficient plant known at recovering nutrients from moribund leaves.Science News (May 16, 2015) p.5.https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26930-the-secret-of-the-worlds- largest-seed-revealed/ Of the six endemic palms it is the only dioecious species, with male and female flowers located on different plants.Edwards, Kollmann & Fleischmann's selective review of the biology of the species (2002) =Habit= Lodoicea is robust, solitary, up to 30 m tall with an erect, spineless, stem which is ringed with leaf scars (Calstrom, unpublished). The base of the trunk is of a bulbous form and this bulb fits into a natural bowl, or socket, about 2.5 ft in diameter and 18 inches in depth, narrowing towards the bottom. This bowl is pierced with hundreds of small oval holes about the size of a thimble with hollow tubes corresponding on the outside through which the roots penetrate the ground on all sides, never, however, becoming attached to the bowl; they are partially elastic, affording an almost imperceptible but very necessary \\"play\\" to the parent stem when struggling against the force of violent gales. =Leaves= The crown is a rather dense head of foliage with leaves that are stiff, palmate up to 10 m in diameter and petioles of two to four metres in length. The leaf is plicate at the base, cut one third or more into segments 4‚Äì10 cm broad with bifid end which are often drooping. A triangular cleft develops at the petiole base. The palm leaves form a huge funnel that intercepts particulate material, especially pollen, which is flushed to the base of the trunk when it rains. In this way, Lodoicea improves its nutrient supply and that of its dispersal-limited offspring. =Flowers= Two endemic species on Koko De Mer in Vall√©e De Mai (March 2016) The clusters of staminate flowers are arranged spirally and are flanked by very tough leathery bracts. Each has a small bracteole, three sepals forming a cylindrical tube, and a three-lobed corolla. There are 17 to 22 stamens. The pistillate flowers are solitary and borne at the angles of the rachis and are partially sunken in it in the form of a cup. They are ovoid with three petals as well as three sepals. It has been suggested that they may be pollinated by animals such as the endemic lizards which inhabit the forest where they occur.Beaver and Chong Seng, 1992 Pollination by wind and rain are also thought to be important. Only when Lodoicea begins to produce flowers, which can vary from 11 years to 45 or more, is it possible to visually determine the sex of the plant. The nectar and pollen are also food for several endemic animals e.g. bright green geckos (Phelsuma sp.), white slugs (Vaginula seychellensis) and insects. =Inflorescence= Male inflorescence Inflorescences are interfoliar, lacking a covering spathe and shorter than the leaves. The staminate inflorescence is catkin-like, one to two metres long and generally terminal and solitary, sometimes two or three catkins may be present. The pistillate inflorescences are also one to two metres long unbranched and the flowers are borne on a zig-zagging rachilla. =Fruit= Fruit The fruit is bilobed, flattened, 40 to 50 cm long ovoid and pointed, and contains usually one but occasionally two to four seeds. The epicarp is smooth and the mesocarp is fibrous. The endosperm is thick, relatively hard, hollow and homogenous. The embryo sits in the sinus between the two lobes. During germination a tubular cotyledonary petiole develops that connects the young plant to the seed. The length of the tube is reported to reach about four metres. In the Vallee de Mai the tube may be up to 10 m long. Lodoicea was once believed to be a sea-bean or drift seed, a seed evolved to be dispersed by the sea. However, it is now known that the viable nut is too dense to float, and only rotted out nuts can be found on the sea surface,Adam Leith Gollner, The Fruit Hunters, a story of nature, adventure, commerce and obsession, page 114. Scribner 1999, thus explaining why the trees are limited in range to just two islands. Habitat Lodoicea inhabit rainforests where there are deep, well-drained soils and open exposed slopes; although growth is reduced on such eroded soils. History and mythology Tree in a Sri Lanka botanic garden Formerly Lodoicea was known as Maldive coconut. Its scientific name, Lodoicea maldivica, originated before the 18th century when the Seychelles were uninhabited. In centuries past the coconuts that fell from the trees and ended up in the sea would be carried away eastwards by the prevailing sea currents. The nuts can only float after the germination process, when they are hollow. In this way many drifted to the Maldives where they were gathered from the beaches and valued as an important trade and medicinal item.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. Barcelona 1999, This association is reflected in one of the plant's archaic botanical names, Lodoicea callipyge Comm. ex J. St.-Hil., in which callipyge is from Greek words meaning 'beautiful buttocks'. Other botanical names used in the past include Lodoicea sechellarum Labill. and Lodoicea sonneratii (Giseke) Baill. Until the true source of the nut was discovered in 1768 by Dufresne, it was believed by many to grow on a mythical tree at the bottom of the sea. European nobles in the sixteenth century would often have the shells of these nuts polished and decorated with valuable jewels as collectibles for their private galleries. The coco de mer tree is now a rare and protected species. Uses The species is grown as an ornamental tree in many areas in the tropics, and subsidiary populations have been established on Mah√© and Silhouette Islands in the Seychelles to help conserve the species. The fruit is used in Siddha medicine, Ayurvedic medicine and also in traditional Chinese medicine. In food, it is typically found as flavor enhancers for soups in southern Chinese cuisine, such as that of Guangdong Province. The seeds of Lodoicea have been highly prized over the centuries; their rarity caused great interest and high prices in royal courts, and the tough outer seed coat has been used to make bowls such as for Sufi/Dervish beggar-alms kashkul bowls and other instruments. Taxonomy Lodoicea belongs to the Coryphoidae subfamily and tribe Borasseae. Borasseae is represented by four genera in Madagascar and one in Seychelles out of the seven worldwide. They are distributed on the coastlands surrounding the Indian ocean and the existing islands within. Borassus, the genus closest to Lodoicea, has about five species in the \\"old world,\\" one species in Africa, one in India, South-East Asia and Malaysia, one in New Guinea and two species in Madagascar.Uhl and Dransfield, 1987. Threats The history of exploitation continues today, and the collection of nuts has virtually stopped all natural regeneration of populations with the exception of the introduced population on Silhouette. This palm has been lost from the wild from three Seychelles islands within its former range. Habitat loss is one of the major threats to the survival of remaining populations, there have been numerous fires on the islands of Praslin and Curieuse, and only immature trees remain over large parts of these islands. Conservation The Seychelles is a World Heritage Site, and a third of the area is now protected. The main populations of Lodoicea are found within the Praslin and Curieuse National Parks, and the trade in nuts is controlled by the Coco-de-mer (Management) Decree of 1995. Firebreaks also exist at key sites in an effort to prevent devastating fires from sweeping through populations. Cultivated palms are grown on a number of other islands and are widely present in botanic gardens; although the collection of seeds in order to recruit these populations may be a further threat to the remaining natural stands. Conservation priorities are the continued protection of populations, enforcement of regulations and effective fire control. In India, the species is extinct in the wild. The only known specimen is in the Botanical Garden of Kolkata, maintained by Botanical Survey of India. It was successfully artificially pollinated.

This cafe's dining area, two stories below the Arcosanti Visitors' Center and Gallery. Arcosanti is a projected experimental town with a molten bronze bell casting business in Yavapai County, central Arizona, 70 mi (110 km) north of Phoenix, at an elevation of 3,732 feet (1,130 meters). Its arcology concept was proposed by the Italian-American architect Paolo Soleri (1919‚Äì2013). He began construction in 1970, to demonstrate how urban conditions could be improved while minimizing the destructive impact on the earth. He taught and influenced generations of architects and urban designers who studied and worked with him there to build the proposed \\"town\\".  Overview  The goal of Arcosanti is to explore the concept of arcology, which combines architecture and ecology. The project has the goals of combining the social interaction and accessibility of an urban environment with sound environmental principles, such as minimal resource use and access to the natural environment. The project has been building an experimental town on 25 acres (10 ha) of a 4,060-acre (1,640 ha) land preserve. The Arcosanti apse Ground was broken in 1970 to begin construction on the site, and has continued at a varying pace through the present. The most recently completed building was finished in 1989. The population has tended to vary between 50 and 150 people, many of them students and volunteers. The goal was for Arcosanti to house a population of 5,000 people. Thirteen major structures were built on the site, some several stories tall. One master plan, designed in 2001, envisioned a massive complex, called \\"Arcosanti 5000\\", that would dwarf the current buildings. Many features are particular to the design and construction of Arcosanti. For example, tilt-up concrete panels are cast in a bed of silt acquired from the surrounding area, giving the concrete a unique texture and color that helps it blend with the landscape. Many panels were cast with embedded art. Most buildings are oriented southward to capture the sun's light and heat ‚Äì roof designs admit the maximum amount of sunlight in the winter and a minimal amount during the summer. The structure built to shelter bronze-casting is built in the form of an apse, a quarter-sphere or semi-dome. The layout of all the buildings is intricate and organic, rather than the grid typical of most US cities, with the goals of maximum accessibility to all elements, a combination of increased social interaction and bonds, together with privacy for the residents. Existing structures at Arcosanti are meant to begin to provide for the complete needs of a community. They include: a five-story visitors' center/cafe/gift shop; a bronze-casting apse; a ceramics apse; two large barrel vaults; a ring of apartment residences and quasi-public spaces around an outdoor amphitheater; a community swimming pool; an office complex, above which is an apartment that was originally Soleri's suite. A two-bedroom \\"Sky Suite\\" occupies the highest point in the complex; it, as well as a set of rooms below the pool, is available for overnight guests. Most of the buildings have accessible roofs. Visitors' center and residence Arcosanti has a Camp area, built by and for the original construction crew. It is used today as housing for approximately 1/4 of the Arcosanti population. Camp has a small greenhouse, with easy access to gardens and large agricultural fields that, as of March 2017, were not being cultivated. Terraced greenhouses are planned along the slope of the main building site for winter plant and garden space, and to collect heat to distribute through the buildings. Arcosanti was conceived of and remains primarily an education center, with students from around the world visiting to attend workshops, classes, and to assist with the continuing construction. 40,000 tourists visit yearly.Urban design by Jon T. Lang, page 126, Google Books Tourists can take a guided tour of the site or make reservations to stay overnight in guest accommodations. Some Arcosanti funding comes from selling the bells made and cast from clay and bronze on site. Additional funding comes from donations, and fees for workshops. Much of the present construction at Arcosanti has been done by workshop participants and volunteers. The average salary at Arcosanti for much of its history was barely above minimum wage.  Workshops  Starting in 1970, participants have come to help build Arcosanti by enrolling in workshops. During the traditional five- or six-week workshop, they attend lectures about Paolo Soleri and the principles of Arcology design while gaining hands-on learning experience by aiding construction. Although the program attracts many who are interested in art, crafts, architecture and urban planning, it is also pertinent to those interested in philosophy, sociology, science, and agriculture. Today, workshops are shorter in duration, one week or less, and focus on the learning, including experiential learning.

Their first official activities began there in 1959. * 1969: Arcosanti ‚Äì Soleri coined the term \\"Arcology\\" to describe his designs for ecologically sound human habitats, as elaborated in The City in the Image of Man, published by MIT Press to accompany a so-titled 1970 exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC. The book develops the concept of Arcology and its design variations for different settings. Arcosanti, introduced as the last (30th) example of this exercise, was originally planned to house a relatively small population of 1,500 people. The physical construction of Arcosanti began in 1970. * 1975‚Äì1977: Two Suns Arcosanti ‚Äì The Xerox Corporation sponsored a major Soleri exhibition, featuring a series of new arcology designs that suggested a sustainable urban habitat employing alternative energy sources. The project was called Two Suns Arcology: The Cities Energized by the Sun. The Arcosanti master plan went through a major overhaul reflecting this methodology. In the following year, Plant Show venues gave Soleri additional funding to update the Arcosanti design. The projected population was increased to 5,000. * 1978: During a festival held at the site, a grass fire ignited in the area being used as a parking lot and over 180 cars were damaged or destroyed.\\"Arcosanti '78: Music Under Fire\\" , The AZEdge, 20 October 2011Google News Archive The Prescott Courier, 12 September 1979\\"Arcosanti car fire photograph\\", Flickr thumb * 1980: Critical Mass ‚Äì Ten years into the construction of the first prototype arcology, a developmental adjustment was made to gain momentum for the project. The Critical Mass concept was introduced as an incremental phase to house 10 percent of the projected population of 5,000. A series of small- scale structures, providing various amenities, were designed to support a viable community. This was intended to support the next major step, the completion of Arcosanti. * 1988: Nightfall ‚Äì The science fiction film Nightfall was filmed at Arcosanti. Residents served as extras. * 2001: Arcosanti 5000 ‚Äì Developed from the Super Critical Mass in \\"Arcosanti 2000\\", with the design elements of \\"Nudging Space Arcology\\" added, Arcosanti 5000 features seven phases of truncated super-apse structures. It re-establishes the macro nature of this prototype arcology for 5,000 people. This design is in development, awaiting architectural and structural resolutions. * 2009: Paolo Soleri's 90th Birthday Celebration and Alumni Reunion ‚Äì Paolo Soleri celebrated his 90th birthday at Arcosanti, joined by 300 alumni and guests for the occasion. The official schedule started on June 19; this first day was devoted to alumni. Ongoing events included Kundalini yoga, a morning bell- carving workshop, a silent auction, and an exhibition with the newest renderings of Critical Mass. The festivities continued into the night with a bronze pour in the Foundry, followed by a techno party in the Vaults, and performances on a stage in the Ceramics Apse.\\"Paolo's 90th Bronze Pour\\" Arcosanti Daily Progress Report The birthday celebration for Soleri resumed on Saturday with attendees partaking in a gargantuan \\"frugal soup\\" gathering in the Vaults.Paolo's 90th Frugal Soup Arcosanti Daily Progress Report Documentary film maker Geoffrey Madeja presented a short video. Tomiaki Tamura followed with a visual presentation of Paolo's life and work and a pictograph especially choreographed for Paolo.

Stein's proposals for Arcosanti began with: a half- dozen new apartment buildings; a canopy for the amphitheater; a renovated commercial bakery; and a storage unit for Paolo Soleri's collection of architectural models. thumb Arcosanti operates under aegis of the Cosanti Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. The Foundation runs workshops to teach Paolo Soleri's ideas. As of 2012, more than 7,000 participants had aided in the construction through participation in five-week workshops.\\"5 week workshop\\", Arcosanti.org Each workshop includes a Seminar Week, which covers Soleri's background and history, as well as his concepts about arcology design. They hear lectures from different departments at Arcosanti to see how Arcosanti operates, and then spend the following weeks working at the priority project of the site. Arcosanti is the home of the bell-making enterprise of Cosanti Originals, which sells Soleri's sculptural wind bells to support the greater architectural project.  Documentary  Over six years in the making, the (2013) feature-length documentary film on the life of Paolo Soleri and the birth of Arcosanti, The Vision of Paolo Soleri: Prophet in the Desert (2012) features on-camera interviews with journalist Morley Safer, Will Wright, architectural critic Paul Goldberger, Catherine Hardwicke, Will Bruder, Jean- Michel Cousteau, architect Steven Holl, and Eric Lloyd Wright.

In 1973, Cowpland and Terry Matthews founded Mitel Corporation, a company that developed and sold electronic PBX systems. Initial success made both founders millionaires. Sales peaked at $250 million, but over-expansion and development problems saw the company bought by British Telecom. Both Cowpland and Matthews left the company in 1984 amid disagreements with the owners. =Corel= Matthews went on to found Newbridge Networks, while Cowpland launched Cowpland Research Laboratory (soon Corel) in Ottawa in 1985. At first, the company sold DTP workstations, but success did not arrive until the launch of the graphics software CorelDRAW in 1989. In 1996, he offered a challenge to Microsoft with a move into productivity software, acquiring WordPerfect from Novell for $158 million. However this was unsuccessful as Microsoft managed to get many new computers loaded with Microsoft Word along with Windows. The company also made unsuccessful forays into CAD, videoconferencing, Java, Linux and other developments. He was investigated by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) in 1999‚Äì2000 regarding allegations that he had used insider information to sell $20 million in Corel shares at $8/share shortly before the company posted disappointing results. The two sides settled the case in 2003, with Cowpland agreeing to pay $575,000. Subsequent to Cowpland's alleged insider sale at $8, Corel shares hit a peak of $60/share around November 1999, during the height of the Linux boom when Corel's Desktop Linux was seen to be a potential rival to Microsoft Windows. After an unsuccessful attempt to buy Borland with a view to creating a critical mass for Linux, Cowpland left Corel in August 2000, and moved on to buy control of ZIM corporation, a database and mobile content company which is listed on the NASDAQ bulletin board (ZIMCF).

Youth for Christ is a worldwide Christian movement working with young people around the globe. The main purpose for the organization is evangelism, missionary work targeting young people. History of Youth for Christ Advertisement for Youth for Christ's 3-day campaign in Stockholm in April 1946. Following World War II, some Protestant evangelists began ministering to the youth of America and especially the younger members of the U.S. Armed Forces. These formerly unaffiliated activities became collectively known as \\"Youth for Christ\\" campaigns and were inspired by the work of Jack Wyrtzen in New York City during the 1940s. Wyrtzen was a young ex-insurance salesman who had also played the trombone in a cavalry band. The Youth for Christ campaign idea spread to Washington, D.C., Detroit, Indianapolis and St. Louis. In 1944 Torrey Johnson, a Baptist minister and pastor of Chicago's Midwest Bible Church, staged \\"Chicagoland for Christ\\" and became the most successful advocate of this type of campaign. In 1944 Chicago pastor Torrey Johnson was elected Youth for Christ's first president, with Billy Graham as its first full-time evangelist. =The 1950s= By 1950, Youth for Christ was already an international movement with Youth for Christ springing up in cities around the globe. =The 1960s= In 1968, in a little publicized conference in Jamaica, representatives from different countries created the International Council of Youth for Christ with Dr. Sam Wolgemuth as the first International President. The number of nations with Youth for Christ ministry had grown to over 100. =The 1970s and 1980s= Youth for Christ continued its growth throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Different ministry models and ministry emphases were developed and refined to reach young people around the world. During this time the current Youth for Christ logo was launched and adopted by the global organization. =The 1990s= In 1996 a report was presented to the Youth for Christ movement in Taiwan, with recommendations for a restructuring of the organisation. =2000s= In March 2000 the Youth for Christ organisation met in Muhltal, Germany. Most of the leadership, including the International Board, attended the gathering. The Youth for Christ worldwide Staff and Leadership Conference (General Assembly) was held in Denver, Colorado later that year. The Global Ministry Plan In 2002, leadership teams worldwide again met in Hungary to further explore how various Youth for Christ entities could unite behind a global ministry initiative. After a week of deliberation and consultation, the participants developed the framework of what later became the Global Ministry Plan. Between 2002 and 2003, The Global Ministry Plan was communicated and discussed throughout the Youth for Christ movement. After consultations with most of the Youth for Christ chartered nations, the Global Ministry Plan was unanimously approved by the General Assembly at a gathering of the worldwide Youth for Christ family in Belo Horizonte, Brazil September 2003. At the Belo Horizonte General Assembly a new strategic focus statement was also adopted which is foundational to the Global Ministry Plan: Youth for Christ reaches young people everywhere, working together with the local church and other like-minded partners to raise up lifelong followers of Jesus who lead by their godliness in lifestyle, devotion to the Word of God and prayer, passion for sharing the love of Christ and commitment to social involvement. The British branch is now a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, by virtue of its work for the personal and social development of young people. =2008 General Assembly ‚Äì Young Leader's Process= In September 2008 the Youth for Christ worldwide family gathered in Magaliesburg, South Africa for the General Assembly. This was special event as over 350 young leaders from around the world joined the staff and a new initiative was launched: The Young Leader Development and Empowerment Process. Formation of Youth for Christ International In 1945 Charles Templeton of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and Torrey Johnson met with a number of youth leaders from around the United States at Winona Lake, Indiana. Their agenda was to form a working group that would become an organization known as \\"Youth for Christ International\\" which was born in 1946. Torrey Johnson was elected as its first president. Popular youth events such as Bible quizzing, which is now embraced by many Christian denominations, were originally begun as Youth for Christ activities. =Billy Graham's evangelistic beginnings= Evangelist Billy Graham was the first full-time evangelist of YFCI. Graham took over Johnson's local radio program called Songs in the Night which was broadcast over a local station in Illinois and predated YFCI. Later still Graham left YFCI to form his own evangelistic association and commence the Hour of Decision broadcast. =Promotion by William Randolph Hearst= Success for YFCI came from the promotional publicity in the newspapers and magazines owned or influenced by William Randolph Hearst. Due to the publicity by Hearst during a Los Angeles campaign, Billy Graham suddenly became a media star. By 1946 Youth for Christ International had approximately 300 units in the United States and over 200 overseas. The average attendance at rallies in 1946 was 350. The largest attendance at that time was 70,000 at Soldier's Field in Chicago. Staff =Current President of Youth For Christ USA= Dan Wolgemuth, a 1977 Taylor University graduate, is the current president of Youth For Christ USA. =Current International President= Dave Brereton is the current International Director of Youth for Christ.

Officially named Prisoner of War Temporary Enclosures (PWTE), they held between one and almost two million surrendered Wehrmacht personnel from April until September 1945. Prisoners held in the camps were designated disarmed enemy forces, not prisoners of war. This decision was made in March 1945 by SHAEF commander in chief Dwight D. Eisenhower: by not classifying the hundreds of thousands of captured troops as POWs, the logistical problems associated with accommodating so many prisoners of war mandated by the Geneva Convention governing their treatment were negated. Most estimates of German deaths in these camps range from 3,000 to 6,000. Many of these died from starvation, dehydration and exposure to the weather elements because no structures were built inside the prison compounds. Background By early 1945 half of almost all German soldiers taken prisoner in the West were held by U.S. forces, while the other half were taken by the British. But in late March 1945, as Allied forces struck into the heart of Germany after crossing the Rhine at Remagen, the number of German prisoners being processed caused the British to stop accepting any more prisoners into their camps. This forced the U.S. Army to take immediate action and establish the Rheinwiesenlager in the western part of Germany. The creation of the camps was made easier because prisoners would be deemed as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), a decision that had been made in March 1945 by Eisenhower. Furthermore, all captured soldiers would no longer have the rights of prisoners of war guaranteed to them under the Geneva Convention because they belonged to Nazi Germany, a state that had ceased to exist. The camps were also established to stop any German insurgency following the surrender of Nazi Germany on 8 May 1945. The Allied leadership were worried that die-hard Nazi units might try to mount an effective guerrilla campaign against the occupation. Historian Perry Biddiscombe believed the decision to keep hundreds of thousands of men in poor conditions of the Rheinwiesenlager camps was \\"mainly to prevent Werwolf activity\\" in post-war Germany.Biddiscombe, Alexander Perry, (1998).

After the failure of the Ardennes offensive, 250,000 German soldiers surrendered. After the breakdown of the Ruhr pocket another 325,000 were taken prisoner. After capitulation there were 3.4 million German soldiers in the custody of the Western Allies. With such large numbers of prisoners, it seemed more logical to keep them in Germany. The camps were founded in April 1945 and remained in existence until September. There was a similar plan for the construction of all the camps. Open farmland close to a village with a railroad line was enclosed with barbed wire and divided into 10 to 20 camps, each housing 5,000 to 10,000 men. Existing field paths were used as streets of the camp and surrounding buildings as the administration, kitchen and hospital.MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES ARMY PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN WORLD WAR II, Volume IX, SPECIAL FIELDS, Prepared and published under the direction of Lieutenant General LEONARD D.

Later, some canvas was provided, and still later, some buildings were put up. For most of the time, prisoners were without cover and were exposed to rain and snow and mud in the ending winter, and to heat, dust, or rain and mud as spring advanced to early summer. Some of the enclosures resembled Andersonville Prison in 1864\\" The prisoners of war, forced to surrender their equipment, had to dig holes in the earth by hand in which to sleep. Soon the camps were grossly overcrowded; e.g., Camp Remagen, intended for 100,000, grew to 184,000 prisoners.MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES ARMY PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN WORLD WAR II, Volume IX, SPECIAL FIELDS, Prepared and published under the direction of Lieutenant General LEONARD D.

To circumvent international laws that dealt with the handling of POWs, the surrendered forces were termed \\"Disarmed Enemy Forces\\" (DEF) and the term \\"Prisoners of war\\" (POW) was not applied. Due to the numbers of prisoners, the Americans transferred internal control of the camps over to the Germans. All administration such as doctors, cooks and work forces was undertaken by the prisoners. Even the armed guards were former troops from the Wehrmacht's Feldgendarmerie and Feldj√§gerkorps. Known as Wehrmachtordnungstruppe (Armed Forces Order Troop), they received extra rations for preventing escapes and keeping order in the camps. In June 1946, these military police would be the last German soldiers to officially surrender their arms. Within weeks of the camps being established, some prisoner releases were started. First to be allowed to leave were members of the Hitlerjugend and female personnel who were deemed to have no affiliation with the Nazi Party. Professional groups, such as farmers, drivers and miners, soon followed because they were urgently required to assist in the reconstruction of German infrastructure. By the end of June 1945, the camps at Remagen, B√∂hl-Iggelheim and B√ºderich had been emptied. On 12 June 1945, the British forces took control of the two Rheinwiesenlager camps designated to be in the British Zone. On 10 July 1945, all releases were halted after SHAEF handed control of the camps over to the French. The deal was struck because the government of Charles de Gaulle wanted 1.75 million prisoners of war for forced labor in France. In total roughly 182,400 prisoners from Sinzig, Andernach, Siershahn, Bretzenheim, Dietersheim, Koblenz, Hechtzheim and Dietz were given to France.Erhard K√∂stler, Franz Grohmann, Rudolf Bentzinger \\"Heckenrosen: Tageb√ºcher aus Krieg und Gefangenschaft in Frankreich, November 1944 bis Oktober 1948\\" p.379 Dr. Bachmaier Verlag, 2003 The British handed over those fit for work from the two camps it controlled at B√ºderich and Rheinberg and released the remainder. By the end of September 1945 nearly all the Rheinwiesenlager camps had been closed. Only a camp at Bretzenheim near Bad Kreuznach remained open until 1948, serving as a transit camp for German prisoners released from France.  Conditions and death rates  Women prisoners held in the Third U.S. Army enclosure at Regensburg, Germany, 8 May 1945. The exposed conditions within Sinzig POW camp, 16 May 1945. Throughout the summer of 1945, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was prevented from visiting prisoners in any of the Allies' Rheinwiesenlager. Visits were only started in the autumn of 1945, at a time when most camps had closed or were closing. The Red Cross was granted permission to send delegations to visit camps in the French and UK occupation zones. On 4 February 1946 the Red Cross was allowed to send relief to those in the U.S. run occupation zone. The International Red Cross website states \\"The quantities received by the ICRC for these captives remained very small, however. During their visits, the delegates observed that German prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded in getting some improvements made.\\"ICRC in WW II: German prisoners of war in Allied hands Official United States statistics conclude there were just over 3,000 deaths in the Rheinwiesenlager while German figures state them to be 4,537. American academic R. J. Rummel believes the figure is around 6,000.R.J. Rummel STATISTICS OF DEMOCIDE: Chapter 13: Death By American Bombing And Other Democide Canadian writer James Bacque claimed in his 1989 book Other Losses that the number is likely in the hundreds of thousands, and may be has high as 1,000,000.James Bacque Other Losses: An Investigation into the Mass Deaths of German Prisoners at the Hands of the French and Americans After World War II, Toronto: Stoddard, 1989, p. 2 et passim But credible historians including Stephen Ambrose, Albert E. Cowdrey and R√ºdiger Overmans have examined and rejected Bacque's claims, arguing that they were the result of faulty research practices. More recently, writing in the Encyclopedia of Prisoners of War and Internment, military historian S.P. MacKenzie stated: \\"That German prisoners were treated very badly in the months immediately after the war [‚Ä¶] is beyond dispute. All in all, however, Bacque's thesis and mortality figures cannot be taken as accurate\\".S.P. Mackenzie in J. Vance, ed. The Encyclopedia of Internment and Prisoners of War, 294 In 1972, the official German inquiry into the numbers of deaths was published by the Maschke committee (named after its chairman, Erich Maschke). It had conducted detailed research of the camp histories on behalf of the Bundesministerium f√ºr Vertriebene, Fl√ºchtlinge und Kriegsgesch√§digte (German Federal Ministry of Displaced persons, Refugees, and War Victims). According to their results, the camps with the highest mortality were: # Bad Kreuznach (Lager Galgenberg und Bretzenheim) # Sinzig near Remagen # Rheinberg # Heidesheim # Wickrathberg # B√ºderich An analysis of the documents of the local administrations around the camps of Remagen yields similar results. The official death rate for Germans held by the American military was among the lowest experienced by surrendered combatants during and after the war, which is not surprising as the prisoners were held for only a few months.Ferguson, Niall, Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat, War in History, Vol. 11, 2004, Part 2, page 186 Postwar conclusions In 1969, Lieutenant General Leonard D. Heaton prepared and published an exhaustive report for the United States Army Medical Department that examined preventive medicine and the problems associated with housing such a large number of German prisoners after World War II. The report found a number of problems, including: *The army had lost track of some of the locations where POWs were held.MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES ARMY PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN WORLD WAR II, Volume IX, SPECIAL FIELDS, Prepared and published under the direction of Lieutenant General LEONARD D.

It was therefore decided to build a static system of defensive lines around Britain, designed to compartmentalise the country and delay the Germans long enough for more mobile forces to counter-attack. Over 50 defensive lines were constructed across the country. After the coastal defences, the GHQ Line was the longest and most important, designed to protect London and the industrial heart of Britain, and was considered to be the last chance of defence. The \\"green\\" section of the GHQ Line ran from the northern end of the Taunton Stop Line near Highbridge in Somerset, along the River Brue, across the Mendips from Wells and following the railway from Masbury into the Wellow valley. This joined the \\"blue\\" line which followed the Kennet and Avon Canal to Reading. The green line continued from Bradford-on-Avon along the river to Malmesbury where it met the \\"red\\" line which ran to Abingdon, along the Thames to Pangbourne and rejoined the blue line at Theale. The green line continued to Avening then down the valley to Framilode, protecting the strategic areas of Bristol, Avonmouth, and Sharpness. The eastern line was to run inland of the coast from Essex to Edinburgh but was not completed. London was protected by the concentric rings of the Outer London Defence Ring. On the section of the line in Essex, between Great Chesterford and Canvey Island, the defences were made up of around 400 FW3 type concrete pillboxes, which were part of the British hardened field defences of World War II. Well over 100 pillboxes still exist on this section in 2020, with around 40 highly visible FW3 Type 22, 24, 26, 27 and 28 boxes between the Rettendon Turnpike and Howe Green, mostly alongside the recently constructed A130. Many more FW3s are still in place north of Chelmsford along the Chelmer Valley and towards Great Dunmow.

He has been described as a \\"fascist intellectual\\",Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: a historical encyclopedia, vol 1. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 208. a \\"radical traditionalist\\", \\"antiegalitarian, antiliberal, antidemocratic, and antipopular\\",Atkins, Stephen E. Encyclopedia of modern worldwide extremists and extremist groups. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. p 89. and as having been \\"the leading philosopher of Europe's neofascist movement\\". Evola is popular in fringe circles, largely because of his metaphysical, magical, and supernatural beliefs - including belief in ghosts, telepathy, and alchemyHorrox, James. \\"Julius Evola\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 20 July 2011.and his traditionalism. He himself termed his philosophy \\"magical idealism\\". Many of Evola's theories and writings were centered on his hostility toward Christianity and his idiosyncratic mysticism, occultism, and esoteric religious studies, and this aspect of his work has influenced occultists and esotericists. Evola also justified male domination over women as part of a purely patriarchal society, an outlook stemming from his traditionalist views on gender, which demanded women stay in or revert to what he saw as their traditional gender roles, where they were completely subordinate to male authority. Joseph Gelfer, Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy, Routledge 2014 p.45:‚ÄôThe law is ‚Äúreciprocal integration and completion together with a subordination of the female principle to the male.‚Äù Everything else, as Nietzsche would say, is nonsense.' (citing Evola 1991:171) According to the scholar Franco Ferraresi, \\"Evola's thought can be considered one of the most radical and consistent anti-egalitarian, anti-liberal, anti-democratic, and anti-popular systems in the 20th century\\". It is a singular, though not necessarily original, blend of several schools and traditions, including German idealism, Eastern doctrines, traditionalism, and the all-embracing Weltanschauung of the interwar conservative revolutionary movement with which Evola had a deep personal involvement. Historian Aaron Gillette described Evola as \\"one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history\\". Evola admired SS head Heinrich Himmler, whom he once met. Autobiographical remarks by Evola allude to his having worked for the Sicherheitsdienst, or SD, the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party.Coogan, ibid pp.315-316H. T. Hansen, 'Preface to the American Edition‚Äô, in Julius Evola, Men Among the Ruins: Post-War Reflections of a Radical Traditionalist, Simon and Schuster, 2018 pp-1-104, p.5. This is deduced by remarks by Evola suggesting he was an active agent for the Sicherheitsdienst, remarks that Philippe Baillet, his French translator, believes refer to the fact that the Sicherheitsdienst had been set up within the SS and had a remit to cover cultural matters, before it actually assumed a later role in Nazi counterespionage. During his trial in 1951, Evola denied being a fascist and instead referred to himself as \\"\\" (). Concerning this statement, historian Elisabetta Cassina Wolff wrote that \\"It is unclear whether this meant that Evola was placing himself above or beyond Fascism\\". Evola has been called the \\"chief ideologue\\" of Italy's radical right after World War II. He continues to influence contemporary traditionalist and neo- fascist movements. Life Giulio Cesare Evola was born in Rome,Birth records of Rome for the year 1898, National Archives of Rome the son of Vincenzo Evola (born 1854)Birth records of Cinisi for the year 1854, National Archives of Palermo and Concetta Mangiapane (born 1865).Birth records of Cinisi for the year 1865, National Archives of Palermo Both his parents had been born in Cinisi, a small town in the Province of Palermo on the north-western coast of Sicily. The paternal grandparents of Giulio Cesare Evola were Giuseppe Evola and Maria Cusumano. Giuseppe Evola is reported as being a joiner in Vincenzo's birth record. The maternal grandparents of Giulio Cesare Evola were Cesare Mangiapane, reported as being a shopkeeper in Concetta's birth record, and his wife Caterina Munac√≥. Vincenzo Evola and Concetta Mangiapane were married in Cinisi on 25 November 1892.Marriage records of Cinisi for the year 1892, National Archives of Palermo Vincenzo Evola is reported as being a telegraphic mechanic chief, while Concetta Mangiapane is reported as being a landowner. Giulio Cesare Evola had an elder brother, Giuseppe Gaspare Dinamo Evola, born in 1895 in Rome,Birth records of Rome for the year 1895, National Archives of Rome Following a slight variation on the Sicilian naming convention of the era, as the second son, Giulio Cesare Evola was partly named after his maternal grandfather. Evola has been often been reported as being a baron, De Turris et al., Il Barone Immaginario, Ugo Mursia Editore, Milan, 2018 probably in reference to a purported distant relationship with a minor aristocratic family, the Evoli who were the barons of Castropignano in the Kingdom of Sicily in the late Middle Ages.Catalogus Baronum, number 788, p. 143 Little is known about Evola's early upbringing except that he considered it irrelevant. He studied engineering at the Istituto Tecnico Leonardo da Vinci in Rome, but did not complete his course, later claiming this was because he \\"did not want to be associated in any way with bourgeois academic recognition and titles such as doctor and engineer.\\"Paul Furlong, The Social and Political Thought of Julius Evola. London: Routledge, 2011. Julius Evola, Il Camino del Cinabro, 1963 In his teenage years, Evola immersed himself in painting‚Äîwhich he considered one of his natural talents‚Äîand literature, including Oscar Wilde and Gabriele d'Annunzio. He was introduced to philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Otto Weininger. Other early philosophical influences included Carlo Michelstaedter and Max Stirner.Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Post-war fascisms. Taylor & Francis, 2004. p. 219 In the First World War Evola served as an artillery officer on the Asiago plateau. He was attracted to the avant-garde, and after the war he briefly associated with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Futurist movement. Through his painting and poetry, and through work on the short-lived journal Revue Bleue, he became a prominent representative of Dadaism in Italy. In 1922, after concluding that avant-garde art was becoming commercialized and stiffened by academic conventions, he reduced his focus on artistic expression such as painting and poetry. Evola was arrested in April 1951 by the Political Office of the Rome Police Headquarters and charged on suspicion that he was an ideologist of the militant neofascist organization Fasci di Azione Rivoluzionaria (FAR). Evola was defended by Prof. Francesco Carnelutti. On November 20, 1951, Evola was acquitted of all charges.\\"Evola al processo ai F.A.R.\\" Evola died on 11 June 1974 in Rome from congestive heart failure. Writing career =Christianity= In 1928, Evola wrote an attack on Christianity titled Pagan Imperialism, which proposed transforming fascism into a system consistent with ancient Roman values and Western esotericism. Evola proposed that fascism should be a vehicle for reinstating the caste system and aristocracy of antiquity. Although he invoked the term \\"fascism\\" in this text, his diatribe against the Catholic Church was criticized by both Mussolini's fascist regime and the Vatican itself. A. James Gregor argued that the text was an attack on fascism as it stood at the time of writing, but noted that Mussolini made use of it to threaten the Vatican with the possibility of an \\"anti-clerical fascism\\". On account of Evola's anti-Christian proposals, in April 1928 the Vatican-backed right wing Catholic journal Revue Internationale des Soci√©t√©s Secr√®tes published an article entitled \\"Un Sataniste Italien: Julius Evola\\", accusing him of satanism.A. Tarannes, Un sataniste italien, J. Evola, in ¬´Revue Internationale des Soci√®t√®s Secr√®tes¬ª, n. 4, 1 april 1928, p. 124, 129. In his The Mystery of the Grail, Evola discarded Christian interpretations of the Holy Grail and wrote that it \\"symbolizes the principle of an immortalizing and transcendent force connected to the primordial state ... The mystery of the Grail is a mystery of a warrior initiation.\\" He held that the Ghibellines, who had fought the Guelph for control of Northern and Central Italy in the thirteenth century, had within them the residual influences of pre-Christian Celtic and Nordic traditions that represented his conception of the Grail myth. He also held that the Guelph victory against the Ghibellines represented a regression of the castes, since the merchant caste took over from the warrior caste. In the epilogue to this book, Evola argued that the fictitious The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, regardless of whether it was authentic or not, was a cogent representation of modernity.Richard Barber, The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief, Harvard University Press, 2004 The historian Richard Barber said, \\"Evola mixes rhetoric, prejudice, scholarship, and politics into a strange version of the present and future, but in the process he brings together for the first time interest in the esoteric and in conspiracy theory which characterize much of the later Grail literature.\\" =Buddhism= In his The Doctrine of Awakening, Evola argued that the PƒÅli Canon could be held to represent true Buddhism.T. Skorupski. The Buddhist Forum, Volume 4. Routledge, 2005, pp. 11‚Äì20 His interpretation of Buddhism is that it was intended to be anti-democratic. He believed that Buddhism revealed the essence of an \\"Aryan\\" tradition that had become corrupted and lost in the West. He believed it could be interpreted to reveal the superiority of a warrior caste. Harry Oldmeadow described Evola's work on Buddhism as exhibiting Nietzschean influence,Harry Oldmeadow. Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions. World Wisdom, Inc, 2004. p. 369 but Evola criticized Nietzsche's anti-ascetic prejudice. Evola claimed that the book \\"received the official approbation of the PƒÅli [Text] Society\\", and was published by a reputable Orientalist publisher. Evola's interpretation of Buddhism, as put forth in his article \\"Spiritual Virility in Buddhism\\", is in conflict with the post-WWII scholarship of the Orientalist Giuseppe Tucci, who argues that the viewpoint that Buddhism advocates universal benevolence is legitimate.Donald S. Lopez. Curators of the Buddha: The Study of Buddhism Under Colonialism. University of Chicago Press, 1995. p. 177 Arthur Versluis stated that Evola's writing on Buddhism was a vehicle for his own theories, but was a far from accurate rendition of the subject, and he held that much the same could be said of Evola's writing on Hermeticism.Arthur Versluis. Magic and Mysticism: An Introduction to Western Esoteric Traditions. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2007. p. 144-145 √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera was inspired to become a bhikkhu from reading Evola's text The Doctrine of Awakening in 1945 while hospitalized in Sorrento. =Modernity= Evola's Revolt Against the Modern World is a text that promotes the mythology of an ancient Golden Age. In this work, Evola described the features of his idealized traditional society. Evola argued that modernity represented a serious decline from an ideal society. He argued that in the postulated Golden age, religious and temporal power were united. He wrote that society had not been founded on priestly rule, but by warriors expressing spiritual power. In mythology, he saw evidence of the West's superiority over the East. Moreover, he claimed that the traditional elite had the ability to access power and knowledge through a hierarchical version of magic which differed from the lower \\"superstitious and fraudulent\\" forms of magic. Evola insists on \\"nonmodern forms, institutions, and knowledge\\" as being necessary to produce a \\"real renewal ... in those who are still capable of receiving it.\\" The text was \\"immediately recognized by Mircea Eliade and other intellectuals who allegedly advanced ideas associated with Tradition.\\" Eliade, one of the most influential historian of religions of the last century, was one of Evola's closest friends, and, in his youth, a fascist sympathizer associated with the Romanian Christian right wing movement Iron Guard. Evola was aware of the importance of myth from his readings of Georges Sorel, one of the key intellectual influences on fascism. Hermann Hesse described Revolt Against the Modern World as \\"really dangerous.\\"Mark Sedgwick. Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 105 During the 1960s Evola thought the right could no longer revert the degeneration process of modern civilization.Franco Ferraresi, ‚ÄòJulius Evola: Tradition, reaction, and the radical right‚Äô, European Journal of Sociology, vol. 28, no. 1, 1987, 107‚Äì51 (131). E. C. Wolff noted that this is why Evola wrote Ride the Tiger. Julius Evola chose to distance completely from active political engagement. However, he did not exclude the possibility of action in the future. He argued that one should stay firm and ready to intervene when the tiger \\"is tired of running.\\" Goodrick-Clarke notes that, \\"Evola sets up the ideal of the 'active nihilist' who is prepared to act with violence against modern decadence.\\" =Other writings= In the posthumously published collection of writings, Metaphysics of War, Evola, in line with the conservative revolutionary Ernst J√ºnger, explored the viewpoint that war could be a spiritually fulfilling experience. He proposed the necessity of a transcendental orientation in a warrior.Lennart Svensson. Ernst JungerA Portrait. Manticore Books, 2016. p. 202 From 1934 to 1943 Evola was also responsible for ‚ÄòDiorama Filosofico‚Äô, the cultural page of Il Regime Fascista, a daily newspaper owned by Roberto Farinacci. He would also contribute during the same period to Giovanni Preziosi magazine La vita italiana. Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke has written that Evola's 1945 essay \\"American 'Civilization'\\" described the United States as \\"the final stage of European decline into the 'interior formlessness' of vacuous individualism, conformity and vulgarity under the universal aegis of money-making.\\" According to Goodrick-Clarke, Evola argued that U.S. \\"mechanistic and rational philosophy of progress combined with a mundane horizon of prosperity to transform the world into an enormous suburban shopping mall.\\" Evola translated some works of Oswald Spengler and Ortega y Gasset to Italian. Occultism and esotericism Around 1920, Evola's interests led him into spiritual, transcendental, and \\"supra-rational\\" studies. He began reading various esoteric texts and gradually delved deeper into the occult, alchemy, magic, and Oriental studies, particularly Tibetan Tantric yoga. A keen mountaineer, Evola described the experience as a source of revelatory spiritual experiences. After his return from the war, Evola experimented with hallucinogens and magic. When he was about 23 years old, Evola considered suicide. He claimed that he avoided suicide thanks to a revelation he had while reading an early Buddhist text that dealt with shedding all forms of identity other than absolute transcendence. Evola would later publish the text The Doctrine of Awakening, which he regarded as a repayment of his debt to Buddhism for saving him from suicide. Evola wrote prodigiously on Eastern mysticism, Tantra, hermeticism, the myth of the Holy Grail and Western esotericism. German Egyptologist and esoteric scholar Florian Ebeling has noted that Evola's The Hermetic Tradition is viewed as an \\"extremely important work on Hermeticism\\" in the eyes of esotericists.Florian Ebeling. The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from Ancient to Modern Times. Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 138 Evola gave particular focus to Cesare della Riviera's text Il Mondo Magico degli Heroi, which he later republished in modern Italian. He held that Riviera's text was consonant with the goals of \\"high magic\\"the reshaping of the earthly human into a transcendental 'god man'. According to Evola, the alleged \\"timeless\\" Traditional science was able to come to lucid expression through this text, in spite of the \\"coverings\\" added to it to prevent accusations from the church. Though Evola rejected Carl Jung's interpretation of alchemy, Jung described Evola's The Hermetic Tradition as a \\"magisterial account of Hermetic philosophy\\".Lux in Tenebris: The Visual and the Symbolic in Western Esotericism. BRILL, 2016 In Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition, the philosopher Glenn Alexander Magee favored Evola's interpretation over that of Jung's.Glenn Alexander Magee. Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition. Cornell University Press, 2008. p. 200 In 1988, a journal devoted to Hermetic thought published a section of Evola's book and described it as \\"Luciferian.\\" Evola later confessed that he was not a Buddhist, and that his text on Buddhism was meant to balance his earlier work on the Hindu tantras. Evola's interest in tantra was spurred on by correspondence with John Woodroffe. Evola was attracted to the active aspect of tantra, and its claim to provide a practical means to spiritual experience, over the more \\"passive\\" approaches in other forms of Eastern spirituality.Kathleen Taylor. Sir John Woodroffe, Tantra and Bengal: 'An Indian Soul in a European Body?' . Routledge, 2012. p. 135 In Tantric Buddhism in East Asia, Richard K. Payne, Dean of the Institute of Buddhist Studies, argued that Evola manipulated Tantra in the service of right wing violence, and that the emphasis on \\"power\\" in The Yoga of Power gave insight into his mentality.Richard K. Payne. Tantric Buddhism in East Asia. Simon and Schuster, 2006. p. 229 Evola advocated that \\"differentiated individuals\\" following the Left-Hand Path use dark violent sexual powers against the modern world. For Evola, these \\"virile heroes\\" are both generous and cruel, possess the ability to rule, and commit \\"Dionysian\\" acts that might be seen as conventionally immoral. For Evola, the Left Hand path embraces violence as a means of transgression. According to A. James Gregor Evola's definition of spirituality can be found in Meditations on the Peaks: \\"what has been successfully actualized and translated into a sense of superiority which is experienced inside by the soul, and a noble demeanor, which is expressed in the body.\\" Goodrick-Clarke wrote that Evola's \\"rigorous New Age spirituality speaks directly to those who reject absolutely the leveling world of democracy, capitalism, multi-racialism and technology at the outset of the twenty-first century. Their acute sense of cultural chaos can find powerful relief in his ideal of total renewal.\\" Thomas Sheehan wrote that to \\"read Evola is to take a trip through a weird and fascinating jungle of ancient mythologies, pseudo-ethnology, and transcendental mysticism that is enough to make any southern California consciousness-tripper feel quite at home.\\"Thomas Sheehan. Italy: Terror on the Right. The New York Review of Books, Volume 27, Number 21 & 22, January 22, 1981 =Magical idealism= Thomas Sheehan wrote that \\"Evola's first philosophical works from the 'twenties were dedicated to reshaping neo-idealism from a philosophy of Absolute Spirit and Mind into a philosophy of the \\"absolute individual\\" and action.\\" Accordingly, Evola developed the doctrine of \\"magical idealism\\", which held that \\"the Ego must understand that everything that seems to have a reality independent of it is nothing but an illusion, caused by its own deficiency.\\" For Evola, this ever- increasing unity with the \\"absolute individual\\" was consistent with unconstrained liberty, and therefore unconditional power. In his 1925 work Essays on Magical Idealism, Evola declared that \\"God does not exist. The Ego must create him by making itself divine.\\" According to Sheehan, Evola discovered the power of metaphysical mythology while developing his theories. This led to his advocacy of supra-rational intellectual intuition over discursive knowledge. In Evola's view, discursive knowledge separates man from Being. Sheehan stated that this position is a theme in certain interpretations of Western philosophers such as Plato, Thomas Aquinas, and Martin Heidegger that was exaggerated by Evola.Thomas Sheehan. Myth and Violence: The Fascism of Julius Evola and Alain de Benoist. Social Research, XLVIII, 1 (Spring, 1981). 45‚Äì73 Evola would later write: Evola developed a doctrine of the \\"two natures\\": the natural world and the primordial \\"world of 'Being'\\". He believed that these \\"two natures\\" impose form and quality on lower matter and create a hierarchical \\"great chain of Being.\\" He understood \\"spiritual virility\\" as signifying orientation towards this postulated transcendent principle. He held that the State should reflect this \\"ordering from above\\" and the consequent hierarchical differentiation of individuals according to their \\"organic preformation\\". By \\"organic preformation\\" he meant that which \\"gathers, preserves, and refines one's talents and qualifications for determinate functions.\\" =Ur Group= Evola was introduced to esotericism by Arturo Reghini, who was an early supporter of fascism. Reghini sought to promote a \\"cultured magic\\" opposed to Christianity and introduced Evola to the traditionalist Ren√© Gu√©non. In 1927, Reghini and Evola, along with other Italian esotericists, founded the Gruppo di Ur (\\"Ur Group\\"). The purpose of this group was to attempt to bring the members' individual identities into such a superhuman state of power and awareness that they would be able to exert a magical influence on the world. The group employed techniques from Buddhist, Tantric, and rare Hermetic texts.Nevill Drury. The Dictionary of the Esoteric: 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2004. p. 96 They aimed to provide a \\"soul\\" to the burgeoning Fascist movement of the time through the revival of ancient Roman religion, and to influence the fascist regime through esotericism.Isotta Poggi. \\"Alternative Spirituality in Italy.\\" In: James R. Lewis, J. Gordon Melton. Perspectives on the New Age. SUNY Press, 1992. Page 276. Articles on occultism from the Ur Group were later published in Introduction to Magic.Gary Lachman. Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen. Quest Books, 2012. p. 215 Reghini's support of Freemasonry would however prove a bone of contention for Evola; accordingly, Evola broke with Reghini in 1928. Reghini himself broke from Evola, accusing Evola of plagiarizing his thoughts in the book Pagan Imperialism. Evola, on the other hand, blamed Reghini for the premature publication of Pagan Imperialism. Evola's later work owed a considerable debt to Ren√© Gu√©non's text Crisis of the Modern World, though he diverged from Gu√©non on the issue of the relationship between warriors and priests. =Views on sex and gender roles= Julius Evola believed that the alleged higher qualities expected of a man of a particular race were not those expected of a woman of the same race. He held that \\"just relations between the sexes\\" involved women acknowledging their \\"inequality\\" with men. In 1925, he wrote an article titled \\"La donna come cosa\\" (\\"Woman as Thing\\"). Evola later quoted Joseph de Maistre's statement that \\"Woman cannot be superior except as woman, but from the moment in which she desires to emulate man she is nothing but a monkey.\\"Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Post-war fascisms. Taylor & Francis, 2004. p. 246 Evola believed that women's liberation was \\"the renunciation by woman of her right to be a woman\\".Franco Ferraresi. Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War. Princeton University Press, 2012. p. 220 A woman \\"could traditionally participate in the sacred hierarchical order only in a mediated fashion through her relationship with a man.\\" He held, as a feature of his idealized gender relations, the Hindu sati, which for him was a form of sacrifice indicating women's respect for patriarchal traditions.R. Ben-Ghiat, M. Fuller. Italian Colonialism. Springer, 2016. p. 149 For the \\"pure, feminine\\" woman, \\"man is not perceived by her as a mere husband or lover, but as her lord.\\" Women would find their true identity in total subjugation to men. Evola regarded matriarchy and goddess religions as a symptom of decadence, and preferred a hyper-masculine, warrior ethos.J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann. Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition [6 volumes]: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices. ABC-CLIO, 2010. p. 1085 Evola was influenced by Hans Bl√ºher; he was a proponent of the M√§nnerbund concept as a model for his proposed ultra-fascist \\"Order\\". Goodrick-Clarke noted the fundamental influence of Otto Weininger's book Sex and Character on Evola's dualism of male-female spirituality. According to Goodrich-Clarke, \\"Evola's celebration of virile spirituality was rooted in Weininger's work, which was widely translated by the end of the First World War.\\" Unlike Weininger, Evola believed that women needed to be conquered, not ignored. Evola denounced homosexuality as \\"useless\\" for his purposes. He did not neglect sadomasochism, so long as sadism and masochism \\"are magnifications of an element potentially present in the deepest essence of eros.\\" Then, it would be possible to \\"extend, in a transcendental and perhaps ecstatic way, the possibilities of sex.\\" Evola held that women \\"played\\" with men, threatened their masculinity, and lured them into a \\"constrictive\\" grasp with their sexuality. He wrote that \\"It should not be expected of women that they return to what they really are ... when men themselves retain only the semblance of true virility\\", and lamented that \\"men instead of being in control of sex are controlled by it and wander about like drunkards\\". He believed that in Tantra and in sex magic, in which he saw a strategy for aggression, he found the means to counter the \\"emasculated\\" West. According to Annalisa Merelli, Evola \\"went so far as to justify rape\\" because he saw it \\"as a natural expression of male desire\\". Evola also said that the \\"ritual violation of virgins\\", and \\"whipping women\\" were a means of \\"consciousness raising\\", so long as these practices were done to the intensity required to produce the proper \\"liminal psychic climate\\". He wrote that \\"as a rule, nothing stirs a man more than feeling the woman utterly exhausted beneath his own hostile rapture.\\"Annalisa Merelli. \\"Steve Bannon‚Äôs interest in a thinker who inspired fascism exposes the misogyny of the alt- right\\". Quartz. February 22, 2017 Evola translated Weininger's Sex and Character into Italian. Dissatisfied with simply translating Weininger's work, he wrote the text Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex, where his views on sexuality were dealt with at length. Arthur Versluis described this text as Evola's \\"most interesting\\" work aside from Revolt Against the Modern World. This book remains popular among many 'New Age' adherents. Views on race Evola's dissent from standard biological concepts of race had roots in his aristocratic elitism, since Nazi v√∂lkisch ideology inadequately separated aristocracy from \\"commoners.\\" According to Furlong, Evola developed \\"the law of the regression of castes\\" in Revolt Against the Modern World and other writings on racism from the 1930s and World War II period. In Evola's view \\"power and civilization have progressed from one to another of the four castes‚Äîsacred leaders, warrior nobility, bourgeoisie (economy, 'merchants') and slaves\\". Furlong explains: \\"for Evola, the core of racial superiority lay in the spiritual qualities of the higher castes, which expressed themselves in physical as well as in cultural features, but were not determined by them. The law of the regression of castes places racism at the core of Evola's philosophy, since he sees an increasing predominance of lower races as directly expressed through modern mass democracies.\\" In 1941, Evola's book Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race (Italian: Sintesi di Dottrina della Razza) was published by Hoepli. It provides an overview of his ideas concerning race and eugenics, introducing the concept of \\"spiritual racism\\", and \\"esoteric-traditionalist racism\\". Prior to the end of War, Evola had frequently used the term \\"Aryan\\" to mean the nobility, who in his view were imbued with traditional spirituality. Wolff notes that Evola seems to have stopped writing about race in 1945, but adds that the intellectual themes of Evola's writings were otherwise unchanged. Evola continued to write about elitism and his contempt for the weak. His \\"doctrine of the Aryan-Roman 'super-race was simply restated as a doctrine of the 'leaders of men' ... no longer with reference to the SS, but to the mediaeval Teutonic knights of the Knights Templar, already mentioned in Rivolta.\\" Evola spoke of \\"inferior non- European races\\". Peter Merkl wrote that \\"Evola was never prepared to discount the value of blood altogether\\". Evola wrote: \\"a certain balanced consciousness and dignity of race can be considered healthy\\" in a time where \\"the exaltation of the negro and all the rest, anticolonialist psychosis and integrationist fanaticism [are] all parallel phenomena in the decline of Europe and the West.\\"Peter H. Merkl. Political Violence and Terror: Motifs and Motivations. University of California Press, 1986. p. 85 While not totally against race- mixing, in 1957, Evola wrote an article attributing the perceived acceleration of American decadence to the influence of \\"negroes\\" and the opposition to segregation. Furlong noted that this article is \\"among the most extreme in phraseology of any he wrote, and exhibits a degree of intolerance that leaves no doubt as to his deep prejudice against black people.\\" =National mysticism= For his spiritual interpretation of the different racial psychologies, Evola found the work of German race theorist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss invaluable. Like Evola, Clauss believed that physical race and spiritual race could diverge as a consequence of miscegenation. Evola's racism included racism of the body, soul, and spirit, giving primacy to the latter factor, writing that \\"races only declined when their spirit failed.\\" Like Ren√© Gu√©non, Evola believed that mankind is living in the Kali Yuga of the Hindu tradition‚Äîthe Dark Age of unleashed, materialistic appetites. He argued that both Italian fascism and Nazism represented hope that the \\"celestial\\" Aryan race would be reconstituted.A. James Gregor, Mussolini's Intellectuals: Fascist Social and Political Thought. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005. He drew on mythological accounts of super-races and their decline, particularly the Hyperboreans, and maintained that traces of Hyperborean influence could be felt in Indo-European man. He felt that Indo- European men had devolved from these higher mythological races. Gregor noted that several contemporary criticisms of Evola's theory were published: \\"In one of Fascism's most important theoretical journals, Evola's critic pointed out that many Nordic-Aryans, not to speak of Mediterranean Aryans, fail to demonstrate any Hyperborean properties. Instead, they make obvious their materialism, their sensuality, their indifference to loyalty and sacrifice, together with their consuming greed. How do they differ from 'inferior' races, and why should anyone wish, in any way, to favor them?\\" Concerning the relationship between \\"spiritual racism\\" and biological racism, Evola put forth the following viewpoint, which Furlong described as pseudo-scientific: =Views on Jews= Evola endorsed Otto Weininger's views on the Jews. Though Evola viewed Jews as corrosive and anti-traditional, he described Adolf Hitler's more fanatical antisemitism as a paranoid id√©e fixe that damaged the reputation of the Third Reich. Evola's conception did not emphasize the Nazi racial conception of Jews as \\"representatives of a biological race\\"‚Äîin Evola's view the Jews were \\"the carriers of a world view ... a spirit [that] corresponded to the 'worst' and 'most decadent' features of modernity: democracy, egalitarianism and materialism.\\" Evola argued that the fabricated antisemitic text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion‚Äîwhether or not a forgery‚Äîaccurately reflect the conditions of modernity. He believed that the Protocols \\"contain the plan for an occult war, whose objective is the utter destruction, in the non-Jewish peoples, of all tradition, class, aristocracy, and hierarchy, and of all moral, religious, and spiritual values.\\"Horst Junginger. The Study of Religion Under the Impact of Fascism. BRILL, 2008. p. 136 He wrote the foreword to the second Italian edition of the Protocols, which was published by the Fascist Giovanni Preziosi in 1938.Oren Nimni and Nathan J. Robinson. Alan Dershowitz Takes Anti-Semitism Very Seriously Indeed. Current Affairs. November 16, 2016 Following the murder of his friend Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Fascist Romanian Iron Guard, Evola expressed anticipation of a \\"talmudic, Israelite tyranny.\\"Julius Evola, ‚ÄúLa tragedia della ‚ÄòGuardia di Ferro‚Äù in La vita italiana 309 (December 1938), quoted in Franco Ferraresi, ‚ÄúJulius Evola: Tradition, Reaction, and the Radical Right,‚Äù in European Journal of Sociology 28 (1987), 107‚Äì51 (pp. 129‚Äì30). However, Evola believed that Jews had this \\"power\\" only because of European \\"decadence\\" in modernity. He also believed that one could be \\"Aryan\\", but have a \\"Jewish\\" soul, just as one could be \\"Jewish\\", but have an \\"Aryan\\" soul.Gary Lachman. Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen. Quest Books, 2012. p. 217 In Evola's view, Otto Weininger and Carlo Michelstaedter were Jews of \\"sufficiently heroic, ascetic, and sacral\\" character to fit the latter category. Fascism Evola developed a line of argument, closely related to the spiritual orientation of Traditionalist writers such as Ren√© Gu√©non and the political concerns of the European authoritarian right. Evola's first published political work was an anti-fascist piece in 1925. In this work, Evola called Italy's fascist movement a \\"laughable revolution,\\" based on empty sentiment and materialistic concerns. He applauded Mussolini's anti- bourgeois orientation and his goal of making Italian citizens into hardened warriors, but criticized Fascist populism, party politics, and elements of leftism that he saw in the fascist regime. Evola saw Mussolini's Fascist Party as possessing no cultural or spiritual foundation. He was passionate about infusing it with these elements in order to make it suitable for his ideal conception of √úbermensch culture which, in Evola's view, characterized the imperial grandeur of pre-Christian Europe. He expressed anti-nationalist sentiment, stating that to become \\"truly human,\\" one would have to \\"overcome brotherly contamination\\" and \\"purge oneself\\" of the feeling that one is united with others \\"because of blood, affections, country or human destiny.\\" He also opposed the futurism that Italian fascism was aligned with, along with the \\"plebeian\\" nature of the movement. Accordingly, Evola launched the journal La Torre (The Tower), to voice his concerns and advocate for a more elitist fascism. Evola's ideas were poorly received by the fascist mainstream as it stood at the time of his writing. =Mussolini= Julius Evola (1940) Scholars disagree about why Benito Mussolini embraced racist ideology in 1938‚Äîsome scholars have written that Mussolini was more motivated by political considerations than ideology when he introduced antisemitic legislation in Italy.See Renzo de Felice, Storia degli ebrei; A. James Gregor; Meir Michaelis, Mussolini and the Jews; contra Aaron Gillette, Racial Theories in Fascist Italy, Ch. 4 Other scholars have rejected the argument that the racial ideology of Italian fascism could be attributed solely to Nazi influence.See Luigi Preti (1968) for discussion of miscegenation; Gene Bernardini (1977) for discussion of German influence A more recent interpretation is that Mussolini was frustrated by the slow pace of fascist transformation and, by 1938, had adopted increasingly radical measures including a racial ideology. Aaron Gillette has written that \\"Racism would become the key driving force behind the creation of the new fascist man, the uomo fascista.\\"Gillette, Racial Theories, pp. 51‚Äì53 Mussolini read Evola's Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race in August 1941, and met with Evola to offer him his praise. Evola later recounted that Mussolini had found in his work a uniquely Roman form of Fascist racism distinct from that found in Nazi Germany. With Mussolini's backing, Evola started preparing the launch of a minor journal Sangue e Spirito (Blood and Spirit) which never appeared. While not always in agreement with German racial theorists, Evola traveled to Germany in February 1942 and obtained support for German collaboration on Sangue e Spirito from \\"key figures in the German racial hierarchy.\\" Fascists appreciated the palingenetic value of Evola's \\"proof\\" \\"that the true representatives of the state and the culture of ancient Rome were people of the Nordic race.\\" Evola eventually became Italy's leading racial philosopher. Evola blended Sorelianism with Mussolini's eugenics agenda. Evola has written that \\"The theory of the Aryo- Roman race and its corresponding myth could integrate the Roman idea proposed, in general, by fascism, as well as give a foundation to Mussolini's plan to use his state as a means to elevate the average Italian and to enucleate in him a new man.\\"Gillette, Racial Theories, p. 54 In May, 1951, Evola was arrested and charged with promoting the revival of the Fascist Party, and of glorifying Fascism. Defending himself at trial, Evola stated that his work belonged to a long tradition of anti-democratic writers who certainly could be linked to fascism‚Äîat least fascism interpreted according to certain Evolian criteria‚Äîbut who certainly could not be identified with the Fascist regime under Mussolini. Evola then declared that he was not a Fascist but was instead \\"\\" (). He was acquitted.Wolff, Elisabetta Cassini. \\"Evola's interpretation of fascism and moral responsibility\\", Patterns of Prejudice, Vol. 50, Issue 4‚Äì5, 2016. pp. 478‚Äì494 =Third Reich= Finding Italian fascism too compromising, Evola began to seek recognition in Nazi Germany. Evola spent a considerable amount of time in Germany in 1937 and 1938, and gave a series of lectures to the German‚ÄìItalian Society in 1938. Evola took issue with Nazi populism and biological materialism. SS authorities initially rejected Evola's ideas as supranational and aristocratic though he was better received by members of the conservative revolutionary movement. The Nazi Ahnenerbe reported that many considered his ideas to be pure \\"fantasy\\" which ignored \\"historical facts.\\". Evola admired Heinrich Himmler, whom he knew personally, but he had reservations about Adolf Hitler because of Hitler's reliance on v√∂lkisch nationalism. Himmler's Schutzstaffel (\\"SS\\") kept a dossier on Evola‚Äîdossier document AR-126 described his plans for a \\"Roman-Germanic Imperium\\" as \\"utopian\\" and described him as a \\"reactionary Roman,\\" whose goal was an \\"insurrection of the old aristocracy against the modern world.\\" The document recommended that the SS \\"stop his effectiveness in Germany\\" and provide him with no support, particularly because of his desire to create a \\"secret international order\\".H.T. Hansen, \\"A Short Introduction to Julius Evola\\" in Evola, Revolt Against the Modern World, p xviii.A. James Gregor and Andreas Umland. Erw√§gen Wissen Ethik, 15: 3 & 4 (2004), pp. 424-429, 591-595; vol. 16: 4 (2005), pp. 566-572 Dugin Not a Fascist? Despite this opposition, Evola was able to establish political connections with pan-Europeanist elements inside the Reich Main Security Office. Evola subsequently ascended to the inner circles of Nazism as the influence of pan-European advocates overtook that of V√∂lkisch proponents, due to military contingencies. Evola wrote the article Reich and Imperium as Elements in the New European Order for the Nazi-backed journal European Review. He spent World War II working for the Sicherheitsdienst. The Sicherheitsdienst bureau Amt VII, a Reich Main Security Office research library, helped Evola acquire arcane occult and Masonic texts.Nigel Graddon. Otto Rahn and the Quest for the Grail: The Amazing Life of the Real Indiana Jones. SCB Distributors, 2013 Italian Fascism went into decline when, in 1943, Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned. At this point, Evola fled to Germany with the help of the Sicherheitsdienst. Although not a member of the National Fascist Party, and despite his apparent problems with the Fascist regime, Evola was one of the first people to greet Mussolini when the latter was broken out of prison by Otto Skorzeny in September, 1943.Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Post-war fascisms. Taylor & Francis, 2004. p. 223 Subsequently, Evola helped welcome Mussolini to Adolf Hitler's Wolf's Lair. Following this, Evola involved himself in Mussolini's Italian Social Republic. It was Evola's custom to walk around the city of Vienna during bombing raids in order to better \\"ponder his destiny\\". During one such raid, 1945, a shell fragment damaged his spinal cord and he became paralyzed from the waist down, remaining so for the rest of his life.Guido Stucco, \\"Translator's Introduction,\\" in Evola, The Yoga of Power, pp. ix‚Äìxv Post- World War II Julius EvolaSmƒõrnice (2015), the Czech translation of his book Orientamenti (1950) About the alliance during World War II between Allies and the Soviet Union, Evola wrote: > The democratic powers repeated the error of those who think they can use the > forces of subversion for their own ends without cost. They do not know that, > by a fatal logic, when exponents of two different grades of subversion meet > or cross paths, the one representing the more developed grade will take over > in the end.Evola, Rivolta contro il mondo moderno p. 385.FURLONG, P. Social > and Political Thought of Julius Evola, London: Routledge, 2011, p. 50. The political model Evola selected after 1945 was neither Mussolini nor Hitler.Interview with Pino Rauti, in Francesco Giorgino and Nicola Rao, L‚Äôun contro l‚Äôaltro armati: dieci testimonianze della guerra civile (1943‚Äì1945) (Milan: Mursia 1995), 42‚Äì3. Evola cited and encouraged the youth to read Plato (with reference in particular to The Republic), Dante (with reference in particular to De Monarchia), Joseph de Maistre, Donoso Cort√©s, Bismarck, Metternich, Gaetano Mosca, Pareto and Michels.Julius Evola, ‚ÄòLa legge contro le idee‚Äô, Meridiano d‚ÄôItalia, 23 September 1951, in Evola, I testi del Meridiano d‚ÄôItalia, 103‚Äì4; and Julius Evola, ‚ÄòIl coraggio di dirsi antidemocratici non equivale necessariamente a dichiararsi fascisti‚Äô, La rivolta ideale, 17 January 1952, in Evola, I testi de La rivolta ideale, 56‚Äì8. After World War II, Evola continued his work in esotericism. He wrote a number of books and articles on sex magic and various other esoteric studies, including The Yoga of Power: Tantra, Shakti, and the Secret Way (1949), Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex (1958), and Meditations on the Peaks: Mountain Climbing as Metaphor for the Spiritual Quest (1974). He also wrote his two explicitly political books Men Among the Ruins: Post-War Reflections of a Radical Traditionalist (1953), Ride the Tiger: A Survival Manual for the Aristocrats of the Soul (1961), and his autobiography, The Path of Cinnabar (1963). He also expanded upon critiques of American civilization and materialism, as well as increasing American influence in Europe, collected in the posthumous anthology Civilt√† Americana. While trying to distance himself from Nazism, Evola wrote in 1955 that the Nuremberg trials were a farce. This indicates that despite being rejected by the SS before the war, he never stopped admiring their criminal activities. Evola's occult ontology exerted influence over post-war neo-fascism. In the post-war period, Evola's writing evoked interest among the neo-fascist right. After 1945, Evola was considered the most important Italian theoretician of the conservative revolutionary movement and the \\"chief ideologue\\" of Italy's post-war radical right. According to Egil Asprem and Kennet Granholm, Evola's most significant post-war political texts are Orientamenti and Men Among the Ruins.Egil Asprem, Kennet Granholm. Contemporary Esotericism. Routledge, 2014. p. 245 In the opening phrase in the first edition of Men Among the Ruins, Evola said: > Our adversaries would undoubtedly want us, in a Christian spirit, under the > banner of progress or reform, having been struck on one cheek to turn the > other. Our principle is different: ‚ÄúDo to others what they would like to do > to you: but do it to them first.EVOLA, J., Gli Uomini e le Rovine, Roma: > Edizioni dell‚ÄôAscia, 1953, p. 16. Orientamenti was a text against \\"national fascism\\"‚Äîinstead, it advocated for a European Community modeled on the principles of the Waffen-SS. The Italian neo-fascist group Ordine Nuovo adopted Orientamenti as a guide for action in postwar Italy.Marlene Laruelle. Eurasianism and the European Far Right: Reshaping the Europe‚ÄìRussia Relationship. Lexington Books, 2015. p. 102 The European Liberation Front, who were affiliated with Francis Parker Yockey, called Evola \\"Italy's greatest living authoritarian philosopher\\" in the April 1951 issue of their publication Frontfighter. During the post-war period, Evola attempted to dissociate himself from totalitarianism, preferring the concept of the \\"organic\\" state, which he put forth in his text Men Among the Ruins. Evola sought to develop a strategy for the implementation of a \\"conservative revolution\\" in post-World War II Europe. He rejected nationalism, advocating instead for a European Imperium, which could take various forms according to local conditions, but should be \\"organic, hierarchical, anti-democratic, and anti-individual.\\" Evola endorsed Francis Parker Yockey's neo-fascist manifesto Imperium, but disagreed with it because he believed that Yockey had a \\"superficial\\" understanding of what was immediately possible. Evola believed that his conception of neo-fascist Europe could best be implemented by an elite of \\"superior\\" men who operated outside normal politics. In Men Among the Ruins, Evola defines the Fourth Estate as being the last stage in the cyclical development of the social elite, the first beginning with the monarchy. Expanding the concept in an essay in 1950, the Fourth State according to Evola would be characterized by \\"the collectivist civilization... the communist society of the faceless-massman\\". Giuliano Salierni was an activist in the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement during the early 1950s. He later recalled Evola's calls to violence. Roberto Fiore and his colleagues in the early 1980s helped the National Fronts \\"Political Soldiers\\" forge a militant elitist philosophy based on Evola's \\"most militant tract\\", The Aryan Doctrine of Battle and Victory. The Aryan Doctrine called for a \\"Great Holy War\\" that would be fought for spiritual renewal and fought in parallel to the physical \\"Little Holy War\\" against perceived enemies. Wolff attributes extreme-right terrorist actions in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s to the influence of Julius Evola. Thomas Sheehan has argued that Evola's work is essential reading for those seeking to understand European neo-fascism, in the same way that knowledge of the writings of Karl Marx is necessary for those seeking to understand Communist actions. Political influence At one time Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, the Nazi Grail seeker Otto Rahn, and the Romanian fascist sympathizer and religious historian Mircea Eliade admired Julius Evola. After World War II, Evola's writings continued to influence many European far-right political, racist and neo-fascist movements. He is widely translated in French, Spanish, partly in German, and mostly in Hungarian (the largest number of his translated works).http://www.tradicio.org/bibliographia.pdf> pp. 130‚Äì154] Umberto Eco referred to Evola as the \\"most influential theoretical source of the theories of the new Italian right\\", and as \\"one of the most respected fascist gurus\\".Eco, Umberto. \\"Ur-Fascism\\". The New York Review of Books, Vol. 42, No. 11 (1995), accessed February 12, 2017 Giorgio Almirante referred to him as \\"our Marcuse--only better.\\" According to one leader of the neofascist \\"black terrorist\\" Ordine Nuovo, \\"Our work since 1953 has been to transpose Evola's teachings into direct political action.\\"Quoted in Ferraresi, Franco. \\"The Radical Right in Postwar Italy.\\" Politics & Society. 1988 16:71-119.

Jonathan Bowden, English political activist and chairman of the far right, spoke highly of Evola and his ideas and gave lectures on his philosophy. Evola has influenced Vladimir Putin advisorMeyer, Henry and Ant, Onur. \\"The One Russian Linking Putin, Erdogan and Trump\\". Bloomberg, February 2017 Aleksander Dugin.Marlene Laruelle. Aleksandr Dugin: A Russian Version of the European Radical Right? Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. OCCASIONAL PAPER #294. The Greek neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn includes his works on its suggested reading list, and the leader of Jobbik, the Hungarian nationalist party, admires Evola and wrote an introduction to his works. Donald Trump's former chief adviser Steve Bannon has pointed to Evola's influence on the Eurasianism movement;Feder, J. Lester. \\"This Is How Steve Bannon Sees The Entire World\\", BuzzFeed 2016 According to Joshua Green's book Devil's Bargain, Evola's Revolt Against the Modern World had initially drawn Bannon's interest to the ideas of the Traditionalist School. Alt-right leader and white nationalist Richard Spencer said that Bannon's awareness of Evola \\"means a tremendous amount\\". Some members of the alt-right expressed hope that Bannon might have been open to Evola's ideas, and that through Bannon, Evola's ideas could become influential. According to multiple historians cited by The Atlantic, this is contradictory, as Bannon cited Evola in defense of the \\"Judeo-Christian west\\", while Evola hated and opposed Judaism and Jews, Christianity in general, Anglo-Saxon Protestantism specifically, and the culture of the United States. In a leaked email sent by Bannon in March 2016, he told Milo Yiannopoulos, \\"I do appreciate any piece that mentions Evola.\\" Evola has also influenced the alt-right movement.

It was part of a family of related technologies which bridged the gap between vacuum tubes and semiconductors by exploiting the magnetic properties of materials to perform switching and amplification.

Career =Whirlwind project/Magnetic core memory/Computer graphics= Project Whirlwind core memory, circa 1951 During the 1940s and early 50s, Forrester did research in electrical and computer engineering at MIT, heading the Whirlwind project, perfecting magnetic-core memory,Katie Hafner, \\"Jay W. Forrester Dies at 98; a Pioneer in Computer Models\\", The New York Times, November 17, 2016. and developing the \\"multi-coordinate digital information storage device\\"Multicoordinate digital information storage device, US patent 2736880 (coincident-current system), the forerunner of today's RAM. He is also believed to have created the first animation in the history of computer graphics, a \\"jumping ball\\" on an oscilloscope. =Forrester effect= In 1956, Forrester moved to the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he was Germeshausen Professor Emeritus and Senior Lecturer. In 1961, arising from a project with General Electric, he wrote about the expanding effects down the supply chains due to fluctuations in demand, originally known as the Forrester effect and today the \\"bullwhip effect\\". In 1972, he received the IEEE Medal of Honor, IEEEs highest award. In 1982, he received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award. In 1995, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum \\"for his perfecting of core memory technology into a practical computer memory device; for fundamental contributions to early computer systems design and development\\". In 2006, he was inducted into the Operational Research Hall of Fame. =System dynamics= Forrester was the founder of system dynamics, which deals with the simulation of interactions between objects in dynamic systems. Industrial Dynamics was the first book Forrester wrote using system dynamics to analyze industrial business cycles. Several years later, interactions with former Boston Mayor John F. Collins led Forrester to write Urban Dynamics, which sparked an ongoing debate on the feasibility of modeling broader social problems. The book went on to influence the video game SimCity. The urban dynamics model attracted the attention of urban planners around the world, eventually leading Forrester to meet a founder of the Club of Rome. He later met with the Club of Rome to discuss issues surrounding global sustainability; the book World Dynamics followed. World Dynamics took on modeling the complex interactions of the world economy, population and ecology, which was controversial (see also Donella Meadows and Limits to Growth). It was the start of the field of global modeling. Forrester continued working in applications of system dynamics and promoting its use in education. =Publications= Forrester has written several books, articles and papers. Books, a selection: * 1961.

Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems is a 1971 paper by Jay Wright Forrester. In it, Forrester argues that the use of computerized system models to inform social policy is far superior to simple debate, both in generating insight into the root causes of problems and in understanding the likely effects of proposed solutions. =Description= Forrester characterizes normal debate and discussion as being dominated by inexact mental models: :The mental model is fuzzy. It is incomplete. It is imprecisely stated. Furthermore, within one individual, a mental model changes with time and even during the flow of a single conversation. The human mind assembles a few relationships to fit the context of a discussion. As the subject shifts so does the model. When only a single topic is being discussed, each participant in a conversation employs a different mental model to interpret the subject. Fundamental assumptions differ but are never brought into the open. Goals are different and are left unstated. It is little wonder that compromise takes so long. And it is not surprising that consensus leads to laws and programs that fail in their objectives or produce new difficulties greater than those that have been relieved. The paper summarizes the results of a previous study on the system dynamics governing economic dynamics in urban centers, which showed \\"how industry, housing, and people interact with each other as a city grows and decays.\\" The study's findings, presented more fully in Forrester's 1969 book Urban Dynamics, suggest that the root cause of depressed economic conditions is a significant shortage of job opportunities relative to the population level, and that the most popular solutions proposed at the time (e.g. an increase in the amount of low-income housing available, or a reduction in real estate taxes) counter-intuitively serve to make the situation worse by increasing the population but not the availability of jobs, so that the relative shortage increases. The paper further suggests that measures to reduce the shortage -- such as the conversion of land use from housing to industry, or an increase in real estate taxes to spur redevelopment of property -- would counter-intuitively create the result desired when enacting the failed policies. The paper also gives an overview of Forrester's model of world dynamics that correlates population, food production, industrial development, pollution, availability of natural resources, and quality of life, as well as projections of those values into the future under various assumptions. This model is presented more fully in Forrester's 1971 World Dynamics, and is notable primarily because it served as the initial basis for the World3 model used by Donella and Dennis Meadows in their popular 1972 book The Limits to Growth.
