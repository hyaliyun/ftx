Early life Tapani was raised in Escanaba in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He quarterbacked Escanaba High School to the 1981 MHSAA Class A State Football Championship. Tapani then went on to attend Central Michigan University, where he was a star pitcher for the Chippewas from 1983 to 1986, finishing with a career record of 23-8, helping the Chippewas to three Mid- American Conference titles, and tossing a no-hitter against Eastern Michigan University in 1986. In 1985, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Tapani was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the ninth round of the 1985 MLB June amateur draft, but he did not sign. He was then selected on June 2, 1986 in the second round of the 1986 MLB June amateur draft by the Oakland Athletics. Tapani signed five days later and was assigned to Medford A's of the low Single-A Northwest League. However, he did not stay at Medford long, as after stops in Modesto and Huntsville, he made his final start of his first season in professional baseball pitching for the Triple-A Tacoma Tigers and finished the year a combined 8-2 with a 2.84 ERA and 47 strikeouts in 85 2/3 innings. In 1987, Tapani began at Single-A Modesto, despite dominating at the level the previous year, and turned in another good season with a 10-7 record, a 3.76 ERA, and 121 strikeouts in 148 1/3 innings. On December 11, a three-team trade was completed that saw Tapani and fellow A's minor league pitcher Wally Whitehurst move to the New York Mets, starter Bob Welch and reliever Matt Young move from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the A's, minor league pitcher Jack Savage go from the Dodgers to the New York Mets, shortstop Alfredo Griffin and closer Jay Howell move from the A's to the Dodgers, and reliever Jesse Orosco go from the Mets to the Dodgers. Following the trade, Tapani was again sent to single-A to start the 1988 season, but after three starts with the St. Lucie Mets in which he only allowed three earned runs in 19 innings, he was promoted to the Double-A Jackson Mets, where he went 5-1 in 24 appearances, including five starts. As fellow future Twin Rick Aguilera would see in his own climb to the major leagues, with no openings in the 1988 Mets starting rotation of Dwight Gooden, Bob Ojeda, Sid Fernandez, Ron Darling, and young phenom David Cone, even promising starters were groomed in minor league bullpens since this was the only way to crack the big league pitching staff. In 1989, Tapani went 7-5 with a 3.47 ERA for the Triple-A Tidewater Tides before being called up to the Mets in July. Major league career Tapani made his major league debut on July 4, 1989. He entered the game in the first inning after starter Bob Ojeda had given up eight runs to the Houston Astros while only getting two outs. Thrown into the fire, Tapani completed 4 1/3 innings while giving up two hits and three walks, and only allowing one more run. Over the next four weeks, he would only get into two more games, pitching a total of 7 2/3 innings in relief. On July 31, just prior to the end of the non-waiver trade deadline, Tapani was included in the blockbuster trade that sent 1988 A.L. Cy Young Award winner Frank Viola, who was vocal in his desire to get a big salary increase in free agency, from the Minnesota Twins to the Mets in exchange for major league swingman Rick Aguilera, minor league relievers Tim Drummond and Jack Savage, and phenom starter David West. Tapani was then thrown into the Twins' starting rotation and finished the 1989 season 2-2 with a 3.86 ERA in 32 2/3 innings. After his promising debut, Tapani was made a fixture of the rotation in 1990 and finished the season 12-8 with 4.07 ERA - good enough for fifth place in the AL Rookie of the Year balloting (a distant 131 votes behind the winner, Cleveland Indians' catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. He would follow up his rookie season with perhaps his best overall season in 1991, finishing 16-9 with only 40 walks and 135 strikeouts in 244 innings with 2.99 ERA - his lowest and only sub-3.00 ERA of his career. He then garnered enough Cy Young votes to finish a distant seventh behind winner Roger Clemens and teammates Scott Erickson and Jack Morris, who finished second and fourth respectively; he also won the 1991 World Series with the Twins. Over his seven seasons with the Twins, Tapani was a workhorse starter for the Twins, who averaged more than 13 wins and over 200 innings in his five full seasons. After suffering through three poor seasons (the beginning of what would be eight consecutive losing seasons) and looking at losing the soon to be free agent Tapani after the 1995 season, the Twins traded him on July 31 to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ron Coomer, Chris Latham, Jos√© Parra, and Greg Hansell. After finishing 4-2 down the stretch for the Dodgers, Tapani pitched in Game 3 against the Cincinnati Reds in the National League Divisional series and gave up three runs and four walks in 1/3 of an inning in relief of starter Hideo Nomo in a 10-1 loss that capped off the Reds' 3-0 sweep. After being granted free agency in December 1995, Tapani signed a one-year contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 3, 1996 and turned in another typical \\"Tapani\\" season for the Sox - finishing 13-10 with a 4.59 ERA and 150 strikeouts in 225 1/3 innings. After again being granted free agency following the 1996 season, Tapani moved across town and signed a five-year contract with the Cubs on December 13. On July 20, 1998 while playing for the Cubs, Tapani had perhaps the most memorable day of his career. Throwing eight innings against the Braves, he allowed three runs and topped it off by hitting a third inning grand slam off former Twins teammate Denny Neagle in an 11-4 romp over the Atlanta Braves. Tapani played his last game on September 27, 2001. His career record: 143 wins, 125 losses, and an ERA of 4.35. In 1998 with the Chicago Cubs, Tapani earned his best record of 19-9, though his ERA was 4.85. In 1991, with the Twins, Tapani had his lowest ERA of 2.99 to go with a 16-9 record and seventh place in the 1991 Cy Young Award voting. Personal life After retirement, Tapani returned to his home in Minnetonka, Minnesota to live with his wife, Sharon, and three children, Sarah (b 1991), Ryan (b 1994), and Luke (b 1996). In 1999, Tapani was elected as a member of the Central Michigan Athletics Hall of Fame. He has been involved with little league and youth baseball since his retirement including coaching both of his sons' teams. Currently Kevin is a high school baseball coach at Providence Academy in Plymouth, Minnesota.

Some scholars believe that the city was founded by the Norman Bohemond of Hauteville ( 1050 - 1111 AD), son of Robert Guiscard, who, to satisfy his love of hunting, ordered the construction of a square tower, which still exists today. The small village originally grew in the late Middle Ages when the Normans ensured security from the constant attacks of the Saracens. This relative calm gave the opportunity to develop Sanvitesi trade, and to dominate the surrounding territory. It was in the 15th century that the town was organized as a commune, though feudal servitude continued. The commune belonged to the Altavilla, then to the Sambiase, then Raymond Orsini of the Balzo and then the Dentice Frasso. From the 15th century onwards, the city began to widen, extending north and east. In 1484 it was sacked by the Venetians. In 1571, during the Crusades, a handful of Sanvitesi took part in the Battle of Lepanto against the Ottoman Empire. In honor of the victory won, they built the Basilca Santa Maria della Vittoria and then dedicated it to the Madonna della Vittoria. In 1799 it joined the Neapolitan Republic; the population during the 19th century the city was the seat of various participating circles to the Carbonari.A. Chionna, Beni Culturali di San Vito dei Normanni, Fasano 1988 During the Fascist period it experienced remarkable urban development. There were many important buildings built such as The Circle Elementary School, the seat of the Municipality, and the post office. In 1927, the province of Brindisi was established which includes San VitoI. In 1943, it hosted King Victor Emmanuel III which was trying to escape to liberation, with Marshal Pietro Badoglio‚Äôs government. In the early 1960s, the petrochemical industry in addition to engineering companies and Aeronavali of Brindisi San Vito have moved many workers from working the fields to the assembly line. The opening of the San Vito dei Normanni Air Station into a strategic focal point during the Cold War, simultaneously created the work between the locals and received thousands of American workers. It closed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Today San Vito is marketing to develop tourism.Statuto comunale Main sights =Religious architecture= Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria Santa Maria della Vittoria, simply called the \\"Mother Church\\", is the most important religious building in the city. The largest church in the city shows evidence of previous wars from the fist-sized holes that can be seen in and around the exterior. Built in the shape of a Latin cross with three naves, a transept and a deep chancel. Inside valuable paintings such as the icon of Nicopeia, depicting the Virgin Mary, announcing to Pope Pius V the victory over the Turks, and a silver statue representing St. Vitus.AAVV, Citt√† e Paesi di Puglia e Basilicata, Gazzetta Del Mezzogiorno On the right side of the basilica there is the Holy Door, opened in October 1995 during celebrations for the fourth centenary of the church, beginning at the Holy Year Jubilee of the Church. Also the occasion was marked by the presentation of a new wooden altar, together all the furnishings of the sanctuary, of Flavio Pancheri. On October 26, 1996, Pope John Paul II, during a special audience called on the Archdiocese of Brindisi- Ostuni, and solemnly crowned the icon of Our Lady Nicopeia. The pope proclaimed the church a papal Basilica on December 30, 1998. Leonardo Leo Piazza Church of San Giovanni Evangelista St. John the Evangelist is a church in Baroque style. The fa√ßade, with four pilasters with Corinthian capitals are in Lecce stone, which is very soft, allowing for striking decorations. In the church there are six paintings, two of which placed in a wooden structure which includes frame and canopy, the other four are on the sidewalls. The church, was \\"sold\\" by the Dentice Frasso family of the symbolic sum of 10,000 lira to the City of San Vito.V. Cazzato - S. Politano, Topografia di Puglia: Atlante dei ‚Äúmonumenti‚Äú trigonometrici; chiese, castelli, torri, fari, architetture rurali, Congedo editore, Galatina, 2001 Chiesa Santa Maria degli Angeli The \\"Old Church\\" was built around the 15th century. Subsequent modifications took place in 1696 and 1763. It has a simple fa√ßade, marked by six pilasters with an elegant portal and an oval window with projecting cornices. In its interior are side altars of stone, an altar in polychrome marble, a wood crucifix from the 16th century and an 1809 painting made by Domenico Carella. Church of Santa Maria della Mercede \\"The church of St. Francis\\" dates back to 1735 and was commissioned by Prince Fabio Marchese Belprato. At the end of the 19th century, with the arrival of Mercedarian Order, there was installed a significantly larger cupola, sanctuary and adjoining convent. The fa√ßade has four pilasters with Ionic capitals, two niches in which there are statues of Our Lady of Mercy and St. Francis of Paola. Inside are chandeliers in wrought iron and the statue, in wood, of St. Francis. Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie The \\"Monastery\\" is so named because until 1868, it was next to the convent of the Franciscan Friars Minor. It was built in 1586, at the behest of Prince Palagano Lucius II, with a single aisle. Then, with a subsequent action in 1700, it was added a second, and in 1898 a third. The fa√ßade is very simple, and has only two windows in the portal and central. In the interior, there are nine altars in the side stones and paintings depicting the Crucifixion. Moreover, in the aisles, there is the Piet√† by an unknown author, the Providence and San Salvador from Orte by local artist Giacomo da San Vito. Church of the Annunciation Also called the Church of San Domenico, due to the presence of the nearby convent of the Dominicans until 1809. The church was built around 1584 on land donated by a devotee. It has a cusp fa√ßade with two side pilasters, window and central portal by a local sculptor. In 1984 the collapse of two aisles caused the closure for restoration work that lasted a decade. Today, reconstructed, it has reopened for worship and there restored the six side stone altars of the 18th century and a tapestry from 1769 depicting the Annunciation by artist Domenico Carella. Church of San Michele Arcangelo Built in 1928 by Concetta Carlucci, who in a vision was invited to awaken the worship of the saint in the city. The structure is very simple, has been enriched by a bronze portal surmounted by a lunette with a bas-relief depicting St. Michael the Archangel, by the sculptor Cosimo Giuliano Latiano and a statue depicting Concetta Carlucci. Other churches *Church of Santa Maria della Piet√†, also called \\"Church of the Hospital\\" *Church of Santa Rita *Church of Santa Teresa Rock settlements There are many rock art sites within San Vito made by Byzantine monks that fled from eastern Europe as they were persecuted because of their faith. Such sites include: St. Nicholas *San Biagio, which is located near the Jannuzzo farm, is a monastic Byzantine sanctuary placed in real rock. The Orthodox rite is drawn inside a cave. It also presents the cells intended for monks, but over time has undergone significant transformations. Like all churches carved out along the last stretch of the Via Francigena, the sanctuary of San Biagio presents votive frescoes dedicated to Saint Blaise, St. Nicholas, St. Andrew, St. George, St. James and St. John. The inscriptions on the iconography, are all in Greek except one, that of St. Nicholas, which sets in Latin as a sign of religious unity between the Orthodox Church and the Latin Church. *St. Nicholas in the San Nicola-Malpasso is located halfway between San Vito and Serranova. The crypt and the four adjoining caves are located in a small valley, partly carved in rock, partly built in tuff. Inside is the image of St. Nicholas and traces of frescoes can be seen in the walls of tufa. *Crypt of San Giovanni is a settlement with several rock caves, some partially collapsed, in which two small cells were found with traces of graffiti. Another, almost completely underground, is divided into seven side branches that converge into a central corridor. The crypt presents a pillar around which rests three arcs. Parts of frescoes, dating back presumably to the 13th century, are in the central apse. *Crypt of St Mary the hamlet of St. James is situated in an old farmhouse, which was abandoned in the 15th century. Inside the church has a fresco of the Virgin with Child. =Civil architecture= The Rezze Rezza (from Retia in Latin, meaning network), is a type of shade used to protect houses' front doors mostly from direct sunlight but also from rain and wind. Rezze are made by thin plates of wood placed horizontally and parallel to each other, with few millimeters between one another. These shades are usually either purple, green, yellow, brown or beige. A traditional expression from San Vito is \\"vecchia cretu la rezza\\", literally meaning \\"older woman behind the shade\\" but indeed referring to someone who likes to spy on others without being seen.R. De Vita (a cura di), Castelli, torri ed opere fortificate di Puglia, Editoriale Adda, Bari, 1974 =Archaeological sites= In the 1990s, just outside the town, specifically in Contrada Castello d'Alceste, traces of buildings dating back to Iron Age and, following excavations, a large Messapii settlement presumably dating from the period between the 7th and 4th centuries BC were found. That site could become the first Archeodromo of Italy. The archaeological site was the subject of several excavations made by the City Council of San Vito dei Normanni, the Archaeological Superintendence of Taranto and the University of Salento's Department of Cultural Heritage. Bohemond of Hauteville =Military architecture= Castle of Dentice Frasso The medieval castle of Dentice Frasso, opposite the Town Hall with its ancient square tower, overlooks the main town‚Äôs piazza. The original access was via a drawbridge which was from the box located on the door of the Chapel The first building was undoubtedly the tower, believed to be Norman and dating from the 12th century. Built by Bohemond of Hauteville in the 11th century, in a strategic position on the road that passed through the hamlet of San Vito and came to the old road for Oria. It is perfectly intact, still dominates the area of San Vito. The tower has Guelphs and Ghibellines-like battlements and narrow openings that allows indoor lighting. There is a large courtyard that overlooks the cinquecento residence, characterized by a series of elegant rectangular boxes around the tower. The castle was probably built originally as the residence of hunters, as once the territory of San Vito completely covered by forests. The entrance to the building consists of a pointed arch, on top is placed a crest of the Dentice family. The stairway leads to a stone porch column, on which rest three round arches. Inside retains decorated suites, paintings, hunting trophies and the town archive. The castle is privately owned and inhabited by descendants of the Dentice Frasso family. =Natural areas= Villa Comunale The only green space of the city is the Villa Comunale, called the Pinewood due to the presence of large marine pines, and also many palm trees. The park is at the center of the city and surrounds the primary school. Countryside A few kilometers from the city is Torre Guaceto (Guaceto Tower), a World Wildlife Fund nature reserve of the State whose extension is approximately and a sea front which stretches for about 8,000 mt. The marine area is represented by a perfect rectangle, with an average depth of 3,000 meters, crossed and divided by State Road 379. The reserve can be visited only on foot or by bicycle. Society =Demographic evolution= The demographic balance the municipality as of March 31, 2008 has 19,915 inhabitants, is as follows: 10,365 females and 9452 males. 7274 families the average family component is 2.7 (higher than the national average of 2.5, but less to the corresponding value of the region that instead of 2.8). The town, like many towns of Apulia experienced a slight decrease in population due to the decrease in part by birth rate which is matched by the fact that many young people decide to complete their university studies in a city in central-north especially Milan, Bologna and Rome.M. R. Muratore, Guida del Salento 2, Congedo Editore, Galatina, 1997 Migrations San Vito was the subject of extensive emigration during the 20th century, first to the Americas, later towards northern Europe (especially Germany) and to northwestern Italy, but today the town has become a destination for immigrants from outside the European Union. A phenomenon that, at least for a decade now, seems to settle into the territory is that of immigration by families from northern Europe, especially English and Irish people. These new arrivals usually consist of pensioners, not coming to work, who buy villas in the countryside of San Vito and enjoy the pleasant temperatures all year. This phenomenon, relatively recent in Apulia, is known as \\"Salentoshire\\", a playful neologism along the lines of \\"Chiantishire\\", which refers to the consolidated British tourism in Tuscany. =Dialect= The Sanvitese is a Brindisi dialect belonging to the southern extreme Salento family. Some Sanvitese idioms include: *Figghiu mutu la mamma lu ntendi. (The mother understands her mute child) *Ccugghimu li fierri.. (Take up the tools of the trade - taking what belongs to us and we go on) *Ci eti veru ca lu munnu gira, casa mea prima o ppoi av√† passai ti quai (if it is true that the world turns, my house sooner or later, must pass by here) *Ci unu nasci cu la capu tunna, no ppo mur√¨ cu la capu quatrata (literally: if a person is born with a round head, it certainly will not die with a square head, figuratively speaking, if a person is made in a certain way, they will remain so until his death) =The 'nciuria= The 'nciuria is the nickname that has a valence of mockery and is given to the inhabitants of any Salento town by the inhabitants of nearby towns. The nickname of San Vito is \\"mulacchiuni\\" that is \\"big mules\\". The reason for the 'nciuria is due to Sanvitesi attitude to differences, news and ideas. They tend to remain stubborn on their ideas, even denying the evidence. Like mules, the Sanvitese would have the blinders that are looking only forward, without further nuances or points of view. Culture =Education= Libraries *John XXIII Biblioteca Comunale is the city‚Äôs first public library, founded by Dominican friars. They possessed thousands of leather- bound books and sorted into nine large closets. Since 1809 the monks left the monastery and many works were lost. In 1946, Mayor Vincenzo Trizza appointed a committee to create a new library. They donated 750 volumes and ordered 450 books of classics, two encyclopedias, and books by fellow authors. In 1962, the present library was founded through the efforts of Professor Angelo Pagliara, who sent letters to the highest offices of State and the Catholic Church to request materials. Pope John XXIII was the first to respond and gave three volumes of his speeches with handwritten signatures and, therefore, the library took name. *St. Benedict Public Library, founded in 1940, is located in the convent of Benedictine Oblates of St. Scholastica but is open to the public. It features about 26,000 volumes and pamphlets and specializes in Biblical, Theology, Patristics, and Ecumenism in the history of the Church. Schools The city has four primary schools: Lanza del Vasto, Monsignor Francesco Passante, Don Lorenzo Milani, Viale Libert√†; one first level secondary school, Meo-Buonsanto; and two second level secondary schools: Liceo Scientifico Leonardo Leo and Professional Institute for Social Services. Rural Museum The Rural Museum implemented by local action group Altosalento, was inaugurated on July 21, 2001 and is currently managed by the Cultural Association AXAS Onlus. The museum, like the town library, is located within the cloister of the Dominicans. The museum houses a remarkable collection of objects and tools that bear witness to everyday rural life between the 18th century and the early 1950s. The tools cover artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, saddlers, knife grinders, shoemakers and of course farmers. Castello d'Alceste Museum In the Contrada Castello d'Alceste were found traces of a village huts in the second half of the 8th century BC. It overlaps the 6th century BC buildings, reflecting the surge of new construction techniques and a new way to conceive of living space. The houses of this period are divided into multiple environments and have complex roof systems that make use of tiles. =Media= *Web TV: Web TV Puntonet *Radio: Teleradio San Vito. *Press: **Il Punto (eng: The Point): monthly **L'Arcobaleno (eng: The Rainbow): bimonthly **Occhio Magazine (eng: Eye Magazine) (monthly). =Music= Tarantism in San Vito Tarantism (a type of Tarantella) blends pagan and Christian tradition. In the past it was believed, that women who showed forms of hysteria, were infected by the bite of the tarantula. The only known remedy was to dance continuously for days, so that the poison did not take effect. Through music and dance to give healing to taranta (the tarantula bitten), creating a real exorcism of musical character. Each time a tarantata exhibiting symptoms associated with Taranto, the drummers, fiddlers, mandolin, guitarists and accordionists went in the house of taranta and stakeholders to play the music from at a frantic pace. Now the Tarantismo dance and sing for hours until they are exhausted. The belief, that while their energies were consumed in the dance, even the tarantula is consumed and destroyed. San Vito retains a remarkable tradition of pinches that, unlike that of Lecce, appears free as a therapeutic repertoire and musical found only in this town. In the 1950s at least thirty players could be involved in the care of the tarantati. =Cuisine= Mustazzueli The sanvitese cucina is characterized by local traditional agricultural products. Local cuisine includes stuffed aubergines (maranciani chini), and traditional specialities made with mashed broad beans mixed with and vegetables (favi e fogghi). Other traditional dishes include \\"frise\\", round shaped hard bread soaked in water and topped with salt, with cherry tomatoes, olive oil and oregano and \\"gnummarieddi\\" or \\"turcinieddi\\", meat skewers made with lamb's innards. Sweets include the mustazzueli, chocolate dolcetti, sweet Cartedd√†te, Christmas cakes in the shape of thin pastry rosettes fried in hot oil, the cupeta cake with almonds, and very soft pettole balls of dough fried in hot oil. The municipality is a member of the olive oil coalition Collina di Brindisi and the wine coalition called Appia wines, which also includes the municipalities of Brindisi, Ostuni, Latiano and Mesagne. Almond milk is achieved by creating in an infusion of water with finely chopped almonds, and then squeezing them to bring out all the juice. Puglia Region has entered the almond milk in the list of traditional Italian food products. Limoncello is a liquor made from the peel of fresh lemon and enriched with water, sugar and alcohol to be enjoyed both as an ap√©ritif and as a digestive after meals. Wine The territory of San Vito produces wines such as the Aleatico di Puglia Doc, Doc Ostuni, Puglia IGT. Along the road of the municipality, there are indigenous varieties of grapes, the Negroamaro, Primitivo, and Malvasia, which have been joined over the years by crops of white grape vines. Malvasia Nera di Brindisi is a grape of Greek origin and now widespread in most Mediterranean countries. Its wine, called Malmsey in English, is sweet with a golden hue. In Italy its cultivation has spread from Piedmont to Puglia. Vinified properly, it can also make a dry white wine. Sangiovese is a red grape variety, among the most widespread in Italy. Negroamaro Novoli vine that also called \\"tears\\", has a special ability to produce rose to its chemical characteristics. Ottavianello leaves are pentagonal green, smooth, opaque and the lower surface light green.

Geography anthropogenic The city originally developed around the Dentice Frasso castle; the old town that still retains the old urban structure of low buildings and small streets. During the 1970s, San Vito experienced a second major urban development with the creation of the ‚Äúzone 167‚Äù north of the city. This neighborhood is home to many condominiums, but also has residences and villas. Neighborhoods include Li stratoddi / Center, Chianti, Gallo / Iaddu, San Franciscu / San Francis, Santa Rita, Area 167, and Zona PIP. Economy San Vito dei Norman is primarily a center of agriculture and trade. The level of employment is above the provincial average. =Agriculture= As for the primary sector, livestock is not well developed with herds of cattle and sheep. Instead the agriculture industry relies on a thousand small and medium entrepreneurs engaged in intensive cultivation of fruits, vegetables, almonds and especially olives (Olea europea). =Craft and industry= Industry in the territory is present with 250 industrial companies and 17.96% of the workforce. The manufacturing sectors are agro-processing (like artichokes), but also mechanical, textile, packaging and wood processing companies. =Services and Tourism= The activity of the service sector, is the fastest growing, with 17.22% of the employed labor force, found primarily in services of transportation and storage businesses, as well as real estate agents. Employment is now reduced in public administration because of the closure of the U.S. military base in the past. Lately, important experiments are being tried in tourism, allowing the industry to grow from year to year. Unfortunately the leak of education in the population and the bad organization of the city hall make the city, especially the surrounding areas, a real open air dump with trashes of different types in the side streets and the fields. Even the roads have not maintains, making sure that many of these are unusable even by garbage collectors. In addition, we often find corpses of animals on the side of the streets given by the large amount of annual abandonment of pets. Infrastructure and Roads The main road links are represented by *A14 Bologna - Taranto: known as Bari-Lecce Highway. *SS 16 connects San Vito dei Normans to Carovigno and Ostuni. *Brindisi-Lecce expressway connects San Vito dei Normans through the SS 16. *Brindisi-Taranto connects San Vito dei Normanni to Taranto through the provincial roads 48, 45 and 44. =Railways= The station in San Vito dei Normanni, served by the Adriatic railway, is currently active with passenger service, but it served by only a few regional trains. The station is located ten kilometres () from the city. The legend says that at the time of construction of the railroad, the prince did not want the \\"new infernal machine\\" to pass on its territories. The local service stations is ensured by the ESF in Ceglie Messapica and Francavilla Fontana.

Since 1994, it attracts thousands of reggae fans from all over the world, thanks to a vast cultural and musical program that lasts for up to ten days. History =1991-1999: Rototom Association and the clubs in Gaio and Zoppola= The birthplace of the festival is the small Italian town of Gaio di Spilimbergo, province of Pordenone, in the region of Friuli Venezia Giulia, close to Venice. On 13 December 1991, the Rototom Cultural Association was born and with it a nightclub of the same name. It was an alternative music scene showcasing various styles from punk rock to reggae, indie, and electronic music. The name was taken from the rototom drum, and ascribed to the fact that like the drum, the club creates a variety of sounds. In 1997, the club moved to the municipality of Zoppola in the same province. At this point, the Rototom Club was divided into three rooms, each playing different genres of music: rock, pop, and rap in one; another played reggae and African music; and the last one dedicated to electronic music. Over the next nine years, the club hosted performances by the Ramones (1993), Massive Attack (1998), Bad Religion, NOFX, Suede, and Soulfly; legends like the father of Afrobeat, Fela Kuti, and reggae greats such as Burning Spear, Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, Inner Circle, U-Roy, Yellowman, Itals, The Meditations, Junior Reid, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Misty in Roots, The Gladiators (band), Pablo Moses, Shaggy (musician), and Buju Banton, among many others. =1994: Rototom Sunsplash is born= The Rototom Sunsplash festival was born as a self-financed project at the Rototom club in 1994. The name Sunsplash was taken from what was then the world‚Äôs biggest reggae event, Reggae Sunsplash, held annually in Jamaica since 1978, and discontinued in 1998. The event lasted the entire weekend of July 2 and 3, with a lineup of 14 artists, including Africa Unite, Almamegretta, and Buju Banton. The first edition of the festival attracted a thousand people, mostly musicians and producers. In addition, a dedicated radio station was created, called Radio Rototom. The second year, the event attracted 3,000 festivalgoers in two days, and the numbers continued to increase during the third and fourth editions. In 1998, the festival relocated to Latisana, due to larger audience numbers and the need for a bigger space. =1998-1999: Latisana= In the summer of 1998, unable to accommodate the number of people attending the festival, the organizers decided to move it to Latisana Marittima, in the province of Udine. At this point, Rototom Sunsplash became a proper outdoor festival, with three stages and complementary cultural areas capable of absorbing thousands of attendees. From the previous year's 8,000, audience numbers grew to 20,000 in 1998. The event stretched to four days, with more acts and sideshows than ever before. For the first time, the festival was broadcast internationally via live stream on Italy's Arcoiris TV. It was also here that the \\"Italian Reggae Awards\\" were first organized. The director of the Jamaican Reggae Sunsplash, Rae Barret, was invited to choose from the best Italian bands at the festival, in order to become the first group to represent Italy at the festival in Jamaica. Reggae National Tickets took the honour that year, and this launched the solo career of Alborosie, the band's vocalist. =2000-2009: Osoppo= In the summer of 2000, Rototom Sunsplash moved its headquarters once more, this time to Osoppo. This move was crucial to the festival's growth from an Italian musical celebration to a major European event. Within the 250,000 m2 of the Rivellino Park in Osoppo, the festival assumed the dimensions that it retains to the present. The duration of the festival was first extended to eight days, then later nine and finally ten days in total. An average of 150,000 people from around the world converged on this small Italian town for ten consecutive editions. Apart from a greater number of musical stages than ever before, the festival now included numerous side events and workshops, including conferences; capoeira, percussion, and African dance lessons; spaces for meditation; as well as areas with creative workshops for children. Rototom Sunsplash continued to fund itself solely through ticket sales, with a complete absence of commercial sponsors, and by 2003, almost a decade after its launch, the festival had zero debt. Beginning in 2006, the festival began to receive criticism as well as some opposition from several Italian politicians after the adoption of the Fini-Giovanardi law, declared unconstitutional in 2014, which, among other things, proposed up to ten years in prison for the use of recreational drugs such as cannabis inside spaces with leisure and cultural activities. The law essentially criminalized the event ‚Äîthough it was cleared in 2015‚Äî to the point that it was forced to move from Italy to Spain. =2010-present: Benic√†ssim= In 2010, Rototom Sunsplash moved one more time, to its current location, the beach resort town of Benic√†ssim in Spain. After the final event in Osoppo on 12 July 2009, the festival organizers went in search of a new venue. After seven months of touring various regions of Spain, in February 2010, an agreement was reached with the city of Benic√†ssim, on the eastern coast of the Iberian nation. The extensive camping area made available for the event was key to the decision. The town of less than 20,000 people in the province of Castell√≥n hosted the 17th edition of Rototom Sunsplash, and has been the festival's home to this day. The number of people attending the newly-relocated event increased with the space, to an average of 230,000 people per edition. The festival was no longer just a European attraction; fans from all over the world were attending, and the Spanish-speaking venue was especially a draw for reggae aficionados from Latin-American countries. Another major selling point for the festival was its new beach location, providing a sharp contrast to its previous Alpine setting, which was usually colder and often windy and rainy. Criticism and controversy * Berliner Zeitung has criticized the fact that the festival offers, apart from its musical attractions, a questionable cultural program with a ‚Äúcrude mixture of enthusiasm for Africa, anti-imperialism, and esotericism‚Äù. For example, a discussion on the dangers of chemtrails has been listed on the festival's \\"social forum\\". * In August 2015, the festival took the political stance of disinviting the American reggae artist Matisyahu after he refused to state his personal opinion regarding the proposed two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Matisyahu is not Israeli, but he is Jewish. Matisyahu stated that he never includes his own political views in his shows, and he declined to clarify his previous statements on the topic. It was also reported that other musicians threatened to cancel their performances unless Matisyahu made a declaration supporting Palestinian statehood. Many human rights groups and the Spanish government suggested that the banning had anti- Semitic overtones. The Spanish foreign minister said: \\"Imposing a public declaration (from Matisyahu), puts into question the principle of non- discrimination on which all plural and diverse societies are based\\".Spanish music festival reinvites Matisyahu after anti-Semitism backlash The concert had also included singer Capleton, whose lyrics call for the murder of gays and lesbians, and who had not been disinvited.Spanish Officials Condemn Matisyahu Concert Cancellation After strong reactions from various critics and accusations of anti-Semitism, Rototom Sunsplash admitted that cancelling Matisyahu's performance had been the wrong decision. The artist was then reinvited to the festival.Spanish reggae festival re-invites Matisyahu In an official statement issued on their web page, Rototom Sunplash said: \\"Rototom Sunsplash rejects anti-Semitism and any form of discrimination towards the Jewish community; we respect both their culture and religious beliefs and we sincerely apologize for what has occurred\\". *Within the context of the Matisyahu controversy, Jungle World pointed out the irony that \\"in a festival with a strong focus on human rights\\", the violent, homophobic lyrics of Capleton have not been called out by anyone.

The bridge opened on March 27, 1928, following a vehicle parade from the southern suburbs of the city, which crossed the Smithfield Street Bridge and proceeded through downtown before ending at the southern end of the new bridge. It was designed by George S. Richardson and cost $3,456,000 to build. It is 2663' 3/16\\" long, though the main span is 448' and the water clearance is 44.4'. It was renovated in 1982 by the Dick Corporation, at a cost of $32 million. Fire On September 2, 2016 the Liberty Bridge was closed for 24 days, following a fire during construction work on the bridge.

In this photo, only one driver is mounted. A cabinet with loudspeakers mounted in the holes. Number 1 is a mid-range driver. Number 2 is a high-range driver. Number 3 indicates two low-frequency woofers. Below the bottom woofer is a bass reflex port. A loudspeaker enclosure or loudspeaker cabinet is an enclosure (often box-shaped) in which speaker drivers (e.g., loudspeakers and tweeters) and associated electronic hardware, such as crossover circuits and, in some cases, power amplifiers, are mounted. Enclosures may range in design from simple, homemade DIY rectangular particleboard boxes to very complex, expensive computer-designed hi-fi cabinets that incorporate composite materials, internal baffles, horns, bass reflex ports and acoustic insulation. Loudspeaker enclosures range in size from small \\"bookshelf\\" speaker cabinets with 4\\" woofers and small tweeters designed for listening to music with a hi- fi system in a private home to huge, heavy subwoofer enclosures with multiple 18\\" or even 21\\" speakers in huge enclosures which are designed for use in stadium concert sound reinforcement systems for rock music concerts. The primary role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves generated by the rearward-facing surface of the diaphragm of an open speaker driver interacting with sound waves generated at the front of the speaker driver. Because the forward- and rearward-generated sounds are out of phase with each other, any interaction between the two in the listening space creates a distortion of the original signal as it was intended to be reproduced. As such, a loudspeaker cannot be used without installing it in a cabinet of some type, or mounting it into a wall or ceiling. Additionally, because the sound waves would travel different paths through the listening space, the sound waves in an unmounted speaker would arrive at the listener's position at slightly different times, introducing echo and reverberation effects not part of the original sound. The enclosure also plays a role in managing vibration induced by the driver frame and moving airmass within the enclosure, as well as heat generated by driver voice coils and amplifiers (especially where woofers and subwoofers are concerned). Sometimes considered part of the enclosure, the base, may include specially designed \\"feet\\" to decouple the speaker from the floor. Enclosures designed for use in PA systems, sound reinforcement systems and for use by electric musical instrument players (e.g., bass amp cabinets) have a number of features to make them easier to transport, such as carrying handles on the top or sides, metal or plastic corner protectors, and metal grilles to protect the speakers. Speaker enclosures designed for use in a home or recording studio typically do not have handles or corner protectors, although they do still usually have a cloth or mesh cover to protect the woofer and tweeter. These speaker grilles are a metallic or cloth mesh that are used to protect the speaker by forming a protective cover over the speaker's cone while allowing sound to pass through undistorted. Speaker enclosures are used in homes in stereo systems, home cinema systems, televisions, boom boxes and many other audio appliances. Small speaker enclosures are used in car stereo systems. Speaker cabinets are key components of a number of commercial applications, including sound reinforcement systems, movie theatre sound systems and recording studios. Electric musical instruments invented in the 20th century, such as the electric guitar, electric bass and synthesizer, among others, are amplified using instrument amplifiers and speaker cabinets (e.g., guitar amplifier speaker cabinets).  History  Early on, radio loudspeakers consisted of horns, often sold separately from the radio itself, (typically a small wood box containing the radio's electronic circuitsIllustrations Retrieved November 26, 2012.), so they were not usually housed in an enclosure.Illustrations , Retrieved November 26, 2012. When paper cone loudspeaker drivers were introduced in the mid 1920s, radio cabinets began to be made larger to enclose both the electronics and the loudspeaker.Illustrations Retrieved November 26, 2012. These cabinets were made largely for the sake of appearance, with the loudspeaker simply mounted behind a round hole in the cabinet. It was observed that the enclosure had a strong effect on the bass response of the speaker. Since the rear of the loudspeaker radiates sound out of phase from the front, there can be constructive and destructive interference for loudspeakers without enclosures, and below frequencies related to the baffle dimensions in open-baffled loudspeakers (described in Background section, below). This results in a loss of bass and comb filtering (i.e. response peaks and dips in power regardless of the signal meant to be reproduced). A Lansing Iconic multicell horn loudspeaker from 1937. Before the 1950s many manufacturers did not fully enclose their loudspeaker cabinets; the back of the cabinet was typically left open. This was done for several reasons, not least because electronics (at that time tube equipment) could be placed inside and cooled by convection in the open enclosure. Most of the enclosure types discussed in this article were invented either to wall off the out of phase sound from one side of the driver, or to modify it so that it could be used to enhance the sound produced from the other side. However, a few designs have ventured in a different direction, attempting to incorporate the natural acoustic properties of the cabinet material rather than deaden it, and shape the cabinet so that the rear can remain open and still provide good bass response with limited comb filtering.Auditorium 23 , Retrieved November 26, 2012.  Background  Medium density fiberboard is a common material out of which loudspeaker enclosures are built. In some respects, the ideal mounting for a low-frequency loudspeaker driver would be a rigid flat panel of infinite size with infinite space behind it. This would entirely prevent the rear sound waves from interfering (i.e., comb filter cancellations) with the sound waves from the front. An \\"open baffle\\" loudspeaker is an approximation of this, since the driver is mounted on a panel, with dimensions comparable to the longest wavelength to be reproduced. In either case, the driver would need a relatively stiff suspension to provide the restoring force which might have been provided at low frequencies by a smaller sealed or ported enclosure, so few drivers are suitable for this kind of mounting. The forward- and rearward- generated sounds of a speaker driver appear out of phase from each other because they are generated through opposite motion of the diaphragm and because they travel different paths before converging at the listener's position. A speaker driver mounted on a finite baffle will display a physical phenomenon known as interference which can result in a perceivable frequency- dependent sound attenuation. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable at low frequencies where the wavelengths are large enough that interference will affect the entire listening area. Since infinite baffles are impractical and finite baffles tend to suffer poor response as wavelengths approach the dimensions of the baffle (i.e. at lower frequencies), most loudspeaker cabinets use some sort of structure (usually a box) to contain the out of phase sound energy. The box is typically made of wood, wood composite, or more recently plastic, for reasons of ease of construction and appearance. Stone, concrete, plaster, and even building structures have also been used. Enclosures can have a significant effect beyond what was intended, with panel resonances, diffraction from cabinet edges and standing wave energy from internal reflection/reinforcement modes being among the possible problems. Bothersome resonances can be reduced by increasing enclosure mass or rigidity, by increasing the damping of enclosure walls or wall/surface treatment combinations, by adding stiff cross bracing, or by adding internal absorption. Wharfedale, in some designs, reduced panel resonance by using two wooden cabinets (one inside the other) with the space between filled with sand. Home experimenters have even designed speakers built from concrete, granite and other exotic materials for similar reasons. Many diffraction problems, above the lower frequencies, can be alleviated by the shape of the enclosure, such as by avoiding sharp corners on the front of the enclosure. Research experiments from the 1930s by Dr. Harry F. Olson showed that curved loudspeaker baffles reduce some response deviations due to sound wave diffraction. It was discovered later that careful placement of a speaker on a sharp-edged baffle can reduce diffraction-caused response problems. Sometimes the differences in phase response at frequencies shared by different drivers can be addressed by adjusting the vertical location of the smaller drivers (usually backwards), or by leaning or 'stepping' the front baffle, so that the wavefront from all drivers is coherent at and around the crossover frequencies in the speaker's normal sound field. The acoustic center of the driver dictates the amount of rearward offset needed to \\"time-align\\" the drivers.  Types A small LS3/5A \\"bookshelf speaker\\" with its protective cover removed. Enclosures used for woofers and subwoofers can be adequately modeled in the low-frequency region (approximately 100-200 Hz and below) using acoustics and the lumped component models. Electrical filter theory has been used with considerable success for some enclosure types. For the purposes of this type of analysis, each enclosure must be classified according to a specific topology. The designer must balance low bass extension, linear frequency response, efficiency, distortion, loudness and enclosure size, while simultaneously addressing issues higher in the audible frequency range such as diffraction from enclosure edges, the baffle step effect when wavelengths approach enclosure dimensions, crossovers, and driver blending. = Sealed (or closed) enclosures = A box stuffed with fiberglass insulation to increase the perceived volume of the box. Sealed enclosure. The loudspeaker driver's moving mass and compliance (slackness or reciprocal stiffness of the suspension) determines the driver's resonant frequency (Fs). In combination with the damping properties of the system (both mechanical and electrical) all these factors affect the low-frequency response of sealed-box systems. Output falls below the system's resonant frequency (Fc), defined as the frequency of peak impedance. In a closed-box, the air inside the box acts as a spring, returning the cone to the 'zero' position in the absence of a signal. A significant increase in the effective volume of a sealed-box loudspeaker can be achieved by a filling of fibrous material, typically fiberglass, bonded acetate fiber (BAF) or long-fiber wool. The effective volume increase can be as much as 40% and is due primarily to a reduction in the speed of sound propagation through the filler material as compared to air.L. Beranek, Acoustics, 2nd Ed. 1986. The enclosure or driver must have a small leak so internal and external pressures can equalise over time, to compensate for barometric pressure or altitude; the porous nature of paper cones, or an imperfectly sealed enclosure, is normally sufficient to provide this slow pressure equalisation.  Infinite baffle  A variation on the 'open baffle' approach is to mount the loudspeaker driver in a very large sealed enclosure, providing minimal 'air spring' restoring force to the cone. This minimizes the change in the driver's resonant frequency caused by the enclosure. Some infinite baffle 'enclosures' have used an adjoining room, basement, or a closet or attic. This is often the case with exotic rotary woofer installations, as they are intended to go to frequencies lower than 20 Hertz and displace large volumes of air. \\"Infinite baffle\\" or simply \\"IB\\" is also used as a generic term for sealed enclosures of any size, the name being used because of the ability of a sealed enclosure to prevent any interaction between the forward and rear radiation of a driver at low frequencies. In conceptual terms an infinite baffle is a flat baffle that extends out to infinity ‚Äì the so-called \\"endless plate\\". A genuine infinite baffle cannot be constructed but a very large baffle such as the wall of a room can be considered to be a practical equivalent. A genuine infinite-baffle loudspeaker has an infinite volume (a half-space) on each side of the baffle and has no baffle step. However the term \\"infinite-baffle loudspeaker\\" can fairly be applied to any loudspeaker that behaves (or closely approximates) in all respects as if the drive unit is mounted in a genuine infinite baffle. The term is often and erroneously used of sealed enclosures which cannot exhibit infinite-baffle behavior unless their internal volume is much greater than the Vas Thiele/Small of the drive unit AND the front baffle dimensions are ideally several wavelengths of the lowest output frequency. It is important to distinguish between genuine infinite-baffle topology and so-called infinite- baffle or IB \\"enclosures\\" which may not meet genuine infinite-baffle criteria. The distinction becomes important when interpreting textbook usage of the term.Acoustics, Leo Beranek, 1954 Ed (P118, 1996 print)e.g. The Art of Sound Reproduction, John Watkinson, 2004  Acoustic suspension  Acoustic suspension or air suspension is a variation of the closed-box enclosure, using a box size that exploits the almost linear air spring resulting in 30-40 Hz from a box of only one to two cubic feet or so. The \\"spring\\" suspension that restores the cone to a neutral position is a combination of an exceptionally compliant (soft) woofer suspension, and the air inside the enclosure. At frequencies below system resonance, the air pressure caused by the cone motion is the dominant force. Developed by Edgar Villchur in 1954, this technique was used in the very successful Acoustic Research line of \\"bookshelf\\" speakers in the 1960s-70s. The acoustic suspension principle takes advantage of this relatively linear spring. The enhanced suspension linearity of this type of system is an advantage. For a specific driver, an optimal acoustic suspension cabinet will be smaller than a bass reflex, but the bass reflex cabinet will have a lower -3 dB point. The voltage sensitivity above the tuning frequency remains a function of the driver, and not of the cabinet design.  Isobaric loading  Isobaric loudspeaker in a cone-to-magnet (in-phase) arrangement. The image above shows a sealed enclosure; vented enclosures may also use the isobaric scheme. The isobaric loudspeaker configuration was first introduced by Harry F. Olson in the early 1950s, and refers to systems in which two or more identical woofers (bass drivers) operate simultaneously, with a common body of enclosed air adjoining one side of each diaphragm. In practical applications, they are most often used to improve low-end frequency response without increasing cabinet size, though at the expense of cost and weight. Two identical loudspeakers are coupled to work together as one unit: they are mounted one behind the other in a casing to define a chamber of air in between. The volume of this \\"isobaric\\" chamber is usually chosen to be fairly small for reasons of convenience. The two drivers operating in tandem exhibit exactly the same behavior as one loudspeaker in twice the cabinet. = Ported (or reflex) enclosures =  Bass-reflex  Bass reflex enclosure. RCA shelf stereo bass reflex multi-way speakers. Also known as vented (or ported) systems, these enclosures have a vent or hole cut into the cabinet and a port tube affixed to the hole, to improve low-frequency output, increase efficiency, or reduce the size of an enclosure. Bass reflex designs are used in home stereo speakers (including both low- to mid-priced speaker cabinets and expensive hi-fi cabinets), bass amplifier speaker cabinets, keyboard amplifier cabinets, subwoofer cabinets and PA system speaker cabinets. Vented or ported cabinets use cabinet openings or transform and transmit low- frequency energy from the rear of the speaker to the listener. They deliberately and successfully exploit Helmholtz resonance. As with sealed enclosures, they may be empty, lined, filled or (rarely) stuffed with damping materials. Port tuning frequency is a function of cross-section and length. This enclosure type is very common, and provides more sound pressure level near the tuning frequency than a sealed enclosure of the same volume, though it actually has less low frequency extension since the \\"rolloff\\" is steeper (24db/oct vs. 12db/oct for a sealed enclosure). Malcolm Hill pioneered the use of these designs in a live event context in the early 1970s. Vented system design using computer modeling has been practiced since about 1985, when researchers Thiele and Small first systematically applied electrical filter theory to the acoustic behavior of loudspeakers in enclosures. While ported loudspeakers had been produced for many years before computer modeling, achieving optimum performance was challenging, as it is a complex sum of the properties of the specific driver, the enclosure and port, because of imperfect understanding of the assorted interactions. These enclosures are sensitive to small variations in driver characteristics and require special quality control concern for uniform performance across a production run. Bass ports are widely used in subwoofers for PA systems and sound reinforcement systems, in bass amp speaker cabinets and in keyboard amp speaker cabinets.  Passive radiator  Passive radiator enclosure. A passive radiator speaker uses a second \\"passive\\" driver, or drone, to produce similar low- frequency extension, or efficiency increase, or enclosure size reduction, similar to ported enclosures. The passive driver is not wired to an amplifier; instead, it moves in response to changing enclosure pressures. In theory, such designs are variations of the bass reflex type, but with the advantage of avoiding a relatively small port or tube through which air moves, sometimes noisily. Tuning adjustments for a passive radiator are usually accomplished more quickly than with a bass reflex design since such corrections can be as simple as mass adjustments to the drone. The disadvantages are that a passive radiator requires precision construction somewhat like a driver, thus increasing costs, and has excursion limitations.  Compound or band-pass  Compound or 4th order band-pass enclosure. A 4th order electrical bandpass filter can be simulated by a vented box in which the contribution from the rear face of the driver cone is trapped in a sealed box, and the radiation from the front surface of the cone is directed into a ported chamber. This modifies the resonance of the driver. In its simplest form a compound enclosure has two chambers. The dividing wall between the chambers holds the driver; typically only one chamber is ported. If the enclosure on each side of the woofer has a port in it then the enclosure yields a 6th order band-pass response. These are considerably harder to design and tend to be very sensitive to driver characteristics. As in other reflex enclosures, the ports may generally be replaced by passive radiators if desired. An eighth order bandpass box is another variation which also has a narrow frequency range. They are often used to achieve sound pressure levels in which case a bass tone of a specific frequency would be used versus anything musical. They are complicated to build and must be done quite precisely in order to perform nearly as intended.  Aperiodic enclosures  This design falls between acoustic suspension and bass reflex enclosures. It can be thought of as either a leaky sealed box or a ported box with large amounts of port damping. By setting up a port, and then blocking it precisely with sufficiently tightly packed fiber filling, it's possible to adjust the damping in the port as desired. The result is control of the resonance behavior of the system which improves low-frequency reproduction, according to some designers. Dynaco was a primary producer of these enclosures for many years, using designs developed by a Scandinavian driver maker. The design remains uncommon among commercial designs currently available. A reason for this may be that adding damping material is a needlessly inefficient method of increasing damping; the same alignment can be achieved by simply choosing a loudspeaker driver with the appropriate parameters and precisely tuning the enclosure and port for the desired response. A similar technique has been used in aftermarket car audio; it is called \\"aperiodic membrane\\" (AP). A resistive mat is placed in front of or directly behind the loudspeaker driver (usually mounted on the rear deck of the car in order to use the trunk as an enclosure). The loudspeaker driver is sealed to the mat so that all acoustic output in one direction must pass through the mat. This increases mechanical damping, and the resulting decrease in the impedance magnitude at resonance is generally the desired effect, though there is no perceived or objective benefit to this. Again, this technique reduces efficiency and the same result can be achieved through selection of a driver with a lower Q factor, or even via electronic equalization. This is reinforced by the purveyors of AP membranes; they are often sold with an electronic processor which, via equalization, restores the bass output lost through the mechanical damping. The effect of the equalization is opposite to that of the AP membrane, resulting in a loss of damping and an effective response similar to that of the loudspeaker without the aperiodic membrane and electronic processor. = Dipole enclosures = Dipole speakers and their radiation pattern. A dipole enclosure in its simplest form is a driver located on a flat baffle panel, similar to older open back cabinet designs. The baffle's edges are sometimes folded back to reduce its apparent size, creating a sort of open-backed box. A rectangular cross-section is more common than curved ones since it is easier to fabricate in a folded form than a circular one. The baffle dimensions are typically chosen to obtain a particular low-frequency response, with larger dimensions giving a lower frequency before the front and rear waves interfere with each other. A dipole enclosure has a \\"figure-of-eight\\" radiation pattern, which means that there is a reduction in sound pressure, or loudness, at the sides as compared to the front and rear. This is useful if it can be used to prevent the sound from being as loud in some places as in others. = Horn enclosures = Horn loudspeaker schematic. A horn loudspeaker is a speaker system using a horn to match the driver cone to the air. The horn structure itself does not amplify, but rather improves the coupling between the speaker driver and the air. Properly designed horns have the effect of making the speaker cone transfer more of the electrical energy in the voice coil into the air; in effect the driver appears to have higher efficiency. Horns can help control dispersion at higher frequencies which is useful in some applications such as sound reinforcement. The mathematical theory of horn coupling is well developed and understood, though implementation is sometimes difficult. Properly designed horns for high frequencies are small (above say 3 kHz or so, a few centimetres or inches), those for mid-range frequencies (perhaps 300 Hz to 2 kHz) much larger, perhaps 30 to 60 cm (1 or 2 feet), and for low frequencies (under 300 Hz) very large, a few metres (dozens of feet). In the 1950s, a few high fidelity enthusiasts actually built full sized horns whose structures were built into a house wall or basement. With the coming of stereo (two speakers) and surround sound (four or more), plain horns became even more impractical. Various speaker manufacturers have produced folded low-frequency horns which are much smaller (e.g., Altec Lansing, JBL, Klipsch, Lowther, Tannoy) and actually fit in practical rooms. These are necessarily compromises, and because they are physically complex, they are expensive.  Multiple entry horn  Multiple entry horn. The multiple entry horn (also known as a coentrant horn, unity horn or synergy horn) is a manifold speaker design; it uses several different drivers mounted on the horn at stepped distances from the horn's apex, where the high frequency driver is placed. Depending on implementation, this design offers an improvement in transient response as each of the drivers is aligned in phase and time and exits the same horn mouth. A more uniform radiation pattern throughout the frequency range is also possible.Loudspeaker Profile: Danley Sound Labs SH-50 Live Sound International. May 2006, Volume 15, Number 5. TechTopic. Pat Brown. A uniform pattern allows smooth arraying of multiple enclosures.Danley Sound Labs. A White Paper on Danley Sound Labs Tapped Horn and Synergy Horn Technologies  Tapped horn  Both sides of a long-excursion high-power driver in a tapped horn enclosure are ported into the horn itself, with one path length long and the other short. These two paths combine in phase at the horn's mouth within the frequency range of interest. This design is especially effective at subwoofer frequencies and offers reductions in enclosure size along with more output. = Transmission line = Transmission line enclosure. A perfect transmission line loudspeaker enclosure has an infinitely long line, stuffed with absorbent material such that all the rear radiation of the driver is fully absorbed, down to the lowest frequencies. Theoretically, the vent at the far end could be closed or open with no difference in performance. The density of and material used for the stuffing is critical, as too much stuffing will cause reflections due to back-pressure, whilst insufficient stuffing will allow sound to pass through to the vent. Stuffing often is of different materials and densities, changing as one gets further from the back of the driver's diaphragm. Consequent to the above, practical Transmission Line loudspeakers are not true Transmission Lines, as there is generally output from the vent at the lowest frequencies. They can be thought of as a waveguide in which the structure shifts the phase of the driver's rear output by at least 90¬∞, thereby reinforcing the frequencies near the driver's Fs. Transmission lines tend to be larger than ported enclosures of approximately comparable performance, due to the size and length of the guide required (typically 1/4 the longest wavelength of interest). The design is often described as non-resonant, and some designs are sufficiently stuffed with absorbent material that there is indeed not much output from the line's port. But it is the inherent resonance (typically at 1/4 wavelength) that can enhance the bass response in this type of enclosure, albeit with less absorbent stuffing. Among the first examples of this enclosure design approach were the projects published in Wireless World by Bailey in the early 1970s, and the commercial designs of the now defunct IMF Electronics which received critical acclaim at about the same time. A variation on the transmission line enclosure uses a tapered tube, with the terminus (opening/port) having a smaller area than the throat. The tapering tube can be coiled for lower frequency driver enclosures to reduce the dimensions of the speaker system, resulting in a seashell like appearance. Bose uses similar patented technology on their Wave and Acoustic Waveguide music systems. Numerical simulations by George L. Augspurger and Martin J. King have helped refine the theory and practical design of these systems.Loudspeakers on Damped Pipes. AES E-Library: Augspurger, George L. JAES Volume 48, Issue 5, pp. 424-436. May 2000Quarter Wavelength Loudspeaker Design by Martin J. King. July 17, 2002 (last revised February 25, 2008) = Quarter wave enclosure = A quarter wave resonator is a transmission line tuned to form a standing quarter wave at a frequency somewhat below the driver's frequency FS. When properly designed, a port that is of much smaller diameter than the main pipe located at the end of the pipe then produces the driver's backward radiation in phase with the speaker driver itself; greatly adding to the bass output. Such designs tend to be less dominant in certain bass frequencies than the more common bass reflex designs and followers of such designs claim an advantage in clarity of the bass with a better congruency of the fundamental frequencies to the overtones. Some loudspeaker designers like Martin J. King and Bj√∏rn Johannessen consider the term \\"quarter wave enclosure\\" as a more fitting term for most transmission lines and since acoustically, quarter wavelengths produce standing waves inside the enclosure that are used to produce the bass response emanating from the port. These designs can be considered a mass-loaded transmission line design or a bass reflex design, as well as a quarter wave enclosure. Quarter wave resonators have seen a revival as commercial applications with the onset of neodymium drivers that enable this design to produce relatively low bass extensions within a relatively small speaker enclosure. = Tapered quarter- wave pipe = The tapered quarter-wave pipe (TQWP) is an example of a combination of transmission line and horn effects. It is highly regarded by some speaker designers. The concept is that the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker driver is progressively reflected and absorbed along the length of the tapering tube, almost completely preventing internally reflected sound being retransmitted through the cone of the loudspeaker. The lower part of the pipe acts as a horn while the top can be visualised as an extended compression chamber. The entire pipe can also be seen as a tapered transmission line in inverted form. (A traditional tapered transmission line, confusingly also sometimes referred to as a TQWP, has a smaller mouth area than throat area.) Its relatively low adoption in commercial speakers can mostly be attributed to the large resulting dimensions of the speaker produced and the expense of manufacturing a rigid tapering tube. The TQWP is also known as a Voigt pipe and was introduced in 1934 by Paul G. A. H. Voigt, Lowther's original driver designer.

In his youth, he was well known for his brilliance, excellent character traits and geniality, dubbed the \\"Cracower Illui\\" at age 15 in recognition of his prodigious powers of Talmudic analysis. Rabbi Kreiswirth studied for many years in the famous Torah centers of Poland and Lithuania. Upon application the Rabbi Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva, he was tested by the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Meir Shapiro. Rabbi Shapiro was impressed by Rabbi Kreiswirth's proficiency in all aspects of Torah. Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski as well as rabbi Chanoch Henoch Eigis were very fond of him and gave his sefer on Tractate Zevachim a warm recommendation (the manuscript was lost during the World War II). Rabbi Kreiswirth received Semicha from Rabbi Chanoch Henich Eigess. Second World War With the 1939 German invasion of Poland, Rabbi Kreiswirth fled to Lithuania. In Lithuania, he married the daughter of the Slabodka Mashgiach, Rabbi Avraham Grodzinski. The couple then left via Vilna to Palestine, where he met many famous personalities, including the Brisker Rav, the Chazon Ish, the Steipler, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. Post-World War II At the end of World War II, Rabbi Kreiswirth returned to Poland in an attempt to rescue Jewish children who had been sheltered by the Catholic Church for the war's duration. In 1947, he moved to the United States and from 1947 to 1953 served as Rosh Yeshiva at the Hebrew Theological College in Skokie, Illinois. In 1953 he moved to Antwerp in an effort to rebuild the Jewish community there. This move was against the counsel of the Chazon Ish, and the Amshinover Rebbe. Rabbi Kreiswirth devoted the rest of his life to the Belgian community, became the Av Beth Din and Posek in Antwerp and was active in Agudath Israel. Death Rabbi Kreiswirth died on Sunday 30 December 2001 (16 Tevet 5762 on the Hebrew calendar) shortly before midnight, aged 82, after suffering from an illness. He is buried on Har HaMenuchot. Thousands of people came from all over Europe to participate in the funeral in Antwerp. Among the eulogizers were Dayan Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss and Dayan Elya Sternbuch of Antwerp. The main funeral and burial was held in Jerusalem, where, among many, Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel and Rabbi Kreiswirth's son Rabbi Dov Kreiswirth of Lakewood gave eulogies. In 2015, Rav Dov Kreiswirth shlit\\"a and Rav Zvi Twersky established Yeshivas Toras Chaim in the Romema neighborhood of Jerusalem in Rav Chaim Kreiswirth ZT\\"L's name.

Location The School occupies a large red brick building which was previously a hospital next to the L√ºbeck Cathedral (Dom), this provides it with a very central location within the city. Transport links are very good, being conveniently situated just 75m away from the Fegefeuer bus stop (Haltestelle) which is serviced by the L√ºbeck bus company with routes to all the major suburbs of the city and some nearby villages such as Krummesse. This provides the school with the ability to accept students not solely from the city but also from slightly further a field. Academics and extra-curricular activities Being a Gymnasium the school is extremely academic, with languages and the sciences taking precedence among other subjects. Languages are seen to be essential, with students receiving an average of 4 hours language related study a week, foreign exchanges are therefore also seen as very important within the school and prove to be very popular with the students themselves. Exchanges are conducted annually between the OzD and Adams' Grammar School (a free state Grammar School funded by the Haberdashers Company) in the United Kingdom and the OzD and the Lyc√©e-Coll√®ge de la Planta in French speaking Switzerland.

The game was invented in 2001 by Micael Hellberg, Sweden, and is manufactured by Bex Sport AB in H√∂gan√§s.  Equipment  * 6 black + 6 red balls * 3 black + 3 red blocks of wood * 3 bands ‚Äì 2 black, 1 red * 9 flags * A bag as big as math book to carry all of this in.  Game Instructions  Before you start Look at the diagram and prepare the tournament arena on a fairly even surface (preferably grass). The size of the arena, as shown in the diagram, is for medium level of difficulty. However, the size of the arena can be changed depending on the desired level of difficulty. For example, for easier game play, increase the distance between the three wooden blocks so the risk of knocking down the wrong block is reduced. Choose two teams, the Black Knights and the Red Knights. One team consists of 1 ‚Äì 6 players (it should not be more) and each team receives 6 balls and 3 wooden blocks in their team's colour. The blocks represent two knights and one Lady. Game Setup To start the game First throwing team Toss a coin to decide which team starts. The first throwing team will always throw all their balls first. The balls will be left on the arena until the opposing team has thrown all their balls. If you choose to play more than one round, then both teams will take turns on being the first throwing team every other round. You need only to toss a coin before playing the first round. Jousts Divide the balls between the team members. The players will then throw their balls from baseline 1 (you may stand anywhere you like behind this line) and try to get one ball in each of the triangles. All ways of throwing are acceptable and a ball is counted as ‚Äúin‚Äù if more than half of it has come to rest inside the triangle's boundary. When both teams have made all their throws, then this is considered completing a joust. Any balls that may have landed inside the triangles after a joust shall remain there. The rest will be removed from the arena and will be thrown in the next joust (if two or more balls belonging to the same team land in one triangle, the team must remove all but one ball from the triangle). If, after throwing your six balls, you have one ball in a triangle, then you have five balls to throw in the next joust. Battle position When you have managed to get one ball in each of the triangles, you have then achieved what is called the battle position. Once in battle position, you may throw your remaining balls from baseline 2 (you may stand anywhere you like behind this line) towards the opposing team's blocks. If you achieve battle position in the middle of a joust and for example have two balls remaining, you may move immediately to baseline 2 and throw them. After that, in every new joust, you have three balls to throw towards the blocks (the three other balls are left in the triangles). How to win To win a round (before starting the game, decide how many rounds to win the Tournament of Knights), you must knock down the opposing team's Lady. But before you're allowed to do that, you must knock down the two knights who are ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù her. Knocking down the Lady before the knights If by mistake you knock down the Lady before the knights, then you have ‚Äúoffended‚Äù the Lady. This will result in a penalty. This means you will lose your battle position and must, even if the opposing team has not yet thrown, immediately remove all your balls from the arena (including the balls in the triangles). Note that it is not permissible to throw any of the balls you may have left over from the current joust. The Lady is replaced upright. If a knight is knocked down, it remains fallen (it does not need to be knocked down again). On your next turn, you must start all over again (from baseline 1) to try to achieve the battle position again. When balls hit each other When you throw the balls, they often hit other balls on the arena. You're allowed to hit the balls in and out of the triangles (even if it means achieving or losing battle position). This is why it's so important not to remove any balls from the arena until the joust is completed, that is to say, when both teams have thrown all their balls. Note that the only exception is when the first throwing team knocks down the Lady before the knights (as described above). When that happens, their balls are removed immediately from the arena. The other team can then complete the joust. After that the first throwing team, as always, starts the next joust. When the opposing team is in battle position When the opposing team is in battle position, you may choose to try to throw your balls so that you knock out their balls from the triangles. You may knock the balls out from all three triangles; however, you only need to knock out one ball to make the opposing team lose its battle position. Then they're not allowed to throw towards the blocks until they (from baseline 1) have succeeded in getting a new ball in the last remaining triangle (the balls in the other two triangles may remain there). If they have already knocked down one or both knights, the knights shall remain fallen (they do not need to be knocked down again). Remember that you may knock out the opposing team's balls from the triangles at any time during the game. The opposing team does not have to be in battle position for this to be allowed. In battle position and choosing from which baseline you wish to throw When you're in battle position you may choose, from one throw to the next, from which baseline you wish to throw. For tactical reasons you may choose to throw from baseline 1 to try to knock out the opposing team's balls from the triangles. For example, when the opposing team's only remaining block left standing is the Lady, and while your team has not succeeded in knocking down any blocks.

Upon awarding the kick, six Manchester United players (Roy Keane, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Jaap Stam, Ryan Giggs and Denis Irwin) chased D'Urso to object to the decision; the resulting image was freely circulated by the media. D'Urso said of the incident: \\"It was my first season in the Premier League, my first time refereeing Manchester United and my first time at Old Trafford. With more experience I would have stood my ground. I kept saying 'go away', but the further back I walked the more they walked on. A more experienced referee would not have retreated. But there are no grudges. I've refereed Roy Keane on a number of occasions since without a problem.\\" Several players, notably, Keane and Stam, have since voiced their regret of the incident. D'Urso booked Keane for dissent shortly after the incident. He refereed the 2001 FA Charity Shield.

He won the All-Japan Selected judo championships for his weight class in April, 1996, to gain a spot on the Japanese olympic team for the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, United States. Though relatively unknown at the world level at the time, he won his first olympic gold medal on July 26, 1996, defeating Girolamo Giovinazzo by seoi nage. Nomura swept the All-Japan Selected judo championships again in 1997, and won a gold medal at the 1997 World Judo Championships in Paris to reinforce his position as the premier competitor at his weight class. After winning the All-Japan Selected judo championships for the third consecutive year in 1998, he injured his left knee in the Jigoro Kano Cup semi-finals on January 9, 1999, and was forced to withdraw from the competition. He did not participate in competitions for the rest of the year to recover from this injury and to complete his degree in health education. Nomura made his return at the All-Japan Selected judo championships in 2000, winning the competition for the third time to gain a second trip to the olympics. He became the first -60 kg division competitor to win consecutive olympic gold medals on September 16, 2000 by defeating Jung Bu-Kyung of South Korea by sumi otoshi only 14 seconds into the match. Nomura married former model Yoko Sakai in May, 2001. During this time Nomura took time off from judo to study abroad in San Francisco. He won the All-Japan Selected judo championships for the first time in three years (fourth total win) in April, 2003 to advance to the 2003 World Judo Championships where he made a disappointing bronze medal finish. He won the Japanese nationals for the second consecutive year (fifth total win) in April, 2004, which enabled him to seek an unprecedented third consecutive olympic gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. On August 14, 2004 he achieved this feat with a win over Nestor Khergiani of Georgia. This made Nomura the only olympic judo practitioner to have won three consecutive gold medals, and the first olympic competitor from Asia to win three consecutive gold medals in any competition. This was also the 100th gold medal won by Japan in the Summer Olympics. Nomura did not participate in judo competitions after the 2004 olympic final, but on January 10, 2006, he announced his intention to seek a fourth consecutive gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He made his return with a win at an international tournament held in the Czech Republic, and won the All-Japan Selected judo championships for the sixth time in 2007. In 2008, however, Nomura failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Games when, on April 5, he was defeated by Daisuke Asano in the semifinals of the -60 kg category at the National Weight Class Invitational Tournament, which represented the last opportunity to clinch the berth as the Japanese athlete in the -60 kg category. A day after his defeat, Nomura made it known, through a spokesperson, his intention to retire from competitive judo. On April 25, he underwent knee surgery, although it remains unknown whether this injury might have played any role in his unexpected elimination from the aforementioned Olympic-qualifying competition. He announced he would continue his career and intended to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sp20090920j1.html Ultimately he did not do so, and announced his retirement from judo in August 2015, stating that his health no longer allowed him to compete.Judo icon Nomura announces retirement, The Japan Times, 31 August 2015.

The work is dated to the reign of Justinian but prior to 535, as it divides the 912 listed cities in the Empire among 64 Eparchies. The Synecdemus is thus one of the most invaluable monuments which we have to study the political geography of the sixth century East. The work of Hierocles along with that of Stephanus of Byzantium were the principal sources of Constantine VII's work on the Themes (De Thematibus). Hierocles was published by Parthey (Hieroclis Synecdemus; Berlin, 1866) then in a corrected text, by A. Burckhardt in the Teubner series (Hieroclis Synecdemus; Leipzig, 1893).

It was developed at the Southwest Research Institute for the NASA Lewis Research Center (now known as NASA Glenn Research Center). The program is based on the Most Probable Point (MPP) concept. This approach uses a response function that depends on the probabilistic distributions of the input variables. Each particular combination of input variable values has a particular probability of occurrence, which is based on the inputs' distributions. Since each input variable combination results in a particular response value, it follows that the probability of obtaining a given response is equal to the probability of obtaining the corresponding input combination. This information is then applied to determine two quantities of interest: * The probability of meeting or exceeding a requirement (for example, a product that is cheap enough to produce so it can be marketed at a competitive price), and * The most likely combinations of input variables which produce satisfactory response values.

Biography His parents were nobles; at a very early age he entered the Dominican convent at Salamanca. Its severe discipline, however, affected his delicate constitution and he was transferred to the convent of St. Paul in Pe√±afiel where he was professed in 1495. On the completion of his studies in Alcal√°, and later at the Colegio de San Gregorio of Valladolid University, he taught philosophy and theology. About the same time he was appointed regent of studies and for two terms filled the office of rector in San Gregorio College. In 1518 he represented his province at the general chapter held at Rome where by unanimous vote he gained the generalship of the Dominican Order in succession to Cardinal Cajetan, a position he held until 1524. After visiting the Dominican houses in Sicily and other countries, he returned to Spain. There he made the acquaintance of Charles V of Spain who chose him for his confessor and later, with papal sanction, offered him the See of Osma, for which he was consecrated on 8 June 1524. Subsequently, he held several offices of political importance, such as President of the American Council of the Indies. In that capacity he was a proponent of the Dominican line of thought and the New Laws of 1542 protecting the Native Americans; they were however revoked in 1545.Harald Kleinschmidt, Charles V: The World Emperor (2004), p. 155. On 16 May 1530 Pope Clement VII created him cardinal and transferred him to the See of Sig√ºenza, where he became Bishop of Sig√ºenza on 23 February 1532. He was made Archbishop of Seville on 23 May 1539, and became Grand Inquisitor in 1546, the year of his death. Legacy His writings are limited to a few pastoral letters. G. Haine found, in the royal library at Simancas, Garcia's letters to Charles V written in the years 1530‚Äì32, of interest for the history of the Protestant Reformation as well as for the religious and political history of Spain during that period.

He was duly named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1909. Marshal was unable to repeat the success of 1908, however. He scored 1,000 runs again for Surrey in 1909, but at a much reduced average. He was suspended for some games by the club committee following an incident when Surrey were playing Derbyshire at Chesterfield. The committee did not publicly give the reason for their decision but, according to Jack Hobbs' autobiography published in 1935, Marshal and some teammates had been heading and kicking a ball about in the street on their way to their hotel. A police constable asked Marshal for his name. However he refused to give it, so was taken to the police station. The case was sent to the Chief Constable, but he dismissed it and it did not reach court. Hobbs himself was not in Chesterfield, as he was playing for England at the time.Lemmon, David (1989) The History of Surrey County Cricket Club. Christopher Helm. . p. 127. After a handful of games at the start of the 1910 season, Marshal's contract was ended. He returned to Australia, where he again appeared in occasional matches for Queensland, but with limited success. His first-class figures were: 119 matches, 198 innings, 13 n.o., 5,177 runs, highest score 176, with an average of 27.98; 114 catches. Bowling: 119 wickets for 2,718 runs, at an average of 22.84. His best bowling was 7 for 41. In World War I, he was one of the Australian troops sent to Gallipoli, where he caught enteric fever. He was evacuated to Malta, but died there. Alan Marshal was a great-uncle of actor Alan Marshal (1909‚Äì1961).

The band originally formed in 1998, when western Massachusetts native Joe McMahon (lead vocals and bass) got together with Chris Brand (guitar), Bill Ironfield (guitar), and Nick Maggiore (drums), hailing from New Hampshire. Originally calling themselves Jericho, the band released their debut album, When the Battery Dies, in 2000. After the release of this record Chris Brand left and Jeremy Cochran replaced him. Their fan base grew as they played DIY basement shows and small clubs throughout the Northeast. When living in Boston proved too expensive, the quartet moved to Richmond, Virginia to explore the punk rock scene and to work on their second album. This is when Bill Ironfield left the band, and Ken Gurley joined on bass, with Joe McMahon taking over guitar. It was at about this time that band was contacted by a 1970s-era Christian rock band from Houston, Texas also called Jericho, to inform them that the name was already taken. To avoid confusion and legal action, the band politely amended it to Jericho RVA. The initials were a nod to their adopted hometown of Richmond, Virginia. Jericho RVA is the name that appears on their 2003 EP Worker's Union. An older version, released under the original name (Jericho), does not include the song \\"Oxygen\\" that is on the Jericho RVA release. The other 6 songs of the EP are the same on both records. Worker's Union caught the attention of reviewers and established bands interested in taking them out on tour. Due to pressure from Christian groups that complained about the religious \\"blasphemy\\" of a bible-derived name, Jericho RVA changed their name again to Smoke or Fire. Due to the strength of the Worker's Union EP, Smoke or Fire were approached by esteemed California punk rock label Fat Wreck Chords in late 2004. Their debut album, Above the City, was co-produced by Fat Mike of NOFX and was released in March 2005. Since then the band has toured the US and abroad many times over. The band released their second album This Sinking Ship on February 20, 2007. Their third and, to date, final album The Speakeasy was finally released November 9, 2010. Some of the tracks were released ahead of time as teasers such as \\"Neon Lights\\" and the track \\"The Speakeasy\\". Since relocating to Germany, Joe McMahon has been touring solo almost non-stop, and his debut solo album is due for release in 2016.

It was founded in 1085 by the Danish king Canute the Saint. It is the oldest school in Scandinavia and one of the oldest schools in Northern Europe. Despite being a public school, admittance to the Lund Cathedral School requires an application, and it is considered one of the toughest schools to get accepted to in Lund. History The Cathedral School in 1912. The school was founded by a donation from the Danish king Canute the Saint. In the beginning, it was most likely a cathedral school, a seminary for the training of priests and other clergy within the church. Its clerical roots are also the origin of the school's name. During the Scanian Wars and the transition to Swedish rule, the school was for a while reduced to an insignificant elementary school with just two classes. For the first 750 years of its existence, the school was located directly adjacent to the Cathedral in Lund. However, in 1837, the school acquired Viffertska g√•rden, which has been considered one of the most prestigious buildings in Lund since the 16th century. For two years at the beginning of the 18th century, the Swedish king Charles XII had his residence there. Despite many wars and several transitions between Danish and Swedish rule, the school has maintained some form of teaching continuously since it was founded in 1085. Today Students in the school's inner court Today, the Cathedral School is an Upper Secondary School, or gymnasium, with about 1400 students attending seven different programmes; the Science Programme (Naturvetenskapsprogrammet), the Social Science Programme (Samh√§llsvetenskapsprogrammet), the Lingua Programme (Linguaprogrammet), the History Programme (Historieprogrammet), the Humanist Programme (Humanistiska programmet), the Economy Programme (Ekonomiprogrammet) and the IB Diploma Programme. The History Programme started in 2009 as a part of a government decision to instate special programmes in theoretical subjects in selected schools in the country. It is the only History programme in Sweden. The Cathedral School currently resides in six buildings; The main building, The Charles XII house, The Brunius house, The Svanegatshouse, Cathedral School West and the Svane School. Several currently well-known people have attended it, among whom are actor Max von Sydow and several high-ranking politicians. Among the famous students are swedish sport stars Max Salminen and Henrik Stenson. Student Societies There are a number of Student Societies in the school, the two most venerable ones being the theatre association Scenia (a word game alluding to 'wikt:scene' and the Latin name of the province of Lund, Scania) and the photographic society Asarna (a similar word game alluding to Norse mythology and to the ASA standard for analogue photography). Scenia was started in 1945 by a group of students, including the later famous actor Max von Sydow. The drama group arranged and performed a variety of different Swedish plays and it became a tradition that passed on to younger students after graduation. Scenia was active throughout the 1950s but was then laid on ice until it was reborn as Katterevyn in the 1980s, that today is considered a Spex and is arranged every spring. About 150 students are involved in the process each year. In May 2008, \\"God Afton Vackra Mask\\" (\\"Good Evening, Beautiful Mask\\"), alluding to the murder of king Gustav III, was performed at AF-borgen in Lundag√•rd. In 2016, a team from the school became the first from Scandinavia to win a title (in the Varsity Bowl Division) in the International History Bee and Bowl European Championships, which were held in Berlin that year.

It first produced cask ales in 1978. Products The brewery produces cask ale and filtered beer in bottles. History The business was founded in 1865 by William Moorhouse as a producer of mineral waters. The business was successful and by 1870 Moorhouse had a purpose built building erected in Moorhouse Street off Accrington Road, Burnley which incorporated stables for the delivery horses and houses for the workers and Moorhouse family. William's sons took over the business and early in the 20th century began making low alcohol hop bitters which were exported throughout the world, notably United States and the Middle East. In the 1930s the mineral water production was sold to Thwaites Brewery. In 1978 Michael Ryan, a local builder, bought the premises and equipment from Tom Fawcett, the cousin of the last surviving Moorhouse family member, Ben Moorhouse (Ben has a son -Robert - who, in turn, has a son - William Moorhouse - born in 2011). Ryan turned the soft drinks company into a cask ale brewery. The first cask ale produced was Premier Bitter. The brewery struggled during its first four years, changing owners several times before being taken over in 1982 by Alan Hutchinson, a local hotel owner, who introduced the successful Pendle Witches Brew brand. After Hutchinson died in 1985 the brewing side of the business was about to be closed down when William Parkinson, a businessman who was born in Burnley, tried the last batch of Pendle Witches Brew and decided to buy the brewery, investing ¬£500,000 in new equipment, a distribution depot, and buying six pubs.

There were nine games in the series: 2K5, 2K6, 2K7, 2K8, 2K9, 2K10, 2K11, 2K12 and 2K13. All games were created for each MLB season. The series was created in 2005 after Visual Concepts teamed up with 2K Sports. Visual Concepts called the series World Series and ESPN Major League Baseball in years prior to 2005. In 2014, 2K Games announced that the series had been discontinued, following the release of 2K13. 2005 The first edition of the series, powered by ESPN. The game included Web Gems instant replays, K-Zone pitching, Slam Zone hitting, and baserunner mode. The game was released in late February 2005 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. The cover baseball player was Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter. Later that year, World Series 2K5 was released during the 2005 MLB postseason. In 2005, in response to EA Sports' exclusive license with the National Football League and ESPN prohibiting any NFL 2K games for the foreseeable future, Take-Two Interactive signed an exclusive third-party licensing contract with Major League Baseball (MLB), MLBPA and MLBAM to produce MLB games. The agreement, which runs from Spring 2006 to 2012, allows for the console manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo to produce MLB titles for their respective platforms, but bars third party developers such as EA Sports from continuing or developing their own MLB games. 2006 The 2006 edition, Major League Baseball 2K6, had the ESPN presentation and trademarks removed but the commentary team of Jon Miller and Joe Morgan remained intact. The game included Inside Edge scouting, Swing Stick hitting, and Payoff Pitching. The game was released on April 3, 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox; April 10 for the Xbox 360, and April 13 for the PSP. The game was also released for the GameCube, making it the first and only MLB 2K title to ever appear on the system. The cover baseball player was once again Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter. 2007 The 2007 edition, Major League Baseball 2K7, featured a major overhaul on the \\"next gen\\" systems, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, featuring a near-photorealistic pitcher/batter interface. For the third year in a row, Derek Jeter was the cover player. The GameCube was dropped as a platform, and the Wii version was not developed. The major leap in gameplay and graphics were largely attributed to the addition of Ben Brinkman to Kush Games; Brinkman had been the lead developer for the MVP Baseball series of games. 2008 The 2008 edition, Major League Baseball 2K8 was available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and, for the first time, the Wii. Jos√© Reyes was the new cover athlete, taking over for Jeter. A special version of the game was developed for the Nintendo DS called Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All-Stars, which featured fantasy elements such as power ups and fantasy stadiums. 2009 The 2009 edition, Major League Baseball 2K9, represented the final act of a planned three year development cycle that started with 2K7. Tim Lincecum replaced Reyes as the cover athlete, and was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and, for the first time, Windows PC. The game changed announcers as well; MLB 2K9 replaced Jon Miller and Joe Morgan with Gary Thorne for play by play and Steve Phillips for color commentary. MLB Front Office Manager represents the first foray into sports management games for 2K Sports, as well as the second PC game, after NBA 2K9. Major League Baseball 2K9 Fantasy All-Stars was the second in the series for the Nintendo DS. 2010 Major League Baseball 2K10, like its counterpart NBA 2K10, is being feted over its 10th anniversary, and was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and Wii. Evan Longoria replaced Tim Lincecum as the new cover athlete. 2011 Major League Baseball 2K11 was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation 2. Roy Halladay replaced Evan Longoria as the cover athlete. 2012 Major League Baseball 2K12 was announced after the release of NBA 2K12. The game was released on March 6, 2012. It was released on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Windows PC, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation 2. Justin Verlander replaced Roy Halladay as cover athlete. The game was slightly criticized for a copy and paste with a roster update but MLB 2K12 did improve on graphics. For PS2 users it took a step backwards and looked similar to 2K6. 2K12 was the last planned game under the exclusive licensing agreement and in a last-minute decision they renewed their license with MLB to make a 2013 Game. 2013 Featured on the 2K13 cover is David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. The game is almost the same as 2K12 but with some online features missing and updated rosters. However, the game was not received well due to the lack of new features and the removal of league play.

Also known as Geschwind‚Äôs territory after Norman Geschwind, an American neurologist, who in the early 1960s recognised its importance. It is a part of the parietal lobe. Structure It is divided from rostral to caudal into two gyri: * One, the supramarginal gyrus, arches over the upturned end of the lateral fissure; it is continuous in front with the postcentral gyrus, and behind with the superior temporal gyrus. * The second, the angular gyrus, arches over the posterior end of the superior temporal sulcus, behind which it is continuous with the middle temporal gyrus. In macaque neuroanatomy, this region is often divided into caudal and rostral portions, cIPL and rIPL, respectively. The cIPL is further divided into areas Opt and PG whereas rIPL is divided into PFG and PF areas. Function Inferior parietal lobule has been involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli, and interpretation of sensory information. The Inferior parietal lobule is concerned with language, mathematical operations, and body image, particularly the supramarginal gyrus and the angular gyrus. Clinical significance Destruction to the inferior parietal lobule of the dominant hemisphere results in Gerstmann's syndrome: right-to-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysgraphia and dyslexia, dyscalculia, contralateral hemianopia, or lower quadrantanopia. Destruction to the inferior parietal lobule of the non- dominant hemisphere results in topographic memory loss, anosognosia, construction apraxia, dressing apraxia, contralateral sensory neglect, contralateral hemianopia, or lower quadrantanopia.  In other animals Functional imaging experiments suggest that the left anterior supramarginal gyrus (aSMG) of the human inferior parietal lobule exhibits an evolved specialization related to tool use. It is not currently known if this functional specialization is unique to humans as complementary experiments have only been performed with macaque monkeys and not apes. The habitual use of tools by chimpanzees makes the uniqueness of the human aSMG an open question as its function may have evolved prior to the split from our last common ancestor.

Historically this weapon is very prevalent and can be found attached to a weapon or used separately. It is a weapon designed for warfare. In more recent times, specifically the end of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, the surujin appeared as a weighted lightweight chain varying in length between 2 and 3 metres in length. At one end was a weight and the other a metal spike. The weight was used to throw at an opponent or to ensnare a weapon and the length of chain was then either pulled to unbalance the enemy or used to entwine them using techniques similar to that of hojojutsu.

In the episode, protagonist Jerry Seinfeld buys an expensive suede jacket and has dinner with the father of his ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. Elaine's father Alton (Lawrence Tierney), a war veteran and writer, makes Jerry and his friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander) very uncomfortable. Elaine is delayed and Jerry and George are stuck with Alton waiting for her at the hotel. The episode was written by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and was directed by Tom Cherones. Most of the episode's storyline was based on one of David's personal experiences. Elaine's father, a published author, was inspired by Richard Yates, author of Revolutionary Road, whom Larry David had met while dating his daughter. Tierney's performance as Alton Benes was praised by the cast and crew. However, they were taken aback by his eccentric behavior. The majority of the episode was filmed on December 4, 1990. \\"The Jacket\\" premiered on American television on February 6, 1991, on NBC, it gained a Nielsen rating of 10.4/16 and was praised by critics. Plot When Jerry is shopping for clothes with Elaine, he finds a suede jacket that he likes. He has doubts about buying the jacket because it is very expensive and has a candy-stripe lining. He eventually decides to buy it. Kramer persuades Jerry to give him his old leather jacket as he will no longer be using it. The following night, Jerry, Elaine and George have dinner with Elaine's father, writer Alton Benes. While preparing for the dinner, George arrives at Jerry's apartment with the song \\"Master of the House\\" stuck in his head. Both George and Jerry are nervous to meet Alton because they are in awe of his writings. Kramer enters the apartment and asks them to guard his illegally parked car for two minutes as he carries down some doves that he is looking after for a magician friend. However, they refuse to help because he often underestimates how long things take to do. As they enter Alton Benes' hotel, Elaine has not arrived yet, forcing them to wait with her father for 30 minutes. Jerry and George are made increasingly uncomfortable by Alton's socially awkward and intimidating manner. When Elaine finally arrives, she explains that Kramer promised her a lift if she would wait in his car for two minutes. He returned over 20 minutes later, and the car had been towed for being illegally parked. On their way out, they notice it is snowing. Jerry knows snow would ruin his suede jacket and asks Alton if they can take a cab, but Alton replies that the restaurant is only a few blocks away. George suggests Jerry turn the jacket inside out, but because of the candy-stripe lining, Alton insists he turn it back. He also silences George when he starts singing \\"Master of the House.\\" The next day, Kramer notices Jerry's jacket (now badly damaged from the snow) hanging in the bathroom and asks if he can have it. Elaine arrives and tells Jerry that her father had a good time, even though he usually hates everyone. As Alton drives home, he finds himself singing \\"Master of the House.\\" Cultural references * Throughout the episode, George sings the song \\"Master of the House\\" from the musical Les Mis√©rables. Les Mis√©rables ran on Broadway for sixteen years, making it one of the longest-running musicals in Broadway's history. In response to George constantly singing \\"Master of the House,\\" Jerry tells him about German composer Robert Schumann, who went insane from hearing the same note over and over in his head. * George mentions Bud Abbott, an actor and comedian during the 1940s and 1950s, who was part of the Abbott and Costello duo. * When Jerry and George discuss their options in the hotel bathroom, George suggests that they leave, to which Jerry replies \\"He'll clunk our heads together like Moe.\\" This a reference to Moe Howard, one of The Three Stooges, who frequently clunked the heads of the other Stooges together. Production Jerry Seinfeld co-wrote the episode \\"The Jacket\\" was written by Seinfeld co- creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Tom Cherones. The episode's storyline was based on one of David's personal experiences; when he was dating Monica Yates, she wanted him to meet her father, Richard Yates, a respected novelist. David had just bought a suede jacket, and met Richard Yates at the Algonquin Hotel. David stated in an interview that Richard Yates was \\"... every bit as intimidating as Alton Benes\\". His story is similar to what happened in the episode, as, when they headed out to the restaurant, his jacket was ruined by the snow. Additional dialogue at the store where Jerry buys his jacket was cut before broadcast; it featured a reference to Gary Gilmore. The material was later included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. \\"The Jacket\\" is the only episode in which one of Elaine's parents appears; Louis-Dreyfus once suggested Mary Tyler Moore to portray Elaine's mother, but the character never appeared on the show. The episode also contains the first mention to Elaine's job as a manuscript reader for Pendant Publishing; in early drafts of the script, her job was an optician. Also in early drafts, in the final scene Kramer entered Jerry's house with a dove on his shoulder. The episode was first read by the cast on November 28, 1990 at 10:30 AM. It was filmed in front of a live audience on December 4, 1990. The episode was filmed at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season two premiere \\"The Ex-Girlfriend\\", all filming for the second season took place. The final scene in the episode, which showed Alton Benes singing \\"Master of the House\\" in his car, was pre-recorded on December 3, 1990, as it could not be filmed in front of an audience because it took place in a car. Lawrence Tierney was cast as Alton Benes. He was known for his bad- guy roles in films during the 1940s and 1950s, such as Dillinger, The Hoodlum and Born to Kill. Tierney's appearance in the episode is one of his only comedic roles. Cast and crew members were very impressed with his performance and intended to make Alton Benes a recurring character. However, they were frightened of him; during filming it was discovered that Tierney had stolen a butcher knife from the knife block in Jerry's apartment set. Various cast members remember Seinfeld encountering Tierney and stating \\"Hey Lawrence, what do you got there in your jacket?\\" Tierney, realizing he had been caught, tried to make a joke about how he thought taking the knife would be funny, by reenacting a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), holding the knife above his head and making threatening motions towards Seinfeld. Tom Cherones, Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus saw this happen, and, as Alexander recalled, it \\"scared the living crap out of all of us.\\" Cherones stated that, afterwards, Larry David would jokingly threaten to have Tierney back on the show if Cherones did his work badly. Reception On February 6, 1991, \\"The Jacket\\" was first broadcast in the United States on NBC. It gained a Nielsen rating of 10.4 and an audience share of 16, this means that 10.4% of American households watched the episode, and that 16% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. It faced strong competition from the CBS crime drama Jake and the Fatman; viewers would frequently tune out of Seinfeld to watch the second half of Jake and the Fatmans. Seinfeld once jokingly stated that this was because the \\"Fatman\\" would run in the second half of the show. The episode gained positive responses from critics. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide stated \\"An otherwise mediocre episode, Lawrence Tierney‚Äôs gruff turn as Elaine‚Äôs father helps redeem 'The Jacket.'\\" DVD reviewer Jonathan Boudreaux considered \\"The Jacket\\" one of season two's best episodes, along with \\"The Chinese Restaurant.\\" Critics Mary Kaye Schilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode with a B-, stating, \\"Jerry and George's torturous hotel-lobby meeting with Mr. Benes is a squirm-inducing joy.\\" References External links \\"The Jacket\\" at Sony Pictures * \\"The Jacket\\" at Allmovie 1991 American television episodes Seinfeld (season 2) episodes Seinfeld ","title":"The Jacket (Seinfeld)"},{"id":"4335749","text":"Kingfisher is an Indian beer brewed by United Breweries Group, Bangalore.

While not a power hitter, he hit for average and was a good contact hitter for most of his career. He topped the .300 mark six times, with his best season coming in with the Indians, when he hit .369 to win the American League batting title, after coming off a season in which he broke his leg. His success was short-lived, however, as he broke his arm in , and a torn ligament in his leg prematurely ended his playing career.

His on-base percentage was .355 and slugging percentage was .432. His career fielding percentage was .983. Fonseca was one of the first to use film in analyzing baseball games and finding flaws in players. It is said that his interest with cameras began while shooting Slide, Kelly, Slide in 1927. As manager of the Chicago White Sox, he used film extensively. After retiring from playing the game, he was director of promotions for both leagues.

In 1841, a group of members formed the First African Baptist Church. It is a stuccoed temple- form Greek Revival style building with the two fluted Doric order columns of its portico in antis. During the American Civil War the church building served as an emergency hospital for Confederate Army soldiers. In 1938, the congregation sold the church to the Medical College of Virginia. and Accompanying photo Style and Worship First Baptist Church offers two traditional Sunday services, the one at 11:00 am being broadcast live on WRIC- TV. Most aspects of the church reflect traditional Baptist churches, including Sunday school prior to worship and evening bible studies throughout the week. The music during worship is several hymns, an offertory song (usually instrumental) and a choral anthem. Other music that may be added is children or youth choir, English handbells or various soloists on instruments. Wednesdays offer a meal and activities for everyone. The Youth Group takes up the whole third floor and is 8th to 12th graders. There are usually a minimum fifty people during Sunday services.

Jaenisch has focused on creating genetically modified mice to study cancer and neurological diseases.  Research  Jaenisch‚Äôs first breakthrough occurred in 1974 when he and Beatrice Mintz showed that foreign DNA could be integrated into the DNA of early mouse embryos. They injected retrovirus DNA into early mouse embryos and showed that leukemia DNA sequences had integrated into the mouse genome and also to its offspring. These mice were the first transgenic mammals in history. His current research focuses on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, which has led to major advances in creating embryonic stem cells and ‚Äúinduced pluripotent stem\\" (IPS) cells, as well as their therapeutic applications. In 2007, Jaenisch‚Äôs laboratory was one of the first three laboratories world-wide to report reprogramming cells taken from a mouse's tail into IPS cells. Jaenisch has since shown therapeutic benefits of IPS cell-based treatment for sickle-cell anemia and Parkinson's disease in mice. Additional research focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms involved in cancer and brain development. Jaenisch‚Äôs therapeutic cloning research deals exclusively with mice, but he is an advocate for using the same techniques with human cells in order to advance embryonic stem cell research. However, in 2001 Jaenisch made a public case against human reproductive cloning, testifying to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee and an editorial in Science magazine.  Career  Jaenisch received his doctorate in medicine from the University of Munich in 1967, preferring the laboratory to the clinic.

He served as an MLA from 1993 to 2014, as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 2010 to 2014, and as a member of the provincial cabinet from 1999 to 2006. Early life & career Born in Woodstock, New Brunswick, the son of Robert Graham and Letha Delong, Graham attended school in Centreville. He became a small business owner and was involved in local politics at the school board level. He married Shelley McDougall in 1972. In the 1991 provincial election, Graham was defeated by Liberal incumbent Fred Harvey, however Harvey's victory was later declared void when Harvey was convicted of violating election spending laws. Graham was successful in a by-election in 1993 winning the Carleton North seat. Graham went on to be re-elected in the new electoral district of Carleton in the 1995, 1999, 2003, 2006 and 2010 elections. Graham's 1993 victory was a key test for his Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick. His party had been defeated provincially in 1987 going from having led the government for 17 years to being shut out of the legislature. Though the party regained 3 seats in the 58 seat legislature in 1991, the upstart Confederation of Regions Party of New Brunswick (CoR) had won 8 seats and claimed official opposition. Graham's victory was seen as a sign that CoR would not necessarily displace the Progressive Conservatives as the voice of conservatism in Anglophone New Brunswick. In 1999, Graham's party was returned to government. Graham, who co-chaired the election campaign, was named deputy premier and Minister of Supply and Services. On July 21, 2005, Graham added the responsibilities of Minister of Environment & Local Government on an acting basis when his cabinet colleague Brenda Fowlie was forced to resign from the cabinet. He retained the portfolio until November 21, 2005. In a cabinet shuffle on February 14, 2006, Graham was shuffled to the post of minister responsible for the Office of Human Resources and for Service New Brunswick. He retained his honorary post of deputy premier. His party failed to win a plurality of seats in the 2006 election so Graham left cabinet and returned to opposition. He was re-elected in 2010 and his party returned to government, and he became dean of the legislature; he was excluded from cabinet but was elected to serve as speaker of the legislature. He did not seek re-election in 2014.

Erratum: Systematics and Biodiversity 3(3):343. reported the discovery of a wholly unique new species of rodent, Laonastes aenigmamus, for which they created a new family, Laonastidae. They suggested it was a hystricognath rodent, but basal to all other hystricognaths. Dawson, et al,Dawson, M. R., L. Marivaux, C.-k. Li, K. C. Beard, and G. M√©tais. 2006. Laonastes and the \\"Lazarus effect\\" in Recent mammals. Science, 311:1456-1458. re-evaluated the phylogenetic position of Laonastes based on morphology and included fossil taxa in their analysis. They determined Laonastes is actually sciurognathous and belongs to the Diatomyidae. They also described the Diatomyidae as a Lazarus taxon due to the 11-million-year gap between the most recent diatomyid in the fossil record and the existence of Laonastes today. The only other comparable length of time for a mammal Lazarus taxon is the monito del monte, which is part of a family (Microbiotheriidae), also most recently known from Miocene deposits. Mary Dawson described Laonastes as the \\"coelacanth of rodents\\".http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11746910  Characteristics  The Diatomyidae are similar to both the Ctenodactylidae and the Anomaluromorpha in being simultaneously hystricomorphous and sciurognathous. The masseteric fossa in diatomyids is enlarged and extends to below the first cheek tooth. The enamel on incisors is multiserial (similar to the springhare, gundis, and Hystricognathi). The single premolar on both the upper and lower tooth rows is enlarged (unlike the reduced state in Ctenodactylidae). Most diatomyids have cheek teeth with four roots except for the first. In Laonastes, the lower molars have four roots, but upper cheek teeth have three roots including a U-shaped anterior root that may be derived from the merging of two roots. Living diatomyids are only represented by the Laotian rock rat from the Khammouan region of Laos. Fossil diatomyids have been recovered in Pakistan, India, Thailand, China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.  Relationship to other rodents  The uniqueness of the Laotian rock rat was clear upon its initial discovery. The results of the phylogenetic analyses were somewhat inconclusive and contradictory. Both morphological and molecular studies suggested Laonastes is a member of the rodent suborder Hystricognathi. The morphological analysis suggested it is the most basal hystricognath. Fossil taxa were not included in the morphological analysis. Analysis of mtDNA 12S rRNA and cytochrome b sequence, however, suggested Laonastes might be related to living African hystricognaths such as the dassie rat and the naked mole rat. Another type of analysis on the cytochrome b sequence data produced the same result as morphology. Neither analysis, however, showed entirely robust statistical support for the position of Laonastes within the hystricognaths; altogether, it appeared to belong among the basal African radiation. Dawson et al. also refuted the notion that Laonastes is a hystricognath and instead argued that the mandible is sciurognathous. They evaluated Laonastes in comparison to several fossil rodents and determined it is closely related to the diatomyids, particularly Diatomys. Their results suggested the Diatomyidae are a sister group to the Ctenodactylidae, and this diatomyid/ctenodactylid clade (along with the Yuomyidae) is sister to the Hystricognathi. Besides Laonastes, other diatomyids have also been placed in different families. Some Mein, P. and L. Ginsburg, L. 1985. Les rongeurs mioc√®nes de Li (Thailande).

An Unusual Diatomyid Rodent from an Infrequently Sampled Late Miocene Interval in the Siwaliks of Pakistan, Palaeontologia Electronica Vol. 8, Issue 1; 17A:10p, considered Fallomus to belong to the Chapattimyidae (a completely fossil group). The family Diatomyidae was erected and considered to be a member of the superfamily Ctenodactyloidea. Marivaux et al.Marivaux, L., M. Vianey- Liaud, and J.-J. Jaeger. 2004. High-level phylogeny of early Tertiary rodents: dental evidence. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 142:105-134. united the two into a single family (Diatomyidae), but also suggested this family might be related to the Pedetidae. Dawson's fossil study was corroborated by more comprehensive DNA sequence analyses,Huchon, Doroth√©e; Chevret, Pascale; Jordan, Ursula; Kilpatrick, C. William; Ranwez, Vincent; Jenkins, Paulina D.; Brosius, J√ºrgen & Schmitz, J√ºrgen (2007): Multiple molecular evidences for a living mammalian fossil. PNAS 104(18): 7495-7499. (HTML abstract) which suggested a roughly Lutetian (about 44 Mya, Early/Middle Eocene) divergence date between the ancestors of the Laotian rock rat and the African gundis, which are each other's closest living relatives. Considering the present-day distribution, the fossil record, and Eocene paleogeography, this divergence probably took place in one of three regions. Either the lineages split in Eurasia, somewhere in today's Zagros Mountains or adjacent ranges of the Alpide belt. These at that time formed a rugged and broken coastline with many offshore islands, as they emerged from the shrinking Tethys Sea.Marivaux, L. J. L. Welcomme, M. Vianey-Liaud, and J.J. Jaeger. 2002. The role of Asia in the origin and diversification of hystricognathous rodents. Zoologica Scripta, 31:225-239. Alternatively, the entire Ctenodactyloidea might be of African origin, or the lineage split took place on India as it joined the Asian mainland, with the gundis reaching Africa via the Mascarene Plateau's archipelagos and island continents.Nanda, A.C. & Sahni, A. (1998). Ctenodactyloid rodent assemblage from Kargil Formation, Ladakh molasses group: Age and paleobiogeographic implications for the Indian subcontinent in the Oligo-Miocene. Geobios 31:533-544. Each hypothesis would unite the paleontological, anatomical, and molecular findings into a robust model. Which one is preferred depends on whether the Hystricomorpha were Laurasian or Gondwanan in origin.

Over 45% of Kentucky's population live in counties that border the Ohio River, although those counties are only 16% of the state's land area. The Ohio Valley in Kentucky can be broken up into several categories: The Ohio Valley in Eastern and Northern Kentucky The physical characteristics of the Ohio River valley changes very little from its beginning in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to just northeast of Louisville, including the section that flows through a small part of the Cumberland Plateau and the Eden Shale hill region of Northern Kentucky. Throughout that entire stretch the river is contained in a very narrow valley bounded by hills that are from 100 to tall and have an average angle of 45 degrees. The river ranges in width in this stretch from around 1/4 of a mile to over 4/10 of a mile. The Ohio Valley in the Louisville Area The Ohio Valley changes dramatically around Louisville, as for the first time heading downstream there are no bluffs overlooking the river. The river itself gets much wider and shallower, from 4/10 of a mile wide to over 9/10 a mile wide at the canal entrance, then narrows to less than 3/10 of a mile downstream of the falls as it approaches the Falls of the Ohio, the only natural obstacle along the entire river. The falls were created by very hard coral rock, which the river hasn't been able to erode. The coral contains many visible fossils. The flood plain through this stretch is very wide and flat, extending out on the Kentucky side and four miles (6 km) on the Indiana side, both east of the Muldraugh Escarpment. Also known as Muldraugh Hill, it divides the Bluegrass and Pennyroyal Plateau Regions in Kentucky, and the \\"karst plateau\\" in Indiana. The tall hill is very visible in most parts of Louisville and provides a scenic backdrop for the city. From Muldraugh Hill to Owensboro At West Point, Kentucky the river crosses the Muldraugh escarpment and is now bounded on both sides by the largest bluffs along its entire length. The bluffs here range from 400‚Äì500 feet and in many places are almost vertical, although the flood plain is about twice as wide as in Northern Kentucky. The river here averages around 4/10 of a mile wide. From Owensboro to the Mississippi River Starting near Rockport, Indiana the bluffs above the river reduce greatly to or less as the river enters a much flatter region. The river itself becomes much more like the Mississippi River in character, widening from around 1/2 a mile wide in the West Point stretch to over 8/10 of a mile, and with many more islands and oxbow lakes. This stretch of the river has 35 islands. many of the oxbow lakes in this stretch have been made into wildlife management areas mostly for waterfowl, including the Ballard WMA which is the state's largest.

He formed the original band and began its chaotic songwriting method of jamming. At an early performance at the Hacienda he played his guitar left handed. He advocated improvisation during live performances and during group recording sessions. Gilbertson was replaced in the band by Larry Gott. Gilbertson is currently working as a taxi driver in South Manchester and no contact has been made with the band for several years since. Improvisation Gilbertson was childhood friends with Jim Glennie, who had no real interest in music at the time. Gilbertson convinced Glennie to buy a bass guitar and help him form a band. Two weeks later, having never played any instruments before, Gilbertson announced they were to play their first gig. This fearless attitude had a strong influence on James. Gilbertson insisted on doing improvisations onstage as well as off and was at first adamant that he and Glennie should not take guitar or bass lessons, and that the band should not record separately in booths on different days, but rather worked as a group for recordings. He believed this kept the music special and exciting, because no one was consciously controlling the direction of the music. The music was forming organically, as opposed to being written in advance. Gilbertson and Glennie remained close friends throughout the band's early years. Gavan Whelan and Tim Booth later joined the band. This first line up went on to perform regularly, including playing at the Hacienda Club in Manchester. Departure from James Gilbertson left the band after a period of him losing interest in attending practices and performances, and error- prone playing. Gilbertson turned up late for a performance and was told he was no longer in James and had been replaced by Larry Gott. Glennie and Gilbertson knew Gott previously as their guitar tutor, and later as someone who was involved with the band arranging gigs and recording demos.

These defects, in the form of both lattice vacancies and atoms at interstitial sites, have the effect of temporarily trapping the electrons and holes which are created when ionizing particles pass through the detector. Since it is these electrons and holes drifting in an electric field which produce a signal that announces the passage of a particle, when large amounts of defects are produced, the detector signal can be strongly reduced leading to an unusable (dead) detector. Radiation damage produced by relativistic lead ions from the SPS beam hitting a silicon microstrip detector of the NA50 experiment at CERN However in 1997, Vittorio Giulio Palmieri, Kurt Borer, Stefan Janos, Cinzia Da Vi√° and Luca Casagrande at the University of Bern (Switzerland) found out that at temperatures below 130 kelvins (about ‚àí143 degrees Celsius), dead detectors apparently come back to life. The explanation of this phenomenon, known as the Lazarus effect, is related to the dynamics of the induced defects in the semiconductor bulk. At room temperature radiation damage induced defects temporarily trap electrons and holes resulting from ionization, which are then emitted back to the conduction band or valence band in a time that is typically longer than the read-out time of the connected electronics. Consequently the measured signal is smaller than it should be. This leads to low signal to noise ratios that in turn can prevent the detection of the traversing particle. At cryogenic temperatures, however, once an electron or hole, resulting from ionization or from detector leakage current, is trapped in a local defect, it remains trapped for a long time due to the very low thermal energy of the lattice. This leads to a large fraction of 'traps' becoming filled and therefore inactive. Trapping of electrons and holes generated by particles traversing the detector is then prevented and little or no signal is lost. The understanding of this has been detailed in a number of papers.K.

It is called \\"very joyous\\" because the bodhisattva works at the perfections of generosity and develops the ability to give away everything without regret and with no thought of praise or reward (for themselves). All phenomena are viewed as empty and as subject to decay, suffering, and death, and so bodhisattvas lose all attachment to them. According to Tsong Khapa, first level bodhisattvas directly understand that persons do not exist by way of their own nature. Due to this, they overcome the false idea that the five aggregates constitute a truly existent person. They also eliminate predispositions toward corrupted ethics so completely that they will not arise again. Despite having directly and correctly perceived emptiness, bodhisattvas on the first level are primarily motivated by faith. They train in ethics in order to cleanse their minds of negativity and so they prepare themselves for the cultivation of mundane meditative absorption that comes on the second level. = The second bh≈´mi, the Stainless = Bodhisattvas on the second level, the \\"Stainless\\", perfect ethics and overcome all tendencies towards engagement in negative actions. Their control becomes so complete that even in dreams they have no immoral thoughts. According to Tsong Khapa for such a bodhisattva, > \\"on all occasions of waking and dreaming his movements or activities of > body, speech and mind are pure of even subtle infractions...he fulfills the > three paths of virtuous actions-abandoning killing, stealing, and sexual > misconduct-with his body; the middle four-abandons lying, divisive talk, > harsh speech, and senseless chatter-with his speech; and the last three- > abandoning covetousness, harmful intent, and wrong views-with his mind. Not > only does he refrain from what is prohibited but he also fulfills all the > positive achievements related to proper ethics.\\" And according to NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, > The second is called the Stainless Because all ten [virtuous] actions Of > body, speech, and mind are stainless And they naturally abide in those > [deeds of ethics]. Through the maturation of those [good qualities] The > perfection of ethics becomes supreme. They become Universal Monarchs helping > beings, Masters of the glorious four continents and of the seven precious > objects. Because of this, the bodhisattva's mind becomes purified and equinanimous, which is a prerequisite for training in the four dhyƒÅnas (meditative absorptions) and the four ar≈´pajhƒÅnas (formless absorptions). = The third bh≈´mi, the Light-Maker = Tsong Khapa states that the third bh≈´mi is called the \\"Light-Maker\\" because when it is attained \\"the fire of wisdom burning all the fuel of objects of knowledge arises along with a light which by nature is able to extinguish all elaborations of duality during meditative equipoise.\\" Bodhisattvas on this level cultivate the perfection of patience. Their equanimity becomes so profound that > even if someone...cuts from the body of this bodhisattva not just flesh but > also bone, not in large sections but bit by bit, not continually but pausing > in between, and not finishing in a short time but cutting over a long > period, the bodhisattva would not get angry at the mutilator. The Bodhisattva realizes that his tormentor is motivated by afflicted thoughts and is sowing seeds of his own future suffering. As a result, the bodhisattva feels not anger, but a deep sadness and compassion for this cruel person, who is unaware of the operations of karma. Trainees on the third level overcome all tendencies toward anger, and never react with hatred (or even annoyance) to any harmful acts or words. Rather, their equanimity remains constant, and all sentient beings are viewed with love and compassion: All anger and resentment rebound on the person who generates them, and they do nothing to eliminate harms that one has already experienced. They are counterproductive in that they destroy one's peace of mind and lead to unfavorable future situations. There is nothing to be gained through anger and resentment, revenge does nothing to change the past, and so the bodhisattva avoids them. Bodhisattvas on this level also train in the four form meditations, the four formless meditations, and the four immeasurables, and the higher knowledges. = The fourth bh≈´mi, the Radiant Intellect = On the fourth level, the \\"Radiant Intellect\\", bodhisattvas cultivate the perfection of effort and eliminate afflictions. According to Wonch'uk, this level is so named because fourth bhumi bodhisattvas \\"constantly emit the radiance of exalted wisdom.\\" He also cites Maitreya's Ornament for the Mahayana Sutras, which explains that bodhisattvas on this level burn up the afflictive obstructions and the obstructions to omniscience with the radiance of their wisdom.Wongch'uk, vol. thi [119], p. 527.5. They enter into progressively deeper meditative absorptions and attain a powerful mental pliancy as a result. This eliminates laziness and increases their ability to practice meditation for extended periods of time. They destroy deeply rooted afflictions and cultivate the thirty-seven factors of awakening. Through training in these thirty-seven practices, bodhisattvas develop great skill in meditative absorptions and cultivate wisdom, while weakening the artificial and innate conceptions of true existence. = The fifth bh≈´mi, Difficult to Master = The fifth level is called the \\"Difficult to Master\\" because it involves practices that are so arduous and require a great deal of effort to perfect. It is also called the \\"Difficult to Overcome\\" because when one has completed the training of this level one has profound wisdom and insight that are difficult to surpass or undermine. According to NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, > The fifth is called the Extremely Difficult to Overcome Since all evil ones > find it extremely hard to conquer him; He becomes skilled in knowing the > subtle Meanings of the noble truths and so forth. Bodhisattvas on this level cultivate the perfection of samadhi. They develop strong powers of meditative stabilization and overcome tendencies toward distraction. They achieve mental one-pointedness and they perfect calm abiding. They also fully penetrate the meanings of the four noble truths and the two truths (conventional truths and ultimate truths) and perceive all phenomena as empty, transient and prone to suffering. = The sixth bh≈´mi, the Manifest = The sixth level is called the \\"Manifest\\" because the bodhisattva clearly perceives the workings of dependent arising and directly understands \\"the signless\\" (Mtshan ma med pa, Tibetan. Animitta, Sanskrit). The signless refers to the fact that phenomena seem to possess their apparent qualities by way of their own nature, but when one examines this appearance one realizes that all qualities are merely mentally imputed and not a part of the nature of the objects they appear to characterize. As a result of these understandings bodhisattvas manifest meditative wisdom and avoid attachment to either cyclic existence or nirvana.This explanation is given by Wonch'uk (vol. thi [119], p. 531.1, whose source is the Sutra on the Ten Bhumis Having overcome all attachments, bodhisattvas on this level can attain nirvana, but because of the force of the mind of awakening they decide to remain in the world in order to benefit other sentient beings. They cultivate the Perfection of Wisdom, through which they perceive all phenomena as lacking inherent existence, as being like dreams, illusions, reflections, or magically created objects. All notions of \\"I\\" and \\"other\\" are transcended, along with conceptions of \\"inherent existence\\" and \\"inherent nonexistence.\\" These sixth-level bodhisattvas abide in contemplation of suchness, with minds that are undisturbed by false ideas. = The seventh bh≈´mi, the Gone Afar = Bodhisattvas on the seventh level develop the ability to contemplate signlessness uninterruptedly and enter into advanced meditative absorptions for extended periods of time, thus passing beyond both the mundane and supramundane paths of ≈õrƒÅvakas and Pratyekabuddhas (Hearers and solitary realizers). For this reason, this level is called the \\"Gone Afar.\\"This explanation is given by Wonch'uk (vol. thi [119], p. 532.6), on a basis of a commentary on the Sutra on the Ten Bhumis, but he does not provide that exact title. According to NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, > The seventh is the Gone Afar because The number of his qualities has > increased, Moment by moment he can enter The equipoise of cessation, On this level bodhisattvas perfect their skill in means of meditation and practice (Thabs la mkhas pa, Tibetan; Upaya-Kausalya, Sanskrit), which is their ability to cleverly adapt their teaching tactics to the individual proclivities and needs of their audiences. They also develop the ability to know the thoughts of others, and in every moment are able to practice all the perfections. All thoughts and actions are free from afflictions, and they constantly act spontaneously and effectively for the benefit of others. = The eighth bh≈´mi, the Immovable = The eighth level is called the \\"Immovable\\" because bodhisattvas overcome all afflictions regarding signs and their minds are always completely absorbed in the dharma. At this level, a bodhisattva has achieved nirvana. According to NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, > The eighth is the Immovable, the youthful stage, Through nonconceptuality he > is immovable; And the spheres of his body, speech and mind's Activities are > inconceivable. Because they are fully acquainted with signlessness, their minds are not moved by ideas of signs. Eighth Bhumi bodhisattvas are said to be \\"irreversible\\", because there is no longer any possibility that they might waver on the path or backslide. They are destined for full buddhahood, and there are no longer any inclinations to seek a personal nirvana. They cultivate the \\"perfection of aspiration\\", which means that they undertake to fulfill various vows, due to which they accumulate the causes of further virtues.This explanation is found in the Compendium of Mahayana, p. 208. Although they resolve to work for the benefit of others and they pervade the universe with feelings of friendliness toward all sentient beings, these bodhisattvas have transcended any tendency to misunderstand anatta. Their understanding of emptiness is so complete that it overturns innate delusions, and reality appears in a completely new light. They enter into meditation on emptiness with little effort. Bodhisattvas on this level are compared to people who have awakened from dreams, and all their perceptions are influenced by this new awareness. They attain the meditative state called \\"forbearance regarding non-arisen phenomena\\", due to which they no longer think in terms of inherent causes or inherent causelessness. They also develop the ability to manifest in various forms in order to instruct others. Compassion and skillful means are automatic and spontaneous. There is no need to plan or contemplate how best to benefit others, since bodhisattvas on the eighth level automatically react correctly to every situation. = The ninth bh≈´mi, the Good Intelligence = From this point on, bodhisattvas move quickly toward awakening. Before this stage, progress was comparatively slow, like that of a boat being towed through a harbour. On the eighth through tenth bhumi, however, bodhisattvas make huge strides toward buddhahood, like a ship that reaches the ocean and unfurls its sails. On the ninth level, they fully understand the three vehicles - hearers, solitary realizers, and bodhisattvas - and perfect the ability to teach the doctrine. According to the Sutra Explaining the Thought, > Because of attaining faultlessness and very extensive intelligence in terms > of mastery of teaching the doctrine in all aspects, the ninth level is > called the \\"Good Intelligence.\\"Sutra Explaining the Thought, p. 116.3. Ninth bh≈´mi bodhisattvas also acquire the \\"four analytical knowledges\\"-of fundamental concepts, meaning, grammar, and exposition. Due to this, they develop wondrous eloquence and skill in presenting doctrinal teachings. Their intelligence surpasses that of all humans and gods, and they comprehend all names, words, meanings, and languages. They can understand any question from any being. They also have the ability to answer them with a single sound, which is understood by each being according to its capacities. On this level they also cultivate the perfection of virya, which means that because of the strength of their mastery of the four analytical knowledges and their meditation they are able to develop paramitas energetically and to practice them continually without becoming fatigued.See = The tenth bh≈´mi, the Cloud of Dharma = On the tenth bh≈´mi, bodhisattvas overcome the subtlest traces of the afflictions. Like a cloud that pours rain on the earth, these bodhisattvas spread the dharma in all directions, and each sentient being absorbs what it needs in order to grow spiritually. Thus NƒÅgƒÅrjuna states that > The tenth is the Cloud of Dharma because > The rain of excellent doctrine falls, > The Bodhisattva is consecrated > With light by the Buddhas. At this stage bodhisattvas enter into progressively deeper meditative absorptions and develop limitless powers with regard to magical formulas. They cultivate the perfection of exalted wisdom, which, according to Asa·πÖga, enables them to increase their exalted wisdom. This in turn strengthens the other perfections. As a result, they become established in the joy of the doctrine. They acquire perfect bodies, and their minds are cleansed of the subtlest traces of the afflictions. They manifest in limitless forms for the benefit of others and transcend the ordinary laws of time and space. They are able to place entire world systems in a single pore, without diminishing them or increasing the size of the pore. When they do this, the beings inhabiting the worlds feel no discomfort, and only those who are advanced bodhisattvas even notice. Bodhisattvas on this level receive a form of empowerment from innumerable buddhas. This is called \\"great rays of light\\", because the radiance of these bodhisattvas shines in all directions. This empowerment helps them in removing the remaining obstructions to omniscience and gives them added confidence and strength. At the final moment of this stage they enter into a meditative state called the \\"vajralike meditative stabilization\\", in which the subtlest remaining obstacles to buddhahood are overcome. They arise from this concentration as Buddhas.  Six bh≈´mis in the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi  The Yogacara compendium of yogic praxis, the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi contains a subsection on the bodhisattva path (the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi), which lists six bh≈´mis:Ulrich Timme Kragh (editor), The Foundation for Yoga Practitioners: The Buddhist YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi Treatise and Its Adaptation in India, East Asia, and Tibet, Volume 1 Harvard University, Department of South Asian studies, 2013, pp. 165 - 166. # The bh≈´mi of practicing with ascertainment (adhimukticaryƒÅbh≈´mi, sh√®ngjiƒõ x√≠ng d√¨ ÂãùËß£Ë°åÂú∞, mos pas spyod pa'i sa), # The bh≈´mi of pure exalted conviction (≈õuddhƒÅdhyƒÅ≈õayabh≈´mi, j√¨ng sh√®ngy√¨y√†o d√¨ Ê∑®ÂãùÊÑèÊ®ÇÂú∞, lhag pa'i bsam pa dag pa'i sa), # The bh≈´mi of accomplishing practices (caryƒÅpratipattibh≈´mi, x√≠ng zh√®ngx√≠ng d√¨ Ë°åÊ≠£Ë°åÂú∞, spyod la 'jug pa'i sa), # The bh≈´mi of certainty (niyatabh≈´mi, du√≤ ju√©d√¨ng d√¨ Â¢ÆÊ±∫ÂÆö Âú∞, nges par gyur pa'i sa), # The bh≈´mi of practicing with certainty (niyatacaryƒÅbh≈´mi, ju√©d√¨ng x√≠ng zh√®ngx√≠ng d√¨ Ê±∫ÂÆöË°åÊ≠£Ë°åÂú∞, nges pa'i spyod pa'i sa) # The bh≈´mi of reaching perfection (ni·π£·π≠hƒÅgamanabh≈´mi, d√†o ji≈´j√¨ng d√¨ Âà∞Á©∂Á´üÂú∞, mthar thug par 'gyur ba'i sa). Five Paths The bh≈´mis are often categorized with or merged into, the separate schema of the \\"five paths\\". The main ideas of this schema were inherited by Yogacara from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda VaibhƒÅ·π£ika Abhidharma texts as well as Vasubadhu's Abhidharmako≈õakƒÅrikƒÅ (AKBh).Watanabe, Chikafumi (2000), A Study of Mahayanasamgraha III: The Relation of Practical Theories and Philosophical Theories.‚Äù Ph.D. dissertation, The University of Calgary, pp. 38-40. This schema continues to be developed in Yogacara texts like Asanga's MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha (MS), where it is given a more Mahayanist explanation and becomes tied to the bodhisattva path and the bh≈´mis. The Five Paths (pa√±camƒÅrga, Wylie Tibetan lam lnga), are:Losangsamten, Introduction to the Buddhist PathWatanabe, Chikafumi, A Study of Mahayanasamgraha III: The Relation of Practical Theories and Philosophical Theories, 2000, pp. 40-65. #Mok·π£a-bhƒÅgƒ´ya (The state leading up to release) or Sa·πÉbhƒÅra-mƒÅrga (path of accumulation, tshogs lam). According to Vasubandhu's AKBh, in this path, one practices morality and contentment, learns and reflects on the teaching, keeps themselves free from unwholesome thinking, and practices the four foundations of mindfulness. In the Tibetan tradition, persons on the path are said to possess a strong desire to overcome suffering, either their own or others and renounce the worldly life. #Nirveda-bhƒÅgƒ´ya (The state leading up to penetration) or Prayoga-mƒÅrga (The path of preparation, sbyor lam). According to the AKBh, in this stage, one observes the four noble truths in terms of its sixteen aspects. In the Tibetan tradition, this path is when one begins to practice meditation and gains analytical knowledge of emptiness. #Dar≈õana- mƒÅrga (The path of seeing or insight, mthong lam). According to the AKBh, in this path one continues to observe the four noble truths until one realizes it and abandons eighty eight afflictions (kleshas). In Asanga's MS, this stage is when one realizes that all things are mere mental presentations (vij√±apti matra), which leads to the first instance of the turning of the basis (ƒÅ≈õraya- parƒÅv·πõtti). In the Tibetan tradition, this is when one practices samatha and realizes emptiness directly. #BhƒÅvanƒÅ-mƒÅrga, (The path of cultivation, sgom lam). According to the AKBh, in this stage, one continues to practice and abandons 10 further kleshas. In the MS, one practices in this stage by applying the antidotes (pratipak·π£a) to all of the obstructions (sarvƒÅ vara·πáa) and continues the process of the turning of the basis (ƒÅ≈õraya-parƒÅv·πõtti). #A≈õaik·π£ƒÅ-mƒÅrga (The path of no more learning or consummation, mi slob pa‚Äôi lam or thar phyin pa'i lam) also known as Ni·π£·π≠hƒÅ-mƒÅrga (in the MS). Persons on this path have completely freed themselves of all obstructions and afflictions and are thus perfected or fulfilled (ni·π£·π≠hƒÅ). According to the MS, one has achieved the bodies of a Buddha. = As part of the Bodhisattva path = Passage through the grounds and paths begins with Bodhicitta, the wish to liberate all sentient beings. Aspiring Bodhicitta becomes Engaging Bodhicitta upon actual commitment to the Bodhisattva vows. With these steps, the practitioner becomes a Bodhisattva, and enters upon the paths. Before attaining the ten grounds, the bodhisattva traverses the first two of the five Mahayana paths: #The path of accumulation #The path of preparation The ten grounds of the bodhisattva are grouped within the three subsequent paths: #Bh≈´mi 1: The path of seeing #Bh≈´mi 2-7: The path of meditation #Bh≈´mi 8-10: The path of no more learning In Hua-yen Buddhism there are some 40 previous stages before the first bhumi: * 10 faiths * 10 abodes * 10 practices * 10 merit-transferences In Tientai Buddhism the practitioner of the so-called \\"perfect teaching\\" is equal in attainment to arhats by just the 4th faith. Mahayana literature often features an enumeration of \\"two obstructions\\" (Wylie: sgrib gnyis): # The \\"obstructions of delusive emotions\\" (Sanskrit: kle≈õa-vara·πáa, Wylie: nyon-mongs-pa'i sgrib-ma) # The \\"obstructions to knowledge\\" (Sanskrit: j√±eyƒÅvara·πáa, Wylie: shes-bya'i sgrib-ma).Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe (Dudjom Rinpoche, author), translated and edited: Gyurme Dorje and Matthew Kapstein (1991). The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History. Boston, USA: Wisdom Publications. , p. 107(Enumerations). The obstruction of delusive emotions is overcome at the attainment of the path of seeing, and the obstructions to knowledge are overcome over the course of the path of meditation. This is not a statement agreed upon by all Buddhist schools, e.g. Korean Son's Kihwa states that the obstructions to knowledge are overcome by the 10th bhumi. Additional bh≈´mi Within the 10th bh≈´mi, various Vajrayana schools recognize 3‚Äì13 additional bh≈´mi.‰πù‰πòÊ¨°Á¨¨ËÆ∫ÈõÜ ÈôÑÂΩï ÂõõÈÉ®ÂÆó‰πâË¶ÅÁï• See also * Buddhist Paths to liberation  References  =Bibliography=  Buddhist philosophical concepts Buddhist terminology Stage theories ","title":"Bh≈´mi (Buddhism)"},{"id":"4335845","text":"\\"On Again... Off Again\\" was the Maltese entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, performed in English by Julie & Ludwig. Composed by Philip Vella and with lyrics by Gerard James Borg, the song is a combination of dance music and opera. Julie begins by describing herself as \\"a girl of serious intention\\" and telling Ludwig that \\"I need some attention\\" over a dance beat. Ludwig's response, in which he describes her as \\"everything and nothing in one\\" (eliciting Julie's question \\"What do you mean?\\") is delivered in an operatic tenor style. He goes on to wonder what the pair have in common anymore. The second verse takes much the same form, with Julie pledging her love for Ludwig, who describes her as \\"the air, you're the love that I breathe\\" and \\"the magic that flows from within\\". The duo sings the chorus in unison, describing their love as being \\"Like the rhythm of rain\\" and needing to \\"find an end to this game\\" of their mutual attraction. They describe the \\"wonderful times/Many natural highs\\" which they have experienced. At the climax of the song, Ludwig sings (in operatic style) a bridge begging Julie to \\"come across\\" the \\"river between us\\" in the name of love. The chorus is sung again, this time slower and in an operatic style by Ludwig with Julie performing vocal embellishments to the lyric. The duo then join in unison for the final chorus, which returns to the dance beat and varies the opening line to \\"Off again, on again\\", implying that they have resolved their differences. The song was autobiographical, as Julie and Ludwig were a couple in real life, whose relationship had been on and off. For their Eurovision appearance, Ludwig appeared dressed in a white shirt and black trousers, whilst Julie wore a striking pale pink gown. As Malta had not ended the 2003 contest in the top 11 (Spain as a \\"Big Four\\" member having placed in the top 10), the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed eighth, following Portugal's Sofia Vit√≥ria with \\"Foi magia\\" and preceding Monaco's M√§ryon with \\"Notre plan√®te\\". At the close of voting, it had received 74 points, placing 8th in a field of 22 and qualifying Malta for the final. In the final, it was performed sixth, following Serbia and Montenegro's ≈Ωeljko Joksimoviƒá & Ad Hoc Orchestra with \\"Lane moje\\" and preceding the Netherlands' Re-Union with \\"Without You\\". At the close of voting, it had received 50 points, placing 12th in a field of 24. Ordinarily, this would not have been enough to qualify for the next final, however both Spain and Germany (as \\"Big Four\\" members) placed in the top 10, thus allowing the 11th and 12th-place finishers to qualify automatically. It was succeeded as Maltese representative at the 2005 Contest by Chiara with \\"Angel\\".

Grausige Entdeckung. Vermisster Doktorand im Eisbach ertrunken. S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (retrieved on 15 September 2008)  Surfing on the Eisbach  Eisbach surfer Springtime Playboater on the Eisbach Just past a bridge near the Haus der Kunst art museum, the river forms a standing wave about one metre high which is a popular river surfing spot. The water is cold and shallow‚Äîsometimes only 40 cm deep‚Äîmaking it suitable only for experienced surfers and playboaters (whitewater kayakers). The wave is predominantly used by surfers, and animosities of surfers towards kayakers have occasionally been reported.e.g., 22.02.2008 - jup - Surf-Etiquette an der Eisbach-Welle in M√ºnchen (German) Surfing the Eisbach The wave has been surfed by river surfers since 1972, and surfing competitions have even been held. Due to the more recent development of playboating, kayakers have only more recently‚Äîand so far not in great numbers‚Äîstarted to surf the wave. Since 2010 surfing has been officially permitted on the river. A new sign next to the wave warns that \\"Due to the forceful current, the wave is suitable for skilled and experienced surfers only.\\" In previous years there has been an issue between the authorities, who threatened to demolish the wave, and a group of wave supporters who organized activities and a website to save the wave, including an online petition to leave the wave intact.online petition on www.rettet-die-eisbachwelle.de Being a standing wave, it can be surfed for as long as one's balance holds, and in busy times a queue of surfers forms on the bank. In the past surfers tied a leash to the bridge to hold onto, but a sign announces that this is both dangerous and forbidden. The local surfers have forced the wave to break more cleanly, with increased height, by attaching ropes to the bridge which trail submerged planks, creating two large \\"U\\"-shapes. Such a shape makes the wave easier to surf for river surfers (playboating makes fewer demands of the wave shape). There is a second standing wave on the Eisbach located a few hundred meters downstream further north in the Englischer Garten. The Eisbach is wider at this point, so the water flows more slowly and the wave is less demanding, which results in the wave being used by beginners to develop their surfing skills. Another wave for beginners is in near the Thalkirchen U-Bahn station. It has also been surfed since 1972, and it is wide enough to take a few surfers at a time. A third standing wave in Munich forms on the Isar itself near the bridge Wittelsbacherbr√ºcke, but only at flood levels of the river. Due to the dirt, manure, and objects such as tree branches drifting in the floodwater in the first days after flooding, this wave is usually surfed only a few days after the water level has risen.Isar River Surf. die Eisbach Wellenreiter am Haus der Kunst (retrieved on 15 September 2008)  Swimming in the Eisbach  Although authorities don't strictly enforce the swimming ban, they caution against the dangers even for experienced swimmers: The Eisbach has a very strong current and no affixed exit points, which makes it hard to get out again. Hence, swimmers sometimes float too far and get stuck in the lattice behind the Tivoli bridge before the hydroelectric power plant, where they must be rescued. Also, the Eisbach is shallow, which can lead to injuries not only when jumping in, but while swimming as well, also because obstacles like stones, broken glass and even disposed bicycles can be found on the ground. Lastly, even in the summer, the water doesn't get warmer than 15 ¬∞C, which harbors the risk of hypothermia.https://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/englischer-garten-warum- immer-wieder-menschen-im-eisbach-ertrinken-1.3529274 See also *List of rivers in Bavaria  References  Further reading *Eisbach NEWS and interviews with the Munich river surfing community *How to get there?

According to myth, the oar was traditionally adapted for use as a weapon of self-defense by fishermen against foes armed with more conventional weapons. When the Japanese had conquered Okinawa, their old officers taught commoners weapons use as a first line of defense against a possible Chinese invasion. Since quality weapons were expensive, the civilians had to use what equipment they had; the Ryukyu oar (in Okinawa \\"eku\\" or \\"eiku\\") came to be used in place of the naginata. Usually before learning eku properly, one has to master the bo. The eiku has a displaced center of gravity and is heavier than the bo. It is thus considered more difficult to master. Because of its weight, eku techniques often capitalize on the momentum of large circular attacks. The eku was loosely referenced in Chrono Cross, a 2000 video game for the Sony PlayStation, wherein the main character of the game used an ornate, double-ended eku as a weapon.

The two men formed the Gilbert-Robinson restaurant firm, and they opened a number of successful restaurants including Plaza III Steakhouse at the Country Club Plaza in 1963 and Gilbert & Robinson's (later renamed Sam Wilson's) on 103rd street in Overland Park. Several years later, Gilbert-Robinson looked into expanding Plaza III into space being vacated next door by men's clothing store Tom Houlihan's. Instead of expanding Plaza III, the restaurant partners decided to create a new casual restaurant. During construction, they couldn't come up with a name for the new restaurant, and people kept referring to it as Tom Houlihan's place. As a result, they decided to call the new restaurant Houlihan's Old Place. Gilbert-Robinson gained Tom Houlihan's permission to use the name, and they told him that a table would be reserved for no one else but him in the middle of the dining room every day for the rest of his life. The table included a brass plaque with Tom's name on it; however, Tom Houlihan never set foot in the restaurant. Houlihan's Old Place opened on April 1, 1972. The chain briefly held the naming rights to Tampa Stadium, home of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the late 1990s before the team moved out of the stadium. As a result of the early success of the original Houlihan's Old Place, Gilbert-Robinson quickly embarked on a plan of nationwide expansion. A second location, in the French Quarter of New Orleans, was opened in July 1973. The third location was opened in Atlanta in December 1974, and the fourth location was opened in Des Peres, Missouri in March 1975. In November 2002, Houlihan's announced that its original location at Kansas City's Country Club Plaza would close by the end of the year. The closing was announced because the landlord, Highwoods Realty LP, chose not to renew the lease. Highwoods Realty is a unit of Highwoods Properties Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns most of the retail real estate in the heart of the Country Club Plaza. A spokesperson for Highwoods released a statement indicating that \\"the time was right to bring a new concept into our restaurant mix here on the Plaza.\\" Houlihan's announced that it would relocate its Plaza location to vacant space on 53rd Street in nearby Fairway, Kansas in January 2003. At the time of the move, Houlihan's Restaurants, Inc. owned 48 restaurants in 15 states, including 34 of its Houlihan's branded restaurants. Since January 2006, private equity firm Goldner Hawn Johnson Morrison has maintained a majority ownership stake in Houlihan's Restaurants, Inc. In May 2006, Houlihan's debuted its new \\"Houlihan's of the 21st Century\\" prototype design. The new restaurant designs featured new architecture, interior design, uniforms, music, menu format, patio-style dining, and a redesign to its spacious bar area. Houlihan's also announced a new strategic growth plan to open more corporate locations and limit franchise deals to highly experienced, \\"cream of the crop\\" market developers. In 2007, 92 Houlihan's restaurants operated throughout the United States. 31 restaurants were corporate owned and 61 were franchised. By 2012, Houlihan's Restaurants, Inc. still owned 31 Houlihan's restaurants; however, franchised locations fell to 48 Houlihan's restaurants. On November 14, 2019, the restaurant chain's holding company, HRI Holding Corp., and thirty-eight affiliated companies filed bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. According to the Company's Chief Restructuring Officer, Matthew Manning, the company is struggling due to a shifting labor market, unfavorable leases and costly third-party delivery services (such as Postmates). The Company intends to use the bankruptcy process to conduct an orderly sale of the restaurants. Landry‚Äôs, a Houston-based restaurant group that operates Joe‚Äôs Crab Shack, Rainforest Cafe, and Morton‚Äôs steakhouses, has offered to pay $40 million to keep the company from bankruptcy.

Description The garfish is an unusual looking fish with many distinct features such as its elongated slender body, as well as its long lower jaw. The garfish grows up to around 40 centimeters (\\"GARFISH (GAR) (Hyporhamphus ihi) Takeke\\", 2013). The colouring of the fish allows it to appear somewhat camouflaged (Burgess, 2019); this is due to them having a greenish blue upper body with brown flecks (McMillan et al., 2011) and a silver-white belly and underbody (\\"GARFISH (GAR)\\", 2019). According to Montgomery & Saunders (1984) \\"The fish can control its coloration by expanding or reducing the pigment in the dorsal melanophores\\". They also have a long silver strip running from the top of the pectoral fin base to the tail (McMillan et al., 2011) The pectoral, dorsal, pelvic and caudal fins dusky, and the anal fin are pale (McMillan et al., 2011). The pectoral fin allows them to turn left or right, they also support the stability of the fish (Aquaveiws, 2009). The dorsal fin helps aid the fish to make sharp turns and helps the fish in rolling (Aquaveiws, 2009). The dorsal fin on the garfish is located well back on the fish (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). Unlike most fishes, the dorsal fin of the garfish lacks spines. Rather than having multiple spines running top to bottom, the dorsal fin is soft and veins of cartilage give rigidity to it when needed (Ayling & Cox, 1987). The pelvic fin aids the fish with stopping quickly and general stability, as well as diving into deeper waters and rising to the surface (Aquaveiws, 2009). The caudal fin is the main fin also known as the tail (Aquaveiws, 2009). Garfish have a caudal fin that is forked and obtains a large lower lobe, which is called the hypocercal tail (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). The anal fin on a garfish is located at the back of the body (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984); this allows them to have more stability in the water (Aquaveiws, 2009). However, their most distinctive feature is their long lower jaw with an orange tip (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). Their upper jaw is usually longer than wide and their lower jaw is usually longer than the head length (McMillan et al., 2011), which allows them to detect vibrations that are caused by their prey (Walrond, 2006). Due to their mouth posted far back from the front end of their body, \\"this places the mouth in a superior position making the garfish 'well adapted 'for surface feeding\\" (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). Another feature they obtain is the two to three rows of teeth that they have in both the upper and lower jaw (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). These type of teeth are called tricuspid, there are teeth are on both the premaxillae (which is small cranial bones at the very tip of the upper jaw(Berkovitz & Shellis, 2017) and the dentaries (which is an anterior bone of the lower jaw which is an area that bears teeth(Borgen & Nakrem, 2016). Classification The taxonomic classification of Hyporhamphus ihi is as follows: *Kingdom : Animalia *Phylum : Chordata *Subphylum : Vertebrata *Superclass : Gnathostomata *Euteleostomi : bony vertebrates *Order : Beloniformes *Family : Hemiramphidae *Genus : Hyporhamphus *Species : Hyporhamphus ihi Geographic distribution and habitat =Natural global range= The garfish is endemic to New Zealand and this particular species is only found here, however southern garfish, H. melanochir a similar species can be identified in Australia (\\"GARFISH (GAR) (Hyporhamphus ihi) Takeke\\", 2013). =New Zealand range= The garfish occurs around New Zealand as one can see from the map provided. They can also be found in the southwest Pacific and the Chatham Islands (Burgess, 2019). However, they are most common in northern and central inshore areas of New Zealand (McMillan et al., 2011). =Habitat preferences= This species is found to occupy inshore waters, in depths from 0 to a few meters (McMillan et al., 2011), such as sheltered gulfs, bays, and larger estuaries, mainly around seagrass beds or shallow waters, and over shallow reefs (McMillan et al., 2011). Although this species is widespread, it is rare and uncommon to site a garfish abundance (\\"GARFISH (GAR)\\", 2019). This is due to their localized schooling behaviour, which also makes it difficult to estimate their abundance (\\"GARFISH (GAR)\\", 2019). Life cycle The lifestyle patterns of the garfish are unknown to New Zealand in great detail; however, they may be similar to closely related species from Australia such as the southern garfish (H. melanochir) (\\"GARFISH (GAR) (Hyporhamphus ihi) Takeke\\", 2013). It is known that the New Zealand garfish matures at 22 cm and had a maximum of 40 cm, however, the maximum age may be slightly lower than 10 years (\\"GARFISH (GAR) (Hyporhamphus ihi) Takeke\\", 2013). The New Zealand garfish is known to spawn at the end of spring to around the beginning summer (MPI, 2019), this is done in shallow bays, allowing the eggs to sink to the seafloor and adhere to vegetation (\\"GARFISH (GAR) (Hyporhamphus ihi) Takeke\\", 2013). After the eggs adhere to the vegetation the larvae may be taken in coastal plankton surveys. (\\"GARFISH (GAR) (Hyporhamphus ihi) Takeke\\", 2013). It is also suspected that the garfish are less variable in comparison to other small pelagic eggs. This feature however allows localized populations, which are susceptible to local depletion (\\"GARFISH (GAR) (Hyporhamphus ihi) Takeke\\", 2013). Diet/prey/predators =Diet and foraging= Garfish are omnivorous as the feed on eelgrass, seaweed and smaller crustations (Walrond, 2006), such as zooplankton, misids, crab larvae and polychaete larvae (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). The garfish is a nocturnal planktivore however, does not rely on sight to catch prey(Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). It was seen that a tapetum was absent(Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). This means that the amount of light that can pass through the retina was not as strong as nocturnal fish that obtain this feature (Seabrook, 2008). Their pupils are small and are fully occupied by the lens (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). The garfish swims with a nearly rigid body, which has been related to its use of the lateral line in feeding (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). Due to the presence of the lateral line system and the absence of the tapetum it indicated that the beak may have had a sensory function, Smith had suggested this in 1933 according to (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). This led to the hypothesis that the garfish use their anterior lateral line system to detect prey (Montgomery & Saunders, 1984). =Predators, parasites, and diseases= Due to the garfish's localized schooling behavior, they attract bigger species of fish and mammals such as the Kingfish (Morrison, Lowe, Spong & Rush, 2007) and dolphins (Mak & Saunders, 2006). The schooling behavior of garfish also exposes them to heavy predation from sea birds such as gannets, shags and penguins. However, it is unlikely that garfish would be predated on by all three seabird species at once. The species of seabird that the garfish is subject to predation from is heavily dependent on whereabouts in the marine environment they are. Garfish schooling in shallow harbor areas are likely to be predated upon by shags, while garfish schooling in more open, deeper waters will more likely become prey for gannets/penguins (Ayling & Cox, 1987). One parasite that occurs in the garfish is the Irona Infestation Parasitic infestations; it affects females, males, and juveniles, as it inhabits an area within the gills of the fish (Fish Base, 2019). However is not fatal and does not cause mortality (Fish Base, 2019). Further information Garfish were once a staple resource for early Maori and were of high cultural significance. They were a source of food as well as an important source of bait when fishing for larger species such as yellowtail kingfish. Garfish were generally caught by dragging a finely woven flax net across Sea Grass beds in shallow harbors. A seine like technique was used where one end of the net was fixed to the shore while the other end was dragged out and around in a large arc and pulled back to shore (Paul, 2000). The same technique is still used by modern fishermen by where a fine mesh net is dragged around shallow harbors (Paul, 2000). The garfish are often kept alive and transported to other fishing grounds where they are deployed as live baits for fish such as snapper, kingfish and kahawai.

It can be played for free online at several websites, and was released for a number of platforms, including PDAs, mobile phones, and the iPod. An enhanced version, called Zuma Deluxe, was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X as well as an Xbox Live Arcade download for the Xbox 360 and a PlayStation Network download for the PlayStation 3. Zuma received the 2004 \\"Game of the Year\\" award from RealArcade. Gameplay  The objective of Zuma is to eliminate all of the balls rolling around the screen along a given path (the path is clearly visible in all of the levels except for the last level) with other balls before these balls reach the yellow skull structure, which will open to varying degrees as a warning of oncoming balls. The player can carry two balls at a time and can switch at any time. As soon as one ball reaches the skull, the rest follow and the player loses a life. To prevent the balls from reaching the skull, the player can eliminate the balls by firing a colored ball from the stone frog idol's mouth towards the chain of balls that will continue to push forward until the player fills the yellow bar, which is when the balls will stop producing off-screen. When three or more of the same color come in contact, they explode, possibly triggering other explosions as part of a chain reaction. The level is completed when after the bar is filled, the player eliminates all of the balls on the screen. There are bonuses for collecting coins (usually through gaps), for causing explosions through gaps of other balls, and chains for having a streak of always causing an explosion with each consecutive ball (coins and chain bonuses are a quick way to fill the bar). Time bonuses are also awarded if a player completes the level within ace time - ranging from thirty seconds to four minutes depending on the level. Four different types of power-ups show up in the balls, which can be activated by exploding the ball with the power-up. The backwards ball pushes the furthest-out chain (depending on if all of the balls are connected) backwards for a short length of time. The slow-down ball slows the speed of the chain of balls for a short length of time. The accuracy ball allows quicker shots and points an arrow at where the ball will be shot (this stays active for about the same amount of time as the slow-down ball; however, the size of the balls must be considered). The explosion ball explodes all of the balls within a small radius of the ball at the spot and time of its explosion. If not exploded quickly, power-up balls will return to their regular state after some time. = Adventure mode = Each regular adventure begins with three lives (represented by frogs in the upper-left hand corner of the screen), but extra lives are earned with every 50,000 points. Shooting a coin with a ball, making multiple groups of balls explode with a single shot, earning chain bonuses, shooting through gaps in the balls, or finishing a level within a certain period of time (called ace time) will give extra points. The levels are organized into temples, and the initial temple consists of three \\"worlds\\" of five levels each (the fifth level in each stage is unique in having two tracks of balls instead of the usual one). No level in the first world contains tunnels, and the first level of each world is tunnelless. Worlds one to three have four colors of balls: red, blue, green, and yellow, worlds four to six add purple, and from world seven on, white is added in the variety. Levels are eventually added to worlds: The second temple, which contains worlds four to six, has six levels, while the third temple, which contains worlds seven to nine, has seven levels. The fourth and final temple (which is hidden until a player unlocks world ten for the first time) contains worlds ten to twelve, which also consists of seven levels each. Worlds ten to twelve are essentially the same as seven to nine, but for each level, 5,000 points must be scored to completely fill the Zuma bar. Also, the balls come out further at the start of the level, and the chain of balls moves along slightly faster. If the player loses all of their lives, the game ends, and they must start again at the beginning of the last stage they advanced up. However, if the player is able to beat all 12 worlds, they are taken to the \\"Space\\" level, which is longer than all previous levels, has less color-grouping among the balls, and has no visible path for the balls to follow. This level cannot be accessed without first completing world twelve. Upon beating this level, the player wins the game (if a player fails to beat the Space level, they must beat all of world twelve again before getting another chance to win). All the remaining lives at the end of a game are each worth 50,000 additional points to add on to the final score. = Gauntlet mode = Zuma also offers the gauntlet mode, where a player can choose to play in a level they have already reached in adventure mode, and either practice to beat the level, or play in survival mode, where the difficulty in colors and speed of balls will gradually increase. The level classifications of the gauntlet mode, in order, are Rabbit, Eagle, Jaguar, and Sun God. A player is required to fill seven stages in practice mode or seven yellow bars in survival mode before advancing to the next level. Upon reaching Sun God, in which the balls move in constant speed even when nearing the skull, a player can continue endlessly, since the level classification has no limit in both stages and bars. Plagiarism controversy The Japanese developer Mitchell Corporation claims Zuma infringes on the intellectual property of their 1998 arcade game, Puzz Loop, which was released as Ballistic outside Japan. Mitchell re-released the design in 2006 as the Nintendo DS game Magnetica. PopCap asserted that Zuma was \\"not an exact clone\\", with PopCap founder Jason Kapalka saying that he was \\"happy\\" with the idea of games being cloned by other developers, so long as the new version added to the gameplay of the game it had copied. Reception The editors of Computer Gaming World nominated Zuma Deluxe as their 2004 \\"Arcade Classic of the Year\\", although it lost to Sid Meier's Pirates!. The editors of Computer Gaming World nominated Zuma for their 2003 \\"Puzzle Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Bookworm. They wrote, \\"From Bejeweled to Rocket Mania to Zuma, PopCap has constantly found new ways to spell 'addiction.' \\" Legacy A sequel, Zuma's Revenge!, was launched on September 15, 2009 for Windows and Mac. Zuma Blitz went live on Facebook on December 14, 2010, and was described by PopCap as \\"the social adaptation\\" providing players with \\"the first competitive and cooperative iteration of Zuma in the game's history.\\" See also * Luxor * Tumblebugs References 2003 video games Casual games IPod games MacOS games Mobile games IOS games Original Xbox Live Arcade games Video games involved in plagiarism controversies Palm OS games PlayStation 3 games PlayStation Network games PlayStation Portable games PopCap games Electronic Arts franchises Puzzle video games Match 3 games Video games developed in the United States Windows games Windows Mobile Professional games Xbox 360 Live Arcade games PlayStation 2 games Single-player video games ","title":"Zuma (video game)"},{"id":"4335891","text":"Bent Christensen may refer to: * Bent Christensen (director), Danish film director * Bent Christensen (footballer born 1963), Danish footballer who played four games for the Danish national team * Bent Christensen Arens√∏e, formerly known as Bent Ren√© Christensen, (born 1967), Danish football player who won the 1992 European Championship ","title":"Bent Christensen"},{"id":"4335896","text":"Giora Feidman, 2007 Giora Feidman (; born 26 March 1936) is an Argentine-born Israeli clarinetist who specializes in klezmer music.

He is the 13th president of the University of Chicago and serves as Chair of the Board for Argonne National Lab, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Marine Biological Laboratory. As a mathematician, Zimmer specializes in geometry, particularly ergodic theory, Lie groups, and differential geometry. Education and work experience Zimmer graduated from New York's Stuyvesant High School in 1964, and attended Brandeis University as an undergraduate, earning his B.A., summa cum laude, in 1968. He conducted his mathematics graduate study at Harvard University, receiving his master's degree in 1971 and his Ph.D. in 1975 under the supervision of George Mackey. Zimmer taught at the United States Naval Academy from 1975‚Äì1977, and moved to the mathematics department of the University of Chicago in 1977. From 1981 to 1983, Zimmer was a professor in the mathematics department of University of California, Berkeley. He was on the mathematics faculty and held several administrative positions at the University of Chicago, including Chairman of the Department of Mathematics, Deputy Provost, and Vice President for Research and Argonne National Laboratory before he moved to Brown University as provost in 2002. He returned to the University of Chicago as president in 2006. University of Chicago presidency As president, Zimmer pushed for major academic initiatives at Chicago, including increased financial aid for students in the undergraduate College and the elimination of loans from financial aid packages; increased funding for doctoral students, particularly in humanities and social sciences; the University of Chicago's first engineering program, which began as the Institute for Molecular Engineering and is now the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering; new programs and facilities in the arts; and the establishment of the Becker-Friedman Institute for Research in Economics, the Neubauer Family Collegium for Culture and Society, and the Stevanovich Institute on the Formation of Knowledge. During Zimmer's presidency, the University of Chicago expanded its presence locally with the launch of the Urban Education Institute and globally with the launch of the Center in Beijing, the Center in Delhi, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club University of Chicago Academic Complex  The University of Chicago Francis and Rose Yuen Campus in Hong Kong. Under Zimmer's administration applications to the undergraduate College increased from under 10,000 in 2006 to over 32,000 in 2018. The University adopted a policy of meeting full financial need of its undergraduate students with no loan expectations, creating the capacity for them to graduate debt-free. Recent efforts to increase access to the University include UChicago Promise, which provides aid and college guidance to students in the city of Chicago; the Neubauer Family Adelante Programs, which offers financial support for students engaged in Hispanic/Latino communities; the UChicago Emerging Rural Leaders Program, which offers on- campus programming, mentoring, and financial aid for students from rural communities; and the Office for Military-Affiliated Communities, which supports programs and partnerships for recruitment, enrollment and other services for veterans and their dependents. During Zimmer's tenure the University of Chicago received six gifts of $100 million or more: An anonymous $100 million donation to fund the undergraduate Odyssey scholarship program, a $300 million donation to the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, a $100 million donation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, a $150 million for the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics, $100 million for the Duchossois Family Institute: Harnessing the Microbiome and Immunity for Human Health, and a $100 million donation to found the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. In 2014, Zimmer formed the Committee on Freedom of Expression whose report came to be known as the Chicago principles ‚Äî a set of guidelines intended to demonstrate The University of Chicago's commitment to freedom of speech. The Chicago Principles were adopted by more than 65 colleges and universities. As Zimmer noted in an address to the Chicago Humanities Festival in 2017, the work of faculty and students to confront new and different ideas through education and research \\"only happens at the highest level in an environment of rigor, questioning, and free and open discourse.\\" Zimmer also spoke on the importance of these ideas in the keynote address at the University of Vienna's Academic Freedom in the Digital Age conference. Under Zimmer's guidance, the University of Chicago sent a letter to incoming freshmen in August 2016 telling them that ‚Äúwe do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.‚ÄùWhy the University of Chicago Opposes ‚ÄòTrigger Warnings‚Äô by Douglas Belkin in the Wall Street Journal, 20 February 2017 An Associated Press report found Zimmer to be the highest-paid college president in the United States in 2011, with total compensation of $3.4 million in that year. On August 13, 2020, Zimmer announced that he would step down as president at the conclusion of the 2020-2021 academic year and that he would shift to the role of chancellor.https://news.uchicago.edu/story/university-chicago-president- robert-j-zimmer-transition-role-chancellor-2021. Zimmer originally had planned to serve through 2022, but acknowledged that brain surgery he had undergone in May 2020 had accelerated his transition. Mathematical work Zimmer's work centers on group actions on manifolds and more general spaces, with applications to topology and geometry. Much of his work is in the area now known as the \\"Zimmer Program\\" which aims to understand the actions of semisimple Lie groups and their discrete subgroups on differentiable manifolds. Crucial to this program is \\"Zimmer's cocycle superrigidity theorem\\", a generalization of Grigory Margulis's superrigidity theorem. Like Margulis's work, which greatly influenced Zimmer, it uses ergodic theory as a central technique in the case of invariant measures. It led to many results within the Zimmer Program, although many of the main conjectures remain open. In addition to Margulis, Zimmer was greatly influenced by the work of Mikhail Gromov on rigid transformation groups and he extended and connected Gromov's theory to the Zimmer Program. Zimmer collaborated with a number of mathematicians to apply the ideas from the Zimmer Program to other areas of mathematics. His collaboration with Alexander Lubotzky applied some of these ideas to arithmetic results on fundamental groups of manifolds. In collaboration with Fran√ßois Labourie and Shahar Mozes, cocycle superrigidity ideas were applied to the basic problem of the existence of compact locally homogeneous spaces of certain types. His collaboration with Amos Nevo concerned actions with stationary measure and provided certain basic structure theorems for such actions of higher rank semisimple groups. Zimmer's earlier work provided a proof of a conjecture of Alain Connes on orbit equivalence of actions of semisimple groups, and introduced the basic notion of amenable group action. Personal life He was married to Terese Schwartzman, former director of strategic initiatives for the university's Urban Education Institute, but they separated in September 2009 and later divorced. They have three grown sons. In October 2011, he married University of Chicago Classics professor Shadi Bartsch.

They are credited to Jun√≠pero Serra of the Franciscan Order, who also founded important missions in Alta California. The five missions are: Santiago de Jalpan and Nuestra Se√±ora de la Luz de Tancoyol in the municipality of Jalpan, Santa Mar√≠a del Agua de Landa and San Francisco del Valle de Tilaco in Landa, and San Miguel Conc√° in Arroyo Seco. The facades of these churches are important because of the ‚ÄúMestizo Baroque‚Äù style, which shows significant indigenous influence by the Pame Indians who built them. Region The Sierra Gorda is an ecological region centered on the northern third of the state of Quer√©taro and extending into the neighboring states of Guanajuato, Hidalgo and San Luis Potos√≠ . The region is on a branch of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range and consists of a series of mountain chains that run northwest to southeast. Within Quer√©taro, the ecosystem extends from the center of the state starting in parts of San Joaqu√≠n and Cadereyta de Montes municipalities and covering all of the municipalities of Pe√±amiller, Pinal de Amoles, Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros and Arroyo Seco, for a total of 250km2 of territory. All of the Sierra Gorda is marked by very rugged terrain, which includes canyons and steep mountains. Altitudes range from just 300 meters above sea level in the R√≠o Santa Mar√≠a Canyon in Jalpan to 3,100 masl at the Cerro de la Ping√ºica in Pinal de Amoles. The micro-environments of the region range from conifer forests, oak forests, mostly found on mountain peaks, banana and sugar cane fields in the deeper canyons. On the east side, there are deciduous forests. On the west side, bordering the Mexican Plateau, there are desert and semi desert conditions, with a variety of cactus and arid scrub brush. Among its features are the peaks associated with the Sierra Alta de Hidalgo, the pine forests of Zamoarano, the Extorax Canyon and the slopes of the Huazmazonta, the inter-mountain valleys where the five missions are found and the rolling hills leading into La Huasteca. The wide variations of altitude and rainfall favor a wide variety of flora and wildlife. History Habsburg double headed eagle on the facade of the Conc√° mission Although there had been some city building in this area during the Pre Classic era, with heights between the 6th and 10th centuries, these cities had been abandoned long before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. At this time, the native peoples of the region were semi nomadic hunter gathers, such as the Pames, Ximpeces Guachichils and Jonaz, generally referred to together as the Chichimecas. In addition, there were also groups of Otomis and Huasteca to be found. The Spanish dominated the far west and the far east of the Sierra Gorda (today in the states of Guanajuato and Hidalgo), but could not dominate the center in what is now Quer√©taro. This is because the rugged terrain and fierce resistance, especially by the Jonaz. Efforts to dominate the region included evangelization efforts, many of which failed before the mid 18th century. During the 16th and 17th century, there were attempts to evangelize the Sierra Gorda of Quer√©taro by the Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans. However, almost all of these missions were never completed or were destroyed soon after they were built by the indigenous communities. The best known example is the Bucareli Mission is located in the community of Puerto de Tejamanil in the municipality of Pinal de Amoles. The mission was founded in 1797 by Franciscan Juan Guadalupe Soriano for evangelization of the local Jonaz people. The full name of the mission is the Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n de Bucarel√≠. It was never finished with only part of the monastery, the mines and the church visible. On 4 February, mass in honor of Francis of Assisi is performed here, in a small chapel with still remains, although there is no roof in any part of the complex. The mission was completely abandoned during the Mexican Revolution in 1914 and construction officially suspended in 1926. In 1740, the colonial government decided to exterminate indigenous resistance here to secure trade routes to Guanajuato and Zacatecas. This was accomplished by Jos√© de Escand√≥n, whose expedition culminated in the Battle of Media Luna, defeating the Jonaz and Ximpeces. The military pacification of the area by Jos√© de Escand√≥n in the 1740s allowed for the building of permanent missions in the heart of the Sierra Gorda. However, the five Franciscans missions accredited to Jun√≠pero Serra were built in Pame territory, as these people were more accepting of Spanish domination. The Spanish decided to burn original Pame villages and resettle the population around missions for better control. Those who did not submit either committed suicide or went to live in the mountains. The placement of the missions had the purpose of dividing the heart of the Sierra Gorda and to open roads into San Luis Potos√≠. Jun√≠pero Serra spent eight years on the project of building the missions until 1770, when a number of historical events, including the expulsion of the Jesuits, forced the abandonment of the missions. Serra moved onto California. From then until the late 20th century, the complexes suffered abandonment, deterioration and damage. This was especially true during the Mexican Revolution with many churches in the region were sacked and a number of portal figures on these Franciscan churches became ‚Äúdecapitated‚Äù by the fighting. In the 1980s, a group from the Xilitla office of INAH got lost in the area and came upon one of the missions. The find led to efforts to save the missions and culminated with their declaration as a World Heritage Site in 2003. Initial restoration work to the structure and exterior of the mission churches was begun in the 1980s. Between 1991 and 1997, interior work on altars, choirs, organs and paintings was done. Further work was sponsored by the state between 1997 and 2002, which included that on surrounding plazas and monuments. Restoration costs for the Tancoyol mission alone were over three million pesos by 2008. The effort to inscribe the missions as a World Heritage Site began in 2000 by a group of Mexican intellectuals including Dr. Miguel Le√≥n Portilla. The effort took two and a half years but was ultimately successful in 2003, when it was added during the 27th meeting of the World Heritage Committee. The five missions are promoted by the state tourism authority as the Ruta de las Misiones, (Mission Route) . Missions Mission at Tancoyol Facade of San Miguel Conc√° Portal at the mission in Tilaco Although the mission in Jalpan was established before Jun√≠pero Serra‚Äôs 1750 arrival into the region, Serra is given credit for building the five main missions of this area and completing the evangelization of the local people. In reality, the missions were built by Pame hands, under the direction of various Franciscan monks including Jos√© Antonio de Murgu√≠a in Conc√°, Juan Crispi in Tilaco, Juan Ramos de Lora in Tancoyol and Miguel de la Campa in Landa. However, the vision for the building of the missions was Serra‚Äôs, as he imagined a type of utopia based on Franciscan principles. Serra insisted that the missionaries learn the local languages and experience hunger along with the rest of the population. There was still hostility to the Spanish presence, and Serra‚Äôs response was economic as well as spiritual. The main feature of these churches is the ornate decoration of the main portals, although there is decoration on the bell towers and in some churches, other areas as well. This decoration is termed ‚ÄúMestizo Baroque‚Äù or ‚Äúmestizo architecture‚Äù according to INAH . The ornate decoration is primarily aimed at teaching the new religion to the indigenous peoples, but unlike even the Baroque works further south, indigenous influence is obvious as the Serra‚Äôs idea was to demonstrate a blending of cultures rather than complete conquest. One element is the use of red, orange, and yellow, including pastel shades, and native sacred figures such as the rabbit and jaguar, appear. The mission churches have a single nave, covered by a cannon vault, but each has its own peculiarities, especially in the portals. Serra spent eleven years in the Sierra Gorda before moving north in the late 1760s. The missions established in Quer√©taro would be the first of a long series of missions that would be established as the Spanish made their way north into what is now southern California. The Santiago mission in Jalpan was established before the arrival of Jun√≠pero Serra in 1744, but Serra was in charge of building the mission complex that stands today from 1751 to 1758, the first to be built. It is dedicated to James the Greater, the first evangelist. This complex is situated in the center of the modern town in front of the main plaza and formed by an atrium, cloister, pilgrim portal and church, with a chapel annex on the left side. The original atrium wall was lost, but reconstructed in the same style, with three portals and inverted arches. The main features of the ornate portal on the facade are Our Lady of the Pillar and the Virgin of Guadalupe, both with Mesoamerican connections, as well as a double headed eagle, meant to symbolize the blending of the two cultures. The facade is elaborately done in stucco and stone work, with ochre of the pilasters contrasting with the yellow of many of the decorative details. Much of the detail is vegetative, along with small angels and eagles. European elements include images of saints such as Saint Dominic and Francis of Assisi and the Franciscan coat of arms. Inside the door, there are the images of Saints Peter and Paul. Native elements include a double-headed Mexican eagle devouring a serpent. On the upper left, there is an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the upper left, the Our Lady of the Pillar. These are the virgin images of Mexico and Spain respectively. This statue is said to have been taken by a general at the end of the 19th century. It was replaced by a more modern clock. Inside, the cupola of the Jalpan mission contains scenes of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. A second mission is located in the community of Tancoyol called Nuestra Se√±ora de la Luz de Tancoyol, dedicated to Our Lady of Light. This facade has profuse vegetative ornamentation, with ears of corn prominent and is the most elaborate of the five missions. It is likely that this mission was constructed by Juan Ramos de Lora, who resided here from 1761 to 1767. The structure is similar to those in Jalpan and Landa. It has a church with a Latin cross layout and choir area, a sacristy, atrium with cross and chapels in the corners of the atrium called ‚Äúcapillas posas.‚Äù There is also a pilgrims‚Äô gate, a cloister and quarters for the priest. The interior has a number of sculptures including one of ‚ÄúOur Lady of Light.‚Äù The facade is marked by a rhomboid window surrounded by a representation of the cord Franciscans use to tie their habits. The basic theme of the facade is mercy, represented by interventions by the Virgin Mary and various saints. The iconography of this portal is the most elaborate of the five missions. The facade consists of three bodies, a pediment and four est√≠pite columns. The lower body has sculptures of Saints Peter and Paul and who Franciscan coats of arms. The second body has sculptures of Joachim and Saint Anne, with the Virgin Mary in her arms, and a niche in the center. There are also images from the Passion such as nails and a lance. This niche contained an image of Our Lady of Light, but it is empty now. Between the second and third bodies, there is a large window and above it, a representation of the stigmata of Francis of Assisi. The pediment contains a large cross in relief of two styles related to the Franciscan and Dominican orders. The main cross at the top represents redemption with the crosses of Calatrava and Jerusalem on either side. Indigenous elements are found in the church‚Äôs interior, with an image of a jaguar and a person with Olmec features. The bell tower is narrow and the baptistery is at the base of this tower. On the lower part appears a small window which illuminates the baptistery. The cupola of the tower is in a pyramid shape with a Baroque iron cross on top. Indigenous influence is noted in the interior columns of the church, which have images of a jaguar and a person with Olmec features. San Miguel Conc√° is located forty km from Jalpan on Highway 69 to R√≠o Verde. The church is in the center of the community on one side of Guerrero Street. It is oriented to the south and dedicated to the Archangel Michael. It is the smallest of the mission churches and was probably finished in 1754, according to an inscription located inside the church. Conc√° is a Pame word which means ‚Äúwith me.‚Äù San Miguel Conc√° is the furthest north and the smallest of the missions. The decoration features large flowers, foliage and coarse figures in indigenous style. It is distinguished by an image of the Holy Trinity at the crest along with a rabbit (a Pame symbol) and double-headed eagle. San Francisco del Valle de Tilaco is in a small community eighteen km northeast of Landa de Matamoros. It was constructed between 1754 and 1762 by Juan Crespi and dedicated to Francis of Assisi . It has some characteristics different from the other missions. First, it is built on a gradient. The bell tower is separated from the main nave of the church by the baptistery and structurally functions as a buttress for the church. Tilaco is the best conserved of the five missions and has the most subtle ornamentation on its facade. Its facades are composed of three horizontal and three vertical partitions, with the Franciscan coat of arms prominent over the main entrance. In Tilaco, the facade has small angels, ears of corn and a strange large jar over which is an image of Francis of Assisi. One distinctive decorative element is four mermaids with indigenous features. Tilaco has the best conserved atrium corner chapels called ‚Äúcapillas posas,‚Äù which were used for processions. Santa Mar√≠a del Agua de Landa is located twenty km from Jalpan on Highway 120 towards Xilitla. The mission was built between 1760 and 1768 by Miguel de la Campa is dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, which gives rise to part of the community‚Äôs name. It was the last of the missions to be built. The atrium is bordered by a wall and centered by a cross, and paved in stone. It is noted for its equilibrium in composition and very narrow bell tower, which is integrated into the facade. The sculpture of this facade is considered to be the best of the five according to Arqueolog√≠a Mexicana magazine. The faces of the mermaids at Landa have indigenous features.

Karl Spencer Lashley defined equipotentiality as \\"The apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional brain to carry out‚Ä¶ the [memory] functions which are lost by the destruction of [other parts]\\".Fancher, R.E., & Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of Psychology. New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Company, Inc. In other words, the brain can co-opt other areas to take over the role of the damaged part.Garrett, H. (1941). R. Elliott (Ed.), Great experiments in psychology, New York: D. Appleton-century Company. Equipotentiality is subject to the other term Lashley coined, the law of mass action. The law of mass action says that the efficiency of any complex function of the brain is reduced proportionately to how much damage the brain as a whole has sustained, but not to the damage of any particular area of the brain. In this context when we use brain we are referring to the cortex. Historical context In the 1800s brain localization theories were the popular theories on how the brain functioned. The Broca's area of speech was discovered in 1861, in 1870 the cerebral cortex was marked as the motor center of the brain, and the general visual and auditory areas were defined in the cerebral cortex.Hearst, E. (1979). The first century of experimental psychology. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum associates, Inc. Behaviorism at the time would also say that learned responses were series of specific connections in the cerebral cortex. Lashley argued that one would then be able to locate these connections in part of the brain and he systematically looked for where learning was localized. Experiments While working on his PhD in genetics, Lashley began a number of tests on brain tissue and the idea of localization. Lashley wanted to focus mainly on behaviors that could be observed and an easy way to do that was to study white rats in a controlled setting. A fellow researcher, Shepherd Ivory Franz, also shared the common interest of studying localization and studying only things that could be observed. Franz had already done previous work with lesions in cat brains and puzzle boxes so Lashley and Franz decided to team up and work with rats. In their first experiments, Lashley was in charge of building different mazes for the rats to go through and Franz was in charge of making the lesions in the rats' brains. What Lashley and Franz had both observed before the lesions was that their rats became better and better at getting through the mazes to find food and they were testing if lesions had an influence on the rats' memory and ability to get through the mazes. Franz made multiple lesions in specific parts of the brains and after they healed, put them through the maze to see if they had deficits in finding the food. What they found was that the mice had no deficits finding the food if the lesions were in a specific part of the brain but if the lesions damaged a large portion of the brain, they did have troubles finding food. This would suggest that just one part of the brain is not responsible for memory and localization was totally ruled out. What they concluded was that multiple parts of the brain work together for memory and retention. They also found that rats with lesions in a small specific area had functioning sensory systems and it seemed that when parts of the brain were damaged for a certain action, other parts of the brain were compensating so those actions could be carried out. Lashley coined the term equipotentiality to define the idea that if one part of the brain is damaged, other parts of the brain will carry out the memory functions for that damaged part. \\"The apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional brain to carry out‚Ä¶ the [memory] functions which are lost by the destruction of [other parts]\\". Another way of putting this is, the brain has the ability to use any functioning part of the brain to do what a damaged part of the brain no longer can do. Equipotentiality is subject to the other term Lashley coined the mass action principle. This principle postulates that the efficiency of any complex function of the brain is reduced proportionately to how much damage the brain as a whole has sustained, but not to the damage of any particular area of the brain. In this context when we use brain we are referring to the cortex. Ghiselli and Brown conducted an experiment where they destroyed various subcortical regions of the brain in rats and tested their abilities to learn mazes compared to rats with no damage done to their brains. The rats with damaged brains didn't learn as well as the control rats, but no particular region seemed to be necessary to learn the mazes. There has also been experimental work done on higher apes and also studies done on humans who have suffered brain damage in various ways. The data gathered from these tend to confirm Lashley's theories.Dewsbury, D. A. (2006). Monkey farm: a history of the yerkes laboratories of primate biology, orange park, florida 1930-1965. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=pGo606UrQhgC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PA7&dq;=yerkes laboratories&ots;=FPcTjpGCwA&sig;=wkwPpFDSPI20sYC-feSaPG8oswE Using the idea of equipotentiality we can explain how someone who's received damage to a specific part of their brain can relearn how to perform actions that were lost due to brain damage. Since the area of the brain that was originally performing this function is damaged and unusable, the brain compensates and can code that information in other parts of the brain. Through Lashley's ideas of equipotentiality and the law of mass action, he is saying that the brain is functioning as a whole unit and that over all damage to the brain effects it's over all functioning. This starts to go against localization theories which would say that the brain is only functioning in specific regions and the brain's ability to perform at any given task is only effected by the overall damage to that area of the brain and damage to an unrelated area shouldn't affect the task. However, equipotentiality and the law of mass action don't mean that there is no localization. There are certain functions that have been pinned to specific parts of the brain, language and the senses for example, but for things like learning or behavior there is no specific area identified yet, and these are the brain activities that have the flexibility to be coded in different areas of the brain after damage has been sustained. =In neuropsychology= In neuropsychology, equipotentiality is a neurological principle that describes a cortical mechanism, first identified by Jean Pierre Flourens and later revisited by Karl Lashley in the 1950s. The principle of equipotentiality is the idea that the rate of learning is independent of the combination of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli that are used in classical conditioning. After performing ablation experiments on birds, and seeing that they could still fly, peck, mate, sleep, and perform a range of other regular behaviors, Flourens concluded that every area of the brain was capable of doing what every other area of the brain could, but only for higher-level functions which he called \\"perception\\". He also argued that elementary sensory input was localized, which is supported by current research. The famous saying that we only use 10% of our brains originates from Flourens, back about a century and a half ago. Lashley offered two generalizations from his research, that recently have been successfully challenged but nonetheless represent important milestones in the development of neurological theory: # Although surgical removal of a portion of the cortex can produce significant behavioral deficits, those deficits can be recovered through additional training and time, by way of the development of new neuronal connections. Lashley argued that the brain is sufficiently plastic, such that when one region of the brain is surgically removed (or damaged through injury) another region takes over the damaged region's function. This is the principle Lashley referred to as equipotentiality. Extensive regions of the cerebral cortex have the potentiality for mediating specific learning and memory functions. # His principle of \\"mass action\\" stated that the cerebral cortex acts as one‚Äîas a whole‚Äîin many types of learning. =In behaviorism= In behaviorism, the theory of equipotentiality suggests that any two stimuli can be associated in the brain, regardless of their nature. It proposes that all forms of associative learning, both classical (Pavlovian) and operant (Skinnerian) involve the same underlying mechanisms. However, food avoidance and fear conditioning experiments have questioned its application.Garcia, J. & Koelling, R. A. (1966). Relation of cue to consequence in avoidance learning. Psychonomic Science, 4, 123-124. Contributions Lashley contributed to psychology and neuropsychology in a number of ways. First, his publication, Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence: A Quantitative Study of Injuries to the Brain (1929) found evidence to suggest the idea of localization was wrong and brought to life the idea that the brain and its multiple parts work together for memory and other functions.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. (2013). Karl S. Lashley. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved November 21, 2013 from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330978/Karl-S-Lashley Second, researchers began to copy his studies and also started to investigate what parts of the brain work together. They also began studying deficits people may have along with parts of their brain that may be damaged to see if there is a correlation between them. Lashley was also a pioneer in challenging the way we think about human and animal behavior in terms of our biology. Lashley found with further experimentation that behavior is not just a reaction to a stimulus but a large and complicated series of connections made in the brain. An input of information or stimuli occurs and connections occur in the brain which leads to the output or behavior. Researchers also expanded the study of working memory, central executive, and further research on memory deficits and learning. Lashley did not find a central place for stored memories, which suggests that stored memories are not localized but stored and retrieved in multiple areas. Lashley contributed to studies on Alzheimer's disease and deficits in memory, behavior, and thinking in those who have Alzheimer's disease.B. Davis. (2008). Karl Spencer Lashley. Encyclopedia.com.

From 1957 until 1965 she made regular patrols, ready to provide early warning in the event of an enemy attack. Lansing participated in the atomic tests at Johnston Island in the summer of 1958 and again in the fall of 1962. She sailed on Far East cruises during 1961 and 1963 and engaged in search operations for a downed Air Force Globemaster in January 1964. Fate Arriving Bremerton, Washington, 22 February 1965, Lansing decommissioned there 21 May and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

The highway runs between the towns of Pinehurst and Southern Pines connecting NC 5 with US 1. Much of the routing is known as Midland Road, a four lane road connecting the two towns. NC 2 was commissioned between 1930 and 1935 as a new routing running from US 220 in Candor to US 1 in Southern Pines. The western end of the route was truncated in US 15/US 501 in 1940 with much of the former route to the west becoming NC 211. In 1952, NC 2 replaced its former bannered route, NC 2A along Yadkin Road to US 1 in Manly. The route was extended west to NC 211 (present day NC 5) along its former routing through Pinehurst, in 1957. NC 2 was truncated in 1967 to the US 1 Bypass that was built around Southern Pines. Route description NC 2 begins at an intersection with NC 5 (Beulah Hill Road), just south of downtown Pinehurst. The route follows Cherokee Road to the northeast through a residential section of the town before meeting a traffic circle. Continuing across the circle the road continues to follow Cherokee Street until meeting Azalea Road. At the intersection the street name changes to Azalea Road, and begins a turn toward the southeast. NC 2 turns northeast onto Palmetto Road near the Pinehurst Golf Course. It continues to follow Palmetto Road along the western side of the golf course. Palmetto Road turns slightly to the northeast before widening to a 4 lane road and becoming Midland Road. NC 2 meets up with US 15/US 501 and NC 211 at a traffic circle east of a shopping district. The road continues straight across the circle and continues on Midland Road. Midland Road crosses through a residential area west of Pinehurst before entering into the town of Southern Pines. NC 2 turns to the southeast before intersecting the southern terminus of NC 22 at Central Drive. The road then crosses McDeeds Creek before reaching its eastern terminus at an interchange with US 1. History NC 2 was established sometime before 1935 running from US 220 in Candor east to US 1 in Southern Pines. The route ran southeast from Candor through the communities of Samarcand and Eagle Spurs to US 15 in West End. It then followed along a concurrency with US 15 to the southeast to US 15/US 501/NC 211 in Pinehurst. After briefly following concurrently along US 15/US 501 to the north, the road turned east until reaching its terminus at US 1 in downtown Southern Pines. In 1940, NC 2 was truncated to US 15/US 501 in Pinehurst, at the intersection of Midland Road and Page Road. The route to the west was resigned as NC 211. In 1952, NC 2A was decommissioned and NC 2 was routed along its former routing to US 1. The new routing brought NC 2 along Yadkin Road, further to the north of downtown Southern Pines. The former alignment into downtown became part of NC 22, however currently exists only as a secondary road. In 1957, NC 2 was extended west to NC 211 (present-day NC 5) in southern Pinehurst. The new routing followed along the roads previous routing which was decommissioned in 1940. Much of the routing is the same as in present day, however the formation of the golf courses adjacent of the road may have shifted some alignments. It was truncated in 1967 to the US 1 Bypass creating the current eastern terminus of the road. Major intersections Related route NC 2A was established in late 1941 running from NC 2 northeast of downtown Southern Pines, north of the town to US 1 in Manly. In 1952, NC 2A was decommissioned and NC 2 took over its routing to US 1.

It is in size. The island is owned by the U.S. state of Michigan and is managed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources as part of the Beaver Islands State Wildlife Research Area. High Island got its name from a large, perched sand dune on the western side of the island. The sand, blown by the lake's prevailing winds, has piled up into a sand dune elevated 780 feet (238 m) above sea level, or 199 feet (61 m) above the level of Lake Michigan. The island is currently uninhabited. It lies approximately four miles (6 km) west of the much larger Beaver Island, and less than two miles from Trout Island. History High Island was the home of a timber-cutting and truck farm operation run in 1912-1927 by the House of David, a millenarian sect based in Benton Harbor, Michigan. The High Island farm grew large quantities of potatoes and other root crops much valued by the House of David congregation, who were vegetarians. The House of David era created intense interest among gentile neighbors, partly because members of the sect had been required to take a vow of celibacy prior to admission. The group largely abandoned its High Island operations in 1927 as the result of a sexual scandal involving sect leader Benjamin Purnell. The House of David population of High Island, at its peak, was 120 to 150 persons, who lived in a village near High Island Bay on the east side of the island. Before, during, and after the House of David era, High Island was the home of several extended families of Ottawa (Odawa) Native Americans, who were fishermen. The island supported a public school as late as 1936.Carl A. Norberg, \\"Lost Treasure of the Beaver Island Mormon Colony\\", Inland Seas 43:2 (Fall 1987), pages 188-93. However, fish yield in the Beaver Island archipelago began dropping sharply in the 1930s, and after the Armistice Day Blizzard of 1940, the remaining Odawa moved to Beaver Island. The DNR has a couple of abandoned cabins on the island that have not been used by the agency since at least 2008. The only remaining trail head that is not overgrown starts in close proximity to the cabins. The cabins are named alpha and omega. They are in disrepair. The roofs leak, the windows/doors are not completely intact. Research teams spent time in the cabins years ago and there are some old remnants of that habitation which includes propane lights and appliances, some miscellaneous food and survival items.Beaver Archipelago, Pt. 2: \\"A Cult Classic\\" Biology High Island's Great Sand Bay, on the western side of the island, is one of the last suitable Great Lakes nesting sites for the endangered piping plover. Many terns breed on a sandspit on the northeast corner of the island. Folklore The royal treasury of the Kingdom of Beaver Island, ruled by James Jesse Strang until he was shot in June 1856, is thought by some to have been secreted on High Island. After Strang was badly wounded by an assassin, he was taken to Wisconsin for medical treatment, and it is thought that one of Strang's followers secreted the treasure at that time. Strang's care was not successful, and the crowned king of Beaver Island died of his wounds. The treasure is said to have been buried 30 paces from a \\"large tree\\", easily noticeable in 1856 from its prominent location overlooking the island's northeast harbor. High Island was logged shortly after this 1856 incident, thereby removing a landmark vital to the recovery of the alleged treasure. As of 1987 the treasure had not been recovered.

Together with the Utopia series of the rival publisher Erich Pabel Verlag, Rastatt the Terra series were the most important science fiction work in the early years of West Germany.  Dime novels  In 1957 Moewig started the weekly series Terra - Utopische Romane / Science Fiction, later renamed Terra SF, then only Terra'. For this venture some writers were poached from competitor Pabel, e.g. the editor and author Walter Ernsting, editor G√ºnther M. Schelwokat and cover painter Johny Bruck. In September 1962 Terra SF was supplemented by the reprint series Terra Extra. From that date onward Terra SF and Terra Extra were published in weekly rotation. In 1968 both series were combined into the new weekly series Terra Nova, which later was replaced by Terra Astra'. Publication history *Terra SF: 1957-68, 555 issues *Terra Extra: 1962-68, 182 issues *Terra Nova: 1968-71, 190 issues *Terra Astra: 1971-86, 643 issues  Sonderband / Taschenbuch  In 1958 Moewig started the series Terra Sonderband (\\"special issue\\"). Each issue of Sonderband had 100 pages, allowing more room to publish more challenging novels than within the dime novel format. With issue #99 (1965) Terra Sonderband was renamed to Terra Taschenbuch (\\"paperback\\"), and published in paperback format.  Subseries, spin-offs and more  The Terra series included some subseries of different German and international authors. For example, Isaac Asimov's Foundation series was published as Der 1000 Jahres Plan (The 1000 Year Plan) in issues 22/24/26/28, while E.E. Smith's Lensmen was published in Terra SF #199-222). In 1968/69 adaptations of the seven episodes of the television series Raumpatrouille, plus five original stories, were published in Terra Taschenbuch. Additional new episodes (#13-35) were printed as separate paperback series. Since 1972 the episodes were reprinted and continued within Terra Astra, outsourced to a separate dime novel series and finally again reintegrated into Terra Astra (145 volumes in total). From March 1958 until May 1959 Moewig published 15 issues of the magazine Galaxis- Magazin, the German version of the American magazine Galaxy Science Fiction. In 1961 Moewig started the space opera series Perry Rhodan which originally was written by K. H. Scheer, Walter Ernsting and other Terra related authors.

Within Quer√©taro, the ecosystem extends from the center of the state starting in parts of San Joaqu√≠n and Cadereyta de Montes municipalities and covering all of the municipalities of Pe√±amiller, Pinal de Amoles, Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros and Arroyo Seco, for a total of 250 km2 of territory. The area is extremely rugged with high steep mountains and deep canyons. As part of the Huasteca Karst, it also contains many formations due to erosion of limestone, especially pit caves known locally as s√≥tanos. The area is valued for its very wide diversity of plant and animal life, which is due to the various microenvironments created by the ruggedness of the terrain and wide variation in rainfall. This is due to the mountains‚Äô blocking of moisture coming in from the Gulf of Mexico, which generally makes the east side fairly moist and the west semiarid scrub brush. Most of the region has been protected in two biosphere reserves, with the one centered in Quer√©taro established in 1997 and the one centered in Guanajuato established in 2007. The Sierra Gorda is considered to be the far west of the La Huasteca region culturally and it is home to the Franciscan Missions in the Sierra Gorda World Heritage Site. Region Mountains at the junction of the Arroyo and Jalpan Rivers in Arroyo Seco Semidesert and mountains in the municipality of Pe√±amiller The region is on a branch of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range and consists of a series of mountain chains that run northwest to southeast, formed 240 million years ago. Most are made of limestone, formed by sea beds from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Later there were intrusions of volcanic rock, especially in the eastern portion in Hidalgo state, from which come the mineral deposits of the area. The limestone has been affected by erosion to form the Huasteca Karst, and the area contains a large number of caverns, and pit caves (s√≥tanos), some of which extend for hundreds of meters in depth. All of the Sierra Gorda is marked by very rugged terrain, which includes canyons and steep mountains. Altitudes range from just 300 meters above sea level in the R√≠o Santa Mar√≠a Canyon in Jalpan to 3,100 m asl at the Cerro de la Ping√ºica in Pinal de Amoles. The most important elevation in the Hidalgo area is the Cerro Cangandh√≥ which has an altitude of 2,820 m asl. Rainfall also varies greatly from 350 mm to 2,000 mm per year. The micro- environments of the region range from conifer forests, oak forests, mostly found on mountain peaks, banana and sugar cane fields in the deeper canyons. On the east side, there are deciduous forests. On the west side, bordering the Mexican Plateau, there are desert and semi desert conditions, with a variety of cacti and arid scrub brush. Among its mountains are the peaks associated with the Sierra Alta de Hidalgo, the pine forests of Zamoarano, the Extoraz Canyon and the slopes of the Huazmazonta, the inter-mountain valleys where the five missions are found and the rolling hills leading into La Huasteca. The wide variations of altitude and rainfall favor a wide variety of flora and wildlife. There are three main rivers in the Sierra Gorda, all of which are part of the P√°nuco River basin. These are the Santa Mar√≠a River, the Extoraz or Pe√±amiller River and the Moctezuma River. All three pass through deep canyons and tend to form borders between the states and municipalities of the region. Santa Mar√≠a marks part of the border between Quer√©taro and San Luis Potos√≠, and the Moctezuma River marks part of the border between Quer√©taro and Hidalgo. The Tula and Moctezuma Rivers meet in the Sierra Gorda of Hidalgo. Here, the Moctezuma River Canyon extends for twelve km and rises 480 meters above the floor. The climate of the region depends on altitude and the fact that the mountains form a natural barrier against the prominent source of moisture, the Gulf of Mexico. The east side of the mountains gets significant more rainfall than the west, as the altitude extracts moisture from the clouds. Forests and even rainforests are found in the east, while the west is dominated by desert and near desert conditions. In the east, mornings in the high mountain areas usually bring cloud cover and fog. The most moisture falls in the northeastern edges of the regions, where it merges into La Huasteca proper, in San Luis Potos√≠ and Hidalgo. In the entire region, the coldest temperatures occur between December and January, with high temperatures in April and May. Temperatures vary widely depending on altitude with an annual average of 13 ¬∞C in the higher elevations such as Pinal de Amoles to 24 ¬∞C in lower areas such as Jalpan. In the highest elevations, frosts and freezes are not uncommon. In 2010, the Sierra Gorda had it first significant snowfall in eighteen years in the municipality of Pinal de Amoles, with temperatures of ‚àí4 ¬∞C. In some places, the cover was 15 cm deep. Because of its great variety of ecosystems, the Sierra Gorda has one of the diverse ecologies in Mexico, with one of the largest number of species of plants and animals. Species in danger of extinction include the jaguar, puma, the black bear, the green parrot, the Veracruz partridge, and the Humboldt butterfly, mostly due to human activities. Endangered plant species include the biznaga gigante (Echinocactus platyacanthus), the chapote (Diospyros riojae), the guayam√© (Abies guatemalensis), the magnolia (Magnolia dealbata) and the peyote (Lophophora diffusa). monarch butterflies can be found in the area as well, as they pass through to their wintering grounds on the State of Mexico-Michoac√°n border . There have been plagues in the forests of the area due to the recent drought conditions. The most serious is a bark beetle (Dendroctonus adjunctus) and mistletoe (Arceuthobium sp.). The drought conditions have been blamed on global climate change. Areas in Quer√©taro and Guanajuato have been declared as biosphere reserves. The Sierra Gorda in Hidalgo has not, but it still contains a large number of important ecosystems. Poverty levels are high in the area despite the ecological and cultural richness. A number of indigenous communities still inhabit the region. The eastern part in Hidalgo is dominated by the Otomi . The far north of Quer√©taro still has significant communities of Pames, and Guanajuato has a number of Chichimeca groups. Tourism has been a recent phenomenon here, as the area's ecological importance becomes more widely known. In Jalpan de Serra, there is a museum dedicated to the history and geography of the Sierra Gorda region. The museum building was first constructed in 1576 as a fort and military outpost. It was reconstructed at the end of the 16th century. It was remodeled in 1990 and was inaugurated as a museum in 1991, with a collection of pieces that range from the pre Hispanic era to the Reform War. It has eight halls for exhibits, a bookstore, an audiovisualroom, a temporary exhibit hall, research center and library. It organizes educational, ecological and cultural events. There is an annual cycling event called \\"Escalera del Infierno\\" (Hell's Ladder) which extends over the Sierra Gorda in Quer√©taro in March. The event begins in Bernal, through Ezequiel Montes, Cadereyta and ends in San Joaqu√≠n, for 137 km, 28 km of which are uphill. Biosphere reserves There are two major conservation areas in the Sierra Gorda region: one in Quer√©taro and one in the state of Guanajuato. =Biosphere reserve in Quer√©taro= Map of the Sierra Gorda region in Quer√©taro The Sierra Gorda Biosphere in Quer√©taro was established by decree on May 19, 1997 because of its exceptional variety of species and ecosystems. The reserve extends for about 400,000 hectares over the states of Quer√©taro and San Luis Potos√≠ . It covers about 32% of the state of Quer√©taro and is roughly the size of Rhode Island . When it was declared, the reserve had 683 communities with about 100,000 inhabitants. However, since then, the population has nearly dropped to about half. In Quer√©taro, the biosphere reserve encompasses the municipalities of Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros, Arroyo Seco, Pinal de Amoles (88% of its territory) and Pe√±amiller (69.7% of its territory) . The biosphere was declared as a result of grassroots efforts, the only one to be established this way in Mexico. The original declaration encompasses 383.567 hectares. In 2001, it was added to the International Networks of Man and Biosphere of UNESCO as the thirteenth Mexican reserve on the list, occupying first place in regards to ecodiversity. It is also recognized as a √Årea de Importancia para la Conservaci√≥n de las Aves (Area of Importance for the Conservation of Birds) by the Consejo Internacional para la Preservaci√≥n de las Aves Mexicanas. The reserve begins in the dry semi desert areas in the center of Quer√©taro and as one moves north and higher into the mountain peaks of Pinal de Amoles at around , the scenery changes to temperate forest of conifers. Altitude lowers north into Jalpan and the climate is warmer and wetter before moving into the rolling hills of the La Huasteca in San Luis Potos√≠ and Hidalgo. The ecosystems of the reserve are found at altitudes between 350 and 3,100 meters above sea level, with rugged mountains, canyons, lush valley and ‚Äús√≥tanos‚Äù or pit caves carved out from the limestone of the Huasteca Karst . Humidity is primarily from the Gulf of Mexico, which makes the northeast of the region green, but the southwest, blocked from the moisture by the high mountains, is dominated by arid scrub brush. This combination of varying altitude and moisture patterns creates the regions primary biological characteristic, which is a large number of ecosystems in a relatively small area. It has 15 vegetative types, including old growth moist montane forests covered in bromeliads and orchids, high elevation pine-oak forests, a great diversity of cactus, wild oregano and lowland tropical forests . The biosphere is the seventh largest federally protected natural area and has the greatest biodiversity of all of them, including those which encompass marine areas, as it is home to 10 of Mexico's 11 ecosystems. The diversity of the area can also be seen in the number of plant and animals species found in the reserve. There are 2,308 species of plants, . with about thirty five percent of the area covered by forested areas of oaks, junipers and pines. There are 130 mammal, 71 reptile and 23 amphibian species, including six feline species, the black bear (Ursus americanus) the spider monkey (geoffroyi vellerosus). There are 360 species of birds, more than 30 percent of the bird species in the country including green parrots (ara militaris) . Migrating monarch butterflies pause here on their southern route, and butterfly species in general total more than all that are in the U.S. and Canada combined. Many of these species are endangered, and many have not yet been studied. The biosphere reserve in Quer√©taro is managed by Comisi√≥n Nacional de √Åreas Naturales Protegidas of Semarnat . The management system is a combination of federal authorities working with the participation of local communities. The land is generally not owned by the government. Thirty percent of the reserve is communally owned land with the rest privately owned, with the government issuing regulations. Cooperation between federal authorities and local communities has not always gone smoothly, with local residents complaining that the government has issues decrees without consulting them. The CESG and the biosphere project have attracted international support from sponsors such as the Schwab Foundation, Shell, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Grupo Bimbo and nongovernmental organizations such as Ashoka, conservation foundations and U.N. agencies. The Grupo Ecol√≥gico Sierra Gorda was one of 94 winners of the Energy Globe competition among 700 entrants. It received 10,000 Euros to help fund its projects. Conservation of the area has also attracted the attention of people such as director James Cameron, who sponsored a reforestation project on 120 hectares. This is in addition to various other reforestation projects that have been ongoing since the 1990s. These projects even include an overall forest management plan designed to produce enough wood for local woodcutters to earn a living. =Biosphere reserve in Guanajuato= Much of the Sierra Gorda region which extends into the state of Guanajuato was declared a biosphere reserve in 2007 to preserve its biodiversity as well. In this state, protected area covers 236,882 hectares which is the entire municipality of Xich√∫, 70% of Victoria, 65% of Atarjea, about a quarter of San Luis de la Paz and a small portion of Santa Catarina.Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 65 The reserve here is divided into a nucleus, which is in the municipalities of Victoria, Ajarjea and Xich√∫, and a periphery. Only eco tourism, research activities, traditional economic activities and low impact development is allowed in the nucleus. This section of the Sierra Gorda is home to eighty four species of plants from trees to cacti, 182 species of birds and 42 species of mammals. The rugged terrain means that there are a wide number and variety of microclimates although average temperatures vary only between 16 and 19 ¬∞C. It lowest point is a canyon called Paso de Hormigas in Xich√∫ at 650 meters above sea level with a very warm climate suitable for tropical fruit. The highest point is Pinal de Zamorano at 3,300 meters, followed by El Picacho de Pueblo Nuevo, El Zorillo and El Cuervo all above 2,700 meters. The largest changes are seen in arid versus wetter zones, which can often be relatively nearby, with foliage changing from rainforest to pine forest to desert landscapes.Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 64‚Äì65 The area is the poorest in Guanajuato, with over 200 communities which have a population of less than 150. This area is the most rugged in the state where most of the natural areas and small villages are remain intact due to their inaccessibility.Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 51 Culturally, the Sierra Gorda region is the far western part of La Huasteca, which extends over parts of the states of Quer√©taro, San Luis Potos√≠, Hidalgo and Veracruz. =Conservation challenges= The most important conservation problem is that the area is the second most populated natural protected area in Mexico, with severe problems with poverty. This creates a need to balance conservation efforts with local subsistence needs. One important aspect of this is to manage forest resources so that local woodcutters can make a living while controlling how much is cut. However, mass migration out of the region has almost halved the population of the Quer√©taro biosphere to about 50,000 people since it was declared. This has taken pressure off of local natural resources, as agriculture, livestock production and logging lessen. Many of the people who have left are in the United States and send money back home. This money has spurred the building of larger homes and the proliferation of pick up trucks, many with U.S. license plates. It has also allowed for the change to gas over firewood for cooking, but garbage has become a problem. However, overall the depopulation has been positive for the recuperation of the biosphere. Despite the lessened pressure, economic activities still take a toll on the area. Illegal logging is still a very serious problem, as the area has attracted loggers from outside. The problem is most serious in Landa de Matamoros, Pinal de Amoles and Jalpan de Serra . Aside from commercial loggers, areas are also cleared by local farmers looking for more space for animals and crops. This has led to springs and river drying up and eroding of topsoil. While strict environmental protection laws exist, enforcement is lacking. Local authorities have requested the creation of environmental police to guard the forest areas. However, much of the enforcement is done by the local community itself. Lastly, there have been problems with droughts and pest infestations. These include the roundheaded pine beetle, European mistletoe and caterpillars. Some residents see the event as divine will but others place global warming. It is not known how much of the oaks, junipers and pines that make up most of the forested areas have been compromised but there are visible yellow patches seen in the otherwise green forest. The pests have been able to infest more because trees are weak due to drought conditions. Efforts to help the local community preserve the area and make a living primarily consist of payouts to landowners who conserve and eco- tourism. Recently, the federal government along with the United Nations, began a program to pay private land owners for \\"environmental services\\" of between 18 and 27 US dollars for each hectare they conserve each year. However, this only covers about 215 landowners and 21.500 hectares, 5.6% of the total reserve. The second is the promotion of tourism based on the area's natural resources. One organization dedicated to this is Sierra Gorda Ecotours. =Sierra Gorda de Hidalgo= The Sierra Gorda in Hidalgo has not been declared a biosphere reserve, but it still contains a large number of important ecosystems. It is mountainous with a wide variety of ecosystems like other parts of the Sierra Gorda, but this area has a greater percentage of the volcanic rock when entered the area late in its geological history. The terrain is very rocky and difficult to travel. The most important elevation in the Hidalgo area is the Cerro Cangandh√≥ which has an altitude of 2,820 masl, located in the Sierra Alta de Hidalgo, The area is marked by the Moctezuma and Tula Rivers. The first contains a canyon which is 480 meters deep. The border between Hidalgo and Quer√©taro is marked by where the Moctezuma and Tula Rivers meet. This area is also home to one of the largest hydroelectric dams in Mexico. The Sierra Gorda of Hidalgo roughly divides into an arid south and a north filled with forests. In both areas, days are significantly warmer than the nights. The north contains forests of pine, ocote, oaks, junipers and other trees. The south is more arid and much of it is scrub brush. This part of the Sierra Gorda, especially the south, is dominated by the Otomis, rather than the Huasteca or Chichimeca. The most important city is Zimap√°n. Agriculture is limited to corn grown during the rainy season but yields are poor due to the lack of flat lands and fertile soil. Agriculture also increases erosion. More important to the economy is mining, with minerals such as lead, zinc, magnesium, silver and stone such as marble and opals.(higalgogob) Demographics Participants in the annual Huapango dance competition in Pinal de Amoles While indigenous people make up a very small percentage of the population of the region, the Huasteca culture has had a strong impact since the pre Hispanic period. Most of the region is considered to be at least nominally the far western part of this cultural region. Huapango is the dominant native musical and dance style in the Sierra Gorda, with festivals dedicated to it in Xich√∫, Pinal de Amoles, San Joaqu√≠n, where Huasteca influence is strongest. Most of the population lives in very small rural communities, many under 500 inhabitants. There are no notable social conflicts in this area, which is free of problems related to the illegal drug trade that afflict other parts of the country. Most still make a living from agriculture, livestock and mining and in some areas, these traditional economies are protected by law. However, the extreme poverty of the area has forced many, especially younger residents, to migrate to seek employment. This has led to many areas becoming dependent on remittances sent back home, much of it from the United States. In some areas, one in four households is supported by remittance money. Major communities View of Fraile Plaza in Jalpan de Serra Jalpan de Serra is in the north of Quer√©taro. It is called the \\"heart of the Sierra Gorda\\" in part due to is geographic location in the city and the fact that it is the only city in the biosphere. Jalpan is closely surrounded by mountains, with cobblestone streets around the very center. Mornings frequently are foggy or cloudy, with the sun burn such off by midday. Ecotourism and tourism related to the five Franciscan friary declared a World Heritage Site have recently become an important part of the economy. The Jalpan Dam has become important as a habitat for aquatic birds. Xich√∫, in the state of Guanajuato, was founded in 1585 as a mining town, with the municipality containing a high elevation at Cerro El Descarado, at 2,400masl and a low elevation where the Santa Mar√≠a River and the Xoconoxtle meet at 826 masl, the lowest in the state. It has a population of over 11,000 people and although very few are indigenous, Huasteca influence is notable. Zimap√°n is the largest city in the Hidalgo portion of the Sierra Gorda. Unlike other parts of the Sierra Gorda, this area has been dominated by the Otomi, with the Spanish city founded in 1522. It is primarily a mining center, extracting various metals and stones from the steep mountains that surround it. The municipality has a fairly significant number of indigenous language speakers; over 3,000 in a total population of about 34,000. History Human settlements in the area have been dated to between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, in the southern part of the region, with the earliest found in the far south of the area in what is now the municipality of Cadereyta de Montes, in an area called the Mesa de Le√≥n. The earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers; however over time, many developed sedentary agricultural villages by the end of the Pre Classic period . The development of these villages was bolstered by migration of agricultural peoples from the Mexican Plateau and the Gulf of Mexico coast, especially from the latter. Agriculture was concentrated in the lower valley areas, the few plains and some sides of mountains. This also included the cutting of forests to make more agricultural land. Most settlements are found near springs, ponds and small lakes as they were the most readily usable sources of water, instead of the rivers which ran deep inside narrow canyons. This included the Huastecas, who were found mostly in the far northeast of the region, noted for growing cotton. The height of settlement of the area came between the 6th and 10th centuries, with the largest number of successful human settlements, with an economy based on farming and mining. During this time, the area saw intense commercial traffic and cultural exchanges between Gulf of Mexico, the Huasteca area and the Mexican Plateau, with artifacts related to R√≠o Verde in San Luis Potos√≠, Teotihuacan, Tula, west to the Baj√≠o and from the valleys of Quer√©taro and San Juan del R√≠o all found. However, the peoples of the Sierra Gorda had more ties with peoples to the west, north and east, than with the Mexican Plateau to the south. This is when the cities of Las Ranas and Toluquilla grew. The two cities‚Äô economies were based on the control of trade routes and mining of cinnabar, used as a red pigment. The mining of cinnabar required coordinated and hierarchical labor practices for the various tasks involved, which would lead to the development of these cities. This area was the primary provider of red pigment to Mesoamerica . Between 200 and 1000 CE, the area was culturally divided into three regions, R√≠o Verde, the Serrana Cultura and the Huasteca. The R√≠o Verde region is located in the northwest of the state of Quer√©taro into San Luis Potos√≠. The Serrana Culture is found around the archeological sites of Las Ranas and Toluquilla, which dominated most of the trade routes, and had the greatest population during the Classic Period (200-900CE). The Huasteca region is in the far northeast with major settlements at Tancoyol, La Campana, Tancama and Tonatico, which had fertile lands. The Otomi arrived in the area in 800 CE and settled peacefully. The development of cities and dominions came to a halt in the 11th century, after being in decline for over 300 years before that. During the Post classic (900‚Äì1521) all of the area's cities in Quer√©taro would become abandoned. There are two theories as to why this occurred. The first is that there was climate change during this time, which caused the area to dry out. The second was that it was due to social phenomena, as a number of cities in Mesoamerica, including Teotihuacan went into decline. Eventually the cities of the Sierra Gorda were abandoned altogether, but this may have been gradual. Evidence at Las Ranas and Toluquilla indicate a non violent transition, as farming communities were abandoned and replaced by hunter-gatherer communities. The hunter gatherer cultures that moved in from the 11th century remained until the colonial period, and were categorized together as \\"Chichimecas\\". These consisted in various ethnicities including Pames, Ximpeces Guachichils and Jonaz. All speak languages in the Oto-Manguean family, with differences mostly cultural. The Pames were found mostly in the east with the Jonaz in the west. In addition, there were also groups of Otomis and Huasteca to be found. The areas in the far east and far west of the Sierra Gorda were dominated by the Spanish soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. What is now the Sierra Gorda in Guanajuato and Hidalgo states had Spanish cities in them by the middle of the 16th century. The main reason for this was that these areas had higher concentrations of mineral deposits. Another factor was that the indigenous peoples in these areas were relatively compliant to Spanish rule, especially in Hidalgo, where the Otomi had already been dominated by Xilotepec . The Spanish entered the heart of the Sierra Gorda early, with Nu√±o de Guzm√°n conquering the Oxitipa dominion, which encompassed Jalpan, Xilitla, Tancoyol and Tilaco in 1527. However, during the early colonial period, the Quer√©taro Sierra Gorda would remain dangerous territory as the Chichimecas fought Spanish domination. with the first war between the Chichimeca Jonaz and the Spanish occurring in 1554. During the 16th and 17th century, the Spanish would surround this area on west, east and south, with military and missionary incursions into the interior. Spanish settlements were begun to the south of it, such as the Villa de Cadereyta in order to form a bulwark against the nomadic Chichimeca tribes. In the late 16th century, a number of forts were established in the area including El Jofre and Jalpan. The incursions were provoked not because of significant mineral deposits in northern Quer√©taro, but rather, the area laid on roads which led into mining areas such as Guanajuato and Zacatecas . Missionary work began in 1550 with an Augustinian mission in Xilitla, San Luis Potos√≠. However, like military incursions, evangelism would occur from outside the heart of the region and gradually move inwards with many failures. However, the challenge to the Spanish was not only the hostility of the native peoples, but also this area lacked cities or towns, or the social hierarchy that was taken advantage of in other areas of Mesoamerica. In this region, the Spanish would have to create population centers. Systematic evangelization of the Quer√©taro area would not be attempted until the 17th century, when Augustinians in the east and Franciscans in the west began building missions in 1670 and 1680s, under the military protection of Captain Jer√≥nimo de Labra. However, Labra died in 1683, and the missions were unprotected. The Dominicans would arrive soon after but by 1700, both they and the Augustinians and Dominicans abandoned missions in most of the area, leaving only the Franciscans in Tolim√°n, Cadereyta, Escanela and Macon√≠. Many of the missions built in the interior during the 16th and 17th centuries were destroyed shortly after they were built. Successful missions were established in the far south of the region, with the mission of San Francisco Tolim√°n in 1683,the mission of San Jos√© de Vizarr√≥n in the 1740s. Because of this, much of the first evangelization efforts undertaken before the mid 18th century have been largely forgotten. In 1740, the colonial government in Mexico City decided to extinguish indigenous resistance the Sierra Gorda, and send an expedition headed by Jos√© de Escand√≥n to accomplish this. Escand√≥n mostly fought the Chichimeca Jonaz, culminating in the Battle of Media Luna in 1749, when the Chichimeca were decisively defeated. Legend states that at the end of the battle, the Chichimecas and Ximpeces climbed the hill the battle was fought on to commit collective suicide rather than to be integrated into the Spanish order. In the far north of Quer√©taro, the Pames were more pacifistic and accepting of Spanish domination. It was these people who the Franciscans were able to group into larger settlements around missions. Although the mission in Jalpan was established before Jun√≠pero Serra's 1750 arrival into the region, Serra is given credit for building the five main missions of this area and completing the evangelization of the local people. In reality, the missions were built by Pame hands, under the direction of various Franciscan friars including Jos√© Antonio de Murgu√≠a in Conc√°, Juan Crispi in Tilaco, Juan Ramos de Lora in Tancoyol and Miguel de la Campa in Landa. However, the vision for the building of the missions was Serra's, as he imagined a type of utopia based on Franciscan principles. Serra insisted that the missionaries learn the local languages and experience hunger along with the rest of the population. There was still hostility to the Spanish presence, and Serra's response was economic as well as spiritual. The portals of the five main mission churches reflect this vision as well. The style of the five missions is called \\"Mestizo Baroque\\" as the indigenous elements are more clearly visible here than in other Baroque structures further south. The Baroque is mostly confined to the portals of the main facades and are meant to function much as an altarpiece, and to teach a world view to the natives of the area. Serra spent eleven years in the Sierra Gorda before moving on in the late 1760s. The missions established in Quer√©taro would be the first of a long series of missions that would be established as the Spanish made their way north into what is now southern California. Various uprisings occurred in the area in 1810 as part of the Mexican War of Independence. The town of Jalpan was burned and sacked by royalist forces in 1819. In the 19th century, the area was still heavily dominated by indigenous people, with small settlements of mestizos and criollos. Conflicts between the indigenous groups and others began at this time over natural resources such as land, water and especially forests. The Sierra Gorda Rebellion began in 1847 by deserters from the Mexican army. The uprising spread to nearly all parts of the Sierra Gorda region from Guanajuato to San Luis Potos√≠ to Veracruz, with the most activity in Santa Mar√≠a del R√≠o, Xich√∫ and Rioverde between 1847 and 1849. The rebels demanded free use of various lands, the abolition of levies, the division of haciendas and the termination of parish church rights to land. Initial efforts by authorities to subdue the uprising were only partially successful. Rebels had control of various cities such as Ciudad Fern√°ndez, Rioverde and Santa Mar√≠a del R√≠o by 1849. However, the government caught the most important rebel leader by the name of Quiroz that same year and executed him. This broke the main resistance and the government was able to put much of the rebellion down by 1850. From Jalpan, General Tom√°s Mej√≠a led military actions here against the Liberal government installed in the state of Quer√©taro and the country. He managed to take the main square of Quer√©taro in 1857. However, at the end of the Reform War, he was executed along with Maximilian I of Mexico . In 1880, the first major (dirt) road was built through the area to connect it with the capital. This spurred economic development in the region. Jalpan gained city status in 1904 as it already has electricity, telephone, telegraph and a sugar cane mill.(arqueomex) In 1911, the Grupo Revolucionario Aquiles Serd√°n was created in Jalpan under Policarpo Olvera and fought with the forces under Francisco I. Madero . The modern Quer√©taro-Jalpan highway was built between 1962 and 1970, along with a number of other roads, bridges, electrification and water services. The economy of the region had remained mostly the same since the colonial period, mostly based on agriculture and livestock.In 1989, this began to change as local residents formed the non governmental organization Grupo Ecol√≥gico Sierra Gorda. The group works with environmental education, reforestation and waste management among other things. The group worked to get the biosphere declared in 1997 and has had international support since then. This has spurred ecotourism. The mission churches of the area suffered damage from the Mexican War of Independence and the Mexican Revolution, and had been all but completely abandoned by the second half of the 20th century. In the 1980s, the churches were \\"discovered\\" by a group from INAH from Xilitla. The churches were restored in the 1980s and 1990s, and declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. Cinnabar and mercury mining has been part of the southern Sierra Gorda since the Pre classic period. This mining remained important until the 1970s, when most of the commercial mines closing and the last, in Macon√≠, closed in 2000. However, there are still at least six families known to mine the element on a very small scale. According to researchers, the long history of mercury mining here has caused the contamination of the environment as it built up over time. They believe this is behind the high levels of certain chronic diseases in the region. There are plans to build a dam on the Ext√≥raz River, 85 meters tall to store 118 million m3 of water. The water would be transported by aqueduct 138 km to the city of Quer√©taro. However, there is local opposition to the project. Missions The missions of Sierra Gorda View of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Luz Mission in Tancoyol During the 16th and 17th century, there were attempts to evangelize the Sierra Gorda of Quer√©taro by the Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans. However, almost all of these missions were never completed or were destroyed soon after they were built by the indigenous communities. The military pacification of the area by Jos√© de Escand√≥n in the 1740s allowed for the building of permanent missions in the heart of the Sierra Gorda. However, the five Franciscans missions accredited to Jun√≠pero Serra were built in Pame territory, as these people were more accepting of Spanish domination. The placement of the missions had the purpose of dividing the heart of the Sierra Gorda and to open roads into San Luis Potos√≠ . The missions were built by Pame hands, under the direction of various Franciscan friars including Jos√© Antonio de Murgu√≠a in Conc√°, Juan Crispi in Tilaco, Juan Ramos de Lora in Tancoyol and Miguel de la Campa in Landa. However, the vision for the building of the missions was Serra's, as he imagined a type of utopia based on Franciscan principles. Serra insisted that the missionaries learn the local languages and experience hunger along with the rest of the population. There was still hostility to the Spanish presence, and Serra's response was economic as well as spiritual. The main feature of these churches is the ornate decoration of the main portals, although there is decoration on the bell towers and in some churches, other areas as well. This decoration is termed \\"Mestizo Baroque\\" or \\"Mestizo architecture\\" according to INAH. The ornate decoration is primarily aimed at teaching the new religion to the indigenous peoples, but unlike even the Baroque works further south, indigenous influence is obvious as the Serra's idea was to demonstrate a blending of cultures rather than complete conquest. One element is the use of red, orange, and yellow, including pastel shades, and native sacred figures such as the rabbit and jaguar appear. The mission churches have a single nave, covered by a cannon vault, but each has its own peculiarities, especially in the portals. Serra spent eleven years in the Sierra Gorda before moving on in the late 1760s north. San Francisco Mission in Tilaco The mission in Jalpan was established before the arrival of Jun√≠pero Serra in 1744, but Serra was in charge of building the mission complex that stands today from 1751 to 1758. It is dedicated to the Apostle James, the first evangelist. This complex is situated in the center of the modern town in front of the main plaza and formed by an atrium, cloister, pilgrim portal and church, with a chapel annex on the left side. The original atrium wall was lost, but reconstructed in the same style, with three portals and inverted arches. The main features of the ornate portal on the facade are Our Lady of the Pillar and the Virgin of Guadalupe, both with Mesoamerican connections, as well as a double headed eagle, meant to symbolize the blending of the two cultures. A second mission is located in the community of Tancoyol called Nuestra Se√±ora de la Luz de Tancoyol, dedicated to Our Lady of Light. This facade has profuse vegetative ornamentation, with ears of corn prominent and is the most elaborate of the five missions. It is likely that this mission was constructed by Juan Ramos de Lora, who resided here from 1761 to 1767. The structure is similar to those in Jalpan and Landa. It has a church with a Latin cross layout and choir area, a sacristy, atrium with cross and chapels in the corners of the atrium called \\"capillas posas\\". There is also a pilgrims' gate, a cloister and quarters for the priest. The interior has a number of sculptures including one of \\"Our Lady of Light\\". The facade consists of three bodies, a pediment and four est√≠pite columns. The lower body has sculptures of Saints Peter and Paul and who Franciscan coats of arms. The second body has sculptures of Joachem and Saint Anne, with the Virgin Mary in her arms, and a niche in the center. There are also images from the Passion such as nails and a lance. This niche contained an image of Our Lady of Light, but it is empty now. Between the second and third bodies, there is a large window and above it, a representation of the stigmata of Francis of Assisi. The pediment contains a large cross in relief of two styles related to the Franciscan and Dominican orders. The bell tower is narrow and the baptistery is at the base of this tower. On the lower part appears a small window which illuminates the baptistery. The cupola of the tower is in a pyramid shape with a Baroque iron cross on top. Indigenous influence is noted in the interior columns of the church, which have images of a jaguar and a person with Olmec features. Mission of San Miguel Conc√° San Miguel Conc√° is located forty km from Jalpan on Highway 69 to R√≠o Verde. The church is in the center of the community on one side of Guerrero Street. It is oriented to the south and dedicated to the Archangel Michael. It is the smallest of the mission churches and was probably finished in 1754, according to an inscription located inside the church. Conc√° is a Pame word which means \\"with me\\". The decoration is mestizo as well with large flowers, foliage and coarse figures in indigenous style. It is distinguished by an image of the Holy Trinity at the crest along with a rabbit and double-headed eagle. San Francisco del Valle de Tilaco is a small community eighteen km northeast of Landa de Matamoros. It was constructed between 1754 and 1762 by Juan Crespi and dedicated to Francis of Assisi. It has some characteristics different from the other missions. First, it is built on a gradient. The bell tower is separated from the main nave of the church by the baptistery and structurally functions as a buttress for the church. Tilaco is the best conserved of the five missions and has the most subtle ornamentation on its facade. Its facades are composed of three horizontal and three vertical partitions, with the Franciscan coat of arms prominent over the main entrance. In Tilaco, the facade has small angels, ears of corn and a strange large jar over which is an image of Francis of Assisi. One distinctive decorative element is four mermaids with indigenous features. Tilaco has the best conserved atrium corner chapels called \\"capillas posas\\", which were used for processions. Santa Mar√≠a del Agua de Landa is located twenty km from Jalpan on Highway 120 towards Xilitla. The mission was built between 1760 and 1768 by Miguel de la Campa is dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, which gives rise to part of the community's name. It was the last of the missions to be built. The atrium is bordered by a wall and centered by a cross, and paved in stone. It is noted for its equilibrium in composition and very narrow bell tower, which is integrated into the facade. The sculpture of this facade is considered to be the best of the five according to Arqueolog√≠a Mexicana magazine. The faces of the mermaids at Landa have indigenous features. Jun√≠pero Serra spent eight years on the project of building the missions until 1770. When a number of historical events, including the expulsion of the Jesuits, forced the abandonment of the missions. Serra moved on to California. When Serra left, the missions were left in the hands of regular clergy. During both the Mexican War of Independence and the Mexican Revolution, the missions suffered sacking and destruction. Initial restoration work to the outside of the mission churches was begun in the 1980s. Between 1991 and 1997, interior work on altars, choirs, organs and paintings was done. Further work was sponsored by the state between 1997 and 2002. Work done in the 1990s also included that on surrounding plazas and monuments. The effort to inscribe the missions as a World Heritage Site began in 2000 and was ultimately successful in 2003, when it was added during the 27th meeting of the World Heritage Committee. Archeological sites Las Ranas At the end of the Preclassic, most of the Sierra Gorda was populated by agricultural villages established by people who migrated here from the Mexican Plateau and Gulf of Mexico coast, mostly from the latter. Agriculture was concentrated in the lower valley areas, the few plains and some sides of mountains. This also included the cutting of forests to make more agricultural land. Most settlements are found near springs, ponds and small lakes as they were the most readily usable sources of water, instead of the rivers which ran deep inside narrow canyons. Settlements were ranked in importance according to their function, with Las Ranas and Toluquillo occupying the most important positions. The height of settlement of the area came between the 6th and 10th centuries, with the largest number of successful human settlements, with an economy based on farming and mining. The pre Hispanic architecture of the area is best developed in the major urban centers. These cities are centered on a Mesoamerican ball court which then opens up to various plazas and monumental structures on pyramid bases. Other structures such as administrative buildings and residences are found in both squared and round forms, but most often with a talud topped by a cornice. As many cities were situated on top of hills, the leveling of terraces to create space is another distinctive feature. However, while stucco was used on some floors, there is no evidence of walls being covered in it, as seen further south. The mining of cinnabar required coordinated and hierarchical labor practices for the various tasks involved, which would lead to the development of the cities of Las Ranas and Toluquilla. This area was the primary provider of this red pigment to Mesoamerica. The pottery of the area was influenced by the mineral deposits of the area for coloring and Olmec based influences coming from the east of the area. One strong example of both is the production of what is called \\"black Olmec pottery\\". There is little known about the religious beliefs of this area, as few symbols have been found to identify deities or religious calendar. Burials do indicate a belief in life after death, as interred individuals, sometimes sacrificed, are found in a fetal position. Grave goods include many objects used in life as well as containers which may have contained food. Aracheology in the Sierra Gorda began just before the second half of the 19th century, when mine engineers reported archeological finds in the mountains. Several of these engineers organized expeditions, some with state support, which resulted in the mapping of sites such as Las Ranas and Toluquillo. These expeditions also include the first photographs of these sites. The discovery of these two cities generated academic interest, but they were not further explored until 1931, when archeologist Eduardo Noguera and architect Emilio Cuevas went to evaluate the sites for the Direction of Pre Hispanic Monuments. By 1939, twenty seven sites had been identified in Quer√©taro, with twenty three in the Sierra Gorda. There are over 400 archeological sites, with twenty six primary ones, Ahuacatl√°n, Arroyo Seco, Arquitos, Canoas, Cerro de la Campana, Cerro del Sapo, Conc√°, Decon√≠, Ecatitl√°n, El Doctor, La Colonia, La Plazuela, Lobo, Los Moctezumas, Pueblo Viejo, Pur√≠sima, Ranas, Sabino, San Juan, Soyatal, Tancama, Tancoyol, Tilaco, Toluquilla, Tonatico and Vigas. From an anthropological perspective, Quer√©taro, especially the northeast, is of great interest because of the cultures which developed and disappeared here as well as its connections with Mesoamerica and cultures to the north, but knowledge of the region is limited. It is possible that the peoples of the area had cultural and economic contacts as far north as Casas Grandes,and what is now New Mexico and Arizona. The mummy of a girl was found in a cave near the community of Altamira in the municipality of Cadereyta de Montes which shows evidence of agricultural settlement in an area that today does not support it. The semi desert conditions that currently prevail in most of the Sierra Gorda dates from climate change that occurred at the end of the first millennia CE, which dried the area and probably put an end to city and dominion development. Las Ranas and Toluquilla were the two largest prehispanic cities to develop in the Sierra Gorda area. Las Ranas was the most developed city from the 7th to the 11th century, with Toluquilla somewhat smaller and reaching its height in the 11th century. Both cities are near to each other and both controlled the active trade routes of the area as well as the mining of cinnabar, highly prized as a red pigment in Mesoamerica. The trade that passed through the area linked the Gulf of Mexico to the central Mexican Plateau and some areas north as well. Extensive mining was done at both Toluquilla and Las Ranas beginning between 200 and 300 CE, extracting cinnabar, mercury and sulfur. Cinnabar was the most prized used in funerals. The structures at the sites indicate a stratified society and built with stone slabs and mud and covered in stucco in some places. At Toluquilla, many structures were built on terraces cut into the mountain to create more space. Las Ranas was taken over by the Chichimeca Jonaz late in its history but by the time the Spanish arrived, both cities were abandoned. In 2009, INAH and other institutions carried out research at Toluquilla on thirty skeletons from the pre Hispanic era in order to determine the importance of mining in the south of the Sierra Gorda. The objective of the study was to determine the amount of accumulation of mercury in the bones to find out who was most involved in the mining and how it affected the health of the population. It also studies patterns of mercury contamination in the surrounding environment as well. There have been over eighty extraction sites for cinnabar found around Las Ranas and Toluquilla, which lie on one of the largest deposits of the mineral in Mexico. The archaeological study of mining by the Sierra Gorda Project was begun in the 1970s, based on an earlier interdisciplinary study carried out at the Sierra de Quer√©taro. The project was supported by the federal and state governments as well as UNAM. The project further mapped the cities of Las Ranas and Toluqillo. Further studies in the 1980s consolidated earlier findings and worked out settlement patterns in the wider area. Continued work at that time classified the ancient cultures and register more than 500 sites, encompassing all of northern Quer√©taro and into San Luis Potos√≠. The effect of mercury poisoning is not only an ancient problem but a modern one as well. These studies are also investigating the high levels of certain chronic diseases in the current population.

It was built for the 1915 Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition. The bridge was nominated for the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Location A modern view of the Cabrillo Bridge The Cabrillo Bridge is one of several access routes to the cluster of museums located at the historic \\"El Prado Complex\\" (the former 1915 Panama Exposition site), which is east of the bridge in the middle of Balboa Park and continuing to a point near the Bea Evenson Fountain (and former trolley stop) just west of Park Boulevard. The east-west street atop the two-lane bridge is called \\"El Prado\\". Many people mistakenly refer to the street as Laurel Street, which is a continuation of El Prado but ends at Sixth Avenue, and some refer to the bridge as the Laurel Street Bridge. Sixth Avenue forms the western boundary of Balboa Park. Laurel Street continues west from Sixth Avenue to form the southern border of San Diego's International Airport, Lindbergh Field, and ends at Harbor Drive on San Diego Bay. The structure is easily seen from the scenic Cabrillo Freeway (State Route 163), which is located on the floor of the canyon below. Construction of the freeway through the canyon below the bridge was completed in February 1948.Showley (2000), p. 135 However, traffic on the bridge is not visible from the freeway due to the unusual height of the bridge. The height is dictated entirely by the topography of the canyon. El Prado crosses the bridge at the same level as the ground on either end of the bridge, while State Route 163 passes beneath it at approximately the level of the original canyon floor. There is no direct access route between State Route 163 and Laurel Street or El Prado. History =Construction= The bridge was built for the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition of 1915. It provided the main access across Cabrillo Canyon (formerly known as Pound Canyon, which was used to hold cattle and horses in the late 19th century). An initial design for the bridge was developed by Bertram Goodhue that featured three large arches.Amero (2013), p. 38 The design was to be similar to Toledo, Spain's Alc√°ntara Bridge. However, Frank P. Allen, Jr. convinced Balboa Park commissioners to choose a cheaper design by Thomas B. Hunter of San Francisco that looked similar to other bridges in Mexico and Spain. The innovative design featured a multiple-arched cantilever structure, the first such bridge in California.Showley (2000), p. 93 Building began in December 1912 under the supervision of Allen.Christman (1985), p. 55 The concrete forms were made of of wood, mostly redwood. The length of the bridge is including approaches. The main span is long and high. The seven arches are each across and are supported by fourteen hollow concrete pillars. The bridge's construction cost reached $250,000 ($ today).Showley (2000), p. 94 =1915 and 1935 Expositions= The bridge was primarily intended as a pedestrian pathway to the 1915 Exposition. It was dedicated April 12, 1914 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Roosevelt made the inaugural automobile crossing along with the mayor of the city, Charles F. O'Neill.Pourade (1965), p. 179 For the next two years, auto traffic was reserved mostly for dignitaries. Roosevelt returned in 1935, this time as President of the United States, to cross the bridge again for Balboa Park's second exposition. =Renovations= Low aerial view of Cabrillo Bridge and San Diego Museum of Man In 2014, the bridge was closed to pedestrian and vehicle traffic to repave the road, fix sidewalks, add lights, and improve its stability during earthquakes. In June, after six months of work the planned deck renovations were completed and the bridge was re-opened for traffic. Seismic, lighting, cosmetic, and access renovations were completed in spring of 2015 with a total construction cost of approximately $23.3 million. Over 250 tradespeople worked on the project. The project received the San Diego AGC award for excellence in project management and construction for heavy/highway construction in 2015. Issues =Fires= In July 1951, a small fire ignited in the easternmost span of the bridge.Christman (2000), p. 56 Redwood timbers, used as concrete forms in the original construction, smoldered for several hours. Once put out, the blaze was quickly forgotten. But as Balboa Park historian Richard Amero noted, the fire was an \\"omen,\\" and \\"nothing was done to reduce the likelihood of future fires.\\" The \\"future\\" fire erupted before dawn on June 17, 2004. Once again, aged wooden concrete forms ignited, possibly the result of arson, inside the bridge columns. The fire was difficult to reach and extinguish. Firefighters saved the structure by sawing holes in the bridge's sidewalks with jackhammers and saws to pump in foam and water. If one walks across the bridge, it is easy to sight those now repaired holes which the firefighters cut that day. The near-disaster spurred a major rehabilitation of the Cabrillo Bridge. A one- year Caltrans project repaired broken concrete, replaced corroded steel, and finally removed most of the old wood from the original construction. In November 2013, yet another fire burned inside the hollow bridge, again while a Caltrans funded project was being undertaken. =Suicides= By October 1931, 17 people had \\"made the leap into eternity\\" from the bridge, said Mayor Walter Austin. One city official, after talk of installing suicide preventative measures failed, mentioned that \\"after a council meeting there are times a councilman might want to make use of a bridge.\\" In 1934, a despondent sailor jumped from the bridge and splashed into the man made lagoon (Laguna de Puente) that at that time lay below. He survived, bruised but living. It was said that when the ambulance arrived, he sat at the edge of the lagoon and complained of a headache. After eight people jumped during the first six months of 1950 (and at least 50 total since its construction), city workers installed wrought iron fencing on both parapets of the bridge in June 1950. However, the suicides from the bridge did not really stop until the Coronado bridge was built.

Transactions of the Royal Historical Society: Sixth Series Cambridge University Press p24) was a notable Viking chieftain of the late 9th century who made several raiding voyages.  Early life  Little is known of Hastein's early life. He is described as a Dane in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He is said to have participated in raids on the island of Noirmoutier during 834‚Äì835. Hastein is credited with being involved with various raids on the Frankish Empire but is probably most famous for jointly leading a great raid into the Mediterranean in 859. > For indeed the Frankish nation, which was crushed by the avenger Anstign > [Hastein], was very full of filthy uncleanness. Treasonous and oath- > breaking, they were deservedly condemned; unbelievers and faithless, they > were justly punished ... Dudo of St. Quentin's. Gesta Normannorum. Book 1. > Chapter 3.  Spain and the Mediterranean  During 859‚Äì862, Hastein jointly led an expedition with Bj√∂rn Ironside. A fleet of 62 ships sailed from the Loire to raid countries in the Mediterranean.Haywood, John (1995). The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Viking Penguin Books p 58‚Äì59 At first the raiding did not go well, with Hastein being defeated by the Asturians and later the Muslims of the Umayyad Caliphate of C√≥rdoba at Niebla in 859. Success followed with the sacking of Algeciras, where the mosque was burned, and then the ravaging of Mazimma in the Idrisid Caliphate on the north coast of Africa, followed by further raids into the Umayyad Caliphate at Orihuela, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon. They occupied Nekor for 8 days. Hastein and Bj√∂rn wintered at Camargue island on the mouth of the Rhone before ravaging Narbonne, N√Æmes and Arles, then as far north as Valence, before moving onto Italy. There they attacked the city of Luna. Believing it to be Rome, Hastein had his men carry him to the gate and tell the guards he was dying and wished to convert to Christianity. Once inside, he was taken to the town's church where he received the sacraments, before jumping from his stretcher and leading his men in a sack of the town. Another account has him claiming to want to convert before he died, and then feigning death on the following day. Luna then allowed his body and 50 of his men clad in robes enter for his burial. Hastein's men had concealed swords under their robes, and once inside Hastein leaped from his coffin, decapitated the priest and sacked the city. However, the veracity of this is much debated. He sailed down the coast and sacked Pisa and, sailing on the River Arno, ravaged Fiesole. The fleet then possibly raided the Byzantine Empire's territories in the eastern Mediterranean. On the way back to the Loire, he stopped off in North Africa where he bought several African slaves (known to the Vikings as 'bl√°menn', blue men, possibly Soussians or Tuaregs) who he later sold in Ireland. They were presumed to have lost 40 ships in a storm, and lost 2 more at the Straits of Gibraltar on their way home, near Medina-Sidonia, but still managed to ravage Pamplona before returning home to the Loire with 20 ships.  Loire and Seine  Settled back in Brittany, Hastein allied himself with Salomon, King of Brittany against the Franks in 866, and as part of a Viking-Breton army he killed Robert the Strong at the Battle of Brissarthe near Ch√¢teauneuf-sur- Sarthe.Kendrick T.D (1930). A History of the Vikings New York Charles Scribner's Sons In 867 he went on to ravage Bourges and a year later attacked Orl√©ans. Peace lasted until spring 872 when the Viking fleet sailed up the Maine and occupied Angers, which led to a siege by the Frankish king Charles the Bald and a peace being agreed in October 873. Hastein remained in the Loire country until 882, when he was finally expelled by Charles and then relocated his army north to the Seine. There he stayed until the Franks besieged Paris and his territory in the Picardy was threatened. It was at this point he became one of many experienced Vikings to look to England for riches and plunder.  \\"Hastein\\" in England  There may have been a different Viking named Hastein who landed in England in 892. The Hastein of the Noirmoutier raids (834‚Äì835) would have been at least 71 years old by this time, old for any European during the 9th century and especially a Viking. The Hastein who crossed to England from Boulogne in 892 led one of two great companies. His army, the smaller of the two, landed in 80 ships and occupied the royal village of Milton in Kent, whilst his allies landed at Appledore with 250 ships.Stenton, F. M. (1971). Anglo-Saxon England Third Edition Oxford: Oxford University Press Alfred the Great positioned the West Saxon army between them to keep them from uniting, the result of which was that Hastein agreed terms, including allowing his two sons to be baptised, and left Kent for Essex. The larger army attempted to reunite with Hastein after raiding Hampshire and Berkshire in the late spring of 893, but was defeated at Farnham by an army under Prince Edward, Alfred's son. The survivors eventually reached Hastein's army at Mersea Island, after a combined West Saxon and Mercian army failed to dislodge them from their fortress at Thorney.Kendrick T.D (1930). A History of the Vikings New York Charles Scribner's Sons. p. 242 As a result, Hastein combined his forces from Appledore and Milton and withdrew them to a fortified camp at Benfleet, Essex. He used this camp as a base to raid Mercia. However, while his main force was out raiding those left in the fort were defeated by the bolstered militia of eastern Wessex. The West Saxons captured the fort, along with the ships, booty, women and children. This included Hastein's own wife and sons.Walker, Ian W (2000). Mercia and the Making of England Sutton Hastein re-established his combined force at a new fort at Shoebury further north in Essex, and received reinforcements from the settled Danes of East Anglia and York. Shortly after, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Hastein held talks with Alfred, possibly to discuss terms for the release of his family. Whatever the discussion, it seems Hastein had his two sons returned to him. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle tells us that it was because Alfred and Alfred's son-in-law Aethelred of Mercia, had stood sponsor to Hastein's sons at their baptism in early 893, before Hastein had arrived at Benfleet. Thus Alfred was godfather to one boy and Aethelred godfather to the otherAnglo-Saxon Chronicle 893 / Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 894 ‚Äì English translation at project Gutenberg. Retrieved 3 August 2015 If Alfred's strategy was to create peace then it was a failure as shortly after, Hastein launched a second raid along the Thames valley and from there along the River Severn. Hastein was pursued all the way by Aethelred and a combined Mercian and West Saxon army, reinforced by a contingent of warriors from the Welsh kingdoms. Eventually the Viking army was trapped at Buttington, this was possibly the island of Buttington on the Severn near Welshpool, Powys, then at the resulting Battle of Buttington several weeks later they fought their way out, and lost many men, and returned to the fortress at Shoebury. According to the annals: > ..after many weeks had passed, some of the heathen [Vikings] died of hunger, > but some, having by then eaten their horses, broke out of the fortress, and > joined battle with those who were on the east bank of the river.

English translation at Project Gutenberg > Retrieved 13 July 2015 In late summer 893, Hastein's men struck out again. They moved all their booty, women and ships, from East Anglia, to a ruined Roman fortress at Chester. The plan was to rebuild the fortifications and use it as a base for raiding northern Mercia. However, the Mercians had other ideas, they laid siege to the fortress and attempted to starve the Danes out by removing or retrieving any livestock and destroying any crops in the area. In the autumn the besieged army left Chester, marched down to the south of Wales and devastated the Welsh kingdoms of Brycheiniog, Gwent and Glywysing until the summer of 894. They return via Northumbria, the Danish held midlands of the Five Burghs, and East Anglia to return to the fort at Mersea Island. In the autumn of 894, the army towed their ships up the Thames to a new fort on the River Lea. In the summer of 895 Alfred arrived with the West Saxon army, and obstructed the course of the Lea with a fort either side of the river. The Danes abandoned their camp, returned their women to East Anglia and made another great march across the Midlands to a site on the Severn (where Bridgnorth now stands), followed all the way by hostile forces. There they stayed until the spring of 896 when the army finally dispersed into East Anglia, Northumbria and according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, those that were penniless found themselves ships and went south across the sea to the Seine. Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 897- English translation at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 3 August 2015  Legacy  Hastein disappeared from history in around 896, by then an old man having already been described as \\"the lusty and terrifying old warrior of the Loire and the Somme\\", when he arrived in England several years earlier. He was one of the most notorious and successful Vikings of all time, having raided dozens of cities across many kingdoms in Europe and North Africa. The Norman monk Dudo of Saint-Quentin was very critical of Hastein: > This was a man accursed: fierce, mightily cruel, and savage, pestilent, > hostile, sombre, truculent, given to outrage, pestilent and untrustworthy, > fickle and lawless. Death-dealing, uncouth, fertile in ruses, warmonger > general, traitor, fomenter of evil, and double-dyeded dissimulator ... Dudo > of St. Quentin's. Gesta Normannorum. Book 1. Chapter 3. He is identified with the Jarl Hasting who held the Channel Islands for a while. Some scholars have suggested that the Hastings area of Sussex in England may have been founded by a forebear of Hastein.C.T. Chevalier.

In the television adaptation The Last Kingdom he is played by Norwegian actor Jeppe Beck Laursen. Jarl Hastein also appears in the fictional series The Strongbow Saga written by Judson Roberts.

Playing career  = Club career = Born in Copenhagen, Christensen started his career with Br√∏nsh√∏j BK in 1985, under manager Ebbe Skovdahl. He moved abroad in the same year, 17 years old, to play for Swiss club Servette FC. With Servette, he won the 1985 Swiss Super League. He wanted away from the club, and was initially loaned out to Danish club Vejle Boldklub in 1987. He moved permanently to Br√∏ndby IF, under Br√∏ndby manager Ebbe Skovdahl, later that year. He was a part of the Br√∏ndby team that won the 1988 and 1989 Danish championships. In his time for Br√∏ndby, he was Danish league top goalscorer three times, in the 1988 season, 1990 season and 1991 season tournaments. He was part of the Br√∏ndby team who, under manager Morten Olsen, reached the semi-finals of the European 1991 UEFA Cup tournament, and he was sold to German team FC Schalke 04 later that year. The transfer deal was a race for Christensen's signature between Schalke and Eintracht Frankfurt, and was worth DEM 5 million, which made Christensen the most expensive Danish footballer at the time, with a monthly wage of DKK 400,000. He did not find playing success at Schalke, where he scored eight goals in 49 games, and he earned the nickname \\"Trabi-Bent\\". He moved to Greek club Olympiacos for the 1993 season, where he found playing success. In July 1994, he moved on to SD Compostela in Spain.

It was recorded at the Planet Roc recording studio in Berlin and produced by Angus Andrew. The album's sound is characterized by pounding drums, highly distorted guitar drones, and falsetto vocals. Upon initial release, the album featured a DVD with three different music videos for each song. The album's title and several track names refer to two fictional characters‚ÄîDrum and Mount Heart Attack‚Äîwho, according to the band, each represent a state of being, √† la yin and yang. Drum is assertive and productive, the spirit of creative confidence. With two drum kits integral to many of these percussive, propulsive, highly rhythmic convulsions, Drum came to be acknowledged as a fourth member of the band. Conversely, Mount Heart Attack is the reaction to Drum's action, the embodiment of stress and self-doubt. Both became key elements in the creative process. Pitchfork ranked the album number 6 on their list of the Top 50 albums of 2006. Track listing # \\"Be Quiet Mt. Heart Attack!\\" ‚Äì 3:28 # \\"Let's Not Wrestle Mt.

The park is at or near the site of an earlier garden Furong Garden complex in the city of Chang'an, capital of Tang Dynasty, but consists almost entirely of modern construction. The park features numerous buildings, squares, and gardens, all incorporating features of traditional Tang Chinese architecture, such as eaves and cornices. Some features are named after historical sites or buildings. The park is one of several modern reconstructions of ancient sites in Shaanxi, which involve anachronistic styles and features, most notably the use of wide stretches of concrete surfaces. The setting, a landscaped site surrounding a willow-lined lake, captures something of the look and feel of classical Chinese landscape painting.

It is the lead school of the Weydon Multi Academy Trust. History Opened as Weydon County Secondary School on 16 September 1957. The first headmaster (1957 to 1968) was Mr A H Surman, who was succeeded by Mr Chambers. By that time there were some 500 students in 5 academic years, years 1 to 4 divided into four streams based on perceived ability/achievement, year 5 divided into 2 streams, students from the lower 2 streams having left at age 15. Weydon School was granted Specialist Science Status in 2003. Site Currently the school caters for children from 11 to 16. Its main feeder schools are Highfield South Farnham, Potters Gate CE Primary School, Rowledge CE Primary School, St Peter's School, South Farnham School and Waverley Abbey Junior School. The majority of the students go on from Weydon to The Sixth Form College, Farnborough, Farnham College, Alton College or Godalming College. Weydon School underwent expansion in 2008 as part of the Faraday project funded by the Government and aimed to increase attainment levels in science. Weydon was selected as one of only a few schools throughout the country to receive this grant. The money was spent on a new high tech science computer room, 'rainforest room' and state of the art labs were built over a summer. A further expansion project was announced in 2013, with work starting in 2014. It expanded the cafeteria (previously known as Breakpoint Cafe), built new changing rooms and rebuilt the arts and humanities departments. The new 'Medici' art block was opened on 4 March 2016 containing a state-of-the- art theatre, art rooms and additional facilities. Multiple performances have been displayed within the Medici theatre alongside art displays throughout the year.

The building contains the LRC (Learning Resource Centre), consisting of a extensive library and computer suite. Organisation The school is split into two 'colleges' - River and Castle. These aim to create a small-school feeling as the school grows in enrolment numbers. Within the two colleges, students are organised into a tutor group of 28-30 students. The tutor groups are named after famous British rivers or castles. The Castle tutor groups are: Arundel, Newark, Pendragon, Ravensworth, Sterling, Windsor; The River tutor groups are: Avon, Clyde, Eden, Mersey, Severn, Tyne.

In communication In communication theory and especially in relevance theory, ostensive behaviour or ostension is a behaviour that signals the intention to communicate something. This can be a gesture such as pointing, or shifting position to draw an addressee's attention to something.Sperber, Dan; Wilson, Deirdre. Relevance. pp 29, 49. Verbal communication (the act of speaking or writing something) is also ostensive behaviour, as it draws the addressee's attention to the fact that the communicator intends to convey some information. This is called the communicative intention. By contrast, the informative intention is the intention to convey said information, i.e. the actual content of the message. In folklore The term ostension is also used by those who study folklore and urban legends to indicate real-life happenings that parallel the events told in pre-existing and well-established legends and lore. Semiotician Umberto Eco was the first to use the term to describe the way in which people communicate messages through miming actions, as by holding up a pack of cigarettes to say, \\"Would you like one?\\"Eco, Umberto. A Theory of Semiotics. pp 224‚Äì26. The concept was applied to contemporary legends by folklorists Linda D√©gh and Andrew V√°zsonyi, who argued that the most direct form of ostension involved committing an actual crime mentioned in a well- known urban legend, such as microwaving someone's pet animal or placing poison in a child's Halloween candy. While such events are rare, the authors stressed that folklorists must recognize \\"that fact can become narrative and narrative can become fact.\\" D√©gh and V√°zsonyi, followed by other analysts, argued that there were two other forms of ostension that did not necessarily involve literal acting out of legends. Quasi-ostension involves interpretation of ambiguous events in terms of a legend, as when a murder is first believed to have been a \\"cult\\" sacrifice or \\"gang\\" murder when in fact the perpetrator had other motives. Many local media panics are based in this form of ostension.Ellis, Bill. Legend-Trips and Satanism: Adolescents' Ostensive Traditions as \\"Cult\\" Activity. In Richardson et al., The Satanism Scare, pp 279‚Äì295. Pseudo-ostension involves legend-like events intentionally acted out by persons aware of the original narrative. For example, in 1991, Ebony published a letter written by \\"C.J.\\" a Dallas-area woman who said she was HIV- positive, but intentionally having sex with as many men as possible. Soon after, a local radio talk-show broadcast a phone call from a woman who said she was the real \\"C.J.\\" \\"I blame it on men, period,\\" she said to the talk-show host. \\"I'm doing it to all the men because it was a man that gave it to me.\\" After a huge spike in males seeking HIV screening in the Dallas-Fort-Worth area, both the author of the letter and the talk-show caller were identified as hoaxers intending to raise consciousness of the disease.FOAFTale News 25 (March 1992): p 11. Ostension has become an important concept for folklorists studying the ways in which folklore affects everyday people's real lives, ranging from supernatural rituals such as legend tripping to the complex ways in which awareness of AIDS has affected people's sexual habits.Goldstein, Diane. Once upon a Virus (2004). Folklorist John McDowell, in an article preceding D√©gh and V√°zsonyi by a year, explored the relationship between iconicity‚Äîrepresentation‚Äîand ostension‚Äîpresentation‚Äîin mythic narrative, finding in episodes of ostention a virtual encounter with the experiential substrate, an experience that he termed \\"narrative epiphany\\".\\"Beyond Iconicity: Ostension in Kamsa Mythic Narrative, Journal of the Folklore Institute 19 (1982). pp 119‚Äì139.

It tells the story of a squad of U.S. soldiers from the 95th Infantry Division who, in the fall of 1944, must hold off an entire German company for approximately 48 hours along the Siegfried Line until reinforcements reach them. Plot Montigny, Meurthe-et-Moselle, 1944: Squad leader Sergeant Larkin (Harry Guardino) and his men are taking a well-deserved rest behind the lines after conducting front-line combat operations for several weeks. Rumor has it the unit will be rotated state-side and the men are almost giddy in anticipation. During an interlude at a church and later at a tavern, the senior non-commissioned officer, Platoon Sergeant Pike (Fess Parker), happens upon acquaintance Private John Reese (Steve McQueen) who has been assigned to his platoon. Reese was a former master sergeant, demoted to private after a court martial, who walks about armed with a distinctive M3 submachine gun. Reese is the quintessential troubled loner, managing to alienate almost everyone in the squad right from the beginning. Unlike his jubilant comrades, the prospect of a long break from combat, perhaps the end of the war itself, renders Reese morose. The company commander, Captain Loomis (Joseph Hoover), is worried because Reese, although already having won a Distinguished Service Cross, acts irresponsibly when there is no fighting, but Pike comments that he is a good soldier in combat. Pike informs the men that they will shortly be going back on the line rather than home. After much bitter complaining, the men get ready to move out. The remaining members of 2nd Squad include con-man/scavenger Corby (Bobby Darin); Corporal Henshaw (James Coburn), a mechanic who can fix anything; the easy-going, somewhat- naive kid, Cumberly (Bill Mullikin); and family man Kolinsky (Mike Kellin). The squad has their own mascot, a young Polish displaced person Homer Janeczek (Nick Adams), who is not a soldier, but stays with the squad in hopes of accompanying the men upon their return to the United States. The morning after they arrive at their appointed post and dig in, the men realize that an unannounced overnight withdrawal of the main American force has left them spread dangerously thin. Finally, Pike arrives to explain the situation, which only heightens everyone's awareness that any reconnaissance by the Germans across the valley will quickly reveal how weak the American defenses are there. One stroke of good luck is the sudden and mistaken arrival of an Army company clerk, Private First Class James Driscoll (Bob Newhart in his first film role). Larkin quickly puts Driscoll‚Äôs jeep to use by having Henshaw drive it back and forth behind their lines, after rigging it to backfire and sound like a tank, in an attempt to fool the Germans. Driscoll himself is put to use improvising misleading radio messages for a hidden microphone, discovered by Corby, left by the Germans in an abandoned pillbox (Newhart was noted for his telephone conversation skits in his stand-up comedy routines). Additionally, Larkin has his men run wire to three empty ammo cans, partially filled with rocks and hung from trees, distributed along gaps in their front lines, which they can pull to create noise to make the Germans believe that a much larger American force is present. A German raid results in Cumberly's death, but Reese manages to eliminate three Germans in close combat. Worried that the German survivors will report on the understrength American lines, Reese recommends attacking a large, opposing German pillbox, flanked by a minefield and barbed wire, to make the enemy pause and convince them the Americans are at normal strength. Larkin, fearing an overwhelming enemy assault on their positions, decides to go find Pike and obtain his permission for the pillbox attack. Unable to locate Pike because he has gone to the rear, Larkin returns and berates Reese when he finds out Henshaw, whom Larkin had put in charge in his absence, had been convinced by Reese to go to a supply dump to obtain satchel charges. After a heated argument with Reese, Larkin is killed in an artillery barrage. Reese decides to proceed without orders and two others, Henshaw and Kolinsky, go along. Shortly after they set out, Sgt. Pike and the rest of the company begins to return to the line. The squad's attack fails when Henshaw accidentally sets off an undetected S-mine, fatally burning with the exploding flamethrower tanks he carries, as well as illuminating the battlefield. Reese and Kolinsky retreat, covered by smoke from the company mortar squad. As they run back to their lines, Kolinsky is struck by shrapnel through the back and abdomen, and finally dies, screaming about his guts, as a medic and others attend to his wounds. A furious Captain Loomis berates Reese and promises him a court-martial for defying orders to hold the line, but only after the American assault at dawn. The dominant German pillbox fires on the advancing Americans, who press on despite heavy casualties. Determined to eliminate the pillbox, Reese gets within striking range, aided by Corby, manning a flamethrower. Reese throws a satchel charge into the pillbox, but, in the process, is wounded in the back and stomach. When the unexploded satchel charge is tossed out by the alert defenders, the wounded Reese retrieves it and carries it back through the pillbox opening, blowing up the fortification's occupants and himself. Corby, at Pike's command, directs his flamethrower at the blown-out pillbox window, until it is engulfed with fire, as the Americans continue to advance, and fall, to other unseen German weapons.

He gained quite a name for himself after writing the script for the 1949 film Battleground, about the American 101st Airborne Division paratroopers‚Äô defense of Bastogne, then writing and directing Go for Broke!, a 1951 war film about the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Soon after Hell Is for Heroes, he created the World War II TV series Combat!. Pirosh based some of the events in his film on his unit being withdrawn from the Vosges area to move towards the Battle of the Bulge, with their former positions in the line held by a small force in a then-classified deception operation. Pirosh based Nick Adams' Polish character on an actual Displaced Person who followed his unit around.pp.111-112 Rubin, Steven Jay Combat Films: American Realism, 1945-2010, 2nd edition. McFarland, 1 Jan 1981 Originally, Pirosh was also to have directed and produced the film, but he walked away from the project after trouble with McQueen. Pirosh's screenplay was originally entitled Separation Hill, but the title was changed by Paramount's publicity office as being too close to the 1959 Korean War film Pork Chop Hill (which Harry Guardino had been in) .Rubin, Steven Jay Combat Films: American Realism, 1945-2010 2d edition McFarland, 1 Jan 1981 Many of the cast were angry over the studio's budget restrictions, which resulted in phony looking props, malfunctioning firearms and the same German having to be killed three or four times. In the last battle scene, McQueen can be seen experiencing multiple failures firing the M3 Grease Gun. These malfunctions were due to problems with the blanks used. McQueen was reportedly furious with his agent for having induced him to sign onto the film and not securing the fee that he had been promised up front and for passing on another movie that he wanted. Thus, his angry, detached \\"loner\\" look may not have been entirely due to his method acting. Columnist James Bacon visited the set and said that \\"Steve McQueen is his own worst enemy\\". Bobby Darin overheard the remark and replied, \\"Not while I'm still alive.\\" Bob Newhart said that he had been offered the film a year previous and found that the script had changed when Steve McQueen came on board; Newhart believed the original script had been set to feature Darin as the main star of the film.p.106 Starr, Michael Seth Bobby Darin: A Life Taylor Trade Publications, 1 Feb 2011 McQueen and Siegel were continuously at odds during the production, with the two nearly coming to blows several times. In one scene, when McQueen was unable to cry while on camera, Siegel resorted to slapping him hard and blowing onion juice into his face, before administering eye drops that ran down the actor's face. Parker, Coburn and others in the cast were working on other projects during the making of the film and would repeatedly show up in the nick of time and do their lines without makeup and little or no rehearsal. (Coburn also appeared with McQueen in The Magnificent Seven and another World War II film, The Great Escape as well as appearing in a couple of episodes of McQueen's 1950s western television series Wanted: Dead or Alive.) Due to the intense heat of the 1961 summer in Cottonwood and Redding, California, many of the scenes were shot at night for the comfort of the actors. During the production, Newhart's comedy albums were selling unexpectedly well, resulting in higher fee offers for stand-up comedy nightclub appearances. As a result, he sought ways to have his character killed off so that he could leave the production. The director consistently told him that he would be in the film until the end. Both Newhart and Parker recalled that the film ended abruptly due to Paramount shortening the production of the film for financial reasons. A novelisation of the screenplay was written by Curt Anders. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Several of the guest characters in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"The Siege of AR-558\\" are named after characters and actors from this film. These include Patrick Kilpatrick's character Reese, Annette Helde's character Larkin and Bill Mumy's character Kellin (named after the actor Mike Kellin). Unseen characters named after characters from the film include Captain Loomis and Commander Parker. The episode has a similar plot, where Starfleet troops have been holding off repeated attacks from enemy forces for five months.

Since 2015, it has been based in Arbon, Canton Thurgau, Switzerland. The EDAG Group is one of the world's largest independent development partners to the automotive industry and aviation industry. The holding which incorporated the company was founded in Germany during 1969. During 1987, EDAG Group's first overseas branch office was opened in Martorell (Barcelona), Spain. Since incorporation, its structure has been changed several times, including operations as an Aktiengesellschaft, a joint-stock company and a Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien. The main operational company of the EDAG Group is EDAG Engineering GmbH, which is based in Wiesbaden, Germany. By November 2018, the company was reportedly operating from 60 sites across 19 countries. It is active in the fields of product development, production plant development, plant engineering, limited series manufacturing, modules, and optimization.  History  On 1 February 1969, the company Eckard Design was founded by Horst Eckard in Gro√ü-Zimmern, outside Darmstadt. The firm's first customer was the car manufacturer Ford at their works in Cologne; the firm's first offices were also established in this city. Before the end of its first year, another customer in the form of local car manufacturer BMW had also been acquired. By the end of 1969, Eckard Design employed a total of eight staff members, some of whom would become key officials of the business for the next 30 years. During 1970, a new head office was opened in Fulda; the city's central location meant that Eckard Design's headquarters were never more that 300 km away from any of the domestic car manufacturers. Two years later, additional offices in neighbouring Steinau were also secured; that same year, turnover breached DM 2 million for the first time. In 1973, Volkswagen became a customer of the firm, while turnover rose to DM 3.3 million. During the following year, the company was reorganised as Eckard Design GbR; it also completed its first acquisition, that being of the M√ºcke-based manufacturing company FFT. In 1975, vehicle manufacturer Opel became a client of Eckard Design, while a major order for Karmann was placed during the following year. During the late 1970s, a close working relationship with Audi also developed. In 1981, company turnover exceeded DM 20 million for the first time; the Fulda office was enlarged during the following year. In 1983, Eckard Design began investing in computer- aided design (CAD) technology in line with clients such as Audi. Headcount reached 250 during 1984, while the firm's offices continued to expand. Since 1986, the firm has also been involved in the construction of prototypes at its own experimental shop in Fulda. One year later, the company launched its first international activities, deciding to open its first overseas branch office in Martorell (Barcelona), Spain. During 1989, its 20th anniversary, turnover breached the DM 100 million milestone; the same year, the company received its first order from Italian luxury car specialist Ferrari. During the early 1990s, considerable investment was directed into growth into the international automotive market. During 1992, the company's Rechtsform was reorganised, when it became an Aktiengesellschaft and the name Edag Engineering + Design AG came into being. In 1998, EDAG was the first automotive service provider to be admitted to the Verband der Automobilindustrie (English: Association of the German Automotive Industry). During 2004, FFT Flexible Fertigungstechnik GmbH & Co. KG, which is presently called FFT Produktionssysteme GmbH & Co. KG, was integrated into the company. In February 2006, Lutz Helmig, owner of Aton GmbH and founder of the Helios-Kliniken, purchased EDAG from the nine founding families. In 2007, personnel service provider ED Work GmbH & Co. KG was founded. As a result of the takeover by Aton GmbH, the legal form of the company changed on 11 January 2008 from a joint-stock company to a Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien. A further consequence of the re-structuring was that directors Klaus Blickle and J√ºrgen B√∂hm left the company on 8 April 2008, and were replaced by long-standing managers J√∂rg Ohlsen, Manfred Hahl and Rainer Bauer. As a consequence of the merger with R√ºcker GmbH during early 2014, the executive board was re-structured, while the head office was transferred to Wiesbaden. Since March 2015, EDAG has been operating under the name EDAG Engineering GmbH. With the listing of EDAG Engineering Group AG on the German stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main (Prime Standard), ISIN 0303692047, EDAG Engineering GmbH became part of EDAG Engineering Group AG. The vast majority of EDAG Group's revenue has typically been derived from its activity in the automotive sector, comprising 62 percent of turnover during 2017; other major contributors to turnover include its electronics businesses, contributing 20 percent that year, as well as a further 18 percent from production solutions activities for that same year. According to market analysts Edison Group, EDAG has been increasingly moving its activities into the international market in recent years; however, it has been facing increasingly intensive competition from rivals on the global stage. For several decades, EDAG has been active throughout the aerospace sector. During the early 2000s, aircraft manufacturer AvCraft contracted EDAD to produce wing tooling for a new final assembly line at Oberpfaffenhoffen for the Fairchild- Dornier 328JET. The company has acted as an intermediate party between various other suppliers and the multinational aerospace conglomerate Airbus.  Offices  The branch offices on five continents are mostly located at important sites of partner industries. ;Selection of sites in Germany::Aachen, Eisenach, Fulda, Hamburg, Ingolstadt, Cologne, Leipzig, Munich, Rostock, Ulm, Wolfsburg ;Selection of sites in Europe * Mlad√° Boleslav ‚Äì * B≈ôeclav ‚Äì * Warwickshire ‚Äì * Gy≈ër ‚Äì * Gothenburg - * Helmond - * Kocaeli ‚Äì ; ;Worldwide * S√£o Bernardo do Campo (S√£o Paulo) ‚Äì * Troy (Detroit) ‚Äì * Puebla ‚Äì * Yokohama ‚Äì * Seoul - * Shah Alam (Kuala Lumpur) ‚Äì * Pune (Maharashtra) ‚Äì * Shanghai ‚Äì *  Automotive industry  EDAG is noted for its concept cars such as EDAG Biwak estate concept on the Beetle, the EDAG Pontiac Solstice Hardtop and the EDAG Show Car No. 8 based on Smart mechanicals.

Broteas was also one of the Lapiths, killed at the battle of the Lapiths and the centaurs.Ovid. Metamorphoses xii, 260 Historical accounts Broteas was consumed on a pyre as a propitiating sacrifice. The mythic rationale, that he was a famous hunter who refused to honour Artemis. Artemis then drove him mad, causing him to immolate himself.\\"I think that this is an aetiological myth, intended to explain the rite in which a human effigy was burnt upon a pyre in the festival of the hunters' goddess,\\" observes Martin P. Nilsson, \\"Fire-Festivals in Ancient Greece\\", The Journal of Hellenic Studies 43.2 (1923:144-148) p. 144 note 2; Nilsson cites pseudo-Apollodorus, Epitome II.2. He can be compared to the hunter Actaeon, whose sacrifice is also justified as retribution. Broteas had a son Tantalus, like his grandfather. A Hesiodic papyrus fragment from Oxyrhyncus connects Dardanus, Broteas and Pandion, in a tradition of which there is no further evidence.The Oxyrhyncus Papyri, ed. E. Lobel, part xxviii (1963), no. 2503.  Manisa relief  This ancient rock carving was famous in antiquity. It's located near the town of Magnesia ad Sipylum, and it was believed to have been carved by Broteas. He was said to have carved the most ancient image of the Great Mother of the Gods (Cybele), an image that in Pausanias' day (2nd century CE) was still held sacred by the Magnesians. The sculpture was carved into the rock- face of the crag Coddinus, north of Spil Mount-Mount Sipylus, whose daemon was one of the mythographers' candidates for Broteas' grandfather.Pausanias. Descriptions of Greece, iii.22.4. \\"the Magnesians, who live to the north of Mount Sipylus (Spil Mount), have on the rock Coddinus the most ancient of all the images of the Mother of the gods. The Magnesians say that it was made by Broteas the son of Tantalus.\\" The rock-cut carving mentioned by Pausanias was identified with the Manisa relief in 1881 by W. M. RamsayW. M. Ramsay in The Journal of Hellenic Studies (1882:64) and Ramsay, \\"A Study of Phrygian Art\\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies 9 (1888:350-382). and is still to be seen above the road about 6 or 7 km east of Manisa (the modern descendant of Magnesia ad Sipylum), though the head has partly cleaved away, from natural causes.G.E.

The figure 8‚Äì10 metres high carved in a recess in the a cliff-face a hundred metres above the marshy plain near the village of Akpinar, has come to be confused with a nearby natural rock formation associated with Niobe, the \\"Niobe of Sipylus\\" (the \\"Weeping Rock\\", in Turkish Aƒülayan Kaya), also mentioned by Pausanias.Pausanias. Descriptions of Greece, i.21.3. \\"this Niobe I myself saw when I had gone up to Mount Sipylus (Spil Mount). When you are near it is a beetling crag, with not the slightest resemblance to a woman, mourning or otherwise; but if you go further away you will think you see a woman in tears, with head bowed down\\". Apart from the badly damaged head, the sitting figure is clear enough to be made out by a non-professional. The goddess with the polos headgear holds her breasts with her hands; a vague trace of four Hittite hieroglyphics could be seen on a squared section to the right of her head. The site is Hittite, second millennium BCE. Nearby, other archaeological sites traditionally associated with the House of Tantalus since Antiquity are also in fact Hittite. Some 2 km east of Akpƒ±nar there are another two monuments on Spil Mount, which are also mentioned by Pausanias: the tomb of Tantalus (Christianized as \\"Saint Charalambos' tomb\\") and the \\"throne of Pelops\\", in fact a rocky altar.  Brotheus and Renaissance invective In literature of the Renaissance and later, Broteas is most often called \\"Brotheus\\" and described as a son of Vulcan who cast himself into the flames, sometimes specified as those of Mount Aetna, because of his deformity. The immediate source for the Renaissance trope of Brotheus and his self-immolation was Ovid's curse poem Ibis, an erudite rant of gruesome threats cataloguing the fates of numerous mythic and historical figures. Ovid's reference is minimal: \\"May you consign your body parts, set on fire, to the pyre to be cremated, as they say Broteas did out of a desire for death.\\"Quodque ferunt Brotean fecisse cupidine mortis, / Des tua succensae membra cremanda pyrae, Ovid, Ibis 519‚Äì520 (517‚Äì518 in some editions). The Italian humanist and literary agitator Domizio Calderini, also known in Latin as Domitius Calderinus, appended the Ibis to his annotated edition of Martial (1474). Calderini's note says that Brotheus was the son of Vulcan and Minerva; scorned because of his ugliness, he cast himself into a burning pyre.Calderini goes on to identify Brotheus with Erichthonius. The scholia and Renaissance commentaries are discussed at length in Peter Burman's 1727 edition of the Ibis, p. 130 online. The same year, drawing on his classical sources, Calderini published a Defensio adversus Brotheum (\\"Defense against Brotheus\\"), an attack on his literary rivals Angelo Sabino and Niccol√≤ Perotti under the pseudonyms \\"Fidentinus,\\" after the plagiarist in Book 1 of Martial's epigrams, and \\"Brotheus.\\" The literary feud is mentioned in several sources, including Gyraldus, and its notoriety helped establish the predominant version of the myth in the 15th‚Äì18th centuries.Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus, De poetis nostrorum temporum 25 (Berlin, 1894), Wotke p. 20 online,; Paul Cortese (Paulus Cortesus), De hominibus doctis dialogus in the edition of Gabriel Richards (Florence, 1734), p. 49 online; Friedrich Gotthilf Freytag, Adparatus litterarius (Leipzig, 1753), vol. 2, p. 1378 online; W.

For further discussion of this literary feud, see Angelo Sabino. The idiosyncratic but enormously influential Mythologiae of Natalis Comes (1567) uses this version in a chapter on the aspects of Vulcan and his progeny: \\"Brotheus, who was mocked by everyone because of his ill-formed appearance, hurled himself into the fire, as if to escape libel by death.\\"Natalis Comes, Mythologiae 2.6, p. 101, line 43 in the Venice edition of 1581: Brothe√ª, qui irrisus ab omnibus propter deformitatem oris in ignem se coniecit vel morte infamiam deuitaturus.

On September 9, 1969, the aircraft serving the flight, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, collided in mid-air with a Piper PA-28 light aircraft near Fairland, Indiana. The DC-9 was carrying 78 passengers and 4 crew members, and the Piper was leased to a student pilot on a solo cross-country flight. All 83 occupants of both aircraft were killed in the accident and both aircraft were destroyed.  Flight history  Allegheny Airlines Flight 853 was a regularly scheduled flight departing Boston for Baltimore, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and St. Louis. Captain James Elrod (47) and First Officer William Heckendorn (26) were at the controls. Elrod was a seasoned veteran with more than 23,800 flight hours. The flight left Cincinnati at 3:15 pm en route to Indianapolis. They were flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) clearance to Indianapolis, and Approach Control instructed them to descend to 2,500 feet after passing the Shelbyville VOR at 6,000 feet. The flight was then vectored to a 280 degree heading. Meanwhile, the private Piper PA-28 piloted by Robert Carey (34) was on a southeasterly heading. It was operating under a filed visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan which indicated a cruising altitude of 3,500 feet. It was not in communication with Air Traffic Control and was not equipped with a transponder, and there was no evidence that it appeared as a primary radar target on the radarscope. The two aircraft converged at a relative speed of . The initial point of impact was at the top front right section of the DC-9's vertical stabilizer, just underneath the horizontal stabilizer. On the Piper, the impact point was just forward of the left wing root. The impact severed the entire tail assembly of the DC-9, which inverted and plowed into a soybean field at an approximate speed of about 100 yards north of the Shady Acres mobile home park.  Probable cause  The National Transportation Safety Board released the following probable cause in a report adopted July 15, 1970: > The Board determines the probable cause of this accident to be the > deficiencies in the collision avoidance capability of the Air Traffic > Control system of the FAA in a terminal area wherein there was mixed > instrument flight rules (IFR) and visual flight rules (VFR) traffic. The > deficiencies included the inadequacy of the see-and-avoid concept under the > circumstances of this case; the technical limitations of radar in detecting > all aircraft; and the absence of Federal Aviation Regulations which would > provide a system of adequate separation of mixed VFR and IFR traffic in > terminal areas.  Legacy  The NTSB and FAA realized the inherent limitations of the \\"see and be seen\\" principle of air traffic separation in visual meteorological conditions, especially involving aircraft of dissimilar speeds or cloud layers and other restrictions to visibility. Over a period of years, following similar incidents and taking advantage of technological advances, the two agencies drove a number of corrective steps for the aviation industry, including: * Transponders are now installed in most general aviation aircraft and all commercial aircraft, dramatically increasing radar visibility of lower and slower-flying smaller aircraft, especially near atmospheric disturbances or other clutter (see Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System and Secondary Surveillance Radar) * Most airports with scheduled airline service now have a surrounding controlled airspace (ICAO designation Class B or Class C) for improved IFR and VFR traffic separation; all aircraft must be transponder- equipped and in communication with air traffic control to operate within this controlled airspace * Most commercial and air-carrier aircraft now have an airborne collision avoidance or TCAS device on board that can detect and warn about nearby transponder-equipped traffic * ATC radar systems now have \\"conflict alert\\"‚Äîautomated ground-based collision avoidance software that sounds an alarm when aircraft come within a minimum safe separation distanceNTSB Conflict Alert Safety Recommendation, 2003  See also  * List of notable civilian mid-air collisions * Aerom√©xico Flight 498 * Piedmont Airlines Flight 22 * PSA Flight 182 *TWA Flight 533  References   External links  1969 in Indiana Allegheny Airlines accidents and incidents Airliner accidents and incidents in Indiana Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1969 Accidents and incidents involving the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Airliner accidents and incidents involving mid-air collisions Shelby County, Indiana September 1969 events in the United States ","title":"Allegheny Airlines Flight 853"},{"id":"4336324","text":"Andrew Wills (born 3 January 1972) is a former Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League.

Classification \\"Dasygnathus\\" longidens was created by Thomas Huxley for a maxilla from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in 1877. The genus name Dasygnathus had already been used for a coleopteran insect, so Oskar Kuhn renamed it Dasygnathoides.Kukn, O., 1961, Fossilium Catalogus I: Animalia, Reptila, supplementum 1, n. 2, p. 1-163. Although synonymized with Ornithosuchus by Walker (1964), a 2016 study found Dasygnathoides indeterminate beyond Pseudosuchia. For this reason, many paleontologists consider 'Dasygnathoides' a nomem dubium. The lack of synapomorphies shared by ornithosuchids indicates that Dasygnathoides was not an ornithosuchid as previously thought, but there are no links between it and any other family of pseudosuchians. It has remained impossible to resolve further. The morphology of the maxilla is quite different from aetosaurs, silesaurids, erpetosuchians, saurischians or ornithischians. The interdental plates also differ greatly from erythrosuchids and proterosuchids. Dasygnathoides cannot be assigned to any particular group of pseudosuchians at present. It is probably the first or only specimen of an entirely new group.  History  Thomas Huxley first found the maxilla in the Lossiemouth Sandstone in 1859, and originally identified it as Stagonolepis, due to its very similar tooth implantation pattern. He later changed his mind and reidentified it as a new species, \\"Dasygnathus\\". This name later had to be changed in 1961 as it had already been used for a beetle. In 1964, the specimen of Dasygnathoides was compared with all the known Ornithosuchus specimens and then synonymized by Walker. This was due to the shared presence of 'rear forking' at the posterior end of the maxillae, only nine maxillary teeth, and the similarity between their right pterygoid bones. In 2016, M. Bel√©n von Baczko and M. Ezcurra reassessed this synonymization and found that Dasygnathoides was in fact a much larger and quite different species to Ornithosuchus, and not even an ornithosuchid (see above).  Features  Dasygnathoides is known from a right maxilla and pterygoid, a partial vertebra, a haemal arch and a phalanx, an articular and an osteoderm. They all come from the same animal. There was also a small radius and ulna found in the slab, but this was far too small to have been from the same specimen and can probably be discounted as stomach contents. The total skull length is estimated to have been about 450 mm, almost twice as long as the largest Ornithosuchus skull found, and the entire animal was probably between 3 and 4 metres long. It is the largest predatory tetrapod known from Triassic Scotland. = Maxilla (ELGNM 1) = The maxilla found has four teeth remaining in it and nine interdental plates, showing that five teeth are missing. The total length of the maxilla is 195 mm and the teeth range from 29.5 mm to 53.5 mm long. The teeth are posteriorly curved and have sharp edges, indicating that they might have been used as blades to slice flesh rather than merely to impale and grip. The interdental plates are pentagonal, would have formed the medial walls of the tooth sockets, and in life were richly supplied with blood vessels, giving them a rather wrinkled look. No ascending or palatal process can be found on the specimen, and nor can the 'rear forking prong' mentioned above. Indeed, the prong mentioned can only be found on a single specimen of Ornithosuchus. = Pterygoid (ELGNM 15) = This specimen shows the dorsal surface of the right pterygoid bone, and a small part of either a palatine or vomer bone. It is 164 mm long. The anterior ramus is narrow and tapering, but the medial margin is thick and the quadrate ramus is almost as wide as it is long. Th quadrate ramus is dorsally curved and bears a groove extending anterolaterally. Unlike Ornithosuchus, Dasygnathoides did not appear to have a palatine-pterygoid fenestra as the homologous area of bone is curved outwards. This indicates that, in fact, it is not an ornithosuchan at all. The partial vertebra is found in the same piece of stone as the maxilla. It has a well- developed transverse process and is probably a dorsal or anterior caudal vertebra. = Haemal arch & phalanx (ELGNM 15) and possible articular (ELGNM 29) = These are small and fragmentary, and little information can be gained from them. It is possible that they are, in fact, stomach or throat contents of the actual Dasygnathoides fossil. = Osteoderm (ELGNM unnumbered) = This was previously identified as a possible nasal bone, but is far more likely to be an osteoderm indicating that Dasygnathoides had skin armour. It resembles the elongated osteoderms of Ornithosuchus.

Preiddeu Annwfn or Preiddeu Annwn () is a cryptic poem of sixty lines in Middle Welsh, found in the Book of Taliesin. The text recounts an expedition with King Arthur to Annwfn or Annwn, the Welsh name for the Celtic Otherworld. Preiddeu Annwfn is one of the best known of medieval British poems. English translations, in whole or in part, have been published by R. Williams (in William Forbes Skene's Four Ancient Books of Wales), by Robert Graves in The White Goddess and by Roger Sherman Loomis, Herbert Pilch, John T. Koch, Marged Haycock, John K. Bollard, Sarah Higley. At some points it requires individual interpretation on the part of its translators owing to its terse style, the ambiguities of its vocabulary, its survival in a single copy of doubtful reliability, the lack of exact analogues of the tale it tells and the host of real or fancied resonances with other poems and tales. A number of scholars (in particular, Marshall H. James, who points out the remarkable similarity in Line 1, of Verse 2 in \\"Mic Dinbych\\", from the Black Book of Carmarthen), have pointed out analogues in other medieval Welsh literature: some suggest that it represents a tradition that evolved into the grail of Arthurian literature. Haycock (in The Figure of Taliesin) was the first to point out that the poem is \\"about Taliesin and his vaunting of knowledge\\", and Higley calls the poem \\"a metaphor of its own making‚Äîa poem about the material 'spoils' of poetic composition\\".Higley, note to introduction Manuscript and date The poem is uniquely preserved in the Book of Taliesin (Aberystwyth, NLW, MS Peniarth 2), which has been dated to the first quarter of the 14th century.Haycock, Preiddeu Annwn, p. 52. The text of the poem itself has proved immensely difficult to date. Estimates range from the time of the bard Taliesin in the late 6th century to that of the completion of the manuscript. On the basis of linguistic criteria Norris J. Lacy suggests that the poem took its present form around AD 900.Lacy, Norris J. (1991). \\"The Spoils of Annwfn (Preiddeu Annwfn).\\" In Lacy, Norris J., The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 428. New York: Garland. . Marged Haycock notes that the poem shares a formal peculiarity with a number of pre-Gogynfeirdd poems found in the Book of Taliesin, that is, the caesura usually divides the lines into a longer and shorter section.Haycock, Preiddeu Annwn, pp. 52-3. She contends, however, that there is no firm linguistic evidence that the poem predates the time of the Gogynfeirdd.Haycock, Preiddeu Annwn, p. 57. Text The poem may be divided into eight stanzas, each for the most part united by a single rhyme but with irregular numbers of lines. The first stanza begins and the last ends with two lines of praise to the Lord, generally taken to be Christian. In the last couplet of each stanza except the last the speaker mentions a dangerous journey into Annwfn with Arthur and three boat-loads of men, of whom only seven returned, presumably with the \\"spoils\\" from Annwfn. Annwfn is apparently referred to by several names, including \\"Mound or Fairy Fortress,\\" \\"Four Peaked or Cornered Fortress,\\" and \\"Glass Fortress\\", though it is possible these are intended to be distinct. Whatever tragedy occurred is not clearly explained. Each stanza except the last two begins in the first person; the first begins \\"I praise the Lord\\", the second and third \\"I am honoured in praise\\", the next three declare \\"I do not merit little men\\" who rely on books and lack understanding. The last two refer to crowds of monks who again rely upon the words and the knowledge of authorities and lack the type of experience the poem claims. Between these beginnings and ends the first six stanzas offer brief allusions to the journey. In the first Gweir is encountered imprisoned in the fort's walls, a character whom Rachel Bromwich associates with Gwair, one of \\"Three Exalted Prisoners of Britain\\" known from the Welsh Triads.Triad 52. see Trioedd Ynys Prydein pp. 146‚Äì147 and 373‚Äì374. He is imprisoned in chains, apparently until Judgment Day, singing before the spoils of Annwfn. The second stanza describes the cauldron of the Chief of Annwn, finished with pearl, and how it was taken, presumably being itself the \\"spoils\\". The third and fourth allude to difficulties with the forces of Annwfn while the fifth and sixth describe a great ox, also richly decorated, that may also form part of Arthur's spoils. The first stanza has already mentioned Pwyll, the legendary prince of Dyfed who in the first branch of the Mabinogi becomes the Chief of Annwfn after helping its king, Arawn, and was credited with ownership of a cauldron. The speaker may be intended to be Taliesin himself, for the second stanza says \\"my poetry, from the cauldron it was uttered, from the breath of nine maidens it was kindled, the cauldron of the chief of Annwfyn\\" and Taliesin's name is connected to a similar story in the legend of his birth.Higley, note to Preiddeu Annwn, Stanza II, line 13. Song is heard in the fourfold fort, which therefore seems also to be Annwfn: Gweir was imprisoned in perpetual song before a cauldron that first gave out poetry when breathed upon by nine maidens, reminiscent of the nine muses of classical thought. Just as, we are told, the cauldron \\"does not boil the food of a coward\\", so the song it is inspires is \\"honoured in praise\\", too good for petty men of ordinary mentality. Analogues and interpretations Two works in particular, the tale of Bran the Blessed in the Second Branch of the Mabinogi and a tale included in Culhwch and Olwen in which Arthur's retinue sail to Ireland aboard Prydwen (the ship used in Preiddeu) to obtain the Cauldron of Diwrnach, are frequently cited as narratives resembling that of the present poem. =Bran and Branwen= In the Second Branch Bran gives his magic life-restoring cauldron to his new brother-in-law Matholwch of Ireland when he marries Bran's sister Branwen. Matholwch mistreats his new wife and Bran's men cross the Irish Sea to rescue her. This attack involves the destruction of the cauldron, which Matholwch uses to resuscitate his soldiers. There is a battle between the hosts and in the end only seven of Bran's men escape alive, including Taliesin and Pryderi. =Arthur and Diwrnach= In Culhwch and Olwen Arthur's retinue also sail to Ireland (aboard his ship Prydwen, the ship used in Preiddeu) to obtain the cauldron which, like that in Preiddeu Annwfn, would never boil meat for a coward whereas it would boil quickly if meat for a brave man were put in it. Arthur's warrior Llenlleawc the Irishman seizes Caladvwch (Excalibur) and swings it around, killing Diwrnach's entire retinue. Taliesin is mentioned in Culhwch among Arthur's retinue, as are several Gweirs. Preiddeu Annwfn is usually understood to say that a sword described either as \\"bright\\" or else \\"of Lleawch\\" was raised to the cauldron, leaving it in the hands of \\"Lleminawc\\" (cledyf lluch lleawc idaw rydyrchit/ Ac yn llaw leminawc yd edewit). Some scholars have found the similarity to this Llenlleawc compelling, but the evidence is not conclusive. Higley suggests a common story has influenced these various Welsh and Irish accounts. =Annwfn= Sir John Rhys was quick to connect these campaigns in Ireland with the symbolic \\"western isles\\" of the Celtic otherworld and, in this general sense, Preiddeu Annfwn may be associated with the maritime adventure genres of Immram and Echtra. Rhys also noted that the Isle of Lundy was once known as Ynys Wair, and suggested that it was once accounted the place of Gweir's imprisonment. Culhwch also recounts Arthur's nearby rescue of another of the three famous prisoners, Mabon ap Modron, a god of poetry after whom the Mabinogi are named, and gives details of another ruler of Annwfn, Gwynn ap Nudd, king of the Tylwyth Teg - the fairies in Welsh lore - \\"whom God has placed over the brood of devils in Annwn lest they should destroy the present race\\". Gwynn is also made part of Arthur's retinue, though he is the son of a god, after Arthur intervenes in his dispute over Creiddylad. In the First Branch of the Mabinogi Pwyll marries Rhiannon and their son Pryderi receives a gift of pigs from Arawn. He later follows a white boar to a mysterious tower where he is trapped by a beautiful golden bowl in an enchanted \\"blanket of mist\\" and temporarily vanishes with Rhiannon and the tower itself. This motif has also been compared with that of Gweir/Gwair's imprisonment. Roger Sherman Loomis pointed out the similarities between Preiddeu's description of the \\"Glass Fortress\\" and a story from Irish mythology recorded in both the Book of Invasions and the 9th-century Historia Britonum, in which the Milesians, the ancestors to the Irish people, encounter a glass tower in the middle of the ocean whose inhabitants do not speak with them, just as, in Preiddeu, the Glass Fortress is defended by 6,000 men and Arthur's crew finds it difficult to speak with their sentinel. The Milesians attack and most of their force perishes. Another fortress, \\"Caer Sidi\\", is often linked through its name with the Irish fairyland, where live the Tuatha D√© Danann, whom the Milesians eventually conquer.Higley's notes it appears again in the same collection, in \\"Kerd Veib am Llyr\\", (\\"The Song of the Sons of Llyr\\"), in language that closely follows that of Preiddeu; Complete is my chair in Caer Siddi/ No one will be afflicted with disease or old age that may be in it./ Manawyddan and Pryderi know it./ Three (musical?) instruments by the fire, will sing before it/ and around its borders are the streams of the ocean/ and the fruitful fountain is above it.... The poet, this time definitely speaking as Taliesin, also claims to have been with Bran in Ireland, Bran and Manawyddan being the sons of Ll≈∑r. Higley affirms that Annwfn is \\"popularly associated with the land of the old gods who can bestow gifts, including the gift of poetry (awen)\\". She cites another poem in the same collection, called \\"Angar Kyfyndawt\\", which states that Annwfn is in the deeps below the earth, and that \\"It is Awen I sing, / from the deep I bring it\\". The great ox has \\"seven score links on his collar\\" while in \\"Angar Kyfyndawt\\" awen has \\"seven score ogyruen\\", though this latter is not a well- understood term. In a third poem, \\"Kadeir Teyrnon\\", three \\"awens\\" come from the ogyruen, just as in the birth legend Taliesin receives inspiration in three drops from the cauldron of Ceridwen, the enchantress who gives a second birth to the legendary Taliesin, and who is also mentioned other poems from the collection, \\"Kerd Veib am Llyr\\" and \\"Kadeir Kerrituen\\", and by another poet, Cuhelyn, in connection with ogyruen.Mary Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia These poems draw freely upon a wide variety of otherworldly tales, representing the fateful voyage, the battle, imprisonment and the cauldron as allegories of a mystical poetic knowledge beyond the ordinary. Robert Graves aligned himself personally with the poets' standpoint, commenting that literary scholars are psychologically incapable of interpreting mythInter alia ‚Äì The White Goddess, Farrar Straus Giroux, p. 224. =The Grail= Early translators suggested a link between Preiddeu Annwfn (taken together with the Bran story) and the later Grail narratives, with varying degrees of success. Similarities are sometimes peripheral, such as that both Bran the Blessed and the Grail keeper the Fisher King receive wounds in their legs and both dwell in a castle of delights where no time seems to pass. The graal portrayed in Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail is taken to be reminiscent of Bran's cauldron, and, as in Preiddeu, the Grail romances always result in initial tragedy and frequently in huge loss of life. Earlier scholars were quicker to read Celtic origins in the Holy Grail stories than their modern counterparts. Whereas early 20th-century Celtic enthusiast Jessie Weston unequivocally declared that an earlier form of the Grail narrative could be found in Preiddeu Annwfn, modern researcher Richard Barber denies Celtic myth had much influence on the legend's development at all.Barber, The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief. R. S. Loomis, however, argued that it was more logical to search for recurrent themes and imagery found in both the Grail stories and Celtic material rather than exact ancestors; many or most modern scholars share this opinion.

History The current Jinjiang Hotel was converted from three buildings: the 13-storey Cathay Mansion apartment building completed in 1929, the 18-storey Grosvenor House apartment building completed in 1934, and a three-storey side wing of Grosvenor House. Both buildings were owned by Victor Sassoon's E.D. Sassoon and Company Limited. By the time the Communist Party of China liberated Shanghai in 1949, many of the residents had fled the city. According to records, by the end of 1949, of Grosvenor House's 77 apartments, only 12 were inhabited: 10 by foreigner households, and two Chinese. The name \\"Jinjiang\\" derives from a restaurant opened in 1935 by female entrepreneur Dong Zhujun elsewhere in Shanghai. In 1951, the new government took over Cathay Mansion and converted it into a hotel for senior party officials and international visitors. Dong's restaurant moved into Cathay Mansion, the hotel was named \\"Jinjiang Hotel\\", and Dong became the hotel's first chairman. Grosvenor House remained an apartment building, but in 1956 was confiscated by the government. Some of the apartments were allocated to Shanghai's prominent literati. These same residents were denounced and \\"swept out\\" in 1957 during the Anti-Rightist Movement. The building was then allocated to Jinjiang Hotel as well. When President Nixon visited China, the American delegation stayed at this hotel, and the Shanghai Communiqu√© was signed there. Jinjiang Hotel was renovated in 1998. The separate Jin Jiang Tower hotel is a high-rise hotel built one block from the original Jinjiang Hotel. It was built in 1988. In March 2000, the Jinjiang Hotel was rated as a 5-star hotel rating by the National Tourism Bureau of China. The hotel was renovated in 2004. Overview The Jin Jiang Hotel (Jinjiang Fandian) is a garden hotel located in central Shanghai on Maoming Road near Huaihai Road's designer boutiques and retail outlets. Since its opening, the hotel has received about 300 state leaders and heads of government. The hotel is set amidst two gardens and three European-style buildings. The 515 guestrooms pair modern facilities including broadband Internet access and IPTV TVs with traditional furniture and decor. The Jin Jiang Hotel's restaurant dates back to the 1930s and the classic international and Asian cuisines that were popular then are still as excellent as ever. The hotel also has meeting facilities, including the Jin Jiang Grand Hall which can hold up to 504 people. A team of event planners and specialists are available, and the facility comes with modern equipment such as simultaneous interpretation systems and video conference systems. On the southern side of the Jin Jiang Grand Hall is the Jin Jiang Recreation Centre, comprising an indoor swimming pool and a fitness center. There is also a beauty salon and sauna. Awards and recognition As a representative of the state of \\"Chinese culinary artistry\\", the hotel's cuisine was highly praised by a New York Times reporter, proving that the China's cuisine is returning to its \\"glory days\\". The catering service department of Jinjiang Grand Hall gained the honor of ‚ÄúAdvanced Group of National Travel Industry‚Äù and made a speech as the only representative from Shanghai (a total of six were chosen in China) in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Use Torula, in its inactive form (usually labeled as torula yeast), is widely used as a flavoring in processed foods and pet foods.

It is pasteurized and spray-dried to produce a fine, light grayish-brown powder with a slightly yeasty odor and gentle, slightly meaty taste. Cyberlindnera jadinii (which in these contexts is often still labelled with its synonym Candida utilis) can be used, in a blend of various other yeasts, as secondary cheese starter culture \\"... to inoculate pasteurised milk, which mimic the natural yeast flora of raw milk and improve cheese flavour.

Synopsis The play consists of four parts, with a monologue making up each part. The monologues are given, in order, by Hardy himself; his wife, Grace; his manager, Teddy, and finally Hardy again. The monologues tell the story of Hardy, including an incident in a Welsh village in which he cures ten people. Teddy's monologue reveals that Grace dies by suicide, while Hardy ponders whether his gift is real or not. In his second monologue, it is suggested that he is killed near his home after being unable to heal a cripple. He says that he knows he will not be able to heal him and, going to face death, he feels a sense of homecoming. It is not made explicit however, that Hardy is actually killed; Friel leaves this to the reader's interpretation. Production history Faith Healer received its first performance on 23 February 1979 in Boston in a production by Jos√© Quintero, with James Mason, Clarissa Kaye and Donal Donnelly. It closed after twenty performances. The first production in Ireland was at the Abbey Theatre in August 1980, in a production by Joe Dowling starring Donal McCann, Kate Flynn and John Kavanagh. The first London production was at the Royal Court Theatre in March 1981, directed by Christopher Fettes, with Patrick Magee, Helen Mirren and Stephen Lewis. BBC Radio produced the play with Norman Rodway as Frank, June Tobin as Gracie and Warren Mitchell as Teddy. It was produced by Robert Cooper and broadcast on Radio 3 on 13 March 1980, with a repeat on 18 May 1980. It was revived in 1983 at the Vineyard Theatre, directed by Dann Florek, with J. T. Walsh, Kathleen Chalfant and Martin Shakar. In the same year, William Needles played the title role at the University of California, Irvine. Also in the cast were Mary Anne McGarry and Keith Fowler. The show was revived under the direction of Robert Cohen for a gala presentation to the UCI Theater Guild. Joe Dowling returned to the play in 1992 at the Royal Court Theatre, London, his production again starring Donal McCann, joined by Sin√©ad Cusack and Ron Cook to huge acclaim. The critic Sarah Compton remarked that it was \\"a version so potent that I can look back on it now in vivid, overwhelming detail\\". Two years later, the production opened at the Long Wharf Theatre, with McCann and Cook. Cusack was sadly unavailable and Judy Geeson took over. The New York Times called the production \\"incandescent\\" and recommended it to \\"any connoisseur of theater\\". It was revived in London in 2001 by the Almeida Theatre, in a production by Jonathan Kent. The cast consisted of Ken Stott, Geraldine James and Ian McDiarmid. McDiarmid won the 2001 Critics' Circle Best Actor Award for this role. Jonathan Kent revived the play again for the Gate Theatre in Dublin early in 2006, this time with Ralph Fiennes, Ingrid Craigie and Ian McDiarmid. This production opened on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on 4 May 2006, with Cherry Jones as Grace. On Broadway it received four Tony Award nominations and won the Best Featured Actor in a Play, Ian McDiarmid. The Gate Theatre revived the play again in 2009, presenting the play at the Sydney Festival as part of a trio of works being performed to honour the eightieth birthday of Friel. The other works were The Yalta Game and Afterplay. This production played at the Gate Theatre in Dublin in January 2010. In 2009, it was also staged by Eric Hill at the Unicorn Theatre as part of the Berkshire Theatre Festival in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, with Colin Lane, Kiera Naughton and David Atkins to unanimous acclaim. In October 2009, Joe Dowling directed the play yet again at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This time Dowling also took on the lead role of Frank Hardy himself. In February 2011, it was staged at Bristol Old Vic under the direction of associate director Simon Godwin. In June 2016, the play was revived at the Donmar Warehouse by director Lyndsey Turner, with the cast of Stephen Dillane, Gina McKee and Ron Cook, to exceptional reviews. On 22 October 2016, the play opened at Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney, Australia. Directed by Judy Davis with the cast of Colin Friels, Alison Whyte and Pip Miller. \\"This will go down as one of those nights when you feel that theatre has laid its hands on you.\\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/faith-healer-review- charismatic-colin-friels-leads-all-to-believe-in-power-of- theatre-20161027-gsc1j8.html An Abbey Theatre production, directed by Joe Dowling and designed by John Lee Beatty, and starring Aidan Gillen as Frank Hardy had been planned for early 2020 but was postponed due to Covid-19.

Established by Jacques Cartier in 1541, it was France's first attempt at a colony in North-America, and was abandoned two years later. History In the summer of 1541, after arriving on his third and final voyage, French explorer Jacques Cartier established the fort and a settlement of 400 people. It consisted of an upper fort, and lower fort located near the confluence of Rivi√®re du Cap Rouge at the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The upper fort, at an elevation of , offered a strategic defensive position, while the lower fort provided a potential anchorage for ships. The two forts had three towers. Charlesbourg Royal was named after Charles II, Duke of Orleans, third son of King Francis I of France. During the first winter, 35 of Cartier's men perished. Fort Charlesbourg Royal was abandoned in September 1543 due to the harsh weather, scurvy, and attacks from neighbouring Iroquoians of Stadacona and other villages. In August 2006, Quebec Premier Jean Charest and Canadian archaeologists under Yves Chretien announced the discovery of this long-lost settlement. Chretien identified its location from fragments of a decorated c.1540-1550 Italian style ceramic plate and six wood timber samples dated to the mid-16th century by a United States laboratory.

Francis Brown ( ‚Äì ) served as the president of Dartmouth College. He graduated from the college in 1805 and from 1806‚Äì1809 held a tutorship there. He also served as a pastor of the First Parish Congregational Church in Yarmouth, Maine. Brown was removed from his presidency at the college as part of the actions that resulted in the Dartmouth College case, but was reinstated following the 1819 decision in favor of the college. Biography Francis Brown was born in Chester, New Hampshire. A pastor from Yarmouth, Maine, he presided over Dartmouth College during the famous Supreme Court hearing of Trustees of Dartmouth College v. William H. Woodward or, as it is more commonly called, the Dartmouth College Case. The contest was a pivotal one for Dartmouth and for the newly independent nation. It tested the contract clause of the Constitution and arose from an 1816 controversy involving the legislature of the state of New Hampshire, which amended the 1769 charter granted to Eleazar Wheelock, making Dartmouth a public institution and changing its name to Dartmouth University. Under the leadership of President Brown, the Trustees resisted the effort, and the case for Dartmouth was argued by Daniel Webster before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1818. Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the historic decision in favor of Dartmouth College, thereby paving the way for all American private institutions to conduct their affairs in accordance with their charters and without interference from the state. In a letter following the proceedings, Justice Joseph Story explained \\"the vital importance to the well-being of society and the security of private rights of the principles on which the decision rested. Unless I am very much mistaken, these principles will be found to apply with an extensive reach to all the great concerns of the people and will check any undue encroachments on civil rights which the passions or the popular doctrines of the day may stimulate our State Legislatures to adopt.\\" While the outcome was a tremendous victory for Dartmouth, the turmoil of the four-year legal battle left the college in perilous financial condition and took its toll on the health of President Brown. His condition steadily deteriorating, the Trustees made provisions, in 1819, for \\"the senior professors...to perform all the public duties pertaining to the Office of President of the College\\" in the event of his disability. Francis Brown died in July 1820 at the age of 36. Personal life Brown was the son of Benjamin and Prudence Brown. He married Elizabeth Gilman (1776‚Äì1851), the eldest daughter of Tristram Gilman, whom he had succeeded as pastor in Yarmouth.

Bluecar in service for the Bluely scheme in Lyon. By early 2013 in France, the Bollor√© Group announced plans to launch a similar carsharing service in Lyon, and Bordeaux, but under a different brand name (Bluely in Lyon and Bluecub in Bordeaux) with no cost to the cities. Bollor√©'s proposal is to fund the entire infrastructure, install and provide the vehicles, and cover the costs of maintenance and repairs. After these two schemes are implemented, the company plans to launch similar systems abroad beginning with a city in Asia. The Bluely began service in October 2013 with an initial fleet of 130 vehicles and 51 parking and charging stations. The BlueCub, began operating in January 2014 with an initial fleet of 90 vehicles, 40 parking stations and 180 charging stations. In May 2014 in the US, the Bluecars were showcased to the public in Indianapolis for a public car-sharing program called BlueIndy. The carsharing service was opened to the public in September 2015. BlueIndy began with 25 charging stations and 50 all-electric Bluecars around the city at launch. The Bluecars operated by the BlueIndy service were adapted to meet American regulations from the French version.

The service in Los Angeles started as a program targetted at low-income people and achieved relative success in their pilot program. In 2019, BlueLA secured US$3 million to expand their services within the city. In Singapore, under a agreement with Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board, the aim of introducing the electric car program was to reduce the car population and also carbon emissions in the city-state. Within the first 3 weeks of operations, over 3000 members signed up for the BlueSG, with 5000 rentals completed. Autolib', BlueIndy and BlueCity ceased operations in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, citing failure to achieve scalability in the respective cities that they operated in. =Retail version= Bluecars at the Autolib' charging station near Palais Garnier. Leasing to individual and corporate customers began in October 2012 and is limited to the √éle-de-France area. The Bluecar is available at a rate of () per month, with a minimum contract for 3 months and a maximum of 20 months. The pricing includes insurance, charging in the Autolib' stations and parking. The retail version shares the same design and specification but has several differences with the vehicles deployed for Autolib, particularly its blue exterior color, unlike the Autolib' version's silver unpainted aluminum exterior. In February 2013, Bollor√© announced it was discontinuing the leasing program and began retail sales of the Bluecar starting at a price of () before the value added tax and the government bonus, plus a monthly fee of () for the batteries. Bollor√© also offers an optional package for the installation of a wall-box home charging station for (, and for an optional monthly fee of (), owners can have access to the Autolib' network of charging stations around Paris. Bluecar used by Atos MyCar corporate carsharing service in Bezons, France. =Atos MyCar= Atos and Bollor√© Group launched the MyCar corporate carsharing pilot program in December 2012. The service is dedicated to Atos employees for their business travel needs at the company's headquarters in Bezons, France. Atos employees can book a car on the Atos intranet, pick it up and drive away. Besides promoting a more sustainable way to travel for business, Atos also expects that the MyCar service will reduce time spent booking travel and taxis, as well as the need for expense claims for business kilometers traveled, taxis and parking. A fleet of ten Atos branded Bollor√© Bluecars were initially deployed, and photovoltaic panels covering 60m2 provide a power of 12 kW to charge the vehicles at the Bezons site. In addition, during their trips users can also access the 3,500 Autolib' charging stations available in Paris and its surrounding area. The carsharing service is part of Atos \\"Zero carbon\\" initiative that aims to reduce by 50% Atos carbon footprint by 2015. Fire incidents On October 14, 2013, a Bluecar burned down while parked and charging at an Autolib' carsharing kiosk in Paris and the fire then spread to a second Bluecar. A police investigation is looking into the cause of the fire. According to Bollor√©, the real-time telemetric monitoring system did not register a thermal runaway problem with the battery of the car where the fire started. The company is attributing the origin of the fire to an external cause, probably vandalism. Bollor√© reported that a total of 25 Bluecars in service for Autolib' have burnt during the previous two years, most of them certified as attributed to vandals.

There was often some distortion to fit things in - Manhattan was often broadened, and Brooklyn twisted around toward the northeast, but the maps preserved the broad facts of the geography. From 1958 to 1978, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) conducted a twenty-year experiment with diagrammatic subway maps, which showed the topology of the subway network but dispensed with most of the topographical detail, schematized the coastline, and abstracted the subway lines onto a grid. John Tauranac brought this experiment to an end in 1979. =The William Ronan era= The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was founded in 1968, and its first chairman, Dr William J. Ronan, sought to establish a modern brand image. Unimark International, in its New York office headed by Massimo Vignelli, gave him this through two things: * The wholesale replacement of the inconsistent and out-of-date subway signage by an elegant and efficient system, designed by Robert Noorda and Massimo Vignelli, which is still in use today.Paul Shaw & Katrin Klingan, \\"Helvetica and the New York City Subway System: The True (Maybe) Story\\", MIT Press, February 2011 * A diagrammatic map of the subway system, launched in 1972.New York Times, August 5, 1972, \\"New Subway Maps Introduced\\"Peter B. Lloyd, \\"Vignelli: Transit Maps\\", RIT Press, December 2012 =The David Yunich era= In 1974, Ronan was replaced as chairman by David Yunich, formerly Vice Chairman at Macy's department store.New York Times, April 27, 1974, \\"Ronan Leaves M.T.A with a Lot of Believers\\"New York Times, May 3, 1974, \\"Yunich Now M.T.A.'s Chief Motorman\\" Yunich brought an explicit focus on marketing the subway service, saying at his swearing-in that he would examine \\"any innovative marketing idea\\" and \\"Transit marketing is not too different from offering a new line in men's shirts or automobiles\\".New York Times, May 3, 1974, \\"Yunich Now M.T.A.'s Chief Motorman\\" He created a Marketing Department and appointed as its Director Claire McCarthy, who hired John Tauranac as contributing editor of a compendious volume \\"Seeing New York: The Official MTA Guide book\\" in time for the United States Bicentennial which brought an influx of visitors to New York.Memo from Claire McCarthy, September 8, 2006 The guidebook promoted the City of New York as a place to visit and enjoy, and promoted the subway as the means of getting around the city. Yunich also brought from Macy's his former colleague Fred Wilkinson (as Executive Officer for Passenger Services), who in 1975 formed the Subway Map Committee,Minutes of the Subway Map Committee, July 10, 1975 with the aim of designing a new subway map that would not simply tell riders how to get from one station to another - as the existing Vignelli map did, but would also promote the city and its subway, encouraging people to visit and explore it and to use the subway. =The new map style= Claire McCarthy and senior manager William Allison required that the subway map in the Guidebook be geographic, so that it could also show the locations of visitor attractions. This requirement coincided with Tauranac's own personal preference for geographic maps.John Tauranac, \\"The 1979 Subway Map: A Chronology of Events\\", v13, July 30, 2009 It was, however, impossible to draw all the routes in Manhattan as separate colored lines because of the lack of space. Tauranac, therefore, had the map drawn with all subway lines in red. Which services ran on any given lines were indicated by route bullets, which were circles with the names of routes, such as 1,2,3, ... A,B.C,... etc. When Tauranac was made a member of the Subway Map committee, around December 1975, he brought this geographic style of map with him. About four prototype maps were constructed during 1975Photographic slides in the possession of John Tauranac and tested on different demographic groups by Dr Arline Bronzaft and Michael Hertz.Newsday, May 12, 1975, Peter Unger, \\"A Map in Transit\\" =The Subway Map Committee= At the end of 1976, Wilkinson was assigned from Transit to be Executive Officer of Surface operations and stepped down from the Subway Map Committee.Minutes of the Subway Map Committee, December 17, 1976. For half a year, the committee did not meet; and then in the summer of 1977, Tauranac was assigned chair of the committee and meetings resumed.Minutes of Subway Map Committee, June 30, 1977 Further map experiments were made, and in February 1978 Tauranac organised an exhibition entitled \\"The Good, The Bad ... The Better? A New York City Subway Map Retrospective\\" at the Cityana Gallery run by Benjamin Blom, exhibiting the committee's latest prototype map and offering a questionnaire for testing public reaction.New York Times, February 9, 1978, Paul Goldberger, \\"Putting the Subways on a New Map\\" Visitors said they liked the geographic information but disliked the use of a single color for all subway lines.Minutes of Subway Map Committee, March 3, 1978. In response, Tauranac then prepared a version with two colors, blue for the former IRT lines and red for the former BMT and IND lines. This was exhibited at the Cooper Union in April, when Tauranac debated with Massimo Vignelli in a public battle between the two schools of map-making.The Times, May 8, 1978, Michael Leapman, column: \\"Leapman in America\\" In September 1978, Tauranac met with Phyllis Cerf Wagner, head of the MTA Aesthetics Committee, and told her that the map project was \\"dead in the water\\" because he could not make the map he wanted ‚Äî which was a trunk-colored scheme in which lines that diverge and converge retain the color of each trunk ‚Äî because there was no funding to change to signage to match the change in the map.Phyllis Cerf Wagner, interviewed by Barbaralee Diamonstein, September 1978, tapes held at Columbia University Cerf Wagner was able to secure the funds, and in June 1978 the finished subway map was published ‚Äî a geographic map with trunk-based colors ‚Äî in time for the Diamond Jubilee, the subway's 75-year anniversary. Tauranac led a committee of twelve people ‚Äî comprising TA staff and members of the public ‚Äî plus the three staff at Michael Hertz Associates.MTA Press Releases #86 and #87, June 24, 1979 Everybody contributed to the final design, and the map cannot be said to be designed by one individual.This statement is based on the existing minutes of the Subway Map Committee and interviews by Peter B. Lloyd with the traceable members of the committee, related MTA staff, and staff of Michael Hertz Associates The extant minutes of the Subway Map Committee show that Tauranac was responsible for several major design decisions - such as the use of a geographic style, the use of trunk-based color coding, the use of route markers, and the appearance of transfer stations. He also organised and coordinated the contributions of everybody in the group and liaised with TA and MTA staff to get approvals and funding and then to ensure that all the station and car signs in the subway network were changed to match the color scheme of the new map when it was launched in June 1979. He also defended the map in public debate with Massimo Vignelli in April 1978 and December 2010. Honors and awards To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the consolidation of New York City, Tauranac was named a Centennial Historian of the City of New York by the Mayor‚Äôs Office for his work in history. He serves on the advisory board of the Art Deco Society of New York and on the board of the Cornwall Connecticut Historical Society in Connecticut. Tauranac received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University‚Äôs School of General Studies, where he majored in English literature, and his graduate degree from New York University‚Äôs Graduate School of Arts and Science, where his area of study was American urban history. Personal life He lives on Manhattan‚Äôs Upper West Side with his wife and daughter.

It was originally thought to be the ancestor to the carnosaurian dinosaurs (such as Allosaurus). However, it is now known to be more closely related to crocodilians than to dinosaurs. Despite this relationship to crocodiles, Ornithosuchus was able to walk on its hind legs, like many dinosaurs. However, it probably spent most of its time on all fours, only moving bipedally when it needed to run rapidly. Its skull also resembled those of theropod dinosaurs, but more primitive features included the presence of five toes on each foot and a double row of armoured plates along the animal's back. Ornithosuchus has traditionally been estimated at a length of about around .  Classification  Ornithosuchus and Hyperodapedon. A single species of Ornithosuchus is recognized, O. woodwardi.

The genus name Dasygnathus had already been used for a coleopteran insect, so Huxley's generic name was in 1961 changed to Dasygnathoides. Although synonymized with Ornithosuchus by Walker (1964), a 2016 study found Dasygnathoides indeterminate beyond Pseudosuchia. The maximal length of Ornithosuchus was revised to 2.2 metres. Ornithosuchus is the type genus of the Ornithosuchidae, a family of facultatively biped carnivores that were geographically widespread during the Late Triassic. Two other genera are currently known, Venaticosuchus and Riojasuchus. References Sources * Walker, A.D.

The Bakassi Boys are usually armed with machetes and guns and an array of black magic artifacts and Juju worn around their body. They operate in the Igbo area of Nigeria and have been accused of extrajudicial killings of suspected petty thieves, armed robbers, ritual killers, murderers, corrupt persons, and generally anyone they considered evil. The manner in which they knew or discovered if one was evil or not was by the use of dark magic in which they placed a magical silver-colored machete on the chest of any suspicious person, and if the machete's color changed from silver to blood red it meant the person had committed a heinous crime at some point in their life, and invariably such a person would be killed immediately. In the south- eastern part of Nigeria, especially Anambra State, they still enjoy popular support in the areas where they operate because the vices in the region have been greatly reduced since the inception of the vigilante group in 1998. According to publications by various Nigerian media houses, their greatest metaphysical power was their ability to be immune to gunshot wounds, even when shot multiple times at close range, they wouldn't flinch nor sustain any injuries. This metaphysical power was referred to as Odeshi amongst the Igbo people of Nigeria. Odeshi is an Igbo word that means \\"It does not leak\\" or \\"it would not leak\\", which meant if anyone shot them with a gun it wouldn't pierce their skins hence their blood would not leak. The Bakassi Boys have since 2004 rebranded as Anambra Vigilante Services (AVS), Imo Vigilante Services (IVS) and Abia Vigilante Services (AVS) and have had their activities reduced significantly. History These groups likely took their name from the Bakassi peninsula, an oil-rich peninsula in the Annang-Efik-Ibibio region of the coastal south-eastern Nigeria, disputes over which had hastened hostilities between Nigeria and Cameroon, with both countries contending for ownership of the region and its resources. The Boys emerged as a vigilante group simultaneous with sharp increases in the crime rate of Abia State. They originally enjoyed the support of the governor, Orji Uzor Kalu. He sensed the effectiveness of the group in combating the crimes in Aba and environs. However, as the crime rate was going down in Aba, other eastern Igbo cities were not so lucky, and the crime rate in places like Onitsha was still rising. The Boys then were invited to other major cities, like Onitsha and Owerri, to rid them of criminals. In time, law enforcement agencies became regarded as ineffectual symbols and the Bakassi endeared themselves to many Igbo traders and merchants. However, political opponents of some governors accused the group of extrajudicial killings and accused governors of using the Boys as weapons of intimidation. As a result of heightened opposition, the group has attempted to rebrand itself Anambra State Vigilante Services. In media A film titled Issakaba, an anagram for Bakassi, was produced in the year 2000 by Lancelot Oduwa Imasuen, and it depicted the origin of the vigilante group and their encounter with Eddy Nawgu.

The Action Office system was designed to promote productivity, privacy, and health (they attempted to increase blood flow) at the expense of some inefficient use of space. Cubicles are now typically designed to maximize efficient use of space. The efficient \\"cubicle\\" became popular in office design because of the movable wall seen in the Action Office II (AO2) system, which initially saved money in construction and development costs. After their introduction into the marketplace, the Action Office II and other office systems were modified to pack in as many employees as possible into an office space .

Life Probably born before 1160, he was the fifth son of Robert V de B√©thune, hereditary Lord of B√©thune and Advocate of the Abbey of Saint-Vaast at Arras in today's Pas-de-Calais, who died on the Third Crusade at the siege of Acre in 1191, and his wife Alice, daughter of Hugues III, Count of Saint-Pol. His four elder brothers were: :Robert VI de B√©thune, who succeeded his father as Lord of B√©thune and Advocate of Arras; :Guillaume II de B√©thune, who succeeded his brother as Lord of B√©thune and Advocate of Arras; :Baudouin de B√©thune, Count of Aumale and companion of King Richard I of England; and : Jean de B√©thune, Bishop and secular ruler of Cambrai. Conon was educated by his cousin, the noted poet Hugues III d'Oisy, Castellan of Cambrai, who taught him the art of poetry. It is probable, from comments made in one of his poems, that Conon appeared before the French court at the occasion of the marriage of King Philippe Auguste with Isabelle of Hainaut in 1180 and sang his songs before Marie de Champagne, noted for her connection to the poet Chr√©tien de Troyes. He was however embarrassed, as he recorded wryly in the poem Mout me semont Amors ke je m'envoise, by his Artesian accent.Axel Wallensk√∂ld (1921), Les Chansons de Conon de B√©thune, Paris, Honor√© Champion, https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Chansons_de_Conon_de_B%C3%A9thune, song III, lines 4-15 After having taken part in the Third Crusade to Palestine, Conon de B√©thune went with his brother Guillaume on the Fourth Crusade in 1203, accompanying the knights of Baldwin, Count of Flanders and Hainaut. At the outset he was chosen as one of six knights to command all transport and supplies and when the army arrived at Constantinople he was appointed its spokesman in negotiations with the Byzantines. His rhetorical ability, wisdom and chivalry were praised by fellow Crusader Geoffroi de Villehardouin, who said of Conon: Bon chevalier et sage estoit et bien eloquens (A good knight and a wise one he was, and most eloquent). After the diverted Crusade's capture of Constantinople in 1204, Conon held a number of important positions in the Latin Empire under Baldwin (now emperor Baldwin I), the successor to the Byzantine Empire established by the Crusaders and centered on Constantinople. Awarded the senior title of protovestiarius, inherited from the Byzantine court, sometime in 1205,Van Tricht (2011), pp. 173‚Äì174 he played a key role in Baldwin's reconciliation with Boniface of Montferrat before the Battle of Adrianople against the Bulgarians, in which Baldwin was captured and later put to death.Shawcross (2012), pp. 195‚Äì196 In 1209, he supervised the signing of the Treaty of Sapienza on the emperor's behalf.Van Tricht (2011), p. 164 Conon then served Baldwin's brother emperor Henry of Flanders until his death in 1217, followed by Baldwin's sister Yolanda of Flanders, during which time he defended the city of Adrianople and was raised to the higher rank of sevastokrator. On the death of Yolanda in 1219, her son Robert of Courtenay became emperor but was far away in France. In his absence, the barons of the Empire elected Conon to serve as regent (baiulus) but he died shortly after. Landholdings He had various lands in France, as seigneur or as tenant. He was seigneur of Bergues near Dunkirk in 1202 and also of two villages (Rulliacum and Camissiacum) where in that year he freed the inhabitants, almost certainly to raise funds for crusading. These holdings he left in the charge of his nephew, Robert VII, Lord of B√©thune while he was away. Family Though the name of his wife is unknown, a son is recorded: Conon de B√©thune, called The Strong, who was alive in 1238. Another possible son, or nephew, Baldwin of B√©thune, succeeded Theodore Branas as Lord of Adrianople; as the lordship was hereditary it is assumed that Baldwin married an otherwise unattested daughter of Branas.Van Tricht, (2014) p. 334-335 Baldwin also held the court title of Caesar, likewise adopted from Byzantine practice.Van Tricht (2011), p. 177 Poetry Only 14 works of poetry attributed to Conon de B√©thune have survived; one of these, only attributed in Trouv√®re MS C (Bern 389) is a jeu-parti in which Conon is neither of the named participants. A total of 17 manuscripts contain at least one of the remaining thirteen attributed works, but three of these have alternative attributions in more reliable sources, resulting in an accepted number of 10 songs. Conon's poetry was written to be sung and many of his poems survive with musical notation. The majority of his poems are courtly love songs, but two of them are chansons de croisade or crusade songs in which the poet-lover deplores his approaching departure from his beloved but nevertheless accepts the \\"noble calling\\" of crusader. Conon de B√©thune also shows himself at times to be ironic or satirical, and in one of his crusade poems he rails with vehemence against financial abuses by those collecting funds for the crusaders. Some think he married Anne of Paris after composing a poem for her. The ten works edited by Wallensk√∂ld (1968) as authentically by Conon are: Chan√ßon legiere a entendre Si voiremant con cele don je chant Mout me semont Amors que je m'envoise Ahi!

Issues that become securitized do not necessarily represent issues that are essential to the objective survival of a state, but rather represent issues where someone was successful in constructing an issue into an existential problem. Securitization theorists assert that successfully securitized subjects receive disproportionate amounts of attention and resources compared to unsuccessfully securitized subjects causing more human damage. A common example used by theorists is how terrorism is a top priority in security discussions, even though people are much more likely to be killed by automobiles or preventable diseases than from terrorism. Securitization studies aims to understand \\"who securitizes (securitizing actor), on what issues (threats), for whom (referent object), why, with what results, and not least, under what conditions.\\"Barry Buzan, Ole W√¶ver, and Jaap de Wilde, Security: A New Framework for Analysis (Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998), p. 32. Origin Within international relations, the concept is connected with the Copenhagen School and is seen as a synthesis of constructivist and classical political realism in its approach.Michael C. Williams, Words, Images, Enemies, Securitization and International Politics, International Studies Quarterly 2003(47):512. The term was coined by Ole W√¶ver in 1993, but seems to have become commonplace, at least within constructivist studies of international relations. Definition Securitization is a process-oriented conception of security, which stands in contrast to materialist approaches of classical security studies. Classical approaches of security focus on the material dispositions of the threat including distribution of power, military capabilities, and polarity, whereas securitization examines how a certain issue is transformed by an actor into a matter of security in order to allow for the use of extraordinary measures. Moreover, the securitization act, to be successful, must be accepted by the audience, regardless of the subject matter being a real threat. As Thierry Braspenning-Balzacq puts it: \\"securitization is a rule-governed practice, the success of which does not necessarily depend on the existence of a real threat, but on the discursive ability to effectively endow a development with such a specific complexion\\". The audience may take several forms including technical, bureaucratic, public, and policymaking, and different audiences can perform different functions by accepting a securitization, as has been explored by Roe. As a process All securitization acts involve four components: * A securitizing actor/agent: an entity that makes the securitizing move/statement; * An existential threat: an object (or ideal) that has been identified as potentially harmful; * A referent object: an object (or ideal) that is being threatened and needs to be protected; * An audience: the target of the securitization act that needs to be persuaded and accept the issue as a security threat. That a given subject is securitized does not necessarily mean that the subject is of objective essence for the survival of a given state, but means merely that someone has successfully constructed something as an existential problem. However, Uriel Abulof argues that empirical studies on securitization have been \\"insufficiently attentive to societies engulfed in profound existential uncertainty about their own survival.\\" Taking Israel's \\"demographic demon\\" as a case in point, Abulof suggests that such societies are immersed in \\"deep securitization\\", whereby \\"widespread public discourses explicitly frame threats as probable, protracted, and endangering the very existence of the nation/state.\\" Principally, anyone can succeed in constructing something as a security problem through speech acts. The ability to effectively securitize a given subject is, however, highly dependent on both the status of a given actor and whether similar issues are generally perceived to be security threats. Effects on society Securitization theorists argue that a subject that has been successfully securitized will receive disproportionate attention and resources in comparison with subjects that have not been securitized, even when these other subjects actually cause more harm. > traffic incidents cause on average 150,000 fatalities a year in 56 states > ... people tend to accept this as a mere fact and do not securitize this by > demanding extraordinary measures.

If a subject is successfully securitized, then it is possible to legitimize extraordinary means to solve a perceived problem. This could include declaring a state of emergency or martial law, mobilizing the military or attacking another country. Furthermore, if something is successfully labelled as a security problem, then the subject can be considered to be an illegitimate subject for political or academic debate. According to an overview of the field by Roe, securitization theorists tend to treat securitization as a negative process that undermines democratic processes and diminishes necessary scrutiny that would otherwise be focused on political elites. Affected sectors In Security: A New Framework for Analysis, Barry Buzan, Ole W√¶ver, and Jaap de Wilde work with five political sectors in which a securitization could take place: * Military * Political * Economic * Society * Environment However, a securitization could easily involve more than one of these sectors. In the case of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, one could say that the conflict was securitized militarily; weapons of mass destruction was one reason for the invasion. However, the war was also securitized as a societal problem; human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq was mentioned in the public rationale. Another example for securitized sectors are immigrationThomas Faist. 2005. ‚ÄúThe Migration-Security Nexus: International Migration and Security.‚Äù In: Migration, Citizenship and Ethnos: Incorporation Regimes in Germany, Western Europe and North America, edited by Y.

Because it is easier to securitize an issue following the September 11 attacks, this concern for safety and security has taken attention away from the economic factors that have always been at play in international migration. In addition, also in migrants' countries of origin, diaspora, emigration, and citizenship issues can be securitized.Daniel Naujoks. 2015. ‚ÄúThe securitization of dual citizenship. National security concerns and the making of the Overseas Citizenship of India.‚Äù Diaspora Studies 8 (1), pp. 18‚Äì36. As a tactic Since securitized subjects can receive a disproportionate amount of attention and resources compared to unsuccessfully securitized subjects, some political strategists suggest that existing public policy issues can find more clout and attention among the public if advocates on these subjects succeed in securitizing them. For example, theorists suggest that advocates of space exploration could achieve more success by convincing state actors of the merits of their proposals around the rubric of security rather than science: that space exploration could be framed around how it protects humanity from looming existential threats such as meteorites, rather than around how it helps advance scientific knowledge. The existential threat of Climate change is another example of an issue that is increasingly becoming securitized. Criticism and responses Securitization as a \\"school\\" of international relations has been criticized for its lack of practical usefulness. Unlike other schools of international relations, such as liberalism or realism, which can provide a framework or basis for understanding how to conduct international diplomacy, securitization has been criticized for being a theory that is more akin to an interesting observation, rather than a theory which can be used in practical ways by political actors. Critics argue that pointing out the irrationality of a successfully securitized issue does little to change its political dynamics because as long as an issue remains successfully securitized, political actors will still be compelled to deal with it in the ways that its securitization demands.

This allows a very aerodynamic shape to the fuselage and very high useful loads (almost equal to the weight of the aircraft itself). One reviewer of the CT2K writing COPA Flight in October 2004 described the aircraft as \\"fast, comfortable, roomy and very capable of long cross country flights for little money\\" and faulted the aircraft only for its difficulty slowing down from its cruise speed of 130 knots to its final approach speed of 50 knots, requiring careful planning to lose 80 knots between entering the circuit and stabilizing the aircraft on final approach. Although the standard and required equipment varies by country, the CTSW has a standard Ballistic Recovery Systems parachute for the airframe. The BRS can be used to lower the entire aircraft to the ground in a controlled descent in the event of major structural failure, incapacitation of the pilot, or engine failure over mountainous terrain. =Regulatory categories= The aircraft can be flown under the microlight/ultralight regulations of several countries as well as the USA FAA Light-sport Aircraft rules, Canadian advanced ultralight and the European EASA Permit to Fly rules.

He was the only Iranian Bah√° º√≠ teacher who was given the chance to meet face to face with a Qajar Shah. He was later identified as one of the nineteen Apostles of Bah√° ºu'll√°h.  Background  M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d came from a remote village in Khurasan named D√∫gh√°b√°d. His father was Mull√° M√≠rz√° Muhammad, one of the few survivors of the battle of fort Tabarsi, who was an influential Shi ªa divine prior to becoming a B√°b√≠. Mull√° M√≠rz√° Muhammad, who had never before used a weapon, was wounded five times by bullets or swords; but in the end he survived and made his way back home, where he faced persecution for his new faith. Mull√° M√≠rz√° Muhammad was taken in chains to MasÕühhad, and after a long interim in the prison was released again, only to become a devoted follower of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. He travelled often to Ishqabad with his son M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d, where many persecuted Bah√° º√≠s settled. In Ishqabad, M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d became a well known teacher of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, often dedicating himself to the welfare of the youth. One biographer described his time there: :\\"He was never impatient, never autocratic. Kind and considerate, he led the youth gently to better manners, better understanding, better conduct. And he was exceedingly modest.\\" ::(Eminent Bah√° º√≠s, pg. 160)  Travels  The Islamic divines of D√∫gh√°b√°d caused the governor of the district to have M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d arrested for being a Bah√° º√≠. He was sent in chains to MasÕühhad. From his prison-cell, he managed to secretly send a letter to Nasiri'd-Din Shah, who issued an order for the release of M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d. The clerics of MasÕühhad managed to have him exiled, rather than set free, to a remote corner of Khorasan named Kal√°t. In Kal√°t, the governor soon became good friends with M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d, and informed him of the death of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. In his grief, M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d began a three-day fast. On the fourth night, Bah√° ºu'll√°h appeared to him in a dream, which he claimed gave him new life. He then travelled to Haifa and Akka in Palestine where he met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and then to Cairo where he met M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl. He then returned to Tehran where he met face to face with the Qajar prince, Kamran M√≠rza, son of Nasser al-Din Shah and brother to Mozzafar al-Din Shah. He then travelled to Ashgabat, to Haifa where he met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° again, and then back to Iran. After once again travelling to Haifa and returning to Iran, where he was severely beaten in a mob attack he met with the Shah of Iran Mozzafar al-Din Shah Qajar. His later travels included times in Yazd, Khorasan, his home town of D√∫gh√°b√°d, Ashgabat, Mashad, where he survived a murder attempt, Ashgabat, Egypt, Haifa, Mashad, and then D√∫gh√°b√°d.

Scan online at Today, it remains a landmark building in Sydney and is regarded as iconic to Australian architecture. It has even been described as the most beautiful building in Australia, though it is not without criticism. The outstanding feature of the Square is the Tower Building; from its completion in 1967 until 1976 was the tallest building in Sydney. Australia Square is jointly owned by the GPT Group and Dexus. During the mid-1990s the building was completely refurbished. Another $11 million refurbishment program, which included replacing all paving in public areas with Italian porphyry paving stone, new lighting and outdoor tables was conducted in 2003. The Tower Tower with Calder sculpture =Design= Australia Square was constructed shortly after height restrictions were lifted in the city of Sydney and at a time when small sites, including blocks created by laneways, were being consolidated into larger blocks to accommodate high-rise office towers. It was the world's tallest lightweight concrete building at the time it was built. The Tower Building is approximately tall and occupies only one quarter of the block. The circular plan of the main tower allowed Seidler to minimise what he called \\"the dark canyon effect\\", an approach further helped by setting the tower back from the street. The original proposal included 58 floors; however, this was reduced to 50. On the 47th floor is a revolving restaurant called The Summit and the 48th floor houses an observation deck. The building contains one of Sydney's largest basement car parks with spaces for 400 vehicles. The major tenants of the Tower include Origin Energy, HWL Ebsworth and ninemsn. With a height of , Australia Square also holds the distinction of being Australia's first modern \\"skyscraper\\" (a building which exceeds the height of ) as designated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. =Construction= Original ceiling, level 11 The project was instigated by Dick Dusseldorp, the founder of Lend Lease. The city block which is now Australia Square is approximately in area, and formerly held some 30 properties and buildings. Australia Square was constructed by Civil & Civic. Construction, starting with demolition of the old buildings, began in 1961. The finished tower is 50 storeys tall with most of these available for commercial tenants, a total of . The tower is constructed of lightweight concrete, with 20 projecting vertical columns tapering to the summit and supporting a combination of interlocking rib- structured reinforcement and radial support beams. The tower is in diameter, with a central core of diameter. The core contains elevator shafts, emergency stairwells and service conduits. Each floor is donut shaped, with a clear span of to the perimeter windows and a total area of each. Construction time for each floor was five working days‚Äîa new standard in office tower construction. Other features Facing Pitt Street is the 13-storey Plaza Building, a comparatively simple rectangular office building (designed 1961, construction started 1962,Mary Murphy, Challenges of Change: The Lend Lease Story (Lend Lease, Sydney 1984) page 84 completed 1964). The Plaza Building was devised to be completed and generate rental income while the round tower was being constructed. Alongside the Tower Building sits a large abstract steel sculpture by Alexander Calder. There is also a sculpture by Seward Johnson Jr, Waiting. The tower ground floor lobby had tapestries by Le Corbusier and Victor Vasarely on display; however, due to fading, those pieces were removed and replaced in 2003 with a mural by Sol LeWitt. The former Lend Lease executive floor in the tower also had many artworks specified by Harry Seidler: the reception area displayed a sculpture by Norman Carlberg and tapestries by John Olsen and Le Corbusier, the executive floor suites also had a tapestry by Miro and artwork by Alexander Calder.Two Towers (Harry Seidler Australia Square MLC Centre) by Philip Drew (Horwitz, Sydney; Karl Karemer Stuttgart, 1980) Page 52 Extensive public open space, including fountains, is a feature of the Square. This design feature is an early example of including a public open space on private land. There are numerous entrances to the retail precincts in the lower ground level of the Tower, which include a post office and food outlets. The retail target is the office worker on a lunch break, and the open-plan design and ease of access have been styled accordingly.

Early life Wagner was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to Morton Wagner and Bernice Maletz. When he was four, his family moved to San Francisco, then to Los Angeles four years later. His father was a radio station executive who eventually moved into television, producing The Les Crane Show, before becoming a stock broker. When his parents divorced, his mother worked at Saks Fifth Avenue, where she remained for 40 years. He attended Beverly Vista Elementary School in Beverly Hills, California, until the 8th grade. He attended Beverly Hills High School but dropped out in his junior year. He worked in bookstores, drove an ambulance for Schaefer Ambulance Service, and became a chauffeur at the Beverly Hills Hotel. He has two older sisters. Career In his twenties, Wagner began writing articles for magazines and writing scripts. His first screenplay, Young Lust, was produced by Robert Stigwood but was never released. It was that experience that ultimately led him to write his modern take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Pat Hobby\\" short stories about an alcoholic screenwriter who never gets ahead. Wagner self-published (with Caldecott Chubb) Force Majeure: The Bud Wiggins Stories in an edition of 1,000, which sold out at West Hollywood's Book Soup. It was optioned by Oliver Stone to direct but the project never came to fruition. (Wagner has said that the script he wrote, based upon the stories' protagonist - a chauffeur named Bud Wiggins - later became Maps to the Stars, the 2015 film directed by David Cronenberg.) The book was well reviewed and led to a publishing deal with Random House. He is currently published by Blue Rider Press, an imprint at Penguin Random House. He has written essays and op- ed pieces for publications including The New Yorker, The New York Times, Art Forum and Vanity Fair. His novel I'm Losing You was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, and his novel The Chrysanthemum Palace was a PEN/Faulkner finalist in 2006. He has also written essays and prefaces for books by photographers William Eggleston and Manuel Alvarez Bravo, and painters Ed Ruscha and Richard Prince. Wes Craven read an unproduced script of Wagner's (\\"They Sleep By Night\\"), which led Craven to ask Wagner to co-write A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987). Wagner and Craven wrote the story and share screenwriting credit with Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont. Wagner and Oliver Stone co-executive produced Wild Palms, the mini-series Wagner created, based on a comic strip that he wrote for Details magazine. Wild Palms aired on ABC in 1993. He was the executive producer and co-writer (with Tracey Ullman) of Tracey Ullman's State of the Union series (2008 - 2010) on Showtime. In 2014, David Cronenberg directed Wagner's script, Maps To The Stars, a film that Cronenberg had been trying to make for a decade. For her role as Havana Segrand, Julianne Moore won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival in 2014. Wagner accepted the award on her behalf. Personal life Wagner married actress Rebecca De Mornay on December 16, 1986, and the couple divorced in 1990. He married Laura Peterson in 2009. Mysticism After interviewing Carlos Castaneda for Details magazine in 1994,\\"You Only Live Twice\\" , Details magazine, March 1994; from FourYogas.com Wagner became part of Castaneda's inner circle under the assumed name of Lorenzo Drake. He directed the first videos on Tensegrity for Cleargreen and married the mystic Carol Tiggs in 1995. Wagner continues to be close to the group since Castaneda's death in 1998. His first autobiographical piece about his experience with the shaman and author Castaneda appeared in the Fall 2007 issue of Tricycle magazine. After Wagner's novel Memorial was favorably reviewed in that magazine by a Buddhist monk, Wagner wrote its editor, James Shaheen, a letter of thanks, and Shaheen invited him to contribute an essay about Castaneda. Wagner and two partners own the television and film rights to all of Castaneda's books. More recently, Wagner studied with Indian guru Ramesh Balsekar.\\"Hollywood Satiricon\\", LA Weekly, 27 January 2005 Novels * Force Majeure (1991) * Wild Palms (1993) (graphic novel) * I'm Losing You (1996) * I'll Let You Go (2002) * Still Holding (2003) * The Chrysanthemum Palace (2005) * Memorial (2006) * Dead Stars (2012) * The Empty Chair (2014) * I Met Someone (2016) * A Guide For Murdered Children (writing as Sarah Sparrow) (2018) * The Marvel Universe: Origin Stories (2020) Screenplays * A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), \\"story by\\" credit, shared with Wes Craven * Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989) * Wild Palms (1993) * White Dwarf (1995) * I'm Losing You (1998), also director * Women in Film (2001), also director * Maps to the Stars (2014) Acting *Knight of Cups (2015) as Bud Wiggins *Maps to the Stars (2014) as Benjie's Chauffeur (uncredited) *Night Visions (1990) (TV Movie) as Agent *Shocker (1989) as Executioner *Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989) as Dinner Guest *How I Got Into College (1989) as A *I, Madman (1989) as Pianist *Mortuary Academy (1988) as Schuyler *Stranded (1987) as Reporter *The New Adventures of Beans Baxter (TV Series) as Vlodia (4 episodes) *One Crazy Summer (1986) as Uncle Frank *Head Office (1985) as Al Kennedy References External links Spike Magazine interview * The Art of Reality in Tricycle 1954 births 20th-century American novelists 21st-century American novelists American male novelists Living people Writers from Madison, Wisconsin PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction winners Novelists from Wisconsin Film directors from Wisconsin ","title":"Bruce Wagner"},{"id":"4336655","text":"Gornji Tavankut is a village located in the Subotica municipality, in the North Baƒçka District of Serbia.

Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U.S. 280 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court clarified the Rooker- Feldman doctrine and its relation to preclusion and concurrent jurisdiction.  Background  In 1980, two subsidiaries of Exxon Mobil Corporation (the plaintiff and petitioner in this matter) formed a joint venture with defendant/respondent Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC). Twenty years later, a dispute arose over royalties SABIC had charged Exxon Mobil's subsidiaries for sublicenses to a polyethylene manufacturing method, and SABIC sued the two subsidiaries in Delaware Superior Court in July 2000. Instead of first filing a counterclaim in the Delaware state court system, Exxon Mobil and its subsidiaries chose to sue SABIC in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. There, they alleged that SABIC had overcharged the subsidiaries for the sublicenses. Exxon Mobil claimed subject-matter jurisdiction in federal court under , which gives the United States district courts jurisdiction over foreign states. In January 2002, Exxon Mobil filed an answer to SABIC's complaint in the Delaware state court, asserting the same counterclaims that they had filed in federal court. Meanwhile, SABIC moved to dismiss the federal suit. The district court denied the motion. The state suit reached trial first, and the jury returned a huge verdict for Exxon Mobil, totalling over $400 million. SABIC then appealed the judgment to the Delaware Supreme Court. SABIC also filed an interlocutory appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit of the denial of their motion to dismiss the federal suit. The Third Circuit raised, sua sponte (on its own motion), the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction, and concluded that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine precluded the district court from proceeding, on the grounds that Exxon Mobil's claims had already been heard in state court--even though Exxon Mobil was not seeking to have the state court verdict overturned. = Issue = The main issue in this case was whether the Rooker-Feldman doctrine overrides the preclusion doctrine (see res judicata) or concurrent jurisdiction of the state & federal courts.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Ginsburg, writing for a unanimous Court, reversed the Third Circuit's decision and remanded the case. She began her decision with a fairly concise retelling of the holdings in both the Rooker and Feldman cases. She then held that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine > is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: > cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state- > court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and > inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments. Rooker- > Feldman does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or > augment the circumscribed doctrines that allow federal courts to stay or > dismiss proceedings in deference to state-court actions. 125 S.Ct. at 1521-1522. This essentially had the effect of cabining the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and limiting its application, defining it as separate and distinct from both preclusion and abstention doctrine. Furthermore, Ginsburg went on to explain that parallel litigation in both state and federal courts does not automatically trigger Rooker-Feldman, and that federal courts must give state court judgments preclusive effect under the Full Faith and Credit Act, .

Renowned for her raspy vocals and emotional delivery, she has sold millions of records and is recognized as one of the biggest Serbian singers of all time. Born in Prokuplje and raised in the village of ≈Ωitoraƒëa, Ceca emerged as a teen star upon her debut album Cvetak zanovetak in 1988, receiving the song of the year award at the Ilid≈æa Folk Music Festival. During the 1990s, she saw more significant popularity by collaborating with lyricist Marina Tucakoviƒá on hit- songs such as \\"Kukavica\\" (Coward) and \\"Beograd\\" (Belgrade). Following successful albums Ceca 2000 (1999) and Decenija (2001), in June 2002 she held a concert at Belgrade's Stadion Marakana for around 70,000 people. In June 2006 and 2013, Ceca has also performed at Belgrade's U≈°ƒáe in front of more than 100,000 fans. Furthermore at the age of seventeen, she starred as Ko≈°tana in the film adaptation of Borisav Stankoviƒá's novel Impure Blood, which was eventually cut out upon its release in 1996 due to poor critical reception. Ceca was also a judge on the RTV Pink's singing competition Pinkove Zvezde between 2014 and 2016. She has two children with career criminal and commander in the Yugoslav Wars, ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá Arkan, who was assassinated in January 2000. Despite her popularity and success, Ceca has been known as the subject of controversies. During the Operation Sabre, she was arrested for illegal firearm possession. In 2011, Ra≈ænatoviƒá was also charged for embezzlement and sentenced with ‚Ç¨1,5 million fine and to a year in house arrest. Other ventures =Politics= Ceca was appointed the honorary president of the Party of Serbian Unity (SSJ) formed by her late husband, ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá (Arkan). She has not been politically active and claims to have only accepted the position in honor of her deceased husband. After clashing with the president of the party, Borislav Peleviƒá, on many issues, Ceca withdrew herself from politics completely. On the night of 17 March 2004, Ceca and Kristijan Goluboviƒá (close associate of Arkan) gathered demonstrators in front of the Government building in Belgrade to speak about the situation in Kosovo and the burning of more than 300 Serbian Orthodox churches in Kosovo. =Charity= Ceca is the president of the \\"Third Child\\" humanitarian fund. Her organizations prime goal is to increase the birthrate in Serbia and to help families who already have three or more children. She has held several humanitarian concerts raising money for food, clothing, and sundries to benefit the Serbs in Kosovo, after the unrest in Kosovo in March 2004. Private life =Marriage and motherhood = While performing for the Serb Volunteer Guard (SDG), a paramilitary force also known as Arkan's Tigers, in Erdut on 11 October 1993 during the Croatian War of Independence, she met her future husband, ≈Ωeljko \\"Arkan\\" Ra≈ænatoviƒá, the unit commander and a career criminal, through pop singer Oliver Mandiƒá. When the Party of Serbian Unity (SSJ) was formed, she was asked by Arkan to perform. He was married at the time, and the divorce that ended that marriage was finalized two months before their wedding. Arkan proposed to Ceca on 7 January 1995 and they married a month later, on 19 February. Ceca's parents were initially against the marriage. Their wedding was broadcast on television, made headlines in newspapers, and was portrayed by Serbian media as a \\"Serbian fairytale\\". They had two children, a son, Veljko, in 1996 and daughter, Anastasija, in 1998. Arkan was shot on 15 January 2000 in a Belgrade hotel by four gunmen. Despite having been shot in the head, he remained alive for a brief period of time, but died in Ceca's arms in the backseat of the car that was taking them to the emergency room. After fifteen months of mourning, she made her first public appearance in April 2001 in a television interview. =Legal issues= When the Serbian reformist Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá was assassinated on 12 March 2003, prompting Serbian authorities to launch Operation Sabre. Ceca's Belgrade home was raided as part of the crackdown on the network of criminals and nationalists behind the assassination. The raid led to a thorough investigation. She was arrested on 17 March 2003 and charged with illegal possession of multiple firearms. Ceca was one of dozens of people detained in the crackdown and she spent three months in prison. She claimed the firearms were brought to the house by her late husband. In 2011, Ra≈ænatoviƒá pleaded guilty to embezzling millions of euros from the transfers of players from the football club FK Obiliƒá, which she inherited from her late husband, and again illegal possession of eleven weapons. Ceca had sold fifteen players of FK Obiliƒá to several international football clubs (such as Fenerbah√ße). Serbian state prosecutors accused her of taking for personal use an illegal share in the sale of fifteen players. Ceca denied having been involved in any kind of illegal activities, saying that her late husband was responsible for FK Obiliƒá and that the eleven illegally possessed weapons found in her home also belonged to him. Under a plea bargain, Ra≈ænatoviƒá was ordered to spend eight months under house arrest, avoiding the maximum sentence that the charges against her could have carried, 12 (twelve) years in prison. Ceca is officially banned from entering Croatia due to being proclaimed persona non grata. In one interview she stated that because of that, she always remains careful while picking her travel routes.

Julio Vanzo's house, in front of the Parque de la Independencia, Rosario Julio Vanzo (12 October 1901 - 10 December 1984) was an artist born in Rosario, province of Santa Fe, Argentina. He descended from a family of artists of the Austrian Tyrol. Vanzo presented his first exhibition in 1919, at the inauguration of the Witcomb Gallery in Rosario. In 1941 he was invited to a joint exhibition that featured Lucio Fontana, Domingo Candia and Emilio Pettorutti at the Riverside Gallery of New York City, and in 1945 he participated in the contest for a Guggenheim scholarship. In 1953 he authored a series of zincography prints based on the theme of the Argentine national gauchesque poem Mart√≠n Fierro, which were also exhibited in New York. During his last years he shifted to the topic of tango culture. Vanzo was a collaborator of the art and literature magazine La Gaceta del Sur and the first secretary of the Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum (founded in 1937). Vanzo drew a sketch of the coat of arms for Rosario, his hometown, based on a previous version created by councilman Eudoro Carrasco in 1862 and modified by architect √Ångel Guido (designer of the National Flag Memorial) in 1957. The Deliberative Council of Rosario adopted Vanzo's new coat of arms for the city on 1964-11-24. An updated version was found in 2001 in Vanzo's home archives, where some items have been added or modernized. A reproduction of Vanzo's Bandone√≥n, depicting a tango musician playing a bandone√≥n, was painted to scale on the wall of a building in downtown Rosario in 2006, as part of an \\"urban museum\\" project. Vanzo's home and studio was donated by its last dweller, Vanzo's niece Mar√≠a Antonia Manzanel, to the Municipality of Rosario, upon her death in September 2006. Her testament specifies that the Municipality is to transform the house into a cultural space.

He spent over 35 years developing numerous scientific breakthroughs under the Johns Hopkins Medical School and Hospital. Personal life Gey was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on July 6, 1899, the son of German immigrants Frank and Emma Gey. He had an older brother and younger sister. Gey's parents immigrated from Germany, and according to the 1910 United States Census, they lived in suburban Pittsburgh. Gey graduated Peabody High School, and received undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Pittsburgh in 1920. Around 1926 he married Margaret K. (1900‚Äì1989), and they later moved to Baltimore where he would earn his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University. After graduating Hopkins in 1933, Gey immediately began his 37-year teaching career at the Johns Hopkins Medical School. Gey and his wife had two children, George Gey Jr. and Mrs. Frances Green. Their son, George O. Gey Jr., became a cardiologist, completing his internship and residency at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.  Career  =HeLa Cell Line= First image of HeLa cells taken by Dr. Gey 1951 In 1951, Gey's research assistant, Mary Kubicek, isolated the cells taken from a cervical tumor found in a woman named Henrietta Lacks. These cells proved to be very unusual in that they could grow in culture medium that was constantly stirred using the roller drum (a technique developed by Gey), and they did not need a glass surface to grow, and therefore they had no space limit. Once Gey realized the longevity and hardiness of the HeLa cells, he began sharing them with scientists all over the world, and the use of the HeLa cell line became widespread. The cells were used in the development of the polio vaccine, lead to the first clone of a human cell, helped in the discovery that humans have 46 chromosomes, and were used to develop in vitro fertilization. By the time Gey published a short abstract claiming some credit for the development of the line, the cells were already being used by scientists all over the world. =Controversies= Due to the unusual growth capabilities of the HeLa cell line, it contaminated many cell cultures and ruined years of research, as discovered by Stanley Gartler in 1966. The cells, as it turned out, could float on dust particles and could be transferred on unwashed hands or used pipettes, and therefore end up in other cell cultures. Because the cells were so pervasive, just one could lead to the complete take-over of a culture. There was also the controversy surrounding how the cells were retrieved, as made famous by the book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. The cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks without her knowledge or permission, and her family remained unaware until the 1970s. He was careful to keep her actual name secret, and it was not made public until after his death. =Roller Drum Technique= Gey is also credited for creating the roller drum, which was essential for the development of the HeLa cell line. This machine was one of the first to help nurture cell cultures. The roller drum consisted of various holes where tissues and their appropriate growth substances were all located. The drum spun in order to mix the substances and once an hour allow the cultures to be exposed to the environment until the drum rolled again and rebathed the cells in liquid. Gey is also noted to be one of the first to document cell division and growth on film. He devised a time lapse camera that stood twelve feet, built out of spare parts from a nearby junkyard, with a temperature controlled incubator.  Tissue Culture Association (TCA)  During Gey's tenure at Johns Hopkins, he founded and was the first president of the Tissue Culture Association (TCA). The main object of the TCA was to introduce scientists to tissue, culture methodology, and train technical personnel. TCA is known today as the Society for In Vitro Biology, which currently embraces over 1,500 members. Through years of fundraising Gey was able to raise the millions of dollars needed to open the permanent home for the TCA, W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center at Lake Placid, New York. A few of the medical advances achieved through the TCA include the clone growth of rodent cells, the development of time lapse cinematography, and the electron microscopic examination of cell structures.  Death and legacy  Gey died from pancreatic cancer on November 8, 1970 in Baltimore, Maryland, less than a year after his initial diagnosis. When undergoing an emergency procedure for his cancer, doctors found that the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, lungs and heart, thus making his cancer inoperable. Gey traveled to New York City to enroll himself in an experimental chemotherapy trial. He wanted doctors to try to cut out a piece of the cancer in his pancreas to grow a new cell line for cancer research. The doctors, however, didn't listen to him during the surgery and he was \\"furious\\" when he woke up, although he died later.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, by Rebecca Skloot An important legacy Gey left on the scientific world was his teaching. In his lab, the belief was that \\"the way to kill your cell cultures was by using a sloppy technique\\". He trained hundreds of researchers around the world in his sterile techniques and introduced the world to cautious studies. Although Gey was not given the chance to publish papers on his research or create patents before his untimely death, he left a legacy of understanding cancer, and began the foundation from which cancer research and cell culture has grown from.  Awards and Honors  In 1954, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center selected Gey to receive the Katherine Burken Judd Award for his contributions to cancer research.

In 1817, he was appointed professor of mathematics and physics in the gymnasium at Thorn. In 1821 he moved to Berlin, and in 1839 became a full professor in the University of Berlin. He delivered courses of lectures at the academy of architecture from 1824 to 1831, and at the schools of artillery and engineering from 1833 to 1852; and he also taught in the military school from 1826 to 1849. Work Ohm was the first to fully develop the theory of the exponential ab when both a and b are complex numbers in 1823. The 1835 second edition of Ohm's textbook, Die reine Elementar Mathematik was the first time that Euclid's 'extreme and mean ratio' was given the name of the \\"golden section\\" (goldener Schnitt).

Gnathostomiasis in animals can be serious, and even fatal. The first described case of gnathostomiasis was in a young tiger that died in the London Zoo in 1835. The larval nematode is acquired by eating raw or undercooked fish and meat. G. spinigerum has a multi-host life history. The eggs hatch in fresh water and the larvae are eaten by water fleas of the genus Cyclops. The water fleas are in turn eaten by small fish. Eventually, the larvae end up in the stomachs of carnivores, usually cats and dogs. The larva bores through the stomach wall and migrates around in the host's body for about three months before returning to the stomach and attaching itself in the gastric mucosa. It then takes another six months to mature. The eggs are carried in the host's feces, and if they reach fresh water the cycle begins again. As humans are not a normal host for the larva, they do not mature in humans, but can cause various degrees of damage, depending on where the larva wanders in the body. Description Video showing movement of G. spinigerum larvae in a copepod. This species grows to a length of . Species within the genus Gnathostoma are recognized by a bulbous head with a pair of lateral lips surrounding a mouth on the longitudinal axis. The cephalic region is covered by transverse rows of cuticular spines. Internally, the head is divided into four glandular cervical sacs that attach near the esophagus, as well as four hollow spaces called ballonets, each being continuous with a cervical sac via a central canal.Barnes, R. 1987. Invertebrate Zoology. Orlando, Florida: Dryden Press The body is typically pink and is also covered anteriorly with circles of flat spines, which become sparser and single-tipped further toward the end. Behind a bare region that constitutes roughly half of the body length, many small spines can be found on the posterior tip. the four species gnathostomiasis--G. doloresi, G. hispidum, G. nipponicum, and G. spinigerum can cause human ‚Äìthese species are differences in these external appearance and third larvae stage which is helpful for identification. As a nematode, Gnathostoma spinigerum has cylindrical, a cuticle layer with three main outer layers made of collagen and other compounds. The outer layers are non-cellular and are secreted by the epidermis. The cuticle layer protects the nematodes so they can invade the digestive tracts of animals. Nematodes have longitudinal muscles along the body wall. The muscles are obliquely arranged in bands. Dorsal, ventral and longitudinal nerve cords are connected to the main body of the muscle. As a nematode in the group Secernentea, Gnathostoma have specialized tubular excretory system with three canals. The canals are arranged to form an H. On average, female worms are larger than males by an estimated 4 mm in length and 0.65 mm in width. Respectively, their size ranges from 11 to 54 mm and 11 to 31 mm long. Females are different from males in that they possess only two large papillae around their slightly rounded posterior ends. From the side view, the dorsal outline is rounded, whereas the ventral side appears flat. Males have eight caudal papillae encompassing the anus on their bluntly rounded ends. Characteristic of males is the presence of blunt spicules that play the important reproductive role of holding open the vagina during sperm transfer. These male copulatory organs measure 1.1 mm and 0.4 mm long.Roberts, L., J. Janovy. 2000. Gerald D. Schmidt and Larry S. Roberts' Foundations of Parasitology, 6th edition. Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education Just before molting into an adult, fourth-stage larvae have eight transverse rows of cephalic hooklets. At this point of development males can easily be differentiated from females based on identifiable sexual organs. Advanced third-stage larvae bear four rows of hooklets on their head bulbs and measure 3 to 4 mm in length and 0.3 to 0.4 mm wide. The distinctive swollen head morphology, in addition to the four rows of hooklets, already becomes apparent in second-stage larvae. Eggs have a polar cap at only one end and are laid un- embryonated within pitted shells. Their dimensions are 65-70 ¬µm by 38-40 ¬µm Geographic range Although Gnathostoma spinigerum are considered endemic to Thailand, they are also found in many other countries of Southeast Asia. These nematode parasites have also been reported to be found in Japan, Australia, United States, and Mexico. However, the incidence of infection is rarer outside the Asian continent Daengsvang, S., U. Chulalerk, T. Papasarathorn, B. Tongkoom. 1964. Epidemiological Observations On Gnathostoma spinigerum In Thailand. Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 67: 144-147 Habitat Gnathostoma spinigerum normally could be found in wet tropical environments. Larvae can infect many classes of animals. Canine and feline species, and possibly pigs, are determined as c the definitive hosts. In Japan, freshwater fishes, Ophicephalus argus and O. tadianus, are the most important vectors of human gnathostomiasis. In addition to freshwater fishes, domestic duck, Anas platyrhynchus and the domestic chicken Gallus gallus domesticus carry the parasite in Thailand.Daengsvang, S., P. Thienprasitthi, P. Chomcherngpat. 1966. Further Investigations On Natural And Experimental Hosts Of Larvae Of Gnathostoma Spinigerum In Thailand. American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 15: 727-729 Prevention of gnathostomiasis In a study done in Thailand, researchers have proposed a method of prevention of gnathostomiasis. It states that humans can become infected via eating fresh water fish. For example, a popular dish serving fermented fresh water fish is popular among the women of Thailand, which may explain their higher incidence of the infection. In order to avoid or kill the infective larva living in fish muscle, one must boil the fish first for a minimum of five minutes, placed in a solution of vinegar and 4% acetic acid for a period of 5.5 hours, or just to avoid raw or undercooked fish, always being sure to cook fresh water fish thoroughly Daengsvang, S. 1949. Human Gnathostomaisis in Siam with reference to the method of prevention. The Journal of Parasitology 35: 116-121.  Treatment of gnathostomiasis  Laboratory testing on mice treated once or twice daily with albendazole were shown to have a significant reduction in worm count when compared to the untreated mice group. The effective dosage at which albendazole has been shown effective is 90 mg/kg twice a day for 21 straight days. On the other hand, there are other antihelminthic drugs available such as bithionol, thiabendazole, metronidazole, and others, that did not reveal any significant therapeutic effects in experimental G. spinigerum infections See also *List of parasites (human)  References   External links  *Tropical Medicine Central Resource - Gnathostomiasis - retrieved March 9, 2006 *Animal Diversity Web - Gnathostoma spinigerum - retrieved March 9, 2006 Spirurida Parasitic nematodes of humans Parasitic nematodes of vertebrates Parasitic helminths of fish Articles containing video clips Nematodes described in 1889 ","title":"Gnathostoma spinigerum"},{"id":"4336797","text":"Bikovo () is a village located in the Subotica municipality, in the North Baƒçka District of Serbia.

By combining the small momentum of a single photon with a velocity and spatially dependent absorption cross section and many absorption-spontaneous emission cycles, atoms with initial velocities of hundreds of metres per second can be slowed to tens of centimetres per second. Although charged particles can be trapped using a Penning trap or a Paul trap using a combination of electric and magnetic fields, those traps are ineffective for neutral atoms. Doppler cooling Photons have a momentum given by hbar k (where hbar is the reduced Planck constant and k the photon wavenumber), which is conserved in all atom-photon interactions. Thus, when an atom absorbs a photon, it is given a momentum kick in the direction of the photon before absorption. By detuning a laser beam to a frequency less than the resonant frequency (also known as red detuning), laser light is only absorbed if the light is frequency up-shifted by the Doppler effect, which occurs whenever the atom is moving towards the laser source. This applies a friction force to the atom whenever it moves towards a laser source. For cooling to occur along all directions, the atom must see this friction force along all three Cartesian axes; this is most easily achieved by illuminating the atom with three orthogonal laser beams, which are then reflected back along the same direction.  Magnetic trapping  Magnetic trapping is created by adding a spatially varying magnetic quadrupole field to the red detuned optical field needed for laser cooling. This causes a Zeeman shift in the magnetic-sensitive mf levels, which increases with the radial distance from the centre of the trap. Because of this, as an atom moves away from the centre of the trap, the atomic resonance is shifted closer to the frequency of the laser light, and the atom becomes more likely to get a photon kick towards the centre of the trap. The direction of the kick is given by the polarization of the light, which is either left or right handed circular, giving different interactions with the different mf levels. The correct polarisations are used so that photons moving towards the centre of the trap will be on resonance with the correct shifted atomic energy level, always driving the atom towards the centre. Atomic structure necessary for magneto-optical trapping The lasers needed for the magneto-optical trapping of rubidium 85: (a) & (b) show the absorption (red detuned to the dotted line) and spontaneous emission cycle, (c) & (d) are forbidden transitions, (e) shows that if the cooling laser excites an atom to the F=3 state, it is allowed to decay to the \\"dark\\" lower hyperfine, F=2 state, which would stop the cooling process, if it were not for the repumper laser (f). As a thermal atom at room temperature has many thousands of times the momentum of a single photon, the cooling of an atom must involve many absorption-spontaneous emission cycles, with the atom losing up to ƒßk of momenta each cycle . Because of this, if an atom is to be laser cooled, it must possess a specific energy level structure known as a closed optical loop, where following an excitation-spontaneous emission event, the atom is always returned to its original state. 85Rubidium, for example, has a closed optical loop between the 5S_{1/2} F=3 state and the 5P_{3/2} F=4 state. Once in the excited state, the atom is forbidden from decaying to any of the 5P_{1/2} states, which would not conserve parity, and is also forbidden from decaying to the 5S_{1/2} F=2 state, which would require an angular momentum change of ‚àí2, which cannot be supplied by a single photon. Many atoms that do not contain closed optical loops can still be laser cooled, however, by using repump lasers which re-excite the population back into the optical loop after it has decayed to a state outside of the cooling cycle. The magneto-optical trapping of rubidium 85, for example, involves cycling on the closed 5S_{1/2} F=3to5P_{3/2} F=4 transition. On excitation, however, the detuning necessary for cooling gives a small, but non-zero overlap with the 5P_{3/2} F=3 state. If an atom is excited to this state, which occurs roughly every thousand cycles, the atom is then free to decay either the F=3, light coupled upper hyperfine state, or the F=2 \\"dark\\" lower hyperfine state. If it falls back to the dark state, the atom stops cycling between ground and excited state, and the cooling and trapping of this atom stops. A repump laser which is resonant with the 5S_{1/2} F=2to5P_{3/2} F=3 transition is used to recycle the population back into the optical loop so that cooling can continue. Apparatus =Laser= All magneto-optical traps require at least one trapping laser plus any necessary repumper lasers (see above). These lasers need stability, rather than high power, requiring no more than the saturation intensity, but a linewidth much less than the Doppler width, usually several megahertz. Because of their low cost, compact size and ease of use, laser diodes are used for many of the standard MOT species while the linewidth and stability of these lasers is controlled using servo systems, which stabilises the lasers to an atomic frequency reference by using, for example, saturated absorption spectroscopy and the Pound-Drever-Hall technique to generate a locking signal. By employing a 2-dimensional diffraction grating it is possible to generate the configuration of laser beams required for a magneto-optical trap from a single laser beam and thus have a very compact magneto-optical trap.Nshii et al. =Vacuum chamber= The MOT cloud is loaded from a background of thermal vapour, or from an atomic beam, usually slowed down to the capture velocity using a Zeeman slower. However, the trapping potential in a magneto-optical trap is small in comparison to thermal energies of atoms and most collisions between trapped atoms and the background gas supply enough energy to the trapped atom to kick it out of the trap. If the background pressure is too high, atoms are kicked out of the trap faster than they can be loaded, and the trap does not form. This means that the MOT cloud only forms in a vacuum chamber with a background pressure of less than 10 micropascals (10‚àí10 bar). The limits to the magneto-optical trap A MOT cloud in two different density regimes:If the density of the MOT is high enough, the MOT cloud goes from having a Gaussian density distribution (left), to something more exotic (right). In the right hand image, the density is so high that atoms have been blown out of the central trapping region by radiation pressure, to then form a toroidal racetrack mode around it. Magneto- optical trap with a racetrack mode The minimum temperature and maximum density of a cloud in a magneto-optical trap is limited by the spontaneously emitted photon in cooling each cycle. While the asymmetry in atom excitation gives cooling and trapping forces, the emission of the spontaneously emitted photon is in a random direction, and therefore contributes to a heating of the atom. Of the two ƒßk kicks the atom receives in each cooling cycle, the first cools, and the second heats: a simple description of laser cooling which enables us to calculate a point at which these two effects reach equilibrium, and therefore define a lower temperature limit, known as the Doppler cooling limit. The density is also limited by the spontaneously emitted photon. As the density of the cloud increases, the chance that the spontaneously emitted photon will leave the cloud without interacting with any further atoms tends to zero. The absorption, by a neighboring atom, of a spontaneously emitted photon gives a 2ƒßk momentum kick between the emitting and absorbing atom which can be seen as a repulsive force, similar to coulomb repulsion, which limits the maximum density of the cloud.  Application  As a result of low densities and speeds of atoms achieved by optical cooling, the mean free path in a ball of MOT cooled atoms is very long, and atoms may be treated as ballistic. This is useful for quantum information experiments where it is necessary to have long coherence times (the time an atom spends in a defined quantum state). Because of the continuous cycle of absorption and spontaneous emission, which causes decoherence, any quantum manipulation experiments must be performed with the MOT beams turned off. In this case, it is common to stop the expansion of the gases during quantum information experiments by loading the cooled atoms into a dipole trap. A magneto-optical trap is usually the first step to achieving Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation. Atoms are cooled in a MOT down to a few times the recoil limit, and then evaporatively cooled which lowers the temperature and increases the density to the required phase space density. A MOT of 133Cs was used to make some of the best measurements of CP violation. See also * Dipole trap * Zeeman slower References  Liwag, John Waruel F.

Development  DEMOS's development was initiated in the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow in 1982, and development continued in cooperation from other institutes, and commercialized by DEMOS Co-operative which employed most key contributors to DEMOS and to its earlier alternative, MNOS (a clone of Unix Version 6). MNOS and DEMOS version 1.x were gradually merged from 1986 until 1990, leaving the joint OS, DEMOS version 2.x, with support for different Cyrillic charsets (KOI-8 and U-code, used in DEMOS 1 and MNOS, respectively). Initially it was developed for SM-4 (a PDP-11/40 clone) and SM-1600. Later it was ported to Elektronika-1082, BESM, ES EVM, clones of VAX-11(SM-1700), and a number of other platforms, including PC/XT, Elektronika-85 (a clone of DEC Professional), and a number of Motorola 68020-based microcomputers. The development of DEMOS effectively ceased in 1991, when the second project of the DEMOS team, RELCOM, took priority. The originally suggested name was –£–ù–ê–° (UNAS), which was a volapukish word play on Unix; \\"—É –Ω–∏—Ö\\" (\\"u nih\\") in Russian means \\"at theirs\\" or also \\"they have it\\", \\"—É –Ω–∞—Å\\" (\\"u nas\\") means \\"at ours\\" or also \\"we have it\\".

It also serves the adjacent area of Litherland. There are around four trains per hour, taking around 15 minutes to/from Liverpool Central. History The main section of the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway (LCSR), that between Waterloo and Southport, opened in July 1848. On 1 October 1850, the line was extended southwards to , where it connected with an existing line into Liverpool from Preston and from Bury. Among the intermediate stations on the extension was one at Seaforth, from the new southern terminus at (later Liverpool Exchange). The LCSR was absorbed by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at the start of 1855. Seaforth station was renamed Seaforth and Litherland in July 1905. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and in turn was Grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the start of 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948 and in 1978 the station became part of the Merseyrail network's Northern Line (operated by British Rail until privatised in 1995). The station also provided a service from 2 July 1905 to Dingle in south Liverpool (and all intermediate stations running parallel with the Liverpool dock system) via Liverpool on the Liverpool Overhead Railway until 30 December 1956, when the LOR was closed and later demolished. The station underwent improvement work in 2009. Facilities The station is staffed 15 minutes before the first service and 15 minutes after the last service. There is platform CCTV, shelters and a booking office. There are departure and arrival screens on the platform for passenger information. The station has a 48-space car park, a cycle rack with 6 spaces and secure storage for 28 cycles. The station is fully wheelchair accessible and access to the station is via a ramp which is 30 metres long.

The novel is a sequel to a popular fifteenth century set of chivalric romance novels, Amad√≠s de Gaula. While the novel itself has met with some criticism for its lack of literary style, it achieved particular notability in 1862 when Edward Everett Hale concluded that the novel was the origin of the name California. History Garci Rodr√≠guez de Montalvo initially translated and recast Amad√≠s de Gaula from Portuguese to Spanish. The original Amadis was in three volumes, but Montalvo added a fourth that is considered to be mostly his own work. Upon completion, Montalvo wrote the sequel, Las Sergas de Esplandi√°n, regarding the exploits of Esplandi√°n, the son of Amadis. The oldest known surviving edition of this work was published in Seville in July 1510. Earlier editions are thought to have been published in Seville as early as 1496. Ruth Putnam argues that Montalvo finished his novel sometime after 1492, but before Queen Isabella died in 1504. Montalvo is thought to have died in 1505, leaving some of his works to be published after his death. In the sixth chapter of Don Quixote, written by Miguel de Cervantes in 1605, Montalvo's sequel is mentioned as one of the books in Quixote's library. When Quixote's niece, the housekeeper, and the parish curate set out to destroy Quixote's library, considered the source of Quixote's fanciful behavior, Las Sergas de Esplandi√°n is the first book selected for the pyre. California Chivalric novels were popular at the time the Spanish empire was beginning to explore the New World. Such novels were a mix of truth, lore, and fiction, but with little clarity as to where each aspect of the novels fell. The explorers used the novels as a source of inspiration, while the authors of the novels, in turn, used the reports of new explorations to embellish their tales., Polk, Chapter 1. The Esplandi√°n novel describes a fictional island named California, (The first mention of \\"California\\" occurs on the unnumbered page after page CVIII, in the right column.) inhabited only by black women, ruled by Queen Calafia, and east of the Indies. When Spanish explorers, under the command of Hern√°n Cort√©s, learned of an island off the coast of Western Mexico, and rumored to be ruled by Amazon women, they named it California. Believing the Pacific Ocean, then called the South Sea, was much smaller than it turned out to be, the island seemed to precisely be east of the Indies just as the island of California was described in Montalvo's novel. Once the island was determined to be a peninsula, the name California had already been adopted, and the \\"island\\" eventually became known as the Baja California Peninsula.

Early life Al Kabli was born in the city of Port Sudan in 1933. During childhood, he developed an interest in the Arabic language, especially the old Arabic poems, and learned to play music on a penny whistle. At the age of sixteen, he moved to Khartoum to attend the Khartoum Commercial Secondary School, where he studied Sudanese folk music and Arabic poetry. His musical interest evolved to the oud (lute) and shetern (small drum), which he learned by himself.  Al Kabli's songs  Al Kabli's songs contain a diversity of topics and scenes including love, passion, revolution, nationalism and Sudanese folklore. Some of his songs make use of old Arabic poems. Others are in Sudanese Arabic dialect that require deep knowledge of the language and customs. Some of his famous songs include \\"Ya Bint Ashreen\\" (O that Girl in her twenties), \\"Husenek Fa Masher\\" (My Love Is More Than The Sweet Perfume...), \\"Sukker Sukker\\" (Sugar Sugar), \\"Asia wa Africa\\" (Asia and Africa), \\"Noama\\", \\"Cleopatra\\", \\"Limaza\\" (Why?), and \\"Merowi\\".

They work with interactive media, film, performance and installation to explore personal experience in relation with new technology, the mass media, and global commerce with work that is highly influenced through the perspective of Lev Manovich. They often re-examine classic genres and works of cinema, science fiction or television narrative, creating sculptural objects, net art, robotic movies or live performance They have projects that are collection of subcategories. In 2002 they received the Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Emerging Fields.(http://creative-capital.org/projects/view/126) They were awarded a 2011 Guggenheim Fellowship. Artwork In 1999, Jennifer and Kevin McCoy undertook the \\"World Views\\" residency programmed on the World Trade Center's 91st floor. From this residency, the artists developed a series of interventions into global capitalism. For example, the McCoys created web- based banner ads satirizing corporate aesthetics and jargon. The artists then used the Doubleclick.com network to distribute 1 million of these banner ads over one month, from mid-August to mid-September 1999. Doubleclick.com, which sponsored the project, did not inform sites on which the ads were displayed that they were playing host to an artistic intervention.Internet Retrograde: The Rise of Infomercials 1999 The McCoys are well known for their database pieces, in which they break down a series of films or TV shows into individual shots, and categorize them according to a classification schema of their own making. For example, the piece 'Every Shot Every Episode' (2001) was a collection of 10,000 shots from the Starsky and Hutch television series that were categorized according to 278 categories such as 'every plaid', 'every sexy outfit', 'every yellow Volkswagen'. Shots relating to each category were then burned to video CD and installed on a shelf in the gallery along with a small, specially designed video player. In 2002, the McCoys created \\"Horror Chase.\\" According to their website (mccoyspace.com) \\" This work is based on the climatic chase sequence from Evil Dead II. The artists re-enact the scene on a specially designed stage set. Each shot in the sequence is individually digitized. Custom computer software selects these clips at random, playing them back in a seamless but continuously variable way, changing the speed and direction of play. The images are projected at cinematic scale and the computer hardware is installed in a black briefcase, which forms part of the installation.\\"http://www.mccoyspace.com/project/45/ In 2004, the dormant Saarinen-designed TWA Flight Center (now Jetblue Terminal 5) at JFK Airport briefly hosted an art exhibition called Terminal 5 curated by Rachel K. Ward and featuring the work of 18 artists including Jennifer & Kevin McCoy. The show featured work, lectures and temporary installations drawing inspiration from the idea of travel -- and the terminal's architecture. The show was to run from October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2005 -- though it closed abruptly after the building itself was vandalized during the opening party. More recently, the McCoys have been creating works that use miniature dioramas similar to model railroads or dolls' houses. Live video cameras are embedded in each diorama, capturing the miniature figures and landscapes from various angles. The resulting video feeds are then sequenced by special computer software which acts as the film editor, creating a real-time animated film sequence to be projected on the gallery wall. In 'Soft Rains' (2003), the McCoys recreated archetypal scenes from cinema in this miniature form, making references to films such as Goldfinger, Friday the 13th, and Blue Velvet. 'Soft Rains' consisted of 6 installations: 'Beach Adventure,' \\"Cabaret,' 'Dinner Party,' 'The Loft,' 'The Spa,' and 'Suburban Horror.' The 'Traffic' series (2004) were recreations of moments from the artists' personal histories when they had a particular memory of viewing specific films. For example, Traffic #1: Our Second Date recreates the McCoys' second date when they went to see a film by Jean-Luc Godard at a cinema in Paris. \\"I'll Replace You,\\" (2008) offered a glimpse of the private life of the McCoys. The McCoy's staged scenes of their daily routines such as waking up, getting their children ready, teaching, meeting up with friends, etc.Kevin and Jennifer are 'replaced' by actors. Fifty actors were hired. In 2012 at Project Space in Seattle, WA set up a project called \\"Northwest Passing.\\" The artists borrowed work from collectors of northwest art. They then hired actors who knew nothing of the work to give improvised tours. Use of the term passing refers to actors 'passing' as experts, Jennifer and Kevin 'passing' as northwest artists, and the art itself 'passing' as northwest art.

This housing development was built in the 1950s as overspill accommodation for the colliery workers of nearby Newtongrange and Easthouses and for other essential workers, as well as to house the workforce for a small but relatively successful industrial estate. The decline of the coal industry in the 1980s led to the closure of the collieries. Lawfield Road, typical scene of modest housing and communal green space in Mayfield The massive growth in population in this part of Newbattle parish in the 1950s led to the existing mining village of Easthouses being virtually 'swallowed up' into the new housing development of Mayfield, which today has a population similar to that of a small town. With the communities of Mayfield and Easthouses ever expanding, in 1955 the Church of Scotland had an additional church building erected within Newbattle parish. Mayfield and Easthouses church was built in a more utilitarian and functional style than the 18th century building at Newbattle, as it had to double as both a place of worship and a place where the various church and other organisations (e.g. Boys Brigade [Anchor Boys, Junior Section, and Company Section], Girls Brigade, Cubs, Scouts, and Brownies) could establish themselves. There are three primary schools: Mayfield Primary School which is conjoined with St. Luke's RC Primary School, and Lawfield Primary School (which is a new school made up of the former Langlaw Primary and Bryans Primary).

Carrier was inspired by his son sliding on wet, painted concrete. Carrier used his job as an upholsterer to obtain a long strip of Naugahyde, to which he sewed a tube to pass a hose into, and punctured the tube intermittently to allow water to spurt out. Carrier sold his invention to Wham-O, which replaced Naugahyde with plastic to cut down on production costs. The toy is a long sheet of thin plastic, flanked lengthwise on one side by a heat-sealed tubular fold. The tube can be connected to any ordinary garden hose. Water runs through the tube and out small perforations, spraying onto the sliding surface. The Slip 'n Slide then becomes very slippery, enabling users to jump onto the plastic and slide the length of the sheet. Wham-O and makers of similar competitive products later included various enhancements such as an inflatable pool at one end of the sliding surface and spray tubes on both sides. Also operation is vastly improved by any lubrication liquids. Safety Both the manufacturer and the Consumer Product Safety Commission recommend that only children use the toy due to the risk of back and neck injuries when it is used by teenagers and adults. Injuries occur because people heavier or taller than children might stop suddenly when diving onto the toy. Between 1973 and 1991, seven adults and a 13-year-old suffered neck injuries or paralysis while using Slip ‚ÄôN Slides. References External links * Wham-O, Inc. * Wham-O, Inc.

Super Monkey Ball Adventure is a departure from the series in the sense that the puzzle-based gameplay is replaced by a more traditional 3D platform game world. Traveller's Tales has retained some of the mini-games, however, and integrated the features into the gameplay. Some new mini-games are also integrated into the adventure world. The game received mixed to negative reviews from critics, who derided the game‚Äôs controls, difficulty, and gameplay shift, with some deeming it the worst installment in the series, though the soundtrack was praised. Plot AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon are barbecuing bananas on Jungle Island when, all of a sudden, the alarm bells of the Tree Palace sound. King Junjun of Jungle Island tells them the sorrow and naysayers that have spread throughout the five kingdoms, brought on by Prince AbeABE of Monkitropolis and Princess Dee-Dee of Kongri-la's visit to the island. Once the prince and princess's identities are revealed, their true love for each other is, too. King Junjun and the Super Monkey Ball team work together to bring on the wedding of the year - but it is not easy. Monkitropolis and Kongri-la are great rivals, and before the wedding can happen, AiAi and friends must help bring peace to them. If the game is 100% completed, a visit from AiAi from the future will tell how the monkeys are inside magic energy balls, which are invented by AiAi and GonGon from a later time period, which is the reason the monkeys have balls. Baby returns home with this version of his father. Gameplay =Story Mode= There are five main worlds, or \\"Monkey Kingdoms\\", through which the player progresses: Jungle Island, Moonhaven, Zootopia, Monkitropolis, and Kongri-la. The goal of the game is to unite the feuding kingdoms of Monkitropolis and Kongri-la. Follow the normal story and complete over 60 quests from the monkeys around the Monkey World, using up to three different files. There are on average, four sections to each world. To enter a different section, the player must wait several seconds. During that time, the game depicts the entire level from a high angle, showing everything in the level in an animated style. The same style shows up when Aiai teleports to another level. It depicts the four main monkeys blasting off into the sky while loading the level. Missions involve helping haywire problems going back to normal, fixing machines, and helping local monkeys out. Pospos the mailmonkey helps deliver messages to some characters invited to the wedding for a band reunion. However, he needs a little help remembering their name. Although the player has to bring peace back to the five islands, there are some monsters, called \\"Naysayers,\\" trying to stop them. These Naysayers are monsters that are formed from sorrow, as the peace had become disturbed. In order to advance to the next world, the player must complete at least 60% of missions in each world. Some missions are simple, while others are more lengthy and challenging. =Challenge Mode= Re-visit puzzle stages that have been unlocked in the game and compete for high-scores (possibly to win bananas that can be used to unlock new items). Unlike all the other games, SMBA has no practice mode to practice levels that were previously completed by the player. These levels are contained in story mode. There are six continues of three lives, totaling 18 lives altogether. Like all games in the Super Monkey Ball franchise, the player must control their selected monkey of the four main characters (Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon) with the analog stick to cross platforms, to reach the goal in a time limit of a minute. The goal is a circle-shape with a party ball on above a banner reading \\"GOAL\\". The monkey must pass through it to move on, breaking open the party ball and celebrating. Falling off the platforms or letting the timer reach zero causes the player to lose a life. Fifty bananas are required to gain a life, which are usually placed in corners of levels and hard-to-reach and risky places. The monkeys have unlimited lives here, with the choice to give up and return to the game. The levels are themed as the same as the main Monkey Kingdoms, depending on the difficulty (ex. Jungle Island's color, green, and backdrop is used for the beginner levels). Also a feature removed is that there are no extra stages added on to the Beginner, Advanced and Expert modes. There are 49 stages; 12 beginner, 20 advanced and 17 expert. Stages have several random music tracks playing, some from previous Monkey Ball games. During Story mode, these levels are in areas of the Monkey Kingdoms. In order to unlock new areas of the Kingdom, Aiai must complete a majority of the levels to progress. Stages come in bunches of four to ten stages per area. =Party Games= There are six different available mini-games, complete with multi-player support, with 20 selectable characters to choose from. Additional features beyond the basic ones are unlocked through an NPC-Store using bananas gathered during adventure mode. Development Where as previous Super Monkey Ball games focused mainly on innovative gameplay, Sega emphasized plot in Super Monkey Ball Adventure as a move to make the game more accessible. Critical reception Super Monkey Ball Adventure received mixed to negative reviews from critics and holds a score of 51/100 on all platforms according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. It obtained a rare ranking of zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes' video game section. The game was criticized for the series‚Äô unwelcome shift to platform-adventure gameplay, controls, and difficulty, with many publications deeming it the worst in the series. Nintendo Power gave the game a 5.5 out of 10 rating and it, along with many other sources, claimed it was the worst installment thus far in the Super Monkey Ball series. X-Play gave it a 1 out of 5. IGN gave the game a \\"Bad\\" rating at 4.8 out of 10, stating that \\"We just want to play the damned puzzle mazes.\\" The game's soundtrack, however, was highly praised.

Kramer produced aluminum-necked electric guitars and basses in the 1970s and wooden-necked guitars catering to hard rock and heavy metal musicians in the 1980s; Kramer is currently a division of Gibson Guitar Corporation. Formation Gene Simmons axe bass guitar. acoustic. Korean Kramer. There is some dispute over the company's early history but it begins with Travis Bean, a California luthier who was building guitars with aluminum necks. Bean and Gary Kramer started the Travis Bean guitar company in 1974, in Sun Valley, and while their guitars did well, Bean lost interest and left most of the business aspects to Kramer; the two parted ways. Kramer then founded the company that still bears his name, improving on the Bean design‚ÄîBean's necks were heavy and the material felt cold to the touch. Kramer's improvement consisted of two wooden inserts in the back of the neck. By 1975 he had hooked up with a friend from New York, Dennis Berardi and the two founded BK International, which engaged luthier Phil Petillo to make prototypes for them. Other involved parties were Henry Vaccaro, a real estate businessman who invested money in the venture and Peter LaPlaca, who had experience with Norlin, the company that owned Gibson Guitar Corporation from 1969 to 1986. The rest of the account is murky: Kramer says he was supposed to increase production but was too inexperienced in that area so he wanted to move back to the West Coast. He was to sell back his interests and receive royalties then represent the company out west but none of this seems to have happened. 1970s: aluminum necks Introduced in 1976, early models featured the trademark \\"tuning fork head\\" aluminum-reinforced necks with a fretboard made of Ebonol‚Äîmaterial similar to one used in bowling ball production. Other features of the necks included aluminum dots, and a zero fret. Gary Kramer's inserts, set in epoxy, were usually walnut or maple. The bodies were usually made of high grade Walnut or Maple, with the earliest instruments made of exotic tonewoods including Koa, Afromosia, Swietenia, Shedua, and Bubinga. The hardware was also from a known quality brand: Schaller tuning keys and bridges; Schaller and DiMarzio pickups; custom-made strap pins; aluminum cavity covers. Kramer's \\"alumi-neck\\" line lasted roughly until 1982. Generally, the ratio of basses to guitars produced was about 4:1, primarily because bass players were more willing to experiment. By 1981, Kramer had the tools, and the experience, to take guitar mass production to a new level. Switching to wooden-necked instruments both held the promise of keeping production costs low as well as being able to appeal to traditionally-minded guitar players. Wooden neck period Kramer first released wooden-necked guitars in late 1981, following Charvel's lead on producing instruments that essentially copied the stratocaster headstock shape from Fender, in violation of Fender's US trademark and design patent. After only a thousand or so instruments were built, in May 1981, Kramer received a cease and desist order from Fender to halt the production of strathead guitars. Instead, Kramer opted for a \\"beak\\" headstock reminiscent of 1960s Kent guitar headstocks. The earliest beak guitars were in fact stratheads with a lopped off headstock; these can be identified by prominent sanding marks on the curve of the headstock. Later, and most common beak guitars, were manufactured with a beak headstock from the factory. Wooden-necked instruments represented Kramer's first foray into offshoring the production of guitar components to Eastern Asia. Tuning keys and vintage fulcrum tremolos were made by Gotoh in Japan, while the necks were made by Japan's ESP Guitars and shipped to New Jersey for fretting and finishing. Kramer executives saw that the guitar techniques of the early 1980s demanded a high-performance tremolo system. Kramer partnered with a German inventor named Helmut Rockinger, and installed his bulky tremolos, precursors to Floyd Rose systems, on its instruments. Early to mid-1980s A chance encounter between Dennis Berardi and Eddie Van Halen's managers on an airplane flight set the foundation for Kramer's meteoric rise in the 1980s. Eddie was interested in a tremolo that stayed in tune, which the Rockinger system offered. A meeting between Eddie Van Halen and Kramer execs took place, and Eddie was sold. At the meeting, he reportedly quipped that he would help make Kramer the \\"#1 guitar company in the world.\\" By 1983 the Rockinger tremolo (sometimes dubbed \\"The Eddie Van Halen tremolo\\") had been widely replaced by the Floyd Rose system. In addition, Kramer once again offered Schaller tuners on their guitars, tapping Schaller to produce Floyd Rose tremolos as well. Kramer was the only guitar company offering Original Floyd Rose tremolos stock on their production guitars, a competitive advantage of Kramer over other guitar manufacturers of the period. In late 1983 Kramer switched from the \\"beak\\" headstock design to the Gibson Explorer-like \\"banana\\" headstock design. This distinctive look also helped rank Kramer highly with guitar enthusiasts. One notable Kramer guitar was the Baretta model, which was a single-humbucker instrument similar to guitars Eddie Van Halen used on stage. The Kramer Baretta was the flagship of the Kramer line and helped popularize the single-pickup 1980s superstrat guitar design. By late 1985 Kramer began installing Seymour Duncan pickups in its guitars, in preference to the more vintage-sounding Schaller pickups. When the sales figures came in, Kramer was the best-selling guitar brand of 1985. In 1986 Kramer switched to the radically drooped \\"pointy headstock\\" design, no doubt influenced by the pointy designs of Jackson/Charvel and other manufacturers such as Hamer and Washburn. Schaller tuners, Floyd Rose tremolos, Seymour Duncan pickups and exciting graphics by talented factory artists such as Dennis Kline helped propel Kramer to become the best-selling guitar brand of 1986. Late 1980s Kramer continued its success into the late 1980s, promoting hard rock and glam metal artists from M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Mick Mars to Whitesnake's Vivian Campbell as major endorsees. By 1987, Kramer was using ESP Guitars exclusively for manufacturing its necks and bodies. The \\"American Series\\" of instruments were ESP parts, assembled in Neptune, New Jersey. The Aerostar series were made completely in Korea, while the Focus series was made and assembled by ESP Guitars. Some early Focus guitars were also made in Japan by the Matsumoku company. During 1987, Kramer also commissioned guitarist Rich Excellente, designer of the \\"1957 Chevy Tail-fin\\" guitar, to create a series of guitars based on the patented features Excellente developed on his \\"Chevy Tail-Fin\\" guitar. Kramer, under license from Excellente, manufactured a line of guitars which were marketed as \\"The Kramer American Showster Series\\". These guitars were sleeker versions of the more traditional shapes of the day, and utilized Excellente's patented \\"tear-drop\\" body taper and \\"metal loading\\" insert feature to increase tone and sustain.(U.S.Pat.4,635,522). Fewer than 1,000 of these guitars were produced between 1988‚Äì1990, and the line was discontinued during 1990 due to manufacturing problems which began to plague Kramer during that time. In addition, Kramer embraced the excess of the late 1980s‚Äîproducing slick and fluorescent guitars, losing its thought leadership in the guitar manufacturing arena, and damaging the image of the brand. Similarly, the image of the Kramer brand was being tarnished by an influx of Aerostar guitars, lower in quality and made with cheap parts. By 1989, Dennis Berardi had started Berardi/Thomas Entertainment, Inc‚Äîan artist management company. Seeing promise in a young band out of the Soviet Union, Gorky Park, BTE started managing the group. To help promote the band, the infamous \\"Gorky Park\\" guitars were made, reportedly to be given to guitar dealers as promotional pieces. BTE banked on the Gorky Park guitars to help promote the group. When the Russian band achieved only a mild measure of success, this was a significant, and final blow to the first incarnation of the Kramer company. 1990‚Äìpresent The original Kramer company effectively came to an end in January 1991, mostly due to financial problems. The company had been spending huge amounts on advertising and endorsements, and then lost a lawsuit with Floyd D. Rose over royalties. A notorious firesale of surplus necks, bodies and hardware was held out of New Jersey. In the early '90s, Artist Relations manager Billy \\"Falcon\\" Connolly left New Jersey and moved to Princeton, West Virginia and started a small guitar company called Falcon Custom Guitars. Billy made fine electric and beautiful hand made acoustic guitars that are cherished by his Kramer fans. Falcon Custom Guitars came to an untimely close at the end of summer of 1999 when Billy died. By 1995, Henry Vaccaro Sr. owned the Kramer brand; in addition, he was the only one of the original partners interested in continuing in the guitar business. He tried one last time to produce Kramer guitars from surplus parts, in the Neptune plant, but only a few hundred were made. Henry Vaccaro Sr. started making aluminum-necked guitars under the name Vaccaro Guitars, but that, too, was short-lived. In 2005 the original founder and namesake of Kramer Guitars, Gary Kramer, started his own guitar company: Gary Kramer Guitars.garykramerguitar.com In 2007, the original service manager of Kramer Guitars, legendary luthier Paul Unkert started his own guitar company, featuring designs reminiscent of aluminum-era Kramers: Unk Guitars.unkguitars.com The Kramer brand was sold out of bankruptcy to Gibson Guitar Corporation. Gibson's Epiphone division has produced guitars and basses under the Kramer brand since the late 1990s, mostly factory-direct through the now-defunct MusicYo.com website. Encouraged by the resurgence of interest in the Kramer brand, Epiphone has been reissuing classic Kramer models, including the \\"1984 Model;\\" (a homage to Eddie Van Halen's famous \\"5150\\" guitar used from 1984-1991) the \\"Jersey Star;\\" (a homage to the Richie Sambora signature 1980s Kramer) and most recently, the \\"1985 Baretta Reissue (A standard slant-pickup Baretta)\\". These high-end instruments are assembled in the USA from American components. In January 2009, Gibson shut down the MusicYo.com website, instead promising that Kramers would be available through dealers and in music stores by the end of 2009. But supply was not consistent and promised new models were either seriously delayed or never produced. More recently however under guidance from a dedicated Kramer team at Gibson, new models have made it to stores, and now includes the budget priced Baretta Special (a model touted on the MusicYo pages but never released until now) plus designs never seen before including the Pariah & Assault (including FR tremolo models) ranges brought out to bring the Kramer name to a new generation of rock musicians, while homages to vintage models like the Stagemaster in the form of the SM-1 and Classic Pacer Imperial now simply called the Pacer Vintage are also still produced.http://www.kramerguitars.com/Products/Pacer/Pacer-Vintage.aspx The KRAMER Pacer Vintage Guitar In 2007, a Kramer Striker controller was created for Guitar Hero III for the PlayStation 2, under a licensing agreement with Gibson Guitar Corporation. A Kramer Focus was also available as an in-game guitar, as was one of the earlier aluminum neck model Kramers. The Kramer Fatboy has been featured in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. Original Kramer guitars are now highly collectable, after being considered undesirable in the early-mid-1990s. They regularly fetch high prices on eBay and other auction sites. Kramer collectors held a Kramer Expo every year in Nashville, Tennessee, near the Gibson plant, from 2003-2008. More recently, expos have been held annually in locations around Europe including the Netherlands, Newcastle upon Tyne in 2006 & 2007, and Liverpool, UK in 2010 & 2012, to showcase and celebrate Kramer guitars.

See: \\"CEA, 400's, District Office\\" on the map  History  By 1957, the school age population of the Tamalpais Union High School District had grown too large for Tamalpais High School and Sir Francis Drake High School to accommodate. With the pressure of students coming in from elementary schools from Sausalito to Belvedere to Ross, voters chose to create a new school, and chosen for its site was the marshy area that extended east from the centrally located town of Larkspur to U.S. Route 101, an area that townspeople had called \\"the slough\\" since Larkspur was settled. The importance of wetlands was not yet widely appreciated (this was the era right before Save the Bay was founded), and the land was seen as \\"waste.\\" Beginning in early 1957, a large section of the marsh was flattened and filled, two roads were cut through from Magnolia Avenue out to the new school, and school buildings were constructed, along with a playing field and parking lot. The school opened its doors in 1958. The first students who were to attend the new high school chose the name of the newspaper and sports teams: the Giants became their mascot in reference to the nearby redwood trees. School publications followed the tree theme: the Bark became the school's newspaper, and the Log the school's year book. The colors red and gray were a source of much contention, but were finally accepted. On September 11, 2008, Redwood was recognized by the federal Blue Ribbon Schools Program.Rob Rogers, Marin Independent Journal, \\"Redwood Recognized as Blue Ribbon School,\\" 2008-09-11, accessed 2008-09-11 The school has received the California Distinguished School award three times (1990, 1996, and 2003).  Campus  Redwood High School, main entrance Redwood High School is set at the foot of Mount Tamalpais on a 63.88 acre campus which has 81 classrooms, a library, theater, swimming pool, and athletics fields. The original campus was opened in 1958, with additions to the main building made over the next few years. Redwood's main school building (an original; see above) contains approximately 69 classrooms, the Bessie Chin Library, four labs, and the theater. Other buildings on the campus contain industrial technology areas; photography, ceramics, and graphic arts studios; band room; and a cafeteria. Other sports and performance facilities include a large gymnasium and smaller gyms, a 40-meter swimming pool, tennis courts, a track, athletic fields, and an outdoor amphitheater. Between 2002 and 2006, Redwood High School undertook major modernization as part of a $121 million facilities bond measure approved by the Tam District voters. Approximately $40 million was spent to remodel classrooms, refurbish the gymnasium, tennis courts, and theater, and install new athletics fields. In 2007‚Äì2008 Redwood again rebuilt the often flooded parking lot. During the 2008‚Äì2009 school year, a new small gymnasium was constructed, the 40-meter pool was built, and new tennis courts laid. During the summer of 2011, an experimental classroom space was created to allow teachers the opportunity to explore new technologies, classroom management, and instructional strategies. In the spring of 2006, Redwood art students created a 40-foot mural of the Marin County countryside. The mural was created on an exterior wall of the cafeteria.

After the extensive development of the railway network during the 1840s, rapid economic growth and modernisation sparked the process of industrialisation. The largest economy in Europe by 1900, Germany had established a primary position in several key sectors, like the Chemical industry and steel production. High production capacity, permanent competitiveness and subsequent protectionist policies fought out with the USA and Britain were essential factors for Germany's entry into the World Wars. By the end of World War II, the country's economic infrastructure was completely destroyed. West Germany embarked in its program of reconstruction with financial support provided by the Marshall Plan and, guided by the economic principles of the Minister of Economics Ludwig Erhard excelled in the economic miracle during the 1950s and 1960s. East Germany's last remaining economic facilities were dismantled by the Soviet occupation force as one of the first steps of the war reparations plan. The country was embedded in the Eastern Bloc system of socialist planned economy. Contemporary Germany employs a highly skilled work force in the largest national economy as the largest exporter of high quality goods in Europe, like cars, machinery, pharmaceutics, chemical and electrical products with a GDP of 3.67 trillion USD in 2017. Medieval Germany Medieval Germany, lying on the open Northern European Plain, was divided into hundreds of contending kingdoms, principalities, dukedoms/duchies, bishoprics/dioceses, and free cities. Economic prosperity did not mean geographical expansion; it required collaboration with some, competition with others, and an intimate understanding among government, commerce, and production. A desire to save was also born in the German experience of political, military, and economic uncertainty.Horst Fuhrmann, Germany in the High Middle Ages (Cambridge University Press, 1986) =Towns and cities= L√ºbeck, 15th century Cologne around 1411 Total population estimates of the German territories range around 5 to 6 million by the end of Henry III's reign in 1056 and about 7 to 8 million after Friedrich Barbarossa's rule in 1190. The vast majority were farmers, typically in a state of serfdom under the control of nobles and monasteries.Fuhrmann, Germany in the High Middle Ages (1986) ch 1 Towns gradually emerged and in the 12th century many new cities were founded along the trading routes and near imperial strongholds and castles. The towns were subjected to the municipal legal system. Cities such as Cologne, that had acquired the status of Imperial Free Cities, were no longer answerable to the local landlords or bishops, but immediate subjects of the Emperor and enjoyed greater commercial and legal liberties. The towns were ruled by a council of the - usually mercantile - elite, the patricians. Craftsmen formed guilds, governed by strict rules, which sought to obtain control of the towns; a few were open to women. Society had diversified, but was divided into sharply demarcated classes of the clergy, physicians, merchants, various guilds of artisans, unskilled day labourers and peasants. Full citizenship was not available to paupers. Political tensions arose from issues of taxation, public spending, regulation of business, and market supervision, as well as the limits of corporate autonomy.David Nicholas, The Growth of the Medieval City: From Late Antiquity to the Early Fourteenth Century (Longman, 1997) pp 69-72, 133-42, 202-20, 244-45, 300-307 Cologne's central location on the Rhine river placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west and was the basis of Cologne's growth.Paul Strait, Cologne in the Twelfth Century (1974) The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterized by the city's status as a major harbor and transport hub upon the Rhine. It was governed by its burghers.Joseph P. Huffman, Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300. =Hanseatic League= Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League Jacob Fugger (right) and his accountant M. Schwarz The Hanseatic League was a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant guilds of towns and cities in northern and central Europe, that dominated marine trade in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and along the connected navigable rivers during the Late Middle Ages ( 12th to 15th centuries ). Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the Free imperial cities, had only a limited degree of political autonomy. Beginning with an agreement of the cities of L√ºbeck and Hamburg, guilds cooperated in order to strengthen and combine their economic assets, like securing trading routes and tax privileges, to control prices and better protect and market their local commodities. Important centers of commerce within the empire, such as Cologne on the Rhine river and Bremen on the North Sea joined the union, which resulted in greater diplomatic esteem. Recognized by the various regional princes for the great economic potential, favorable charters for, often exclusive, commercial operations were granted.Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: During its zenith the alliance maintained trading posts and kontors in virtually all cities between London and Edinburgh in the west to Novgorod in the east and Bergen in Norway. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with military means, if necessary. This culminated in a war with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark from 1361 to 1370. Principal city of the Hanseatic League remained L√ºbeck, where in 1356 the first general diet was held and its official structure was announced. The league declined after 1450 due to a number of factors, such as the 15th- century crisis, the territorial lords' shifting policies towards greater commercial control, the silver crisis and marginalization in the wider Eurasian trade network, among others.Istvan Szepesi, \\"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\\" Waterloo Historical Review 7 (2015). online Between 1347 and 1351 Germany and Europe were haunted by the most severe outbreak of the Black Death pandemic. Estimated to have caused the abrupt death of 30 to 60% of Europe's population, it led to widespread social and economic disruption and deep religious disaffection and fanaticism. Minority groups, and Jews in particular were blamed, singled out and attacked. As a consequence, many Jews fled and resettled in Eastern Europe. The death of large parts of the popilation caused a major collapse of the labour force. Human power became a rare commodity and the social and economic situation of average workers improved for several decades as employers were forced to pay higher wages. =Change and reform= The early-modern European society gradually developed after the disasters of the 14th century as religious obedience and political loyalties declined in the wake of the Great Plague, the schism of the Church and prolonged dynastic wars. The rise of the cities and the emergence of the new burgher class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism. The commercial enterprises of the mercantile patriciate family of the Fuggers of Augsburg generated unprecedented financial means. As financiers to both the leading ecclesiastical and secular rulers, the Fuggers fundamentally influenced the political affairs in the empire during the 15th and 16th century. The increasingly money based economy also provoked social discontent among knights and peasants and predatory \\"robber knights\\" became common. The knightly classes had traditionally established their monopoly through warfare and military skill. However, the shift to practical mercenary infantry armies and military-technical advances led to a marginalization of heavy cavalry. Early Modern Germany Unlike most Western European countries, Germany as a domain of the Holy Roman Empire, which lacked a strong centralized leadership, did not embark on the exploration of the world during the 16th and 17th century Age of Discovery, nor did it establish a trading fleet, trading posts and colonies during the subsequent era of colonialism. As a consequence Germany's society remained stagnant as its economy played only a secondary role with limited access to international markets and resources, while in France, Britain and the Netherlands, worldwide trade and colonial possessions greatly empowered mercantile and industrial groups and led to the rise of a bourgeoisie, who was able to benefit from the new economic opportunities. =Thirty Years' War= The Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) was ruinous to the twenty million civilians and set back the economy for generations, as marauding armies burned and destroyed what they could not seize. The fighting often was out of control, with marauding bands of hundreds or thousands of starving soldiers spreading plague, plunder, and murder. The armies that were under control moved back and forth across the countryside year after year, levying heavy taxes on cities, and seizing the animals and food stocks of the peasants without payment. The enormous social disruption over three decades caused a dramatic decline in population because of killings, disease, crop failures, declining birth rates and random destruction, and the emigration of terrified people. One estimate shows a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 to 10 million by 1650, while another shows \\"only\\" a 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million. The Altmark and W√ºrttemberg regions were especially hard hit. It took generations for Germany to fully recover.Geoffrey Parker, The Thirty Years' War (1997) p 178 has 15-20% decline; Tryntje Helfferich, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History (2009) p. xix, estimates a 25% decline. Peter H. Wilson, The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy (2009) pp 780-95 reviews the estimates. According to John Gagliardo, the recovery period lasted for about fifty years until the end of the century and was over by the 1700s. At that time, Germany probably had reached its pre-war population (though this is disputed). Then, there was a period of steady though quite slow growth to the 1740s. Afterward came a period of rapid but not exceptional economic expansion, that mainly occurred in the great states in the east (Austria, Saxony, Prussia) rather than in the small states of central or south Germany.Germany under the old regime, John Gagliardo =Peasants and rural life= Peasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body and help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. Across Germany and especially in the east, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land.Heide Wunder, \\"Serfdom in later medieval and early modern Germany\\" in T. H. Aston et al. eds., Social Relations and Ideas: Essays in Honour of R. H. Hilton (Cambridge UP, 1983), 249-72 In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman.The monasteries of Bavaria, which controlled 56% of the land, were broken up by the government, and sold off around 1803. Thomas Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800-1866 (1996), p 59 Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Within the family, the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscription required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.Sagarra, A Social History of Germany: 1648-1914 (1977) pp. 140-54For details on the life of a representative peasant farmer, who migrated in 1710 to Pennsylvania, see Bernd Kratz, \\"Jans Stauffer: A Farmer in Germany before his Emigration to Pennsylvania,\\" Genealogist, Fall 2008, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp 131-169 The emancipation of the serfs came in 1770-1830, beginning with then Danish Schleswig in 1780. Prussia abolished serfdom with the October Edict of 1807, which upgraded the personal legal status of the peasantry and gave them the chance to purchase for cash part of the lands they were working. They could also sell the land they already owned. The edict applied to all peasants whose holdings were above a certain size, and included both Crown lands and noble estates. The peasants were freed from the obligation of personal services to the lord and annual dues. A bank was set up so that landowner could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants were not allowed to use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasant became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land like serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.Sagarra, A social history of Germany, pp 341-45 Industrial Revolution Kemna ploughing engine Before 1850 Germany lagged behind the leaders in industrial development, United Kingdom, France and Belgium. However, the country had considerable assets : a highly skilled labor force, a good educational system, a strong work ethic, good standards of living and a sound protectionist strategy based on the Zollverein. By mid-century, the German states were catching up, and by 1900 Germany was a world leader in industrialization, along with Britain and the United States. In 1800, Germany's social structure was poorly suited to any kind of social or industrial development. Domination by modernizing France during the era of the French Revolution (1790s to 1815) produced important institutional reforms, including the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. Nevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in most of Germany. Until mid- century, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches, and the government bureaucracies had so many rules and restrictions that entrepreneurship was held in low esteem, and given little opportunity to develop. From the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony, and other states reorganized agriculture, introducing sugar beets, turnips, and potatoes, yielding a higher level of food production that enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas. The beginning of the industrial revolution in Germany came in the textile industry, and was facilitated by eliminating tariff barriers through the Zollverein, starting in 1834. The takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists, and stimulated investments in coal and iron.Richard Tilly, \\"Germany: 1815-1870\\" in Rondo Cameron, ed. Banking in the Early Stages of Industrialization: A Study in Comparative Economic History (Oxford University Press, 1967), pages 151-182 The political decisions about the economy of Prussia (and after 1871, all of Germany) were largely controlled by a coalition of \\"rye and iron\\", that is the Junker landowners of the east and the heavy industry of the west.Cornelius Torp, \\"The \\"Coalition of 'Rye and Iron'\\" under the Pressure of Globalization: A Reinterpretation of Germany's Political Economy before 1914,\\" Central European History Sept 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 401-427 =Regions= The north German states were for the most part richer in natural resources than the southern states. They had vast agricultural tracts from Schleswig-Holstein in the west through Prussia in the east. They also had coal and iron in the Ruhr Valley. Through the practice of primogeniture, widely followed in northern Germany, large estates and fortunes grew. So did close relations between the owners and local as well as national governments. The south German states were relatively poor in natural resources and those Germans therefore engaged more often in small economic enterprises. They also had no primogeniture rule but subdivided the land among several offspring, leading those offspring to remain in their native towns but not fully able to support themselves from their small parcels of land. The south German states, therefore, fostered cottage industries, crafts, and a more independent and self-reliant spirit less closely linked to the government. =Coal= Historical coalfields of Western Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Northern France The first important mines appeared in the 1750s, in the valleys of the rivers Ruhr, Inde and Wurm where coal seams outcropped and horizontal adit mining was possible. In 1782 the Krupp family began operations near Essen. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the Ruhr Area, which then became part of Prussia, took advantage of the tariff zone (Zollverein) to open new mines and associated iron smelters. New railroads were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on ironworks, using local coal. The iron and steel works typically bought mines and erected coking ovens to supply their own requirements in coke and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms (\\"Huettenzechen\\") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called \\"Konzern.\\" The output of an average mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, this output had risen to 280,000 and employment to about 1,400. Total Ruhr coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.Pounds (1952) By the end of 2010, only five coal mines were producing in Germany. The miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.Stefan Llafur Berger, \\"Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in the South Wales and the Ruhr Coalfields, 1850-2000: A Comparison,\\" Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru (2001) 8#2 pp 5-40. =Banks and cartels= German banks played central roles in financing German industry. Different banks formed cartels in different industries. Cartel contracts were accepted as legal and binding by German courts although they were held to be illegal in Britain and the United States. The process of cartelization began slowly, but the cartel movement took hold after 1873 in the economic depression that followed the postunification speculative bubble. It began in heavy industry and spread throughout other industries. By 1900 there were 275 cartels in operation; by 1908, over 500. By some estimates, different cartel arrangements may have numbered in the thousands at different times, but many German companies stayed outside the cartels because they did not welcome the restrictions that membership imposed. The government played a powerful role in the industrialization of the German Empire founded by Otto von Bismarck in 1871 during a period known as the Second Industrial Revolution. It supported not only heavy industry but also crafts and trades because it wanted to maintain prosperity in all parts of the empire. Even where the national government did not act, the highly autonomous regional and local governments supported their own industries. Each state tried to be as self-sufficient as possible. The beginning of rapid industrialization also gave rise to the period of ‚Äúintegration‚Äù, in the Foreign Direct Investment made by the German companies. One of the main justifications was the growing competition among local enterprises, especially in the newly emerging industries. Despite the several ups and downs of prosperity and depression that marked the first decades of the German Empire, the ultimate wealth of the empire proved immense. German aristocrats, landowners, bankers, and producers created what might be termed the first German economic miracle, the turn-of- the-century surge in German industry and commerce during which bankers, industrialists, mercantilists, the military, and the monarchy joined forces. =Class and the welfare state= Germany's middle class, based in the cities, grew exponentially, but it never gained the political power it had in France, Britain or the United States. The Association of German Women's Organizations (BDF) was established in 1894 to encompass the proliferating women's organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working- class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists.Eda Sagarra, A Social History of Germany 1648-1914 (2002) Bismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European welfare state. His paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher, but welfare did not exist.E. P. Hennock, The Origin of the Welfare State in England and Germany, 1850‚Äì1914: Social Policies Compared (2007); Hermann Beck, Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia, 1815-1870 (1995) Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.Elaine Glovka Spencer, \\"Rules of the Ruhr: Leadership and Authority in German Big Business Before 1914,\\" Business History Review, Spring 1979, Vol. 53 Issue 1, pp 40-64; Ivo N. Lambi, \\"The Protectionist Interests of the German Iron and Steel Industry, 1873-1879,\\" Journal of Economic History, March 1962, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 59-70 =Railways= Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist Friedrich List summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841: * as a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army. * It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation‚Ä¶. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market. * It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life. * It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.List quoted in John J. Lalor, ed. Cyclop√¶dia of Political Science (1881) 3:118; see Thomas Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck (1996) p 165 Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain‚Äôs. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France.Allan Mitchell, Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815-1914 (2000)J.

Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices for modern new methods, including use of new fertilizers and new tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914.J.A. Perkins, \\"The Agricultural Revolution in Germany 1850‚Äì1914,\\" Journal of European Economic History, (1981) 19#1 pp 71-119 Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory workers, especially from Germany's Polish districts.Barker, Modern Germany; her political and economic problems, her foreign and domestic policy, her ambitions, and the causes of her success (1907) pp 361-405.online =Chemicals= The BASF-chemical factories in Ludwigshafen, Germany, 1881 The economy continued to industrialize and urbanize, with heavy industry (coal and steel especially) becoming important in the Ruhr, and manufacturing growing in the cities, the Ruhr, and Silesia.Barker, Modern Germany; her political and economic problems, her foreign and domestic policy, her ambitions, and the causes of her success (1907) pp 502-20.online Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. Big businesses such as BASF and Bayer led the way in their production and distribution of artificial dyes and pharmaceuticals during the Wilhelmine era, leading to the German monopolisation of the global chemicals market at 90 percent of the entire share of international volumes of trade in chemical products by 1914.Cornelius Torp, \\"The Great Transformation: German Economy and Society 1850-1914\\", in Helmut Walser Smith (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Modern German History (2011), pp. 347-8 =Steel= Germany became Europe's leading steel-producing country in the late-19th century, thanks in large part to the protection from American and British competition afforded by tariffs and to cartels.Steven B. Webb, \\"Tariffs, Cartels, Technology, and Growth in the German Steel Industry, 1879 to 1914\\", Journal of Economic History Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jun., 1980), pp. 309-330 in JSTOR The leading firm was \\"Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp\\" run by the Krupp family.Harold James, Krupp: A History of the Legendary German Firm (Princeton U.P. 2012) The \\"German Steel Federation\\" was established in 1874. =Foreign direct investment= The end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century associates with the time of expansion in demand, the growth of the production capacity and the rise of exports to Germany. This in its turn stimulated the foreign direct investments (FDI) into the economics. Ten countries were considered the major investors, namely: Austria-Hungary, the UK, followed by France, USA, Italy, Russia, Poland (was a part of neighbouring empires), Switzerland, Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia (as a part of Austria-Hungary). Their aim was to get via FDI the access to raw material, and to get involved into the production and sales. The preferred methods of investments were via equity stakes, mergers and Greenfield investments. In order to implement the destination analysis of the FDI during this time frame mostly knowledge-capital model is used due to the predominant role of horizontal investments (or market-driven FDI). Moreover, there were found some evidence of the vertical investment structure (known as cost-driven FDI). To be more precise, when there were the wage differences between countries the FDI flows were higher to the low-wage ones. Major factors that influenced FDI were market environment (e.g. tariffs and market opening) and company size. Interestingly, cultural differences or distance between countries did not have major influence on FDI. Early 20th century The merger of four major firms into the Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steel Works) in 1926 was modeled on the U.S. Steel corporation in the U.S. The goal was to move beyond the limitations of the old cartel system by incorporating advances simultaneously inside a single corporation. The new company emphasized rationalization of management structures and modernization of the technology; it employed a multi-divisional structure and used return on investment as its measure of success.Alfred Reckendrees, \\"From Cartel Regulation to Monopolistic Control? The Founding of the German 'Steel Trust' in 1926 and its Effect on Market Regulation,\\" Business History, (July 2003) 45#3 pp 22-51, Whereas Britain's share of world trade had declined between 1880 and 1913 from 38.2 per cent to 30.2 per cent, Germany's share had increased in the same period from 17.2 per cent to 26.6 per cent.Michael Balfour, West Germany (London: Ernest Benn, 1968), p. 53. Between 1890 and 1913 German exports tripled and by 1913 Germany's share of world manufacturing production was 14.8 per cent, ahead of Britain's 13.6 per cent.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (London: Fontana, 1989), p. 271. By 1913 American and German exports dominated the world steel market, as Britain slipped to third place.Robert C. Allen, \\"International Competition in Iron and Steel, 1850-1913, Journal of Economic History, (Dec 1979) 39#4 pp 911-37 in JSTOR In 1914 German steel output was 17.6 million tons, larger than the combined output of Britain, France and Russia. Germany's coal production reached 277 million tons in 1914, not far behind Britain's 292 million tons and far ahead of Austria-Hungary's 47 million tons, France's 40 million tons and Russia's 36 million tons. In machinery, iron and steel and other industries, German firms avoided cut- throat competition and instead relied on trade associations. Germany was a world leader because of its prevailing \\"corporatist mentality\\", its strong bureaucratic tradition, and the encouragement of the government. These associations regulated competition and allowed small firms to function in the shadow of much larger companies.Gerald D. Feldman and Ulrich Nocken, \\"Trade Associations and Economic Power: Interest Group Development in the German Iron and Steel and Machine Building Industries, 1900-1933\\" Business History Review, (Winter 1975), 49#4 pp 413-45 in JSTOR =World War I= Unexpectedly Germany plunged into World War I (1914‚Äì1918). It rapidly mobilized its civilian economy for the war effort. The economy suffered under the British blockade, which cut off supplies.Feldman, Gerald D. \\"The Political and Social Foundations of Germany's Economic Mobilization, 1914-1916,\\" Armed Forces & Society (1976) 3#1 pp 121-145. online The impact of the blockade was gradual, with relatively little impact on German industry in the first couple of years.Philpott, 2014; p. 206-207 Mobilization and armament caused a short- lived but dramatic economic shock at the beginning of the conflict: unemployment spiked from 2.7% in July 1914 to 22.7% in September. The unemployment level thereafter fell dramatically, as war industry and recruitment placed a massive demand on manpower. Intervention by the government in the economy was also moderate at the beginning, because the war was anticipated to be brief. Securing materials for armaments production and the control of food markets were two areas where the German government was involved from the start of the conflict. Private corporations were created under the supervision of the government to oversee specified industries and manage the supply and distribution of foodstuffs. This began in November 1914 with the establishment of a wheat corporation. There were around 200 of these corporations by the end of the war, representing an unprecedented level of cooperation between government and the private sector. The insatiable demands on manpower led to yet more government intervention and triggered a massive redistribution of the workforce from \\"peacetime\\" industries to war industries and the military. High levels of conscription into the army threatened to deprive the armaments industry of workers, with the result that by 1916 the German government began exempting large numbers of otherwise eligible men from military service so they could remain as workers. Overall this balance between conscription and industry was handled efficiently, with Germany's industrial workforce shrinking by only 10%. About 1.2 million men were exempted in 1916, 740,000 of whom were fit to serve; by 1918 2.2 million men had been exempted from service, 1.3 million of whom were fit to serve. There was an exodus of workers from \\"peacetime\\" industries and agriculture into the better-paid war industries, which claimed 45% of the work force by 1918. The result was that \\"peacetime\\" industry declined by about 43% over the course of the war, claiming only 20% of the workforce by 1918. Germany exploited her own natural resources and those of her occupied territories to fill the import gap caused by the British blockade, while neutral neighbors like the Netherlands and the Scandinavian nations exported crucial foodstuffs like wheat to keep the German population fed. There were some commodities, like rubber, cotton, and nitrates (Saltpeter), which Germany could not easily substitute from within, and which she could not obtain from her neutral trading partners because the Allies classified them as contraband. The loss of nitrate imports, vital for the production of both explosives and fertilizers, proved disastrous for German agriculture. German chemical firms turned to producing synthetic nitrates, but output was only high enough to sustain the explosives industry. Without fertilizer, agricultural productivity declined dramatically. The freezing 'Turnip Winter' of 1916-17 only compounded the growing subsistence problem; wheat and potato crops failed and Germans had to turn to turnips to satisfy their nutritional needs, a vegetable previously used for livestock feed.Ernst H. Starling. \\"The Food Supply of Germany During the War\\". Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, vol. 83, no. 2 (March 1920), 233. The cumulative impact of the First World War on the German economy was disastrous. The Germany economy shrank by approximately one-third during the war, with overall industrial production down by 40% compared to pre-war levels. =Weimar Republic= British economist John Maynard Keynes denounced the 1919 Treaty of Versailles as ruinous to German and global prosperity. In his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace.Antony. Lentin, \\"Germany: a New Carthage?,\\" History Today (Jan. 2012) 62#1 pp 20-27 Keynes said the Treaty was a \\"Carthaginian peace\\", a misguided attempt to destroy Germany on behalf of French revanchism, rather than to follow the fairer principles for a lasting peace set out in President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Germany had accepted at the armistice. Keynes argued the sums being asked of Germany in reparations were many times more than it was possible for Germany to pay, and that these would produce drastic instability. French economist √âtienne Mantoux disputed that analysis in The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes (1946). More recently economists have argued that the restriction of Germany to a small army in the 1920s saved it so much money it could afford the reparations payments.Max Hantke and Mark Spoerer, \\"The imposed gift of Versailles: the fiscal effects of restricting the size of Germany's armed forces, 1924-9,\\" Economic History Review (2010) 63#4 pp 849-864. online In reality, the total German Reparation payments actually made were far smaller than anyone expected. The total came to 20 billion German gold marks, worth about $5 billion US dollars or ¬£1 billion British pounds. German reparations payments ended in 1931.Sally Marks, \\"The Myths of Reparations,\\" Central European History (1978) 11#3 pp 231-55 in JSTOR The war and the treaty were followed by the Hyper-inflation of the early 1920s that wreaked havoc on Germany's social structure and political stability. During that inflation, the value of the nation's currency, the Papiermark, collapsed from 8.9 per US$1 in 1918 to 4.2 trillion per US$1 by November 1923. Prosperity reigned 1923‚Äì29, supported by large bank loans from New York. By 1929 GDP per capita was 12 per cent higher than in 1913 and between 1924 and 1929 exports doubled.Balfour, West Germany, pp. 85‚Äì86. Net investment reached a high average figure of nearly 12 per cent.Balfour, West Germany, p. 86. However, unemployment was over two millions by the winter of 1928‚Äì29. The Great Depression struck Germany hard, starting already in the last months of 1927 .Temin, Peter. \\"The beginning of the Depression in Germany.\\" The Economic History Review 24.2 (1971): 240-248. Foreign lending, especially by New York banks, ceased around 1930. Unemployment soared, especially in larger cities, fueling extremism and violence on the far right and far left, as the centre of the political spectrum weakened. Capital flows finally reversed in 1931 and a currency crisis ensued.Ferguson, Thomas, and Peter Temin. \\"Made in Germany: the German currency crisis of July 1931.\\" Research in Economic History. (2003), 1-53. online version At the same time as Germany was hit by a banking crisis, when the second largest German bank, the Danat-Bank, failed. At the peak of the crisis the United States, with the Hoover Moratorium, unilaterally declared a one-year moratorium on all reparations and war debts. Germany had paid about one-eighth of its war reparations when they were suspended in 1932 by the Lausanne Conference of 1932. The failure of major banks in Germany and Austria in 1931 worsened the worldwide banking crisis.Christopher Kopper, \\"New perspectives on the 1931 banking crisis in Germany and Central Europe,\\" Business History, (2011), 53#2 pp 216-229 Germany was among the countries most severely affected by the great depression because its recovery and rationalization of major industries was financed by unsustainable foreign lending. War reparation obligations reduced investment propensity and, perhaps most importantly, the government implemented a rigid austerity policy that resulted in deflation.Edward W, Bennett, Germany and the diplomacy of the financial crisis, 1931 (1962) Online free to borrow. As unemployment reached very high levels, the national socialists accumulated government power and began to pursue their inhuman policies against the Jewish minority, political leftists and many other groups. After being elected, the national socialists undertook a series of rapid steps to abolish democracy. Their trade policy in Germany consisted of an autarkic policy regime that aimed to cancel all imports, such as foodstuffs, that could be replaced with domestic substitutes or raw materials for the consumer-oriented industries. Only imports of iron ore and similar items were considered necessary because a main aim of the government was to strengthen the production capacity of military products. Both the persecuted and non-persecuted German groups suffered from these autarkic and trade-restraining policies. Nazi economy IG Farben factory in Monowitz (near Auschwitz), 1941 During the Hitler era (1933‚Äì45), the economy developed a hothouse prosperity, supported with high government subsidies to those sectors that tended to give Germany military power and economic autarky, that is, economic independence from the global economy.Adam Tooze, The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy (2008) During the war itself the German economy was sustained by the exploitation of conquered territories and people. \\"The economic recovery in the Third Reich, as measured by GDP, is well documented; real GDP grew by some 55% between 1933 and 1937.‚Äù US Air Force photograph of the destruction in central Berlin in July 1945 Physical capital in the occupied territories was destroyed by the war, insufficient reinvestment and maintenance, whereas the industrial capacity of Germany increased substantially until the end of the war despite heavy bombing. (However, much of this capacity was useless after the war because it specialized in armament production.) With the loss of the war, the country entered into the period known as Stunde Null (\\"Zero Hour\\"), when Germany lay in ruins and the society had to be rebuilt from scratch. Post-World War II The first several years after World War II were years of bitter penury for the Germans. Seven million forced laborers left for their own land, but about 14 million Germans came in from the East, living for years in dismal camps. It took nearly a decade for all the German POWs to return. In the West, farm production fell, food supplies were cut off from eastern Germany (controlled by the Soviets) and food shipments extorted from conquered lands ended. The standard of living fell to levels not seen in a century, and food was always in short supply. High inflation made savings (and debts) lose 99% of their value, while the black market distorted the economy. In the East, the Soviets crushed dissent and imposed another police state, often employing ex-Nazis in the dreaded Stasi.Deutsche Welle, Staff, \\"Book Claims Stasi Employed Nazis as Spies\\" Deutsche Welle online Oct. 31, 2005 The Soviets extracted about 23% of the East German GNP for reparations, while in the West reparations were a minor factor.Peter Liberman, Does Conquest Pay? The Exploitation of Occupied Industrial Societies (1996) p 147 Even while the Marshall Plan was being implemented, the dismantling of ostensibly German industry continued; and in 1949 Konrad Adenauer, an opponent to Hitler's regime and the head of the Christian Democratic Union, wrote to the Allies requesting the end of industrial dismantling, citing the inherent contradiction between encouraging industrial growth and removing factories, and also the unpopularity of the policy.Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance (Oxford 1989) p259 Adenauer had been released from prison, only to discover that the Soviets had effectively divided Europe with Germany divided even further. Support for dismantling was by this time coming predominantly from the French, and the Petersberg Agreement of November 1949 greatly reduced the levels of deindustrialization, though dismantling of minor factories continued until 1951.Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance (Oxford 1989) p260 The first \\"level of industry\\" plan, signed by the Allies on March 29, 1946, had stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants.Henry C. Wallich. Mainsprings of the German Revival (1955) pg. 348. Marshall Plan played a huge role in post-war recovery for Europe in general. 1948, conditions were improving, European workers exceeded by 20 percent from the earning from the west side. Thanks to the Plan, during 1952, it went up 35 percent of the industrial and agricultural.Manfred Knapp, et al. ‚ÄúReconstruction and West-Integration: The Impact of the Marshall Plan on Germany.‚Äù Zeitschrift F√ºr Die Gesamte Staatswissenschaft / Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics 137#3 (1981), pp. 415‚Äì433. online in English In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production. The maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year, equivalent to 25% of the pre-war production level.\\"Cornerstone of Steel\\", TIME, January 21, 1946 The UK, in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located, had argued for a more limited capacity reduction by placing the production ceiling at 12 million tons of steel per year, but had to submit to the will of the US, France and the Soviet Union (which had argued for a 3 million ton limit). Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled. Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known at the height of the Great Depression (1932).Cost of Defeat, TIME, April 8, 1946 Consequently, car production was set to 10% of pre-war levels, and the manufacture of other commodities was reduced as well.The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report 3 Herbert Hoover, March 1947 pg. 8 The first \\"German level of industry\\" plan was subsequently followed by a number of new ones, the last signed in 1949. By 1950, after the virtual completion of the by then much watered-down \\"level of industry\\" plans, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in western Germany and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6,700,000 tons.Frederick H.

He was given his chance by American officials, who saw that many of his ideas coincided with their own. Erhard abolished the Reichsmark and then created a new currency, the Deutsche Mark, on 21 June 1948, with the concurrence of the Western Allies but also taking advantage of the opportunity to abolish most Nazi and occupation rules and regulations. It established the foundations of the West German economy and of the West German state.David R. Henderson, \\"German Economic Miracle.\\" The concise encyclopedia of economics (2008) online.

Mierzejewski, Ludwig Erhard: A Biography (U of North Carolina Press, 2005). =Marshall Plan and productivity = The Marshall Plan was implemented in West Germany 1948-1950 as a way to modernize business procedures and utilize the best practices. The Marshall Plan made it possible for West Germany to return quickly to its traditional pattern of industrial production with a strong export sector. Without the plan, agriculture would have played a larger role in the recovery period, which itself would have been longer.Gerd Hardach, \\"The Marshall Plan in Germany, 1948-1952.\\" Journal of European Economic History 16.3 (1987): 433‚Äì485.

Mary Nolan, Visions of Modernity: American Business and the Modernization of Germany (1994) After 1950, Germany overtook Britain in comparative productivity levels for the whole economy, primarily as a result of trends in services rather than trends in industry. Britain's historic lead in productivity of its services sector was based on external economies of scale in a highly urbanized economy with an international colonial orientation. On the other hand, the low productivity in Germany was caused by the underdevelopment of services generally, especially in rural areas that comprised a much larger sector. As German farm employment declined sharply after 1950 thanks to mechanization, catching-up occurred in services. This process was aided by a sharp increase in human and physical capital accumulation, a pro-growth government policy, and the effective utilization of the education sector to create a more productive work force.Stephen Broadberry, \\"Explaining Anglo-German Productivity Differences in Services since 1870,\\" European Review of Economic History, Dec 2004, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp 229-262  Social market economy  The German economy self-defines as a \\"soziale Marktwirtschaft,\\" or \\"social market economy,\\" to emphasize that the system as it has developed after World War II has both a material and a social‚Äîor human‚Äîdimension. The term \\"market\\" is of significance, as free enterprise is considered to be main driving force for a healthy economy. The state was to play only a minor role in the new West German economy, such as the protection of the competitive environment from monopolistic or oligopolistic tendencies‚Äîincluding its own. The term \\"social\\" is stressed because West Germans wanted an economy that would not only help the wealthy but also care for the workers and others who might not prove able to cope with the strenuous competitive demands of a market economy. The term \\"social\\" was chosen rather than \\"socialist\\" to distinguish their system from those in which the state claimed the right to direct the economy or to intervene in it. Beyond these principles of the social market economy, but linked to it, comes a more traditional German concept, that of Ordnung, which can be directly translated to mean order but which really means an economy, society, and policy that are structured but not dictatorial. The founders of the social market economy insisted that Denken in Ordnungen‚Äîto think in terms of systems of order‚Äîwas essential. They also spoke of Ordoliberalism because the essence of the concept is that this must be a freely chosen order, not a command order. Over time, the term \\"social\\" in the social market economy began to take on a life of its own. It moved the West German economy toward an extensive social welfare system that has become one of the most expensive in the world. Moreover, the West German federal government and the states (L√§nder ; sing., Land ) began to compensate for irregularities in economic cycles and for shifts in world production by beginning to shelter and support some sectors and industries. In an even greater departure from the Erhard tradition, the government became an instrument for the preservation of existing industries rather than a force for renewal. In the 1970s, the state assumed an ever more important role in the economy. During the 1980s, Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried to reduce that state role, and he succeeded in part, but German unification again compelled the German government to assume a stronger role in the economy. Thus, the contradiction between the terms \\"social\\" and \\"market\\" has remained an element for debate in Germany. Given the internal contradiction in its philosophy, the German economy is both conservative and dynamic. It is conservative in the sense that it draws on the part of the German tradition that envisages some state role in the economy and a cautious attitude toward investment and risk-taking. It is dynamic in the sense that it is directed toward growth‚Äîeven if that growth may be slow and steady rather than spectacular. It tries to combine the virtues of a market system with the virtues of a social welfare system.  Economic miracle and beyond  The economic reforms and the new West German system received powerful support from a number of sources: investment funds under the European Recovery Program, more commonly known as the Marshall Plan; the stimulus to German industry provided by the diversion of other Western resources for Korean War production; and the German readiness to work hard for low wages until productivity had risen. But the essential component of success was the revival of confidence brought on by Erhard's reforms and by the new currency. The West German boom that began in 1950 was truly memorable. The growth rate of industrial production was 25.0 percent in 1950 and 18.1 percent in 1951. Growth continued at a high rate for most of the 1950s, despite occasional slowdowns. By 1960 industrial production had risen to two-and-one-half times the level of 1950 and far beyond any that the Nazis had reached during the 1930s in all of Germany. GDP rose by two-thirds during the same decade. The number of persons employed rose from 13.8 million in 1950 to 19.8 million in 1960, and the unemployment rate fell from 10.3 percent to 1.2 percent. Labor also benefited in due course from the boom. Although wage demands and pay increases had been modest at first, wages and salaries rose over 80 percent between 1949 and 1955, catching up with growth. West German social programs were given a considerable boost in 1957, just before a national election, when the government decided to initiate a number of social programs and to expand others. In 1957 West Germany gained a new central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, generally called simply the Bundesbank, which succeeded the Bank deutscher L√§nder and was given much more authority over monetary policy. That year also saw the establishment of the Bundeskartellamt (Federal Cartel Office), designed to prevent the return of German monopolies and cartels. Six years later, in 1963, the Bundestag, the lower house of Germany's parliament, at Erhard's urging established the Council of Economic Experts to provide objective evaluations on which to base German economic policy. The West German economy did not grow as fast or as consistently in the 1960s as it had during the 1950s, in part because such a torrid pace could not be sustained, in part because the supply of fresh labor from East Germany was cut off by the Berlin Wall, built in 1961, and in part because the Bundesbank became disturbed about potential overheating and moved several times to slow the pace of growth. Erhard, who had succeeded Konrad Adenauer as chancellor, was voted out of office in December 1966, largely‚Äîalthough not entirely‚Äîbecause of the economic problems of the Federal Republic. He was replaced by the Grand Coalition consisting of the Christian Democratic Union (Christlich Demokratische Union‚ÄîCDU), its sister party the Christian Social Union (Christlich-Soziale Union‚ÄîCSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands‚ÄîSPD) under Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger of the CDU. Under the pressure of the slowdown, the new West German Grand Coalition government abandoned Erhard's broad laissez-faire orientation. The new minister for economics, Karl Schiller, argued strongly for legislation that would give the federal government and his ministry greater authority to guide economic policy. In 1967 the Bundestag passed the Law for Promoting Stability and Growth, known as the Magna Carta of medium-term economic management. That law, which remains in effect although never again applied as energetically as in Schiller's time, provided for coordination of federal, Land, and local budget plans in order to give fiscal policy a stronger impact. The law also set a number of optimistic targets for the four basic standards by which West German economic success was henceforth to be measured: currency stability, economic growth, employment levels, and trade balance. Those standards became popularly known as the magisches Viereck, the \\"magic rectangle\\" or the \\"magic polygon.\\" Schiller followed a different concept from Erhard's. He was one of the rare German Keynesians, and he brought to his new tasks the unshakable conviction that government had both the obligation and the capacity to shape economic trends and to smooth out and even eliminate the business cycle. Schiller's chosen formula was Globalsteuerung, or global guidance, a process by which government would not intervene in the details of the economy but would establish broad guidelines that would foster uninterrupted noninflationary growth. Schiller's success in the Grand Coalition helped to give the SPD an electoral victory in 1969 and a chance to form a new coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei‚ÄîFDP) under Willy Brandt. The SPD-FDP coalition expanded the West German social security system, substantially increasing the size and cost of the social budget. Social program costs grew by over 10 percent a year during much of the 1970s, introducing into the budget an unalterable obligation that reduced fiscal flexibility (although Schiller and other Keynesians believed that it would have an anticyclical effect). This came back to haunt Schiller as well as every German government since then. Schiller himself had to resign in 1972 when the West German and global economies were in a downturn and when all his ideas did not seem able to revive West German prosperity. Willy Brandt himself resigned two years later. Helmut Schmidt, Brandt's successor, was intensely interested in economics but also faced great problems, including the dramatic upsurge in oil prices of 1973-74. West Germany's GDP in 1975 fell by 1.4 percent (in constant prices), the first time since the founding of the FRG that it had fallen so sharply. The West German trade balance also fell as global demand declined and as the terms of trade deteriorated because of the rise in petroleum prices. By 1976 the worst was over. West German growth resumed, and the inflation rate began to decline. Although neither reached the favorable levels that had come to be taken for granted during the 1950s and early 1960s, they were accepted as tolerable after the turbulence of the previous years. Schmidt began to be known as a Macher (achiever), and the government won reelection in 1976. Schmidt's success led him and his party to claim that they had built Modell Deutschland (the German model). But the economy again turned down and, despite efforts to stimulate growth by government deficits, failed to revive quickly. It was only by mid-1978 that Schmidt and the Bundesbank were able to bring the economy into balance. After that, the economy continued expanding through 1979 and much of 1980, helping Schmidt win reelection in 1980. But the upturn proved to be uneven and unrewarding, as the problems of the mid-1970s rapidly returned. By early 1981, Schmidt faced the worst possible situation: growth fell and unemployment rose, but inflation did not abate. By late 1982, Schmidt's coalition government collapsed as the FDP withdrew to join a coalition led by Helmut Kohl, the leader of the CDU/CSU. He began to direct what was termed the ' (turning or reversal). The government proceeded to implement new policies to reduce the government role in the economy and within a year won a popular vote in support of the new course. Within its broad policy, the new government had several main objectives: to reduce the federal deficit by cutting expenditures as well as taxes, to reduce government restrictions and regulations, and to improve the flexibility and performance of the labor market. The government also carried through a series of privatization measures, selling almost DM10 billion (for value of the deutsche mark‚Äîsee Glossary) in shares of such diverse state-owned institutions as VEBA, VIAG, Volkswagen, Lufthansa, and Salzgitter. Through all these steps, the state role in the West German economy declined from 52 percent to 46 percent of GDP between 1982 and 1990, according to Bundesbank statistics. Although the policies of the ' changed the mood of the West German economy and reinstalled a measure of confidence, progress came unevenly and haltingly. During most of the 1980s, the figures on growth and inflation improved but slowly, and the figures on unemployment barely moved at all. There was little job growth until the end of the decade. When the statistics did change, however, even modestly, it was at least in the right direction. Nonetheless, it also remained true that West German growth did not again reach the levels that it had attained in the early years of the Federal Republic. There had been a decline in the growth rate since the 1950s, an upturn in unemployment since the 1960s, and a gradual increase in inflation except during or after a severe downturn. Global economic statistics also showed a decline in West German output and vitality. They showed that the West German share of total world production had grown from 6.6 percent in 1965 to 7.9 percent by 1975. Twelve years later, in 1987, however, it had fallen to 7.4 percent, largely because of the more rapid growth of Japan and other Asian states. Even adding the estimated GDP of the former East Germany at its peak before unification would not have brought the all-German share above 8.2 percent by 1989 and would leave all of Germany with barely a greater share of world production than West Germany alone had reached fifteen years earlier. It was only in the late 1980s that West Germany's economy finally began to grow more rapidly. The growth rate for West German GDP rose to 3.7 percent in 1988 and 3.6 percent in 1989, the highest levels of the decade. The unemployment rate also fell to 7.6 percent in 1989, despite an influx of workers from abroad. Thus, the results of the late 1980s appeared to vindicate the West German supply-side revolution. Tax rate reductions had led to greater vitality and revenues. Although the cumulative public-sector deficit had gone above the DM1 trillion level, the public sector was growing more slowly than before. The year 1989 was the last year of the West German economy as a separate and separable institution. From 1990 the positive and negative distortions generated by German reunification set in, and the West German economy began to reorient itself toward economic and political union with what had been East Germany. The economy turned gradually and massively from its primarily West European and global orientation toward an increasingly intense concentration on the requirements and the opportunities of unification.  German reunification and its aftermath  Germany invested over 2 trillion marks in the rehabilitation of the former East Germany, helping it to transition to a market economy and cleaning up the environmental degradation. By 2011 the results were mixed, with slow economic development in the East, in sharp contrast to the rapid economic growth in both west and southern Germany. Unemployment was much higher in the East, often over 15%. Economists Snower and Merkl (2006) suggest that the malaise was prolonged by all the social and economic help from the German government, pointing especially to bargaining by proxy, high unemployment benefits and welfare entitlements, and generous job- security provisions.Dennis J.

It is located 3 miles due west of Chepstow, 5 miles (8 km) by road. The village stands around 500 feet (154 m) above sea level, and has extensive views of the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel. The population of the village and the conjoined village of Mynydd-bach was 657 in 2011. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000421 History Before the Norman invasion of Wales, the Shirenewton area formed part of the forest of Wentwood (). At the time of the Domesday Book, it was part of the lands at Caldicot which were held by Durand, the Sheriff of Gloucester. Durand and his successor as sheriff, his nephew Walter FitzRoger also known as Walter de Gloucester, had part of the forest cleared around the year 1100, and established a small settlement which was known as \\"Sheriff's Newton (or New Town)\\" or, in Latin, Nova Villa. History of Shirenewton Church The manor then became known as Caldecot-cum-Newton, and in some documents the village was called Newton Netherwent. \\"Netherwent\\" is the English name given to the Welsh cantref of Gwent-is-coed (Gwent beneath the wood, i.e. Wentwood), with \\"-went\\" deriving from the Roman town of Venta which became Caerwent. The name \\"Sheriff's Newton\\" became contracted over the years into Shirenewton. After Walter retired to become a monk at Llanthony Priory, he was followed as Sheriff by his son, Milo Fitzwalter (Miles de Gloucester), who became Earl of Hereford and Lord High Constable of England in 1141. The area north west of the village became known as the Earl's Wood about that time, hence modern Earlswood. The Mounton Brook runs through the parish, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries provided the water power to operate five paper mills in the Mynydd-bach area - White Mill, Itton Mill, Dyer's Mill, Itton Court Mill, and Pandy Mill. These made brown and blue packing paper, using rags, straw and old rope as raw materials. There were three more mills just downstream at Mounton.Ivor Waters, Mounton Valley Paper Mills, Chepstow Society, 1978 =Shirenewton Hall= The Grade II listed building Shirenewton Hall,\\"¬£5m hall could be going for a singer\\" at walesonline.co.uk once the residence of botanist and meteorologist Edward Joseph Lowe, is a large residence at the top of the hill, commanding extensive views of the Severn Estuary and beyond.

The village today There has recently been some controversy over the Welsh language name for the village. This has been confirmed by the Place Names Standardisation Committee of the Welsh Language Board to be Drenewydd Gelli-farch, which is normally translated to \\"new settlement at the stallion's grove\\", although one of the roads leading into Shirenewton still has the Welsh name as 'Trenewydd Gelli Farch'. According to the 1901 Kelly's Directory, the Welsh name \\"appears to have been but seldom used\\".Kelly's 1901 Directory of Monmouthshire on Shirenewton Mynydd-bach is a community separated by the width of a single field from Shirenewton. The name means, in Welsh, \\"little hill\\". The 1892 Chepstow Directory has an entry for Shirenewton, showing that it had a population of around 650 people at that time. The current population is unknown, but the number of houses in the village has increased markedly in recent years. Many attempts have been made to extend the village, to add small housing estates, but most have come up short due to the village boundaries, and the desire of the locals to keep the village as it is. Shirenewton, although relatively small, has three pubs: The Carpenters Arms, The Tredegar Arms and The Huntsman Hotel. A fourth, The Tan House, closed in Summer 2011 and was empty till being sold in June 2012. The future use of the premises is at the time of writing, not known. Until recently it sported a small village shop (SPAR) which closed in January 2007 and is currently for sale. This took the place of the original 5 Bells shop which shut in the early 1990s, and Ostlers Garage and Shop which closed in the late 1990s. Shirenewton also sported a small village Post Office that unfortunately shut down several years ago. The village also has a modern primary school called Shirenewton Primary that was built in 1985. This lies between Shirenewton and Mynydd-bach, and is situated in large open playing fields. The school hosts seven classes, three infant classes, and four junior. Shirenewton's large golf course closed in May 2005 and the site has since been developed for luxury housing, although part of the golf course has been kept as a conservation area. The golf course encompassed the site of the abandoned manor of Dinham, which also included a small castle, now left in unrecognisable ruins. \\"The Grondra\\", also located in the village, is considered to be one of the finest 18th century country houses in Monmouthshire.

Known in local dialect as Nitten, or Nitten by the Bing (), it became Scotland's largest mining village in the 1890s, with the sinking of the Lady Victoria Colliery and a shaft over 1600 feet deep. This closed in 1981 but today houses the National Mining Museum, an Anchor Point of ERIH - The European Route of Industrial Heritage. From its humble beginnings in 1843 with 100 souls, the church in Newtongrange grew to see its roll rise to over 1,000 in the 1950s. On 16 January 2003, the parishes of Newtongrange and Newbattle united to form a new Newbattle parish. The new parish is in fact that which existed before the Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843. Newtongrange is known for its yearly Brass in the Park event, where brass bands play live over three days. The Newtongrange Silver Band became Scottish Brass Band Champions in 2005, and represented Scotland at the European Brass Band Championships in 2006. It is also where the radio station, 'Black Diamond FM' is based. They have a junior football team, Newtongrange Star, who play at New Victoria Park in the village. The original Victoria Park was used as a speedway training track in the 1950 and the trainees raced as Newtongrange Rockets. The sport was revived briefly in 1970 and in 1973. The team of 1970 was known as Newtongrange Saints while in 1973 the team were known as Edinburgh Monarchs. Victoria Park's track become the home to stock car racing before its closure and redevelopment for housing. Newtongrange is home to Newtongrange Primary School. Now at the limits of its capacity, it has been proposed that a new primary school be built, along with several new housing schemes. The most recent addition to Newtongrange's housing stock was planned and constructed by the Mining Museum, and consisted of two streets; Colliery Crescent and Colliery View, both named by school pupil Kerry Morrison. The new Newtongrange railway station on the Borders Railway has been built near Murderdean Road, giving rail access to the Borders and Edinburgh Waverley station. The Dean Tavern Newtongrange is also home to the Dean Tavern, an example of a Gothenburg pub. The premise of Gothenburg pubs was that they were not to be attractive or welcoming, in order to discourage drinking and the sales of spirits was not to be encouraged. The shareholders of the trust were to receive a maximum return of 5% annually and all other profits were to be used to benefit the local community.

It differs from other digital adders in that it outputs two (or more) numbers, and the answer of the original summation can be achieved by adding these outputs together. A carry save adder is typically used in a binary multiplier, since a binary multiplier involves addition of more than two binary numbers after multiplication. A big adder implemented using this technique will usually be much faster than conventional addition of those numbers. Motivation Consider the sum: 12345678 + 87654322 = 100000000 Using basic arithmetic, we calculate right to left, \\"8 + 2 = 0, carry 1\\", \\"7 + 2 + 1 = 0, carry 1\\", \\"6 + 3 + 1 = 0, carry 1\\", and so on to the end of the sum. Although we know the last digit of the result at once, we cannot know the first digit until we have gone through every digit in the calculation, passing the carry from each digit to the one on its left. Thus adding two n-digit numbers has to take a time proportional to n, even if the machinery we are using would otherwise be capable of performing many calculations simultaneously. In electronic terms, using bits (binary digits), this means that even if we have n one-bit adders at our disposal, we still have to allow a time proportional to n to allow a possible carry to propagate from one end of the number to the other. Until we have done this, # We do not know the result of the addition. # We do not know whether the result of the addition is larger or smaller than a given number (for instance, we do not know whether it is positive or negative). A carry look-ahead adder can reduce the delay. In principle the delay can be reduced so that it is proportional to log n, but for large numbers this is no longer the case, because even when carry look-ahead is implemented, the distances that signals have to travel on the chip increase in proportion to n, and propagation delays increase at the same rate. Once we get to the 512-bit to 2048-bit number sizes that are required in public-key cryptography, carry look-ahead is not of much help. The basic concept The idea of delaying carry resolution until the end, or saving carries, is due to John von Neumann. Here is an example of a binary sum of 3 long binary numbers: 10111010101011011111000000001101 (a) + 11011110101011011011111011101111 (b) + 10010010101101110101001101010010 (c) Conventional way to do it would be to first compute (a+b), and then compute ((a+b)+c). Carry-save arithmetic works by abandoning any kind of carry propagation. It computes the sum digit by digit, as: 10111010101011011111000000001101 + 11011110101011011011111011101111 + 00010010101101110101001101010010 = 21132130303123132223112112112222 The notation is unconventional, but the result is still unambiguous. Here, the result will be described as the sum of 2 binary numbers: 01110110101101110001110110110000 and 100110101010110111110010010011110 Now these 2 numbers can be sent to a carry-propagate adder which will output the result. This was very advantageous from a delay (computation-time) perspective. If you were to add these 3 numbers using conventional methods, it would take you 2 carry-propagate adder delays to get to the answer. If you use the carry-save technique, you require one only 1 carry-propagate adder delay and 1 full-adder delay (which is much lower than a carry-propagate delay) and. Thus, CSA adders are typically very fast. Carry-save accumulators Supposing that we have two bits of storage per digit, we can use a redundant binary representation, storing the values 0, 1, 2, or 3 in each digit position. It is therefore obvious that one more binary number can be added to our carry-save result without overflowing our storage capacity: but then what? The key to success is that at the moment of each partial addition we add three bits: * 0 or 1, from the number we are adding. * 0 if the digit in our store is 0 or 2, or 1 if it is 1 or 3. * 0 if the digit to its right is 0 or 1, or 1 if it is 2 or 3. To put it another way, we are taking a carry digit from the position on our right, and passing a carry digit to the left, just as in conventional addition; but the carry digit we pass to the left is the result of the previous calculation and not the current one. In each clock cycle, carries only have to move one step along, and not n steps as in conventional addition. Because signals don't have to move as far, the clock can tick much faster. .. There is still a need to convert the result to binary at the end of a calculation, which effectively just means letting the carries travel all the way through the number just as in a conventional adder. But if we have done 512 additions in the process of performing a 512-bit multiplication, the cost of that final conversion is effectively split across those 512 additions, so each addition bears 1/512 of the cost of that final \\"conventional\\" addition. Drawbacks At each stage of a carry-save addition, # We know the result of the addition at once. # We still do not know whether the result of the addition is larger or smaller than a given number (for instance, we do not know whether it is positive or negative). This latter point is a drawback when using carry-save adders to implement modular multiplication (multiplication followed by division, keeping the remainder only). If we cannot know whether the intermediate result is greater or less than the modulus, how can we know whether to subtract the modulus? Montgomery multiplication, which depends on the rightmost digit of the result, is one solution; though rather like carry- save addition itself, it carries a fixed overhead, so that a sequence of Montgomery multiplications saves time but a single one does not. Fortunately exponentiation, which is effectively a sequence of multiplications, is the most common operation in public-key cryptography. Careful error analysis allows a choice to be made about subtracting the modulus even though we don't know for certain whether the result of the addition is big enough to warrant the subtraction. For this to work, it is necessary for the circuit design to be able to add ‚àí2, ‚àí1, 0, +1 or +2 times the modulus. The advantage over Montgomery multiplication is that there is no fixed overhead attached to each sequence of multiplications. Technical details The carry-save unit consists of n full adders, each of which computes a single sum and carry bit based solely on the corresponding bits of the three input numbers. Given the three n-bit numbers a, b, and c, it produces a partial sum ps and a shift- carry sc: :ps_i = a_i oplus b_i oplus c_i, :sc_i = (a_i wedge b_i) vee (a_i wedge c_i) vee (b_i wedge c_i). The entire sum can then be computed by: # Shifting the carry sequence sc left by one place. # Appending a 0 to the front (most significant bit) of the partial sum sequence ps. # Using a ripple carry adder to add these two together and produce the resulting (n + 1)-bit value.

In Major League Baseball (MLB) he was a first baseman and outfielder, and played for three different American League (AL) franchises between 1964 and 1977. He was the son of longtime Cleveland Indians catcher Jim Hegan. Early years A graduate of Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland, Hegan attended College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, on a football and baseball scholarship. In August 1961, he signed with the New York Yankees after being offered contracts by 15 major league teams. Hegan later continued his college education at John Carroll University in Cleveland. Hegan played for multiple minor league teams within the Yankees organization, both before and after his major league debut. He spent the 1962 season with the Class D Fort Lauderdale Yankees, 1963 with the Class A Idaho Falls Yankees, parts of 1964 and 1965 with the Class AA Columbus Confederate Yankees, parts of 1965 and 1966 with the Class AAA Toledo Mud Hens, and 1968 with the Class AAA Syracuse Chiefs. Major league career =New York Yankees= Hegan began his major league career with the New York Yankees in 1964, appearing in five games late in the regular season; he was hitless in five at bats. He was added to the Yankees' roster for the 1964 World Series, replacing the injured Tony Kubek. In the series, which the Yankees lost in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals, Hegan appeared as a substitute in three games; he was hitless in one at bat, with one walk and one run scored. Hegan played 13 games with the Yankees in 1966, batting .205, and 68 games in 1967, batting .136. In June 1968, the Yankees sold his contract to the Seattle Pilots, an expansion team being added to MLB for the 1969 season. =Seattle Pilots= Hegan played 95 games for the Pilots in 1969, batting .292 with eight home runs and 37 RBIs. Hegan hit the first home run in franchise history, in his first at-bat with the team, on April 8. He was selected for the 1969 All-Star Game, but due to an injury was replaced by teammate Don Mincher on the AL roster. =Milwaukee Brewers= After the 1969 season, the Pilots franchise was sold and the team became the Milwaukee Brewers. Hegan played in 148 games for the Brewers during the 1970 season, batting .244 with 11 home runs and 52 RBIs. During the 1970 season, Hegan started an error-less streak as a first basemen, which would last for 178 games ‚Äì it stood as an American League record until it was broken by Kevin Youkilis on September 7, 2007. Midway through the 1971 season, Hegan was batting .221 when his contract was sold to the Oakland Athletics. =Oakland Athletics= 1972 Oakland Athletics #20 Mike Hegan Game Worn Alternate Jersey During the second half of the 1971 season, Hegan appeared in 65 games for Oakland, mostly as a pinch hitter or defensive replacement; he batted 13-for-55 (.236). In 1972, Hegan appeared in 98 regular season games, batting 26-for-79 (.329). In the 1972 World Series, the Athletics defeated the Cincinnati Reds in seven games; Hegan appeared in six games, but was hitless in five at bats. In 1973, Hegan was with Oakland until mid-August, batting 13-for-71 (.183) in 75 games played. On August 18, Oakland sent him to the Yankees for future considerations. =New York Yankees (second stint)= Hegan was the Yankees' regular first baseman for the remainder of the 1973 season; appearing in 37 games he hit 36-for-131 (.275) with six home runs and 14 RBIs. His father, Jim Hegan, was the Yankees' bullpen coach for manager Ralph Houk at the time. On September 30, 1973, Hegan was the last batter in the original Yankee Stadium before its mid-70s renovation. Hegan was with the Yankees in 1974 through mid-May, appearing in 18 games and batting 12-for-53 (.226). On May 13, the Yankees sold his contract to the Brewers. =Milwaukee Brewers (second stint)= During his second stint with the Brewers (May 1974 through July 1977), Hegan appeared in a total of 297 games, batting .239 with 19 home runs and 88 RBIs. On September 3, 1976, he became the first Brewer to hit for the cycle, in an 11‚Äì2 win over the Detroit Tigers. Hegan's major league career ended when he was released by the Brewers on July 15, 1977. In a total of 12 major league seasons, Hegan played in 966 games, batting .242 with 53 home runs and 229 RBIs. Defensively, he recorded a .995 fielding percentage at first base and an overall .993 fielding percentage. Broadcasting After his retirement from baseball as a player, Hegan spent the next twelve seasons as a television color commentator for the Brewers. In 1989, he was hired by the Cleveland Indians, and served as a commentator for the team on both radio and television for the next 23 seasons. He retired after the 2011 season, although on May 23, 2012, he filled in as commentator for a game against the Detroit Tigers. Personal life Hegan was inducted to the St. Ignatius High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1989, and was a 2011 inductee of the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame. After his retirement as a broadcaster, Hegan took a role with the Indians as an alumni ambassador. He died on December 25, 2013, in his home in Hilton Head, South Carolina, due to heart failure at the age of 71.

He became the Guthrie Theatre's artistic director in 1995 and has directed productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Playboy of the Western World, Much Ado About Nothing, The Importance of Being Earnest, Julius Caesar, Twelfth Night, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and Amadeus. He directed Hamlet, the Guthrie's last production in its original location next to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Hamlet was also the first play produced by the Guthrie in 1963, directed by Sir Tyrone Guthrie himself. Dowling's first production at the theater's new location was The Real Thing by Tom Stoppard. As part of the 2007/2008 season, he directed the American premiere of The Home Place by Brian Friel and in the 2009/2010 season, he directed and performed in Friel's play Faith Healer. Following the announcement of the 2012 Guthrie Theatre lineup, Dowling was criticized for the lack of diversity in the selection of directors and playwrights. In an interview with MPR, he said \\"this kind of drip drip drip of complaints about the Guthrie - I'm not certain that it's constructive.\\" In April 2014, Dowling announced that he would be retiring from the Guthrie Theater after the 2014/2015 season.

WPLN is an effort by the directors of Nashville Public Radio to find a place to program such NPR features as The Diane Rehm Show and similar fare that have a definite audience but a lesser one than public radio standbys such as NPR's All Things Considered, Talk of the Nation and Morning Edition and American Public Media's A Prairie Home Companion. These are programmed on WPLN-FM, 90.3 MHz, while the alternative programs are aired on the AM. A few features are aired by both at different times. Callsign The callsign 'WPLN' comes from the original status of public radio in Nashville as a subsidiary of the public library, 'PLN' standing for Public Library of Nashville. Although the library and the radio station had developed separate operations and boards of directors well before the addition of the AM station, the FM radio had retained the 'PLN' moniker and it was deemed to be less potentially confusing for the AM station likewise to use it in preference to any other. History WPLN began broadcasting on April 1, 2002 as WQDQ, shortly after Nashville Public Radio acquired the station. WQDQ became WPLN on April 9, 2002. Following many years of relative success as pioneering country music station WENO, 1430 AM had numerous owners and several formats, and shortly before the sale, it had been simulcasting the news programming of local CBS television affiliate WTVF and its affiliated cable outlet. The station was generally considered to be financially marginal, which is why the frequency was available for sale to the local public radio board. In general, the AM frequency is part of a trend for radio markets of 1 million people or more to have multiple public outlets carrying distinct formats. However, with Nashville Public Radio's purchase Vanderbilt University student station WRVU and converting it to an all-classical format as WFCL, WPLN-FM's format was changed on June 8, 2011, to an all-news-and-talk format similar to WPLN's former format; at this point WPLN began changing over to the format outlined above.

First introduced in 1964 as the Action Office I product line, then superseded by the Action Office II series, it is an influential design in the history of \\"contract furniture\\" (office furniture). The Action Office II series introduced the concept of the flexible, semi-enclosed workspaces, now better known as the cubicle. All cubicle office designs can be traced back to Herman Miller's Action Office product lines. History In 1960 Herman Miller created the Herman Miller Research Corporation, placing the new organization under the supervision of George Nelson, with day-to-day activities directed by Robert Propst. Although Nelson remained at Herman Miller's main campus in Zeeland, Michigan, Propst and the Herman Miller Research Corporation were located in Ann Arbor, Michigan (placing it in close proximity to the University of Michigan campus). Herman Miller Research Corporation's mission was not to address problems with furniture itself, but to solve problems related to the use of furniture. The corporation's first major project was an evaluation of \\"the office\\" as it had evolved during the 20th century -- particularly how it functioned in the 1960s. Propst's studies included learning about the ways people work in an office, how information travels, and how the office layout affects their performance. He consulted with Joan Evans (scholar of ornament and pattern), Terry Allen and Carl Frost (Michigan State University psychologists), Robert Sumner (who investigated the effects of different spaces on mental health), Edward T. Hall (anthropologist and author of the 1959 book, The Silent Language), as well as with a number of specialists, including mathematicians and behavioral psychologists. Propst concluded from his studies that during the 20th century, the office environment had changed substantially, especially when considering the dramatic increase in the amount of information being processed. Despite the change in what an employee had to analyze, organize, and maintain on a daily basis, the basic layout of the corporate office had remained largely unchanged, with employees sitting behind rows of traditional desks in a large open room that was devoid of privacy. Propst's studies suggested that an open environment actually reduced communication between employees, and impeded personal initiative. On this, Propst commented that \\"one of the regrettable conditions of present day offices is the tendency to provide a formula kind of sameness for everyone.\\" In addition, the employees' bodies were suffering from long hours of sitting in one position. Propst concluded that office workers require both privacy and interaction, depending on which of their many duties they were performing. =Action Office I= Propst and the Herman Miller Research Corporation formulated a plan to address the problems plaguing office workers of the time, which George Nelson's team realized in the form of the Action Office I. It was introduced in the Herman Miller lineup in 1964. Action Office I featured desks and workspaces of varying height that allowed the worker freedom of movement, and the flexibility to assume the work position best suited for the task. Action Office I was ideally suited to small professional offices in which managers and employees often interacted using the same furnishings. However, Action Office I was expensive, difficult to assemble, and was not suitable for offices at large corporations. Despite the shortcomings of Action Office I, Nelson won the Alcoa Award for the product's design, neglecting to mention Propst's contribution. =Action Office II= Following the poor sales of Action Office I, Propst and Nelson went back to the drawing board, and sought to create the next-generation, Action Office II. For several years Propst and Nelson fought over what kind of work environment they believed would best suit a corporate office worker. Unable to come to an agreement, Nelson was eventually taken off the project. With Nelson gone, Propst was free to explore his concept of an office that was capable of frequent modification to suit the changing needs of the employee, without having to purchase new furnishings. He wanted to allow the employee a degree of privacy, and the ability to personalize their work environment without impacting the environment of the workers around them. Propst recognized that people are more productive within a territorial enclave that they can personalize, but also require vistas outside their space. His concept was the \\"back-up,\\" a two or three sided vertical division that defined territory and afforded privacy without hindering the ability to view or participate in happenings outside the space. Action Office II was based around the mobile wall unit that defines space. The unit also supported multiple workstation furnishings that benefited from the vertically oriented work space. The components were interchangeable, standardized, and simple to assemble and install. More importantly, they were highly flexible, allowing the company to modify the work environment as needs changed. The Action Office II lineup was an unprecedented success, often referred to as the birth of the modern cubicle, and was quickly copied by other manufacturers. Despite the Action Office II line becoming Herman Miller's most successful project, George Nelson distanced himself from any connection with the project. In 1970, he sent a letter to Robert Blaich, who had become Herman Miller's Vice-President for Corporate Design and Communication, in which he described the system's \\"dehumanizing effect as a working environment.\\" He summed up his feeling by saying: > One does not have to be an especially perceptive critic to realize that AO- > II is definitely not a system which produces an environment gratifying for > people in general. But it is admirable for planners looking for ways of > cramming in a maximum number of bodies, for \\"employees\\" (as against > individuals), for \\"personnel,\\" corporate zombies, the walking dead, the > silent majority. A large market. Scornful as he may have been, Nelson was correct in stating that there would be a \\"larger market\\" for Action Office II. By 2005 total sales had reached $5 billion. =Coherent Structures= Propst's last contribution to the Action Office lineup was a series of furnishings designed specifically for the hospital and laboratory setting. Known as Coherent Structures, the series of highly mobile containers, frames, carts, storage devices, and rails were introduced in 1971. Designed to streamline the service functions of a hospital environment, they were highly successful until the advent of centralized computer systems made such portability of physical documents obsolete. =Ethospace= Designed by Jack Kelley, who worked on the design of both Action Office I and Action Office II, Ethospace enhanced the wall elements of the Action Office II system. Kelley changed the wall units to highly varied -- but standardized -- tiles that could simply slide into a frame and be finished with end caps. By selecting new Ethospace tiles, one could quickly change the color, texture, function, and character of the workspace without dismantling the frame or disrupting work. First installations The first offices to incorporate Action Office products were in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which had contracted with George Nelson and Herman Miller in 1963 to design an innovative office space that could maximize efficiency in a small area. The resulting design was based on Nelson's CPS (Comprehensive Panel System), and featured \\"pods\\" of four cubicles arranged in a swastika pattern, each with an L-shaped desk and overhead storage. Surviving photos of the Federal Reserve Bank offices reveal a design that would not appear much different from a cubicle of today. In 1964 this design was re-used for the Woman's Medical Clinic of Lafayette, Indiana, and in Nelson's own New York design offices. Action Office today The Action Office I series was dropped from the Herman Miller lineup in 1970. In 1978 the Action Office II line was renamed simply Action Office. Herman Miller describes it as \\"the world's first open plan office system,\\" and claims a $5 billion installed base. In 1985 the Worldwidedesign Congress named Action Office the \\"Most Significant Design since 1960\\". Recent modifications to Action Office include increased storage and more collaborative workspaces. The New York Museum of Modern Art added Resolve, a 1999 design that incorporates technology and 120¬∞ corners, to the museum's permanent collection in 2001. In 1997, Robert Propst said that he had hoped that his idea would \\"give knowledge workers a more flexible, fluid environment than the rat-maze boxes of offices,\\" but regretted that his idea had evolved to some extent into just that, saying that \\"the cubicle-izing of people in modern corporations is monolithic insanity.\\" In the media Action Office furnishings have appeared in many films released within the last thirty years. The first film to feature Action Office products was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, released in 1968. In the film a white Action Office I roll-top desk is used in the space station reception area. See also * Office landscape * Office space planning * Systems furniture References External links * D.

Members of the society, rebelling against the Qing dynasty, occupied old Shanghai and many of the surrounding villages. Chinese gentry and merchants took refuge in the British and French concessions, which were regarded as the only safe places. The rebellion was suppressed and the society expelled from Shanghai in February 1855. History Headquarters of the Small Swords Society in Shanghai The organization was founded in 1850 during the upheavals leading to the Taiping Rebellion, its original leader being a Singaporean-born merchant with British citizenship, Chen Qingzhen (), in Xiamen, Fujian Province, many among its leadership also being English-speaking Singapore Chinese. It was one of a number of rebel groups to arise during this period, either affiliated with or proclaiming support for the Taiping administration. The name (\\"Small Swords\\") refers to daggers used by warriors or martial artists in close combat. It is believed to be linked to triads. The society consisted mainly of natives from Guangdong and Fujian, including Li Shaoqing, Li Xianyun and Pan Yiguo, directors of some of the huiguan or native place associations of Shanghai. They were opposed to both Buddhism and Daoism, issuing proclamations against both faiths. Some of these proclamations were translated for an English- speaking audience by Alexander Wylie. The Small Swords Society was a variant of the Heaven and Earth Societies (Tiandihui) that organised the Red Turban Rebellion in Guangdong province, and used their symbolism. The Society succeeded in seizing Xiamen, Tong'an, Zhangzhou, and Zhangpu in Fujian province, but was forced to withdraw after heavy fighting, continuing resistance at sea until 1858. While in Xiamen, they allied with forces of the Red Turban Rebellion in Humen to seize the city of Huizhou, near Guangzhou, Guangdong province, helping to galvanise that insurrection. In 1851 the Society occupied the Chinese city of Shanghai without invading the foreign concessions. The circuit intendant was forced to flee.. Large numbers of Chinese refugees from surrounding areas flooded into the foreign concessions in this period, dramatically increasing the population there and giving rise to the prevalent longtang or shikumen-style housing which came to dominate Shanghai by the early 20th Century. The Society's headquarters were in the Yu Garden of Shanghai, at the heart of the old city and today a popular tourist attraction and shopping district. There is a small museum displaying artefacts of the Society in the gardens. The Small Sword Society in Shanghai initially declared the re-establishment of Da Ming Guo (), the Great Ming State, and elected Liu Lichuan as leader, who wrote to the Heavenly King of the Taiping Tianguo to join his rebellion, subsequently adopting the Taiping Tianguo name. The society took steps to issue currency, encourage trade and stabilise the food supply. Conflict broke out between the Fujian and Guangdong factions, over whether they should leave with the loot they had acquired. At first, the British and American authorities remained neutral, while the French supported the imperial government. However, some British and American sailors joined up with the Small Swords Society. When French troops were sent in to support Qing imperial troops, this caused the situation of Westerners fighting Westerners. The British and American authorities then declared the sailors' actions illegal and joined in support for the imperial armies. The society's forces tried to break out from the siege but was destroyed in February 1855. Remnant forces regrouped with the Taiping army.

The total AISH caseload was 69,785 in 2020, which represents 1.6% of Alberta's population. For those eligible for AISH, benefits include a monthly payment, as well as access to a number of services and/or subsidies, including prescriptions, dental and optical services. In 2020, the primary medical conditions of 44.1% of AISH recipients were related to physical disabilities, 30.4% were related to mental illness disorders, and 25.4% to cognitive disorders, and over 40% of AISH recipients were over fifty years of age. By 2020, the maximum AISH rate for a single person was C$1,685 per month. AISH is not indexed to the Consumer Price Index. Since 1998, there has been a C$100,000 limit on the amount of liquid assets an AISH recipient can possess. There is also a dollar for dollar claw back on any form of additional income above a set amount that an individual or a family unit receiving AISH, might earn or receive. Such offsets include federal aid, such as Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefits, a spouse's income, disability benefits through a private insurance plan, and/or Worker Compensation Board (WCB) benefits. Overview The AISH program, established in 1979, provides financial and health related assistance to eligible adult Albertans with a disability. AISH was the first program in the country designed for the permanently disabled. It was unique as there were no asset limits. In 2010, total AISH caseload was 41,664; by July 2020, it was 69,785‚Äîwhich represents 1.6% of Alberta's population receiving AISH benefits as primary recipients. By 2020, 86.1% of AISH recipients were single, and only 2.7% were couples with children. The highest proportion of cases‚Äî44.1%‚Äîthe primary medical condition were related to physical disabilities, 30.4% were related to mental illness disorders, and 25.4% to cognitive disorders. About 15.6% of AISH beneficiaries were aged between 60 and 64, 15.4% were aged between 55 and 59 years, and 11.2% were aged between 50 and 54. Albertans over 65 years of age are no longer eligible for AISH benefits. By 2020, the maximum AISH rate for a single person is C$1,685 per month. In the 2004 provincial election, AISH was the subject of some controversy following supposedly derogatory remarks made by Premier Ralph Klein, stating, of a group of AISH recipients, \\"they didn't look handicapped to me.\\" According to the September 2020, Alberta Community and Social Services Open Data report, eligibility to the provincial AISH program's financial and health benefits includes a number of criteria including evidence that the adult Albertan has a severe and permanent disability or disabilities that substantially prevent them from earning a livelihood. Criteria for determining AISH benefits also includes evaluating the existing income and assets available to the applicant through the client and their cohabiting partner. Once approved, an AISH beneficiary may have access to financial and health related benefits needed to assist them to live as independently as possible. Along with a monthly living allowance, this may include a child benefit allowance, specified health benefits, and some personal benefits. Some of these benefits may be either added regular monthly benefits or one-time payments. Since at least 2011‚Äîalong with a base monthly payment‚ÄîAISH beneficiaries may also be eligible for certain health benefits and or subsidies. This includes most prescription medications, some dental, optical, ambulance, some Alberta Aids to Daily Living (AADL) and transits services, as well as some essential diabetic supplies. AISH benefits include a dental checkup and cleaning every six months, and all necessary fillings; one routine eye exam and a new pair of eyeglasses every two years; about C$41 for people with diabetes who require a special diet; and fees for some ground ambulance service. Some municipal areas offer transit options for eligible AISH recipients that may include a subsidized monthly pass.The majority of prescriptions‚Äîsuch as antibiotics, Ritalin and Zyprexa‚Äîare covered by AISH. A government committee makes the decision on which drugs are covered by AISH. Eligibility and offsets According to the May 1, 2007 AISH Act legislation updated as of November 1, 2010, in order to qualify for the province of Alberta's Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH), an Alberta adult resident must have a severe‚Äîand likely permanent disability with no available remedial therapy‚Äîthat seriously \\"impairs their ability to earn a living.\\" Decision on eligibility is made by the AISH director, based on relevant medical or psychological reports from a qualified health professional(s). AISH benefits are conditional on an applicants financial needs as well as health status. The AISH director makes the final decision on whether an applicant will receive any or all potential AISH benefits. An AISH recipient becomes ineligible if they have personal total net assets of more than C$100,000 in monetary assets, such as a savings account, or bonds, for example. This does not include ownership of a primary residence or mode of transport. AISH recipients submit an financial update of transactions, annually to their assigned AISH worker. This includes providing bank statements for the account in which the AISH payments were deposited. The $100,000 assets limit was introduced to AISH in 1998, as politicians became concerned over \\"millionaires\\" on the program. =Offsets= Recipients' benefits are reduced dollar for dollar by income from other sources including CERB, CPP disability benefits, their spouse's income, disability benefits through a private insurance plan, and/or Worker Compensation Board (WCB) benefits. In 2012, an AISH recipient could receive net employment income up to C$1072 per month without his/her AISH income being clawed back. In February 2012, families can earn up to a net income of C$2,612 per month. In April 2012, the provincial government clarified limits on the amounts of Employment Income an AISH recipient could receive before a clawback. For a client making a net employment income between C$1,072 and C$2,009 a month, there was a 50% exemption of AISH income, after C$2,009 a month the amount earned is deducted dollar for dollar from the AISH amount for the maximum total income (employment + AISH) of C$3226.00 a month. For families, in 2011, the same 50% exemption applied to those making between C$2,612 to C$3,349 net income, and dollar for dollar deductions after C$3,349 for a maximum total income of C$4,666.00 a month. In April 2020, the provincial governments AISH payment formulas were recalculated based on the Government of Canada's Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), a monthly payment of $2000 provided to all eligible Canadians in response to coronavirus recession during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. In April, the UCP Alberta government announced that a \\"family receiving AISH benefits would see the first $875 fully exempt from the CERB, but any money over and above that is deducted at a rate of 75 per cent.\\" For a single person, they would see the first C$420 fully exempt and any money above that would be deducted. A May 2020 CTV News article explained how for one such family unit in Lethbridge, Alberta with one child, where one individual with cerebral palsy receives an AISH benefit and another family member, a chef laid off from his job because of the pandemic, received C$2000 CERB benefit, had about $900 clawed back by the Alberta government. The family said that, \\"What they‚Äôre doing is deducting from her cheques. They‚Äôre taking almost $900 away from what I receive because I‚Äôm receiving CERB and at the end of all this, we have another month before things get well enough that I‚Äôll be working again, so that‚Äôll be around $3,200 we‚Äôll be owing AISH.\\" Some Canadians choose to begin to receive the national Canada Pension Plan (CPP) before their 65th birthday. Any income that an AISH recipient receives from the national Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is deducted dollar for dollar from the AISH benefit. For example, a recipient who received the maximum CPP disability payment of C$1,001.37 would have received C$683.63 from AISH in 2019. In 2020, they would receive C$1,377.66 from CPP and C$297.34 from AISH. All AISH benefits end when a person reaches the minimum age of 65. In Canada, at 65, individuals become potentially eligible for federal financial supports, such as Old Age Security (OAS), the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), and CPP. The old age security amount for a single person, who has met the resident requirements for full old age security, is currently $585.49 per month. If a person has no other income, then the Guaranteed Income Supplement will be an additional $874.48 per month. These two amounts total to $1,459.97 per month. A single woman, Kathy, has a small work pension which pays her $2,400 yearly. Kathy can expect a combined OAS (Old Age Security) GIS (Guaranteed Income Supplement) of $1,351.97 per month. A single man, David, retires but earns $12,000 a year part time. He could expect a combined OAS + GIS of $824.53 per month. Conditions such as time in Canada and Marital status can effect these calculations. If requirements are met, and no other income is available, then a person can expect $1,459.97 per month as a minimum. Changes to benefits Then Premier Allison Redford, who won the 2012 Alberta general election, increased AISH monthly benefits by C$400 to C$1,588 in 2012. In 2018, the New Democratic Party (NDP) government, under then Premier Rachel Notley, connected some social benefit rates for financial assistance programs‚Äîwhich included AISH and seniors benefits‚Äîto the Consumer Price Index through Bill 26: An Act to Combat Poverty and Fight for Albertans with Disabilities. Starting in January 2019, with the cost of living adjustment added to AISH benefits to rise with inflation, monthly AISH payments increased to C$1,685. The October 24, 2019 provincial budget, tabled by Finance Minister Travis Toews during the Premiership of Jason Kenney, included \\"cuts to spending programs and the elimination of hundreds of bureaucracy jobs\\" as well a corporate tax cuts in order to fulfill the United Conservative Party's (UCP) key campaign promises outlined in their 4-year plan to balance the budget. Spending cuts included de-indexing AISH benefits from the Consumer Price Index for four years. The AISH rate will be fixed at a maximum C$1,685 per month instead of rising by 1.57% per year ($108.00 over a four-year term). As well, AISH payment dates were changed to February 28, April 1, May 1, June 1, June 30, July 31, September 1, October 30, December 1, and December 31. Since the beginning of 2020, payment dates were changes so that payments will fall on the first of the month, unless that day falls on a weekend. In that event the payment date will be the Friday before the weekend. Ministry responsible for AISH The Ministry responsible for Seniors was also responsibility for the AISH program. In 2012, responsibility for the AISH program, was moved to the newly formed Human Services ministry. By 2020, the Ministry of Community and Social Services (CSS) was responsible for the AISH program. On April 30, 2019, Rajan Sawhney was appointed as CSS Ministry during the premiership of Jason Kenney. = Comparisons with similar provincial programs = Along with AISH in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Ontario have basically similar income support for persons with disabilities programs. In B.C. it is called the British Columbia Employment & Assistance for Persons with Disabilities (BCEA); the Ontario equivalent is called the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP); the Saskatchewan equivalent is called Saskatchewan Assured Income for Disability (SAID). These provincial program benefits vary by family status. For example, BCEA provides a single recipient with no children C$1,183.42 a month and a single parent with two children $1,609.08 a month in 2020.British Columbia Employment and Assistance for Persons with Disabilities (BCEA) Saskatchewan program gives $931-$1064 a month plus the cost of electricity (amount depends on which city the person lives in). While AISH has a personal total net assets of C$100,000 (NOT including the assets of the primary residence AND mode of transportation, like a car), SAID has a liquid asset limit of C$1,500 for a single person and C$3,000 for a couple with no children. Every dollar above that amount will be clawed back from the client dollar for dollar.

Early life Born Maxwell Zweifach in the Austro-Hungarian Empire on March 14, 1884, to Austrian-Jewish father Adolf and Italian mother Hanna, he and his family emigrated to New York in 1886 to escape the antisemitic riots, settling right below the Williamsburg Bridge on Delancey Street. Although Zweifach's father had hoped he would join the family tailoring business, Zweifach proved otherwise and was a prominent young thief by teenage years. Criminal career Zweifach was first arrested on a charge of grand larceny in June 1899 on the suspicion of stealing a bicycle. When asked his occupation by the judge, Zweifach quipped, \\"Bicycles\\". Max pleaded guilty and was let off the hook with a fine. Zweifach soon graduated into more serious offenses. Max's right-hand man was his brother Daniel, aka Kid Slyfox. Tall and well-built, both Zweifach brothers led some of their friends during Election Day 1902 rioting to support Republican politician Sam Koenig in the Sixteenth Assembly District. By 1903, Max Zweifach had picked up the nickname of \\"Kid Twist\\" and was known as a dangerous and cunning gang leader. On August 17, 1903, Kid Twist was charged with fatally shooting a rival gangster named John \\"Mugsy\\" Bayard during an argument after a card game. Zweifach was discharged on the grounds of self-defense and soon attracted the attention of gang boss Monk Eastman. When Eastman was locked up for robbery the next year, Kid Twist found himself at odds with his old pal Richie Fitzpatrick over the leadership of the gang. This feud came to a head on October 30, 1904, when Fitzpatrick shot and wounded one of Kid Twist's men, Thomas McCauley, in a saloon dispute. Two nights later, Twist invited his rival to a peace conference at a saloon at 77 Sheriff Street. The meeting devolved into an argument. Fitzpatrick, realizing he was about to be hit, rushed out of the place. One of Twist's men, Harris Stahl, gave chase and shot him to death. Stahl would be acquitted of Fitzpatrick's murder several months later. Kid Twist concocted a scheme to bilk the New York Central Railroad out of thousands of dollars, by having the owners of a nearby print shop distribute $4,000 of phony ticket passes to the public through scalpers. Twist and his partners were arrested in the spring of 1905 and charged with forgery. Ultimately, no one was convicted. During his heyday, Kid Twist's top men included his brother Kid Slyfox, Harris Stahl, Big Jack Zelig, Ike the Blood, and Samuel Pristrich, aka Cyclone Louie, a former wrestler and sideshow strongman who was famous for twisting iron bars around his arms and neck. Cyclone Louie would later move in with Zweifach and his family at 255 Sackman Street in Brownsville. Zweifach also began distributing his own brand of celery tonic to shopkeepers in his territory. The drink, packaged in bottles that bore his picture, was muscled in at exorbitant prices. Any store owner who refused to carry Kid Twist's celery tonic had his business trashed, or worse. Kid Twist also put the squeeze on illegal gambling games in his neighborhood. A case in point involved a Five Points gangster named Charles Greenwich, aka The Bottler, who ran a profitable stuss game on Suffolk Street. Kid Twist informed him in early 1907 that Harris Stahl was coming in as an equal partner in his game. The Bottler fumed but complied with this demand. Some weeks later, Twist told The Bottler he was now out completely, and that another gangster named The Nailer would take the other half of the game. Greenwich barricaded the doors of his establishment and dared the Kid Twist gang to get him. On May 31, 1907, police interrupted an armed standoff between The Bottler and Harris Stahl. Both men were taken into custody and fined $5. The next night, the two men ran into each other at Suffolk and Broome streets and went for their guns. The Bottler wound up shot to death. Both Twist and Stahl loudly mourned the passing of their \\"friend\\" and festooned the stuss house with crepe. =Demise= Despite having a wife and child at his Brownsville home, Kid Twist was known as a ladies man around town, and it was this that would prove the end of him. Zweifach's regular girlfriend was a Canadian dancer named Carroll Terry, who also happened to be seeing Louis Pioggi aka Louie The Lump, an up-and-coming member of the Five Points Gang. Their romantic rivalry allegedly came to a head in the spring of 1908, when Kid Twist and Cyclone Louie got the drop on Louie the Lump in a Coney Island gin mill and amused themselves by forcing him, at gunpoint, to jump out of a second-story window. Soon after this, Louie the Lump confronted Carroll Terry at the Imperial Dance Hall and was told that she no longer had any interest in him. In the late afternoon of May 14, 1908, Kid Twist and Cyclone Louie repaired to Coney Island to catch Carroll Terry's show at the Imperial. Afterwards, she hooked Louie up with a fellow dancer of hers named Mabel Leon, and the two couples went to a nearby Italian cafe on Oceanic Walk for dinner. The quartet left the cafe around 8 o'clock and began walking down the avenue. They did not see Louie the Lump until it was far too late. The Italian gangster darted out of the darkness and clubbed Carroll Terry sprawling with a fist. He then opened fire on the two gangsters. Kid Twist was fatally struck once behind the ear while Cyclone Louie was riddled with six bullets. Both men collapsed dead into the doorway of the South Brooklyn Hotel. Terry herself was struck in the hip during the barrage. As Louie the Lump made his getaway, a police officer yelled for him to halt. Pioggi whirled around and fired one shot, which ripped off the officer's helmet. It has long been suspected that Louis Pioggi did not act alone that night. According to underworld legend, while Kid Twist and his party were having their supper, Louie The Lump got on the telephone to Paul Kelly, boss of the Five Points Gang, and asked permission to kill Kid Twist. A carriage full of Italian gangsters soon arrived at Coney Island, ready for action. Michael Cleary, the bartender of a nearby saloon, said he had indeed seen a carriage parked near the South Brooklyn Hotel before the shooting. Just after the killings, the driver jumped down from the cab and tossed Cleary a revolver, asking to hold it in case he was arrested. =Aftermath= Louie The Lump was arrested several days later in Saybrook, Connecticut. The two charges of murder were downgraded to manslaughter and Pioggi pleaded guilty. After receiving his sentence of eleven months in jail, Louie the Lump sneered that, \\"I could do that standin' on me head!\\" After the death of Kid Twist Zweifach, the Eastman Gang split into factions, continuing their feud with the Five Pointers. Leadership of the largest faction eventually fell to Zweifach's young prot√©g√©, Jack Zelig. Years later, it was said that gangster Abe Reles took his nickname of \\"Kid Twist\\" from the long-dead Zweifach. References *Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York. New York: Alfred A.

However one distinct characteristic between 1923‚Äì1985, in large part as a result of government policies, a backward economy developed into a complex economic system producing a wide range of agricultural, industrial, and service products for both domestic and export markets the economy grew at an average annual rate of six percent. Since 1820, Turkey has experienced economic growth and human development at average levels (compared to the rest of the world) but at higher rates than other developing countries.  From World War I to World War II  Atat√ºrk the economy advanced from state based policies to a mixed economy in line with the increase in capital in the society At the time of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire (see Economy of the Ottoman Empire) during World War I and the subsequent birth of the Republic, the Turkish economy was underdeveloped: agriculture depended on outmoded techniques and poor-quality livestock, and Turkey's industrial base was weak; the few factories producing basic products such as sugar and flour were under foreign control as a result of the capitulations. Turkey's economy recovered remarkably once hostilities ceased. From 1923 to 1926, agricultural output rose by eighty-seven percent, as agricultural production returned to pre-war levels. Industry and services grew at more than nine percent per year from 1923 to 1929; however, their share of the economy remained quite low at the end of the decade. The government stepped in during the early 1930s to promote economic recovery, following a doctrine known as statism. Growth slowed during the worst years of the depression, except between 1935 and 1939 when it reached six percent per year. During the 1940s, the economy stagnated, in large part because maintaining armed neutrality during World War II increased the country's military expenditures while almost entirely curtailing foreign trade.  Post 1950  After 1950 the country suffered economic disruptions about once a decade; the most serious crisis occurred in the late 1970s. In each case, an industry-led period of rapid expansion, marked by a sharp increase in imports, resulted in a balance of payments crisis. Devaluations of the Turkish lira and austerity programs designed to dampen domestic demand for foreign goods were implemented in accordance with International Monetary Fund guidelines. These measures usually led to sufficient improvement in the country's external accounts to make possible the resumption of loans to Turkey by foreign creditors. Although the military interventions of 1960 and 1971 were prompted in part by economic difficulties, after each intervention Turkish politicians boosted government spending, causing the economy to overheat. In the absence of serious structural reforms, Turkey ran chronic current account deficits usually financed by external borrowing that made the country's external debt rise from decade to decade, reaching by 1980 about US$16.2 billion, or more than one-quarter of annual gross domestic product. Debt-servicing costs in that year equaled 33 percent of exports of goods and services. By the late 1970s, Turkey's economy had perhaps reached its worst crisis since the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Turkish authorities had failed to take sufficient measures to adjust to the effects of the sharp increase in world oil prices in 1973‚Äì74 and had financed the resulting deficits with short-term loans from foreign lenders. By 1979 inflation had reached triple- digit levels, unemployment had risen to about 15 percent, the industry was using only half its capacity, and the government was unable to pay even the interest on foreign loans. It seemed that Turkey would be able to sustain crisis-free development only if major changes were made in the government's import-substitution approach to development. Many observers doubted the ability of Turkish politicians to carry out the needed reforms.Onder, Nilgun (1990). Turkey's experience with corporatism (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University  Reforms under √ñzal  In January 1980, the government of Prime Minister S√ºleyman Demirel (who had served as prime minister 1965‚Äì71, 1975‚Äì78, and 1979‚Äì80) began implementing a far-reaching reform program designed by then Undersecretary of the Prime Ministry Turgut √ñzal to shift Turkey's economy toward export-led growth. The √ñzal strategy called for import-substitution policies to be replaced with policies designed to encourage exports that could finance imports, giving Turkey a chance to break out of the postwar pattern of alternating periods of rapid growth and deflation. With this strategy, planners hoped Turkey could experience export-led growth over the long run. The government pursued these goals by means of a comprehensive package: devaluation of the Turkish lira and institution of flexible exchange rates, maintenance of positive real interest rates and tight control of the money supply and credit, elimination of most subsidies and the freeing of prices charged by state enterprises, reform of the tax system, and encouragement of foreign investment. In July 1982, when √ñzal left office, many of his reforms were placed on hold. Starting in November 1983, however, when he again became prime minister, he was able to extend the liberalization program. The liberalization program overcame the balance of payments crisis, reestablished Turkey's ability to borrow in international capital markets, and led to renewed economic growth. Merchandise exports grew from US$2.3 billion in 1979 to US$8.3 billion in 1985. Merchandise import growth in the same periodfrom US$4.8 billion to US$11.2 billiondid not keep pace with export growth and proportionately narrowed the trade deficit, although the deficit level stabilized at around US$2.5 billion. √ñzal's policies had a particularly positive impact on the services account of the current account. Despite a jump in interest payments, from US$200 million in 1979 to US$1.4 billion in 1985, the services account accumulated a growing surplus during this period. Expanding tourist receipts and pipeline fees from Iraq were the main reasons for this improvement. Stabilizing the current account helped restore creditworthiness on international capital markets. Foreign investment, which had been negligible in the 1970s, now started to grow, although it remained modest in the mid-1980s. Also, Turkey was able to borrow on the international market, whereas in the late 1970s it could only seek assistance from the IMF and other official creditors. The reduction in public expenditures, which was at the heart of the stabilization program, slowed the economy sharply in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Real gross national product declined 1.5 percent in 1979 and 1.3 percent in 1980. The manufacturing and services sectors felt much of the impact of this drop in income, with the manufacturing sector operating at close to 50 percent of total capacity. As the external-payments constraint eased, the economy bounced back sharply. Between 1981 and 1985, real GNP grew 3 percent per year, led by growth in the manufacturing sector. With tight controls on workers' earnings and activities, the industrial sector began drawing on unused industrial capacity and raised output by an average rate of 9.1 percent per year between 1981 and 1985. The devaluation of the lira also helped make Turkey more economically competitive. As a result, exports of manufactures increased by an average rate of 4.5 percent per annum during this period. The rapid resurgence of growth and the improvement in the balance of payments were insufficient to overcome unemployment and inflation, which remained serious problems. The official jobless rate fell from 15 percent in 1979 to 11 percent in 1980, but, partly because of the rapid growth of the labor force, unemployment rose again, to 13 percent in 1985. Inflation fell to about 25 percent in the 1981‚Äì82 period, but it climbed again, to more than 30 percent in 1983 and more than 40 percent in 1984. Although inflation eased somewhat in 1985 and 1986, it remained one of the primary problems facing economic policy makers.  Economic performance in the early 1990s  With limited access to the Persian Gulf, Iraq also came to depend heavily on Turkey for export routes for its crude oil. Iraq had financed two pipelines located next to one another from its northern Kirkuk oilfields to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Yumurtalƒ±k, slightly northwest of ƒ∞skenderun. The capacity of the pipelines totaled around (bpd). Not only did Turkey obtain part of its domestic supplies from the pipeline, but it was paid a sizable entrep√¥t fee. Some sources have estimated this fee at US$300 million to US$500 million. Turkey's economy was battered by the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The UN embargo on Iraq required the ending of oil exports through the Kirkuk- Yumurtalƒ±k pipelines, resulting in the loss of the pipeline fees. In addition, the economy may have lost as much as US$3 billion in trade with Iraq. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) moved to compensate Turkey for these losses, however, and by 1992 the economy again began to grow rapidly. Turkey's impressive economic performance in the 1980s won high marks from Wall Street's credit-rating agencies. In 1992 and 1993, the government used these ratings to attract funds to cover its budget deficits. International bond issues over this period amounted to US$7.5 billion. These capital flows helped maintain the overvalued exchange rate. In a market economy, a high level of government borrowing should translate into higher domestic interest rates and even possibly \\"crowd out\\" private-sector borrowers, thereby eventually slowing economic growth. But the government's foreign borrowing took the pressure off domestic interest rates and actually spurred more private-sector borrowing in an already overheated economy. Sensing an easy profit opportunity during this period, commercial banks borrowed at world interest rates and lent at Turkey's higher domestic rates without fear of a depreciating currency. As a result, Turkey's foreign short- term debt rose sharply. External and internal confidence in the government's ability to manage the impending balance of payments crisis waned, compounding economic difficulties. Disputes between Prime Minister Tansu √áiller (1993‚Äì1996) and the Central Bank governor undermined confidence in the government. The prime minister insisted on monetizing the fiscal deficit (selling government debt instruments to the Central Bank) rather than acceding to the Central Bank's proposal to issue more public debt in the form of government securities. The Central Bank governor resigned in August 1993 over this issue. In January 1994, international credit agencies downgraded Turkey's debt to below investment grade. At that time, a second Central Bank governor resigned. Mounting concern over the disarray in economic policy was reflected in an accelerated \\"dollarization\\" of the economy as residents switched domestic assets into foreign-currency deposits to protect their investments. By the end of 1994, about 50 percent of the total deposit base was held in the form of foreign-currency deposits, up from 1 percent in 1993. The downgrading by credit-rating agencies and a lack of confidence in the government's budget deficit target of 14 percent of GDP for 1994 triggered large-scale capital flight and the collapse of the exchange rate. The government had to intervene by selling its foreign-currency reserves to staunch the decline of the Turkish lira. As a result, reserves fell from US$6.3 billion at the end of 1993 to US$3 billion by the end of March 1994. Before the end of April, when the government was forced to announce a long-overdue austerity program following the March 1994 local elections, the lira had plummeted by 76 percent from the end of 1993 to TL41,000 against the United States dollar. The package of measures announced by the government on April 5, 1994, was also submitted to the IMF as part of its request for a US$740 million standby facility beginning in July 1994. Measures included a sharp increase in prices the public-sector enterprises would charge the public, decreases in budgetary expenditures, a commitment to raise taxes, and a pledge to accelerate privatization of state economic enterprises (SEEs). Some observers questioned the credibility of these measures, given that the tax measures translated into a revenue increase equivalent to 4 percent of GDP and the expenditure cuts were equivalent to 6 percent of GDP. The government actually succeeded in generating a small surplus in the budget during the second quarter of 1994, mainly as a result of higher taxes, after running a deficit of 17 percent of GDP in the first quarter. The slowdown in government spending, a sharp loss in business confidence, and the resulting decline in economic activity reduced tax revenues, however. The fiscal crisis resulted in a decline in real GDP of 5 percent in 1994 after the economy had grown briskly in 1992 and 1993. Real wages also fell in 1994: average nominal wage increases of 65 percent were about 20 percent below the rate of consumer price inflation. Analysts pointed out that despite the fragility of the macroeconomic adjustment process and the susceptibility of fiscal policy to political pressures, the government continued to be subject to market checks and balances. Combined with a stronger private sector, particularly on the export front, the economy was expected to bounce back to a pattern of faster growth.

He was born in D√ºren (then in Rhine Province, Prussia, today North Rhine-Westphalia). An athletic and hard-tackling player, with a strong physique, he was nicknamed the \\"Volkswagen\\" for his continuity of performance, both in quantity and in quality, and for his versatility; indeed, although he was usually deployed as a full-back, he was capable of playing anywhere along the back, and could also play as a centre-back, as a sweeper, or even as a defensive midfielder. In his prime he was often considered one of the best and most complete leftbacks in the world in his era, rivaled only by Giacinto Facchetti, Nilton Santos and Silvio Marzolini.  Club career  He won the German Championship with 1. FC K√∂ln in 1962, and was awarded the (Footballer of the Year (Germany)), performed well in the 1962 FIFA World Cup and was subsequently named in the tournament's 'Dream-Team'. After Schnellinger had left K√∂ln for A.C. Mantova in 1963, his debut in Serie A came in a match against A.C. Milan which ended in a surprising 4‚Äì1 victory for Mantova. However, he played there only for one season before he was signed by A.S. Roma in 1964 when they won the Coppa Italia, and finally by A.C. Milan in 1965, being transferred along with Roma teammates Antonio Valent√≠n Angelillo and Angelo Sormani. He played nine seasons with the Rossoneri, obtaining several successes both at the national and European level. He was one of the first successful German footballers abroad. Schnellinger left Milan in 1974, and retired after a season back in his native Germany with Tennis Borussia Berlin.  International career  He participated in his first 1958 World Cup in Sweden at the age of 19, and went on to become one of the few players to play in four World Cups (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970). He was renowned for his physical power, pace, and his winning mentality. His only international goal came in the last minute to draw 1‚Äì1 in the thrilling semi-final of the 1970 World Cup against Italy, which later became known as the \\"Game of the Century\\". His goal led to the famous German radio commentary line \\"Ausgerechnet Schnellinger!\\" ‚Äì roughly: \\"Of all the players, it's Schnellinger\\" ‚Äì which refers to him never having previously scored for the national team, and also to his being one of the two players in the German squad then playing in the Italian Serie A (the other being Helmut Haller). Italy eventually won 4‚Äì3 after extra time. In the previous round, late in the match against England, it was Schnellinger's cross that Uwe Seeler scored from with a backwards header that tied the score 2‚Äì2, a game West Germany won 3‚Äì2 after extra time. Schnellinger won his last cap in 1971.  Personal life  Today Schnellinger still lives in Milan's suburb of Segrate and works as a businessman.

Overview  It is located near the historical center of the city, at the intersection of Laprida and Mendoza Streets. Planned as a lyric theater, it was developed as Teatro La √ìpera by Emilio O. Schiffner, who purchased the society of the same name in 1889. Schiffner contracted German engineer George Goldammer, an acoustician who modified the original design, and the construction firm of Bianchi, Vila y Compa√±√≠a. Following delays caused by the Panic of 1890, as well as the earlier society's debts, the theatre was started in 1903. Italian artists, directed by Luggi Levoni, decorated both the interiors and exteriors; among their notable creations was the stage curtain designed by Giuseppe Carmignani with images from Greek mythology similar to those found in the Teatro Regio di Parma. Teatro La √ìpera was inaugurated on June 4, 1904, with the performance of Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. The theater received many artists from around the world, including opera singers, ballets, and orchestras. Enrico Caruso performed there in 1915, and compared its acoustic quality to that of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. After this phase of splendor, the theater began to decay, and by 1940 its demolition was being actively considered by the city. The abandoned catacombs underneath the theatre were converted into the Museum of Sacred Art in 1940 to house the prolific work of sculptor Eduardo Barnes. A cultural association known El C√≠rculo de la Biblioteca (The Library Circle), who previously gathered at the Biblioteca Argentina and needed another place for their meetings, acquired the building in 1943, preserved it, and changed its name to the present one. The theater has a capacity of 1,450 people, in five levels. It currently functions mostly as a cultural center. It was fully restored for its 100th anniversary in 2004, and served as a stage for the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language. The sidewalks and the two streets around the corner of the theater were turned into a sort of plaza with an early 20th-century look, using old lampposts and replacing the usual asphalted surface with cobblestones.

Master Jiyu's Stupa at Wesak Buddha at the Buddhahall of Shasta Abbey, Mt Shasta, California Shasta Abbey, located on sixteen forested acres near Mount Shasta in northern California, United States is a training monastery for Buddhist monks and a place of practice for lay Buddhists and interested visitors. It was established in 1970 by Reverend Master P.T.N.H. Jiyu-Kennett, who was Abbess and spiritual director until her death in 1996. History A monastery of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives (OBC), it was established in 1970 by Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett, a British woman, on behalf of her teacher, Keido Chisan Koho Zenji, her Master in Japan. In November 1969, Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett came to San Francisco on a lecture tour and stayed on in the United States to establish Shasta Abbey the following year. Rev. Master Jiyu- Kennett served twenty-six years as Abbess and spiritual director of Shasta Abbey, ordaining and teaching monks and lay people. She founded Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey in England in 1972. She also founded the OBC to establish a framework within which the temples she founded could come together.About: Shasta Abbey The second Abbot was Rev. Master Eko Little, a Dharma Heir of Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett and her assistant for 20 years. He succeeded Rev. Master Jiyu after her death and served as Abbot until 2010. He maintained his Master‚Äôs wishes for, and legacy to, Shasta Abbey in the 14 years following her death. In his time as Abbot, he continued to unfold Rev. Master Jiyu‚Äôs teaching, strengthening the fabric of the monastery, and enhancing the spiritual life of the Sangha, both monastic and lay.About: Shasta Abbey There were also some serious problems that came to light towards the end of his Abbacy, and in May, 2010, he left the Abbey and returned to lay life. The third, and current, Abbess is Rev. Master Meian Elbert, who was ordained in 1977 and received Dharma Transmission in 1979 from Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett. She was named a Master of the Order by Rev. Master Jiyu in 1989. She was chaplain to Rev. Master Jiyu for more than 15 years and has served the community as Vice Abbess, Chief Cook, Chief Precentor, Prior and Novice Master. She also served as Executive Secretary of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives. Rev. Master Meian was elected Abbess by the resident Shasta Abbey monastic community on June 17, 2010.About: Shasta Abbey Training Serene Reflection Meditation Buddhist training at Shasta Abbey is based on the practice of Serene Reflection Meditation (S≈çt≈ç Zen) and the keeping of the Buddhist Precepts. The resident monastic community includes approximately 26 vegetarian, celibate male and female monks. A Festival Ceremony in the Buddha Hall at Shasta Abbey The daily schedule is a kaleidoscope of seated meditation, ceremonial and working meditation in all its various forms in order to cultivate the mind of meditation in all aspects of daily life. The schedule flows through the day from the wake-up bell to lights out, and provides opportunities ‚Äú‚Ä¶to do what needs to be done‚Ä¶‚Äù. A typical day‚Äôs schedule is hard to define, but most days start with meditation and Morning Service. The day is then filled with the normal activities of daily life: Meals eaten together, individual monastic office tasks and tasks done together for the benefit of the whole community, time for individual spiritual practice and time for common ceremonial and practice, rest and renewal time including community tea and tea with the laity.Monastic Community: Shasta Abbey Lay residents staying at the Abbey for an extended period of time, and visitors participating in retreats are asked to follow a similar schedule to that of the monks. Both monks and laity observe the practice of The Middle Way as far as possible in the daily schedule. The Abbey is a place of silence and serenity for the local congregation, lay friends and interested visitors. Practitioners strive to follow the Buddha's Teachings wholeheartedly, giving up what seems important from the point of view of the self to follow the Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors. This is reflected in their attitude of faith and practice of DƒÅna(mutual assistance): :There really can be no price put on the Buddha Dharma. Thus, we at Shasta Abbey have chosen not to have fees or even suggested donation amounts. We make an offering of the teaching, and provide a training refuge, putting our faith in the practice of dana.About: Shasta Abbey Publications Shasta Abbey Press publishes Buddhist books, including the writings of its founder, Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett, and translations of many Buddhist texts. Among these are the master works of Soto Zen patriarchs Dogen Zenji (Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç) and Keizan Jokin Zenji (Denkoroku). Many publications can be accessed free of charge via the Shasta Abbey Website. The translations of Buddhist texts and scriptures at Shasta Abbey are particularly useful for practitioners of Buddhism in the West, as the translations are done from the mind of meditation and by actual Buddhist monks, as opposed to the worldly, literal-minded viewpoints of many scholastic western translators of the past. The translations are less esoteric and thus easier to understand from the point of view of Buddhist practice in a western context.

The stations are owned and operated by the Mid-South Public Communications Foundation, a non-profit organization governed by a board of trustees composed of volunteers. This board also operates Memphis' public television station, WKNO. Two stations comprise the network: WKNO-FM 91.1-- Memphis (flagship). Signal reaches about a 50-mile radius from the city, covering the southwestern corner of Tennessee, eastern Arkansas, the extreme southern portions of the Missouri Bootheel, and northwestern Mississippi. WKNP 90.1--Jackson, Tennessee. Signal covers much of the state between the Memphis area, the Tennessee River, and the Kentucky state line. History WKNO-FM began operations in 1972, as a single station broadcasting at 40,000 watts. (WKNO television had already been on the air since 1956.) The studios were first located on the main campus of Memphis State University (now University of Memphis). In 1979, the WKNO-FM and TV studios were relocated a few blocks to the south, to the southern annex of MSU on Getwell Road. That facility served the television and radio stations for 30 years until November 2009, when they moved into custom-designed all-digital studios, located in the Memphis suburb of Cordova. Commercial Appeal, November 15, 2009 As with many public radio outlets started during that era, programming in the early years consisted almost entirely of classical music. NPR news broadcasts did not become a significant portion of the daily schedule until well into the 1980s. The station increased its power during that period to a full 100,000 watts, thereby increasing its listenership with a stronger, clearer signal. As the popularity of public radio developed, the MSPCF decided to aggressively construct and acquire transmitters throughout the region, much of which had never been served by public radio before. It started by purchasing the broadcasting equipment of WNJC-FM, the defunct campus radio station (founded 1972) of Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, about 40 miles south of Memphis, in 1989. MSPCF kept that station's original call sign for a few years, before rechristening it to WKNA-FM, making it conform to the mother station's pattern. That station broadcast at 88.9 MHz. Next, the board set its sights on Tennessee's largest city without any public radio service, Jackson, and in 1990 started a repeater, WKNP. Finally, in 1993, WKNO-FM solidified its coverage of West Tennessee with a repeater serving northwestern Tennessee and southeastern Missouri, WKNQ. Situated in the town of Dyersburg, that station broadcast at 90.7 MHz. For a few years, the stations broadcast identical programs, except for daytime coverage of Memphis city council meetings, which were heard only on the mother station. In some portions of the listening area, particularly that of WKNA-FM, competing stations such as Mississippi Public Broadcasting duplicated some network offerings as well. Eventually, however, with the great expansion of public radio news and talk programming in the late 1990s, MSPCF decided to take advantage of it by splitting the network into two. With that, the Memphis and Jackson stations programmed classical music during the middle of the day and at night, news and information during rush hour, and weekly feature programs on the weekends. Meanwhile, the Dyersburg and Senatobia frequencies carried news, talk, and information shows from various public radio packagers and the BBC. On occasion, the four stations aired the same programming. =2007 translator sale= In early 2007, WKNO/MSPCF sold the Senatobia and Dyersburg stations, WKNA and WKNQ, to Christian broadcasters, with the American Family Association buying WKNA for the American Family Radio talk network (currently WMSB-FM), and the Educational Media Foundation buying WKNQ for its K-Love CCM network (currently WZKV-FM). MSPCF president Michael LaBonia said that WKNO's hopes to expand the coverage areas of the two stations were unsuccessful. He stated that WKNA's signal was barely listenable in northern Mississippi outside of a small radius, not even getting into metro Memphis, which led to the sale of the frequencies. The sale left the northwestern corner of Tennessee as one of the few areas in the U.S. without a clear signal from an NPR station, the closest signal being Murray, Kentucky's WKMS. According to the Memphis Flyer, MSPCF netted some $2.8 million from the transaction with the religious networks. Memphis Flyer, February 1, 2007 The coverage areas of WKNA and WKNQ also held a much smaller base of listener support than the core area WKNO/WKNP served due to their more rural coverage areas. =Current schedule= After the sale, WKNO/WKNP reconfigured its schedule to match most public radio stations, while still providing significant hours of classical music. The new lineup features NPR newscasts throughout the day; NPR news magazines, such as All Things Considered and Morning Edition in morning and afternoon drive time slots; Marketplace from American Public Media in the late afternoons; Fresh Air in the early evening; with local programming during the daytime on weekends, as well as the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts, and several lighthearted shows from NPR, APM, and PRI. Classical music is heard at other times. =HD Radio services= In late 2007, WKNO/WKNP began broadcasting digitally, so listeners with an HD radio are able to receive three streams. The first stream is a simulcast of the analog signal. A second stream alternates between NPR and American Public Media shows when classical music is broadcast on the first stream, and classical music when the first stream broadcasts NPR, PRI and APM spoken-word programming. The third stream offers 24/7 news from the BBC World Service, something previously available on WKNA and WKNQ.https://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=29 HD Radio Guide for Memphis, Tennessee References External links KNO-FM KNO-FM NPR member stations ","title":"WKNO-FM"},{"id":"4337658","text":"Paul B.

They are all in Forestry and Land Scotland forests and are known as the 7stanes because each venue features a 'stane' (Scots for stone), created by artist Gordon Young, somewhere along the forest trails. Trail Grades The trails use the Cyclists' Touring Club off-road trail grades with two additional categories, one called Bike Park and the other Forest Road and similar. *Green - Easy (relatively flat; suitable for beginners) *Blue - Moderate (may be singletrack and include minor obstacles; suitable for cyclists with basic off-road skills) *Red - Difficult (mostly singletrack, many obstacles; suitable for proficient mountain bikers) *Black - Severe (similar to red routes, with more obstacles and large challenging area; suitable for expert riders only) *Bike Park (Orange)- Extreme (highly challenging, includes downhill sections and unavoidable jumps; suitable for expert riders only) *Forest road and similar - these routes can be waymarked or not. The difficulty of forest roads can vary widely and this grade indicates these trails not part of a progression on to green and blue level singletrack trails. The 7stanes Sites =Ae= Located around 14 km north of Dumfries. Ae features a red-grade route with optional black-graded areas and two bike park- extreme downhill routes. For less experienced riders, green and blue trails are available. =Dalbeattie= This rocky site features a green-grade and blue-graded trail, along with a red-graded trail with optional black-graded sections. These include The Slab, a challenging steep granite rock. Nearest bike shops are Next Level Bikes, Castle Douglas Cycle Centre and MPG Cycles in Dalbeattie =Glentress and Innerleithen= Comprises two nearby sites close to Peebles in the Scottish Borders. Glentress is one of the best- equipped mountain biking sites in the UK, with a cafe, bike hire shop and showering/changing facilities. Trails include a green, blue, red and black route. There is also the skills loop- a green-graded area designed for those new to the sport and the Freeride Park which is graded bike park- extreme. This park is full of challenging technical features for experienced riders. A few miles to the south-east, Innerleithen features a red-graded cross-country trail (with black-graded options), and a bike park-extreme graded downhill area. This is a particularly challenging area and riders are recommended to wear body armour and a full-face helmet. A full trail centre has recently been completed with cafe and bike shop(Alpine Bikes) =Glentrool= Located in Galloway. Glentrool includes one 58 km road-based route (the only wholly road- based route in the 7stanes) one 9 km blue-graded route, and two green-graded routes (6 km and 14 km).Nearest bike shops are Brakehut open seasonally who hire bikes to Glentrool and Kirkcowan Cycles open year round and out of hours by appointment. =Kirroughtree= Located near Newton Stewart.

The photograph was taken by expedition leader Ernest Shackleton. The Nimrod Expedition of 1907‚Äì1909, otherwise known as the British Antarctic Expedition, was the first of three successful expeditions to the Antarctic led by Ernest Shackleton. Its main target, among a range of geographical and scientific objectives, was to be first to the South Pole. This was not attained, but the expedition's southern march reached a Farthest South latitude of 88¬∞ 23' S, just from the pole. This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole. A separate group led by Welsh Australian geology professor Edgeworth David reached the estimated location of the South Magnetic Pole, and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of Mount Erebus, Antarctica's second highest volcano. The expedition lacked governmental or institutional support, and relied on private loans and individual contributions. It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, Nimrod, was less than half of the size of Robert Falcon Scott's 1901‚Äì1904 expedition ship Discovery, and Shackleton's crew lacked relevant experience. Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in McMurdo Sound, close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so. Nevertheless, although the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future Australasian Antarctic Expedition leader Douglas Mawson, carried out extensive geological, zoological and meteorological work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on Manchurian ponies, motor traction, and sled dogs, were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition. On his return, Shackleton overcame the Royal Geographical Society's initial scepticism about his achievements and received many public honours, including a knighthood from King Edward VII. He made little financial gain from the expedition and eventually depended on a government grant to cover its liabilities. Within three years his southernmost record had been surpassed, as first Amundsen and then Scott reached the South Pole. In his own moment of triumph, Amundsen nevertheless observed: \\"Sir Ernest Shackleton's name will always be written in the annals of Antarctic exploration in letters of fire\\". Origins Sir William Beardmore, later Lord Invernairn Shackleton had been a junior officer on Scott's first Antarctic expedition in the Discovery. He had been sent home on the relief ship Morning in 1903, after a physical collapse during the expedition's main southern journey. Scott's verdict was that he \\"ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health\\". Shackleton felt this physical failure as a personal stigma, and on his return to England he was determined to prove himself, in the words of Discovery's second-in command Albert Armitage, as \\"a better man than Scott\\". He nevertheless declined the opportunity of a swift Antarctic return as chief officer of Discovery's second relief ship Terra Nova, after helping to fit her out; he also helped to equip Uruguay, the ship being prepared for the relief of Otto Nordenskjold's expedition, stranded in the Weddell Sea. During the next few years, while nursing intermittent hopes of resuming his Antarctic career, he pursued other options. In 1906 he was working for the industrial magnate Sir William Beardmore as a public relations officer. According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the references to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of ¬£17,000 (updated value ¬£) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a ¬£7,000 loan guarantee (updated value ¬£). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was the knowledge that the Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn. Preparations =Initial plans= Shackleton's original unpublished plan envisaged basing himself at the old Discovery Expedition headquarters in McMurdo Sound. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Other journeys would follow, and there would be a continuous programme of scientific work. This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and a specially designed motor vehicle. Neither ponies nor motor traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by Frederick Jackson during the Jackson- Harmsworth Arctic expedition of 1894‚Äì1897. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from Nansen, the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10. By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic ¬£30,000 (updated value ¬£). However, the response of the RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott. =Nimrod= The expedition's ship Nimrod departing for the South Pole Shackleton intended to arrive in Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and fit out a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart, Shackleton travelled to Norway intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, Bjorn, that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, Bjorn was beyond Shackleton's means. Bjorn was eventually acquired by German explorer Wilhelm Filchner and, renamed Deutschland, was used in his 1911‚Äì1913 voyage to the Weddell Sea. Shackleton had to settle for the elderly, much smaller Nimrod, a 40-year-old wooden sealer of 334 gross register tons, which he was able to acquire for ¬£5,000 (updated value ¬£). Shackleton was shocked by his first sight of Nimrod after her arrival in London from Newfoundland in June 1907. \\"She was much dilapidated and smelt strongly of seal oil, and an inspection [...] showed that she needed caulking and that her masts would have to be renewed.\\" However, in the hands of experienced ship-fitters she soon \\"assumed a more satisfactory appearance.\\" Later, Shackleton reported, he became extremely proud of the sturdy little ship. =Fundraising= By early July 1907 Shackleton had secured little financial support beyond Beardmore's guarantee and was lacking the funds to complete the refit of the ship. In mid-July he approached the philanthropic Earl of Iveagh, otherwise known as Edward Guinness, head of the Anglo-Irish brewing family, who agreed to guarantee the sum of ¬£2,000 (updated value ¬£) provided that Shackleton found other backers to contribute a further ¬£6,000. Shackleton was able to do this, the extra funds including ¬£2,000 from Sir Philip Brocklehurst, who paid this sum to secure a place on the expedition. A last-minute gift of ¬£4,000 from Shackleton's cousin William Bell still left the expedition far short of the required ¬£30,000, but enabled Nimrod's refit to be finished. Fundraising continued in Australia after the ship arrived there; a further ¬£5,000 was provided as a gift from the Government of Australia, and the New Zealand Government gave ¬£1,000. By these means, and with other smaller loans and donations, the ¬£30,000 was raised, although by the end of the expedition total costs had risen, by Shackleton's estimate, to ¬£45,000. Shackleton expected to make large sums from his book about the expedition and from lectures. He also hoped to profit from sales of special postage stamps bearing the cancellation stamp of the Antarctica post office that Shackleton, appointed temporary postmaster by the New Zealand government, intended to establish there. None of these schemes produced the anticipated riches, although the post office was set up at Cape Royds and used as a conduit for the expedition's mail. =Personnel= Prof. Edgeworth David, who headed the scientific team Shackleton hoped to recruit a strong contingent from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson the post of chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in. Shackleton's second-in-command‚Äîalthough this was not clarified until the expedition reached the Antarctic‚Äîwas Jameson Boyd Adams, a Royal Naval Reserve lieutenant who had turned down the chance of a regular commission to join Shackleton. He would also act as the expedition's meteorologist. Nimrod's captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old John King Davis, who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed chief officer at the last moment. Aeneas Mackintosh, a merchant navy officer from the P&O; shipping line, was originally second officer, but was later transferred to the shore party, being replaced as second officer by A. E. Harbord. Others in the shore party were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and Eric Marshall, Bernard Day the motor expert, and Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist. Douglas Mawson, a late addition to the scientific team The small scientific team that departed from England included 41-year-old biologist James Murray and 21-year-old geologist Raymond Priestley, a future founder of the Scott Polar Research Institute. Two important additions to the team were made in Australia. The first of these was Edgeworth David, a professor of geology at the University of Sydney, who became the party's chief scientific officer. The second was a former pupil of David's, Douglas Mawson, a lecturer in mineralogy at the University of Adelaide. Both had originally intended to sail to Antarctica and then immediately back with Nimrod but were persuaded to become full members of the expedition. David was influential in securing the Australian government's ¬£5,000 grant. Before departure for the Antarctic in August 1907, Joyce and Wild took a crash course in printing methods, as it was Shackleton's intention to publish a book or magazine while in the Antarctic. Promise to Scott Robert Falcon Scott Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander. Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\". The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170¬∞ W‚Äîeverything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land. Polar historian Beau Riffenburgh believes this was \\"a promise that should never ethically have been demanded and one that should never have been given, impacting as it might on the entire safety of Shackleton's expedition\\". The dispute soured relations between the two men (who nevertheless maintained public civilities), and would eventually lead to the complete rupture of Shackleton's formerly close friendship with Wilson. In his own account of the expedition Shackleton makes no reference to the wrangle with Scott. He merely states that \\"before we finally left England I had decided that if possible I would establish my base in King Edward VII Land instead of [...] McMurdo Sound\\". Expedition =Voyage south= After inspection by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, Nimrod sailed on 11 August 1907. Shackleton remained behind on expedition business; he and other expedition members followed on a faster ship. The entire complement came together in New Zealand, ready for the ship's departure to Antarctica on New Year's Day, 1908. As a means of conserving fuel, Shackleton had arranged with the New Zealand government for Nimrod to be towed to the Antarctic circle, a distance of approximately , the costs of the tow being met partly by the government and partly by the Union Steam Ship Company as a contribution to the expedition. On 14 January, in sight of the first icebergs, the towline was cut; Nimrod, under her own power, proceeded southward into the floating pack ice, heading for the Barrier Inlet where six years earlier Discovery had paused to allow Scott and Shackleton to take experimental balloon flights. The Barrier (later known as the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed significantly in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after the large number of whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound. =Cape Royds= Establishing the base Inside the Cape Royds Hut, winter 1908. Included in the picture are Shackleton (left background), Armytage (Standing background), Adams (smoking curved pipe), Wild (working on the sledge) and Joyce (extreme right, foreground). A poster advertising ladies' corsets hangs on the wall. On arriving in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrod's progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point was blocked by frozen sea. Shackleton decided to wait a few days in the hope that the ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season. On 3 February Shackleton decided not to wait for the ice to shift but to make his headquarters at the nearest practicable landing place, Cape Royds. Late that evening the ship was moored, and a suitable site for the expedition's prefabricated hut was selected. The site was separated from Hut Point by of sea, with no landward route to the south. Shackleton believed the party was \\"fortunate to get winter quarters as near as this to our starting point for the south.\\" The following days were occupied with the landing of stores and equipment. This work was hampered by poor weather and by the caution of Captain England, who frequently took the ship out into the bay until ice conditions at the landing ground were in his view safer. The next fortnight followed this pattern, leading to sharp dissent between Shackleton and the captain. At one point, Shackleton asked England to stand down on the grounds that he was ill, but England refused. The task of unloading became, in Riffenburgh's description, \\"mind-numbingly difficult\\" but was finally completed on 22 February. Nimrod at last sailed away north, England unaware that ship's engineer Harry Dunlop was carrying a letter from Shackleton to the expedition's New Zealand agent, requesting a replacement captain for the return voyage next year. This knowledge was an open secret among the shore party; Marshall recorded in his diary that he was \\"glad to see the last of [England] ... whole thing damned disgrace to name of country!\\" Ascent of Mount Erebus Mount Erebus After Nimrod's departure, the sea ice broke up, cutting off the party's route to the Barrier and thus making preparatory sledging and depot-laying impossible. Shackleton decided to give the expedition impetus by ordering an immediate attempt to ascend Mount Erebus. This mountain, high, had never been climbed. A party from Discovery (which had included Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce) had explored the foothills in 1904 but had not ascended higher than . Neither Wild nor Joyce was in the Nimrod Expedition's main Erebus party, which consisted of Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. With Marshall, Adams and Brocklehurst forming a support group, the ascent began on 5 March. On 7 March the two groups combined at around , and all advanced towards the summit. On the following day a blizzard held them up, but early on 9 March the climb resumed; later that day the summit of the lower, main crater, was achieved. By this time Brocklehurst's feet were too frostbitten for him to continue, so he was left in camp while the others advanced to the active crater, which they reached after four hours. Several meteorological experiments were carried out, and many rock samples were taken. Thereafter a rapid descent was made, mainly by sliding down successive snow-slopes. The party reached the Cape Royds hut \\"nearly dead\\", according to Eric Marshall, on 11 March. Winter 1908 The expedition's hut, a prefabricated structure measuring 33 x 19 feet (10m x 5.8m), was ready for occupation by the end of February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side of the hut, while the dog kennels were placed close to the porch. Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks‚Äîall lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton \\"had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it\\". In the ensuing months of winter darkness Joyce and Wild printed around 30 copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, was preparing for the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton had been able to reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content. =Southern journey= Outward march Shackleton's choice of a four-man team for the southern journey to the South Pole was largely determined by the number of surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march. The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey. The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised doubts about his fitness. The march began on 29 October 1908. Shackleton had calculated the return distance to the Pole as . His initial plan allowed 91 days for the return journey, requiring a daily average distance of about . After a slow start due to a combination of poor weather and lameness in the horses, Shackleton reduced the daily food allowance to extend the total available journey time to 110 days. This required a shorter daily average of around 13¬Ω nautical miles. Between 9 and 21 November they made good progress, but the ponies suffered on the difficult Barrier surface, and the first of the four had to be shot when the party reached 81¬∞ S. On 26 November a new farthest south record was established as they passed the 82¬∞ 17' mark set by Scott's southern march in December 1902. Shackleton's party covered the distance in 29 days compared with Scott's 59, using a track considerably east of Scott's to avoid the surface problems the earlier journey had encountered. As the group moved into unknown territory, the Barrier surface became increasingly disturbed and broken; two more ponies succumbed to the strain. The mountains to the west curved round to block their path southward, and the party's attention was caught by a \\"brilliant gleam of light\\" in the sky ahead., quoting Frank Wild's diary. The reason for this phenomenon became clear on 3 December when, after a climb through the foothills of the mountain chain, they saw before them what Shackleton later described as \\"an open road to the south, [...] a great glacier, running almost south to north between two huge mountain ranges\\". Shackleton christened this glacier the \\"Beardmore\\" after the expedition's biggest sponsor. Travel on the glacier surface proved to be a trial, especially for Socks, the remaining pony, who had great difficulty in finding secure footings. On 7 December, Socks disappeared down a deep crevasse, very nearly taking Wild with him. However, the pony's harness broke, and the sledge containing their supplies remained on the surface. For the rest of the southward journey and the whole of the return trip they had to rely on man-hauling. As the journey continued, personal antagonisms emerged. Wild privately expressed the wish that Marshall would \\"fall down a crevasse about a thousand feet deep\\".Wild, diary, quoted by . Marshall wrote that following Shackleton to the Pole was \\"like following an old woman. Always panicking\\". However, Christmas Day was celebrated with cr√®me de menthe and cigars. Their position was 85¬∞ 51' S, still from the Pole, and they were now carrying barely a month's supply of food, having stored the rest in depots for their return journey. They could not cover the remaining distance to the Pole and back with this amount of food. However, Shackleton was not yet prepared to admit that the Pole was beyond them and decided to go forward after cutting food rations further, and dumping all but the most essential equipment. On Boxing Day the glacier ascent was at last completed, and the march on the polar plateau began. Conditions did not ease; Shackleton recorded 31 December as the \\"hardest day we have had\\". On the next day he noted that, having attained 87¬∞ 6¬Ω‚Ä≤ S, they had beaten North and South polar records.. The North reference was to Peary's then farthest north of 87¬∞ 6' N. That day, referring to Marshall and Adams, Wild wrote: \\"if we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of those two grubscoffing useless beggars we would have done it [the Pole] easily.\\" On 4 January 1909, Shackleton finally accepted that the Pole was beyond them, and revised his goal to the symbolic achievement of getting within 100 geographical miles of the Pole. The party struggled on, at the borders of survival, until on 9 January 1909, after a last dash forward without the sledge or other equipment, the march ended. \\"We have shot our bolt\\", wrote Shackleton, \\"and the tale is 88¬∞ 23' S\\". They were 97.5 geographical miles from the South Pole. The British flag was duly planted, and Shackleton named the polar plateau after King Edward VII. Return journey On the return journey. The party reach a depot on the Great Ice Barrier The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\". The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\".Wild diary, quoted in . A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. Wild, Shackleton, Marshall and Adams aboard Nimrod after their southern journey \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\". Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut Point before the 1 March deadline. The final leg of their march was interrupted by a blizzard, which held them in camp for 24 hours. On 27 February, when they were still from safety, Marshall collapsed. Shackleton then decided that he and Wild would make a dash for Hut Point in hopes of finding the ship and holding her until the other two could be rescued. They reached the hut late on 28 February. Hoping that the ship was nearby, they sought to attract its attention by setting fire to a small wooden hut used for magnetic observations. Shortly afterwards Nimrod, which had been anchored at the Glacier Tongue, came into view: \\"No happier sight ever met the eyes of man\\", wrote Wild later. It was a further three days before Adams and Marshall could be picked up from the Barrier, but by 4 March the whole southern party was aboard and Shackleton was able to order full steam towards the north. =Northern Party= While preparing for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David to lead a Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party was to try to reach the Magnetic Pole, and was to carry out a full geological survey in the Dry Valley area. David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work. The party had orders to plant the Union Jack at the Magnetic Pole and to take possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire. After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car. (l. to r.) Mackay, Edgeworth David, and Mawson at the Southern Magnetic Pole, 17 January 1909 Due to sea ice conditions and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By the end of October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60 miles (100 km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and the treacherous Drygalski Glacier they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson. (David's account). Their way up to the inland plateau was via a labyrinthine glacier (later named the Reeves Glacier after the Royal Geographical Society's main map curator), which brought them on 27 December to a hard snow surface. This enabled them to move more swiftly, at a rate of about daily, taking regular magnetic observations. On 16 January, these observations showed them to be about from the Magnetic Pole. The next day, 17 January 1909, they reached their goal, fixing the pole's position as 72¬∞ 15' S, 155¬∞ 16' E, at an elevation of . In a muted ceremony, David took formal possession of the area for the British Empire. Exhausted, and short of food, the party faced a return journey of , with just 15 days to complete it if they were to make their prearranged coastal rendezvous with Nimrod. Despite increasing physical weakness they maintained their daily distances, and on 31 January were from their agreed pick-up point. Bad weather delayed them, and the rendezvous was not reached until 2 February. That night, in heavy drifting snow, Nimrod passed by them, unable to make out their camp. Two days later, however, after Nimrod had turned south again, the group was spotted from the ship and was able to scramble to safety, although in the rush to get aboard Mawson fell down a crevasse. The party had been travelling for four months and were wearing the same clothes in which they had departed Cape Royds; reportedly \\"the aroma was overpowering\\". Before this rescue, Nimrod had picked up a geological party consisting of Priestley, Brocklehurst and , who had been carrying out geological work in the Ferrar Glacier region. Aftermath Sir Ernest Shackleton: \\"What Nansen is to the North, Shackleton is to the South\\"‚ÄîRoald Amundsen On 23 March 1909, Shackleton landed in New Zealand and cabled a 2,500-word report to the London Daily Mail, with which he had an exclusive contract. Amid the acclamation and unstinting praise that Shackleton received from the exploring community, including Nansen and Amundsen, the response of the Royal Geographical Society was more guarded. Its former president, Sir Clements Markham, privately expressed his disbelief of Shackleton's claimed latitude. However, on 14 June, Shackleton was met at London's Charing Cross Station by a very large crowd, which included RGS president Leonard Darwin and a rather reluctant Captain Scott. As to the latitude claimed, the reason for doubting its accuracy was that after 3 January all positions had been computed by dead reckoning: on direction, speed and elapsed time. The last proper observation, on 3 January had calculated the latitude as 87¬∞ 22'. Shackleton's table of distances show that over the next three days they covered just over , to reach an estimated 88¬∞ 7' on 6 January. They were then held up for two days by a blizzard. On 9 January 1909, the table shows that the party travelled a further to reach their farthest south, and the same distance back to camp. This distance in a single day far exceeded those for any other stage of the journey. Shackleton explained that this was a dash, \\"half running, half walking\\", unencumbered by the sledge or other equipment. Each of the four men independently confirmed his belief in the latitude achieved, and none gave any subsequent cause for his word to be doubted. Shackleton was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) by King Edward, who later conferred a knighthood on him. The RGS presented him with a gold medal, although apparently with reservations‚Äî\\"We do not propose to make the Medal so large as that which was awarded to Captain Scott\\", recorded an official. Although in the eyes of the public he was a hero, the riches that Shackleton had anticipated failed to materialise. The soaring costs of the expedition and the need to meet loan guarantees meant that he was saved from financial embarrassment only by a belated government grant of ¬£20,000. The farthest south record of the Nimrod Expedition stood for less than three years, until Amundsen reached the South Pole on 15 December 1911. For his trail-breaking achievements, Shackleton received a fulsome tribute from Amundsen: \\"What Nansen is to the North, Shackleton is to the South\\". Thereafter, Shackleton's Antarctic ambitions were fixed on a transcontinental crossing, which he attempted unsuccessfully with the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914‚Äì17, although his status as a leading figure in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was by then assured. Other members of the Nimrod Expedition also achieved fame and standing in future years. Edgeworth David, Adams, Mawson and Priestley all eventually received knighthoods, the latter two continuing their polar work on further expeditions, though neither went south again with Shackleton. Mawson led the 1911‚Äì13 Australian Antarctic Expedition, and Priestley was part of the Terra Nova Expedition's scientific team. Frank Wild was second-in-command to the \\"Boss\\" on the Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition and on the short Quest Expedition where he took over command after Shackleton's death in South Georgia in 1922. Ten years after her return from the Antarctic, Nimrod was battered to pieces in the North Sea, after running aground on the Barber Sands off the Norfolk (UK) coast on 31 January 1919. Only two of her 12-person crew survived. Several mostly intact cases of whisky and brandy left behind at Cape Royds in 1909 were recovered in 2010, for analysis by a distilling company. A revival of the vintage (and since lost) formula for the particular brands found has been offered for sale with a portion of the proceeds to benefit the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust which discovered the lost spirits.

The 2019-2020 school year has around 1330 students enrolled in the school. Holy Trinity is a member of the Halton Catholic District School Board. History Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School is a Catholic high school located in North Oakville in the River Oaks area within Oakville, Ontario. The school‚Äôs construction was completed in the summer of 2002 and the school opened to new students and staff in September 2002. The school initially had only Grade 9, Grade 10 and Grade 11 students. This was Holy Trinity's first year open and the size was approximately 800 students, while the 2018-2019 student and staff member count has more than doubled in size. The 2019-2020 school year has around 1330 students enrolled in the school. Holy Trinity fosters a respectful and supportive Catholic environment that inspires all students to reach their full potential. Holy Trinity offers students a comprehensive academic curriculum, an outstanding co-curricular program, and an important Catholic learning experience that will prepare them for their post-secondary goals. HT‚Äôs legendary and daily saying is ‚Äútreat everyone with equity, dignity, and respect‚Äù. Holy Trinity offers many specialty programs such as the most recent Advanced Placement (AP) program for grade 9 students (September 2017), Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) Program, Dual Credit Course with Sheridan College and other various technology courses. Interestingly, the school is a twin build of Christ the King Catholic Secondary School in Georgetown, Ontario. The blueprints of this school are a mirror image of Holy Trinity's and both schools were opened in September 2002. Portable or relocatable classrooms There are currently an additional eight (8) portable classrooms situated on site for the 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 school years. In fall 2007, two separate fires ran through several portables, causing many to be replaced. Portable One was removed following the first fire and 6 years later has yet to be replaced, leaving no portable that is numbered with the number \\"1.\\" These individual classrooms are placed outside of the original school building to accommodate the excess student enrollment over the building capacity of 1200 students as set by the Ontario Ministry of Education. Student enrollment in the 2007-2008 school year was a 36% enrollment increase above the permanent build facility level approved by the Ministry when the school was completed in 2002. History in Ontario has shown that many of these relocatable/portable classrooms will in fact be on site at the school for 15 to 20 or more years. As of 2017 the school has not used portable classrooms for at least 2 school years. No provision is made by the Ministry for important and needed specialty classrooms for these additional students enrolled beyond the official building capacity. Academic areas needing additional academic specialized facilities for the additional four hundred students in excess of the official 1200 capacity, are in the areas of science labs, computer labs and technical education classrooms. Extra-curricular activities Holy Trinity does offer many extracurricular activities. However, they are mainly oriented around team and individual sports: Boys ~ Football, Curling, Badminton, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Volleyball, Soccer, Swimming, Rugby, Baseball, Cross Country, Track and Field, Wrestling Girls ~ Basketball, Badminton, ice hockey, Volleyball, Soccer, Swimming, Field Hockey, Rugby, Tennis, Cross Country, Track and Field, Fastball. The school offers a selection of open participation extracurricular activities. Musical options include a Senior and Junior Concert Bands, Jazz Band under the direction of Mr. Michael Stanlake. Extracurricular groups, clubs, and teams include an Environment Club, Quidditch Team, Debate Team, FIRST Robotics Competition Team (Tronic Titans 3161), Chess Team, and Ski Team. The school also has a very successful Student Council. Holy Trinity's Student Council consists of two representatives from each grade and 2 co-presidents. Council runs many school events such as dances, spirit days and assembly's. Grade's 10-12 can run for council at the end of the school year, while grade nine's run in September.

Trinity Live Arts A Scene From The HT Musical Called \\"The Gamblers\\" Holy Trinity has been under the guidance of Mrs. Lanna Borsellino, who retired in 2018. Theatre Trinity has always been a large part of the school and has sparked the creation of a new student club, the Student Teacher Arts Representatives (STAR) council. The STAR council has hosted an annual ‚ÄúFringe Festival‚Äù which consist of student directed one act plays, this normally happens around Christmas time in the first semester. Second semester, the school normally takes on a larger production in a big play or musical lead by the head of the schools drama department. In the Spring of 2017, the school put on a production of Tim Rice‚Äôs ‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar‚Äù and starred seniors Olivia Ouzounis, Jacob Moro, and Luca D‚ÄôAmico. In the spring of 2018, the school put on a production of Frank Loesser ‚ÄúGuys and Dolls‚Äù and starred seniors Jackson Bulthuis, Jordan Lie, Brianna Mele, and Daniel Cabraja. Below is an image of ‚ÄúThe Gamblers‚Äù as well as an image of the iconic ‚ÄúHavana‚Äù scene. HT's adaptation of Charles Dickens‚Äô ‚ÄúA Christmas Carol‚Äù For Mrs. Borsellino‚Äôs final Theatre Trinity Production in the winter of 2018, the school put on an adaptation of Charles Dickens‚Äô ‚ÄúA Christmas Carol‚Äù which starred seniors Daniel Cabraja, Martin Bevcic, Joelle Mason, and Andrey Renkema. The school is looking into putting on a production of Victor Hugo‚Äôs ‚ÄúLes Mis√©rables‚Äù as their school musical for the spring of 2020, lead by the new head of arts department Ms. Christine Deif. Trinity Live Arts produces one annual school production, directed and choreographed by the teachers from all sections of the Arts Department. Past shows include: Fame (2004), Dracula (2005), Kids Say The Darndest Things (2006), Footloose (2007), The Donnellys (2008), The Wiz (2009) & Metamorphoses (2010). 2008 marked the first year the school participated in the Sears Drama Festival (held at Burlington Central High School). In 2009, Holy Trinity hosted the festival as \\"Red Carpet Nights\\". Past Sears Drama shows include: No Exit (2008), Inspector Rex (2009) & the original Bollywood musical, Bombay the Hard Way (2010). The After-School Drama Club was introduced in 2009, allowing students to be both directors and actors in their own productions. Once a year the school holds a challenge for all students who seek to get into filmmaking. The Five Hour film challenge takes place once a year. A team of five students must create a short film in under five hours with a specific line depending on whatever our STAR (Student. Teacher. Arts. Representatives) council chooses it to be. Students must pay fifteen dollars that covers, a bus to and from downtown oakville, and a pizza lunch. The winning team will all be awarded medals and their names inscribed on a plaque in the school. Down below is unused concept art for a poster for the 2017 five hour film challenge: Every year, Holy Trinity‚Äôs own S.T.A.R council holds a Christmas Assembly in the Gym that brings the whole school together to celebrate the holiday. The assembly is particularly well liked, and the students look forward to it, as it means the Christmas break is fast approaching. In past years, the assemblies had been fun and interactive, getting students involved and bringing out the Christmas spirit before the break begins. The assembly usually involves games, fun video clips put together by the S.T.A.R (Student. Teacher. Arts. Representatives) members, and sometimes dance routines and/or skits. Hopefully the coming years can be just as exciting and interactive as previous Christmas assemblies, continuing to get the student body into the Christmas spirit and sent off into the break on a good note. Robotics =2007= Two of the students at Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School (HT) became involved in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams at schools in the area, Team 1334 and Team 843. The students got interested teachers and students involved in other teams in the area until it was possible to start a team at HT. To aid in the process, Team 1334 graciously opened their doors for anyone interested to join their team. This collaboration continued in 2008 and 2009 with several Holy Trinity students and teachers actively participating on team 1334. =2010= Holy Trinity has a FIRST Robotics Competition team, Team 3161, their Twitter is @team3161 - Tronic Titans, whose first years as a rookie team was the 2010 season. In their rookie year, team 3161 seeded well at the Waterloo Regional, and qualified for the FIRST Championship in Atlanta, Georgia as rookie all-stars. =2011= The Tronic Titans greatly increased their activity within the school and the community. 3161 visited numerous local catholic elementary schools and from those efforts, started and mentored two new FLL teams. Team 3161 competed in the Waterloo and Greater Toronto West Regionals but due to unfortunate mechanical issues, team 3161 was limited to quarter finalists at both events. The team received the Team Spirit award at both events, and at Waterloo. Their own Paul Fossenier received the Dean‚Äôs List Finalist Award. =2012= The team had its first annual FIRST social for neighbouring FRC and FLL teams. The team hosted its second successful Halton Regional FLL tournament and recruited students from surrounding high schools to the team. The team appeared in TV Ontario‚Äôs show ‚ÄòGiver‚Äô, and hosted the Professional Engineers Ontario, Oakville Chapter‚Äôs, National Engineering Month Celebration. The team attended the Waterloo Regional, where they battled hard for the #1 seed but ended up seeded 3rd overall and became the 3rd alliance captain. They entered the elimination round but unfortunately did not pass the quarter finals. 3161 came home with a Woodie Flowers Finalist Award for their lead mentor Roger Balech. After Waterloo, 3161 was able to seed 1st overall, out of 55 teams, and captained the #1 alliance. =2013= The Tronic Titans became ever more community based, being composed of 38 students from seven different high schools and elementary schools in the area. They also managed to create stronger partnerships with their sponsors Anubis Manufacturing Corporation and Professional Engineers Ontario ‚Äì Oakville Chapter. The robot Perses‚Äô design included a ten-point hanger, a three-point shooter, and a five-disk autonomous. At the Waterloo regional, they were chosen as the first pick for the 5th alliance. At their second regional, GTR West, they were the 8th alliance captain, but at both regionals they didn‚Äôt make it past the quarter finals. =2014= They reached the World Championship in St. Louis by winning the Engineering Inspiration at Greater East Toronto Regional. They also won the Innovation in Control Award at the Waterloo Regional for the claw and punch design they have on their robot Thanatos. They earned high rankings in both regionals as well. They were the 5th alliance‚Äôs pick at Greater Toronto East, and they were the 8th alliance captains in Waterloo. They continued many established traditional events that the team holds, such as the Halton FLL Qualifying Tournament happened in their school remains the largest in Ontario. They come in partnership with PEO to hold their annual National Engineering Month. =2015= At Waterloo they were the final pick of the 3rd alliance. As a result, they were carried to the semi-finals. They remained the largest tournament held in Ontario. In March, they hosted the National Engineering Month with PEO. They successfully attracted more than two hundred people in attendance. They travelled to University of Toronto to take part in the Science Rendezvous fair. They held their largest fundraiser Ford Drive in partnership with Oakland Ford Dealership. =2019= There is a March 22-23 Competition at Waterloo and an April 5th Competition at McMaster.

He would lead the Indians to a sixth-place finish and a 66-87 record. He began his professional career in his native Marietta, Ohio. In 1902, he was playing for the Hartford Senators in the Connecticut League, and was expected to play for the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League the following year. However, in the fall of 1902 his knee was severely injured during a benefit game in Marietta, and he was unable to play for two years. After working as an umpire in 1905, he became a manager of the Portsmouth Cobblers of the Ohio State League in 1909; he later managed the Akron team in the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania and Central leagues. In 1913, the Indians hired him as a coach and scout. McCallister was Tris Speaker's primary assistant during his years as player-manager (1919‚Äì1926). McCallister became manager after Speaker's sudden resignation in late 1926. A second-place team in 1926, the Indians entered the 1927 season with a largely unchanged roster, except that Hall of Fame center fielder Speaker now played in Washington; the team won twenty-two fewer games in 1927.

History =Hodge Podge Lodge (1980s‚Äì1994)= From the late 1980s to 1994, CBC's two- hour morning block of children's programs was called Hodge Podge Lodge (not to be confused with the American series of the same name). CBC's afternoon children's programs during this time were presented under generic CBC branding instead. CBC Children's Publicist Barbara Chernin and Producer Stephen Wrigh came up with the \\"Hodge Podge Lodge\\" moniker. Angela Bruce, Head of CBC Children's Programming, consented to the name for the lineup. The Hodge Podge Lodge interstitials featured animated multi-coloured geometric shapes, art supplies, and blocks moving around to music. Following CBC's rebrand in November 1992, the Hodge Podge Lodge interstitials were replaced with new ones featuring a group of animated animals. A new character was introduced and a contest was held to name the character. =CBC Playground (1994‚Äì2000)= Former theatre director Peter Moss became CBC's head of children's programming in 1993, and the following winter, the CRTC complained about CBC's lack of children's programming and presence of U.S. shows on weekday afternoons. On October 24, 1994, the lineup was renamed CBC Playground; the block expanded to 9:30 a.m. with a half-hour block of children's series from around the world. European series requiring narration were recorded in Toronto with the voices of Martha Henry, Colm Feore and Albert Schultz. CBC said all programs between 9:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. will be Canadian within two years, as twelve shows for the block's first half-hour went into development. In 1998, Adrian Mills became CBC's new head of daytime programming, and CBC Playground was relaunched and expanded by an hour. Two presenters, Lisa Richardson and Drew Carnwath, were added to the block, and virtual sets began to be used. CBC became a partner in the Get Set For Life campaign, which aimed to share information on development in preschoolers, alongside non-profit parenting organization Invest in Kids and Canadian Living magazine. CBC Playgrounds \\"Parenting with the Zap Family\\" interstitials were produced as part of the campaign. =Get Set For Life (2000‚Äì2003)= In 2000, CBC Playground was replaced with Get Set For Life, a block named after the campaign of the same name. This iteration had Alyson Court and Michael Clarke as its hosts. =Kids' CBC (2003‚Äì2016)= \\"Kids' CBC\\" logo from 2003 to 2016. Kids' CBC started in 2003, replacing Get Set For Life. Previous hosts Court and Clarke continued to appear until December 2005, but the main focus was on five regional hosts from various parts of Canada. The hosts were Patty Sullivan (Ontario), Joyce Quansah (Quebec), Kush Uppal (British Columbia/Western Canada), Hayley Gene (Manitoba/Prairies), and Dashi Malone (Newfoundland and Labrador/Atlantic Canada). The look and the studio sets had also been drastically changed. The child seen in the Get Set For Life logo was redesigned into a separate animated character named Dot. On December 24, 2005, a set consisting of a garden in a geometric type dome was added to the block (the block previously featured animated interstitials in which the presenters would appear). Malone and Gene were replaced by Mark O'Brien and Holly Bernier. In 2007, the garden was removed. The set was changed to a Canadian village-type setting that had a circle floor and a treehouse was added. Due to the CBC's budget restrictions, the show was restricted to being hosted from Toronto by Sullivan, with Sid Bobb coming in as a co-host. New characters arrived to feature various parts of Canadian culture, each representing a different Canadian region: * Mamma Yamma is a yam that represents Ontario. She is the owner of a fruit and vegetable stand in Toronto's Kensington Market. * Drumheller is a skeleton dinosaur that represents Western Canada. He is from the archaeological site near Drumheller, Alberta. * Saumon de Champlain is a fictionalized salmon version of Samuel de Champlain that represents Quebec, who lives at the Ch√¢teau Frontenac in Quebec City. * Captain Claw is a lobster that represents Atlantic Canada. He is a lighthouse keeper in Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia. * Canada is a green, abstract animated representation of the map of the eponymous country. Each of the puppets were used in a variety of scenes in their local setting, typically educational in nature. Mamma Yamma would frequently host cameos by visiting celebrities such as musicians or Canadian television personalities; a compilation album of live performances, Mamma Yamma and Friends, was released in 2008. In 2013, the Kids' CBC style was changed. Drumheller, Saumon, Captain Claw, and Canada were removed. A new theme song titled \\"You and Me and Kids' CBC\\" was added. New segments were also added. =CBC Kids (2017‚Äìpresent)= On June 23, 2016, CBC announced that Kids' CBC would be rebranded as CBC Kids the following winter. Presenters Sullivan and Bobb were removed. Mamma Yamma was also removed. CBC Kids replaced Kids' CBC on January 2, 2017. The current hosts of this block are Janaye Upshaw and Tony Kim.

Musicians Harry Connick, Jr. and Branford Marsalis teamed up with Habitat for Humanity International and New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity to create the village for New Orleans musicians who lost their homes to Hurricane Katrina. Per February 2007, the Musicians' Village is \\"the largest-scale, highest-profile, and biggest-budget rebuilding project to have gotten underway in New Orleans post-Katrina. Planning Habitat for Humanity and New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity, working with Harry Connick Jr. and Branford Marsalis, announced their plans in December 2005 for a \\"Musicians' Village\\" in New Orleans. On Friday, January 6, 2006, the governing board for New Orleans public schools approved the sale of of surplus property in the Upper 9th Ward to the New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity. New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity was the only bidder for the advertised property. The board unanimously approved the $676,500 sale. The core property was a residential area for decades and the former site of Kohn Junior High School, which was razed. The land covers two city blocks bounded by North Roman, Alvar and North Johnson streets. It also includes parts of three other blocks along what once was Bartholomew Street‚Äîthe stretch between North Johnson and North Derbigny streets. Another Habitat project, in the same area, is the Baptist Crossroads Project. The idea of bringing music back to New Orleans was popular, and by September 2006 the entire area, including the Baptist Crossroads project, was known and referred to as Musicians Village. The Baptist Crossroads Project was thought up in 2004, by David Crosby, pastor of First Baptist Church of New Orleans, and initially planned to build 40 houses, a $3 million project, funded in part by a $1.5 million matching grant from Baptist Community Ministries. After Hurricane Katrina hit, they partnered with Habitat for Humanity New Orleans, and the building began on June 6, 2006. Thirty homes were completed between June and August 2006, and Baptist Crossroads hoped to build 100 houses in the same area over the subsequent two years, according to project coordinator Inman Houston. Before construction had begun, Brian Williams and the NBC Nightly News crew met with Harry Connick, Jr., Branford Marsalis, Ellis Marsalis, New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity (NOAHH) Executive Director Jim Pate, and NBC Universal Chairman and CEO Bob Wright, in the Upper Ninth Ward, Jan. 23, 2006. A raised platform, instruments, microphones and amplifiers were put up, and Connick, Marsalis and other musicians warmed up by playing themes to television shows‚Äîbefore giving a live jazz performance. Construction President George W. Bush is greeted by the New Birth Brass Band on August 29, 2006, at the Habitat for Humanity's Musician's Village. Keys to the first three houses were given on June 1, 2006. New homeowners Fredy Omar con su Banda and Jerome Deleno \\"J.D.\\" Hill - with \\"J.D. and the Jammers\\" - played for the 300 or more people who had gathered for the dedication ceremony and party. Politicians George W. Bush, Kathleen Blanco, Ray Nagin and Bill Jefferson volunteered at the Musicians' Village on April 27, 2006. They put on tool belts and hoisted triangular roof beam sections up to workers scampering across the wooden skeletons of new houses. Then they went inside the framework, talked with individual volunteers, before Nagin and Bush climbed up and started hammering nails handed up to them by Blanco and Jefferson. Hootie & The Blowfish brought their band and crew to New Orleans for five days of building houses, on October 16‚Äì20, 2006. Former president Jimmy Carter worked in December 2006. Barack Obama took part in painting a home, held discussions, received a tour of the area and was entertained with music by J.D. Hill. Karekin II, leader of the Armenian Apostolic Church, helped build a home on October 17, 2007, and senator John Edwards helped on January 30, 2008. Buildings Homes being built as part of the Musician's Village Project on June 1, 2007. The New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity (NOAHH) built 70 single-family homes, as well as 5 two-family homes for older musicians and a music center in the core area of the Musicians' Village. The houses are designed with two, three, and four bedrooms. Homes are being built a foot above the flood level in the area, , 7-inches off the ground. Habitat will use a total of seven different traditional New Orleans facades that will sometimes be flipped left to right. =Ellis Marsalis Center for Music= A centerpiece of the village is the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music, dedicated to celebrating the music and musicians of New Orleans and to the education and development of homeowners and others who live nearby. The center features indoor and outdoor performance spaces as well as practice rooms and classrooms. The center has 51 off-street parking spaces. The center will be managed by the nonprofit foundation New Orleans Habitat Musicians Village Inc. The two-story center contains a 170-seat theater and performance hall with movable seats, including dressing and practice rooms. A courtyard with a retractable roof will be between this center and a smaller community center that will contain meeting rooms, offices, classrooms and a community Internet room. Harry Connick Jr. and Branford Marsalis have been \\"heavily involved in the design process\\" of the center, according to Jim Pate. In April 2007, the plans for the building won approval from the City Planning Commission. Engineers began grading the site in May, 2007. The groundbreaking was kicked off on September 13, 2007, with a celebration that included performances from Bob French and the Original Tuxedo Band and Shamarr Allen Combo, with guest artists Harry Connick Jr. and Branford Marsalis sitting in. The Ellis Marsalis Center for Music opened at the end of August 2011 in New Orleans's Upper 9th Ward.

Unlike most species of fresh-water algae, it is cryophilic (cold-loving) and thrives in freezing water. This type of snow is common during the summer in alpine and coastal polar regions worldwide, such as the Sierra Nevada of California. Here, at altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000 feet (3,000‚Äì3,600 m), the temperature is cold throughout the year, and so the snow has lingered from winter storms. Compressing the snow by stepping on it or making snowballs leaves it looking red. Walking on watermelon snow often results in getting bright red soles and pink trouser cuffs. Snow algae dominates glacial biomass immediately after the onset of melting, and its pigmentation can significantly darken the surface of a glacier. This plays a substantial role in glacial melt.Lutz S, Anesio AM, Raiswell R, et al. The biogeography of red snow microbiomes and their role in melting arctic glaciers. Nature Communications. 2016 Jun;7:11968. DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11968. History The earliest accounts of watermelon snow are in the writings of Aristotle. Watermelon snow has puzzled mountain climbers, explorers, and naturalists for thousands of years, some speculating that it was caused by mineral deposits or oxidation products that were leached from rocks. In May 1818, four ships sailed from England to search for the Northwest Passage and chart the Arctic coastline of North America. Severe weather made them finally turn the ships back, but the expedition made valuable contributions to science. Captain John Ross noticed crimson snow that streaked the white cliffs like streams of blood as they were rounding Cape York on the northwest coast of Greenland. A landing party stopped and brought back samples to England. The Times wrote about this discovery on December 4, 1818: A follow-up article three days later erroneously concluded that the coloration was caused by meteoric iron deposits: Unusual watermelon snow pits, superimposed with an orange-ish bootprintTracks made by sliding on watermelon snow in Utah's Uinta Mountains When Ross published his account of the voyage in 1818, it contained a botanical appendix by Robert Brown. In it, Brown tentatively attributed the red snow to an alga. The phenomenon was also reported from the Scottish Highlands in the nineteenth century and subsequently recorded scientifically from a snowpatch in the Cairngorm Mountains in 1967.A snow microflora in the Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/370009780343798.pdf Chlamydomonas nivalis Chlamydomonas nivalis is a green alga that owes its red color to a bright red carotenoid pigment, which protects the chloroplast from intense visible and also ultraviolet radiation, as well as absorbing heat, which provides the alga with liquid water as the snow melts around it. Algal blooms may extend to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches), with each cell measuring about 20 to 30 micrometers in diameter, about four times the diameter of a human red blood cell. It has been calculated that a teaspoon of melted snow contains a million or more cells. The algae sometimes accumulate in \\"sun cups\\", which are shallow depressions in the snow. The carotenoid pigment absorbs heat and as a result it deepens the sun cups, and accelerates the melting rate of glaciers and snowbanks. During the winter months, when snow covers them, the algae become dormant. In spring, nutrients, increased levels of light and meltwater, stimulate germination. Once they germinate, the resting cells release smaller green flagellate cells which travel towards the surface of the snow. Once the flagellated cells reach the surface, they may lose their flagellae and form aplanospores, or thick-walled resting cells, or they may function as gametes, fusing in pairs to form zygotes. Many species feed on C. nivalis, including protozoans such as ciliates, rotifers, nematodes, ice worms and springtails.

The hall is inside the Tokyo Dome City, it is one of Tokyo's biggest attractions. It opened on April 16, 1962, and has a capacity of approximately 2,005 people. The venue hosted the boxing events for the 1964 Summer Olympics. In the area of pro wrestling, it is considered the Madison Square Garden of puroresu, as all of Japan's largest promotions have run some of their larger shows there, much akin to the WWF/E's monthly show at MSG in the 1980s. In March 2011, as the hall suffered structural damage under the influence of the T≈çhoku earthquake, the events scheduled for the time being, including WBC triple female world title fight, were postponed or canceled. The repair work was completed on March 18. The Hall was closed until the next day, then gradually resumed a variety of events. On October 27, 2016, the hall became the chosen venue for the International Lethwei Federation Japan. The Lethwei Grand Prix Japan 2016 was the first event of the promotion held at the venue.

He started his career with Br√∏ndby IF, winning the 2005 Danish Superliga. He holds the record of Denmark national youth team matches, with a combined 93 matches and 15 goals at various youth levels. He played a single match for the Denmark national football team. He was a speedy player and was known for his skills to shoot at goal from distance. During his career he had offers from Ajax, Portsmouth, Schalke 04, Espanyol, Hannover and Sion that did not amount to anything. Club career = Br√∏ndby IF = Born in N√∏rre Alslev, Kamper made his senior debut for Br√∏ndby IF in the 2002‚Äì03 Danish Superliga season which ended with a runners-up silver medal. He was also a part of the Br√∏ndby team which won the 2003 Danish Cup. The following two years, Kamper missed only three league matches, as he scored 11 goals in 63 league matches, and Kamper was a constant part of the Br√∏ndby team during the 2004‚Äì05 Danish Superliga championship winning season. He completed the Double with the team, as Br√∏ndby also won the 2005 Danish Cup. With the arrival of new signings Danish international player Thomas Rasmussen and Swedish international player Martin Ericsson, Kamper faced stiff competition for a place in the starting line-up in the 2005‚Äì06 Danish Superliga season. He played only 19 of 33 games that season. = Arminia Bielefeld = In the summer of 2006, Kamper moved abroad to play for Arminia Bielefeld in the German Bundesliga championship. In September 2006, Kamper scored his first Bielefeld goal on a free kick, to win the match against defending Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich 2‚Äì1. He scored six goals in 29 games during his first Bundesliga season. In March 2009, Kamper suffered an injury, and spent two months in recovery. He returned to the team for the last two games of the season, but could not prevent Bielefeld from being relegated to the German 2. Bundesliga.

Located directly across the street from the Virginia State Capitol, it has long been a popular house of worship for political figures, including General Robert E. Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis (earning it the nickname \\"the Cathedral of the Confederacy\\"). Davis was a member. Other notable people associated with the church are Rev. Dr. Charles Minnigerode, who led the church during the Civil War and Reconstruction eras. The Right. Rev. John Shelby Spong, now retired as bishop of the Diocese of Newark, began to attract national attention while rector of St. Paul's (1969‚Äì1976). St. Paul's was built in 1845 as a branch of the Monumental Church, which had outgrown its building. The Greek Revival church was designed by Thomas Somerville Stewart and modeled largely on St. Luke's Church, now Church of St. Luke & the Epiphany, in Philadelphia. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as St. Paul's Church. The corner stone was laid on 10-Oct-1843 according to the St. Paul's History book. Interestingly, we have not found said corner stone. Consecration was 11-Nov-1845. The same book estimates the probable cost, before construction, as \\"not exceeding $53,500\\". That excludes the organ and lot. Later an approximation of $55,000 is given. Organ is estimated at $4,000 and lot was $6,000 and then an additional lot was added for $1,075.

The service is entrusted to conduct diplomacy and manage foreign relations of India. It is the body of career diplomats serving in more than 162 Indian Diplomatic Missions and International Organisations around the world. In addition, they serve at the headquarters of the Ministry of External affairs in Delhi and the Prime Minister's Office. They also head the Regional Passport Offices throughout the country and hold positions in the President's Secretariat and several ministries on deputation. The administrative and political heads are respectively the Foreign Secretary and the External Affairs Minister. History South Block The HQ of Ministry of External Affairs, Prime Minister's Office and Defence Ministry in New Delhi US President Obama and Indian Prime Minister Modi are with their diplomats in an expanded bilateral meeting at Hyderabad House, New Delhi.alt= On 13 September 1783, the board of directors of the East India Company passed a resolution at Fort William, Calcutta (now Kolkata), to create a department, which could help \\"relieve the pressure\\" on the Warren Hastings administration in conducting its \\"secret and political business.\\" Although established by the Company, the Indian Foreign Department conducted business with foreign European powers. From the very beginning, a distinction was maintained between the foreign and political functions of the Foreign Department; relations with all \\"Asiatic powers\\" (including native princely states) were treated as political, while relations with European powers were treated as foreign. In 1843, the Governor-General of India, Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough carried out administrative reforms, organizing the Secretariat of the Government into four departments: Foreign, Home, Finance, and Military. Each was headed by a secretary-level officer. The Foreign Department Secretary was entrusted with the \\"conduct of all correspondence belonging to the external and internal diplomatic relations of the government.\\" The Government of India Act 1935 attempted to delineate more clearly functions of the foreign and political wings of the Foreign Department, it was soon realized that it was administratively imperative to completely bifurcate the department. Consequently, the External Affairs Department was set up separately under the direct charge of the Governor-General. The idea of establishing a separate diplomatic service to handle the external activities of the Government of India originated from a note dated 30 September 1944, recorded by Lieutenant- General T. J. Hutton, the Secretary of the Planning and Development Department. When this note was referred to the Department of External Affairs for comments, Olaf Caroe, the Foreign Secretary, recorded his comments in an exhaustive note detailing the scope, composition and functions of the proposed service. Caroe pointed out that as India emerged as autonomous, it was imperative to build up a system of representation abroad that would be in complete harmony with the objectives of the future government. On 9 October 1946, the Indian government established the Indian Foreign Service for India's diplomatic, consular and commercial representation overseas. With independence, there was a near-complete transition of the Foreign and Political Department into what then became the new Ministry of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations. Indian Foreign Service Day is celebrated on 9 October every year since 2011 to commemorate the day the Indian Cabinet created the Foreign Service.  Selection  An Indian Diplomatic Passport and an Official Passport. As opposed to the deep blue passport issued to ordinary Indian citizens, the diplomatic passport is alt= Officers of the Indian Foreign Service are recruited by the Government of India on the recommendation of the Union Public Service Commission. In 1948, the first group of Indian Foreign Service officers recruited under the combined Civil Services Examination administered by the Union Public Service Commission joined the service.http://upsc.gov.in/exams/notifications/2014/csp/CSP%202014%20English.pdf This exam is still used to select new foreign service officers.https://www.mea.gov.in/indian-foreign-service.htm Previous to 1948, some were appointed directly by the then Prime Minister and included former native rulers of India who had integrated their provinces into India apart from known persons like Mohammed Yunus. Fresh recruits to the Indian Foreign Service are trained at Sushma Swaraj Foreign Service Institute after a brief foundation course at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie. In recent years, the intake into the Indian Foreign Service has averaged between 25-30 persons annually. Training On acceptance to the Foreign Service, new entrants undergo significant training, which is considered to be one of the most challenging and longest service trainings in the Government of India and nearly takes more than 1 year to graduate from. The entrants undergo a probationary period (and are referred to as Officer Trainees). Training begins at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie, where members of many elite Indian civil services are trained. After completing a 15-week training at the LBSNAA, the probationers join the Sushma Swaraj Foreign Service Institute, India in New Delhi for a more intensive training in a host of subjects important to diplomacy, including international relations theory, military diplomacy, trade, India's foreign policy, history, international law, diplomatic practice, hospitality, protocol and administration. They also go on attachments with different government bodies and defence (Army, Navy, Air Force, CAPF) establishments and undertake tours both in India and abroad. The entire training programme lasts for a period of 12 months. Upon the completion of the training programme at the Institute, the officer is assigned a compulsory foreign language (CFL). After a brief period of desk attachment in the Ministry of External Affairs, at the rank of Assistant Secretary, the officer is posted to an Indian diplomatic mission abroad where her/his CFL is the native language. There the officer undergoes language training and is expected to develop proficiency in the CFL and pass an examination before being allowed to continue in the service. Functions Then Indian Ambassador to the United States, Nirupama Rao, in a meeting with then U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, in Washington, D.C., 2012 The Ambassador, High Commissioner, Consul General, Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations and Foreign Secretary are some of the offices held by the members of this service. As a career diplomat, the Foreign Service Officer is required to project India‚Äôs interests, both at home and abroad on a wide variety of issues. These include bilateral political and economic cooperation, trade and investment promotion, cultural interaction, press and media liaison as well as a whole host of multilateral issues. Career and rank structure The hierarchy in foreign service Harsh Vardhan Shringla is the 33rd Foreign Secretary of India and administrative head of the Indian Foreign Service & Foreign Service Board The below rank structure is for Indian Foreign Service officers who directly enter the service. *At an embassy: in ascending order of rank **Third Secretary (entry level) **Second Secretary (promotion upon being confirmed in service) **First Secretary **Counsellor **Minister **Deputy Chief of Mission/Deputy High Commissioner/Deputy Permanent Representative **Ambassador/High Commissioner/Permanent Representative *At the Ministry of External Affairs: in ascending order of rank **Assistant Secretary/Under Secretary **Deputy Secretary **Director **Joint Secretary **Additional Secretary **Secretary **Foreign Secretary of India (India's Top Diplomat, Administrative Head of the Indian Foreign Service & Foreign Service Board) Major concerns and reforms =Under strength= India has one of the most understaffed diplomatic forces of any major country in the world. Based on 2014 calculations there are about 2,700 \\"diplomatic rank\\" officers in overseas missions and at headquarters. A minority of the diplomatic officers are Foreign Service (A) officers, the senior cadre of Indian diplomacy, which is primarily drawn from direct recruitment through the Civil Services Examination. Although sanctioned strength was 912, the actual strength of Group A was 770 officers in 2014. In addition there were in 2014, 252 Grade-I officers of Indian Foreign Service (B) General Cadre who after promotion are inducted into Indian Foreign Service (A). The lower grades of the Indian Foreign Service(B) General Cadre included 635 attaches. The breakdown of other cadres and personnel included 540 secretarial staff, 33 from the Interpreters Cadre, 24 from the Legal and Treaties Cadre, and 310 personnel from other Ministries. Shashi Tharoor, currently the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, has presented 12th report for expanding and building the numbers, quality and capacity of India's diplomats. It has been reported that India's diplomatic corps is increasingly outclassed, outnumbered and out of date. =Declining prestige and quality= Since its inception and especially in the early decades of the service, the Indian Foreign Service had a reputation for attracting the country's most talented civil service aspirants. The quality of candidates based on exam rank has significantly declined and the quality of candidates has created concerns about harm to prestige in expanding the size of the service. In the 1960s and 1970s, exam toppers generally in the top 20 opted for the Indian Foreign Service over the Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service, the other elite civil services. By late 1980s, the dip was appreciable and Indian Foreign Service spots did not fill until reaching much deeper down the list. The Indian Foreign Service continues in recent years to have difficulty in attracting the most promising candidates. For the 2017 Civil Services Exam, only 5 of the top 100 candidates chose the Indian Foreign Service with the last ranking person from the General Category in the 152th position. For candidates with reservation status, a candidate from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the 640th position closed the list for Indian Foreign Service. The Indian Foreign Service has become less attractive due to higher pay in corporate jobs, other elite civil services like the All India Services promising more power, and fading glamour as foreign travel became common place. A parliamentary committee reviewing Indian Foreign Service reform in 2016 feared a negative feedback loop with the \\"deterioration\\" in candidate quality as both a \\"both a symptom and a reason for the erosion of prestige in the Indian Foreign Service\\". However, the committee was hard pressed to address the issue because it was also concerned about increasing the \\"quantity\\" of Indian diplomats. T.P. Sreenivasan, a retired Foreign Service officer, argued in 2015 that \\"elitism should be preserved\\" for the Indian Foreign Service to perform effectively. He further lamented the Indian Foreign Service \\"is already a shadow of its former self\\" which dissuaded aspirants and the service needed to have its \\"attractiveness enhanced\\". =Maid abuse and sexual violence= Several incidents involving maid abuse including alleged sexual abuse by Indian Foreign Service officers have caused disruption for bilateral relations with the countries where incidents occur. The heavy handed treatment by US authorities in arresting and strip searchingIndian Foreign Service officer Devyani Khobragade stirred up outrage within India about the country's global image and shined the international spotlight on the treatment of maids by Indian diplomats. New York Consulate-General The arrest of Devyani Khobragade was one of three main incidents between 2010-2013 associated with Indian diplomats living in the United States. The Ministry of External Affairs made a proposal in 2013 to the Ministry of Finance to grant maids the status of government employees but the initiative was found too expensive. A maid for Prabhu Dayal, then the Consul-General in New York, escaped from the Upper East Side consular residence in January 2010. In 2011, the maid Santosh Bhardwaj filed a lawsuit with the representation of the Legal Aid Society against Prabhu Dayal, his wife Chandini Dayal and daughter Akansha Dayal in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleged she worked long hours 7 days a week against the terms of her work contract. She recounted running away with the assistance of the consular security guard and a family she met through the security guard after an \\"inappropriate sexual advance\\" by Prahbu Dayal asking from her a leg massage. The case was settled by Dayal in 2012 for an undisclosed sum. Another New York-based case involved Neena Malhotra who was press counselor at the Consulate General in New York from 2006 to 2009. Malhotra and her husband Joseph Malhotra were sued in 2010 for slavery in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by their former maid. The lawsuit alleged the family took away the passport of the maid and threatened her with beating and rape if she traveled alone. The court awarded a judgment of US$$1,458,335 against the Malhotras. A year after the judgment, Malhotra denied a visa for a US diplomatic spouse on the basis of homosexuality. As of 2016, the judgment remains unpaid. Devyani Khobragade The most notable diplomatic incident of maid mistreatment embroiled Devyani Khobragade, the then Deputy Consul General of the Consulate General of India in New York City. She was arrested in December 2013 by US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and charged with visa fraud for failing to pay a minimum wage for Sangeeta Richard, who traveled from India to serve as Khobragade's maid. While in custody Khobrgaade was subjected to \\"the indignities of repeated handcuffing, stripping, and cavity searches\\". Khobragade was declared by the US government to be persona non grata after her indictment in January 2014 and refusal of the Indian government to waive immunity. Her treatment caused outrage in India and led to a diplomatic row between India and the United States. The support received by Khobragade in India was wide ranging. Prime Miniser Manmohan Singh criticised the actions of the US authorities as \\"deplorable\\". The Delhi Police removed security barricades on the road outside the US Embassy in New Delhi, citing need for improvement of traffic flow in that area. The Indian government ordered the expulsion of US diplomat Wayne May in January 2014 because he had assisted Richard's family in securing T-visas and traveling to the United States. Amrit Lugun The case of Lalita Oraon in 1999, a servant-girl in the household of Amrit Lugun, then first secretary at the Indian embassy in Paris, prompted outcry in French media and cast a shadow on bilateral relations. Oraon was from a Scheduled Tribe in Bihar and by her account an orphan given to Lugun's family at the age of eight. She fled Lugun's residence and was taken into custody by the French police after wandering the streets of Paris. Oraon alleged she was beaten, threatened, and sexually abused by her employer. Police put her in the care of Committee Against Modern Slavery, an anti-slavery NGO, at a convent where she attempted suicide by jumping from a high wall. Oroan was examined by medical staff at H√¥pital Cochin in Paris. According to a doctor speaking to Le Monde, Oraon had suffered \\"knife wounds, three to 6cm deep, all around the vagina\\" and described the injuries as \\"consistent with an act of torture or deliberate mutilation\\". The Indian Ambassador in Paris at the time Kanwal Sibal strongly supported Lugun and prevented a full fledged enquiry into the matter by the MEA. In a statement, the Indian Embassy accused the anti-slavery group of \\"indecent lies\\" against Lugun and claimed Oraon had suffered cuts to her genitals while jumping off the wall to escape from the convent. Jawid Laiq writing for Outlook commented that the case was not only an example of deplorable behavior by a diplomat towards a fellow Indian but represented larger problems in an Foreign Service with a \\"caste (and racist) hierarchy\\". According to Laiq, Foreign Service officers from low caste backgrounds were rarely ambassadors in \\"coveted embassies in the white, Western countries\\" but were rather sent to hardship spots. As of 2020, Lugun is Indian Ambassador to Greece. =Spying= A number of diplomats have been sent home to India from foreign postings on the suspicion of spying. One officer has been convicted under the Official Secrets Act. Madhuri Gupta, an Indian Foreign Service (B) officer, was arrested in 2010 and convicted in 2018 for spying for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence. Gupta served as a Second Secretary in Islamabad where she became involved in a relationship with a man believed to be a Pakistani agent and passed classified information to him. She was sentenced to three years in prison after her conviction in 2018. Outlook speculated that as a single woman in her 50s, she was vulnerable to recruitment or could have been motivated due to job disgruntlement. A reason according to the Indian Express for her dissatisfaction with the Ministry of External Affairs was she \\"felt discriminated against being a Group B Foreign Service officer\\". = Discrimination against Indian Foreign Service (B) = Indian Foreign Service (B) is the subordinate cadre below the Indian Foreign Service (A). The Indian Foreign Service (B) officers are seen as less prestigious by Indian Foreign Service (A) officers. Those who directly enter the Indian Foreign Service (A) have passed the competitive Civil Services Examination while Indian Foreign Service (B) officers were selected by a less competitive entrance exam and can later be inducted into Indian Foreign Service (A) through promotion. The relationship between A and B cadres is marked by territorial grievance and rivalry. A former Indian ambassador, Satyabrata Pal, noted tensions and discrimination between cadres have become worse in the 2010s compared to previous decades. At the level of Grade-I,Indian Foreign Service (B) officers can be inducted intoIndian Foreign Service (A) on promotion. The appointment of promotee Indian Foreign Service (B) officers is antedated 8 years before the date of their induction to Indian Foreign Service (A). Antedating puts the promotee officers ahead of the line for postings in front of directly recruited Indian Foreign Service (A) officers who had entered the service earlier. This practice is a common grievance among Indian Foreign Service (A) officers and has caused conflict. In 2013, 6 Indian Foreign Service (A) officers lodged a complaint against their foreign secretary and eight Indian Foreign Service (B) officers with the Central Administrative Tribunal for clogging the promotion pipeline and leading to \\"de-motivation and demoralisation among direct recruit officers\\". Indian Foreign Service (B) officers complain of discrimination against them by Indian Foreign Service (A) officers. A Facebook group voicing objections of Indian Foreign Service (B) officers sprung up in 2016 when Indian Foreign Service (B) officer Tajinder Singh, Second Secretary in the Indian embassy in Lisbon died of an apparent suicide. The Facebook group, Indian Foreign Service B-Z, alleged Singh was forced to give up his choice assignment in Washington DC, after serving in a hardship posting in Damascus, for the posting instead in Lisbon. After the setback the group claimed Singh committed suicide due to despair from \\"discrimination and professional challenges from Indian Foreign Service (A) officers in the ministry\\". =Discrimination against stenographers= Indian Foreign Service (B) General Cadre have an acrimonious rivalry with theIndian Foreign Service (B) Stenographers Cadre. While Indian Foreign Service (B) General Cadre is considered lower in prestige than the Indian Foreign Service (A), its officers consider the stenographers to be \\"even lower in the order\\". The Indian Foreign Service (B) has two sub-cadres, the Indian Foreign Service (B) General Cadre and Stenographers Cadre through separate entrance exams conducted by the Staff Selection Commission. The Stenographers Cadre provides secretarial support, while the Indian Foreign Service (B) General Cadre provides clerical support by manning the sections and handling the files. In 2009, the path to promotion to Indian Foreign Service (A) was closed for the Stenographers Cadre. The rule change was enacted after pressure by the General Cadre, which remains eligible for induction into Indian Foreign Service (A). The rivalry was brought to the fore when a stenographer was appointed as Indian Ambassador to North Korea in 2012. No Indian Foreign Service officer had wanted the posting in \\"godforsaken\\" Pyongyang. Indian Foreign Service(B) officers vociferously protested the appointment due to the perceived \\"threat to its purported priority in ambassadorial postings\\" and fears of additional claimants in the future to a \\"small piece of cake\\". Three different associations representing Indian Foreign Service (B) officers complained to the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office and the external affairs minister, demanding the appointment be cancelled and calling it a \\"national shame to appoint a stenographer as the envoy to such a strategic country\\". A senior official in the Ministry of External Affairs speaking to The Telegraph rejected the complaint and compared it to a \\"caste system that the Indian Foreign Service (B) is trying to impose\\".

Hayter (1901-1942), who was killed in action, while serving aboard the cruiser during the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November 1942. Lieutenant Commander Hayter was serving as damage control officer when New Orleans received a torpedo hit, and as Central Station, his battle post, filled with asphyxiating gas he ordered all men without masks to leave the compartment giving his own to a partially stricken seaman. After clearing the compartment of all personnel, Lt. Cmdr. Hayter was finally overcome by the fumes. For this extraordinary act of heroism he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. Hayter was launched by Charleston Navy Yard, con 11 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Maurine K. Hayter, widow of the namesake; and commissioned at Charleston on 16 March 1944, Lieutenant Commander H. H. Theriault in command. Service history Hayter departed Charleston on 1 April 1944 for shakedown training off Bermuda, and subsequently was assigned to an escort division for Atlantic duty. Between 1 June and 30 November 1944, she made three voyages to Europe, two from Norfolk, Virginia to Bizerte and one from Casco, Maine, to Bizerte. During the voyages Hayter provided anti-submarine protection and transferred the division doctor to many merchant ships in the convoy needing medical assistance. Hayter sailed on 2 January 1945 on a special duty in the Atlantic, with other units of Escort Division 62. Their assignment to find and sink , which had been sending vital weather reports to Axis units from the Azores area. The ships conducted several search sweeps before Hayter made contact with the submarine on 16 January, and after a series of lethal depth charge attacks lasting two hours the submarine was sunk. Hayter patrolled the Azores for a time, then joined a convoy screen for the voyage back to Norfolk, arriving on 5 February 1945. Departing Casco Bay on 17 March, Hayter and her escorts proceeded into the north Atlantic for anti-submarine sweeps in the Iceland area. The ships made a depth charge attack on 10 April, but did not score a definite kill. The group returned to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, on 14 April, and departed four days later for anti-submarine barrier patrol, cruising between escort carriers to the south, and , to the north. Contact was made on 23 April and all ships searched without avail until the next day, when escort reported contact on her starboard bow. As Hayter maneuvered to attack, Frederick C. Davis was struck by a torpedo on her port side amidships, breaking her in two. As the stricken ship settled and sank, Hayter began rescue operations, and despite rough seas, sharks, and the threat of further attacks, managed to save 65 survivors and recover 12 of the dead from the sea. Three of the survivors were revived by artificial respiration given by members of Hayters crew. In the meantime, the other escorts had closed in on the submarine, , and forced it to the surface. Guns quickly sank the U-boat and her captain was later made prisoner. Hayter arrived Argentia on 6 May and sailed two days later for Philadelphia Navy Yard via Boston. She arrived on 22 May and began her conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport, her designation becoming APD-80 on 1 June 1945. Emerging as a high speed transport, Hayter departed Philadelphia on 13 August 1945 for her refresher training off Guantanamo Bay. She subsequently operated out of Norfolk and Newport in training operations until 30 October, when she departed Norfolk for Jacksonville, Florida. Decommissioning and sale At Jacksonville, Hayter was placed in the Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida, decommissioned on 19 March 1946 and was later moved to the Texas group, where she remained until struck on 1 December 1966. Transferred to South Korea on 23 July 1967, the ex-Hayter was commissioned into the South Korean Navy in August of that year as gunboat ROKS Jonnam (PG-86) (also spelled Jon Nam). Reclassified as escort transport APD-86 in 1972, Jonnam was purchased outright by South Korea on 15 November 1974, redesignated APD-827 in 1980, and again to DE-827 in 1982. She was stricken in 1986.

Farrell was a three-time winner of The Sporting News' Minor League Manager of the Year award (1954, 1956 and 1961) and, as of 2015, he's the only man to have won that award more than twice. Playing career Born in Leapwood, an unincorporated community of McNairy County, Tennessee, Farrell played college baseball at Freed-Hardeman College for two years. In his playing days (1932‚Äì52), he was a first baseman and veteran minor-leaguer who appeared in two full MLB seasons during the World War II manpower shortage, with the 1943 Boston Braves and the 1945 Chicago White Sox, batting .262 with 177 hits, no home runs and 55 runs batted in in 188 games played. He also pitched in five games for the 1943 Braves, losing his only decision and compiling an earned run average of 4.30 in 23 innings of work. He batted and threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Managing career Farrell began his managing career before the war in the Class C Middle Atlantic League in 1941‚Äì42. In 1947, he became a skipper in the farm system of the Cleveland Indians with the Spartanburg Peaches of the Class B Tri-State League and began a steady rise through the Cleveland organization. His 1953 Reading Indians of the Class A Eastern League won 101 games, while his 1954 and 1956 Indianapolis Indians, then Cleveland's Triple-A club, won American Association pennants and the 1956 Junior World Series. These triumphs earned Farrell his first two managerial awards. At the close of the 1956 season, when his Indians won 88 games and finished as runners-up to the New York Yankees, Cleveland manager Al L√≥pez resigned to become the new skipper of the White Sox and Farrell was promoted to succeed him. The 1957 campaign was a star-crossed season for the Indians. Prodigal left-handed pitcher Herb Score, a strikeout king and 20-game winner in 1956, was nearly blinded on May 7 by a line drive off the bat of the Yankees' Gil McDougald, and missed the rest of the campaign. Two other 20-game winners from '56, eventual Hall of Famers Bob Lemon and Early Wynn, slumped to below .500 records. The Indians fell to a 76‚Äì77 (.497) record and a sixth- place finish, the team changed general managers (from Hank Greenberg to Frank Lane), and Farrell was fired. The year was marked by the MLB debut of Roger Maris, who played for Farrell with Indianapolis,Roger Maris: Baseball's Reluctant Hero, p.85, Tom Clavin and Danny Peary, Touchstone Books, Published by Simon & Schuster, New York, 2010, He then returned to the minors, where he managed in the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets and Minnesota Twins organizations. He also coached for the White Sox (1966‚Äì69) and Indians (1970‚Äì71). As a minor league skipper over 21 seasons, Farrell won 1,710 games, losing 1,456 (.540).

Typically, \\"Economics Major and Minor\\", University of Pittsburgh Economics Major, Stanford University Bachelor of Economics - Degree Structure, University of Adelaide the core-degree comprises microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics; while mathematical economics is sometimes required.BCom with specialisation in Economics, University of the Free State Micro- and macroeconomics are taught through the \\"intermediate\\" level, preparing the student for the \\"advanced\\" postgraduate courses. Macroeconomics extends to a discussion of the more advanced models of the economy, differences here between schools, and the related policy analysis; microeconomics to general equilibrium, and game theory as applied to competition. Some programs then specify a course in microfoundations, where the macroeconomic models are derived by aggregating microeconomic models. Econometrics is intended to give empirical content to these economic relationships, and here focuses on the single-equation methods largely linear regression, and time series. Building on this core, are courses in the major branches of economics: monetary economics, international economics, development economics, labor economics, and welfare economics. Social science oriented degrees may emphasize economic statistics and political economy; and often do not require econometrics or mathematical economics. History of economic thought and economic history may be included in either variant. Electives may be offered in the above branches, or in various areas of applied economics, such as agricultural economics, environmental economics, resource economics, managerial economics, and financial economics. Mathematical economics is often an elective; it is generally recommended for those intending graduate training in Economics. In the US, these students will often also study selected math-courses in multivariable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, optimization, and sometimes analysis.Courses and Requirements: Economics, Hamilton College Co-requisite courses from outside of economics are invariably a program requirement. Common to all business programs are introductory or business statistics, and \\"quantitative techniques\\" (comprising basic calculus, interest calculations, and sometimes matrix operations); the social science programs often include these, and may also require sociology and psychology. Some knowledge of accountancy or management may be assumed in the \\"applied courses\\"; credits in these are usually inherent in the business degree. Most specialized programs require further \\"Mathematics for Economists\\", which includes a review of the topics mentioned above; See for example these sequences. UQ: i, ii, iii; UCT: i, ii, iii. The final in both cases is at masters level and includes analysis. see Business mathematics #Undergraduate. Statistics is similarly extended,BA Economics, SOAS often within the math course, as underpin to the econometrics coursework. The specialized BSc programs are often more math intensive than the BA programs.What can you do with an economics degree?, Times Higher Education Similarly, the Honors track will have additional math requirements.

The degree is also offered as an MS or MSc in economics, MA in economics, a Master in Economic Sciences (MEconSc), a MCom in economics, or as a Master of Applied Economics. Structure The degree may be offered as a terminal degree or as additional preparation for doctoral study, and is sometimes offered as a professional degree, such as the emerging degree, MPS in Applied Economics. The program emphases and curricula will differ correspondingly. The course of study for the master's degree lasts from one to two years. A thesis is often required, particularly for terminal degrees. Many universities (in the United States) do not offer the master's degree directly; rather, the degree is routinely awarded as a master's degree \\"en route\\", after completion of a designated phase of the PhD program in economics. Typically, the curriculum is structured around core topics, with any optional coursework complementary to the program focus. The core modules are usually in microeconomic theory, macroeconomic theory and econometrics. At this level, the topics covered are microfoundations and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, and allow for heterogeneity, relaxing the idea of a representative agent. Sometimes, topics from heterodox economics are introduced. Econometrics extends the undergraduate domain to multiple linear regression and multivariate time series, and introduces simultaneous equation methods and generalized linear models. Game theory and computational economics are often included. Some (doctoral) programs include core work in economic history. See Economics education #Curriculum. Theory-focused degrees will tend to cover these core topics more mathematically, and emphasize econometric theory as opposed to econometric techniques and software; these will also require a separate course in mathematical economics. Note though that regardless of focus, most programs \\"now place a marked emphasis on the primacy of mathematics\\", and many universities thus also require \\"quantitative techniques\\", See for example these sequences. UQ: i, ii, iii; UCT: i, ii, iii. The final in both cases is at masters level and includes analysis. especially where mathematical economics is not a core course. The optional or additional coursework will depend on the program's emphasis. In theory-focused degrees, and those preparing students for doctoral work, this coursework is often in these same core topics, but in greater depth. In terminal or applied or career-focused degrees, options may include public finance, labour-, financial-, development-, industrial-, health- or agricultural economics. These degrees may also allow for a specialization in one of these areas, and may be named correspondingly (for example Master's in Financial Economics, Masters in International Economics, Masters in Development Economics, Master's in Sustainable Economic Development and Masters in Agricultural Economics.) Entry requirements are undergraduate work in (calculus-based) economics, at least at the \\"intermediate\\" level, and often as a major, and a sufficient level of mathematical training (including courses in probability and statistics; often (multivariable) calculus and linear algebra; and sometimes mathematical analysis.)

The combination of a favorable climate, warm sea, mountainous scenery, fine beaches along more than a thousand kilometers of shoreline along the Aegean and Mediterranean waters, and abundant natural and archaeological points of interest makes this stretch of Turkey's coastline a popular national and international tourist destination. Among the archaeological points of interest are two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: The ruins of the Mausoleum of Maussollos in Halicarnassus; and the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus. The Turkish Riviera is also the home of the internationally known Blue Voyage (a.k.a. Carian Cruise), which allows participants to take a week-long trip aboard the local gulet schooners to ancient cities, harbors, tombs, mausolea, and beaches in the small coves, forests, and streams that are on the Turquoise Coast. The coastline is regarded as a cultural trove that provides background on a fascinating mixture of factual and mythological individuals, conflicts and events, and has frequently been referred to in the folklore of various cultures throughout history. As such, it is regarded as the home of scholars, saints, warriors, kings, and heroes, as well as the site of numerous well- known myths. Mark Antony of the Roman Empire is said to have picked the Turkish Riviera as the most beautiful wedding gift for his beloved Cleopatra of Egypt.The Mediterranean Region of Turkey ; archived copy at web.archive.org.

Ambos Nogales (Spanish: \\"both Nogaleses\\") refers to the two cities of Nogales, Arizona, United States, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. They lie 60 miles directly south of Tucson, Arizona, divided by the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier. Though divided by the border between their respective nation states, the two municipalities have historically shared a sense of community alluded to in their description as \\"Ambos Nogales,\\" as well as other sayings and phrases alluding to this camaraderie. The motto of Nogales, Sonora, is Juntos por amor a Nogales, meaning \\"United by the love of Nogales\\". Ambos Nogales has become a subject of anthropological and archaeological research due to the ways in which the material presence of the border wall has impacted the lives of those living in these cities. Investigation of community, migration, immigration (both legal and illegal), drug trafficking, gang violence, and all of the activities associated with these has occurred at Ambos Nogales due to its unique identity and geographic position.McGuire, Randall H.: Steel Walls and Picket Fences: Rematerializing the U.S.‚ÄìMexican Border in Ambos Nogales. American Anthropologist, Vol. 115. 2018. Material Changes at the Border The barrier dividing Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora has undergone a handful of material changes from the 19th century up to the present. It was not until 1898 that a material division other than stone cairns and obelisks marked the division between the United States and Mexico, a line of telephone poles were installed along the border cut through Ambos Nogales and guard posts were implemented at the crossing gates between the two settlements.Arreola, Daniel D., and Curtis, James R.: The Mexican Border Cities: Landscape, Anatomy, and Place Personality. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. 1993. Additional material was added to the border by the United States in response to the Mexican Revolution (1911-1918) with the addition of a barbed wire fence. The next addition, also by the United States, was a six- foot-high chain link fence including electric lights and new gatehouses on both the United States and Mexican sides of the border.Arreola, Daniel D.:The Fence and Gates of Ambos Nogales: A Postcard Landscape Exploration In On the Border: Society and Culture between the United States and Mexico.

Edward Michael Rowell was born in the Victorian goldfields, at Vaughan, on 15 June 1876. He married Rachel Johnston (1891-1970), at Footscray, Victoria on 4 March 1908.Marriages: Rowell‚ÄîJohnston, The Age, (Saturday, 28 March 1908), p.5. Early life As a teenager in the 1890s Rowell was attracted to the goldfields in Western Australia and as a youngster was proficient in cricket, foot running and Australian rules football. Playing in the Kalgoorlie-based Goldfields Football League for five years, Rowell booted over 250 goals, which earned him representation in Perth in the first Australian rules goldfield representative side in 1896. Football Rowell made his VFL debut with the Collingwood Football Club during the 1901 VFL season (at 24 years of age), and he played 189 games for 175 goals.Rowell is one of the three Collingwood footballers (the others were Charlie Pannam and Dick Condon) responsible for the development of the stab-kick; see \\"'The Stab Kick' ‚Äî A Football Development\\", The Argus, (Monday 27 June 1910), p.6. He was not an overly tall player at 178 cm and weighing 80 kg but his great advantage was his speed (which had also been useful in his career as a professional runner). Rowell scored 31 goals in the 1901 season and 33 goals in 1902, playing as a key position forward. Rowell played in the 1903 Collingwood premiership side before moving back to Western Australia in 1904, however this was only a one-off and he attempted a return to Collingwood in 1905, but for the League not allowing a permit for him to play. He sat out the 1905 season but returned in 1906. In 1907 Rowell was switched to defence where he became one of the first truly attacking full- backs. Prior to this full-backs did not create run out of defence and acted more like a goalkeeper. He remained a full-back until 1914. Trademarks of his play would be to \\"tap the ball to himself and run along the wing\\" as well as his placekicking, which travelled 60 yards. In 1907 and 1908 Rowell was the acting playing-coach of Collingwood. He added to his 1903 success as a player with another premiership in 1910. In 1914 Rowell retired but made a surprise return in the 1915 VFL Grand Final where he was among the best players in a loss for the Magpies. During a 1912 match for Collingwood against Essendon Football Club, Rowell was involved in an unusual incident when he got his foot stuck in a drain pipe on the ground while running for the ball against his opponent. While Rowell struggled to free himself, his opponent casually picked up the ball and easily goaled.Atkinson, p. 166. A year earlier, in a match against Richmond, Rowell was attacked by a small dog during play.Atkinson, p. 167. =Representative= Rowell played 7 games for Victoria for 7 goals. Athlete Rowell was also a noted athlete who once raced world record holder Jack Donaldson over 100 yards at halftime of a Collingwood match Rowell played in. Rowell narrowly lost, having just played 50 minutes of football.Atkinson, p. 178. Retirement He later wrote a series of sporting articles.

Since 1967, two single-lane tunnels have connected Nor√∞depil with the regional city of Klaksv√≠k. Immediately bordering Nor√∞depil to its north is the abandoned settlement of Foss√°, of which nothing remains. Foss√° was named after some waterfalls. Further north on the east coast of Bor√∞oy there is a road going from Nor√∞depil to the abandoned hamlet of M√∫li. = Whaling station = In 1897 the whaling station Norddeble was constructed by Andorsen & Neumann, but whaling activity didn't start until 1898.Savn.fo, Hvalast√∏√∞ir √≠ F√∏royum 1894-1984 Among the first owners was Peder Michelsen, who had been an accomplished gunner on the boat Urd, with Gr√∏n at Gj√°noyri. And for the first time we see the company Chr. Salvesen & Co. in the Faroes, the company which later started up the station Vi√∞ √Åir. The station started with one boat, Norddeble. The well-known Faroese Sverri Patursson went on one trip with Norddeble in 1899. The station was only active for part of the first season of 1898, but 54 whales were harpooned, which gave 1316 barrels of whale oil. In 1899 the station processed about 60 whales, of these were 26 blue whales, and got around 1700 barrels. For the first four years, the station only had the boat Norddeble. In August 1902 the station bought a second boat. 1906 was a bad year for all whaling stations, and only Norddeble managed to produce more than 2000 barrels. 1907 was better and the station produced 2600 barrels, the good weather that season had a lot to say for the end result. Michelsen was lost at sea 28 December 1910 in Antarctica, and the company stopped whaling activities at Nor√∞depli in 1912. The station was sold to A/S Suder√∏, who attempted whaling in the season 1920, but it failed completely, and the station closed down.

He participated in five expeditions to Antarctica during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, for which he was awarded the Polar Medal with four bars, one of only two men to be so honoured, the other being Ernest Joyce. Early life Frank Wild was born in Skelton- in-Cleveland, North Riding of Yorkshire, the eldest of eight sons and three daughters born to Benjamin Wild, a schoolteacher, and his wife Mary (n√©e Cook), a seamstress. The family came from Skelton close to Marton, birthplace of Captain James Cook, to whom the family claimed ancestry through Mrs. Wild; her father was Robert Cook, who claimed to be a grandson of the great explorer. By 1875, the Wild family had moved from Skelton to Stickford in Lincolnshire, and in late 1880 moved again to Wheldrake near York. Wild's family next moved to the village of Eversholt in Bedfordshire. Here his father was appointed clerk of the Eversholt Parochial Charity at Woburn. Frank Wild was educated at Bedford. He joined the Merchant Navy in 1889 at the age of 16, receiving his early training in sail in the clipper ship Sobraon. In the Merchant Navy he rose to the rank of second officer. In 1900, aged 26, he joined the Royal Navy. The 1901 census shows that at that time, aged 27, he was serving as an able seaman on , anchored in Sheerness Harbour. Antarctic exploration Frank Wild (left side) beside Shackleton Wild took part in the following Antarctic expeditions: * In 1901, he was a member of Robert Falcon Scott's crew as an able seaman on the Discovery, along with Ernest Shackleton, who was then a sub-lieutenant. * In 1908‚Äì1909, he was a member of Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition and was a member of the team that crossed the Ross Barrier and Beardmore Glacier at a record latitude of 88¬∫23'S. * In 1911, he joined Douglas Mawson's Aurora expedition and was in charge of the western base on the Shackleton Ice Shelf. * From 1914 to 1916, he served as Shackleton's second-in-command on the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. * In 1921‚Äì1922, he served as second-in-command of the Shackleton‚ÄìRowett Expedition. As second- in-command of Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Wild was left in charge of 21 men on desolate Elephant Island as Shackleton and a crew of five undertook an epic open-ocean voyage to South Georgia aboard the lifeboat James Caird in order to seek rescue. For more than four months, from 24 April to 30 August 1916, during the Antarctic winter, Wild and his crew waited on Elephant Island, surviving on a diet of seal, penguin and seaweed. They were finally rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship Yelcho. Point Wild on Elephant Island is named after Frank Wild; a monument dedicated to the Chilean captain Luis Pardo, who rescued him and his men, now stands at the site. On returning to the United Kingdom in 1916, Wild volunteered for duty during World War I and was made a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After taking a Russian language course, Wild became the Royal Navy's transport officer at Archangel, where he superintended the war materials which arrived during the Allied intervention in Russia. After the war, Wild went to South Africa, where he farmed in British Nyasaland with Francis Bickerton and James McIlroy, two former Antarctic comrades. From 1921 to 1922, Wild was second-in-command of the Shackleton‚ÄìRowett Expedition, a poorly equipped expedition with no clear plan, and a small ship, the Quest. Shackleton died of a heart attack on South Georgia during the expedition, and Wild took over command and completed the journey, combating unfavourable weather to Elephant Island and along the Antarctic coast. Wild's younger brother Ernest Wild also went on to become a Royal Naval seaman and Antarctic explorer, receiving a Polar Medal. Later years On 24 October 1922, Wild married Vera Alexandra Altman (n√©e Bogosoff), the widow of a tea planter of Borneo, at Reading Registry Office. They had first met in 1918 when Wild was serving in Russia, and he had assisted her to obtain a passage home to England. After the Shackleton‚ÄìRowett Expedition, Wild returned to South Africa with Vera where he continued to farm. He bought some land in the Mkuzi valley in Zululand where he tried to grow cotton. The enterprise was a financial disaster and after five years of drought followed by flood, Wild gave up. Next he was involved in railway construction and for a time had some success with a contract to extend the South African railway to the border with Swaziland. However, the contract ended and he was forced to seek employment elsewhere. Wild's marriage to Vera was in difficulty shortly after arriving in Zululand and she asked for a divorce, which became absolute on 27 December 1928. Next, Wild took a temporary job as a hotel barman at Gollel in Swaziland which was owned by a friend of his. Caught in the 1930 Depression, he was forced to move from job to job, including working as a battery manager at a diamond mine which went bankrupt, prospecting in Rhodesia and managing a quarry. He subsidised his meagre income by giving the occasional lecture on the Endurance expedition. He married for the second time on 18 March 1931. His new wife, Beatrice (Trixie) Lydia Rhys Rowbotham, was 47 years old and ten years his junior. They settled in Germiston, where in 1932 he worked supervising a stone-crushing machine at a Witwatersrand gold mine. Very happily married, the following four years saw relative peace and calm and Wild earned enough money not only to buy a car (a Wolseley) but to take two well needed holidays in the hinterland and coast of South Africa. Due to ill health, he was forced to leave the mining job and he was given a job by his brother-in-law Pat O'Brien Frost to oversee the building of Frost's house in Haenertsburg in the Eastern Transvaal. However, he had little respect for Frost; that and the demands of building the house in an extremely remote part of the country caused him to return to Johannesburg. By now he was in poor health but retained his characteristic kind, calm countenance. With the offer of a job as a storekeeper on the Babrosco Mine near Klerksdorp from his friend Jack Scott, the mining magnate, he and Trixie finally found the peace they were seeking. He had also been awarded the Civil List pension from Downing Street. Wild died of pneumonia and diabetes in Klerksdorp on 19 August 1939, aged 66 years. He was cremated on 23 August 1939 at the Braamfontein Cemetery in Johannesburg. Honours and memorials Wild was awarded the CBE in the New Year Honours List of 1920 and in May 1923 he was made a Freeman of the City of London. He was also the recipient of a number of awards for his contributions to exploration and for advancing geography: He received the Royal Geographical Society's Back Award in 1916 and the Society's Patron's Medal in 1924. Cape Wild and Point Wild on Elephant Island in the Antarctic are named after him, as is Mount Wild in the Queen Alexandra Range and Mount Wild in Graham Land. His CBE and four-bar Polar Medal sold for ¬£132,000 in September 2009, more than double the estimate. On 27 November 2011, the ashes of Frank Wild, Shackleton's \\"right-hand man\\", were interred on the right-hand side of Shackleton's grave site in Grytviken, South Georgia; the ashes had previously been found in the vault of Braamfontein Cemetery, Johannesburg, by journalist and author Angie Butler while researching a book. The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads \\"Frank Wild 1873‚Äì1939, Shackleton's right-hand man.\\" Wild's relatives and Shackleton's granddaughter, the Hon. Alexandra Shackleton, attended a service conducted by the Rev Dr Richard Hines, rector of the Falkland Islands. Butler said, \\"His ashes will now be where they were always supposed to be. It just took them a long time getting there.\\" The journey to South Georgia, the service and the interment were the subject of a BBC Radio 4 programme in the Crossing Continents series. On 25 November 2011, the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands issued a set of commemorative postage stamps honouring Frank Wild along with other Antarctic pioneers. The set comprises eight stamps in four se-tenant pairs with denominations of 60, 70 and 90 pence, and ¬£1.15. They are available from the Falkland Islands Philatelic Bureau. In April 2012, BBC2 broadcast \\"Frank Wild: Antarctica's Forgotten Hero\\", presented by Paul Rose, which placed Wild's achievements alongside those of Shackleton and the other explorers of the Heroic Age. The documentary film also featured commentary from polar historian Dr. Huw Lewis-Jones, author Francis Spufford and explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Of Wild, Paul Rose has said: \\"He was a true great. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Shackleton. They made the perfect team. With Shackleton‚Äôs great leadership skills, and Frank‚Äôs cool head and experience, they were able to handle almost anything that the Antarctic could throw at them.\\" On 29 September 2016, a statue of Wild was unveiled in his hometown of Skelton-in- Cleveland.

Biography Born in Hampstead, Surrey, on 29 May 1879, he was educated at Monkton Combe School, Bath and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, before qualifying as a surgeon from St Bartholomew's Hospital. Marshall met Shackleton in 1906 at a house party in London. Shackleton told him about the proposed expedition to the South Pole and suggested Marshall go on a training course on surveying and then he could become the expedition's surgeon, surveyor and cartographer as well as the principal photographer.Polar Friction: the relationship between Marshall and Shackleton by Leif Mills, 2012 According to Leif Mills, who has written about the two men in Polar Friction: the relationship between Marshall and Shackleton, 2012, Marshall was \\"an indispensable member of Shackleton's expedition; yet on the voyage down from New Zealand to Antarctica, during the long Antarctic winter at their base at Cape Royds and on the actual southern journey, Marshall constantly criticised Shackleton in his diary, sometimes in almost vitriolic language, and seemed to have nothing but contempt for him.\\" Marshall maintained his criticism of Shackleton throughout his life, referring to him as 'the biggest mountebank of the century' in one letter held at the Royal Geographical Society dated 30 August 1956. Marshall joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in April 1915. He was mentioned in despatches by Sir Douglas Haig, Commander in Chief of the British Armies in France and Flanders in April 1916 for service at Ypres and for service at the Somme in May 1917. He was awarded the Military Cross in January 1918. By the end of the First World War he had attained the rank of acting major. In autumn 1918, Marshall was posted to Archangel in northern Russia as a member of the British North Russian Expeditionary Force, serving as a senior medical officer at Archangel. For his services there he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire and awarded the Russian Order of St Stanislaus.Damien Wright.

He participated in the Nimrod expedition, the first expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the South Pole. Biography Born in Rippingale, Lincolnshire, the son of a doctor and the grandson of a captain in the Indian Navy, he ran away from school to enter the merchant navy at the age of 13. In 1902 he became a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, and on reaching the rank of Lieutenant he was one of the last to gain a Master Mariner's certificate under sail. But he gave up a promising career to join Ernest Shackleton as the second-in-command of the Nimrod Expedition. Despite the expedition's ultimate failure, he was one of the party of four who reached the Polar Plateau for the first time ever, thus showing the way to the Pole. On 9 January 1909 they attained a Furthest South of , just from the South Pole, when they were forced by impending starvation to turn back. On his return from the Antarctic in 1909, he entered the Civil Service, where a year later he was appointed head of the North-Eastern Division of the Employment Exchanges. Recalled to the Navy on the outbreak of the First World War, he became Flag Lieutenant to Admiral Hood commanding the Dover Patrol. Then, after a period of special work at the Ministry of Munitions, he was posted to Flanders to command a battery of naval siege guns. A bad wound in the head necessitated his return in 1917, and he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Croix de Guerre for his services. After the war, he returned to the Ministry of Labour as Controller for the North-Eastern Division, and such spare time as he had was largely devoted to helping boys' clubs. In 1928 was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He left the service in 1935 to become Secretary of King George's Jubilee Trust for youth. He remained in this post, apart from further distinguished service in the Second World War, until his retirement in 1948, when he was knighted in the Royal Victorian Order. He never actually stopped working; he then became the honorary appeals secretary for King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers, where he worked right up to his death in 1962. Character and legacy In appropriate company, his use of somewhat crude invective was often unrestrained, and he was never deterred by convention from saying what he thought. He preferred to be known by allcomers, from porters to the royal family, simply as \\"The Mate\\". In November 2008, 100 years after the Nimrod Expedition began, one of \\"The Mate's\\" great grandsons, Henry Adams, set off from the Shackleton Hut with two other members of the Shackleton Centenary Expedition to complete the whole to the South Pole on foot, hauling their own supplies, unassisted. In January 2009, another of \\"The Mate's\\" great grandsons, David Cornell, joined the Expedition at the Farthest South to complete the last of unfinished family business.

Kim Il-Sung and his successor Kim Jong-Il were both cinephiles and sought to produce propaganda films based on the Juche ideology. All film production is supervised by the Workers' Party of Korea and generally concerns propaganda. North Korea has nevertheless produced some non-propaganda films for export to the wider world. Film studios North Korea's principal producer of feature films is the Korean Film Studio, a state-run studio founded in 1947 and located outside of Pyongyang. Other North Korean film studios include the Korean Documentary Film Studio (founded in 1946), the April 25 Film Studio of the Korean People's Army (founded in 1959 and previously known as the February 8 Cinema Studio) and the Korean Science and Educational Film Studio (founded in 1953 and also known as the April 26 Children's Film Production House, and Science Educational Korea, or SEK.)Sch√∂nherr 2007, p. 145. These studios produce feature films, documentaries, animated films, children's films and science films. According to a report from 1992, the Korean Feature Film Studio produced about forty films per year, while the other studios together accounted for another forty. In addition to its domestic animated productions, SEK has produced animation for foreign companies. Production costs in North Korea are very low, and the quality of animators is well perceived. SEK has done work on such productions as Mondo TV's animated series Pocahontas Pocahontas and King Lion SimbaKing Lion Simba and the films Light Years and Empress Chung. North Korean leader Kim Il-sung believed in Lenin's maxim: \\"Cinema is the most important of all arts.\\" Accordingly, since the country's division, North Korean films have often been used as vehicles for instilling government ideology into the people. A common theme is martyrdom for the nation. The film Fate of a Self-defence Corps Member, based on a novel written by Kim Il-sung during the fight against the Japanese occupation reflects this theme, as does the highly regarded film, Sea of Blood (1969). The latter film comes from a novel telling the story of a woman farmer who becomes a national heroine by fighting the Japanese. Another favorite theme is the happiness of the current society. This theme can be seen reflected in titles of feature films like A Family of Workers, A Flowering Village, Rolling Mill Workers, When Apples Are Picked and Girls at a Port. All of these films were awarded the People's Prize before 1974. Production estimates The number of films produced in North Korea is difficult to determine. In 1992, Asiaweek reported that the country produced about 80 films annually, and a BBC report in 2001 indicated that North Korea was then producing about 60 films a year. In spite of these claims, Johannes Sch√∂nherr, an attendee of the 2000 Pyongyang International Film Festival, found little evidence for actual films or titles. He notes that the country offered only one domestic feature and one documentary at their most high-profile film festival, and suggests that the high number of reported films includes short films, cartoons, and short installments of long-running series. He also cites a 1998 North Korean pamphlet containing a list of films which had been made in the country up to 1998. This gives a total of 259 titles, and indicates that the 1980s were the most prolific decade with about 15 to 20 films made yearly.Sch√∂nherr 2007, pp. 141‚Äì143. The British Film Institute Sight & Sound magazine reported that an average of 20 films per year were made from the 1960s to the early 1990s. However, in the economic hard times following the collapse of the Soviet Union film production reduced, and from 2000 to 2009 only about 5 films per year were made. Film festivals The Pyongyang International Film Festival, established in 1987 and broadened in scope in 2002, is now held every two years. History =1940s and 1950s= After the division of Korea following the defeat of the Japanese Empire in WWII, filmmakers in the North and the South sought to produce the first Korean film after the liberation in their respective half of the peninsula. Although South Koreans were first, with Viva Freedom! (1946), North Korea soon followed with My Home Village. Because of the secretive nature of the country as well as the lack of film exports, the exact number of feature films produced in North Korea is almost impossible to determine. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) lists only 165 films produced in North Korea; some of which include foreign co- productions.https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Countries/NorthKorea Two of these were released in the years between the liberation from Japan and the outbreak of the Korean War, Our Construction (Uri Geonseol) (1946) and My Homeland () (1949). Five were released during the war, including Righteous War (1950), Boy Partisans (1951) and Again to the Front (1952). These titles suggest that film was used for ideological purposes from the beginning of North Korea's existence as a separate entity. Nearly all studios and film archives were destroyed during the Korean War, and after 1953 studios had to be rebuilt. =1960s and 1970s= A Spinner (1964) and Boidchi annun dchonson (1965) were made in the 1960s. One of the most highly regarded films in North Korea, Sea of Blood, was produced in 1969. The entrance hall to the Korean Feature Film Studio contains a mural of \\"Dear Leader\\" Kim Jong-il supervising the production of this film. This is a two-part, black and white film. The first part is 125 minutes in duration, and the second is 126 minutes. Kim Il-sung made a famous call for Juche art in 1966, saying, \\"Our art should develop in a revolutionary way, reflecting the Socialist content with the national form\\". In a 1973 treatise on film entitled Theory of Cinematic Art, Kim Jong-il further developed this idea of Juche art into the cinema, claiming that it is cinema's duty to help develop the people into \\"true communists\\", and as a means \\"to completely eradicate capitalist elements\\". The ideology-heavy nature of North Korean cinema during the 1970s can be seen in titles such as The People Sing of the Fatherly Leader and The Rays of Juche Spread All Over the World. Part of this ideological usage of the arts was a treating of the same subjects repeatedly through various art forms. Consequently, the most prominent films of the era took their stories and titles from pre-existing novels, ballets or operas. The film Sea of Blood was also an opera and a symphony, as well as the name of an opera company. Future Minister of Culture, Choe Ik-kyu's The Flower Girl (1972, 130 min.) later was remade as a dance. This film won a special prize and special medal at the 18th International Film Festival, and is one of the more well-known North Korean films of the 1970s. Unsung Heroes, a 20-part spy film about the Korean War, was released between 1978 and 1981; it achieved notice outside of North Korea two decades later mainly because United States Forces Korea defector Charles Robert Jenkins played a role as a villain and the husband of one of the main characters. =1980s and 1990s= With 14 listings, the 1980s is the best-represented decade for North Korea at IMDB. A possible turning to less didactic subjects is indicated with a 1986 production of the popular stories like Chunhyang-jon (1980 - 155 min.) and Hong kil dong () (1986 - 115 min.). Probably the most well-known North Korean film internationally is the giant-monster epic, Pulgasari () (1985), directed by kidnapped South Korean director Shin Sang-ok. Multi-part films promoting the Juche ideology, including Star of Korea and The Sun of the Nation were also produced in the 1980s. North Korean animation produced for domestic consumption is reportedly less politically dogmatic during this period, resulting in a large adult audience. At least one international co-production has been filmed in North Korea, Ten Zan - Ultimate Mission, directed by Italian director Ferdinando Baldi and starring American Frank Zagarino. Norodom Sihanouk, a filmmaker and former King of Cambodia, was among Kim Il-sung's good friends, allowing him to make up to four films in North Korea beginning with The Mysterious City in 1988, using the country's actors and facilities while in exile away from Cambodia. IMDB lists only four North Korean films made in the 1990s. Nation and Destiny () is a 56-part series of movies produced from 1992‚Äì1999, on Korean subjects and people like General Choi Duk Shin (parts 1-4) and composer Yun I-sang (parts 5, 14-16). = 2000 and Present = The 2000s appear to be reasonably productive for North Korean cinema, having five listings so far. In a sign of thawing relations, the animated film, Empress Chung (2005), is a co-production of South and North Korea. This film is said to be the first released simultaneously in both countries. Another recent North/South co-production is the 3-D animated television series Lazy Cat Dinga.

He was the son of Addison Emery Verrill, the first professor of zoology at Yale University. He authored many books on natural history and science fiction works. Biography Hyatt Verrill was born at New Haven, Connecticut. He wrote on a wide variety of topics, including natural history, travel, radio and whaling. He participated in a number of archaeological expeditions to the West Indies, South, and Central America. He travelled extensively throughout the West Indies, and all of the Americas, North, Central and South. Theodore Roosevelt stated: \\"It was my friend Verrill here, who really put the West Indies on the map.‚Äù During 1896, he served as natural history editor of Webster's International Dictionary, and he illustrated many of his own writings as well.

He exists in Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. Masquerading as a superhero, his original costume and characterization are strongly imitative of the character Spawn as seen in Image Comics. Publication history Nightwatch's alter ego, Dr. Kevin Barry Trench, first appeared in 1993, in Web of Spider- Man #97. Trench took on the \\"Nightwatch\\" / \\"Nighteater\\" identity two issues later, in Web of Spider-Man #99. Most of his appearances came in the 1990s in various titles starring Spider-Man and in his own short-lived, self-titled series. One of his more prominent roles was in the Maximum Carnage crossover, a fourteen-part miniseries that ran in the Spider-Man titles in 1993. The character returned in a 2014-2015 storyline in She-Hulk. Fictional character biography Doctor Kevin Trench, upon witnessing a costumed man seemingly die battling some terrorists armed with invisibility-generating 'cloaking\\" devices, unmasked the body afterward to learn that it was an older version of himself. Freaking out, Trench stripped the costume from \\"his\\" body and fled to a deserted island, reasoning that if he just never wore the suit or went home, he wouldn't die.Web of Spider-Man #100 (May 1993) Events conspired to bring him back, as the criminal Alfredo stole one of the costume gloves after washing up on the island and being nursed to health by Trench.Web of Spider- Man #98-99 (March‚ÄìApril 1993) After Alfredo had been dealt with, Trench decided that he couldn't avoid his destiny, and decided to investigate the costume's origins. In the following years, Trench became the supervillain known as \\"Nighteater\\". Eventually wishing to become a lower-level superhero for selfish reasons, being realized villains never \\"win\\" and that \\"heroes\\" are ensured respect, money, power, and a comfortable and safe retirement, Trench hired Doctor Druid, The Shocker, and Vibro to aid him in casting a powerful spell that effectively \\"retconned\\" all memories and all existing documented history into believing that \\"Nightwatch\\" had worked for years in the superhero community. The spell consumed the lives of the hundreds of residents of the North Dakota town in which it was cast. It was so successful, however, that when it was complete, the four heroes (She-Hulk, Tigra, Monica Rambeau, and Wyatt Wingfoot) who had been trying to save the town immediately joined \\"Nightwatch\\" in bringing Druid, Shocker, and Vibro to justice.She-Hulk #12 (February 2015) In the interim, Trench then battled menaces like the \\"Maximum Carnage\\" gang, who were wreaking havoc across New York and slaughtering dozens of innocent civilians. He had many allies in the fight, including, but not limited to, Captain America, Black Cat, Deathlok and Firestar.Web of Spider- Man #103 (August 1993) He also fought the mutated Deathmask. Graduating into his own book, Nightwatch encountered similar \\"cloaked\\" villains, and was shocked when their technology merged with and enhanced his costume.Nightwatch #1 (April 1994) In between battling menaces like Flashpoint, Cardiac (whose technology had been stolen to create the more vicious Cardiaxe), and Venom, Nightwatch discovered that an old ex-girlfriend was working for the shady Morelle Pharmaceuticals on a nanotech project. Ultimately, project head Phillip Morelle proved to be recklessly conducting nanotech experiments to make a replacement skin for his dying son Justin. Nightwatch fought his way onto Phillip Morelle's space station to confront him but not before Phillip sends two assassins into the past to kill Nightwatch using his nanotechnology to open a time portal. Much to both Nightwatch and Phillips surprise that same time technology allows a future version of Justin Morelle to travel into the present. Future Justin, armed with a more advanced version of Nightwatch's own suit, kills his father and reveals that the nanotechnology his father was developing produced a dangerously unstable energy matrix that in his timeline devastated North America killing billions. Justin upgraded Nightwatch's armor to its final evolution and the two of them worked together to destroy the space station before the disaster could happen.Nightwatch #2-11 (May 1994 - February 1995) In the present-day epilogue, Justin Morelle, the son of Phillip and Trench's ex, received the nanotech skin from the project as his father had dreamed. Seeing his ex happy with her healed son, Nightwatch seemingly chose to travel into the past and complete the time loop with Cardiac's help, ensuring his own death but also ensuring the cataclysm timeline would never come to pass ensuring this happy ending would be the true timeline. The series seemingly ends with Kevin's trip into the past while the future Justin's fate remains unclear.Nightwatch #12 (March 1995) Sometime later, still in the present, Nightwatch is shot in the chest by El Toro Negro,Spider-Man Unlimited #14 (December 1996) and uses the last of his costume's power to go back in time to warn his past self. In the past, he is distracted by a fight with terrorists and seemingly dies before he can warn himself. =She-Hulk Vol. 3= \\"Nightwatch\\"/\\"Nighteater\\" reappears in the 2014-2015 run of She-Hulk. In the story, Kevin Trench reappears in street clothes at the newly established law practice of Jennifer Walters, a.k.a. the She-Hulk, regarding a legal case referred to only as \\"the blue file\\", involving several costumed superhumans, including Walters and Trench, which an unrevealed agency seems determined to keep unresolved. Trench is revealed to have survived his original previously established \\"death\\", that his original younger self had merely mistaken him for dead and stripped his body, and working in the past, he is stated as having previously and continuing to currently \\"keeping....an extremely low profile\\", using the Nightwatch nanotech sparingly while maintaining a medical practice and doing charity work until he had returned chronologically to the present, significantly older and wealthy. He aids Walters in beating back a sudden assault from grotesque creatures, donning the Nightwatch helmet and manifesting tentacles from the inner surface of his trench coat. A few days later, he calls Walters and informs her that he has spread word of her fledgling law practice to other \\"guys from back in the day--people like me who took what they could from the [superhero] game and moved on\\", bringing an influx of new potential clients to Walters' office.She-Hulk #6 (July 2014) However, it is later discovered that Trench himself is behind the attempts to keep Walters from further investigating the \\"blue file\\": legal papers regarding a lawsuit filed in a North Dakota county court which names She-Hulk and a small group of heroes and villains as defendants.She-Hulk #7 (August 2014). The suit is a mystery to all involved, as none have any recollection of the plaintiff or having participated in any event in North Dakota. Furthermore, there are no records of any kind or any memories of anyone in the superhero or local community, nor any record of the town in which the actionable event was supposed to have taken place had ever existed.She-Hulk #11 (January 2015). It is ultimately revealed that a lone survivor of the North Dakota town, aware of \\"Nightwatch\\" having previously been \\"Nighteater\\" and of his sacrificing the town, having survived due to having been previously carried outside of the town limits by She-Hulk, who had promised them to bring Nighteater to justice, and who afterward had failed to convince the law enforcement or local hero communities that anything had happened whatsoever, had later filed the civil suit against Trench and the other heroes and villains present, leaving behind a single document that She-Hulk's paralegal was able to locate. She was able to use this document (and her own unexplained mystic powers) to break She-Hulk and her team of their convictions in Nighteater's false history, and that he has later arranged for the lone survivor to be killed. \\"Nightwatch\\"/\\"Nighteater\\" was then brought to justice. Powers and abilities Nightwatch's costume boosted his strength and durability by triggering his adrenal glands, and nanotechnologically repaired itself. His cape responded to his subconscious thoughts to move on its own to attack his foes as well as allowing him to glide on air. After he was boosted by the later-generation Morelle technology, the durability of the costume increased, the cape became more metallic, and he had something closer to true flight in addition to increased speed and eventually nanotech cutting blades. These qualities were later also applied to his trenchcoat. In other media =Film= * A Nightwatch film was claimed to be in development for Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.

Baker (born 28 July 1952) is an Australian journalist, commentator, author, and broadcaster well known in Australia for his vast knowledge of Rock music. He has written books and magazine articles on rock music and travel, interviewed celebrities, managed bands such as Ol' 55 and promoted tours of international stars. In the mid-1980s, Baker took the BBC's \\"Rock Brain of the Universe\\" crown three times. Baker was the Australian editor of Billboard for over 20 years. He won the inaugural Australian Travel Writer of the Year award in 1995 from the Australian Society of Travel Writers, and he won the award again in 2000. Biography Glenn A. Baker was born in 1952, the eldest of four children to Joyce Baker and grew up in Coogee until he was nine; when the Bakers relocated to Canberra. His younger brother, Johnny, drowned in an accident in the following year and his parents separated not long after. He moved about NSW, attending 12 schools in 10 years. While working for the Department of the Media, where he worked on the research project that led to the establishment of 2JJ, Baker met Geoff Plummer, who was a drummer for a 1950s retro band, Fanis. Baker saw them perform in 1975 and became their manager, changing their name to Ol' 55 after the Tom Waits song. Baker's management was astute and presented the group as a combination of retro kitsch, rock music and clever theatrics. Baker introduced chartered accountant Peter Brian to the band, and he became their versatile front man Frankie J. Holden; in October, Baker recruited saxophone player Nick Aitken, who performed as Wilbur Wilde. Ol' 55 had hit singles with On the Prowl, Looking for an Echo and the number one (I Want A) Rockin' Christmas (which Baker co- wrote, as he did C'mon Let's Do It) and a No. 2 triple platinum debut album, Take It Greasy. Both Holden and Wilde had careers in television after Ol' 55. During 1976‚Äì1978 Baker also managed Punkz, which he moulded into the pop group Cheek, who had national chart success with So Much in Love.

It counts over 1,000 public and private corporations and other organizations as members, encompassing 60 countries. The Conference Board convenes conferences and peer- learning groups, conducts economic and business management research, and publishes several widely tracked economic indicators. History The organization was founded in 1916 as the National Industrial Conference Board (NICB). At the time, tensions between labor and management in the United States were seen as potentially explosive in the wake of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911 and the Ludlow Massacre in 1914. In 1915 presidents of twelve major corporations in the United States and six leading industry associations met in Yama, New York to formulate the business community‚Äôs response to continued labor unrest and growing public criticism.Tranger, James. The New York Chronology: The Ultimate Compendium of Events, People and Anecdotes from the Dutch to the Present. . p. 356 After additional crisis meetings, the National Industrial Conference Board was officially founded May 5, 1916, at the Hotel Gramatan in Bronxville, New York. Although many of the organizations‚Äô founders‚Äîincluding former AT&T; president Frederick P. Fish and General Electric executive Magnus W. Alexander, its first president‚Äîhad supported the open-shop movement, by 1916 they regarded national unions such as the American Federation of Labor as permanent fixtures of the American economy, and urged negotiation and concord.‚ÄúHistory.‚Äù National Industrial Conference Board Records. Hagley Museum and Library. http://www.hagley.org/library/collections/manuscripts/findingaids/acc1057nic.htm#99bio When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the National War Labor Board formed by President Woodrow Wilson asked the NICB to formulate plans that would keep war industries running and strife-free. Its recommendations‚Äîbased on cooperation between representatives of employers, employees, and government‚Äîwere adopted in full. During and after the war, the NCIB conducted pioneering research into workers' compensation laws and the eight-hour workday, and established the U.S. Cost of Living Index. Though often mistrusted in its early years as an ‚Äúemployers union‚Äù funding studies against the labor movement,Laue, J. Charles. ‚ÄúLabor and Capital to Battle over Unionsm‚Äù. New York Times.

By the 1930s, however, it had already lost most of its character as an industry lobby. Virgil Jordan, a writer and economist who replaced Alexander as president on the latter‚Äôs death in 1932, established a Bureau of Economic Audit and Control to offer members and the public an independent source of studies on unemployment, pensions, healthcare, and related issues in the midst of the Great Depression, when many questioned the credibility of the government‚Äôs economic statistics. Unions soon joined the NICB alongside corporations for access to its research, conferences, and executive network. The organization is now considered an unbiased ‚Äútrusted source for statistics and trends, second only to perhaps the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äù.Kleiman, Carol. ‚ÄúConference Board: A Trusted Resource.‚Äù Chicago Tribune. March 8, 1987. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-03-08/news/8701180829_1_conference- board-labor-economist-fabian-linden After World War II, The Conference Board‚Äîthe shortened name adopted in 1970‚Äîexpanded to non-U.S. members for the first time. Today, it has offices in Brussels, Beijing, Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The Conference Board of Canada was spun off as an independent non- profit in 1981. In 1996, the US Department of Commerce selected The Conference Board to produce and distribute the US leading economic indicator series. This was the first time a US Government agency entrusts a major economic series to a private organization. Today, The Conference Board produces indicators for the US, Euro Area and eleven other countries. The composite economic indexes are designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. In 2002, after an epidemic of business scandals, The Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise is convened. Composed of a blue-ribbon panel of respected leaders from both the private and the public sectors, many of the Commission's recommendations were voluntarily adopted by leading companies and continue as best practices in corporate governance. In 2006, The Conference Board established its China Center for Economic and Business in Beijing as a resource for senior executives with a significant strategic interest in China's fast-evolving economy through events, publications, indicators, and peer-group CEO Council sessions. In 2008, The Conference Board likewise opened its first Indian office, in Mumbai. In 2007, The Conference Board took over publication of the Total Economy Database and two years later began release an annual Global Economic Outlook series that now encompasses annual growth projections for over 65 economies. The Conference Board assumed control of the International Labor Comparisons (ILC) program, formerly a division of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2013 due to across-the-board federal spending cuts. ILC produces internationally comparative datasets on labor conditions, productivity, income, and more using the same concepts and methodology as those previously used by BLS. In January 2015, the Committee for Economic Development (CED) merged with The Conference Board as its US public-policy center headquartered in Washington, DC. The Conference Board celebrated 100 years of operation in 2016, followed by CED's 75th anniversary on 2017. In 2018, The Conference Board expanded its global footprint further by launching the Gulf Center for Economics and Business Research, based in Kuwait. In 2020, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, The Conference Board launched a dedicated online hub and resource center for helping businesses navigate its unprecedented economic, human capital, ESG, public policy and communications challenges.  Membership and professional development  The Conference Board's membership network encompasses the majority of the Fortune 500. Each year, nearly 2,500 senior executives participate in The Conference Board Councils‚Äîsmall peer-learning groups that bring together professionals to exchange ideas, discuss challenges, and advance their fields in intimate, confidential meetings held around the world. These range from networks organized for particular C-suite titles‚Äîincluding multiple councils for chief financial officers, chief human resources officers, chief information officers, chief legal officers, and corporate treasurers‚Äîto those focused on narrower areas of expertise or specific business challenges, from business continuity and responsible sourcing to advancing women in leadership and social media. The councils align with the focus areas of the organization's five centers. The Conference Board hosts more than 50 public conferences each year across Europe, Asia, and North America. These include some of the longest standing annual events dedicated to employee healthcare, succession management, diversity, women's leadership, and leadership development. In addition to live events, The Conference Board produces dozens of interactive webcasts and public podcasts each month featuring influential executives, thought leaders, and emerging trends alongside its own team of researchers. The Conference Board's professional development programming is recognized by a number of independent accreditation organizations, which award continuing education credits to qualifying participants of its conferences, councils, webcasts, and virtual events. These include the HR Certification Institute, the Society For Human Resource Management, the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, the International Association of Privacy Professionals, the International Coaching Federation, the Compliance Certification Board, and continuing legal education bodies.  Focus Areas and Regional Centers  The Conference Board produces original research, convenes conferences, and organizes executive peer-learning councils through topical Centers based in business hubs around the globe. In the United States, it currently operates five Centers from New York City and Washington, DC: * Economy, Strategy & Finance - including global economy, innovation and digital transformation, labor markets, consumer dynamics * Marketing & Communications - corporate communications, consumer dynamics, marketing * Environmental, Social & Governance - corporate governance, sustainability, corporate citizenship and philanthropy * Human Capital - leadership, learning and development, talent acquisition, employee engagement and experience, diversity and inclusion, HR technology, human capital analytics, labor markets, coaching and mentoring * Committee for Economic Development (Public Policy) - regulation, healthcare policy, education, infrastructure, tax reform, fiscal health, immigration In Europe, The Conference Board also hosts five Centers from is regional headquarters in Brussels: * Corporate Governance * Economy, Strategy & Finance * Human Capital * Marketing & Communications * Sustainability In the Asia- Pacific region, the organization currently features three Centers: * Economy, Strategy & Finance * Human Capital * Sustainability Additionally, The Conference Board operates a dedicated China Center in Beijing, and was one of the first US business think tanks to establish an on-the-ground presence to understanding the rapid transformation of the Chinese economy. Founded in 2018 and based in Kuwait City, The Conference Board Gulf Center likewise serves the business community across the Gulf region. Economic Indicators The Conference Board publishes a number of regular indicators for United States and international economies that are widely tracked by investors and policy makers. They include: * U.S. Consumer Confidence Index ‚Äì Begun by The Conference Board in 1967, this monthly survey of 5,000 households is widely established as the leading measure of American consumer confidence.‚ÄúConsumer Confidence: An Online NewsHour Special Report.‚Äù The Newshour with Jim Lehrer. PBS. May 2001. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/economy/jan- june01/confidence_5-29.html Results from the household survey are tabulated to provide a barometer of the U.S. economy (currently indexed to the year 1985 = 100). * Global Consumer Confidence Index ‚Äì In 2019, The Conference Board expanded its consumer-data footprint worldwide, with a new quarterly index encompassing 68 global economies * CEO Confidence Survey ‚Äì The quarterly Measure of CEO Confidence gauges the outlook of chief executives in their own industries and the economy as a whole. * Leading Economic Indexes ‚Äì In the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Commerce began researching and releasing business cycle indicators, which use composite data points (including manufacturing, construction, and stock market indicators) to time economic expansions, recessions, and recoveries. In December 1995, The Conference Board took over the business indicator program from the government and continues to publish leading, coincident, and lagging indexes for the U.S. economy each month. The program was also expanded to other economies; beyond the U.S., The Conference Board currently publishes leading, coincident, and trailing indexes for the Australia, Brazil, China, the Euro Area, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and the U.K. * Employment Trends Index ‚Äì Created in 2008, the Employment Trends Index aggregates eight separate indicators and ‚Äúoffers a short-term, forward look at employment [that] gives economists and investors a new forecasting tool. It also helps business executives sharpen their short- to medium-term hiring and compensation planning.‚Äù *Help Wanted OnLine ‚Äì The Help Wanted OnLine program uses crawler technology to survey job openings posted on approximately 1,000 online job boards. The monthly data series compares labor supply (job vacancies) against demand (unemployed workers) to determine the tightness of the job market for individual metro areas and occupation categories. The online program is the successor of the Help Wanted Advertising Index, which surveyed print newspaper ads. The organization also releases regular global and regional growth outlooks and commentaries on economic news. Notable research The Conference Board's research reports and experts are often featured in a wide range of global business media‚Äîfrom specialist trade publications to the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Bloomberg News, Forbes and Fortune. Notable examples include: * C-Suite Challenge ‚Äì A recurring survey of the most pressing challenges and responses facing CEOs and other top executives across industries and regions. * Annual benchmarking reports and data dashboards that reveal emerging trends in areas including CEO succession, executive compensation, corporate board practices, and shareholder voting. * Annual survey on US salary increase budgets across industries and seniority. * Annual job satisfaction survey of U.S. workers. * Annual survey on corporate communications practices and trends. * The economic impact of the child care industry. * The management and leadership preferences of millennials. * Policy solutions for making capitalism more sustainable.

J. Josey (January 20, 1924 ‚Äì July 3, 2009) was an African-American activist and librarian. Josey was born Elonnie Junius Josey in Norfolk, Virginia to Willie and Frances Bailey Josey.Roger M. Valade III, The Essential Black Literature Guide, Visible Ink, in association with the Schomburg Center, 1996; p. 204. He graduated from Howard University in 1949 and received his master's in History from Columbia University in 1950 and a master's in librarianship from the University at Albany, SUNY in 1953 being the second African American to do so.Goedeken 1998, p. 192 Immediately after graduating, Josey accepted a position at the Free Library of Philadelphia.To Be Black and a Librarian: Talking with E. J. Josey. (2000). American Libraries, 31(1), 80. From 1955 to 1959, he was Director of the Library of Delaware State College, Dover, Delaware, and from 1959‚Äì1966, he was Chief Librarian and Associate Professor at Savannah State College in Savannah, Georgia. He also served on the staff of the Columbia University Library, the New York Public Library, and prior to his position at Delaware State College, he served as Instructor of Social Sciences and History from 1954‚Äì1955 at Savannah State College. In 1966, Josey joined the New York State Education Department in its Division of Library Development as an Associate in the Bureau of Academic and Research Libraries . In 1968 he was promoted to Chief of the Bureau of Academic and Research Libraries and held that position until 1976 when he was appointed Chief, Bureau of Specialist Library Services, New York State Library. Josey was also Professor Emeritus, Department of Library and Information Science, School of Library and Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh. Memberships Active in the field of human rights, he was a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and served as President of Albany, New York Branch from 1982‚Äì86. He also served as President of the Albany Branch of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History. Active in community affairs, he also served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Albany County Opportunity, Inc., the local anti-poverty agency for four years. A member of the American Library Association for 48 years (Since attended his first conference in 1957To Be Black and a Librarian: Talking with E. J. Josey. (2000). American Libraries, 31(1), 80.), at the 1964 annual conference, he authored the resolution forbidding Association officers and staff from participating in state associations that deny membership to black librarians. This action led to the integration of the library association of several Southern states, and he became the first black librarian to be accepted as a member of the Georgia Library Association. In The Black Librarian in America (1970) Josey recalled the 1964 annual conference: > Much to my chagrin, the Mississippi Library Association was honored there > for its National Library Week Activities. I exploded! I was seething with > anger, for I remembered that three civil rights workers-Andrew Goodman, > James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner had been murdered and lay dead and > buried somewhere in Mississippi, their bodies not yet discovered. I also > remembered that the Mississippi Library Association had withdrawn from ALA > rather than give membership to Negro Librarians. He was first elected to the ALA Council, the policy making body of the Association in 1970 and served until the summer of 2000, a period of 29 years. In 1979, he was elected to a four-year term on the ALA Executive Board. From 1980‚Äì82, he served as Chair of the Cultural Minorities Task Force of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. Having served on numerous ALA Committees, he chaired the ALA Committee on Pay Equity, the ALA Committee on Legislation, and the ALA International Relations Committee several times. Josey was the President of ALA in 1984‚Äì85. At his inaugural address in 1984, Josey made this forward-thinking comment still applicable to libraries today: \\"The information industry has the technology to control information, but its price tag on information distribution and its profit goal create a bias in what information is made available and how it is dispensed. Only the nonprofit organization, the library, dedicated to a total community service goal with trained experts, librarians, running the operation can provide the full scope of information for the total population in a fair and objective manner.\\" In the spring of 1987, he was elected to a 4-year term on the Board of Directors of the Freedom to Read Foundation and chaired the ALA International Relations Committee from 1987 to 1990. From 1990 to 1994 he served as the Chair of the ALA Legislation Committee. He returned to chair the ALA International Relations Committee for the next two years. In May and June, 1987, Professor Josey lectured in three African countries, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia under the auspices of the United States Information Agency. Civil Rights activities During the early 1960s, he participated in the Civil Rights struggle in Savannah (see The Black Librarian in America, pp. 308‚Äì11). He served on the Executive Board of the Savannah Branch of the NAACP as well as the Executive Board of the Albany, NY Branch of the NAACP. In 1964 he carried the Civil Rights struggle into the American Library Association. In spite of the 1954 United States Supreme Court decision, which encouraged desegregation of libraries and ALA chapters, the ALA was slow in implementing integration of all of its southern chapters until Josey offered his resolution at the 1964 Conference which prevented ALA officers and staff members from attending segregated state chapter meetings. The four remaining segregated chapters that denied membership to African-American librarians at that time were Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi; and they integrated immediately. He is well known for his uncompromising opposition to any form of discrimination whether it is racial, gender, age or sexual orientation. Awards * Josey was recipient of many awards. The American Library Association History Round Table presented him with its Journal of Library History Award for research on Edward Christopher Williams, the first African American to graduate from library school in 1900. * Under his leadership, the Savannah State University Library received the 1962 and 1964 John Cotton Dana Award. * In 1967, he returned to Savannah State University to be honored with the Savannah State University Award. * In 1980, he received the American Library Association's most coveted award, the Joseph W. Lippincott Award. The citation of the award read in part: > His fervent advocacy was a major factor in eradicating racial discrimination > from many library facilities and services, and from a number of professional > associations. As founder of the Black Caucus in ALA, and as its leader > throughout the group's formative years, he gave a new strength, unity, > purpose and hope to many minority members of our profession. * He has received a number of awards from the NAACP. In 1965, he received the NAACP National Office Award for Work with Youth. In 1966, he received the Georgia NAACP Conference Award.

They are one of the main algae responsible for causing the phenomenon of watermelon snow (also blood snow, raspberry snowhttps://www.yourweather.co.uk/news/science/blood-snow-invades-an- antarctic-island-world-weather-news-global-latest-science-environment- antarctica.html), where patches of snow appear red or pink. The first account of microbial communities that form red snow was made by Aristotle. Researchers have been active in studying this organism for over 100 years. Although C. nivalis is closely related to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the environmental conditions each species inhabits are very different. C. nivalis can be found in mountains, snowfields, and polar regions around the world. The habitat of C. nivalis subjects the cells to environmental extremes including limited nutrients, low temperatures, and intense sunlight. In comparison with the mesophilic C. reinhardtii, C. nivalis has special mechanisms that allow it to be cryotolerant and survive on rock surfaces as well as in soil, meltwater, and snow. Secondary carotenoids, a thick cell wall, and particles on the cell wall are some characteristics that protect the cyst from light, drought, and radiation stress. Although the seasonal mobile to dormant life cycle of C. nivalis is complex, it also helps the algae exploit its niche and survive unfavourable conditions. As a result, C. nivalis is one of the best known and studied snow algae. When taking account of the photoprotective effect of its secondary carotenoid, astaxanthin, among the other adaptive mechanisms to its extreme habitat, it can be understood how C. nivalis became so dominant in microbial snow algae communities. Green motile offspring are produced in the spring and throughout the summer. They develop into red dormant cysts, the stage where this organism spends most of its life cycle, as the winter season begins and remain a cyst until the spring. This alga is an interesting organism for researchers in various fields to study due to its possible role in lowering global albedo, ability to survive in extreme environments, and production of commercially relevant compounds. Additionally, its life cycle is still being studied today in an effort to better understand this organism and amend previous classification errors. Etymology The name Chlamydomonas nivalis is of Latin origin. It translates to ‚Äòfound growing in or near snow‚Äô.Guiry, M. D. in Guiry, M.D. & Guiry, G.M. (2018). AlgaeBase. World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway. http://www.algaebase.org; Accessed on: 04 March 2018. The Latin meaning describes the organism well as this species of algae are only found associated with snow or near snowy areas. Description The seasonal life cycle of C. nivalis can be broken down to three stages based on the colour of the cell as a result of carotenoid composition, which are green, orange, and red.L√ºtz, C.

They avoid unfavourable light and temperature by swimming in the snow until they reach more optimal conditions.Remias, D.; L√ºtz-Meindl, U.; L√ºtz C.

European Journal of Phycology. 40 (3): 259-268, doi: 10.1080/09670260500202148 Chloroplasts of green cells are irregularly shaped. The dominating pigment, chlorophyll, gives the cell its characteristic hue and facilitates maximum cell growth through light absorption. Secondary carotenoid concentrations are much lower at this stage as the cells need photosynthetically active radiation for energy and growth. Cells in the green stage also have less organic and inorganic particles on their surface compared to mature cysts. Later in the season, when nitrogen and nutrients becomes limited and radiation stress increases, the green cells will develop into flagellated sexual gametes that mate and produce new zygotes that have lost their flagella and are capable of surviving the winter period. Transformation into the zygote, or hypnoblast, is characterized by the production and accumulation of reserve materials that include sugars and lipids as well as the formation of esterified secondary carotenoids. The secondary carotenoids will turn the green zygotes orange as they accumulate in the extraplastidial area around within the cell to protect themselves from UV radiation. Orange and red spores can be seen throughout the summer. During this stage, the cell wall will also begin to thicken to help the cell tolerate freezing temperatures and UV light.Remias, D.; Albert, A.; L√ºtz, L.

In addition, the color of these pigments reduces albedo such that individual cells may melt nearby ice and snow crystals to access limiting nutrients and water in an otherwise unavailable frozen state.Dial, R.; Ganey, G.; Skiles, M. (2018). ‚ÄúWhat color should glacier algae be? An ecological role for red carbon in the cryosphere‚Äù.

While he recognized that something must be contributing to the odd colouration, red snow was also commonly mistaken as mineral deposits or pollen up until the early 1900s.Clark, F. C. (1875) ‚ÄúRed Snow‚Äù. Am. Nat. 9:129‚Äì135. In 1819, samples of ‚Äòred snow‚Äô were brought back for examination with a returning Arctic expedition under Sir John Ross. The samples were sent to Robert Brown and Francis Bauer for examination. Both men came to different conclusions on how to classify the specimens. Brown believed the specimen to be a unicellular alga while Bauer declared it a new species of fungus, Uredo nivalis.Sutton, E. A. (1970). ‚ÄúThe physiology and life histories of selected cryophytes of the pacific Northwest‚Äù. Ph.D. Thesis. Oregon state university, Corvallis.Wille, N. (1903). ‚ÄúAlgologische Notizen IX-XIV. Nytt‚Äù Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne. 41: 89-185. Over the next century, many researchers disputed over whether these organisms were lichen, plants, alga, or animal. It was not until the early 20th century when researchers finally began to agree on the algal nature of the organism and gave its currently known name, Chlamydomonas nivalis. In 1968 C. nivalis was officially recognized as a collective taxon.Kol, E. (1968). ‚ÄúA note on red snow from New Zealand‚Äù. N. Z. J. Bot. 6 (2): 243-244. doi:10.1080/0028825X.1968.10429063 Unfortunately, due to the lack of sequencing techniques, reliance on visually examining similarly looking snow alga, and complicated life cycle of this species, errors continued to be made in classifying this and other species of snow algae. Today, C. nivalis has become one of the most well-studied snow algae. Although its taxonomy is still being settled, the life cycle of this snow algae is now much better understood.Remias, D.; Pichrtova, M.; Pangratz, M.; L√ºtz, C.; Holzinger, A.

It is the most abundant snow algae and typically composes the majority of cells identified in specimens taken from various sample sites. Most habitats these algae reside in are very different from other species of the rest of the genus Chlamydomonas.M√ºller, T.; Bleiss, W.; Martin, C.-D.; Rogaschewski, S.; Fuhr, G.

The environmental conditions C. nivalis is typically exposed to are considered to be extreme. The cells can experience low nutrient availability, acidity, intense sunlight, radiation, extreme temperature regimes, and darkness.Leya, T.; M√ºller, T.; Ling, H. U.; Fuhr, G. (2004). ‚ÄúSnow algae from north-western Spitsbergen (Svalbard), Ber. Polarforsch. Meeresforsch. 492: 46-54.

Nature Geoscience. 10: 754-759. doi: 10.1038/NGEO3027 C. nivalis spends the majority of its life in the cyst stage surrounded by snow at a depth that can range from .Mosser, J. L.; Mosser, A. G.; Brock. T. D. (1977). ‚ÄúPhotosynthesis in the snow: the alga Chlamydomonas nivalis (Chlorophyceae)‚Äù. J. Phycol. 13 (1): 22-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1529-8817.1977.tb02881.x This can change depending on if the cell is in a mobile stage and can move, the snow melts due to the onset of warm weather, or the onset of precipitation causes more snow to fall on the cells. Cells that are exposed on unshaded snow may be subjected to high levels of visible light and ultraviolet radiation for an extended amount of time. Meanwhile, cells that are deep below the snow‚Äôs surface may experience darkness. In its flagellated stage, the cell can move until it is in the most optimal position in the snow for moisture content, light, and temperature. When in the immotile cyst stage, the C. nivalis cells must depend on the flow of meltwater to move it by chance to a favourable area. The temperatures in which this species can survive in ranges from below 0 ¬∞C to just above 20 ¬∞C. Growth is slow when temperatures are below 5 ¬∞C. At 5-15 ¬∞C the growth of C. nivalis cells can outperform the growth of C. reinhardtii cells. Both species grow at the same rate at 20-25 ¬∞C. The growth of C. nivalis is suppressed when temperatures rise above 30 ¬∞C. It is a true snow alga because it performs better in low temperatures than warm temperatures. Due to C. nivalis‚Äô ability to perform photosynthesis well from cold to moderate temperatures, this species is considered a cryotolerant mesophile rather than a cryophile. This organism is also very resilient as they can also survive in warm soil for weeks. They can also tolerate dryness and room temperature for as long as 6 months. Fungi, worms, bacteria, and viruses have been found to associate with or live in the same environment as C. nivalis. Encapsulated rod-shaped gram- negative bacteria have been found on the surface of C. nivalis cysts. The unknown bacteria were not detected in control samples that did not contain C. nivalis which strongly suggests that it must be associated with the algae.Weiss, R. L. (1983). ‚ÄúFine structure of the snow alga (Chlamydomonas nivalis) and associated bacteria‚Äù. J. Phycol. 19 (2): 200-204. doi: 10.1111/j.0022-3646.1983.00200.x Another bacterium, Mesorhizobium loti, was found as contamination in a C. nivalis culture, but further testing suggested that this bacteria may be synthesizing vitamin B12 for the algae.Kazamia, E.; Czesnick, H.; Nguyen, T. T.; Croft, M. T.; Sherwood, E.; Sasso, S.; Hodson, S. J.; Warren, M. J.; Smith, A. G. (2012). ‚ÄúMutualistic interactions between vitamin B12 ‚Äìdependent algae and heterotrophic bacteria exhibit regulation‚Äù. Environ. Microbiol. 14 (6): 1466-1476. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02733.x. In cryoconite holes C. nivalis can be found among bacteria, virus-like particles, ciliates, and Chlorophyte species. Ice worms have also been found to live preferentially under C. nivalis in glaciers, possibly using the algae as a food source.Shain, D. H.; Mason, T. A.; Farrell, A. H.; Michalewicz, L. A. (2001). ‚ÄúDistribution and behaviour of ice worms (Mesenchytraeus solifugus) in south-central Alaska‚Äù.

As winter approaches, the cells will approach the last stage of their life cycle. The orange cells mature into red cysts, the form in which it will remain for the remainder and longest portion of its life cycle.Williams, W. E.; Gorton, H. L.; Vogelmann, T. C. (2003). ‚ÄúSurface gas-exchange processes of snow algae‚Äù. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 100 (2): 562-566. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0235560100 Cells at this stage are most resistant to harsh environmental conditions. Inorganic and organic materials such as bacteria, fungi, and dust particles coat the mucilage layer of the cell wall. The inorganic impurities were found to be rich in silicon, iron, and aluminum. These elements can also be taken up into the cellular compartment and stored in vacuoles and may be an importance source of mineral supply.L√ºtz-Meindl, U.; L√ºtz, C. (2006). ‚ÄúAnalysis of element accumulation in cell wall attached and intracellular particles of snow algae by EELS and ESI‚Äù. Micron. 37 (5): 452-458. The cell wall, as the boundary that protects the inner contents of the cell from the harsh conditions in its habitat, is very rigid and hard to destroy. It also may play a role in protecting the algal cells from desiccation during the freeze-thaw cycle alternations during seasonal changes. The spherical immotile red cysts range from 35-40 ¬µm in diameter. The cell contains one central chloroplast that has a naked pyrenoid, ribosomes, starch grains, and numerous small grana stacks composed of 3-7 thylakoids within it.Holzinger, A.; Lutz, C. (2006). ‚ÄúAlgae and UV irradiation: Effects on ultrastructure and related metabolic functions‚Äù. Micron 37 (3): 190‚Äì207. doi: 10.1016/j.micron.2005.10.015. Negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol composes the majority of the thylakoid membranes. The thylakoid membrane lipid composition can also be changed to enhance lipid fluidity in response to lower temperatures. An undulated membrane encloses the chloroplast. Lipid bodies and carotenoid globules surround the plastid. A red secondary pigment, astaxanthin and esterified derivatives of it, accumulates up to 20 times the amount of chlorophyll a in the cytoplasmic lipid bodies of mature red spores. Astaxanthin protects the chloroplast from excessive light by absorbing a portion of it before it reaches the photosynthetic apparatus which subsequently prevents photoinhibition and UV damage. The absorbed radiation is converted to heat, aiding in the melt of nearby snow and ice crystals to access needed nutrients and liquid water. Astaxanthin can also act as a metabolic sink for the metabolically active spores that do not divide. Within the cytoplasm there are several small cytoplasmic vacuoles with partially crystallized content within it. While mitochondria are present, they are not very obvious. Most of the cytoplasmic space is taken up by the large plastid, lipid bodies, and carotenoid globules. C. nivalis has one centrally located nucleus that is also oriented such that it is covered by the carotenoid globules full of astaxanthin that will provide protection against UV radiation. The majority (91%) of astaxanthin derivatives are stored in its monoester form within dormant C. nivalis red cysts. Astaxanthin is the pigment that makes the cell appear deep red. Other pigments that can also be found in C. nivalis include violaxanthin and fadonirubin. Role in environmental processes and research Visible algal blooms could be a crucial determinant of surface albedo.Cook. J. M.; Hodson, A. J.; Taggart, A. J.; Mernild, S. H.; Tranter, M. (2017). ‚ÄúA predictive model for the spectral ‚Äúbioalbedo‚Äù of 30 snow‚Äù. J. Geophys. Res. Earth Surf. 122 (1). doi:10.1002/2016JF003932, 2017. It has been suggested that algal blooms partially composed of C. nivalis may contribute to lowering ice and snow albedo. The red coloured pigments produced by the cell in combination with inorganic material could enhance the darkening over the snow and reduce the surface area of white snow.Cook, J.M.; Hodson, A.; Gardner, A. S.; Flanner, M.; Tedstone, A. J.; Williamson, C.; et al (2017). ‚ÄúQuantifying bioalbedo: a new physically based model and discussion of empirical methods for characterising biological influence on ice and snow albedo‚Äù. The Cryosphere. 11: 2611-2632. doi: 10.5194/tc-11-2611-2017 Due to the absorption of solar energy by the alga, albedo would be reduced and the darker areas on the snow where the blooms form would melt more rapidly. As a result, populations of C. nivalis would increase, creating a feedback loop that amplifies melting and reduces sunlight absorbance which contributes to glacier retreat and lowering albedo, as shown experimentally. This is concerning to environmentalists and climate scientists.Thomas, W. H.; Duval, B. (1995). ‚ÄúSierra Nevada, California, U.S.A., snow algae: snow albedo changes, algal-bacterial interrelationships, and ultraviolet radiation effects‚Äù. Arct. Alp.

C. nivalis is likely to have strong antioxidant capabilities, a robust repair mechanism, and other components that may be of interest to researchers. Thermophilic microalgae have gained biotechnological interest as a source for thermostable enzymes and commercial interest as a source for astaxanthin.Varshney, P.; Mikulic, P.; Vonshak, A.; Beardall, J.; Wangikar, P.P.

Hamilton, the second book in her Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series. It continues the adventures of Anita Blake, as she attempts to solve a particularly grisly set of murders, while simultaneously avoiding two potential threats to her life from people interested in using her talents as a zombie animator. Meanwhile, Anita continues to attempt to come to grips with her powers and her relationship with Jean-Claude, the vampire master of St. Louis and Anita's would be lover/master. A comic book adaptation of The Laughing Corpse was released in 2008, with the first volume of the collected issues achieving the New York Times Bestseller List for graphic books. Plot summary The Laughing Corpse takes place a month after the events of Guilty Pleasures and begins with Anita and her manager Bert visiting Harold Gaynor, a local millionaire that wants Anita to animate a 300-year-old corpse. He informs Anita that he'd be willing to pay millions of dollars for her to do this, even supplying a willing \\"white goat\\" that would be needed for an animation of that level. Anita immediately refuses the offer, with Bert agreeing not to take on the case after discovering that the \\"white goat\\" was a euphemism for a human sacrifice. Anita is later called in to a murder scene by Dolph, the head of the area's supernatural crimes unit. A family was discovered to be torn apart, with a child missing and possibly still alive. Anita theorizes that it would likely be a flesh-eating zombie as there was too much blood left at the scene and that only two people could raise and control a zombie of that power: herself and vaudun priestess Senora Dominga Salvador. The only other person capable of this feat, Peter Burke, recently died. Anita sets up a meeting with Salvador through her mentor Manny Rodriguez, where she discovers that Salvador is both very evil and very powerful. Salvador demonstrates her technique for capturing the souls of the dead and installing them in zombies, preventing the zombies from degrading and allowing further punishment of the dead. She invites Anita to become her partner and help create ensouled zombies for profit, to which Anita refuses and is chased out of the house by an unseen creature. At the funeral for Peter Burke, Anita meets the deceased's brother John Burke, who is also a powerful vaudun priest and capable of committing the zombie murders. Later that day Anita also meets up with Irving Griswold, who supplies her with information on Gaynor, including the name of one of Gaynor's former lovers, Wheelchair Wanda. Irving then tries to get Anita to reveal who the current Master of the City is, only for Irving to discover that it is Jean-Claude after he appears in an attempt to persuade Anita to accept her position as his human servant. That evening Anita investigates a cemetery where remains of one of the murdered family members was discovered and through her powers discovers that a grave has been recently disturbed, with another being empty. The tombstone for the empty grave has been smashed, with Anita finding a charm bracelet. Anita takes some pieces of the tombstone and the bracelet to an associate that is a touch clairvoyant, who reluctantly tells her that the charm bracelet belonged to a woman sacrificed to raise a zombie. Anita is later attacked several times, once by zombies in her apartment and again later by thugs who attempt to kidnap her and her friend Ronnie. The two manage to foil the kidnapping attempt and discover that the thugs were working for Gaynor. Anita eventually visits the town's red light district with Jean-Claude, who helps her intimidate Wheelchair Wanda into talking about Gaynor and divulging that he is obsessed with the idea of finding a historic family treasure and getting revenge. Anita is called to another crime scene so recent that she believes that the zombie might be still hiding in the neighborhood. Dolph begins a search of the neighborhood as well as authorizing Anita to show John his brother's possessions in an attempt to discover any involvement in the murders. Through this she discovers that Peter possessed a gris-gris that contained a portion of the power of a powerful vaudun practitioner that would increase the power of any animator who possessed it. With John, Anita and the police confront Salvador with the gris-gris, which is revealed to be hers. Her grandson Antonio then confesses that he was supposed to remove the charm after Peter's death and now fears what punishment he might receive for this failure. The police discover a video of the events relating to the charm, and with the confession they then arrest Salvador. Anita then returns to the latest crime scene, where she is attacked by the zombie and lays it to rest. Upon returning home Anita is kidnapped by Gaynor's bodyguards and taken to his home, where Anita finds that Salvador has used her influence to gain bail. Gaynor informs Anita that he and Salvador are going to force Anita to raise a relative of Gaynors using his ex-lover Wheelchair Wanda, who has also been kidnapped. Anita refuses, which prompts Salvador to go to another room to begin a spell that would compel Anita to obey her. Anita manages to kill the bodyguards holding them captive and tries to escape with Wanda, only for the compulsion spell to force her to return to the cemetery near Gaynor's home. At the cemetery Salvador informs Anita that she gave Peter a gris-gris to raise his power enough to raise Gaynor's ancestor, as she was unwilling to perform a human sacrifice in front of witnesses. However, because Gaynor's ancestor was an animator, he rose as an uncontrollable flesh-eating zombie and Burke was murdered to keep the animation a secret. Salvador orders Anita to \\"perform human sacrifice\\", but due to a loophole in the spell Anita only has to perform the command literally and kills the guards holding Wanda. The resulting power from their sacrifice allows Anita to raise and control every corpse in the cemetery and she commands them to kill both Salvador and Gaynor. Anita then lays the zombies to rest. In the epilogue Anita explains that the \\"disappearances\\" of Salvador and Gaynor have never been solved, that she continues to refuse Jean-Claude, and that she is now considering the extent and implications of the power she now realizes she has.

A non-religious conscientious objector can qualify, despite what the law says, as long as his > opposition to war stem[s] from the registrant's moral, ethical, or religious > beliefs about what is right and wrong and that these beliefs [are] held with > the strength of traditional religious convictions.398 U.S. 333 Welsh v. > U.S., 15 June 1970 =Effect on government revenue and spending= The legislation itself notes that \\"The Joint Committee on Taxation has certified that a tax trust fund, providing for conscientious objector taxpayers to pay their full taxes for non-military purposes, would increase Federal revenues.\\" This presumably because some war tax resisters would return to paying taxes. There would be some additional cost in implementing and accounting for such a distinct fund and in providing mechanisms for taxpayers to use it. The act would not directly reduce either the amount of money the federal government spends on the military nor the percentage of the federal budget that goes to military spending. The National Priorities Project, using a similar definition of \\"military purpose\\" as is in this bill, estimates that \\"[m]ilitary spending consumes 26 cents out of every individual income tax dollar. It makes up about 20% of total federal spending and over half of the discretionary budget.\\" The bill would only directly affect the amount of military spending if the general fund were to become smaller than the amount to be spent on the military. If that were to happen, the government would either have to borrow money to make up the difference, illegally dip into the Peace Tax Fund, or reduce military spending. How many people would have to become conscientious objectors to military taxation for this to happen? If, for simplicity's sake, we assume that likely conscientious objectors to military taxation currently pay on average about the same amount of taxes as everyone else, in order to make any reduction to the 26% of every tax dollar that is spent for military purposes, more than 74% of taxpayers would have to declare themselves conscientious objectors. If we factor in deficit spending and taxes that are not covered by the Act (such as the corporate income tax and excise taxes), that percentage rises to over 90%. History In the United States, legislation that would establish a \\"Peace Tax Fund\\" has been proposed in Congress since 1972. The United States House of Representatives held hearings on the proposal in 1992 and 1995. In the 116th Congress, the bill, , is sponsored by Representative John Lewis and has one cosponsor.https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th- congress/house-bill/4169/all-info?r=2&s;=2#cosponsors Some taxpayers asserted that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which became law in 1993, should necessitate legalizing conscientious objection to military taxation. The Second Circuit Court and Third Circuit Court are the highest courts to hear this argument, and they disagreed.Adams v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 170 F.3d 173 (3rd Circuit 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1117 (2000), and Browne v.

The church was formed in 1859-60 but traces its roots to 1803 as the F Street Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and another congregation founded in 1820 on its current site, the Second Presbyterian Church. It is located at the intersection of 13th Street and New York Avenue in the city's northwest quadrant, four blocks from the White House. Due to its proximity to the White House, a number of US presidents have attended services there.  Beginnings  The F Street Church was established in 1803 with James Laurie as pastor by leaders of the Associate Reformed movement, known as Covenanters, who had seceded from the Church of Scotland in the mother country and retained a separate identity in North America. After holding initial worship services in the U.S. Treasury building, in 1807 the congregation began meeting, still under the leadership of Dr. Laurie, in an imposing brick building that stood where the F Street entrance to the Willard Hotel today opens on to Peacock Alley‚Äîjust two blocks from the church's present location on New York Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets, NW. The F Street Church, or Willard Hall, was one of the first buildings erected in Washington for Protestant worship. In 1824 Laurie led the congregation out of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian group to join the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), which represented the mainstream of American Presbyterianism descended from the state-established Church of Scotland. The Second Presbyterian Church, also a congregation of the PCUSA, was organized in 1820 by 16 families from the Bridge Street Presbyterian Church in Georgetown, at the time a separate town from Washington City. These members found their church too distant for regular attendance over the often muddy streets connecting the White House area and Georgetown. Pastored until 1828 by the Rev. Daniel Baker, the Second Church congregation included three of the four candidates for president in 1824. Andrew Jackson‚Äôs wife described Baker as ‚Äúa fine, plain preacher,‚Äù and John Quincy Adams was an early pew holder as Secretary of State and ultimately served as a trustee. In those days, Presbyterians were divided by the Old School‚ÄìNew School Controversy. The New School was ardently evangelistic and revivalist, and abandoned strict Calvinism for a theology of free will; the Old School was more doctrinally rigid and fearful of too much emotion. Second Church experienced an Old School/New School division, suffered financial hardship in covering the cost of its new building, and became involved in a scandal involving a member of President Jackson's cabinet. By the 1850s, it was barely functioning. Finally, in 1859, the F Street Church, pastored by Rev. Dr. Phineas Densmore Gurley, an Old School Presbyterian who had been called in 1853 following Dr. Laurie's death, merged with Second Presbyterian to form the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church under Dr. Gurley. Symbolically, as a church in the young and burgeoning city, the NYAPC took its name from the avenue that separated it from the often malodorous tanyard on its south side. Not surprisingly, the new church was erected with a bold vision for the future, for although its membership stood at 291, the new sanctuary and a gallery added later accommodated more than three times that number.  Beyond a Building  Ultimately, though, it is what happened in this first church building, and its larger 1951 successor on the same site, that matters. The ministers of this church have repeatedly had the opportunity to speak truth to power. In addition to Adams, Jackson, and Lincoln, other Presidents of the United States attended services to hear their preaching, including William Henry Harrison, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Benjamin Harrison, Dwight David Eisenhower, and Richard Milhous Nixon, as well as members of their Cabinets, Congress, and the Supreme Court. President Lincoln worshiped regularly at New York Avenue Presbyterian Church during the American Civil War. Lincoln rented a pew for $50 a year.Mr. Lincoln's White House: New York Avenue Presbyterian Church Lincoln and Rev. Gurley developed a relationship in which they frequently discussed theology.Mr. Lincoln's White House: Rev. Phineas D. Gurley (1816-1868) Gurley presided over the funeral of Lincoln's son, William Wallace Lincoln, in 1862, and then over the funeral of Lincoln himself in 1865. Rev. Gurley had an \\"insider's\\" perspective of Lincoln's faith, and reported it as follows: > \\"I have had frequent and intimate conversations with him on the Subject of > the Bible and the Christian religion, when he could have had no motive to > deceive me, and I considered him sound not only on the truth of the > Christian religion but on all its fundamental doctrines and teachings. And > more than that, in the latter days of his chastened and weary life, after > the death of his son Willie, and his visit to the battlefield of Gettysburg, > he said, with tears in his eyes, that he had lost confidence in everything > but God, and that he now believed his heart was changed, and that he loved > the Savior, and, if he was not deceived in himself, it was his intention > soon to make a profession of religion.\\" Peter Marshall The Rev. Peter Marshall preached many famous sermons from the church's pulpit during World War II. In the late 1940s, Marshall was appointed Senate chaplain. The book and feature film, A Man Called Peter, depict Marshall's memorable years at the church. The Rev. Dr. George MacPherson Docherty preached a Lincoln Day sermon on February 7, 1954, to a congregation that included President Eisenhower. The sermon, titled \\"A New Birth of Freedom,\\" is credited with prompting the U.S. Congress to amend the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States, inserting the phrase Lincoln used at Gettysburg, \\"under God.\\" Rev. Dr. George Docherty (left) and President Eisenhower (second from left) on the morning of February 7, 1954, at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church At the invitation of Dr. Docherty, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke from New York Avenue's pulpit to warn about the consequences of the war in Vietnam. And, more recently, the church twice served as a host for the Christian Witness for Peace for Iraq in its efforts to call into question the war there. Service to city and country and hospitality to all who enter this church are part and parcel of this place. Led by the Rev. Peter Marshall, the church opened its doors to the young men and women who streamed into Washington to fight or to support those who fought in World War II. NYAPC ministers, Dr. Docherty and the Rev. Jack E. McClendon, journeyed to Selma to march for civil rights with Dr. King. The church served as a haven for protestors of the Vietnam War and the center for publicity and public information for the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign in Washington in the spring of 1968. New York Avenue became a destination for prayer and comfort for many on September 11, 2001. And in January 2009, the church welcomed hundreds of the thousands of people who journeyed to the capital for President Barack Obama‚Äôs inauguration, providing food, drink, tours, and a warm place on a cold day‚Äî‚Äúa Godly pit-stop,‚Äù in the words of one visitor. For many years, the church has hosted the Jewish High Holiday celebrations of Fabrangen Havurah. These services, which are free and open to all, annually draw hundreds from in and around the city.  Ministries in the City  The 1960s and 70s saw the creation of several ministries‚Äî for Washington, DC‚Äôs junior high and high school students as well as the homeless, the mentally ill, and the hungry‚Äîthat continue still. Some 1,200 people come to the building on a weekly basis for a wide range of purposes‚Äîto meet with a tutor in Community Club or a social worker at the McClendon Center, receive a cup of coffee or an article of needed clothing through the Radcliffe Room ministry for the homeless, attend one of a number of AA meetings, or worship with one of the four congregations the church hosts. New York Avenue‚Äôs current pastor and head of staff, Roger J. Gench, and members of the congregation also serve directly in the community as active participants in the Washington Interfaith Network (WIN), a broad-based, multi-racial, multi-faith, and non-partisan citizens‚Äô organization of local congregations and associations committed to training and developing neighborhood leaders, addressing community issues, and holding elected and corporate officials accountable. The church also extends beyond the boundaries of the metro region and the nation in many ways, but particularly through support‚Äîfinancial and otherwise‚Äîfor a program for orphans sponsored by the Presbyterian Church in Njoro, Kenya, and a partnership with First Presbyterian-Reformed Church of Havana, Cuba. For several years, First Havana and New York Avenue‚Äôs congregations have reached out to one another, developing friendships and, more recently as downtown churches in capital cities, intentionally modeling reconciliation for their respective nations. New York Avenue is a church that continuously strives to discern the role it is called to play in and from its building on this corner of Washington, DC. This is a church that is reformed and always reforming, and this place of worship and service reflects that longstanding tradition. Rev. Gench has served as pastor and head of staff since 2002. He was formerly senior minister of Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland. Rev. Gench's wife, Frances Taylor Gench, is a nationally known Biblical scholar and faculty member at Union Theological Seminary & Presbyterian School of Christian Education in Richmond, Virginia. In January 2010, the church inaugurated a new, 3-manual, 63-rank Schlueter pipe organ, with the dedicatory concert performed by virtuoso organist Douglas Major.

It is called Moor Park Mansion because it is in the old park of the Manor of More. It now serves as the clubhouse of Moor Park Golf Club. The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England, and the landscaped park is listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. History After The More became a ruin, in about 1617 the 3rd Earl of Bedford built a new house on the hill to the southwest of the old palace, within the deer park. The house was rebuilt in 1678‚Äì1679 for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and inherited by his wife, Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, after he was beheaded. She sold it to Benjamin Haskins-Stiles, who had made a fortune in the South Sea Company before the notorious bubble burst; the current appearance of the mansion can be traced to him.Furtado, p120. Styles had the house remodelled in the 1720s. The principal architect was Giacomo Leoni,Furtado, p120. initially assisted by the painter Sir James Thornhill. Leoni refaced the house with Portland stone and added a great Corinthian portico on the south front and Tuscan colonnades (since removed). Inside, Thornhill was commissioned to paint the Great Hall and the Grand Stair,Hudson, pp657-661. complete with a dome in imitation of St. Peter's, Rome. However, Thornhill quarrelled with Styles and left the project before its completion. The paintings on the Grand Stair date from 1732 and depict the Origin of the Seasons from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Francesco Sleter, a Venetian artist who studied under Jacopo Amigoni. All that remains of Styles's work on the Grand Stair is a panel over a doorway, uncovered during restoration work in 2002. After Styles's falling-out with Thornhill, Amigoni was commissioned to paint the four pictures in the Great Hall‚Äîthe story of Jupiter and Io, also from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The wall paintings in the erroneously named Thornhill Room are probably by Sleter and Amigoni, while the ceiling, which depicts Aurora and the Dawn, was painted somewhat earlier, by Antonio Verrio. Moor Park in the 1780s. In 1752 the house was bought by Admiral Lord Anson, who commissioned Capability Brown to remake the formal gardens in sweeping \\"landscape style\\" with a small lake. Horace Walpole was not impressed: \\"I was not much struck with it, after all the miracles I had heard Brown had performed there. He has undulated the horizon in so many artificial molehills, that it is full as unnatural as if it was drawn with a rule and compasses.\\"Walpole to George Montagu, 4 July 1760. In 1785 the house was purchased by Thomas Bates Rous formerly of the East India Company and MP for Worcester. After excessive election expenses he was in need of cash and demolished part of the building for its valuable stone.Moor Park Mansion Further owners succeeded at regular intervals until the enlarged estate was sold to the Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury in 1828. Earl Grosvenor, son of the Duke of Westminster, built the gateway at Batchworth Heath and planted the pleasure grounds with trees and ornamental shrubs. It is said that the commercial strawberry, a hybrid of the European strawberry and a Chilean species, was first cultivated in the kitchen gardens of Moor Park, as had been the \\"Moorpark\\" fuzzless apricot in an earlier day. Lord Leverhulme purchased Moor Park and commissioned golf-course designer Harry Colt to lay out the courses that now surround the mansion. These opened in 1923. During the Second World War, the mansion was requisitioned, becoming the Headquarters of the 1st Airborne Corps, who there planned Operation Market Garden, the abortive mission to capture the bridges of the Lower Rhine in 1944. The operation was planned in a first-floor room, now named \\"the Arnhem Room\\". Moor Park Golf Club now has its clubhouse in the building, and since buying the freehold of the mansion in 1994 has completely restored and refurbished the building and paintings.

As such, it is regarded as the earliest widespread complex trace fossil.

Description Treptichnus pedum fossil marking the Cambrian-Ediacaran GSSP Treptichnus pedum has a fairly complicated and distinctive burrow pattern: along a central, sometimes sinuous or looping burrow it made successive probes upward through the sediment in search of nutrients, generating a trace pattern reminiscent of a fan or twisted rope. The organism that left such traces is considered more complex than earlier Ediacaran fauna; and these trace fossils, which occur worldwide, are usually found in strata above those. Since only its burrows have been found, it is presumed that the Treptichnus animal lacked any hard anatomical features, such as shells or bones. Its morphology and relationship to modern animals is therefore unknown, and some dispute even its inclusion within the animal kingdom. Despite this lack of fossil evidence, surface trails produced by modern priapulid worms exhibit the same probing morphology as Treptichnus, suggesting a close anatomical relationship between the trace- maker and modern priapulids.

It was disbanded by the Soviet occupying authorities in the fall of 1939, following Soviet attack on Eastern Poland. In early months of the war, members of Junak created the White Couriers, a boyscouting organization, which smuggled hundreds of persons from the area of Lviv to Hungary, across the Soviet-Hungarian border in the Carpathians.  History  In 1922, a sports club Czarni was founded in Drohobych. In 1930 it changed name to Strzelec, and later, in 1931 ‚Äì to Junak. For the first few years, the new team did not achieve anything significant in Polish soccer, lagging far behind top teams from Lviv. Crucial was the year 1937 ‚Äì in March, Captain Mieczyslaw Mlotek from Drohobycz's Polish Army garrison was elected president of the club. He was a great fan of soccer. Using his influences, Mlotek organized Junak's council, which included the most influential citizens of the town (among them ‚Äì the mayor of Drohobycz). Drohobych, as well as adjacent town of Boryslav, were interwar centers of Polish oil mining. With the help of numerous factories and local governments of both towns, Junak developed very fast. Numerous players were bought, mostly from renowned teams of Cracovia and Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, and in the spring of 1939 the team won local games of the Lw√≥w region, beating, among others, Czarni Lw√≥w, Ukraina Lw√≥w, Resovia Rzesz√≥w and Polonia Przemy≈õl. Junak's matches were very popular, with up to 5000 fans watching them. Supporters would come not only from Drohobycz, but also from Boryslaw and Schodnica (Skhidnytsia now). Junak's fans were regarded as very rowdy: Polish writer Andrzej Chciuk, who was born and raised in Drohobycz, wrote: \\"As long as Junak played in C or B class, regular fans came to these games. The team, however, played better and better, and its supporters were worse and worse. They toured the country with the team, as many as 2,000 of them. Arrival of such a crowd to Stryj, Boryslaw or Stanislawow (now Ivano- Frankivsk) meant trouble for those cities. Those who could not afford to go to away games gathered in front of Drohobycz post office, to listen to updates of the match\\".Robert Gawkowski, Sport w II Rzeczpospolitej, page 59-60 Before reaching play-offs for Ekstraklasa, Junak had to overcame more teams. In June and July 1939, the Drohobycz's side beat Unia Lublin (6‚Äì0 and 3‚Äì4), Policyjny KS Luck (7‚Äì0 and 3‚Äì2) and Strzelec-Gorka Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (6‚Äì1 and 0‚Äì4). Junak must have been a good team, which was proved in friendly games in the spring and early summer of 1939. It tied 2‚Äì2 with Cracovia, 3‚Äì3 with Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, also beat 2‚Äì1 the amateur champion of Hungary.  1939 ‚Äì Play offs for Ekstraklasa  On 13 August 1939 Junak played the first game of the play-offs. In Pozna≈Ñ, against Legia, the score was good (1‚Äì1). Then, on 20 August, at home, in a disappointing game versus ≈ölƒÖsk ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice, neither side scored. The next home game, planned on September 10, against ≈ömig≈Çy Wilno, never took place, because of German and Soviet invasions on Poland. It is difficult to speculate if Junak would have won promotion (out of participating 4 teams, 3 were going to be promoted). Team's officials had far-reaching plans, hoping to win the Championship of Poland as early as in 1940. Allegedly, Junak planned to purchase Ernest Willimowski ‚Äì the forward player of both Ruch Chorz√≥w and Polish national team, by far the best player in interwar Poland. Also, at the beginning of 1939, Junak bought another star of Polish soccer, Boles≈Çaw Habowski from Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w.

This is like natural canyon caused by the effect of wind and water erosion on red laterite soil. Khoai is called part of the India's natural heritage.  History  Khoai at Shantiniketan The Khoai can only support certain types of plants. It is a very poor soil for most types of agriculture practiced in the areas in which it is found. Yet often, a khoai maybe situated adjacent to a naturally forested area. Although a large area in Birbhum is covered by laterite, the areas where the laterite is exposed is termed as Khoai. In some areas the laterite is covered by a layer of ordinary soil and can support normal vegetation. In these areas, there are rice fields or mango groves or different varieties of plantations. These areas are not termed as khoai. In khoai areas there is no vegetation. Except for certain types of trees like Sonajhuri or Acacia, nothing grows on khoai. The beauty of khoai in and around Bolpur, Santiniketan enthralled Rabindranath Tagore and he immortalized khoai in his numerous writings.

Readers theater is a style of theater in which the actors present dramatic readings of narrative material without costumes, props, scenery, or special lighting. Actors use only vocal expression to help the audience understand the story. Readers theater is also known as \\"theater of the mind\\", \\"interpreters theater\\", and \\"story theater\\", and performances might be called \\"reading hours\\" or \\"play readings\\". History The form of readers theater is similar to the recitations of epic poetry in fifth‚Äìcentury Greece and public readings in later centuries by Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. Although group dramatic readings had been popular since at least the early 1800s, the first use of the term \\"readers theater\\" is attributed to a New York group. In 1945, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. and Henry Alsberg established the Readers Theater group, which presented Oedipus Rex at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway. Professional readers theater In 1949, a national readers theater tour by the First Drama Quartet‚ÄîCharles Laughton, Agnes Moorehead, Charles Boyer, and Cedric Hardwicke‚Äîappeared in 35 states, putting on 500 performances. Their presentation of Don Juan in Hell was seen by more than a half-million people. Columbia Masterworks recorded a performance, which was later re-released in .mp3 format by Saland Publishing. The Wall Street Journal described it as \\"No set, no props, just four actors in evening dress seated on stools placed behind music stands, reading Shaw's words out loud.\\" Brooks Atkinson in the New York Times called it \\"a mighty and moving occasion, not only a performance but an intellectual crusade.\\" Harris Yulin along with Ed Asner, Rene Auberjonois and Mira Furlan formed the Second Drama Quartet in 1994 and also performed Shaw‚Äôs Don Juan in Hell. Other actors who participated with the Second Drama Quartet included Gena Rowlands, Dianne Wiest, Harold Gould, David Warner, Martin Landau, and Charles Durning. Multiple professional productions have made use of readers theater techniques, including the 1967 production of the You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown musical. Readers theater in education Six readers from Southwest Missouri State University performed Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine at the 1960 Convention of the Speech Association of America. The University of Arkansas began a readers theater program in 1971. The Texas State Junior College Speech tournament in 1975 included a Readers Theater competition. High schools and universities began incorporating readers theater into their drama curriculum, and interpretive readings became a popular competitive event at state, regional, and national forensics tournaments. In the 1990s, the use of readers theater as a learning strategy spread to elementary and middle schools. Dramatic readings for different subject areas, such as history, science, and sociology, are recommended as a way to engage students, as well as to animate the subjects. Textbook publishers now offer readers theater scripts along with other educational materials. Characteristics A key difference between traditional theater and readers theater is that readers theater is not staged or acted out through physical movement. The interpretation of the dramatic reading relies almost entirely on the actors' voices. Although the early readers theater groups used only scripts and stools, the choice to read or memorize and whether to remain seated or allow movement vary according to the desires of the performing group. Readers theater can dramatize non-dramatic literature, such as a novel or short story or poem, and often includes a \\"narrator\\" role which might be a character in the story or a nonparticipating witness.

The station, owned by iHeartMedia, serves the New York's Capital District and surrounding areas, including the portions of the Mid-Hudson and upper Hudson Valley. WGY-FM's signal can be heard as far away as Hudson and Catskill to the south, Pittsfield and North Adams to the east, Warrensburg and Glens Falls to the north, and Amsterdam and Cobleskill to the west. History =Easy listening= WGY-FM first signed on in 1966 with an easy listening format under the moniker Whirl and the call letters WHRL. The easy listening format lasted in some form or another for much of the next two decades, evolving to a soft adult contemporary approach in 1987. Listeners of the station prior to '87 recall WHRL being an \\"elevator music\\" station. = \\"Today's Jazz\\" 103.1 FM WHRL = 103.1 FM WHRL was an adult contemporary/smooth jazz radio station from 1987 to October 1999. In 1988, the station flipped to a new age/jazz format, and became known as \\"Easy 103.1\\" and \\"The Breeze\\". Around 1995, WHRL officially picked up the all-smooth jazz format. WHRL enjoyed success in its format. Radio & Records reported on WHRL's \\"net gains\\" success on August 25, 1995, noting \\"WHRL/Albany climbed from about a half share to over two in the same demo for a 214% increase.\\" Similarly, in 1997, Radio & Records reported that \\"WHRL surged 2.5-3.4 12+.\\" Before transitioning to all-smooth jazz, WHRL had played operas on the weekend and big band, only playing smooth jazz on the morning drive, but these were scrapped and WHRL added dayparts, or segments during the day, of smooth jazz. The change was well received. Brant Curtiss, the Operations Manager at the time said that \\"listener reaction, via phones and e-mail, has been extremely positive. WHRL went from two or three daily complaints (some urging them to convert more quickly) to a over dozen listeners each day asking for title and album information of the new music they had begun playing. Smooth jazz is not just wallpaper music in Albany.\\" At this time, the new smooth jazz format was marketed with word-of-mouth because there was not the kind of budget for massive television and print like jazz stations in larger markets could afford. In this effort, WHRL launched its website in 1997, as well as a \\"Jazz Club\\" that listeners could join. In going through this change to all-smooth jazz, WHRL more than doubled its cume (cumulative audience) from 1996 to 1997. In its tenure, WHRL went by \\"Easy 103.1,\\" \\"The Breeze\\" and \\"Today's Jazz.\\" The station's \\"Today's Jazz\\" iteration logo had 103.1 on top of \\"TODAY'S JAZZ\\" written in a stylized font, above the station number which appeared on the bottom. Today's Jazz used clips from Spyro Gyra's \\"Morning Dance\\" and Rick Braun's \\"Club Harlem\\" featuring Peter White as bumpers. WHRL aimed for \\"stress management\\" with its song list and format. In 1999, Brant Curtiss, then DJ, Station Programmer, and Director/Creative Services for WHRL described the station: \\"Our ratings rise continuously through the day. During evenings with our Today's Jazz Tonight and Lights Out programs, the numbers go through the roof - No. 1 and 2 in certain demos - and we are kicking the hell out of 41 stations in Albany. That's because the format fits the function, and our function is stress management. When people leave work and are driving home, we're like a decompression chamber for them. It's sad, but our morning show is almost not a factor: middays are more like morning for us. That doesn't mean you should waste mornings; you've got to go after it. With great songs like \\"Urban Turban,\\" Kombo and Brian Tarquin's \\"Darlin' Darlin' Baby,\\" you can pump up your sound. They have very strong hooks. Songs that are very smooth complement them and offer balance.\\"  Ownership and management  Dame Media Inc. purchased WHRL, a 6,000-watt station, in 1996 from Regal Broadcasting, Inc. of Rensselaer. Dame Media paid $2.63 million. That year, Congress had enacted new ownership rules raising the limit in the market size of the Capital Region from four stations to seven. The enactment precipitated a seller's market. At the time of Dame Media's purchase, WHRL had a 1.7 percent share of listeners aged 12 and up putting it in 12th place in the area. In 1994, the station had a revenue of $500,000. In 1997, Dame Media hired Peter Baumann as station manager of WHRL \\"Today's Jazz.\\" Previously, Baumann had been director of sales for other Capital District Radio Stations WPYX and WTRY. Another Dame Media hire in that year was Brant Curtiss as operations manager for WHRL. Previously Curtiss had been production director of WTPA/WVNC in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Dame Media Inc. was acquired by Clear Channel Communications Inc. in 1998 for $85 million in stock and debt.  WHRL activities and promotions  Today's Jazz produced its own smooth jazz compilations from time to time. In 1998 the station released a compilation album with nine tracks that was available retail at Hollywood Video and sold for $7.95. A portion of the proceeds from the purchase of the compilation benefited the Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization. The track list included songs by Spyro Gyra, Diana Krall, George Benson, and Lee Ritenour. The station published a newsletter called \\"WHRL Smooth Jazz Scene\\" that featured \\"the lowdown on upcoming events plus cool photos of your favorite WHRL personalities.\\" The newsletter could be picked up in the Capitol region at over twenty retail locations. In 1997, WHRL acquired a station van named \\"Miles\\" that had the 103.1 \\"Today's Jazz\\" logo emblazoned on the side.  1999 transfer of smooth jazz to 104.9 FM WZMR  After Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) purchased Dame Media in 1999, WHRL's future became cloudy and rumors of a format change circulated. Clear Channel Communications decided to discontinue the smooth jazz programming on WHRL-FM in 1999. The decision was met with public outcry. In response to the public support of WHRL-FM, Albany Broadcasting's (now Pamal Broadcasting) WZMR-FM Albany/Schenectady/Troy decided to pick up the discarded smooth jazz format. Albany Broadcasting's Vice President of Programming concurred. Today's Jazz WHRL continued to sponsor and promote jazz in the Capital Region right up until its departure in October 1999; for example, WHRL sponsored A Night of Jazz at the New York State Museum on September 9, 1999 featuring a live performance by jazz guitarist Dwight Sills.  Smooth jazz exits 104.9  In June 2003, 104.9 incorporated smooth jazz and R&B; oldies as \\"104.9 Love FM\\" to reach a broader audience. However, by 2005, smooth jazz had permanently been taken off the air; in January 2005, 104.9 FM was still playing Christmas music, until it switched to a simulcast of \\"Froggy Country 107.1\\" in Glens Falls. =Channel 103-1= The smooth jazz format on 103.1 gave way to the modern rock-formatted Channel 103.1, on October 2, 1999 two weeks after former sister station WQBK-FM (now owned by Townsquare Media) flipped from modern rock to active rock; the first song played by Channel 103-1 was \\"Driven to Tears\\" by The Police. Slogans used by the station included \\"Albany's New Music Alternative\\", \\"Albany's New Rock Alternative\\", and eventually \\"Where You Rock\\" during its active rock format. In 2009, WHRL adopted Clear Channel's Premium Choice active rock format, becoming musically identical outside of morning drive to sister stations KBRU in Oklahoma City and KIOC in Beaumont. WHRL became the third active rock station in the Albany market in addition to competitors WZMR and WQBK-FM. During this period, the Albany market had the highest number of active rock stations for an American radio market, until WZMR flipped to country on February 26, 2010. However, when WHRL flipped to active rock in 2009, the Clear Channel-Regent non-compete clause, which was previously used when WBZZ flipped from Hot AC to AC, was invoked (as WQBK-FM is an active rock station) and led to the eventual flip to a talk radio simulcast of WGY. WHRL had already been reporting as an active rock station on Mediabase since 2008; Mediabase is owned by the station's parent company, iHeartMedia. Throughout its history as a rock format, the station was known for playing many alternative, punk, goth, emo, and metal bands and artists from about 1990 to the present, including Avenged Sevenfold, Disturbed, Korn, Linkin Park, Slipknot, and Atreyu. The station also held concerts known as the Channel 103-1 Big Day Out every summer until 2010, featuring modern and active rock artists. =WGY-FM= At 12:01 AM on September 20, 2010, after the song \\"New Divide\\" by Linkin Park, WHRL dropped its active rock format to simulcast sister station WGY, which runs a news-talk format; in addition, the station changed its callsign to the current WGY-FM. With WHRL switching from modern rock to active rock in 2009, only to drop it in favor of the WGY simulcast one year later, this leaves WEQX as the only modern rock radio station remaining in the Albany market. Despite being a rimshot station, WEQX is reported by Mediabase and Nielsen BDS as an Albany station. As of September 24, 2010, Channel 103.1's former website redirects to the website of sister station WPYX (PYX 106.5). HD Radio operations In 2005, WHRL upgraded to IBOC digital radio alongside the rest of Clear Channel's Albany stations. On August 17, 2006, WHRL began airing an HD2 channel with a \\"Classic Alternative\\" format. With WHRL dumping active rock for a WGY simulcast, the station's HD2 signal was changed from the classic alternative format to a simulcast of WOFX (Fox Sports 980) the same day.http://hdradio.com/stations Logos File:Whrl old.pngWGY-FM's first logo as WHRL Channel 103.1, 1999-2001 File:WHRLfinal.pngWGY-FM's final logo under the Channel 103.1 format, 2005‚Äì2010 File:New WGY logo.jpgWGY-FM's logo as WGY News Talk, 2010‚Äì2013 References External links GY-FM Radio stations established in 1966 IHeartMedia radio stations American radio stations with a three-letter call sign 1966 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"WGY-FM"},{"id":"4338484","text":"Mack Calvin (born July 27, 1947) is an American former basketball player.

He is best known for being the original bassist for the rock band AC/DC around November 1973, joining Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), Angus Young (lead guitar), Dave Evans (lead vocals) and Colin Burgess (drums). He was replaced in February 1974. Van Kriedt also plays saxophone, guitar and vocals. Early life Van Kriedt was born to a multi-instrumental family in San Francisco on July 4, 1954. His father was the renowned jazz musician David van Kriedt who composed, arranged played and recorded with such artists as Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond, Stan Kenton and many more. All of Larry‚Äôs life has been centered on music, particularly jazz. He began playing the double bass at age 9, guitar at 12, and added saxophone and vocals to the list at 15. He studied jazz, harmony, composition and musical arrangement with his father. In 1969, at age 15, his family moved to Sydney, New South Wales, Australia where he met Angus Young shortly after arrival. He started hanging out with Angus and his brother, Malcolm Young. Van Kriedt is described as being an accomplished jazz- influenced guitarist during this period. One of his first studio sessions was as the bassist in the original line-up of AC/DC in 1973. AC/DC In November 1973 he was asked to join the brand new band AC/DC by Malcolm Young. Shortly after, lead singer Dave Evans, drummer Colin Burgess and guitarist Angus Young joined. On December 31, 1973 the band performed their first ever live show. Four months later the band recorded the single \\"Can I Sit Next to You, Girl\\", although shortly afterwards Van Kriedt was fired and his bass lines were said to have been re-recorded by George Young (one of the older brothers of Malcolm and Angus). After this, he was replaced by Neil Smith. AC/DC employed a succession of bass players over the following few months. In January 1975 after Rob Bailey was fired, Paul Matters joined the group as bassist for live shows but his tenure was short-lived, being replaced by Mark Evans in March 1975. Until Axl Rose joined as a guest vocalist in 2016, Van Kriedt had been the only member in the group's history to be born in the US. Other bands Van Kriedt created his own band called Non Stop Dancers with Kevin Jones (guitar, vocals), Jane Stewart (keyboards), Karen Steains (bass), and Brett Van Kriedt (drums). They released one full length album, Surprise Surprise, in 1984. Personal life From 1997 to 1999, he lived in Morocco, working there as a musician with his band Afram doing radio, television and concerts such as the first Gnawa Festival in Essaouira in 1998, and raising money for the charity, B.A.Y.T.I. After leaving Morocco he travelled the world busking, that is, playing jazz on the street from London to Provence to Sydney. This was when he started making backing tracks of jazz standards. In 2002, Van Kriedt pioneered the first online downloadable jazz playalong backing track e-business, Jazzbacks.com. In 2007, he worked with Paul Agbakoba in The LPs.

The Lockyer Creek valley had been one of the driest catchments in Queensland during the recent droughts in Australia. Flood events During the 2011 Queensland floods, on 10 and 11 January the creek experienced severe flash flooding from overnight and daytime heavy rain in a catchment of about . During the floods the creek reached deep, a record that was higher than what was experienced during the 1974 Brisbane flood. The Bureau of Meteorology recorded a rise of in 23 minutes during the flash flood but initially dismissed the reading as a fault. It was estimated that 4,000 tonnes or of water per second flowed through Lockyer Creek, leading to the use of descriptive phrases such as \\"wall of water\\", or even \\"inland tsunami\\". Water rose approximately above the 1893 flood level recorded at the Lockyer Creek Railway bridge (see below). A report by GHD Group for the Brisbane City Council suggested that flood mitigating dams on Lockyer Creek and Bremer River could be a useful measure for flood proofing Brisbane.

Like the singlecut version of the LP Junior, it has a single \\"dog-eared\\" P-90 single coil pickup. This Les Paul doublecut is currently only available as a Gibson Custom Shop/Historic Reissue model, called the \\"1958 Junior Doublecut.\\" The Junior, in both its singlecut and doublecut forms, was originally Gibson's \\"student\\" model. The initial price of the Les Paul Junior was originally $49.50. = Les Paul Special Doublecut = It is also one of the least expensive Les Paul guitars available. It appears that Gibson has since decided to discontinue much of the faded lines, including the Les Paul Special Double cut for its 2009 lineup. A much more expensive and historically accurate version of this guitar, the 1960 Les Paul Special, is available as a Custom Shop/Historic Reissue model. For many years after 1960 no Les Paul Doublecut guitars were produced by Gibson, and when Gibson did start making doublecut Les Pauls again, they were re-issues closely following the original Les Paul Special flat-top (no carved maple cap) design, with P-90 pickups rather than humbucker pickups. In the interim, during the 1970s, a small boutique USA guitar producer, Hamer, began making both flat-top and carved-top doublecutaway guitars very similar to the then-dormant Gibson designs. These Hamer versions of doublecutaway Les Pauls got widespread publicity for their use by the members of the rock band Cheap Trick and others. = Les Paul Faded Doublecut = The Faded Doublecut has its origin in the Les Paul Special Doublecut, which is an all-mahogany flat-top guitar with P-90 pickups first produced from 1958‚Äì1960. The \\"Faded\\" model is called such because the nitrocellulose finish is not thick and glossy like the original vintage examples or Custom Shop double cut Les Pauls. This finish style is easily susceptible to play wear, thus many examples appear to have been \\"relic'ed\\" in the factory, but the wear is real. The body is composed of multiple mahogany (usually four) pieces and is sold with a gig-bag (as opposed to a hard-case). ;Doublecut design The Doublecut had one major design change: the original models had the neck pickup mounted closer to the neck/body join which resulted in a weak neck join. This was changed by moving the neck pick up further into the body. ;Other faded finish models The \\"Faded Doublecut\\" is one of a series (at least as of 2007) \\"faded\\" models being the SG, Les Paul (single cut with humbuckers) and Flying V. All of these models are made in the USA. = Les Paul Standard & Pro Doublecut = Gibson Les Paul DC (with stetsbar) The Les Paul Standard and Pro models of the doublecut LP are a newer concept, based on an arched-top Les Paul with humbucker pickups, similar to the Hamer design. The Pro has 22 frets; the Standard has 24 frets. The Standard \\"Plus\\" has gold hardware. Unlike other 2-pickup single cutaway Les Pauls, these Gibson doublecutaway versions have one master volume and one master tone control (singlecut Les Pauls with two pickups have two sets of tone and volume controls, one for each pickup). Many believe these newer archtop doublecut Les Pauls were developed in response to the high-end guitars of Gibson competitor Paul Reed Smith (PRS), whose PRS guitars most typically have a doublecut design and master tone and volume controls, and whose production eventually went from a small shop (as Hamer's has stayed) to an assembly-line production rivaling Gibson's. This opinion is further supported by the fact that the first of Gibson's archtop doublecut Les Pauls, the now-discontinued Les Paul Studio doublecut (produced in the late 1990s), had 24 frets, as opposed to Gibson's more standard 22 frets. 24-fret necks are featured on some PRS guitars, and are more popular with heavy metal players who often solo at the high end of the neck.

It grows to an average of high, and can grow as high as under good conditions. Its fruits' shape varies from round to oval, pointed at the distal end. When ripe, it has smooth, bright yellow skin and has one to four ovate seeds. The inside of the fruit is translucent and white. It has a creamy and jelly-like texture and its taste is similar to the sapodilla -- a sweet caramel custard. The abiu tree is part of the family Sapotaceae and is very similar in appearance to the canistel. Distribution P. caimito is commonly considered to be native to the headwaters of the Amazon. It grows wild in the lower eastern part of the Andes from southwestern Venezuela to Peru. It also grows around Tingo Maria and Iquitos, Peru, and it can commonly be found in the Province of Guayas in Ecuador, where it is sold in the markets. The abiu was cultivated by Amerindians and it became widespread in the Amazon, but the origins of the fruit's distribution outside the Amazon is uncertain. In the Amazon basin, it is found to grow heavily in the northern Brazilian state of Par√°, but is also found sparsely in collections from the Atlantic rainforest near Rio de Janeiro and Bahia.Harri Lorenzi, √Årvores Brasileiras - Manual de Identifica√ß√£o e Cultivo de Plantas Arb√≥reas Nativas do Brasil, S√£o Paulo, Plantarum, V. 2, quoted by It can also be found in Colombia in areas such as the regions of Caquet√°, Meta, and Vaupes and it is very plentiful in Amazonas, Venezuela. It has also been growing for a very long time in Trinidad. The abiu grows best in areas that have a year- round moist and warm climate. It can now be found throughout most of the Amazon basin. It is a common dooryard tree in the backyards and streets in the city of many Brazilian towns, but it is not usually grown commercially. It has also been introduced outside of the Americas; for example, it is grown on the Pacific island of Tahiti since 1993.https://www.tahitiheritage.pf/abiu- pouteria-caimito/The abiu habitats are nearly all tropical. It thrives in a place that has a year-round warm and moist climate, although it has been known to grow well in Rio de Janeiro, which is a somewhat cooler climate. In Peru, it cannot grow above feet in elevation, but in Colombia, it has been found growing up to an elevation of . Leaves Vernacular names The fruit is known by different regional names in countries of production; in Brazil, it is known as abiu, in Trinidad it is the yellow star apple or caimitt, there are also the purple and green skin caimitt varieties (distinct from the star apple); Colombians know it as the caimo, caimito amarillo (again not to be confused with Chrysophyllum cainito, which is known as caimito in some countries) or madura verde; in Ecuador it is known as the luma or cauje; in Venezuela as temare; in Portugal as abieiro; and in Ghana as alasa. It is also known as abio. Description The leaves of P, caimito range from oblong to elliptical. They can be 4-8 in (10-20 cm) in length and 1.5-2.5 in (3.5-6.5 cm) in width. The flowers on the tree may occur either single or in clusters of two to five flowers. They appear on the leaf axils on long, thin shoots. The flowers are small with four to five petals. The petals are cylindrical and are white to greenish in color. The flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they are both sexes. The flowers open in the morning and can stay open for about two days. = Fruit = A cross-sectioned abiu (P. caimito) fruit The fruit of P. caimito is typically 3-9 cm long and yellow when mature.The short-stemmed fruit breaks off cleanly. P. caimito seeds Mature abiu trees produce 100 to 1000 fruits each year. These have a pale, translucent pulp of a custard consistency that is easily scooped out with a spoon; also, a few bits of tougher gel may be found. The seeds are easily removed and are covered with a thin layer of adherent pulp. The fruit has a sweet, mild taste, which may have a hint of pineapple, but is best described as reminiscent of caramel flan. It is often used in ice cream or eaten out of hand. Unripe fruits contain a gummy and unpalatable latex that hardens upon exposure to air. The skin of the ripe fruit is a pale yellow color with a leathery texture and residual latex. Because mature fruits continue to ripen when picked, the harvest can be timed to allow for transportation to market. However, this period may be as short as five days. Maturation can be recognized by the pale green-to-yellow color break and the ripe fruit can be identified by its yellow coloration and a slight softness. Varieties  The abiu varies in form, size, and quality of the fruit. Some have soft and others firm flesh. Some taste bland while others have very nice flavor. In Colombia along the Putamayo River, one variety has large, round fruits that are produced after four years. In Vaupes, Colombia, a variety bears fruit just one year after seeding; however, these fruits are small and contain little pulp. Season P. caimito fruits at a Miami fruit stand in August Abiu may have several flowering periods a year, with potential for both flowers and fruit on the tree at one time. The development time from flower to ripe fruit is about 3 months. The main crop season varies by climate. In Ecuador, the fruits are in season during March and April, but may also produce in other times of the year. In some Brazilian markets, they are sold from September to April, but at this time, they are sparse. Bahia has a short season in February and March. In Florida, the fruits ripen from August to October. In northern Queensland, Australia, the main crop ripens January to March. Uses The wood of the abiu tree is dense, heavy, and hard and is used as lumber in construction. =Culinary= The fruit of the abiu tree is edible and considered one of the best of the sapotes due to having the sweet, caramel-like taste of sapodilla with a smoother texture. It is commonly eaten out of hand, although in Colombia, those eating the fruit this way are advised to grease their lips to keep the gummy latex from sticking; this hazard can be avoided by selecting fully ripe fruits and scooping out the flesh with a utensil. The tartness of a bit of added lime juice may enhance the flavor, especially when chilled. The melting, sweet pulp of the abiu is also used to flavor ice cream and cut into yogurt for a light and delicious breakfast. The subtlety of the flavor limits its use in more complex confections and salads. Abiu fruit is a significant source of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Cultivation Young tree The tree grows best in tropical areas and in places that have a warm, moist climate all year long, and is slightly less hardy than related sapotes such as the canistel and sapodilla (nispero). Within the United States, it grows well in South Florida as far north as Palm Beach County, and has survived brief freezes. It prefers wet, slightly acidic soil with high organic content, and may suffer from iron deficiency (chlorosis) in alkaline soils. A tree that has just been planted is fragile and needs protection from wind and cold weather. Only light pruning is necessary and feeding should be frequent, but light. =Propagation= Propagation is nearly always by seeds, but the fruit of seedling trees is variable. Fresh seeds need to be planted within a few days if they are to remain viable, and germinate in two to three weeks. The lower branches of the seedling may be pruned after a year, and the first fruit can be expected in three years, with substantial yields at five years. Grafting, budding, and air layering can be used to propagate superior strains and advance the production schedule. = Pests and diseases = The commercial value of the fruit in its native range is limited because it is often damaged by small insects. In Brazil, the main pest that destroys the fruit is thought to be the fruit fly. Thrips are known to attack buds, leaves, and young fruits, but in exotic locations, abiu can be relatively pest-free, especially if fruit is harvested at maturity and ripened off the tree.

Produced entirely by members of the expedition, the book was edited by Shackleton, illustrated with lithographs and etchings by George Marston, printed by Ernest Joyce and Frank Wild, and bound by Bernard Day.

The copyright notice from Aurora Australis notes its origins. Because the copies of Aurora Australis were unnumbered, it is unclear exactly how many were produced; it is believed that one hundred copies were created, of which less than seventy have been accounted for. Copies of the book are often identified by the original stencils on the inside of the covers, which were made of boards from wooden supply boxes.For example, the National Library of Australia's copy is known as 'Butter 267'.

It offers music, news, and entertainment programming from American Public Media, Public Radio Exchange, National Public Radio, and other nationally recognized public media outlets, as well as airing several local shows produced by WLRH staff and volunteers. WLRH provides three HD channels. HD1 is a digital version of the main WLRH signal, HD2 is a 24-hour classical music service, and HD3 provides news and talk. WLRH serves an area roughly 60 miles in all directions from its transmitter on Monte Sano, including north central Alabama and south central Tennessee, as well as Fort Payne via a translator. History Huntsville has boasted for many years a large population of highly educated, affluent professionals such as technicians, engineers, and entrepreneurs, mostly associated with the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal installation, NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and contractors. Many of these individuals were responsible for organizing an unusually high- quality performing arts scene for such a small city in the 1960s. These were among factors that led to Huntsville receiving Alabama's first public radio license, and broadcasts began on October 13, 1976 from the Times Building on Holmes Avenue. The state's largest city, Birmingham, followed suit two months later when WBHM started in December. The station was originally owned by the Huntsville Madison County Public Library; in fact the call letters stand for Library Radio Huntsville. However, just over a year after the station signed on, library officials realized they were in over their heads with operating a full-service radio station. The Alabama Educational Television Commission stepped in and bought the station in December 1977, and still owns it today. The station carried, as was customary for public stations during that era, mostly classical music programming, with jazz late nights and on weekends. In 1987, after significant listener growth, UAH offered the AETC use of a newly constructed facility on its campus, several miles to the west of downtown; WLRH took the offer and remains at that location today. In the early years, the station carried some unusual programs, most notably a weekly hour-long German-language news and features show for the benefit of several natives of that land who worked in Huntsville's aerospace and defense industry. It also was the home of northern Alabama's first call-in radio talk show, which had a very different flavor than those found on commercial stations today (in fact, when the format's popularity exploded elsewhere in the 1990s, WLRH dropped the show). In 2010 WLRH added 89.3 HD2, a 24-hour classical music service. It added 89.3 HD3 News/Talk in 2012. WLRH added a translator at 104.5 FM in Fort Payne, Alabama in 2018.

Operations WLRH is the Alabama Educational Television Commission's only radio property; that state government agency is better known as the operator of the Alabama Public Television network. One distinctive programming practice of WLRH is its frequent announcements throughout the broadcast day of underwriting day sponsorships made by individuals or families, in addition to the usual businesses and non-profit organizations. Usually, these messages honor birthdays or wedding anniversaries. Additionally, for more than 25 years, WLRH has offered a unique community service to its listening area. The WLRH PSA Program provides representatives from local non-profit and community organizations the opportunity to record 30 second public service announcements for their group or event for free. Other radio stations may also have a public service announcement program, but none provide such extensive coverage or prime-time placement. WLRH features PSAs on its 3 channels in all day parts, including morning and afternoon drive time. The PSAs are deeply integrated into all parts of on-air programming. For many of the non-profits that use it, PSA Program is the only way to connect with the communities they serve. WLRH offers two categories of PSAs. General PSAs share a group's service message for up to a year. Event PSAs provide information about a group's events and fundraisers. George Dickerson, a former South Bend, Indiana television news anchor, served as the only general manager in WLRH's entire history from its 1976 inception until his retirement in early 2007. It is believed that Dickerson's tenure was the longest ever for a manager of an American public radio station (and perhaps all public broadcasting), exceeding 30 years. Brett Tannehill has been WLRH's general manager since 2011.

History The school was started as an elementary school in the relatively affluent Memphis suburb of Germantown. Due to their success, parents asked for the addition of grades for a middle school and ultimately, high school. Through a number of turns, fortuitous grants from generous donors, and an unfortunate rift with the Episcopal Church, the school has expanded rapidly to its current three-campus configuration. The original elementary school still operates in Germantown. St. George's also partnered with Holy Trinity Episcopal Church to open an elementary school in an under-served section of Memphis, intending to model how an independent school could contribute to community transformation. They received a donation of land in the eastern Memphis suburb of Collierville, where they opened a middle and upper school campus that has rapidly grown. The Germantown campus (located at 8250 Poplar Avenue Germantown, TN 38138) was built in 1959, and is the oldest of the three campuses. It serves grades pre- kindergarten through fifth grade. The Memphis campus (located at 3749 Kimball Avenue Memphis, TN 38111) was the next to be founded, in 2001. It serves grades prekindergarten through fifth grade. The Collierville campus (located at 1880 Wolf River Blvd. Collierville, TN 38017) was founded in 2002, and serves grades six through 12. The Collierville campus has two wings, which divide the school into middle school (grades 6-8), and upper school (grades 9-12). Academics Academics at the Collierville campus follow a traditional high school curriculum and the graduation requirements are as follows: *English: 4 units (12 Trimesters) *History/Social Sciences: 3 units (9 trimesters) *Mathematics: 4 units (12 trimesters) *Language: 3 units (9 trimesters) *Arts: 1 (4 trimesters) *Religion 1 (3 trimesters) *Senior Independent Study(see section below): 2/3 (2 trimesters) *Electives: 2 (8 trimesters) =Senior Independent Study= The Senior Independent Study thesis takes one of two forms: either a substantial project accompanied by a ten-page process paper, or an original piece of research that concludes in a 15-25 page paper. SIS is a two-trimester program, the culmination of which is an oral defense of the student's work in front of a panel of faculty and administrators. During the third trimester, the students are presented with a constellation of real-world problems. Small teams of students choose one problem on which to focus. After two months, they present the answer to their problem in front of a panel of faculty judges. Both parts of the project are evaluated on a fail, pass, or pass with distinction basis. Seniors who successfully pass all levels of the senior thesis with distinction then graduate with distinction.

Biography Abbad arrived in Puerto Rico in 1771 at age 26 as confessor and personal secretary of the bishop of the diocese of Puerto Rico, Manuel Jim√©nez P√©rez. From 1772 to 1778, as part of his ecclesiastic duties, he visited many towns throughout the island. Also at that time, while accompanying Jim√©nez P√©rez, he visited Cuman√°, Isla Margarita, New Barcelona, the Orinoco River, Trinidad, and Venezuela. During these travels he kept a diary named Viage a la Am√©rica (Voyage to America). The book was published as a facsimile in 1974 at Caracas by Banco Nacional de Ahorro y Pr√©stamo (National Loan and Savings Bank). While living in Puerto Rico he observed and recorded every day Puerto Rican life. In 1788, ten years after leaving Puerto Rico, he published the first comprehensive history of Puerto Rico titled Historia geogr√°fica, civil y natural de la isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico (Geographic, civil and natural history of the island of Saint John the Baptist of Puerto Rico). In his book he described, in detail, a wide array of aspects of Puerto Rican life. Among the topics discussed are San Juan's fortifications and defenses, Ta√≠no customs, and Puerto Rican history, society, clothing, flora, fauna, socio-economic peculiarities, and personality. He also proposes several reforms such as free commerce and the promotion of agriculture and other industries. Even though Abbad's book is the most complete historical account of Puerto Rico from 1493 to 1783, many of the historical accounts presented were obtained from second-hand sources. The earliest known reference to the g√ºiro, an instrument used in traditional Puerto Rican music, is in his writings. He described the g√ºiro as one of several instruments that were used to accompany dancers. The other instruments would typically include maracas, tambourine, and one or more guitars. In 1785, Abbad wrote Relaci√≥n de la Florida (Florida Relation), an account of the Spanish presence in the Florida peninsula beginning with its discovery by Juan Ponce de Le√≥n up to the establishment of French and British colonies.

The search engine soon proved successful and the expanding company moved several times, finally settling at Mountain View in 2003. This marked a phase of rapid growth, with the company making its initial public offering in 2004 and quickly becoming one of the world's largest media companies. The company launched Google News in 2002, Gmail in 2004, Google Maps in 2005, Google Chrome in 2008, and the social network known as Google+ in 2011 (which was shut down in April 2019), in addition to many other products. In 2015, Google became the main subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet Inc. The search engine went through many updates in attempts to combat search engine optimization abuse, provide dynamic updating of results, and make the indexing system rapid and flexible. Search results started to be personalized in 2005, and later Google Suggest autocompletion was introduced. From 2007, Universal Search provided all types of content, not just text content, in search results. Google has engaged in partnerships with NASA, AOL, Sun Microsystems, News Corporation, Sky UK, and others. The company set up a charitable offshoot, Google.org, in 2005. The name Google is a misspelling of Googol, the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information. History Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003 The first Google computer at Stanford was housed in custom-made enclosures constructed from Mega Blocks.The Original GOOGLE Computer Storage (Page and Brin, 1996) Stanford Computer Science Computer History Display =Beginning= Google has its origins in \\"BackRub\\", a research project that was begun in 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.\\"Our history in Depth \\" Google, Retrieved on March 29, 2016 The project initially involved an unofficial \\"third founder\\", Scott Hassan, the lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company; Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006. In the search of a dissertation theme, Page had been considering among other things exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph.Battelle, John. \\"The Birth of Google .\\" Wired. August 2005. His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pick this idea (which Page later recalled as \\"the best advice I ever got\\"The best advice I ever got (Fortune, April 2008)) and Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, based on the consideration that the number and nature of such backlinks was valuable information about that page (with the role of citations in academic publishing in mind). Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas. The research project was nicknamed \\"BackRub\\", and it was soon joined by Brin, who was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. The two had first met in the summer of 1995, when Page was part of a group of potential new students that Brin had volunteered to give a tour around the campus and nearby San Francisco. Both Brin and Page were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP). The SDLP's goal was \\"to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\\" and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.The Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project, Award Abstract #9411306, September 1, 1994 through August 31, 1999 (Estimated), award amount $521,111,001 Page's web crawler began exploring the web in March 1996, with Page's own Stanford home page serving as the only starting point. To convert the backlink data that is gathered for a given web page into a measure of importance, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm. While analyzing BackRub's output which, for a given URL, consisted of a list of backlinks ranked by importance, the pair realized that a search engine based on PageRank would produce better results than existing techniques (existing search engines at the time essentially ranked results according to how many times the search term appeared on a page).Page, Lawrence, Brin, Sergey, Motwani, Rajeev, Winograd, Terry. \\"The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web .\\" November 11, 1999. Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies and laid the foundation for their search engine.Google I/O Conference is a big upcoming in 2015.Downloaded 11 ‚Äì February 2009 . Google IO Conferences. Retrieved on February 22, 2015 The first version of Google was released in August 1996 on the Stanford website. It used nearly half of Stanford's entire network bandwidth. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. H√©ctor Garc√≠a-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project. PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996. Larry Page's patent for PageRank filed in 1998 includes a citation to Li's earlier patent. Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu in 2000.\\"About: RankDex\\" , RankDex =Late 1990s= Originally the search engine used Stanford's website with the domains google.stanford.edu and z.stanford.edu. The domain google.com was registered on September 15, 1997. They formally incorporated their company, Google, on September 4, 1998 in their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park, California. Wojcicki eventually became an executive at Google and is now the CEO at YouTube. The first iteration of Google production servers was built with inexpensive hardware and was designed to be very fault-tolerant. Both Brin and Page had been against using advertising pop-ups in a search engine, or an \\"advertising funded search engines\\" model, and they wrote a research paper in 1998 on the topic while still students. They changed their minds early on and allowed simple text ads.Stross, Randall, Planet Google: One Company's Audacious Plan to Organize Everything We Know , New York : Free Press, September 2008. Cf. pp.3‚Äì4. By the end of 1998, Google had an index of about 60 million pages. Scott Rosenberg: Yes, there is a better search engine. While the portal sites fiddle, Google catches fire . Salon.com, 21 December 1998 The home page was still marked \\"BETA\\", but an article in Salon.com already argued that Google's search results were better than those of competitors like Hotbot or Excite.com, and praised it for being more technologically innovative than the overloaded portal sites (like Yahoo!, Excite.com, Lycos, Netscape's Netcenter, AOL.com, Go.com and MSN.com) which at that time, during the growing dot-com bubble, were seen as \\"the future of the Web\\", especially by stock market investors. Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google to Excite. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer. Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, talked the duo down to $750,000, but Bell still rejected it. In March 1999, the company moved into offices at 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, home to several other noted Silicon Valley technology startups.Fried, Ian. \\"A building blessed with tech success .\\" CNET.

After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the company leased a complex of buildings in Mountain View at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway from Silicon Graphics (SGI) in 2003. The company has remained at this location ever since, and the complex has since become known as the Googleplex (a play on the word googolplex, a number that is equal to 1 followed by a googol of zeros). In 2006, Google bought the property from SGI for US$319 million.Staff Writer. \\"Google to buy headquarters building from Silicon Graphics .\\" Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal.

The ads were text-based to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and click-throughs, with bidding starting at $.05 per click. This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered by Goto.com, an Idealab spin-off created by Bill Gross. When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company's pay-per-click and bidding patents. Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamed Yahoo! Search Marketing. The case was then settled out of court; Google agreed to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.Sullivan, Danny. \\"GoTo Going Strong .\\" The Search Engine Report.

While many of its dot-com rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue. Google's declared code of conduct is \\"Don't be evil\\", a phrase which they went so far as to include in their prospectus (aka \\"S-1\\") for their 2004 IPO, noting that \\"We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served‚Äîas shareholders and in all other ways‚Äîby a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains.\\" In February 2003, Google acquired Pyra Labs, owner of the Blogger website. The acquisition secured the company's competitive ability to use information gleaned from blog postings to improve the speed and relevance of articles contained in a companion product to the search engine Google News. In February 2004, Yahoo! dropped its partnership with Google, providing an independent search engine of its own. This cost Google some market share, yet Yahoo!'s move highlighted Google's own distinctiveness, and today the verb \\"to google\\" has entered a number of languages (first as a slang verb and now as a standard word), meaning \\"to perform a web search\\" (a possible indication of \\"Google\\" becoming a genericized trademark). The relationship between Google, Baidu, and Yahoo After the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization rose greatly and the stock price more than quadrupled. On August 19, 2004, the number of shares outstanding was 172.85 million while the \\"free float\\" was 19.60 million (which makes 89% held by insiders). Google has a dual-class stock structure in which each Class B share gets ten votes compared to each Class A share getting one. Page said in the prospectus that Google has \\"a dual-class structure that is biased toward stability and independence and that requires investors to bet on the team, especially Sergey and me.\\" In June 2005, Google was valued at nearly $52 billion, making it one of the world's biggest media companies by stock market value.\\"Google Shares Rise on New Price Target\\". Los Angeles Times. June 1, 2005. On August 18, 2005 (one year after the initial IPO), Google announced that it would sell 14,159,265 (another mathematical reference as œÄ ‚âà 3.14159265) more shares of its stock to raise money. The move would double Google's cash stockpile to $7 billion. Google said it would use the money for \\"acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets\\".Gonsalves, Antone. \\"Google Seeks Second Stock Offering .\\" Information Week.

One such example is the rivalry between Microsoft and Google.Dvorak, John C. \\"A Google-Microsoft War \\". PC Magazine. November 16, 2004. Microsoft had been touting its Bing search engine to counter Google's competitive position. Furthermore, the two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail (Gmail vs. Hotmail), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's Windows Live Local competes with Google Earth). In addition to an Internet Explorer replacement, Google designed its own Linux-based operating system called Chrome OS to directly compete with Microsoft Windows. There were also rumors of a Google web browser, fueled much by the fact that Google was the owner of the domain name \\"gbrowser.com\\". These were later proven when Google released Google Chrome. This corporate feud boiled over into the courts when Kai-Fu Lee, a former vice-president of Microsoft, quit Microsoft to work for Google. Microsoft sued to stop his move by citing Lee's non-compete contract (he had access to much sensitive information regarding Microsoft's plans in China). Google and Microsoft reached a settlement out of court on December 22, 2005, the terms of which are confidential.Vise, David A. \\"Microsoft, Google Both Claim Victory \\". The Washington Post. September 14, 2005, p. D05. Click fraud also became a growing problem for Google's business strategy.

Use of cookies  Although Google was already deriving the vast majority of its income from advertising at the time of its 2004 IPO, it did not use any HTTP cookie-based web tracking until during the 2007-2008 financial crisis on Google. By 2006, Google's Ad revenue was already facing signs of decline, as \\"a growing number of advertisers were refusing to buy display ads from Google.\\" The financial crisis pushed Google into a hiring freeze, and potentially to the edge of bankruptcy if ad revenue would keep declining. With a market cap of more than $100 billion, if Google was to go bankrupt, it would have serious implications on a stock market that was already seriously hit by the crisis (see United States bear market of 2007‚Äì2009). In 2007, Google agreed to buy DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, marking the start of its use of cookie-based tracking. Even with the purchase, Google only ended up with a 3% revenue in the second quarter of 2009, in the depth of the recession. The use of cookies have seriously implications to user privacy. Google previously separated the browsing habits collected from AD tracking from data collected by its other services by default. Google would remove this last layer of protection in 2016, making its tracking personally- identifiable. =2010s= In 2011, the company launched Google+, its fourth foray into social networking, following Google Buzz (launched 2010, retired in 2011), Google Friend Connect (launched 2008, retired by March 1, 2012), and Orkut (launched in 2004, retired in September 2014) As of November 2014, Google operated over 70 offices in more than 41 countries. In 2015, Google reorganized its interests as a holding company, Alphabet Inc., with Google as its leading subsidiary. Google continued to serve as the umbrella for Alphabet's Internet interests. On September 1, 2017, Google Inc. announced its plans of restructuring as a limited liability company, Google LLC, as a wholly owned subsidiary of XXVI Holdings, Inc., which is formed as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. to hold the equity of its other subsidiaries, including Google LLC and other bets. On 25 October 2018, The New York Times published the expos√©, \\"How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the ‚ÄòFather of Android‚Äô\\". The company subsequently announced that \\"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\\" for sexual misconduct. On 1 November 2018, Google employees staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints, including the golden parachute exit of former executive Andy Rubin; more than 20,000 employees and contractors participated. CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests.  Financing and initial public offering  The first funding for Google as a company was secured in August 1998 in the form of a US$100,000 contribution from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, given to a corporation which did not yet exist.Kopytoff, Verne, Fost, Dan. \\"For early Googlers, key word is $$$ \\".

On June 7, 1999, a round of equity funding totalling $25 million was announced, the major investors being rival venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital. While Google still needed more funding for their further expansion, Brin and Page were hesitant to take the company public, despite their financial issues. They were not ready to give up control over Google. Following the closing of the $25 million financing round, Sequoia encouraged Brin and Page to hire a CEO. Brin and Page ultimately acquiesced and hired Eric Schmidt as Google's first CEO in March 2001.Eppel, Thomas. Google. PowerPoint presentation. Management 10. University of California, Irvine.

Subsequent offers by the company to increase their salaries were turned down, primarily because their main compensation continues to come from owning stock in Google. Before 2004, Schmidt made $250,000 per year, and Page and Brin each received an annual salary of $150,000. There were concerns that Google's IPO would lead to changes in company culture. Reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires. As a reply to this concern, co-founders Brin and Page promised in a report to potential investors that the IPO would not change the company's culture. The company was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol GOOG. When Alphabet was created as Google's parent company, it retained Google's stock price history and ticker symbol.

(Barbara Bush), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under the ring name Taylor Vaughn, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Papaya and various independent promotions under different names. Early life Cathy grew up in a small town in New York before moving to Daytona Beach, where she worked for Hooters for 8 years. She also began modeling for posters and magazines before being approached by a close friend to work as a wrestling valet on the Independent circuit. She and her friend began training together and worked all over Florida. Professional wrestling career =Independent circuit= Kathy's most prominent time on the independent circuit was in the IWF as Cousin Brandy Mae where she was valet of Hillbilly Cuzin Ray and later The Tennessee Mountain Boys. Their characters were that of \\"hick\\" types and were popular with fans. =World Wrestling Federation (1999‚Äì2000)= Dingman began appearing in the WWF as an EMT during segments, including on SmackDown in October as she helped get a bear trap off of Road Dogg's leg. Dingman was also at Survivor Series when Tori was struck by X-Pac and when Stone Cold Steve Austin was run over by a car. She then appeared on the Thanksgiving 1999 edition of SmackDown, after the first ever Gravy Bowl match between Ivory and Jacqueline with Miss Kitty as the referee. Dingman came out to help the distressed Kitty and gave her the Heimlich maneuver to dislodge an object from her throat. Ivory went after the EMT, tore her top open and then threw her into the gravy. The following Monday on Monday Night Raw, Michael Cole introduced Dingman as Barbara Bush, whose friends call her \\"B.B.\\" She challenged the Women's Champ to an Evening Gown Match. Ivory came to the ring to run down the registered nurse, as Ivory accused her of just trying to win friends with the \\"perverts\\" in the audience. The two went at it, with Ivory tearing off BB's shirt. The next week Michael Cole was scheduled to interview B.B., but Ivory interrupted the interview saying what BB lacked for brains she made up for in bra size. At Armageddon 1999, B.B. was competing for the WWF Women's Championship but she was the second participant eliminated from the swimming pool match when both Ivory and Miss Kitty stripped her. On December 20 edition on Monday Night Raw, a \\"Holiday Topless Top-Rope Match\\" took place; B.B. was in the corner of Val Venis while Terri was in Hardcore Holly's corner. Unfortunately for B.B., Val was tossed twice in the contest, and Triple H was there to make sure that she disrobed as he blocked the crowd's view of B.B., making it so that he was the only person to see her topless. Three weeks later Jerry Lawler welcomed B.B. and the other participants of the Miss Royal Rumble Swimsuit Competition into the ring for an interview. B.B. told Jerry and the fans she was sure they wanted to see 'bigger'. The King made the joke during the contest that they call him \\"The Burger King\\" but B.B. has \\"the Double Whoppers\\". The contest ended with Mae Young being crowned Miss Royal Rumble. The following Monday, B.B. was one of the lumberjills in the first Snow Bunny match between The Kat and Harvey \\"Hervina\\" Wippleman. On February 10, Edge and Christian took on The Dudley Boyz. After the match, Bubba appeared to be injured, bringing out the EMTs. It was all a set-up to get B.B. through a table. This would be her final appearance before her release. =World Championship Wrestling= Cathy turned up as Papaya in WCW with red hair as the on-screen wife and valet of Kwee Wee. She appeared only twice before disappearing. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002)= In 2002, Dingman appeared in TNA as Taylor Vaughn. She took part in and won the Miss TNA Lingerie Battle Royal, also involving nine other ladies including Francine, Elektra, Shannon Spruill and Alexis Laree. After the match Francine then got back in the ring, and started to whip her with Ed Ferrera's belt. The following week they had a match in which Francine took a leather strap out of her boot and started to whip and choke Taylor with it. Referee Scott Armstrong grabbed it and took it away but Taylor grabbed it from the referee and proceeded to whip and choke Francine with it. The referee tried to stop her, but Taylor hit him too causing her to be disqualified. On the July 31 Don West brought out Miss TNA Taylor Vaughn. As he was about to talk to her, Bruce came out to the ring. Bruce said that he was listening to The Truth earlier and said that he too wants to be treated with respect and wanted to be Miss TNA and Taylor accepted his challenge by hitting him in the groin. Taylor was in control early, as Bruce was reeling from the shot down low until he came back and pinned her winning the Miss TNA crown. She tried to regain her crown the next week from Bruce in an Evening Gown Match but was unsuccessful after Bruce ripped off her evening gown.

The film is based on the television series of the same name that aired in the 1960s and starred Robert Culp and Bill Cosby. The film was released in the United States on November 1, 2002. It received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $60 million against its $70 million production budget. Plot At the Bureau of National Security headquarters, Special Agent Alex Scott is accosted by his rival, Carlos, before being briefed on his next mission. Scott is assigned to recover a stolen fighter, the \\"Switchblade,\\" plane sold to arms dealer Arnold Gundars. Gundars is sponsoring middleweight world boxing champion Kelly Robinson's next match and using the event to auction the plane. The agency has contacted Robinson and assigned him to be the civilian cover for Scott's mission. Scott and Robinson travel to Budapest, where Scott plans to penetrate Gundars' compound during a pre-fight party. Arriving in Budapest, Robinson is kidnapped. During the interrogation Scott bursts in, frees Robinson, and fights the kidnappers before revealing this was a test which Kelly passed by not divulging Scott's identity. At Gundars' party, Robinson replaces Gundars' pen with a duplicate fitted with a tracking device before confronting his European challenger in the party's boxing ring. Scott, posing as a member of Robinson's entourage, uses this as a diversion to enter Gundars' private office and hack his computer. Robinson arrives unexpectedly and trips an alarm. The two are forced to escape and manage to evade their pursuers by hiding in a sewer. After returning to base, Robinson helps Scott seduce Agent Rachel Wright by feeding him lines from the Marvin Gaye song \\"Sexual Healing\\". Scott succeeds, but is interrupted by movement on the pen tracking device. He tracks Gundars to a bathhouse, which Scott believes is a dead end. Robinson has a hunch that the plane is hidden in the building, leading the two into a fight with Gundars' men. Gundars speeds off in his car, with Wright in pursuit. Wright's car explodes and Scott blames Robinson for her death. The two engage in a public confrontation that leads to Robinson's arrest. Scott convinces the BNS that the operation can continue and tracks Gundars down again. Robinson reaches the arena just in time for his fight. Scott finds Gundars with terrorists, who are busy fitting the plane with a nuclear missile. Scott takes the men by surprise and forces them to surrender, before being disarmed by Agent Wright, who reveals she is a double agent. Wright tortures Scott for the Switchblade's activation codes. Scott activates the contact lens gadget, allowing Robinson to see the dilemma as he battles his opponent in the ring. Robinson gets knocked down for the first time in his career, but recovers, defeats his opponent, and departs for the bridge. Robinson sets off a firefight which kills many of the terrorists. After Carlos lands in a parachute, Robinson infers that Carlos is also corrupt. When Carlos provokes Kelly, he knocks him out, scattering the terrorists for them to take cover. Robinson takes out the remaining terrorists, while their leader, Zhu Tam, and Gundars are both killed by Wright. After the bomb on the plane is destroyed, Robinson tells Rachel to put the gun down. Wright makes up a lie that the BNS suspected that Carlos was corrupt and says that they pretended to team up with Carlos so they can catch him and uses this to convince the others that she is innocent. The confusion leads to a fight between Scott and Carlos, allowing Wright to escape with Gundars' briefcase. Scott and Robinson attempt to fly the Switchblade away, but it crashes into the river. While in the water, Robinson discovers the nuclear weapon. Scott realizes the mission is a success after all, and Robinson remarks that he will be recognized as a hero. Later in Monte Carlo, Scott and Robinson track down Agent Wright and place her under arrest. Scott turns up a copy of USA Today and sees a picture of Carlos in a parade with President Bush. Robinson takes this news hard, and refuses to accompany Scott to BNS headquarters for a mission debrief. Scott tells Robinson the agency has perfected a jelly-like substance that will allow its wearer to float through the air. Robinson happily agrees to go, and Scott tells another agent to retrieve some jars of jelly and two parachutes.

Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 16% of 134 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Insipid and mirthless, I Spy bares little resemblance to the TV series that inspired it.\\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, \\"This is a remake by the numbers, linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie.\\" The film was nominated for three Razzie Awards: Worst Remake, Worst Actor for Eddie Murphy, and Worst Screen Couple for Murphy and Owen Wilson.

The musical played a \\"discreet and well- reviewed test run at Buffalo's Studio Arena Theatre in fall 2005\\". The musical contains 38 of Johnny Cash's songs, such as \\"Country Boy,\\" \\"A Thing Called Love,\\" \\"Five Feet High and Rising,\\" \\"Daddy Sang Bass,\\" \\"Ring of Fire,\\" \\"I Walk the Line,\\" \\"I've Been Everywhere,\\" \\"The Man in Black\\" and \\"Hurt.\\" The musical opened on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on March 12, 2006. The show has six principal performers paired as three couples: young, middle-aged and older. The cast featured Beth Malone and Jarrod Emick; Lari White and Jeb Brown; and Jason Edwards and Cass Morgan. Maltby said of the concept: \\"The couples progress through life. If you know Johnny Cash's story you can see the contours of his biography in the show. But it's not only his story. A lot of people have said to me that they saw their own life in the show, which I think is true, too.\\" Due to mixed reviews and critical reception, as well as low ticket sales, the musical closed on April 30, 2006 after 57 performances and 38 previews. The musical was produced at the Charlottetown Festival, Prince Edward Island, in June 2012. A \\"reconceived\\" version of the musical was presented at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in March 2013, created and directed by Maltby. This version had five cast members, including Eddie Clendening. Critical response Ben Brantley, in his review for the New York Times, wrote: \\"Though Mr. Cash,...is not himself a character in this latest entry in the jukebox musical sweepstakes of Broadway, his spirit is invoked as a friendly ghost with dimples and a twinkling disposition. In other words, Ring of Fire, which opened last night at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, has little to do with the dark, troubled and excitingly dangerous presence that most people remember as Johnny Cash... In form, Ring of Fire hovers between the usual singalong and storybook styles. Using songs recorded by Mr. Cash between 1955 and 2002 (many of them written by other composers), the show follows a sort of ages-of-man path from green country-boy idealism into the sloughs of a hard-living musician's disillusionment and on up to the mountains of spiritual redemption... Certainly, I was aware of missing someone as I was watching Ring of Fire. Too bad that person happened to be Johnny Cash.\\" Many felt the failure was due to the show being booked into a theatre that was too large for the intimacy of the show.
