Life  Born in Paris, Beaulieu was the son of an artillery officer and descendant of a rich cloth merchant family based in Niort. He adopted the name Beaulieu after the Beaulieu estate bought by his grandfather in 1761. Beaulieu had violin lessons with a musician named Alliaume, a student of Isidore Bertheaume (about 1751–1802) and from 1803 with Rodolphe Kreutzer. Since 1805 he had composition lessons with Angelo Maria Benincori (1779–1821), later with Abbé Nicolas Roze. From 1809 he attended the class of Étienne-Nicolas Méhul at the Conservatoire de Paris. In 1811, he won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome with the cantata Héro et Léandre after a libretto by Jacques Bins de Saint-Victor. However, he renounced his stay in Rome and settled with his wife Francoise Caroline Rouget de Gourcez in Niort, where her father had been mayor until the French Revolution. Nevertheless, he fulfilled his obligations as a winner of the Prix de Rome and sent several church music pieces to the Académie des Beaux-Arts. After the death of his teacher Méhul, he composed a Requiem in 1819, which was also performed in 1851 in memory of Kreutzer and in 1863 for his own funeral. In 1827, he founded a \\"Société Philharmonique\\" in Niort, from which the \\"Association musicale de l'Ouest\\" was born in collaboration with the violinist and conductor Jules Norès. This was the first symphonic association in the region to organise concerts in Niort, La Rochelle, Angoulème, Rochefort, Poitiers and Limoges and to organise an annual musical congress. The society was active until 1879 and led among other things Mendelssohns' oratorios Paulus and Elias, Händels Alexander's Feast, Ludwig Wilhelm Maurers Symphonie concertante and Antonin Reicha's wind quintets. In 1863 Beaulieu founded the Fondation Beaulieu in Paris, which he endowed by will with a capital of 100,000 francs. The foundation had a great influence on musical life in Paris until the First World War. Its chairmen were Ambroise Thomas (bis 1895), Henri Colmet-Daage (1896), Théodore Dubois (1897–1910) and Camille Saint-Saëns, the musical directors were Adolphe Deloffre (1864–73), Guillot de Sainbris (1874–87), Jules Danbé (1888–1905), Georges Marty (1905–08) and Gabriel Pierné. Vocal music was at the centre of Beaulieu's compositional work. In addition to operas, cantatas and lyrical scenes, he composed secular and religious choral works as well as songs and romances with different accompaniments and two string quartets. Interested in public life in his city, Beaulieu was a member of the city council of Niort from 1840 until his death in 1863.Extensive curriculum vitae and catalogue of works on the website Musica et Memoria  Works  *Alcyone, Scène dramatique (text by Antoine- Vincent Arnault), 1808 *Céphale, Kantate (text by Jean-Baptiste Rousseau), 1808 *Circé, Kantate, (text by J.

Having grown up in Yakutsk, she has an empathy with the people living in the far north and the difficult living conditions they experience, and several of her photographic projects have involved them. The National Geographic has funded her to photograph the people and economic changes on Russia's northern coast. Early life and education Arbugaeva was born in Tiksi, a small port town of the Sakha Republic on the Arctic Sea, near the mouth of the Lena River. As part of the Soviet Union, Tiksi supported military airfields and became the world's most northern settlement with over 5000 people. Her memories of the place include pink mountains, whiteout snowstorms in which she lost all sense of place, fields of snow colored green or gold by the surrounding light, and auroras in the endless night of winter. One of her childhood heroes was explorer Jacques Cousteau. At the age of eight, and at the fall of the Soviet Union, she and her family moved to Yakutsk, \\"the coldest city on earth\\" and a place that she found much less visually appealing. She studied management in Moscow before moving to New York City. There, she studied photography at the International Center of Photography, graduating in 2009. 19 years after moving from her hometown, Arbugaeva decided to move back to Tiksi because she could no longer remember anything from the town. These memories had faded so much to the point where they seemed unreal. Photography Arbugaeva's photographic method involves living with her subjects on a long enough term to become friends with them and for them to relax in front of her camera. For instance, in one of her projects she traveled with Siberian hunters for the tusks of mammoths, newly exposed by global warming. She won the trust of the hunters by stitching up the injured hand of the head of the group. She often works without a camera, scouting locations that she returns to frequently until the lighting and inspiration combine to give her a photo. In 2010 Arbugaeva returned to Tiksi, now becoming a ghost town, on a personal visit to compare it to her memories, but left the town with only one photo she liked, of a teenage girl playing on the seashore. Inspired by the photo, she traveled back to Tiksi in 2011 to meet the girl and her family and to document their daily life, overlain with her own memories. Despite the decline of the town and the difficult life there (which drove her host family to plan their own departure), her photos in this project are \\"bright and whimsical, their compositions and vivid colours redolent of the books she read there as a child\\". Arbugaeva learned of the weather stations of northern Russia in a dog sledding incident, when she and her father had to take shelter from bad weather at one of the stations. In her project \\"Weather Man\\", she took a two- month passage on an icebreaker to 22 of the stations, including the station at Khodovarikha, where she met meteorologist Vyacheslav (Slava) Korotki. The portrait taken of Vyacheslav Korotki is an intimate story of an individualistic man, who is facing the fading winter of the Arctic. In early 2014, she returned to Khodovarikha by helicopter for a two-and-a-half-week visit and photography session with Korotki. Based on this work, a much darker series of photos than the ones from Tiksi, she published a profile of Korotki in The New Yorker. Arbugaeva's other photography projects have included nomadic Yakut reindeer herders in Sakha, and \\"Amani\\", a sequence of fictionalized images set on an abandoned anthropological research station on a former German coffee plantation in Tanzania. Recognition Arbugaeva is the 2013 winner of Leica's Oskar Barnack Award for her work in Tiksi, for which she also received a Magnum Foundation International Emergency Fund grant in 2012. In 2018, National Geographic named her as one of their four inaugural Media Innovation Fellows, funding her to photograph the people and economic changes on Russia's northern coast.

Tehreem ( Sarwat Gilani) is brimming with life and we can't see her discouraged variant, which proceeded all through the scene.

Likewise, she educated her mom about Zain and Shafaq's preferring and youth commitment which instantly got objected in light of the fact that her mom is additionally a piece of the haveli and they never found out about this artificial relationship.

War declarations Romania declared war on the British Empire on 6 December 1941 and on the United States on 12 December. The British returned the war declaration that December, however the Americans only did so in the summer of 1942. Two American allies, Nicaragua and Haiti, declared war on Romania on 19 and 24 December respectively. Romania promptly returned these declarations. Four British allies also declared war on Romania: Canada (7 December), New Zealand (7 December), Australia (8 December), and South Africa (9 December). However, Romania never returned these declarations (likely because the four countries were seen as British subjects by the Romanian leadership).Dr Erik Goldstein, Routledge, 2005, Wars and Peace Treaties: 1816 to 1991, pp. 216-218 Aerial operations Having declared war on Romania on 5 June 1942,Martin Folly, Niall Palmer, Scarecrow Press, 2010, The A to Z of U.S. Diplomacy from World War I through World War II, p. 86 the first attack on Romanian territory was conducted by the United States Army Air Forces on 12 June. Ten B-24 Liberators attacked the Romanian oil refineries at Ploiești, two attacked unidentified targets and one attacked the port of Constanța. The damage inflicted was negligible and none of the 13 aircraft were lost.Eric Hammel, Pacifica Military History, 2010, Air War Europa: Chronology: America's Air War Against Germany In Europe and North Africa, 1942 - 1945, p. 48 The second American attack took place over a year later, on 1 August 1943. Code-named Operation Tidal Wave, it consisted in a large-scale air raid over the Romanian oil refineries at Ploiești by 178 unescorted Liberators. Over 50 of the American bombers were shot down by the German and Romanian defenses, the Royal Romanian Air Force claiming 20 American aircraft while losing only 2 fighters.Spencer C.

The American aircraft were joined by the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force. The campaign was called off on 19 August 1944. It ultimately proved to be an unsuccessful endeavour, as the Anglo-Americans failed to obliterate Ploiești. In just over a year, from Operation Tidal Wave until the 1944 bombing campaign was called off, the Royal Romanian Air Force, aided by Romanian artillery, shot down 259 Anglo-American aircraft (223 bombers and 36 fighters). Romania's German ally shot down 66 more Anglo-American aircraft. In total, Anglo- Americans casualties amounted to 1,706 KIA and 1,123 POWs. Romanian aircraft losses were much lower, amounting to 80 fighters shot down. It is not known how many Romanian aircrew were killed, but one of them was Alexandru Șerbănescu, Romania's second best flying ace (47 kills, shot down on 18 August).

Extra bread was sold on to middle men or 'hucksters' who would sell it in the streets. Since the price of bread was fixed by law the huckster would make a profit by selling on the extra 13th loaf which was the vantage loaf.

The park was Grade II listed with Historic England in 1986. History The site on which the park lays was owned by the Earl of Stamford in 1668 and was part of a deer park. During the industrial revolution the population of the area was in poor health and began to demand a park to enjoy on their day off. In 1856 a letter was sent to the Ashton Reporter requesting the cotton mill workers raise money for a park. Fundraising began and in 1872 Highfield House and grounds was purchased, the Earl donated adjacent land and Stamford Park was opened officially on 12 July 1873. The Lord and Lady Stamford arrived for the opening and the towns of Ashton, Stalybridge and Dukinfield were decorated out in bunting and flags.

It was built from 1853 to 1858 for Edward Wollstonecraft. It is also known as St. Leonard's Cottage. The property is owned by North Sydney Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Edward Wollstonecraft arrived in the area and took possession of Portion 323 in September 1819, which was eventually granted to him on 30 June 1825. Don Bank was built on part of of Portion 323 A pioneer of shipping and whaling rather than a farmer, Wollstonecraft built Crows Nest Cottage on his land (now the site of the present Presbyterian Church in Shirley Road). Don Bank was not built between 1820 and 1830 as was previously assumed but recent research based on survey plans and title investigation conclusively establish that it was built no earlier than July 1853 and was extended in November 1854 when it is referred to by description in a contemporary newspaper advertisement for the sale of land and property on the North Shore by Mrs. Charlotte Carr. In 1853 William Carr, a solicitor purchased the site. Before completion of that sale, Don Bank was built as the intended residence of his widow, Charlotte Carr. It was then known as St. Leonard's Cottage and described as a four roomed home in an unsuccessful advertisement offering it for sale in November 1854. In 1853 it was known as St Leonard's Cottage.City Plan Services, 2014, 1-4 Room 6 (dining room), 1 and 7 (kitchen) were constructed between 1856 and 1858.City Plan Services, 2014, 4  Description  =Site and setting, front garden= Don Bank is now surrounded by high rise office buildings. Its primary frontage is (north-east) to Napier Street, with a secondary (rear) entrance from Oak Street to the west. The building sits north of (i.e. its southern boundary abuts) a public garden and pathway which forms a pleasant green setting to it and allows pedestrian access between Npaier Street and Wheeler Lane. Neighbouring Victorian Georgian Revival style single storey identical houes are arranged in symmetrical pairs directly opposite Don Bank (at 1-7 Napier Street) forming a strong visual and contextual relationship with it. Along with the timber- fenced Victorian garden on the Napier Street frontage, Don Bank forms an oasis amongst high rise commercial buildings. Traffic along Napier Street is directed to the Pacific Highway to its east, a major road on North Sydney central business district. Napier Street is a one-way street parallel to the highway. The area west of Don Bank, along Oak Street displays Victorian Georgian Revival stingle storey houes with skillion verandahs (2-10 Oak Street). This along with the residential character of Oak Street retains the context of Don Bank as a former house.City Plan Services, 2014, 2 When built in 1853-4 Don Bank would have enjoyed sweeping views across (east) to Neutral Bay.City Plan Services, 2014, 3 Don Bank's front garden is broadly a sweep of grass with various trees and shrubs dotting and edging or framing it. An array of small trees line its front fence and more along with shrubs are nearer the house which is set well back from the fence and up a small slope. An Illawarra flame tree (Brachychiton acerifolius) is near the front gate. Two Lord Howe Island palms (Kentia fosteriana) are along the front path uphill. Other trees are to the house's northern side. Old-fashioned perennials such as flowering sages (Salvia sp./cv.), bushes such as Cape leadwort or plumbago (P.capensis) grow along its front fence. Main trees comprise Californian desert fan palm (Washingtonia robusta), coastal banksia (B.integrifolia) - a large old specimen to the north, crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica) and others.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 11/5/2016 =House= Don Bank, 2018 A single storey Victorian Georgian Revival style cottage of vertical fitted slab construction with lath and plaster interior walls and red cedar joinery, a wide front door with French doors opening onto a verandah across the front. The original shingle roof has been replaced with corrugated iron. The verandah has very good timber trelllage work of a type now rare. The cottage is of vernacular slab construction comprising a double-pile house with gabled ends and a verandah runs the length of its front and another across most of its rear elevation. It displays many features of the Colonial Regency style, including a symmetrical facade, four-room plan with a double pitched roof and a central valley, flat timber posts and decorative fascia boards. Its principal elevation is four-rooms wide, two rooms flanking either side of a central hall. Each room has a separate access to the front verandah in the form of French doors with full-height shutters. The detailing is minimal presenting twin post and latticed columns supporting the verandah roof and just above, it is edged with a scalloped fascia board (the bargeboard at the rear and gabled ends is also scalloped). The verandah with timber floorboards extends the full length of the front elevation. The roof has been re-shingled in the recent past with she-oak (Casuarina sp.). It is believed to be the second time the roof has been re-shingled since its post-1980 restoration. Verandah, 2018 The interior maintains its original room configuration (two rooms on either side of the central hall) with additional rooms added along the north–south axis and a kitchen wing attached perpendicular to the northernmost Room 6 (dining room). The central hall connects front and rear verandahs giving access to Rooms 2–5. It retains an original boarded ceiling, original wall boards along Room 3 and 4 walls. Calico cloth lines walls outside Rooms 2 and 5, which was created and hung as an interpretive element during 1980 restoration. It is estimated that Rooms 2–4 in the central core still retain up to 80% of their original fabric and are in good condition. The walls and ceiling of Room 2 date to the 1980s. Room 6 (dining room), 1 and 7 (Kitchen) were constructed between 1856 and 1858 and refurbished during the 1980 restoration. This refurbishment included re-plastering of walls (in certain places), installing plumbing and constructing caretakers' quarters (toilet and kitchen at the south-west corner of the cottage). A box gutter runs along the north–south axis of the cottage. Building fabric sitting under this has been stained in several places. Room 2 (Morning Room, now the Guides' room) has the most staining to its calico-lined ceiling and walls. Differing widths and species of timber floorboards in each room reveal something of the age and progression of construction within individual rooms. During the 1980s restorations, new timber floor was laid where deterioration and decay were substantial. = Modifications and dates = 2014: the building has retained its original central core layout in spite of several additions and post-1980 restoration.

His extensive collection featured works by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Le Corbusier, Olle Bærtling, Sam Francis, Mark Tobey, Christo, Lucio Fontana, Tadeusz Kantor, Enrico Baj, Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle. Key works in the collection included the two versions of Matisse's Apollo (1953), Picasso's Nude in a rocking chair (1956) and Chagall's Les mariés sous le baldaquin (1949).  Life  = Early life and career = Theodor Ahrenberg, son of Swedish shipping magnate and owner of Th. Ahrenberg Rederi (Th. Ahrenberg Shipping Co.) Ossian Ahrenberg and his wife Naëma Ahrenberg (born Wijkander), spent his youth in Gothenburg, centred at the family home at Viktor Rydbergsgatan 14. Following moderate academic performance at school, Ahrenberg was withdrawn from Högre Samskola by his father, and began working in shipping in Stettin, Hamburg and Newcastle. Ahrenberg later described this training as important preparation for his career as a collector: “You had to be far-sighted, careful and daring, all at the same time ... and you simply had to succeed. That was the charm of shipping, and in my case, it could be said that such speculative tendencies and audacity ... left their mark on me, even in the new world into which I would enter, that of art.Theodor Ahrenberg, Jag har ju ändå en Picasso.Memoarer av Teto Ahrenberg, utmanaren, konstsamlaren, mecenaten, Ulla Ahrenberg and Folke Edwards (eds.), Walhström & Widstrand,Stockholm, 1993, p. 29 In 1939–40 Ahrenberg fought as a volunteer in the Swedish forces against Finland in the Winter War against Russia, and was highly decorated. Returning to Gothenburg in 1941 and following the decline of Th. Ahrenberg Shipping Co., Ahrenberg moved to Stockholm to further his career. He first worked inventorying barrels for Nynäs Petroleum, then moved to a more senior position at the Trade and Industry Commission, before finally commencing an executive managerial role at the Gas and Coke Economic Federation (GOKEF). = Collecting beginnings = On business trips throughout Europe for GOKEF beginning in the late 1940s, Ahrenberg discovered his passion for modern art and began collecting, with an initial focus on graphic prints including those of Picasso. In time he amassed one of the most important and qualitative private European collections of twentieth-century Western art. From the early 1950s Agnes Widlund (1910–2005), founder and director of Gallery Samlaren at Birger Jarlsgatan 1 in Stockholm, began advising Ahrenberg on his collection. Under Widlund's guidance the collection expanded to include works by Matisse, Chagall, Le Corbusier, Georges Braque and Georges Rouault. Widlund arranged visits by Ahrenberg to artists in their studios including Picasso, Matisse, Chagall and Le Corbusier, beginning Ahrenberg's lifelong passion for meeting the artists whose work he collected and purchasing from them directly. = Relationship with Swedish art establishment = Ahrenberg became a central figure in Swedish and European art circles, and held positions including secretary of the Tessin Society and was a board member of art associations including Friends of Nationalmuseum, Friends of Moderna Museet, and Aspect. He dedicated himself to improving conditions for art students and young artists, culminating in his controversial speech “The Poverty of Art in the Welfare State” made at Aspect's public meeting at Stockholm's Academy of Fine Arts on 3 September 1959. In it he called for more state support for artists and art institutions, and criticized then director of Stockholm's Nationalmuseum Carl Nordenfalk (1907–92) for his apprehensive approach to funding. Ahrenberg thus conflicted with Sweden's conservative art institutions, particularly in areas of finance. = Ahrenberg Museum by Le Corbusier = Such disputes, above all with Nordenfalk who rejected Ahrenberg's proposals of December 1959 that the collection be deposited at Nationalmuseum or another Swedish institution, led Ahrenberg to the decision to build his own exhibition space in Stockholm, known as the Palais Ahrenberg or Ahrenberg Museum. In 1961 Le Corbusier, with whom Ahrenberg was on close terms, agreed to design the museum; the plans were presented publicly in 1962.Fondation Le Corbusier: Pavillon d'exposition, palais Ahrenberg, Stockholm, Sweden, 1962, accessed on 6 September 2018 Le Corbusier took his inspiration from a design which he had made two years previously for a similar project in Tokyo and which was ultimately executed in 1964 for the Heidi Weber Museum in Zurich, also known as the “Centre Le Corbusier”. A model of the Ahrenberg Museum, based on Le Corbusier's original plans, has been housed there since 2005.The model (1.50 x 1.80 m / 1:20) was made at RWTH Aachen University under the supervision of Professor Rudolf Bertig. = Loss of collection and relocation to Switzerland = The Ahrenberg Museum was, however, never built, as the Swedish state prosecuted Ahrenberg, controversially confiscated the collection, and sold it in an enforced series of auctions beginning in 1963. Ahrenberg and his wife Ulla (born Ulla Frisell in 1931) and their four children subsequently settled at the house Le Rocher in Chexbres, Switzerland, above the north bank of Lake Geneva, where he began to rebuild the collection. Specifically he established an atelier at Le Rocher where he invited a series of artists of the post-war European avant-garde to live and work, often for several months at a time. Ahrenberg died on 21 June 1989 at the age of 77 in Vevey.  The first collection  Ahrenberg's first collection was at the time one of the most extensive private collections of twentieth-century Western art, comprising around 1,000 works that presented a cross-section of modernism.Tilo Richter: Dabei sein in der Küche der Kunst – Theodor Ahrenberg im Porträt in the FAS from 21 April 2011. Ahrenberg acquired works by both famous and relatively renowned artists including Henri Matisse (1869–1954), Pablo Picasso (1881–1973), Georges Braque (1882–1963), Marc Chagall (1887–1985), Le Corbusier (1887–1965), Fernand Léger, (1881–1955), Alberto Giacometti, (1901–66), Henry Moore (1898–1986), Mark Tobey (1890–1976), among other, non-established figures. According to Ulla Ahrenberg the collection at its height featured alone hundreds of works by Picasso and nearly all of Matisse's sculptures.Tilo Richter: Dabei sein in der Küche der Kunst – Theodor Ahrenberg im Porträt in the FAS from 21 April 2011.Wolfgang Büscher: Dann nahmen sie Teto mit – Wie Picassos Freund seine weltberühmte Sammlung verlor in Blau (Kunstmagazin der Welt), pp. 48–55, May/June 2015. Ahrenberg also passionately supported his sometimes controversial fellow Swedish artists, including Carl Kylberg, Olle Bærtling, Einar Hylander, Öyvind Fahlström, Richard Mortensen, Robert Jacobsen and Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd. Another focus was artists from Eastern Europe whose practice was then limited by restrictive state policies behind the Iron Curtain, in particular Tadeusz Kantor (1915–90). Ahrenberg's outspoken support for such artists at this time only increased the tension between himself and the conservative art establishment.Carin Ståhlberg: Fel man på fel plats vid fel tid (Wrong Man at the Wrong Place at the Wrong Time ) in Dagens Nyheter, 19 June 1993. The value of the collection today has been estimated at over a billion Euros.  The second collection  Ahrenberg's second collection comprised mainly works by artists who were guests at the Le Rocher atelier. These were primarily friends and included Sam Francis, Christo, Lucio Fontana, Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint Phalle, Arman, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Tobey, Enrico Baj, Yaacov Agam and Heinrich Richter. The character of the second collection stands in stark contrast to that of the first, which had provided an overview of modernism through Ahrenberg's choices. In art critic Folke Edward's words the new collection “showed a playful, experimental and personal character; it is a subjective and spontaneous, not shaped by a desire to present an objective or qualitative overview.” In time Ahrenberg's second collection grew to encompass around 6,000 objects, among them curiosities and experimental works such as the ceramics (including plates, bowls, piggy banks and ashtrays) and wine labels – all idiosyncratically and often whimsically decorated by artists visiting Le Rocher, including Albert Chubac, Lars Gynning, Gérard “Imof” Imhof, Julio Zapata, Roberto Crippa and Ricci Riggenbach. After Theodor Ahrenberg's death in 1989, Ulla Ahrenberg has continued her role as custodian and archivist of the collection. Their son Staffan Ahrenberg, a successful Hollywood producer and entrepreneur, continues his father's collecting tradition; his own collection includes contemporary American and European art, such as that of Richard Serra, Robert Longo, Wolfgang Tillmans, Cildo Meireles, Jenny Holzer, Martin Kippenberger and Adrián Villar Rojas. In October 2012 Staffan Ahrenberg relaunched the renowned French art and literature journal Cahiers d'art. In September 2018 the first comprehensive monograph of Theodor Ahrenberg's life and collections was published in English as Living with Picasso, Matisse and Christo: Theodor Ahrenberg and His Collections by Thames & Hudson, London; and in Swedish as Ett liv med Matisse, Picasso och Christo – Theodor Ahrenberg och hans samlingar by Arvinius + Orfeus Publishing, Stockholm.

Biography  Little is known about Gridin's early life. It is known that he was born in a very respected in the city family. His father was the head of the workshop at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, and Gridin was a student at the Magnitogorsk State Technical University, was married, and had a six-month-old daughter. The first murder Gridin committed was on July 31, 1989, killing 16-year-old Zhana Terenchuk in the porch of her house. Then there were three unsuccessful attacks on girls, one of them giving a detailed description of the \\"Lifter\\". A month later he again committed two murders at once (Danzili Usmanova and Lyudmila Pozdnyakova). On the site of one of the murders he left a fingerprint. On November 25, 1989, Gridin tried to make another attack, but the girl gave him serious resistance, and he ran in fear, dropping his hat and glasses. It was because of these signs that he was soon detained, since it -20 °C on the street, and Gridin stood out too much from the crowd. In addition, at the time of his arrest a knife was taken away from him. The Gridin case caused a wide resonance in society. The people were furious and demanded the public execution of the murderer. The trial began in the fall of 1990 and was accompanied by popular unrest: people demanded that the criminal be sentenced to the most severe sentence. On October 3, 1990, the Chelyabinsk Regional Court sentenced Gridin to death; but in December 1993 the death penalty was replaced by life imprisonment, and he was imprisoned on Ognenny Ostrov in the Vologda Oblast. In 2000, Gridin appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which admitted that there were violations in his case. However, the Russian leadership refused to release him, citing the fact that after his arrest attacks on women ceased. In 2013, the crew of the TV program \\"Investigation conducted...\\" visited Dmitry Gridin in the colony in Vologda Oblast. In the interview, he announced his intention to apply for parole in 2014, 25 years after his arrest. In 2014, he tried to challenge the Presidential Decree on pardon, but the application was refused. Gridin challenged the refusal, but the Supreme Court of Russia left court ruling unchanged. In the same year, Gridin, after 25 years of imprisonment, filed a motion on the UDO, but the Belozersky District Court issued a decision to refuse parole. Three years later, in the summer of 2017, Gridin filed a motion for the second time, but the court again refused him, after which Gridin filed an appeal with the Vologoda Regional Court against the Belozersky Court's decision, but the appeal was rejected.

It was designed by William Tunks, Mayor and built during 1838. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 July 2015.  History  =Phase 1: Reserve alienation, 1838-1867= The site for St Leonards Park was first identified and then gazetted when the original township of St Leonards was laid out in 1838. During this early phase, no development was undertaken other than a track which crossed diagonally across the park. A tributary of Willoughby Falls Creek ran across the site in the current location of the Music Shell and there was also a swamp near the existing Fig Tree Lane. =Phase 2: Park established, 1867- 1900s= William Tunks, the first mayor of the newly created township of St Leonards, made it his first duty to have the public reserve dedicated as a public park in 1867 as a centrepiece for the new municipality. The first portion of land was dedicated in 1867 and set aside for public recreation and cricket, with the second section, not dedicated until 1869. The original cricket ground, now known as North Sydney Oval, was dedicated and the first pitch laid on 6 December 1867, making it one of the oldest continuously used cricket pitches in Australia. The first pavilion for spectators was constructed in 1879 on the south-western side of the oval and then replaced in 1909. This was further replaced in 1929 with the current Duncan Thompson Stand on the north western side of the oval. An Act of Parliament of New South Wales in 1879 gave the land its name St Leonards Park. Mayor Tunks was very interested in the development of St Leonards Park and took a personal interest in its construction, attending to the location of pathways, the plantings of shrubs and trees, some even cultivated from his own garden. Local residents raised funds in 1873 for a perimeter fence and for further plantings of pines, camphor laurels and figs. The design was influenced by the English Public Parks Movement and Charles Moore, the Director of the Botanical Gardens, Sydney, as he promoted the use of Moreton Bay and Port Jackson figs in many parks across Sydney. The large fig trees in the formal avenue of Fig Tree Lane were most possibly planted at this time and were influenced by the middle- class practice of the leisurely promenade. In 1883, Tunks suffered a fatal fall in the park. His memory is however, perpetuated on a Carrara marble fountain erected in his honour in 1885 with funds raised by the public. The fountain is still present today to the north of the War Memorial and is known as the Tunks Memorial Fountain. Under the provisions of a by-law of the Public Parks Act of April 1884, North Sydney Council was given status as Trustee for St Leonards Park. In 1885, a number of citizens proposed that Council, as Trustee, grant space for the playing of bowls. The by-laws and the Local Government of New South Wales and Crown Lands Acts however, did not allow Council to lease parkland, only allowing Council to enter into renewable occupancy agreements. By May 1887 an area for a bowling green was gazetted with rules established by the Public Parks Branch of the Department of Mines (then the Department responsible for public parks) ensuring free access to the public when no sport was being played. The first annual general meeting was held in 1888, naming the club the St Leonards Bowling Club with the then Mayor of St Leonards, Captain Jenkins, as the first chairman. The bowling club obtained a lease over the crown land in 1888.NSW LEC 2016/170886 In 1894, the Acting Under Secretary of Lands approved two areas for the playing of cricket and football totalling as well as a five-year licence for over for a bowling club. A plan was created showing the outline of each area. The current Bon Andrews Oval is in the location of the space originally known as the \\"Football Ground\\" although the oval has been used for both cricket and football. By 1886, the park was connected to the ferry terminal at Milsons Point by the tramway. The Jubilee Fountain was erected in 1897 to the north-east of the existing bowling club, in honour of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. This fountain, however, was subsequently re-located to Civic Park between Stanton Library and the North Sydney Council Chambers in 1982. The North Sydney Sewer VentSHR No 1641 was constructed by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage between 1891 and 1899. Originally designed to vent the reticulation system that took waste water from North Sydney and Mosman, it was located within St Leonards Park until it was separated by the construction of the Warringah Expressway. =Phase 3: Early Twentieth Century development, 1900-1930= Australia's first outdoor cinema commenced operation at St Leonards Park in 1909 by opticians Osbourne & Jerdan. The screening of movies continue in 2014 by Sunset Cinemas after e being operated by Starlight Cinemas for the previous decade. After the First World War, North Sydney Council established a War Memorial Committee to raise funds and to identify a site for a memorial to commemorate the sacrifice made by the armed services. The site at the crest of Ridge St and the northern end of Walker St was chosen, along the park's central axis in direct alignment with the Tunks Memorial Fountain. The design, by Frank Thorp, a student working a Peddle Thorp and Walker, was chosen after a design competition and approved by the Public Monuments Advisory Board. The foundation stone was laid in 1924 for an Art Deco style cenotaph made of Bowral trachyte and was unveiled in 1926. At the time of construction, it was visible from parts of Sydney Harbour and was the largest and most imposing war memorial in Sydney. In 1921, the World War I German Field Gun allotted by the State War Trophy Committee was mounted on a pedestal in the north-west corner of St Leonards Park and unveiled by Major-General Sir Granville Ryrie. Two tennis courts were constructed prior to 1930, on the site of the current playground. In 1904, the original grandstand at North Sydney Oval was replaced with a more substantial structure and in 1909 a low picket fence was constructed to enclose the oval after an agreement was reached between North Sydney Council, the NSW Rugby league football and Osbourne & Jerdan, the firm that conducted open-air picture shows on the Oval. By 1924, Council awarded a prize to Mr F G Leslie Allen of Martin Place for the design of a brick grandstand. Now known as the Duncan Thompson Stand, it was the largest suburban grandstand in NSW at the time of its construction, seating 772 spectators. It was officially opened in 1928. =Phase 4: Inter-war and early post-war years, 1930s-1960s= During the early 1930s, St Leonards Park was a site for various government established work projects to create jobs. A Works Depot was constructed at this time near North Sydney Oval and rusticated stone work fences with a rough concrete finish were constructed. A playground was established on the original tennis court site during the 1930s and included rows of swings and climbing equipment. By the 1940s, the park's activities had been extended to included dance and drama programmes, as well as sporting events. The playground was staffed by the Leadership Training College where Mr Edgar Herbert was the principal, a leading Australian authority on physical training and children's development. The area was to become a model community centre but was never achieved by Herbert, due to the advent of World War II and the death of Herbert in 1948. Ornamental gardens were planted near Miller Street with the name St Leonards Park formed by planted garden beds. World War II also resulted in the construction of slit air raid trenches in a zig-zag pattern across the northern area of the park as well as near the War Memorial. These were later in-filled in 1944. A stone gazebo, constructed for the \\"Old Age and Invalid Pensioners\\" was constructed with funding from the Department of Local Government and Housing using rock faced stone and a terracotta tile roof. In 1948 the Music Shell, designed by Peddle Thorp and Walker was completed and officially opened on 13 November by the Honorable Clive R Evatt, Minister for Housing with an audience of 4000 watching to a performance by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the North Shore Choral Society. A brick wall was constructed around North Sydney Oval during 1936, resulting in the removal of a double avenue of Moreton Bay figs along the Miller St frontage. This wall was to enclose the oval and to allow concrete terrace style seating for 1200 people. The Cunningham Pavilion was constructed at the Bon Andrews Oval in 1930. H.M. Queen Elizabeth II and H.R.H. Duke of Edinburgh drove through St Leonards Park in front of 48,000 school children on 18 February 1954. A plaque set in sandstone is located in a low stone wall opposite Carlow St, facing Miller St within the Park to commemorate the occasion. =Phase 5: Post-war boom, 1960s-present= The construction of the Warringah Expressway altered the eastern boundary of the park, with the resumption of 1.2 hectares of parkland and the separation of the Sewer Vent from the park. Grass netball courts were constructed during the 1960s to the south of the bowling club near Ridge St for use primarily by local schools. An additional two asphalted courts were constructed in 1992. In 1960, the North Sydney Leagues Bowling Club was granted a special lease 1960/227 for perpetuity to exclusive occupation upon the Crown Land. Council's trusteeship was terminated. Approval for a new clubhouse was given, financed and constructed by the Club. The Club also received an additional 1.4 hectares of land for car parking and for a larger clubhouse. The club house building was built in 1960-61 after approval on 11 October 1960. In 1984, the Bob Stand was relocated from the Sydney Cricket Ground to North Sydney Oval. Originally constructed in 1895, it is a fine late nineteenth century shelter covering tiers of seating. On 10 February 1984 there was a land exchange involving North Sydney Council exchanging the car park (532.6 sq.m) to the south of the bowling club houeLot 1104 DP46990 for equal areas of land to the north and east of the bowling greensLots 1106 & 1107 DP 46990 to be transferred back to being part of St. Leonards Park. The Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Marathon event on 1 October 2000 commenced outside St Leonards Park with spectators viewing from the Park. The starting line painted across Miller St, North Sydney is still visible today adjacent to the Park. A blue line was painted along Miller St to mark the course of the Marathon, across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, to finish at the Olympic Stadium. North Sydney Oval continues to be used for local, regional and interstate sporting events. A record crowd of 23,089 was set in 1994 for a match between North Sydney and the Manly Sea Eagles. DA 81/12 in 2012 proposed alterations to the bowling club house to provide office accommodation for the RSL sub-branch. The application was granted consent on 4/4/2013. Unauthorised paving was carried out, prior to 21 November 2014, to part of the northern bowling green and the use of this paved area for the service of alcohol and outdoor dining. In September 2016 the NSW Land & Environment Court upheld an appeal against North Sydney City Council's deemed refusal of DA78/16 for the internal refurbishment of the main bowling club house; to provide extra toilets; continued use of part of the most-northern green and specify hours of operation and patron no's for the NSBC subject to conditions. In 2018 it was announced that North Sydney Council would commence an upgrade of the park including improving the war memorial with a reflection pool, restoration of the Tunks Fountain and elevation on a new plinth, new benches, picnic tables, barbecues and drinking fountains, upgrades to lighting, additional tree planting, and an expanded playground.  Description  St Leonards Park is a nineteenth century area of parkland that covers approximately . The dominant feature, other than the open areas of park is the North Sydney Oval complex with its playing field, grandstands and commercial spaces, the Parks depot and a childcare centre. North Sydney Oval ( Oval No 1) - The original open village-green oval that has remained in existence since its dedication in 1867, making it one of the oldest cricket grounds in Australia. The National Trust Listing of 1993 refers to it as the oldest. It includes the Bob Stand, constructed in 1895, and re-located from the Sydney Cricket Ground to St Leonards Park in 1983. The Duncan Thompson stand was constructed in 1929 and was, at the time of construction, the largest suburban grandstand in NSW. Other architectural features of note include: *Bon Andrews OvalA rectangular sports field with an amenities building named the Cunningham Pavilion. It is constructed in the Inter-War style with a 1990s addition by architect Feiko Bouman. The oval has been in use since 1894.Oval No 2 *Music ShellThe Music Shell was designed by acclaimed architects Peddle Thorp and Walker in the Art Moderne style. It is a two level building at the rear which provided a band practice room with storage for chairs. At the front, the stage area is enhanced by a dramatic roof structure that is enhanced by relief sculptures and other refined detailing, including urns and decorative grilles on either side of the stage. *Tunks Memorial FountainThis fountain is a Sicilian marble fountain that was installed in the park in 1885 in honour of William Tunks, first Mayor of East Leonards and Member of State Parliament. Tunks was instrumental in the establishment of St Leonards Park, its early layout and plantings. *War MemorialThe War Memorial, constructed 1926, is an imposing Inter-War Art Deco style cenotaph made from Bowral trachyte. It is 13m in height and was, at its time of construction, the largest and most imposing war memorial constructed in Sydney. Subsequent plaques have been added to the war memorial to commemorate later wars. *World War I Field GunThis is a field gun mounted on a pedestal in the north-west corner of the park. The field gun was captured from the Germans in France in 1918. This and other similar war weapons were distributed to Army units, schools and communities as a reminder of the sacrifice of the armed services. *PlaygroundThe children's playground is located on the site of what was the site of two tennis courts in the 1930s and is contained within a Depression period concrete rusticated fence. *Stone ShelterThis shelter was constructed from rock-faced sandstone in 1943 with four arches and a terracotta tiled roof. There are four concrete tables. *Oval Bus ShelterOriginally a former tram stop, the Oval Bus Shelter is a small timber rectangular structure comprising stop-chamfered timber posts on concrete pads, supporting a timber framed hipped roof covered with terracotta shingle tiles. It is designed in the Late Twentieth Century Post Modern style. *Air Raid TrenchesAlthough filled in, the Second World War saw the construction of slit air raid trenches in St Leonards Park in a zig-zag configuration across the northern end of St Leonards Park and in the area now near the War Memorial. *North Sydney Leagues Bowling ClubThe land for a bowling green was set aside in 1887 with the first clubhouse constructed in the 1880s and since demolished in the 1960s. The existing club building was financed by the club. *Open ParklandSt Leonards Park has a gardenesque character with open lawns studded by both remnant native trees and planted specimens of indigenous species that represent the site's original plant community. These include: Callitris rhomboidea (Port Jackson pine), Corymbia gummifera (red bloodwood), Eucalyptus haemastoma (scribbly gum), Eucalyptus piperita (Sydney peppermint), and Syncarpia glomulifera (turpentine). Other trees that have been planted include: Ficus macrophylla (Moreton Bay figs), Ficus rubiginosa (Port Jackson figs). Ficus hillii (Hills weeping fig), Araucaria bidwillii (Bunya Bunya pine), Toona australis (red cedar), Lophostemon confertus (brushbox), Macadamia integrifolia (macadamia), Melaleuca quinquenerivia (paperbark), Eucalyptus citriodora (lemon-scented gum), Eucalyptus botryoides (Bangalay), Eucalyptus cinerea (Argyle apple), Quercus robur (English oak), Populus nigra var. italica (Lombardy poplar), and Phoenix canariensis (Canary Islands palm). A few dead tree stumps have also been retained for their habitat value for nesting sites of the local parrot species and possums. Significant group plantings include the: Fig tree avenue in Fig Tree Lane which commemorate the closure of the portion of Carlow St within the park; Araucaria trees and Eucalyptus citriodora (lemon scented gum) row plantings along the Falcon St edge; Lophostemon confertus (brush box) row plantings along the Miller Sedge; Phoenix canariensis (Canary Islands palm) row plantings in the north-western corner of the park and either side of Tunks Avenue, north of the War Memorial Rotary Wheel Rose Garden and Tree, Memorial trees commemorating significant people and events include the: Judge Bouler Tree, J. D. Fletcher Tree after James Duncan Fletcher. = Condition = All elements in the soft landscape of St Leonards Park are in excellent condition. The War Memorial and Tunks Fountain are in good condition however, the setting has been cluttered by light poles and an enclosing wall extension to the North Sydney Oval complex. North Sydney Oval is in excellent condition however, the pavilions and grandstands are generally in a fair condition with the Duncan Thompson Stand being in poor condition. = Modifications and dates = The North Sydney Sewer Vent was originally located within St Leonards Park, however it was separated by the Falcon Street exit ramp when the Warringah Expressway was constructed in the 1960s. It is now located on a small landscaped island and is listed as a State Heritage Item (285047). = Further information = The 1836 park layout is largely intact with the only exception being the acquisition and excise of land for the 1960s construction of the Warringah Expressway. The original 1870s pathways and plantings are still evident and are representative of Victorian era public parks. The three main sporting venues, the two ovals and the bowling greens are continuing in their use in their original location. The original landmark fig trees planted along the main avenues are largely intact and replacement planting has been undertaken where trees have been lost from age or storms. The later development that occurred in the park during the 1930s and 1940s with the construction of the War Memorial, Music Shell, playground and palm trees avenues also imbue a strong aesthetic character sympathetic to the Victorian era park plan. The major park upgrade in the 1980s by architect Feiko Bouman saw the upgrading of the North Sydney Oval complex, the re-surfacing of pathways, new lighting and the re-location of the Bob Stand from the Sydney Cricket Ground to North Sydney Oval.  Heritage listing  St Leonards Park is of state heritage significance for its historical values as one of the earliest established public parks in NSW being set aside as a recreation reserve in 1838 and gazetted as a public park in 1867.

In addition, the area black residents raised $1,500 for the school's construction. $18,400 of government money was the remainder used to construct the school, meaning it was built for a total of $21,600. Lakeland, on of land, was in proximity to railways and was centrally located, so the Prince George's school board selected it as a high school site. Communities in its attendance boundary included Lakeland, Beltsville, Hyattsville, Laurel, Muirkirk, and North Brentwood. Lakeland became a part of the City of College Park in 1945. By the 1940s Laurel and Mount Rainier, along with other communities, were served by Lakeland High's bus service, and the Highland Park area was added to the bus service in 1946.Lakeland Community Heritage Project Inc.

Americas =Argentina= Commercial advertising in Argentine television (including cable channels operated from the country itself) is limited to 12 minutes per hour. In-programme advertising is allowed, but counted toward the 12-minute quota, means that if a 60-minute show has 2 minutes of in-programme advertising, the commercial breaks have to be limited to 10 minutes for that specific hour, otherwise the station might face a fine. Promos for future television programs are considered as an advertisement, and also counted within the quota. Argentine television channels used to be required to separate advertising from the rest of the programming using bumpers with the text \\"Espacio publicitario\\" (\\"Advertising space\\") from September 2010 to May 2016. From March 2014, advertisements shown on Argentine television began to use the phrase \\"Aviso publicitario de producción nacional\\" (Advertisement for domestic product) and \\"Aviso publicitario de producción extranjera\\" (Advertisement for foreign product) for local and foreign advertisements, respectively. Also, advertisements for alcoholic products had the warning \\"Beber con moderación. Prohibida su venta a menores de 18 años\\" (Drink in moderation. Do not sell to persons under 18). The warning was not used in alcohol advertising before 1997. =United States= Theater commercial about an electric refrigerator, in 1926 Around the Corner (1937) In the United States, the Nielsen ratings system measures audience viewership of television programs, and provides a way for television broadcasters to determine how popular their television shows are, so that they can decide what rates to charge advertisers for air time. For each hour in a broadcast day, advertisements take up a fairly large portion of the time. Commercial breaks have become longer. In the 1960s a typical hour-long American show would run for 51 minutes excluding advertisements. Today, a similar program would only be 42 minutes long; a typical 30-minute block of time now includes 22 minutes of programming and eight minutes of advertisements – six minutes for national advertising and two minutes for local. A television broadcast of the 101-minute film The Wizard of Oz (1939) for instance, could, in the early to mid-1960s, take two hours even with advertisements. Today, a telecast of the same film would last between 2½ and three hours, including advertisements. Because of this, it is common practice to edit films to fit within the time allotted. Over the course of 10 hours, American viewers will be shown approximately three hours of advertisements, twice what they would have seen in the 1960s. If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements. In the 1950s and 1960s, the average advertisement's length was one minute. Starting in the early 1970s, the average length shrank to 30 seconds. The 15-second commercial began to appear in the late 1980s. TV advertisements were coded for identification by broadcasters via an ISCI code. As of March 31, 2014, Ad-ID has been mandated as the standard method of identification for TV advertisements. A special case of TV advertisements are rare or one-time events known as Mega Event Advertising. Popularity In the United States, the TV advertisement is generally considered the most effective mass-market advertising format, and this is reflected by the high prices TV networks charge for commercial broadcasting airtime during popular TV events. The annual Super Bowl American football game is known as much for its commercial advertisements as for the game itself, and the average cost of a single 30-second TV spot during this game (seen by 100 million viewers) has reached US$4.5 million (as of February 2013). It has been suggested that, in general, television executives believe that advertisers covet the 18–49 age demographic and that older viewers are of almost no interest to most advertisers due to their unwillingness to change their buying habits. Products intended for older consumers, such as certain health products and insurance, are advertised regularly on television, generally during programming that appeals to older adults. The number of viewers within the target demographic is more important to ad revenues than total viewers. According to Advertising Age, during the 2007–08 season, Grey's Anatomy was able to charge $419,000 per advertisement, compared to only $248,000 for an advertisement during CSI, despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average. Due to its demographic strength, Friends was able to charge almost three times as much for an advertisement as Murder, She Wrote, even though the two series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together. Broadcast networks are concerned by the increasing use of DVRs by young viewers, resulting in aging of the live viewing audience and consequently, lower advertising rates. TV advertisers may also target certain audiences of the population such as certain races, and people of a certain income level or gender. In recent years, shows that tend to target young women tend to be more profitable for advertisements than shows targeted to younger men. This is due to the fact that younger men are watching TV less than their female counterparts. In the United Kingdom, television advertising is considerably cheaper than in the United States of America. The current record for an advertising slot on British terrestrial television is quoted at being £250,000 for a 30-second slot during the 2010 series of Britain's Got Talent. However while British TV advertising is cheaper, this is only to be expected as the United Kingdom has a much lower population (63 million) compared to the US (310 million). So if the £250,000 figure is adjusted into American terms, the population being 5 times bigger and the exchange rate, this figure would become $2 million, much closer to the U.S. Super Bowl figure. Because a single television advertisement can be broadcast repeatedly over the course of weeks, months, and even years (the Tootsie Roll company has been broadcasting a famous advertisement that asks \\"How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie center of a Tootsie Pop?\\" for over three decades), television advertisement production studios often spend very large sums of money in the production of a single thirty-second television spot. This significant expenditure has resulted in a number of high-quality advertisements with high production values, the latest in special effects technology, the most popular personalities, and the best music. A number of television advertisements are so elaborately produced that they can be considered miniature thirty-second movies; indeed, many film directors have directed television advertisements both as a way to gain exposure and to earn a paycheck. One of film director Ridley Scott's most famous cinematic moments was a television advertisement he directed for the Apple Macintosh computer, that was broadcast in 1984. Although this advertisement was broadcast only once (aside from occasional appearances in television advertisement compilation specials and one 1 a.m. airing in Idaho a month before the Super Bowl so that the advertisement could be submitted for the 1983 Clio Awards), it has become famous and well-known, to the point where it is considered a classic television moment. Despite the popularity of some advertisements, many consider them to be an annoyance for a number of reasons. The main reason may be that the sound volume of advertisements tends to be higher (and in some cases much higher) than that of regular programming. The United States Congress passed a bill on September 30, 2010, called the CALM Act, to reduce the sound volume of advertisements, and loudness rules set by the FCC are effective as of December 13, 2012. In the UK, the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice has a similar regulation. The increasing number of advertisements, as well as overplaying of the same advertisement, are secondary annoyance factors. A third might be that television is currently the main medium to advertise, prompting advertising campaigns by everyone from cell-phone companies, political campaigns, fast food restaurants, to local businesses, and small businesses, prompting longer commercial breaks. Another reason is that advertisements often cut into certain parts in the regular programming that are either climaxes of the plot or a major turning point in the show, which many people find exciting or entertaining to watch. Restrictions Television commercial in 1948 Beginning on January 2, 1971, advertisements featuring cigarettes were banned from American TV. Advertisements for alcohol products are allowed, but the consumption of any alcohol product is not allowed in a television advertisement (for example, an actor in a beer commercial cannot be shown actually drinking the beer). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have laid out regulations for television advertising, outlining restrictions on certain products, content, and claims, in addition to mandating minimum technical standards. Additional content standards are set by individual television broadcast entities to accommodate local laws, community standards, and their particular audience demographic; these broadcast outlets examine each incoming advertisement through a process known as \\"clearance.\\" Manufacturers of liquor products also adopted a voluntary code not to advertise on radio and television, which is particularly aimed at avoiding exposure of liquor advertisements to children. When companies dropped this ban, federal regulators appealed to the industry to reinstate code while the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was also asked to look into potential restrictions on liquor advertisements on television. This was the case because, under the Communications Act, this agency has the power to regulate broadcasting as \\"public convenience, interest, or necessity requires.\\" Aside from the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also has the authority to regulate television advertising in instances of \\"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce.\\" The passage of the 1990 Children's Television Act (CTA), restricted the length of advertising in children's television programming to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. Advertisements as programming Since the 1960s, media critics have claimed that the boundaries between \\"programming\\" and \\"advertisements\\" have been eroded to the point where the line is blurred nearly as much as it was during the beginnings of the medium, when almost all individual television shows were sponsored entirely by a single corporation (the model which was carried over from old- time network radio). For much of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the FCC imposed a rule requiring networks that broadcast programming on Saturday morning and Sunday nights at 7 p.m./6 p.m. Central to air bumpers (\\"We'll return after these messages...\\", \\"...now back to our programming\\" and variations thereof) to help younger audiences distinguish programs from advertisements. The only programs that were exempt from this rule were news shows and information shows relating to news (such as 60 Minutes). Conditions on children's programming have relaxed to an extent since the period of the 1970s and 1980s. Europe In many European countries, television advertisements appear in longer, but less frequent advertising breaks. For example, instead of 3 minutes every 8 minutes, there might be around 6 minutes every half-hour. European Union legislation limits the time taken by commercial breaks to 12 minutes per hour (20%), with a minimum segment length of 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the programme content. Live imported telecasts with shorter segments, such as U.S. sporting events, replace the original ads with promotional material. Advertising broadcast time can vary within the EU and other countries and between networks depending on local policy. Unlike in the United States, in Europe the advertising agency name may appear at the beginning or at the end of the advert. =Croatia= In Croatia, the commercial broadcasters may show up to 12 minutes of advertising per hour, while the public broadcaster HRT, being partially funded by a license fee, shows less advertising and usually does not interrupt series and films. Tobacco advertising is banned but alcohol and non-prescription medications can be advertised on TV. Political advertisements are allowed only in the short official campaign period before an election and only in separate blocks from other advertisements. =Denmark= The Danish DR-channels are funded by a television licence, so they do not show any advertisements. The other Danish television network, TV2 shows advertisements only in blocks between the programs. These can take from 2 minutes to 10 minutes depending on the time to the next show. In Denmark, commercial breaks are strictly prohibited and advertising targeted to children is restricted. Channels like Kanal 5 and TV3 are allowed to interrupt programs, as these channels are being broadcast via satellite from the United Kingdom. =Finland= In Finland, there are two mainstream non-commercial channels run by the state-owned broadcasting company Yle, that run advertisements only on very infrequent occasions, such as important sport events. The three main commercial channels MTV3, Sub (a subsidiary of MTV3), and Nelonen, all run their advertisements during breaks approximately every 15 minutes. Since digital TV has been introduced, the number of TV channels has grown, with Yle and the main broadcasters all adding new channels (including some subscription channels). Analogue broadcasts ceased in August 2007 and the nation's TV services are now exclusively digital. A typical break lasts about 4 minutes. The length of individual advertisements can vary from a few seconds (7, 10, and 15 are common), and they are currently rarely over one minute in length. Many advertisements of supranational companies are commonly dubbed from English language advertisements. Although Swedish is the other official language of Finland, the advertisements do not feature Swedish subtitles nor are any Swedish language advertisements shown with the infrequent exception of some political advertisements at the time of elections. =France= The Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel allows up to 9 minutes of advertising per hour on average in a day, and 12 minutes in an hour. Private channels can only broadcast one commercial break if the show is less than an hour and two commercial breaks if the show is more than an hour. For public channels, advertising is allowed up to 6 minutes per hour on average, and forbidden after 8 pm. =Germany= As in Britain, in (Germany), public television stations own a major share of the market. Their programming is funded by a licence fee as well as advertisements on specific hours of the day (20 minutes per day; not after 8 pm), except on Sundays and holidays. Private stations are allowed to show up to 12 minutes of advertisements per hour with a minimum of 20 minutes of programming in between interruptions. =Greece= In Greece, where most television stations and channels do not remove their logo before a commercial break, it is mandatory for public and commercial TV stations to separate the advertisements from the rest of the program with each station's ident. Subliminal advertising, tobacco and medication advertisements are not allowed. Most programmes (series, documentaries, etc.) can have one commercial break every 20 minutes. Advertisements must not exceed 15% of the broadcasting day or 20% if there are direct advertisements for buying or renting products (like informercials). A commercial break must not exceed the length of 4 minutes with the exceptions of movies/telefilms with the length exceeding the 45 minutes, which can have one commercial break for 9 minutes and of the movies/telefilms that exceed the length of 110 minutes which can have more than one commercial break every 45 minutes for 9 minutes. =Ireland= Filming a movie ad In Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland determines the number of adverts on commercial and community TV stations, while the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is responsible for the advertising limits of Public Service Broadcasters on TV and Radio, and commercial radio advertising is governed through statute. The first television adverts were shown on December 31, 1961. But in the early years all were in B&W; but in the 1970s came in colour television arrived. Adverts were very popular over the years the most popular names were Gateaux Cakes, Tayto Crisps etc. Up to 2010 commercial broadcasters were permitted a maximum of 15% advertising time vs. overall broadcast time. In 2010 TV3 asked for an increase in advertising minutes due to the high level of competition from advertising opt-outs coming into Ireland via satellite and cable pay providers, and also the number of live ITV programmes carried by TV3 (such as The X Factor). The BAI agreed to increase the number of ads on commercial TV broadcasts to bring Irish commercial TV channels into line with UK commercial TV channels. The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland also lobbied for a similar increase, but the regulator was unable to increase their advertising minutes as these are written into Statue, meaning that any change is the responsibility of the members of the national parliament (The House of the Oireachtas). Commercial Broadcasters may not exceed 18% of their broadcast day on advertising and they may only have a maximum of 12 minutes of adverts per hour, except for children's programming where advertising may not exceed 10 minutes per hour (commercial TV broadcasters include TV3 and Setanta). Irish community TV channels rarely show advertising; however, they are permitted to show 6 minutes of advertising per hour. RTÉ TV and Radio carry a maximum of 9 minutes per hour of advertising, but only an average of 6 minutes of advertising per hour, and the same rules apply to TG4: this amounts to 10% of total broadcast time. On television, RTÉ cannot carry advertising on RTÉ News Now and RTÉjr; they do not carry advertising on programming for the under 6s, RnaG or their Digital Radio services. On the international television day, Tuesday, November 21, 2017, there was a rerun of some old television adverts after the 6 and 9.00 news on RTE1 that appeared on the Irish Film Archive on Wednesday, April 26, 2017. On Tuesday June 30, 2020 there will be more hidden Irish adverts restored on the website Britset Archives. =Italy = Until the 1980s, the Italian television and the broadcasters of the other European countries didn't do any commercial advertisement during films, soap operas, TV series and documentaries. Usually, the publicity intervals had a duration limited from 5 to 10 minutes and hidden publicity was categorically forbidden out of the established TV timetables. The commercial TV, namely the Mediaset group founded by Silvio Berlusconi, imported in Italy a model of propaganda that was diffused by some decades before in the American countries. It consisted of short spots directly focused on attracting the consumer in the shortest possible time. The same modality was suddenly copied by the public television. =Norway= Television advertising is regulated by the Broadcasting Act. Public service broadcaster NRK is licence-funded, and cannot carry advertising, however, sponsorship of programs (typically sport events) is allowed. Commercial channels may interrupt television programmes with ads, but certain conditions apply. The maximum amount of advertising is 15% per hour (09 min). The nation's second-most-watched channel – TV2 – is funded by television advertisements. Norwegian-language programs broadcast from abroad – such as TV3 Norway broadcasting from the United Kingdom in the Norwegian language – must comply to British regulations. Political TV advertisements are strictly prohibited, as are all advertisements for tobacco and alcohol. TV advertisements are monitored by the Norwegian Media Authority (Medietilsynet). =Poland= In Poland, the national public broadcaster, Telewizja Polska, is partially funded by a licence fee. Advertising breaks on public television can be broadcast only between programmes, except for live events (mostly sport) that contain breaks which can be interrupted. Commercial broadcasters can interrupt programmes for advertising, but some channels (like e.g. Canal+) broadcast their programmes uninterrupted. Furthermore, all programmes featuring sponsor's names or products are required to announce it by a short label at the beginning and end of the programme. Tobacco and alcohol adverts are banned under the Health Protection Against the Consequences of Tobacco Use and Tobacco Articles Act of November 9, 1995, and Education in Sobriety and Counteracting Alcoholism Act of October 26, 1982, but adverts for beer, although restricted, can be shown between 20:00h and 06:00h. By agreement unhealthy food ads have been banned since January 1, 2015 on children's channels such as MiniMini+, TVP ABC and Nickelodeon and on other programming aimed at children but has been criticised for raising TV rating on nationwide general TV channels for animated movies aimed to children as well as family movies (mainly on TVN and Polsat) as well as in talent show programs involving children (e.g. The Voice Kids of TVP2 or Mali giganci of TVN) to +12 in order to avoid restrictions on unhealthy foods by making it more attractive for advertisers. Since April 1, 2017 bookmaker advertisement became restricted under amended Gambling Act of November 19, 2009 which cannot be broadcast between 06:00h and 22:00h (except for sports broadcasting) and during childhood and youth programming. =Russia= The Russian advertising break consists of 2 parts: federal adverts and regional adverts. The duration for each is 4 minutes and 15 minutes per hour respectively. Like Greece, Russia is one of the few countries where the television channel's logo is retained during the commercial break. In Russia, tobacco advertising is prohibited, and in 2013, this was followed suit by alcohol and medication advertising. During the Soviet era, advertising was decreed non-existent, and instead, airtime was occupied by propaganda materials. =United Kingdom= In the UK, the BBC is funded by a licence fee and does not screen adverts. On the commercial channels, the amount of airtime allowed by the UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom for advertising is an overall average of 7 minutes per hour, with limits of 12 minutes for any particular clock hour (8 minutes per hour between 18.00 and 23.00h). With 42-minute American exports to Britain, such as Lost, being given a one-hour slot, nearly one-third of the slot is taken up by adverts or trailers for other programmes. Live imported television programmes such as WWE Raw show promotional material in place of U.S. advert breaks. Infomercials (known as \\"admags\\") were originally a feature of the regional commercial ITV stations from launch in 1955 but were banned in 1963. The first advert to be shown on ITV in the UK was an advert for S.R. Toothpaste on September 22, 1955. On July 1, 2000, TV broadcasters began requiring commercials to be delivered to them in widescreen, an event referred to as C-Day in industry promotion of the change. In 2008, Ofcom announced a review of television advertising and teleshopping regulations, with a view to possibly changing their code, Rules on the Amount and Distribution of Advertising (RADA), which regulates the duration, frequency and restriction of adverts on television. Television advertising specialist, Nick Illston, of advertising-buying agency Pace Media, states that ITV's £250,000 asking price for a 30-second slot during the 2010 series of Britain's Got Talent is currently the most expensive advertising slot on television. After a dip in popularity around 2014 TV advertising is now back on the rise. With on-demand services in the video field as well as music, the game has changed, but TV stations have found a way to integrate their standard TV advertising into their streaming platforms. When you include on-demand viewing, commercial TV reaches 91.9% of the UK every week, which means the average broadcast TV ad campaign gets 237 million views. £5.28 billion was invested in TV advertising in 2016, that's up 0.2% from the year before. , it was forecast to grow by another 1.6%. Paid for political advertising is banned on television in the United Kingdom. Instead parties are given a free Party political broadcast at the time of an election. Asia and Oceania Depending on its style, system and other factors while in the process of broadcasting commercial breaks and TV advertisements, some officials (like government, associations, institutions, etc.) regulate and monitor the assets and broadcasting TV advertisements based on international standards. =Australia= Similar to the European Union, advertising on Australian commercial television is restricted to a certain amount in a 24-hour period, but there are no restrictions on how much advertising may appear in any particular hour. Australian television has one of the highest proportions of advertising content in the world. Currently, in primetime on Seven and Nine’s primary channels there can be 686 minutes or more of heavy advertising (inc. local news updates) per day. During live sports broadcasts, individual commercial breaks last for 30 seconds instead of 3–5 minutes. Furthermore, product advertisements with informational content are labeled \\"public service announcements\\" and not included in the time restrictions; similarly with sponsorship announcements, and station identifications. Consequently, there may be less than 40 minutes of actual programme time per hour. Foreign, all television programmes and films are noticeably cut, re- edited for digital Channels; comedy shows often return from an ad break into laughter, for instance. Australia is also one of the few countries in the world where advertisements may appear prior to, and over the top of, the closing credits of a program. There are some restrictions on television advertising in Australia, such as a complete ban on advertising for cigarettes, as well as advertising during programmes intended for young children. The ABC, the nation's public broadcaster, broadcasts no external advertisements, but between programmes will broadcast promotions for itself, its own programmes and merchandise, although this is restricted to approximately five minutes per hour. SBS had similar restrictions on advertising until 2005 when it began airing external advertisements between programmes, and subsequently, during programmes, like the commercial networks, although still limited to 5 minutes per hour with the first advertisement being half-hourly news updates. Back in 1978, major commercial networks had the longest ever ad break run with the record 353 minutes of advertising. =India= In India, the Code for Self-Regulation of Advertising in India, established by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), is applicable on Television Commercials (TVCs). If consumers see an advertisement which they consider misleading or offensive, they can write to ASCI. As per the provisions under The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995, and the Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channels from India (first introduced in 2000), give the government the power to block the transmission and re-transmission of any channel in the country. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has clear guidelines for TV advertising in India. The Indian television channels are widely segmented through Broadcast television, Cable television, Satellite television, Internet Protocol television. There are 857 permitted private satellite stations and also 190 government channels under the list of television stations in India. The TV advertising rate varies for TV ad spots, regional/national channels, prime/non-prime time and also on the media planning platform. The Advertising Standards Council of India has defined the principles and guidelines for individuals, corporate bodies and associations engaged in or otherwise concerned with the practice of advertising for medium such as television. The principles include honest representations, non-offensive to public, against harmful products/situations, fair in competition. The guidelines include Automotives & Safety, Educational Institutions, Foods & Beverages, Disclaimers in an Advertisement. =Indonesia= Television advertisements in Indonesia currently based on Act No. 32 of 2002 on Broadcasting and regulated by the KPI. All advertisements must pass the censorship criteria set by the Film Censor Board (LSF) before airing. Television advertisements began airing on TVRI on 1 March 1963, about half a year after the first broadcast. The New Order government officially banned television advertisements on TVRI starting 1 April 1981, effectively stopped television advertisements in Indonesia as TVRI was the only television channel at the time. However, as the private television stations emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s they were allowed to air commercials, while TVRI could not be allowed to broadcast advertisements until 2000. According to the act, advertising time is limited to both public broadcasters (i.e. TVRI and local public broadcasters) and commercial private broadcasters. While received funding from state or local budgets, public broadcasters are allowed to run advertisements to a maximum of 15% of their broadcast time. In contrast, public service announcements for a minimum of 30% of its advertising time should be air. Commercial broadcasters could run advertisements to a maximum of 20% of their broadcast time, while they should air a minimum of 10% of advertising time for public service announcements. Cigarette advertisements are still allowed between 21.30 – 05.00 in local time but are prohibited from demonstrating the appearance of cigarettes and smoking activities. Any advertisements featuring liquor are banned. =Japan= In Japan, TV advertisements are called \\"Commercial Messages\\" or CMs. There are many kinds of advertisements, one is called the \\"Cow-catcher\\" where the advertisements are shown before the start of a program, the \\"Hitch-hiking\\" type where the commercials are shown after the end of the program, and the \\"Spot CM\\" are the commercials being shown on commercial breaks. There are regulations for example: commercials for pachinko parlors are prohibited from being shown from 5AM to 9AM, and from 5PM to 8PM.http://www.minapachi.net/column/article/3/511 Tobacco advertisements are banned since 1998. To prevent underage drinking, alcohol commercials are banned from being shown from 5AM to 6PM. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, a government department monitors television advertisements rather than a private institution. Almost all television stations and channels in the country, whether government-owned, private or pay television channels, broadcast advertisements, with television channel logos removed before the start of the commercial break. There are usually two commercial breaks in a half-hour programme and three commercial breaks in an hour-long programme, with the exception of news programmes. Terrestrial television can only broadcast advertisements during the programme that was currently aired except before announcing the breaking of fast in the month of Ramadan, although advertisements may be included during CJ Wow Shop on Media Prima television channels such as NTV7 and TV9 as of June 2016. Because Malaysian television advertisements were controlled by the government department, the Malaysian TV advertising permit number appears during the first few seconds of any advertisement. The abbreviation at the first part of the permit number which refers to the ministry which handles the TV advertising permit number always changes sometime after the Malaysian government made a new portfolio of ministers and name changes to some ministries after the general election. The usage of advertising code began in 1995, with KP/YYYY/XXXX of which KP means Ministry of Information, YYYY is the year the advertisement produced and the XXXX is the number of the advert permit. This was replaced by KPKK (Ministry of Information, Communications and Culture) and KKMM (Ministry of Communications and Multimedia of Malaysia) in 2009 and 2013, respectively. The usage of advertising code has declined in recent years, although it remains in use in almost all advertisements shown on RTM. Other advertising permits includes the KKLIU (Ministry of Health, the Medicine Advertising Authority) for medicinal advertisements, which was used before 1995 and the JIRP (Pesticide Advertising Department) for pesticide advertisements. All pesticide advertisements must show the words \\"INI IKLAN RACUN MAKHLUK PEROSAK\\" (This is a pesticide advertisement, previously INI ADALAH IKLAN RACUN PEROSAK) and JIRP advertising code at the beginning of the advertisement and the words \\"BACA LABEL SEBELUM GUNA\\" (Read the label before use, previously BACALAH LABEL KELUARAN SEBELUM MENGGUNAKANNYA) at the end of the advertisement. It was also used in advertisements on newspapers and magazines. Astro is also known to delay incoming satellite feeds by two to five minutes (some channels delay by one hour) from the actual time of the start and the end of programme (for example a programme aired at 13:30 will be started at 13:33) with broadcasting advertisements during in-between programmes for its purpose of commercial replacement, as government laws forbid advertisements produced from overseas, with exceptions such as film trailers (since release dates may include more than one country). Liquor advertisements shown after 22:00 during non-Malay programmes have been banned in the country since 1995, while cigarette advertisements were banned from showing cigarette packaging in 1995, and were banned entirely in 2003. Fast-food advertisements during children's programmes were also banned in 2007. There are also restrictions on Malaysian television regarding advertisements for 18-rated films, women's sanitary products and unhealthy foods which must not be broadcast during children's programmes, and lottery advertising, which is prohibited during Malay programmes. Lingerie advertisements are prohibited on Malaysian television, but allowed in non- Malay magazines published in Malaysia. Also, promotion of television programmes for sponsored programmes are treated separately from programme promotions, though some channels had the sponsor name being advertised in programme promos. =New Zealand= All major New Zealand television channels, both state-owned and private, screen advertisements. Adverts on average taking up 14 minutes of each hour; there are usually two advert breaks in a half-hour programme, and four advert breaks in an hour-long programme. Television advertising began in New Zealand in April 1961, ten months after the first official television broadcast, and was initially allowed only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Today, television adverts are only prohibited on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, and between 6:00 am and midday on Sundays, Christmas Day and Anzac Day. The Advertising Standards Authority is responsible for advertisement compliance, and deals with advertisement complaints (except for election advertising, in which the Broadcasting Standards Authority is responsible). =Philippines= Philippines advertising industry is self- regulated. The Philippine advertising industry adopted an Advertising Code of Ethics essentially to promote efficiency in processing applications and resolution cases and avoid costly litigation in regular courts. The earliest Advertising Code of Ethics dates back to the Philippine Board of Advertising (PBA) established in 1974. In 1989, the PBA was renamed Advertising Board of the Philippines (ADBOARD) and was mandated by the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 7394 or The Consumer Protection Act to ensure that all advertising materials conform to its Code of Ethics. The ADBOARD Advertising Content & Regulations Committee (ACRC) had been the main implementing arm of advertising self-regulation in the Philippines until March 31, 2008, when the Ad Standards Council (ASC) took over this function.http://www.asc.com.ph/about-asc/story-of-asc The Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines, a self-regulatory organization representing most television and radio broadcasters in the country, limit advertising to 18 minutes per hour, a move taken to help \\"promote public interest.\\"\\"KBP: Only 18 minutes of ads per hour\\", Inquirer Entertainment, In this case some TV broadcasters have to remove channel logos (like ABS-CBN, 5 & GMA) before starting a commercial break. Also, all commercial content and advertisements will start (right after for most TV shows will break) before or after TV program announcements/etc. Some TV commercials to be aired requires ASC clearance if the content has trivial facts and testimonies. Since television was introduced to the Philippines in 1953, they used imported TV advertisements until 1960, the same way in which they used billboard advertisements during the American period. In the 1960, P&G; paved their way to start the first local TV advertisement. In 1966, when the Philippine TV turned from black-and-white to color, Colgate-Palmolive was the first to advertise in color. Some ads have any of the following notices indicated either during or at the end of the commercial depending on type of products. * \\"For 18 years (old) and above only. Drink Responsibly\\" (formerly \\"Drink Moderately\\"). for alcoholic beverages. * \\"Member: BancNet (formerly MegaLink)/Expressnet and PDIC (or vice versa).

The voice-over will be a standard version supplied by TELA.On December 1, 1988, the banned period was extended from 4:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. and commercials had to carry a visual health warning taking roughly one-third of each frame of each commercial so that it was showing throughout the period of the commercial.

Under the current rules, terrestrial channels cannot take in-programme commercial breaks. So, the advertisements are usually put between the intro and the start of a programme, and between the end credits and the end of the programme. Terrestrial channels often divide some longer-length films like The Ten Commandments into parts and consider each part as an individual programme. Terrestrial channels can take commercial breaks during breaks in action during sporting events. Pay- television channels can take in-programme commercial breaks, although some pay TV channels schedule advertisements in the same way that terrestrial channels do. Regulations for advertisements on terrestrial channels are more strict than those for pay channels. Non-South Korean channels are not subject to these regulations. Tobacco advertisements are prohibited.

Biography  = Provenance and early years = Hanna \\"Hanneke\\" Groenteman was born in the Rivierenbuurt quarter, on the south side of Amsterdam. Her parents' home was next to an ice cream parlor. Michiel Groenteman, her father, worked at the Amsterdam stock exchange. Her mother, born Rachel Smit, worked as a stenographer. When she was ten months old the country was invaded. Her early years were in many ways defined by the German occupation. The family was identified as Jewish, and after the order was received to report for deportation they went into hiding. To reduce the risk of discovery, children were separated from their Jewish parents under these circumstances, and Hanneke was accommodated in a succession of secret locations, organised by the (\\"Utrechts Kindercomité\\"). Her longest wartime placement was also the last: for eighteen months between 1943 and 1945 she lived with the Van Starkenburgs, a loving family of committed Christians, in the village of Rijnsburg, close to the coastal resort of Katwijk. She bonded closely with her \\"aunt\\", Cor van Starkenburg, and has remained close to the von Starkenburg family subsequently. After the war she returned to her birth-parents' Amsterdam home, now in the house of an uncle who had died in the war. The mood was troubled. The family had survived, but plenty of relatives and family friends had not. Her father's mother had been murdered at Sobibór. Her mother's parents, however, were now living with the family. The child pined for \\"Aunt Cor and Uncle Kees\\" while finding her relationship with her birth-parents difficult (\\"moeizaam\\"). She attended the nearby and then undertook a secretarial training with the Schoevers \\"business school\\" before studying French for several years at the university.

On 30 April 1980, together with the radical journalist , and in collaboration with Amsterdam's independent , she reported on the rioting that accompanied the new queen's coronation. Although the riots were instigated as a protest against the housing shortage under the slogan \\"No homes, no coronation\\" (\\"Geen woning, geen kroning\\"), their scale and the accompanying violence led to suggestions that many of the participants had arrived with a larger agenda, and there was a public backlash against the protestors. It was very clear that both Groenteman and Stan van Houcke - with the backing of VARA radio director Piet van den Ende - sympathised with the squatter movement. There were questions () in parliament.Vragen van het lid Verbrugh (G.P.V.) over de uitzendingen van Radio Stad-Amsterdam en de VARA op 30 April.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The building was demolished in 2015 and removed from the NRHP in 2020. History The Fenton Seminary was founded by Rosina L. Dayfoot under the auspices of the Baptist Church, as a feeder preparatory school for students attending Kalamazoo College. It first held classes in a frame structure, but in about 1868 the school constructed this building. The seminary operated for nearly 20 years, offering classes in business, languages, music, and calisthenics. However, in 1886, the board of trustees deemed it impossible to continue operating, and the school was closed. The trustees offered the building to the Baptist Ministers Aid Society, and it served as a home for retired ministers. A fire in 1899 gutted the interior and destroyed the roof; the building was reconstructed in 1900 with an altered roof and facade. The building continued to be used by the Baptist Ministers Aid Society, then as an apartment complex and a convalescence home, until 1967. There were several attempts at rehabilitation, but the building remained vacant until 2014, when it reverted to the city of Fenton for back taxes. The city demolished the building in September 2015. Description The Fenton Seminary was a two- story stone building. It was originally constructed as a three-story structure in the Second Empire style, but during the reconstruction in 1900, the original mansard roof was replaced with a hip roof, creating a two-story structure. The front facade had a porch with stone piers, accessed with a stairway. A central gabled dormer on the roof was flanked with decorative metal ones.

The dam has also been opposed by conservationists, including concerns that the dam would impact the Irwin's turtle.  Dam Proposal  The Urannah Dam is a $2.9 billion project, proposed as a 1.5 million megalitre dam that includes a water pipeline network, an irrigated precinct, and pumped hyro-electricity storage and power generation infrastructure. The dam would provide water to mining in the region, as well as agriculture. The project proponent is the Bowen River Utilities, previously the Urannah Water Scheme. According to the latest Preliminary Business Case, over a third of water from proposed dam would be for current and expanded coal mining in the Bowen Basin.Urannah Dam Preliminary Business Case Main Report: https://urannahwater.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/11/UrannahDampreliminarybusinesscase-mainreport.pdf Supporting regional mining expansion is first and foremost of the opportunities listed for the water allocation in the report. The supplementary 'Water Demand Study' states that within the region there are 30 active coal mines, and 57 proposed coal mining projects, and that there is a major shortfall of water needed to supply the Bowen Basin coal industry. Urannah Dam has also been linked to expansion of coal mining in the Galilee Basin. The dam was first proposed in the 1960s. Since then, there have been over 25 feasibility studies into the dam, but the project had not proceeded beyond that stage. A report assessing the cost benefits of the dam project found that for every dollar spent on the dam, only 75 cents would be returned.An Economic Analysis of the Urannah Dam Project https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/dudgeonpointorg/pages/508/attachments/original/1467269724/Urannah_Economic_Analysis.pdf?1467269724 In December 2019, the Government gave $10 million in funding for a business case and Environmental Impact Statement to be developed. This is expected to be completed by late 2021. In May 2020, the project was declared a coordinated project by Queensland's Coordinator-General. The construction date is listed as 2022. in 2016, there was also Federal funding of $3 million given for a feasibility study for the project. There were concerns raised about the allocation of this funding despite Urannah Dam not being on a list of priority projects sent to the then Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce. Major concerns over conflict of interest were also raised, as the funding was awarded to the company Initiative Capital, which was run by an LNP member and party donor.  Cultural significance  Urannah is part of the homelands of the Wiri and Birri peoples of the Birri Gaba Nation. Urannah contains sacred sites, including burial sites and ceremonial sites. \\"We are the river people our river is sacred it is our life it gives us the connection to our land and the beginning of creation. It is our duty to protect our BIRI (river) against the rapid demand for water supplies to the Mining Industry in the Bowen Basin.

Environmental significance  Urannah valley is a pristine and undisturbed ecosystem, home to many terrestrial and aquatic species. Urannah contains a diversity of terrestrial habitats, including steep mountains and forested valleys, and over 20 plant species have been recorded at Urannah. Forest ecosystems at Urannah includes the endangered bluegum forests , as well as ironbark and black iron box forest.Sutton, I. 2004. Urannah – What’s at risk?

Urannah is home to the IUCN listed \\"near threatened\\" black necked stork (Jaiburu), and the \\"vulnerable\\" grey falcon. 30 species of birds have been identified at Urannah, including kookaburras, cockatoos, eagles, honey-eaters, owls kingfishers and pelicans. Urannah is home to Koalas, betong, and several species of kangaroo, including the tree kangaroo, the grey kangaroo, and the pretty face wallaby. Flowing through Urannah are Urannah creak and the Broken River, which is part of the Burdekin river system. These rivers are home to Urannah’s most iconic animal, Irwin’s turtle, Elysea irwini., which was discovered by Steve and Bob Irwin. The turtle is endemic to the Broken-Bowen River system and the lower Burdekin River, and is of high conservation significance, with a restricted range that places the species at risk of decline. According to the Threatened Specific Commission, the proposed development of Urannah Dam would have a significant negative impact on Irwin’s turtle.Threatened Species Scientific Committee. 2009.

This book is a Bildungsroman that recounts the story of Aron Kleinfeld's life from ages eleven to fifteen in a poor area of Jerusalem. Plot The story takes place in the neighborhood of Beit HaKerem, Jerusalem in the 1960s. It explores Aron's internal struggles as well as his convoluted relationships. Aron is introduced as a dreamer and a leader to his friends in make-believe games. However, as time goes on, his parents and his friends begin to shame him for his lack of physical and mental maturity. His parents are ashamed of his physical shortcomings and his school friends grew tired of his childish imagination. Aron's relationship with his parents only becomes more strained as he approaches his Bar-Mitzva (a Jewish coming of age ritual for boys). His mother, in an attempt to convince herself that Aron has grown more than he really has, makes Aron wear thick socks to create an illusion that his feet have grown. Initially, Aron glorifies his physical condition and scorns adults for losing their individuality, but he shortly becomes depressed due to his inability to live up to his mother's expectations. In Aron's point of view, the world of adults is disloyal, full of troubles and dull. He refuses to grow up, maintains his integrity and avoids acting like an adult in order to escape puberty.

It was designed and built by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. It is also known as North Sydney Sewer Vent and Alfred St Sewer Vent. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  Part of the original North Sydney sewerage system built by the government between 1891 and 1898. Oral history sources have revealed that prior to the construction of the Bradfield Highway, foul odours permeated the area. Successive complaints may have led to the removal of the dome which is no longer in situ. Odours are still detectable under certain climatic conditions. Expressway construction in the 1960s may have been responsible for severe movement in the shaft of the structure which may have caused cracking. Stabilisation has been undertaken, involving the introduction of steel hoops around the brickwork. The stack was originally wholly within St Leonards Park, however as this was reclaimed by the Highway, the vent now stands on an island separate to the Park.  Description  A brick ventilation stack built high, and a diameter at internal base of , tapering to at the top of the structure. The original design included a pagoda-like dome at the apex of the structure, however the top is currently defined by a cement redered parapet. The base of the structure contains an iron inspection hatch into which is engraved, \\"Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage 1899\\". Brickwork is slightly ornamental but is more austere than that of similar stacks built earlier on the southern side of the Harbour. Parallel steel bands now encircle the structure, introduced during the 1960s as a stabilisation device. The vent is considerably intact. = Modifications and dates = The ventshaft is located alongside the Cahill Expressway. Some of the cracks that are present along the length of the ventshaft may be the result of earth movements during the construction of the expressway in the 1960s. As such, a series of circular steel bands have been applied to the exterior of the Vent, at evenly spaced intervals, as a stabilisation measure. = Further information = Refer to other inventory listings for Lewisham Sewer Vent, Bellevue Hill Sewer Ventshaft, Glebe Sewer Ventshaft, Marrickville Sewer Ventshaft.  Heritage listing  As at 30 November 2001, the North Sydney Sewer Vent is an excellent representative example of the tall brick sewer ventilation shafts which were constructed around the turn of the century to facilitate the efficient functioning of the major outfall sewers. Its functional design is embellished by a successful application of architectural motifs, such as line and texture which lend the structure an element of formalism and classical detail including entasis. In addition, it displays high quality workmanship in the brickwork. By virtue of its scale and form, it has landmark value within the Cremorne / Crows Nest area and acts as a navigational beacon for motorists using the Bradfield Highway. It has the potential to invoke a sense of the past as its style and design contrast dramatically with the modern styles of architecture endemic to the North Sydney streetscape. It is currently serves the NSOOS in the manner in which it was originally designed. The North Sydney Sewer Vent was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The ventshaft is an important and essential part of the original North Sydney sewerage system, which still remains. It played a large role in dissipating odorous gases from the system and away from residential/street levels. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The ventshaft is an excellent example of brick work with ornate sections at and around the base and entasis to the shaft. It is a landmark on the North Sydney expressway and adds to the landscape of the adjacent park, St Leonards Park and North Sydney Oval. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The ventshaft is significant in the development of the sewerage system itself. Without the ventshaft gases built up within the system were extremely dangerous to the community and the workers and is therefore likely to be held in high regard by the community for its function. It has been identified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Ventshafts and their development show the progress made in understanding how and why gases formed in the sewerage system. They also show how the different types of ventshafts were employed to dissipate odorous gases. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare in the SWC system and in NSW as one of a small number of ventshafts of its type limited to the late nineteenth century period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

He worked as a painter, draughtsman, print maker, sculptor and writer in Madrid and Seville.Biblioteca Nacional de España; http://datos.bne.es/persona/XX1508565.html  Biography  Jose Andres Rossi was born in Madrid. His surname appears as Rossi, Rosi, Roszi, Roso or Rosso in different texts. The fact that he signed with a double \\"s\\" suggests an Italian ancestry (though it was often subsequently changed to \\"Rosi\\" in the inscriptions of many of his prints). Rossi attended the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid. In 1799 he placed second in the Academy's yearly competition with his drawing of Publio Furio Filo. He is described as a patriot of the \\"Dos de Mayo Uprising\\". During the Peninsular War he moved to Seville fleeing from the French. Rossi wrote to King Ferdinand VII twice asking to be considered for a position as a Court painter. His request was ignored both times. In Seville he taught Fine Arts in addition to pursuing his own career as an artist; In 1814 he was named \\"Lieutenant Director of Painting\\" in the Royal Academy of the Three Noble Arts (now known as the Royal Academy of Fine Arts), where he also lectured. Rossi trained artists such as Juan Pérez de Villamayor when he arrived in Seville in 1825. In 1829 his role as Lieutenant Director was re-confirmed. In 1835 was asked to join a commission to catalogue art pieces that would be used to create a new museum in Seville along with Juan de Astorga and José Domínguez Becquer, among others. In 1841, by order of Queen Isabell II (then under Espartero's regency), he also carried out an inventory of paintings from the Academy of the Three Noble Arts. In 1845 he joined the sculpture department in the same academy, along with Juan de Astorga and Jose Maria Gutierrez.  Work  Andres Rossi was a distinguished print maker. His work is generally centred around biblical, military and classical themes, though he was also inspired by other current affairs of the time in prints such as Justice executed on Pedro Piñero aka El Maragato. His patriotic feelings during the Peninsular War are reflected in prints such as Atrocious murders of Spaniards in 'Prado de Madrid'. His print named Cornelia at the Duke's feet can be found in the Museo del Prado, where his print, Allegory of painting, was also shown as part of an exhibition named Spanish drawings from the Hamburger Kunsthalle: Cano, Murillo and Goya. His print named Lady drawing, an exceptional theme as the arts were very restricted to women at the time, can be found at the Museum of Romanticism in Madrid. In addition to his prints, two of his oil paintings have been preserved; a still life, signed “Andrés Rossi, the Spaniard” and a religious altarpiece which can be found in the church of El Santo Ángel in Seville. In 1820 he started writing a treaty which he titled; Spirit of Perspective or Elementary Treaty of Perspective for Artists. The original document is kept in the Museum of Romanticism in Madrid. Furthermore, his contribution to sculpture has also been recorded; the sculpture of Saint Veronica from the El Valle brotherhood paso in Seville has been attributed to him. It was carved in 1815. The original drawing can be found in the Museum of Romanticism in Madrid. The Three Marys from the same paso are attributed to Juan Bautista Patroni. Rossi, along with Francisco Alcántara and Antonio Rodríguez, presented the Sancha publishing house with series of illustrations for the publication of Cervantes’ Persiles and Sigismunda. However, their offer was rejected and José Antonio Ximeno y Carrera’s designs were used instead. In 1830 he took part in the renovation of the Alcázar of Seville gardens where he painted mythological scenes in the gallery. The paintings represented scenes from Virgil's Aeneid and Theseus in front of the labyrinth. He also took part in the renovation of the Museum square as the art director. This renovation was carried out to celebrate the Queen's wedding.  Timeline of his work  * A man (1790-184-?) Spanish National Library * S. R. S. Fernando (17??)

Her research spans literary disciplines, she is a specialist in Old English and Norse literature, and she has published on runes, Middle English, Victorian and contemporary poets and writers, film, and is a translator and fiction writer. She is Professor Emerita at UC Davis.  Academic career  Professor Osborn's holds a BA from the University of California, Berkeley, class of 1962. She holds an MA and PhD from Stanford University, completing her postgraduate study as the first supervisee of Fred C Robinson in 1969. She has held a teaching position at UC Davis since 1981, retiring to Emerita status in 2007. Osborn has also taught or held fellowships at the Universities of Oxford, Syracuse, Columbia, Lancaster, Edinburgh, Queen's Belfast, Alaska, Hawaii, Iceland, and UC Davis.  Research  Osborn held a research Fellowship at The Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, University of Edinburgh in 1973, during which time she researched Old English poetry and developed her interest in 'place study'. Osborn went on to hold a Fulbright Fellowship to Iceland, 1978–79 and 1983-84. Arising from this work in Scotland and Iceland, Osborn and her collaborator, Gillian Overing, pioneered the application of place study to early medieval literary studies in their book Landscape of Desire (1994), which was dismissed or ignored by some scholars at the time, but is now recognised as pioneering ecocriticsm. Osborn's translation of Beowulf, published as a Verse Translation with Treasures of the Ancient North (1983), brought together material culture from across northern Europe to 'help us visualise the world of the poem'. Osborn is well known for her work on medieval work in translation, especially the Old English poem Beowulf. In 2003, the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies published Marijane Osborn's annotated list of over 300 translations and adaptations.

The church was built by Tafield and Collins; and the pipe organ was built by Charles Richardson. It is also known as St. John's Uniting Church and Pipe Organ and Richardson Pipe Organ. The property is owned by the Uniting Church of Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Presbyterian congregation was established in Neutral Bay in 1889. Land for a church was donated by Captain Robert Craig and the foundation stone was laid on 26 April 1890. Architect was Charles H. Slatyer of 96 Pitt Street, Sydney and builders were Messrs Tafield and Collins. The church was opened on 19 July 1890. An 1890 photograph shows the church as an austere gothic structure consisting of the central four bays of the present building. It was enlarged in 1898 and in 1908. The pipe organ was installed in 1912, the manse built in 1920, and the school hall in 1923. = Pipe organ = Description The church is a buttressed brick building with stone trims and a steep gabled roof. The interior is plastered and each bay is occupied by a memorial tablet. There is an elaborate carved pulpit and two windows in the organ chamber designed by Norman St Carter (sic) and executed by F. J. Tarrant of Darling Harbour. The diagonal boarded hammer-beam roof features nailed laminated arches. The organ (1912) is a rare intact example of the work of Charles Richardson, who was the most prominent organ-maker in New South Wales from 1883 to 1920. It features a case design which is unique for its period, and is a late example of the use of tracker action to the manuals. This building is designed in the Victorian Free Gothic style. =Modifications= The originally slate roof was replaced in 1979 with concrete tiles. The north end, a later addition, has a large three-light lancet window and a well-proportioned stone-trimmed entry porch. The organ chamber at the south end, also a later addition, is separately roofed.  Heritage listing  The church is a competent late Victorian example of the gothic style arranged to meet Presbyterian liturgical requirements. Its corner site makes it significant in the streetscape. The use of thin laminations as an integral part of the circular arch roof structure makes the building unique for its date in structural terms. The organ is significant as being a rare intact example of the work of Charles Richardson, the most prominent organ- builder of New South Wales from 1883 to 1920.

History Long Lau was originally established by several Khmu families around 1944. In 1977, an additional seven Hmong families from Bo Leo mountain in the Mueng Nan District of Luang Prabang Province came to the village. The Hmong population gradually increased due to the relationships between families, kin and friends with Hmong families from other villages in and outside the province. Although they lived in the same village, Khmu and Hmong families lived in separate residential clusters. By 1995, due to population growth, Long Lao village had divided into two smaller villages. The Khmu cluster became Long Lau Kau village, while the H'mong cluster became Long Lau May village. This division was mainly done in terms of administrative and demographic structure. However, village boundaries, cultivated land, livestock and forest resources had not been divided. Accordingly, people of one village could go into the other for cultivation, collecting forest products for daily life as well as worshiping the Nature Spirit.Veerle, Vandenhende (2014). \\"Nature spirit - An Approach to Biological Human Ecology Theory\\" Geography Long Lau May village is located in the southwest of Luang Prabang, 18 km from the Luang Prabang World Heritage UNESCO City.

Her installations include film, photography, sculptures, and edible and wearable technology. Career McRae uses technology and design to create what she calls body architecture. She describes herself artistically as exploring the limits and adaptability of the human body and its emotional impact in the face of futuristic science and technology. Her work has been exhibited at the Science Museum London, the Royal Academy of Arts, Centre Pompidou, Venice Biennale, Science Gallery Melbourne and Broached Commissions. She has spoken at RMIT University, MIT media lab, Central St Martins, Tribeca Film Festival, Hyper Island and The Bartlett. McRae has been listed by Fast Company magazine as one of the ‘fifty people shaping the future’.  Biography  McRae was born in 1979 in London. She trained in classical ballet in Melbourne and later studied interior design at RMIT University. After graduation she moved to London and went on to work at Philips Design in the Netherlands in 2006. She led their Far Future Design research lab that focused on emotional sensing. The team developed wearable technologies including a dress which responds to a wearer's emotions as well as electronic tattoos implanted in the skin that changed by touch. Her Bubelle Blush dress sensed the wearer's emotions and then interpreted those readings as lights on the dresses outer layers. The dress was listed as one of Time magazine's best inventions of 2007. It was at Philips Design that McRae met Bart Hess, a Dutch designer. They created the photographic collaboration \\"LucyandBart\\" using various materials to transform human bodies and faces into a work of art. In 2010 McRae was supported by a veski award in design in collaboration with RMIT University for a series of lectures and workshops and a solo exhibition titled ‘Breed Out’ at the Mars Gallery in Melbourne. She created Swallowable Parfume in collaboration with the synthetic biologist Sheref Mansy. Swallowable Parfume is made up of a fragrant lipid molecule which mimics the natural fat molecules found in the body. Once the body metabolises these lipids, fragrant molecules are released through perspiration on the skin. In 2012, McRae was invited to join the TED Fellowship programme and spoke at TED Long Beach on \\"How can technology transform the body?\\" She exhibited ‘Future Day Spa’ at the London Design Festival where audiences experienced a feeling of relaxation and weightlessness by being wrapped in a plastic-foil membrane inside a vacuum chamber as if they were preparing for space travel. Her short fictional film 'Institute of Isolation' inquires how the human body is sustained physically and mentally in the extreme environment of space travel and prolonged isolation. She was one of the artists exhibited at Experimenta Make Sense: International Triennial of Media Art, an exhibition that expresses the disconcerting and delightful world of the digital age. In 2018, McRae collaborated with University of Melbourne researchers Niels Wouters and Nick Smith on 'Biometric mirror' a sci-fi installation which was part of the Science Gallery Melbourne's pop-up exhibition titled, 'Perfection'. Biometric mirror was based on the idea of using computer vision algorithms to show a mathematically perfect face. She was selected as a Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum in 2018.

In particular, the Army was seeking to produce a new generation of autonomous 20 mm to 40 mm gun- launched projectiles that could correct its course mid-flight. Doing so would increase the capabilities of infantry units as well as decrease the weight of munitions that soldiers would have to carry. Micro adaptive flow control is largely defined by the active manipulation of aerodynamic flows using small time-dependent actuators in carefully chosen locations. By taking advantage of flow instabilities, the system can generate large amounts of energy from using only a small fraction of the overall flow if the actuators and their activity are properly assigned. As a result, MAFC can enable low power yet highly distributed redundant actuation systems in contrast to flow systems that utilize steady blowing where high velocity flows must be provided through complex and high-loss ducting. Rather than configuring the shape of the munition with fins or canards to control its trajectory, the SCORPION project aimed to integrate these tiny actuators on the munition that pump out brief spurts of air at a high frequency (around 1000 Hz). By emitting these bursts of air for just a few milliseconds at a time, these small synthetic micro-jet actuators were capable of modifying the projectile's flow characteristics and pressure distributions. In short, the jets of air were able to steer the munition by creating an asymmetry in the airflow surrounding the projectile, producing a strong enough force to affect its trajectory largely due to the Coanda effect.  Development  The SCORPION program was divided into two phases, Phase I and Phase II. The former focused on constructing the flight control system and determining whether MAFC could be integrated into a 40 mm round to provide adequate guidance to its target, while the latter prioritized determining whether MAFC technology could be used to steer projectiles that were smaller and even faster than those used in Phase I. By 2005, Phase I had been completed, and the SCORPION program was chosen as a DARPA demonstration program in order to further investigate the use of MAFC in high-velocity, small-diameter projectiles. The SCORPION program concluded in 2007 after successfully demonstrating the use of MCFA to maneuver a 40 mm rifle-launched grenade. = Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling = A significant portion of the SCORPION program was focused on the development of new computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to model microadaptive flow control and better understand the complex aerodynamic interactions associated with using microjets to control the trajectory of spin-stabilized projectiles. Detailed flow physics simulations were specifically developed to aid in the design of the projectile shape and the placement of the synthetic actuators. Time-accurate unsteady CFD computations were also used to predict where, when, and how the aerodynamic force would interact with the projectile as well as characterize the flow field produced by the synthetic jets for various yaw and spin rates. The models also allowed researchers to explore various firing sequences for the synthetic actuators. During simulations, turbulence was initially modeled using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. However, the predictions were less accurate than expected when applied in the context of unsteady flows associated with synthetic jets. As a result, a new hybrid approach known as the large eddy simulation (LES) approach was developed to properly account for the large eddies present in the turbulent flow structure while retaining high fidelity. This new approach allowed researchers to accurately calculate the lift force along with other aerodynamic forces that assisted them in the design of the actuator, flight control, and sensor system of the projectile. = Wind tunnel tests = In order to characterize the air flow that would surround the projectile in the air, researchers conducted a series of wind tunnel tests on a 40 mm grenade model. The tests were also conducted on a spinning wind tunnel model to simulate the airflow of a spinning projectile. These tests primarily served to optimize the placement of the synthetic jets. The wind tunnel tests also helped demonstrate that the aerodynamic surface of the projectile needed to be smooth during an important portion of its trajectory in order for the Coanda effect to generate the necessary divert force. During the wind tunnel experiments, the researchers also took detailed Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the airflow traveling downstream of the projectile in order to fine-tune the actuators. Such measurements led to a redesign of the projectile's tail to include a shallow channel for the jet. = Flight experiments = During development, researchers conducted flight experiments on the SCORPION munition to better understand the type of propellant and cartridge case design they needed in order for the projectile to launch at 0.8 Mach. These experiments took place at the Transonic Experimental Facility at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and specifically focused on firing 25 mm munitions from a 25 mm barrel. The internal electronics of the munition held devices for recording data, including magnetic field strength, the angular rate in both the pitch and yaw directions, and acceleration in all three orthogonal directions. The flight dynamics of the projectile were then analyzed from the raw data during post-flight processing. The flight tests also served as an opportunity to explore methods of soft recovery for the 25 mm projectile. Doing so allowed ARL scientists to test the idea of using layers of draped Kevlar to safely absorb the kinetic energy of the projectile. = Open loop tests = The control authority of the SCORPION munition was tested at the ARL Transonic Experimental Facility through a series of open loop tests where the test rounds were preset to move to the left or the right at a fixed time after launch. Using wind tunnel data and modeling software to predict control force magnitudes, ARL scientists demonstrated that the SCORPION munition could be diverted in any direction, showing that the projectile possessed sufficient control authority to correct for trajectory variations. In addition, the munition's electronic and sensor system exhibited a notable level of robustness such that one projectile was reprogrammed and launched ten times and still remained functional afterwards. = Challenges = One of the main challenges that appeared during the development of the SCORPION munition was the task of integrating all the required components into the 40 mm grenade form factor. In order for the projectile to operate properly, the component not only had to fit inside the munition and still function as an integrated system, but they also had to be able to accurately evaluate the state of the munition while withstanding the high g-force of the gun launch and the high spin rate of the projectile. Another challenge that the researchers encountered during development was the construction of the integrated circuit boards responsible for measuring the state of the round and controlling the actuator. This sensor package included a 3-axis magnetometer, an axial accelerometer, four radial accelerometers, and a 2-axis radial accelerometer, all of which had to fit inside the 40 mm munition and undergo shock testing.  Projectile design  The general design of the 40 mm SCORPION munition was based on the M781BT practice grenade. However, the design of its telemetry and sensor system, which was developed by ARL scientists, was based on ARL's diagnostic fuze (DFuze) sensor system. Used primarily to determine the projectile flight dynamics along the trajectory, the telemetry system consisted of a three-axis magnetometer, four radial accelerometers, an axial accelerometer, a suite of four Yawsondes, and a two- axis accelerometer for transverse acceleration. The magnetometers measured the projectile's orientation to the roll angle and earth's magnetic field, the accelerometers measured the projectile's acceleration in the x, y, and z directions, and the Yawsondes measured the projectile's angular orientation to the sun. An encoder board was included in the munition in order to process the sensor data and communicate it to the ground station. Through the use of the magnetometers and the Yawsondes, the angular state of the projectile could be identified. The accelerometers helped measure the accelerations of the SCORPION in the x, y, and z directions, and an encoder board was present inside the projectile to collect the sensor data and send it to the ground station. Due to how 40 mm grenades are spin stabilized and have highly nonlinear aerodynamics, researchers undergone several tests to understand the aerodynamic nonlinearities and flight dynamics of the projectile's trajectory. Experiments with the base model have shown that these projectiles exhibit fast and slow mode angular precession, meaning that the aerodynamic control system must not only deal with a spin rate of 60 Hz, but also account for the nonlinear response of the round. Both the rotational motion and the precession of the projectile served to greatly complicate how the projectile respond to control forces. Based on the analysis from the wind tunnel tests, the researchers specifically developed a sabot pusher system to launch the projectile so that the aerodynamic surface of the projectile remain smooth to allow the Coanda effect to generate the divert force. As a result of its telemetry system, the researchers could monitor the forces on the SCORPION as it flies to its target. However, in order to control its flight path, the projectile employed MAFC through the use of tiny synthetic jets embedded on the surface of the projectile. Developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, these synthetic jet actuators were designed to fire bursts of air to alter the flow field and pressure distributions of the surrounding air. When turned on momentarily, these synthetic jets used those tiny, short bursts to correct the trajectory of the projectile as it traveled towards its target. As active control devices with zero net mass flux, the synthetic jets produced the desired amount of control of the flow field through momentum effects. They acted as steering devices for the projectile, using a minute-vibrating diaphragm-like system powered by piezoceramic elements. Due to the tiny air vortices created by the synthetic jets, an asymmetry in the airflow could be created around the projectile. In addition, the resulting Coanda effect multiplied this effects of this phenomenon, producing air flow changes that were strong enough to change the projectile's trajectory. The SCORPION's electronics have also undergone g-hardening to withstand the heavy forces generated during each launch. However, issues still remain with this design. The SCORPION projectile lacks sufficient payload room for a full guidance system as well as a greater explosive power. As a result, additional features proposed for the SCORPION munition included adding more space in the projectile for explosives and a system that would let the projectile detonate at a pre-set detonation point. Researchers have also investigated the use of gas-generator actuators that utilize miniscule explosive charges instead of jets of air to steer the course of the projectile. In addition to the 40 mm SCORPION, a 25 mm SCORPION was also developed. Designed similarly to the 40 mm model, the 25 mm SCORPION munition consisted of two sections, the electronic control module and the actuator module. The electronic control module was a potted cylindrical container that houses the power, driver, IMU, processor, and connector boards as well as a removable ogive that provided the user with access to communication and data. The projectile also included the command guidance and the inertial sensor suite (ISS), the latter of which held the oscillator board, the processor board, and the sensor suite. The sensor suite contained 2-axis rate sensors, 3-axes accelerometers, two radially oriented accelerometers, and 3-axis magnetometers. The actuator module was kept separate from the rest of the assembly in order to prevent any potentially hazardous material like a propellant from seeping into the electronic control module until just prior to firing. The SCORPION's propulsion system consisted of a cartridge case that held the propellant and an obturator that sealed the high pressure combustion gasses inside. The obturator served to transmit torque for spin stabilization and distributed axial force to accelerate the projectile within the gun tube. According to flight experiments conducted at the Army Research Laboratory, the 25 mm SCORPION successfully established the charge weight needed to meet the velocity requirements when launched at 0.8 Mach.

While waging an insurgency against the Afghan government, he has been accused of committing several war crimes.  Biography  = Early life and service with the Taliban = Nemat initially was a field commander of the Taliban (flag pictured), but was expelled from the movement in 2014. An ethnic Uzbek, Nemat originally was a religious teacher and mufti in First Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum's home village in Jowzjan Province. At some point, Nemat became a Salafist and joined the Taliban, forming a small private army to fight for Qush Tepa District. He eventually rose to head of the Taliban military committee for the districts of Darzab and Qush Tepa in Jowzjan, and was considered to be an \\"important\\" field commander for the insurgents. It is possible that Nemat took part in \\"Operation Badr\\", a major Taliban offensive in northern Afghanistan in 2011. According to Pajhwok Afghan News, he even served as shadow governor of Jowzjan at some point, and was addressed with the honorific title \\"Maulvi\\". Despite this, Nemat was also increasingly criticised by his superiors for various irregularities, including abuse of authority, harassment and torture of locals over taxation, and corruption. While visiting Pakistan in 2013, Nemat was arrested by the Taliban over these issues, and expelled from the rebel movement in 2014. In response, Nemat made a deal with Vice President Dostum in December 2014, and officially surrendered to the Afghan government with 220 of his followers in February 2015. He and his fighters were promised salaries for six months, and help in finding new civilian jobs. For the next two years, he stayed in Sheberghan, hoping to gain an appointment as commander in the pro- government militias. Nemat also started a Salafi madrasa called E'ya-ye Sunnat (\\"Rehabilitation of the Sunnah\\"), and organized classes for male and female students. His Salafist views aroused great opposition from the local religious establishment of Hanafi clerics, resulting in several public debates between Nemat and a number of his opponents. State authorities eventually shut down his madrasa and banned him from teaching in Jowzjan Province in November 2016. Believing that neither Dostum nor the rest of government had upheld their part of the agreement with him, Nemat consequently resumed his insurgency. He joined forces with Qari Hekmat, the leader of the region's branch of ISIL's Khorasan Province. Though Nemat later argued that his decision to join ISIL-K stemmed from ideological conviction, an expert of the Afghanistan Analysts Network said that he had probably been more motivated by \\"power-saving opportunism\\". = ISIL-K commander = Commanding about 80 fighters, Nemat became the commander for all ISIL-K forces in Darzab's Sar Dara area, and was also appointed by Hekmat as head of ISIL-K's local military court. In course of 2017, ISIL-K grew increasingly powerful in northern Afghanistan, and almost completely captured Darzab District from the Taliban and government forces, including Dostum's militias, in April. At the time, government officials regarded Nemat as one of the most important Islamic State commanders, stating that \\"he knows the Darzab District and the area very well; he is a very dangerous guy\\". Darzab consequently became the group's stronghold, though it repeatedly attempted to expand into other areas. Hekmat was killed by a US airstrike in April 2018, and the other northern ISIL-K commanders consequently elected Mawlavi Habibul Rahman, Nemat's brother-in-law, as their new leader. An expert speculated that Nemat might have played an important role in the succession; in any case, he became ISIL-K's second-in-command for Jowzjan Province after Mawlavi Habibul Rahman's appointment. While serving with ISIL-K, Nemat reportedly committed numerous war crimes.  Surrender  Voice of America report about the surrender, including an interview with Mufti Nemat Despite their military successes in 2017, ISIL-K remained threatened by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan, as the latter repeatedly attempted to oust the Islamic State militants from Darzab. A major Taliban offensive in July 2018 eventually overwhelmed ISIL-K's defenses and brought the group's northern branch to the brink of destruction. The Taliban rejected offers for a ceasefire, and demanded that Nemat, alongside Mawlavi Habibul Rahman and Sibghatullah, ISIL-K's local head of finances be handed over to them. At this point, the northern ISIL-K branch split, with a substantial number of fighters defecting to the Taliban, while the three commanders and their loyalists decided to contact the Afghan government and offered their surrender in exchange for protection from the Taliban. Nemat and his fellow fighters, along with their families, consequently fled to government lines in the night, protected by Commandos and the Afghan Air Force. Following his surrender, the ISIL-K militants were transported to Sheberghan, where they were treated rather well despite the protests of many local civilians and soldiers. Nemat subsequently gave several interviews to the press, declaring that \\"fake news\\" were responsible for the Islamic State's bad reputation. He claimed that he and his followers had only launched an insurgency because they were met with hostility by the \\"whole world\\", and that he wanted people to accept ISIL's ideology \\"with their hearts, not by force\\". Regarding his future, Nemat said that the \\"Afghan government must save my life and provide me with security\\" as it promised to do so before the surrender, and that he was not guilty of any crimes. Despite these claims, several women had previously accused him of having abducted and raped them. This was notable, as it was \\"the first time Afghan women have come forward and accused IS fighters of rape\\". Rape victims in Afghanistan usually do not speak out due to rape being a taboo topic in the country's society. Other civilians accused ISIL-K of having executed over one hundred civilians, including children, and of practising slavery in Darzab.

He raped and killed 4 girls in the satellite town of Bataysk in Rostov-on-Don.  Biography  The exact date of birth and birthplace of Cheryomukhin is not clear. He was a spoiled child, who always got what he wanted. It is known that in his youth Cheryomukhin learned that his father was not really his father, as he was barren and allowed his mother to have children from extraneous men. Specialists believe that the discovery deformed Cheryomukhin's psyche. Newsru.Com He was tried twice for car theft. The series of murders began in 1986. The first murder (that of Svetlana Yefimova) was committed by Cheryomukhin earlier the year, after which he burned the body of the murdered girl at a stake. All three subsequent murders (Elena Gaeva, Tanya Khloboschina and Oksana Yakovenko) were also committed with particular cruelty. He offered the intended victims a ride in his personal car, then brought them to a deserted place and killed them. After the murders, Cheryomukhin cut off their mammary glands and external genitalia from the victims. In those years in the Rostov Oblast, another killer was operating - Andrei Chikatilo. His search involved a whole team of investigators from the Prosecutor's Office of the RSFSR, there was an operation named \\"Lesopolosa\\" to catch the killer. The investigators drew attention to the murders in Bataysk, initially assuming that the same killer was operating there. But then the investigation revealed that the murders were committed by another person, since he traveled to the crime scene by car and took away the victims' valuables (unlike Chikatilo). Cheryomukhin hoped that his crimes would be compared to that of Chikatilo. The investigators were surprised that a cunning and cautious killer began to kill in the midst of a large-scale operation to catch another criminal. In early 1989, Cheryomukhin was arrested and soon confessed. On November 3 of the same year, the Rostov Regional Court sentenced him to death. In 1993, he was executed by firing squad. = In the media = * Documentary film from the series \\"The investigation was conducted... - Chikatilo's twin\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   External links  * Maniacs and serial killers: Konstantin Cheryomukhin 1963 births 1993 deaths People executed for murder Soviet rapists Russian people convicted of child sexual abuse Soviet serial killers Male serial killers Executed Soviet serial killers Murderers of children People from Novocherkassk ","title":"Konstantin Cheryomukhin"},{"id":"58417405","text":"Mitrella angustalineata is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Columbellidae, the dove snails.MolluscaBase (2018).

Ю. Биологические теории о преступной активности женщин // Криминология: вчера, сегодня, завтра. 2013, № 4 (31). — C. 41.  Biography  Maria Petrova enjoyed swimming since childhood, but was uncommunicative and withdrawn. Once, according to her own statements, she was raped. The rapist, according to Petrova, was a young man. After that, as she claimed, she was molested by an elderly colleague at work, and developed a deep hatred for men. She taught physical education at the Moscow Electron-Technological College, showing the following characteristics:Petrova also had a degree in psychoneurology. She had a masculine appearance: a muscular figure, broad shoulders and was pretty tall. On March 1, 2002, Petrova killed 20-year-old Sergei Makariev by stabbing him twice with a knife. Subsequently, she explained that he harassed her, but no witnesses confirmed this. The murder took place at the bus stop of the Shalom Theater, near Varshavskaya Metro Station. On March 27, Petrova killed a 60-year-old pensioner, Nikolai Zhabin, by cutting his throat. Subsequently, Petrova committed three more attempted murders (all victims survived), and was suspected of another attack, but was not charged due to lack of evidence. All attacks were carried out in the same way - stab wounds to the peritoneum and neck. Petrova was not afraid of being caught, as she committed her crimes in front of dozens of people. Having a sufficiently public profession as a teacher and committing crimes in one area, she was soon exposed and arrested on April 23, 2002. Petrova soon confessed to everything. She was charged with killing two and attempting to kill four more people. The forensic psychiatric examination recognized her as insane and sent her for compulsory treatment.

Had the UK and EU failed to conclude such an agreement, the UK's unilateral departure from the EU could have disrupted, for an unknown duration, many aspects of the relationship between the UK and European Union, including financial transfers, movement of people, trade, customs and other regulations. Operation Yellowhammer was intended to mitigate, within the UK, some of the effects of this disruption, and was expected to run for approximately three months. It was developed by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS), a department of the Cabinet Office responsible for emergency planning. In early August 2019, after Boris Johnson had become Prime Minister, the Cabinet Office \\"was not able to confirm\\" that the Operation Yellowhammer plan remained in place, although a Yellowhammer document from earlier that month was leaked in mid-August to The Sunday Times journalist Rosamund Urwin and continues to be updated. On 3 September 2019, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove, whose responsibilities include preparations for a no-deal Brexit, said in the House of Commons: \\"Operation Yellowhammer assumptions are not a prediction of what is likely to happen, they are not a best-case scenario or a list of probable outcomes, they are projections of what may happen in a worst-case scenario.\\" An otherwise unchanged version of Yellowhammer leaked earlier to The Times was titled \\"base case\\" scenario rather than the \\"reasonable worst case\\" scenario of the officially published document; a copy given to the Scottish government was titled \\"base scenario\\". The Sunday Times reported that Operation Yellowhammer was one of three scenarios being studied, the other two were Operation Kingfisher, involving a support package for distressed British businesses, and Operation Black Swan, a disaster scenario. Michael Gove characterised the report as inaccurate. Disclosure and naming The existence of the operation leaked on 6 September 2018, when a press photographer captured a snapshot of a document revealing some \\"no-deal\\" plans and the HM Treasury codename for them. The document appeared to indicate the CCS had been used in anticipation of government policy. No further details were revealed. The National Audit Office subsequently made public some documents about the operation. The operation code name \\"Yellowhammer\\", which relates to a small songbird, was chosen at random according to The Times. On 2 February 2019, The Times received leaked documents with this code name, about Department for Transport command and control structure plans. Activation plan Operation Yellowhammer covers actions to be taken in a no-deal scenario, some of which would be implemented prior to the date of leaving. On 29 January 2019 the House of Commons voted, in a non-binding ballot, to reject a no-deal Brexit. Unless the House of Commons were to accept the Brexit withdrawal agreement, or the EU's other members were to grant the UK an extension under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, or the UK were to revoke its Article 50 notice, the United Kingdom would by default have exited the EU on 29 March 2019 with no deal. On 20 March 2019, Kent County Council activated plans to keep roads, hospitals and schools open, and the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said that Operation Yellowhammer command and control structures would be \\"enacted fully\\" on 25 March 2019 unless a new exit date was agreed between the UK and the EU. On 21 March 2019, the Ministry of Defence staffed a bunker under its Whitehall headquarters to coordinate no-deal related military activities under Operation Redfold, and the COBRA emergency committee took control of no-deal planning with intentions to implement national contingency plans on 25 March 2019. Late on 21 March 2019, possible new exit dates were agreed between the UK and the EU: *22 May 2019 if the House of Commons approved the Brexit withdrawal agreement by 29 March 2019; or *12 April 2019 otherwise. Consequently, full activation of Operation Yellowhammer was postponed until 8 April 2019. On 10 April 2019 the European Council granted the UK a six-month extension; Yellowhammer's 6,000-strong civil service team was disbanded a few weeks afterwards, with most members returning to their usual activities. Developments since then with Theresa May resigning as leader of the Conservative Party and both candidates to replace her talking of leaving without a deal by the 31 October deadline may make it necessary to resume preparations. The Institute for Government said that the government may never be as ready for a no-deal Brexit as it was for the original departure date at the end of March. According to Joe Owen, the IfG's Brexit programme director, reinstating Yellowhammer and reinstating thousands of civil servants to implement no-deal contingency plans is a formidable task; everything will need to be \\"resurrected and restaffed, and earlier rounds of staff training will need to be repeated\\". According to the Financial Times and others, this is a sign that we have already run out of time. On Monday 21 October 2019, The Cabinet Office announced it had held an emergency Operation Yellowhammer Cabinet meeting on Sunday 20th 2019, \\"triggering\\" the plan, because it said there was no guarantee the EU would grant an extension. This followed the Prime Minister's compliance (on 19 October) with his obligation under the Benn Act to request an extension to Article 50 from the EU. Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat's Brexit spokesman said of the need for an extension, \\"if it is required, will be granted, leaving Yellowhammer nothing more than an expensive taxpayer-funded PR stunt.\\" The EU granted the requested extension a week later, on 28 October. =EU preparedness= The European Union issued a press release on 25 March 2019 indicating it had completed preparations for (what was then) an increasingly likely \\"no-deal\\" scenario on 12 April 2019. Possible activation in 2021 The transition period will end on 1 January 2021, the deadline for further extension having expired at the end of June 2020. There is no legal provision of a further extension; that would require new legislation in the UK and each member state. , there has been \\"little progress\\" towards a deal in principle, let alone a detailed text. Time required for ratification leaves late October as the latest possible date. At the end of the August 2020 round of negotiations, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, noting how little time remained, said that it \\"seems unlikely\\" that an agreement can be reached. Consequently, invocation of Yellowhammer in January 2021 must be equally likely. Organisation Operation Yellowhammer was developed by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, though COBRA took control on 25 March 2019. It will be organised via a Command and control structure (C3), which will co-ordinate: * Up to 30 UK Government departments :* If a Government department's contingency plans are inadequate Operation Yellowhammer will take over planning and decisions for that department. * Approximately 40 local resilience forums in England and Wales * Similar bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland * Governing authorities for the United Kingdom, overseas territories and crown dependencies * Co-ordination with impacted industries and sectors. Major decisions will be taken by the European Union Exit and Trade (Preparedness) Sub-Committee, set up in January 2019 and chaired by the prime minister. It will have wide-ranging powers to order emergency measures, including use of the military, and overriding regulations. =Relationships= The CCS may work with the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) to achieve an objective for Brexit work, with the DExEU concentrating on new policies, legislative changes and required funding changes with the CCS dealing with steps to mitigate and manage short-term disruption. An example objective would be Continuity of supply of medicines into the UK after no deal exit from the EU falling within the areas of risk of key goods crossing borders and transport systems. Arrangements for prioritisation of key goods, additional ferry capacity and having procedures in place for operation customs operations that are effective immediately from the Brexit date are some of the areas covered. Areas of risk Operation Yellowhammer identifies 12 areas of risk. These include the food and medicine supply chains and the status of UK citizens residing in the EU. There are also three risks common to all areas. The twelve areas of risk identified are: transport systems, people crossing borders, key goods crossing borders, healthcare services, UK energy and other critical systems, UK food and water supplies, UK nationals in the EU, law enforcement implications, banking and finance industry services, Brexit and the Irish border, specific risks to overseas territories and Crown dependencies (including the effect of Brexit on Gibraltar) and national security. Risks common to all areas identified are: legal, communications and data. Costs and resources In March 2019 the CCS had 56 people working internally on the programme; it is estimated 140 would be needed to maintain the operations centre and it has been budgeted to cost £1.1 million in 2018–2019. This is in the context of the UK Treasury allocating £1.5 billion for Brexit preparations by government departments in 2018–2019. 3,500 troops were placed on standby to 'assist the civil power' in the event of issues arising from a no-deal exit, although the Ministry of Defence had only disclosed their mission will be to \\"support government planning\\". Criticism On 21 March 2019, the UK government's decision to risk a no-deal Brexit and to invoke Operation Yellowhammer was criticised by the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon. Her sentiments were echoed by the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford. On 22 March confidential Cabinet documents on Operation Yellowhammer were obtained by The Guardian newspaper. The document warned that ministers could need to work 22.5-hour days, and departments would have to work 24 hours a day for at least twelve weeks without input from higher up in government. A source with knowledge of the operation said that, although planning had stepped up, the overall picture remained chaotic and \\"rudderless\\". August 2019 leak In mid-August 2019 an official cabinet Yellowhammer document from earlier that month was leaked. The paper gave base-case planning assumptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit which could lead to food, medicine and petrol shortages, with a hard border in the island of Ireland, and a \\"three-month meltdown\\" at ports unable to cope with extra checks. There could be protests requiring police action, and thousands of jobs could be lost as two oil refineries closed. Government ministers disputed the report and dismissed its warnings as \\"worst-case\\". The Sunday Times, according to The Observer, said that a senior Whitehall source said \\"This is not Project Fear, this is the most realistic assessment of what the public face with no deal. These are likely, basic, reasonable scenarios – not the worst case.\\" September 2019 publication A humble address was passed by the House of Commons on 9 September 2019 requiring the government \\"to lay before this House no later than 11.00pm Wednesday 11 September all the documents prepared within Her Majesty's Government since 23 July 2019 relating to operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee\\". In compliance, on 11 September the Government released a five-page document entitled \\"Operation Yellowhammer: HMG Reasonable Worst Case Planning Assumptions as of 2 August 2019\\".Latest Yellowhammer Planning Assumptions Other than a change of title – from \\"Base Scenario\\" to \\"Reasonable Worst Case Planning Assumptions\\" – and one redacted paragraph reportedly dealing with the impact on the oil refining industry, the document was essentially identical to the one leaked in August. The document was the subject of a two-hour long \\"Brexit readiness and Operation Yellowhammer\\" Ministerial statement and debate led by Michael Gove on 25 September, the day Parliament resumed session after the Supreme Court failed the prorogation attempted by Boris Johnson. During the debate the opposition focused on the modification of the title, from \\"Base case\\" to \\"Worst case\\". The petrol tariff was revealed by opposition members to be zero, and there was some concern expressed by Adrian Bailey and Melanie Onn about job losses at uncompetitive UK plant.

The facility has the capability to generate 960 net megawatts of capacity and can produce electricity for more than 700,000 homes. It was developed and financed in direct response to the robust wholesale price signal provided by PJM Interconnections's capacity and energy markets. The OCEC uses two Siemens SGT6-8000H gas turbines and one steam turbine, currently the most advanced on the market. Designed to be the most efficient generating facility in the mid-Atlantic power markets, OCEC emits 90% less sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and fine particulate matter than coal-fired power plants; as well as 50% less carbon dioxide and 33% less water than traditional coal plants of the same size.  Development  In April 2012, CME Energy LLC partnered with Pure Energy to form the development company, North America Project Development, LLC (NAPD), in order to build the OCEC. CME Energy and NAPD then partnered with global asset manager Ares Management, L.P.'s energy-focused private equity arm, Ares Energy Investment Funds (EIF), as the project's initial equity provider. Later, independent global infrastructure investment manager I Squared Capital joined as a co-investor and owner in the project. The project reached financial close on November 14, 2014. On November 17, 2014, Ares EIF and I Squared Capital announced that the two companies had formed an equity partnership to construct the OCEC. Their investment totaled $800 million, with each firm investing $400 million. Ares EIF engaged in the project specifically through one of its private equity funds, EIF United States Power Fun IV, L.P. (USPF IV), and I Squared Capital engaged through its ISQ Global Infrastructure Fund. CME, through NAPD, remains a minority-owner of the plant today.  Construction  Following the plant's approval from the Ohio Power Sitting Board in May 2013, Black & Veatch, a global engineering, construction, procurement and consulting firm, began construction of the OCEC on November 17, 2014. The plant was built with over 25,000 cubic yards of concrete and over 3,700 tons of structural steel. At its peak period in the spring of 2016, construction of the project supported more than 900 on-site jobs. Additionally, construction of the OCED created approximately 450 indirect jobs in Lucas County and approximately 350 indirect jobs across Ohio. Construction of the plant was completed in June 2017, and it officially opened in August 2017. The opening was celebrated with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at which Ohio Governor John Kasich, accompanied by several state and local officials, toured the plant and spoke about the significance of this development for Ohio.  Economic Impact  The facility's construction and its first 20 years of operations are projected to contribute more than $800 million to Ohio, Lucas County and the City of Oregon's economy. The total economic impact of the facility's construction in Lucas County is $362 million, with an additional economic impact of $50 million across the state. Additionally, approximately 50 permanent jobs will be created by the OCEC's operation, which will provide an additional $20 million of economic impact in Ohio. Oregon local schools are also projected to receive millions of dollars in new tax revenues from the OCEC's operations. The region has already realized improvements to local infrastructure, including water system upgrades and installation of natural gas pipelines.

Both were captured and sold into slavery by English traders while the King of Old Town, Grandy King George, Little Ephraim's brother and Ancona's uncle, was negotiating trade with the Duke of New Town. The Robin Johns were deceived twice by ship captains promising to bring them home to Africa. Upon the second time the two were in England, where they petitioned the court system for their freedom. The two men belonged to an ethnic group called the Efik and were seen as valuable assets because of their intelligence: they spoke multiple languages (including English), were literate, could negotiate, and had a strong knowledge of the inner workings of the slave trade.  Attack and capture  By the mid 1700s a bitter rivalry had formed between Old Town and New Town in Old Calabar. In 1767 trade negotiations between Grandy King George and Duke Ephraim of New Town turned bitter, which stalled the typical slave-trading operation. New Town's slave traders then recruited the help of British ship captains to ambush those involved in the slave trade in Old Town, during which hundreds of men were slaughtered and hundreds of men enslaved. While the city was focused on the ambush, a British captain was able to capture Little Ephraim and Ancona.  Captivity  = Dominica = Once captured, their odyssey began on Captain Bivins ship the Duke of York which set sail for Dominica in the Caribbean. The pair were sold together to a French physician, which scholar Randy Sparks states was extremely uncommon. After being on the island less than a year, Captain William Sharp of Liverpool on one of his regular trips to the island discovered the two Robin Johns. He promised to return both Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John back to Africa if they could make it to his ship before he left. In one of the letters that the Robin Johns sent the pair stated that they were \\"determined to get home\\". Escaping at night, both Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John were able to make it to Captain William Sharp's ship. Once there, they discovered that they had been tricked, as Captain William Smith had no intention of sailing to Africa. He instead sailed up the coast of North America and docked in Virginia where the Robin Johns were once again sold. = Virginia = Once in Virginia, Captain William Sharp sold Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John to John Thompson of Williamsburg, Virginia. John Thompson was a trader and often took the Robin Johns to sea with him. He was a man with a temper and often beat the Robin Johns. In March 1772, John Thompson died. Shortly after Thompson's death, Captain Terence O'Neil sailed the Greyhound into Virginia. O'Neil had previously sailed from England to Old Calabar, where he picked up 132 slaves to transport to South Carolina. After delivering the slaves O'Neil sailed to Virginia where two of his sailors, who were from Old Town, recognized the Robin Johns. Aware of the details of the ambush where they were captured, these sailors urged Captain O'Neil to take action. Captain O'Neil offered the Robin Johns a trip home if they could escape at night and board his ship. Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John were able to escape and board the Greyhound, which was headed to Bristol, England, a major slave-trading post. = England = Upon arriving in England O'Neil transferred the Robin Johns to another ship that was headed back to Virginia, with plans to sell them again. The Robin Johns spent two weeks locked in a ship before they sent a letter to the prominent slave trader Thomas Jones, who knew the Robin Johns personally, as he had made many trips to Old Calabar in the 1760s. Jones had formed close relationships with the ruling family of Old Town. Immediately after the ambush Grandy King George had written to Thomas Jones, asking for his help with bringing his brother and nephew home.  Court case in England  Through Thomas Jones, the Robin Johns petitioned for their freedom. Jones used the 1772 ruling on the James Somerset case, attempting to use Habeas Corpus to free the Robin Johns. A judge ruled that the Robin Johns were free and could not be returned to America to be sold again. After being declared free, the two traveled back to Calabur.  Later life  While in Bristol the Robin Johns interacted with Charles Wesley and converted to Methodism.

Early life  Nagiyev was born on January 26, 1958 in Angarsk in a family from Dagestan, or according to other sources, they were Ingush or Kazakhs.Постой, паровоз, или Маньяк в лифчике Subsequently, the family with three children moved to the Kursk Oblast and settled in the city of Sudzha.Преступления и наказание курского маньяка Nagiyev actively engaged in sports, primarily athletic gymnastics, but was very aggressive since childhood. He had problems with girls, with some claiming they did not pay attention to him due to his small height of 1,57 meters. Between May and June 1975 he committed 3 rapes, and was sentenced to 6 years in prison, which he served in the Komi ASSR. In 1978, he was released on parole for his good behaviour.  Murders  After his release he worked in the village of Chikshino in the Pechora region of the Komi ASSR. On January 30, 1979, in the city of Pechora, he raped and killed an accidental acquaintance named Olga Demyanenko in her apartment. On May 28, he raped and killed a train passenger named Daria Kravchenko, who was going to Pechora, taking advantage of the fact that the car was almost empty. The body was hidden in the luggage compartment under the seats. According to some accounts, the victim was killed because she resembled Alla Pugacheva. Nagiyev soon returned to Kursk, where he got a job as a projectionist of a mobile cinema installation. The working conditions allowed him to spend a lot of time outside his permanent home. On July 4, 1980, in a half-empty car on the train \\"Moscow-Kharkiv\\", he raped and killed 4 women - two conductors (Derevyanko and Zizyulina) and two passengers (Maria Lopatkina and Tatiana Kolesnikova). The victims' bodies were then thrown out of the window in the Oryol area between the stations \\"Stalnoi Kon\\" and \\"Stanovoi Kolodez\\". In addition, from November 1979 to September 1980, he committed more than 30 rapes in various settlements of the USSR.  Arrest, trial and execution  On the day of the last murders, Nagiyev, with traces of blood on his clothes and a knife in his hand, noticed the train electrician, but did not kill him. The detectives made a detailed list of the things that he had taken from his victims, and the jewelry's descriptions were sent to pawnshops and jewelry stores in several cities of the USSR. Nagiyev gave one such jewelry to an acquaintance, and when he came with a ring into a jewelry store in Kursk, he was identified. The acquaintance then told authorities who had given him the ring. The house of Nagiyev's mother was searched, during which his notebook with various addresses in various settlements of the USSR was found. On September 12, 1980, Nagiyev was arrested in Dnipro. He was originally sent to a detention center in Oryol, but after a few months he tried to escape, tearing off his handcuffs and headbutting the guards, but was ultimately detained. Soon he was transferred to the Kursk SIZO for more intensive protection. After this, Nagiyev began to admit to his crimes, including those he was initially not aware of, for example, the two murders. It was also suggested that he committed more murders than he confessed to. In addition, while serving time, Nagiyev said that he wanted to kill Alla Pugacheva, and for this reason traveled several times to Moscow. On July 2, 1981, Nagiyev was sentenced to death by the Kursk Regional Court, and was to be executed by firing squad. In early August 1981, it was reported that Nagiyev had been transferred to the Novocherkassk prison so his death penalty could be carried out. On August 19, on his arrival in Novocherkassk, he managed to escape by slipping past a passing train. The then Minister of Interior Affairs, Nikolai Shchelokov, expected the maniac to be captured in three weeks, but he was caught after two months. Nagiyev was hiding in one of the farms near Novocherkassk under the guise of being a gypsy, where he aroused suspicion by local residents, who alerted the police. On September 29, 1981, he was rearrested, which he actively resisted, suffering several bullet wounds as a result. The doctors were hardly able to heal his wounds, and on October 28, 1981, he was executed in the Novocherkassk prison.

The screenplay was written by Cummings based upon the story \\"God of Her People\\" by James Oliver Curwood, and directed by Cummings. The picture was notably the first of many (including a subsequent television series) for canine character Rin Tin Tin, who replaced a truculent wolf originally slated to appear. The movie exists and is readily available online. The Man from Hell's River was produced by Irving Cummings Productions. Plot As described in a film magazine, taking place in the woods of the Canadian northwest, Corporal Pierre de Barre (Cummings) loves Mabella (Novak), the foster daughter of Lopente (Klein), and she loves him. Gaspard, The Wolf (Beery), holding over Lopente knowledge of a killing for which he would be arrested, demands Mabella. Lopente forces the young woman to marry Gaspard, telling her that he would be arrested and hung otherwise. She does not tell Corporal Pierre why this happened, and he cannot fathom her reasons. Gaspard returns to seeing the women of doubtful virtue which formerly held his attentions. This irritates Pierre but he cannot do anything. The Priest tells Pierre of Mabella's story, and that she is not really Lopente's daughter. Mabella arouses Gaspard's jealousy and he sets out to kill Pierre. Sergeant McKenna (Whitson) and his deputy leave the post deserted, and Gaspard arrives and knocks Pierre down. Gaspard then flees with his wife. Pierre follows, and he and Gaspard have a fight out on the snow covered mountain. Pierre's wolf dog (Rin Tin Tin) breaks his bounds and jumps, landing on Gaspard and knocking him over the cliff. Pierre and Mabella are now free to marry.

Julie Dahey was a member of the class of Gens de couleur or free colours in Saint- Domingue. In 1767, following a common custom in Saint-Domingue, she became the professional mistress of the wealthy white sugar planter Sieur Thomas Peignanan, with the title menagere or housekeeper, with whom she had seven children. After the Seven Years' War, it became common from White Frenchmen to move temporarily to the colony of Saint-Domingue to make a fortune before they returned to France; while there, they did not marry within the White French planter aristocracy but instead lived in placage with a free woman of color, to whom they left land, slaves, business and property when they returned to France or died. This created a significant business class of rich free people of colors in Saint-Domingue, among whom Nanette Pincemaille (d. 1784), Anne Laporte (d. 1783) and Julie Dahey belonged to the most notable examples. Julie Dahey managed a coffee plantation from 1779, and a pottery- and brick factory in Croix des Bouquets in companionship with Sieur La Bacheliere. In 1781, she rented land from the crown on favorable terms and founded a sugar plantation with the right to buy it when the contract expired twelve years later. In 1782, Peignanan wrote a will in which Dahey was given his personal property and his sister Catherine was given the ownership of his plantation on the condition that she rented it to Julie Dahey; she was further granted 12000 livres and her seven children three of his slaves each. Julie Dahey, alongside Zabeau Bellanton, thus belonged to the leading figures of Gens de couleur businesspeople on Saint-Domingue prior to the Haitian Revolution. References * Stewart R.

Trisilaallene is a silicon-based analog of an allene, but their chemical properties are markedly different.  Synthesis  The first isolable trisilaallene compound was reported by Kira et al. in 2003, synthesized by reductive dehalogenation of tetrachlorosilane using potassium graphite. This tetraalkyl-substituted trisilallene showed thermal stability up to its melting point around 200 ºC, but decomposed in contact with air. Its remarkable stability is attributable to bulky substituents providing kinetic protection at the terminal silicon atoms. The 29Si-NMR shifts of the central silicon and terminal silicon atoms were observed at 157.0 ppm and 196.9 ppm respectively. Two Si=Si bond lengths were determined to be 2.177 Å and 2.188 Å by X-ray crystallography, which are within the typical range of Si=Si double bonds. 660x660px Sekiguchi et al. synthesized a silyl-substituted trisilaallene from a reaction between a N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adduct of SiCl2 and 1,1-dilithiosilane (t-Bu2MeSi)2SiLi2. Although crystallographic analysis of the product was not successful, the formation of trisilaallene was confirmed by 1H-, 13C-, and 29Si-NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and reactivity study. The low electronegativity of silyl substituents compared to alkyl substituents resulted in a more upfield 29Si-NMR shift for the terminal silicon atoms (44.6 ppm) and a downfield shift for the central atom (418.5 ppm). 660x660px  Structure and bonding  = Geometry = 660x660px In contrast to its linear carbon analog, trisilaallene is characterized by bent geometry. For example, Kira's trisilaallene had a Si=Si=Si bond angle of 136.5º. While the bulky and electropositive silyl ( tBu2MeSi-) substituents widened the bond angle to 164.3º (calcd.), no linear trisilaallene has been reported yet. The two planes that each terminal silicon atom and attached substituents lie on tend to be perpendicular to each other, which is analogous with allene. The central silicon atom shows fluxional behavior in that its relative position varies with respect to the substituents planes, and the distribution of resultant isomers depends on the temperature. The bent structure of trisilaallene is explained by the second-order Jahn-Teller distortion. Unlike the 2s and 2p orbitals of carbon, where the orbital radii of maximum electron density are similar, the 3s orbital of silicon is significantly smaller than 3p orbitals (rnp– rns= -0.2 pm for n = 2 and > 20 pm for n > 2). Therefore, the σ-overlap between the 3s orbital of the central silicon atom and a set of 3pz oribtals of the terminal atoms (when z-axis is the molecular axis) is poor compared to in allene, resulting in a relatively low-lying σ*-orbital. The energy gap between σ*-orbital and π-orbitals originated from 3px and 3py orbitals is small enough to induce considerable mixing between the σ*-orbital and one of the π-orbitals with appropriate symmetry. This orbital mixing removes degeneracy between the two π-orbitals, accompanied by geometric distortion. The ab initio and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that Si3R4 molecules with smaller substituents (R = H or Me) adopt zwitterionic structures with C2v or Cs symmetry and with drastically smaller bond angles (~70º for R = H, ~90º for R = Me). However, the steric congestion required for isolation prevent these highly bent structures. = Frontier Molecular Orbitals = 330x330px DFT calculation at B3LYP/6-31+G(d, p) level suggests that the frontier molecular orbitals of the tetraalkyl-substituted trisilaallene are markedly different from those of allene. The calculation was performed on a model trisilaallene compound with methyl substituents and the experimentally observed bond angle from Kira's compound (136.5º). According to the calculation, the alkyl- substituted trisilaallene has nondegenerate HOMO-1 and HOMO based on π-interaction and also nondegenerate LUMO and LUMO+1 based on π*-interaction, as a direct result of Jahn-Teller distortion. These orbitals correspond to in- plane and out-of-plane twisted overlaps of p-orbitals, which are delocalized over the Si=Si=Si unit. These frontier orbitals make a striking contrast to those of all-carbon allenes, whose frontier orbitals consist of degenerate pairs of π-bonding orbitals (HOMO) and π*-antibonding orbitals (LUMO) localized between two carbons.330x330px The electronic structure of trisilaallene is highly affected by its substituents. On the contrary to the alkyl-substituted trisilaallene, according to DFT calculation at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, tBu2MeSi-substituted trisilaallene has almost degenerate π (Si=Si) and π* (Si=Si) orbitals, localized between the central silicon atom and only one of the two terminal silicon atoms. The two π-bonding orbitals and the two π*-antibonding orbitals are perpendicular to each other. These features are analogous to all-carbon allenes, which is justified by the close- to-linear geometry of the silyl-substituted trisilaallene.  Reactivity  = Alcohol addition = 660x660px Trisilaallene readily reacts with alcohol to generate dialkoxytrisilane. The regioselectivity of the alcohol addition reaction depends on the type of substituents. In 2007, Kira et al. reported that the alkyl-substituted trisilaallene gives rise to 1,3-dialkoxytrisilane in the presence of excess ROH (R = H, Me, Et). Larger alcohols such as isopropanol and tert-butanol did not react due to the steric congestion arising from the bulky substituents of trisilaallene. In contrast, two methoxy groups were added to the central silicon atom of the silyl-substituted trisilaallene from the reaction with methanol. 440x440px The different regioselectivity between the alkyl-substituted trisilaallene and the silyl- substituted trisilaallene is explained by charge distribution within Si=Si=Si unit. Calculation at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level for the methyl-substituted trisilaallene predicted >Siδ+=Siδ-=Siδ+< charge distribution with -0.408 on the central atom and +1.016 / +1.026 on the terminal atoms. Therefore, the nucleophilic addition of alcohol occurs at the terminal atoms. This charge distribution is in accordance with the frontier molecular orbitals of the alkyl-substituted trisilaallene. HOMO-1 and HOMO have the largest orbital coefficient on the central atom, while LUMO and LUMO+1 have larger coefficients on the terminal two. On the other hand, the silyl-substituted trisilaallene is expected to have greater negative charges on the terminal atoms (-0.36 / -0.37) than on the central atom (-0.08), calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. = Miscellaneous = 660x660px Reactions of trisilaallene with haloalkanes generate halogenated silane products. Treating trisilaallene with methyl iodide breaks the Si=Si double bonds, yielding two molecules of iodo(methyl)silane. Meanwhile, the reaction of trisilaallene with tetrachloromethane gives rise to the complete chlorination of the two Si=Si bonds without bond breaking, yielding tetrachlorotrisilane. 660x660px Trisilaallene also reacts with acetone to form a strained bicyclic adduct, whose structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. This reaction is supposed to be initiated by an ene reaction of one of the Si=Si double bond with acetone, followed by [2 + 2] cycloaddition of the other Si=Si bond and a C=C bond to give the product. 660x660px The silyl-substituted trisilaallene goes through thermal rearrangement when heated to 120 ºC in benzene. The resultant isomer, tetrakis(di-tert-butylmethylsilyl)cyclotrisilene, was calculated to be thermodynamically more stable than the parent trisilaallene compound by 10.5 kcal/mol.

The story follows the efforts of Pentagon staffer Scott Huffman and many veterans to see the Medal of Honor awarded to William H. Pitsenbarger, a United States Air Force Pararescueman who flew in helicopter rescue missions during the Vietnam War to aid downed soldiers and pilots. The film stars Sebastian Stan, Christopher Plummer, William Hurt, Ed Harris, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Irvine, and Peter Fonda, in his final film role. Production began in the United States in March 2017, and the film premiered in October 2019 in Westhampton Beach, New York. It was released in the United States by Roadside Attractions on January 24, 2020, and grossed $3 million against a $20 million budget. The film's title is taken from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, where Lincoln honored the fallen, saying that they \\"gave the last full measure of devotion.\\" Plot The true story of Vietnam War hero William H. Pitsenbarger (Jeremy Irvine), a U.S. Air Force Pararescueman (also known as a PJ) who personally saved over sixty men. During a rescue mission on April 11, 1966, Pits (as he was called) willingly chose to leave the relative safety of his rescue helicopter to aid people on the ground when he saw how bad the situation below was. When others in his team declined to go, he put himself at risk to do more to help his fellow Americans. After saving many already, he was ordered to take the chance to escape on the last helicopter out of a combat zone heavily under fire, but he stayed behind to save and defend the lives of soldiers of the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, before making the ultimate sacrifice in one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Thirty-two years later, Pentagon staffer Scott Huffman (Sebastian Stan), on a career fast-track, is reluctantly tasked with investigating a Medal of Honor request for Pitsenbarger made by his best friend and partner on the mission (William Hurt) and his parents (Christopher Plummer and Diane Ladd). Huffman seeks out the testimony of Army veterans who witnessed or were saved by Pitsenbarger’s extraordinary valor, including Takoda (Samuel L. Jackson), Burr (Peter Fonda) and Mott (Ed Harris) and Pitsenbarger's parents. Many of them carry their own demons from their experiences and trauma of that day and the war in Vietnam. But as Huffman learns more about Pitsenbarger’s courageous acts, he uncovers a high-level conspiracy behind the decades-long denial of the medal, prompting him to put his own career on the line to seek justice for the fallen airman. Throughout the film in multiple flashback scenes, the Vietcong ambush of Army soldiers as they fight and die in the Vietnam jungle is shown in graphic realism. The attack is known as Operation Abilene. Young soldiers play Tulley (Ethan Russell), Takoda (Ser'Darius Blain), Burr (James Jagger), Mott (Zach Roerig), Kepper (Cody Walker), Holt (Richard Cawthorne), and Pitsenbarger as they fight. One sees the heroic service of airman Pitsenbarger as he drops into the firefight from a helicopter and goes to work as a medic. He waves off the helicopter, picks up a gun and starts to fight with his fellow comrades. Saving many, he dies a hero. The film also details the PTSD effect on each of the now old surviving veterans of the Vietnam War. When a Senate effort on the floor of Congress fails, Huffman goes public with the story and ultimately a Medal of Honor is awarded to Pitsenbarger. At the awards ceremony Mott delivers Pitsenbarger's last letter to the woman he loved. The airman's cancer ridden father and mother are in attendance as their son's duty, courage and sacrifice is recounted. The Air Force Secretary presents the Medal of Honor to the parents and then recognizes all in attendance. The epilogue points out that of the millions of veterans that have served their country, only 3,489 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Cast Production It took nearly 20 years to make the movie. Todd Robinson first learned about the William H. Pitsenbarger story while doing research for another movie in 1999. The story intrigued Robinson for several reasons, including Pitsenbarger's award of the Air Force Cross rather than the Medal of Honor. Robinson and Executive Producer Sidney Sherman pitched the film idea to more than 50 production companies but none of them were interested in making the movie. Robinson decided to write the script without funding or a studio commitment. After finishing the script Robinson and Sherman continued to search for a studio. New Line Cinema won the deal in 2007, but not long after, New Line was sold to Warner Bros. and the project was canceled. Robinson and Sherman were again without a backer. Over the course of the next decade, they lined up funding and kicked off production in 2017. It was announced in May 2016 that Scott Eastwood and Ed Harris had been cast in the film, with Laurence Fishburne and Morgan Freeman in negotiations. By March 2017, Eastwood was no longer involved, and the film added Samuel L. Jackson, Sebastian Stan, Christopher Plummer, William Hurt, Bradley Whitford, Michael Imperioli, Linus Roache, John Savage and Diane Ladd to its cast. Filming was set to begin between Atlanta and Costa Rica later that month. Grant Gustin and LisaGay Hamilton were cast as production commenced, with Amy Madigan and Peter Fonda joining in April. The film was dedicated in memory of Peter Fonda. In August 2017, filming concluded in Atlanta and would move to Thailand, with Jeremy Irvine (replacing Gustin in his role), Ethan Russell, Ser'Darius Blain, Cody Walker, Julian Adams, Tommy Hatto and Zach Roerig cast in the film. Release Roadside Attractions acquired the distribution rights to the film in September 2018, with a wide release in 2019 planned. The film premiered at a special free screening for veterans in Westhampton Beach, New York on October 19, 2019, and was released in the United States on January 24, 2020. Home media Lionsgate released the film digitally on April 7, 2020, and on DVD, Blu-ray and video on demand on April 21, 2020. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Last Full Measure holds an approval rating of 60% based on 63 critics, with an average rating of 6.21/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"The Last Full Measure struggles to capture the incidents that inspired it, but ultimately prevails thanks to strong performances in service of a remarkable true story.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" References External links * 2019 films 2019 drama films 2019 war drama films American war drama films American films Films about the United States Air Force Films about United States special operations forces Films about veterans Films set in 1966 Films set in 1999 Films set in 2000 Films set in Ohio Films set in Vietnam Films set in Washington, D.C.

It is a remake of Epyx's 1989 Atari Lynx title of the same name and was, alongside Vid Grid, one of the pack-in games for the peripheral when it launched. Assuming the role of a rookie aircraft pilot from the Blue Lightning squadron, players take control of multiple military aircraft on various missions in order to stop General Drako, who betrayed the United Nations and slowly gained control of many armed forces through corruption to expand his organized crime empire on all over the world. Originally advertised as a sequel to the Atari Lynx original, Blue Lightning had a troubled development cycle and went through various changes before release. Similarly with Cybermorph, an early game for the Jaguar created by its main developer, Blue Lightning received divisive reviews when it launched. While it received praise for its soundtrack, many reviewers felt divided in regards to the gameplay and graphics. Critics also compared the game with both the original Lynx game and After Burner, which received a conversion for the Sega 32X months prior.  Gameplay  From top to bottom, the game's interface displays the player's total score, remaining missiles and special weapons, damage meter and level progress indicator, while a directional arrow is displayed during escort missions at the top middle. Blue Lightning is an arcade-style combat flight simulation game that is played from a third-person perspective, similar to the Atari Lynx original and After Burner, where players take the role of a fighter pilot with the main objective of completing a group of missions across multiple locations in order to defeat General Drako and his army from controlling the world. While it retains the 2D graphics from the original game, they are now featured with digitized backgrounds and pre- rendered sprites. When starting the game, players can select any save slot on the \\"Pilot Select\\" screen in order to keep their progress through the game and customize it by choosing their preferred portrait picture, enter their name and select any of the three levels of difficulty available. If a Memory Track cartridge is present, progress and high-scores will be automatically saved after completing a location, otherwise players can play through the game without saving. By pressing Option on the main menu screen, players can access to the options screen and change the default settings such as disabling cutscenes and language. Once the player is ready, they are tasked on completing training missions in order to be prepared for the main missions of the game, which are named \\"Tour of Duty\\".Blue Lightning game manual (Atari Jaguar CD, US) After completing the training missions, players can now select any of the seven Tour areas freely, in addition to being awarded with three extra fighter aircraft, instead of having only one as with the original game and these planes also act as lives and if all of them are crashed or destroyed, the game is over though extra planes can be obtained by either reaching a certain score or completing the missions. Before starting the mission, a briefing screen is shown which explains the situation in the selected Tour location and lists the objective for each of the four missions on the selected area, as well as selecting and set up their fighter plane, with each plane having their own advantages and disadvantages. There are five types of assignments to be found through the game, such as escort, aerial and ground missions. Though players can finish the game normally, only the fake ending is shown and in order to see the real ending, a cheat code must be entered at the options screen.  Plot  General Drako was a notable man who worked for the United Nations by using the organization's military personnel to keep peace around the world. However, Drako slowly gained control and power of the military organizations, corrupting them on his favor to the point that members from the Blue Lightning squadron joined Drako's corrupted ranks in exchange for power and wealth, stretching his organized crime network across the globe by the time his betrayal was unveiled. Leaders from the U.N. were surprised from this and actions had to be taken before it was too late, with remaining loyal forces of the organization eager for a chance to stop Drako and his forces. As a result, the organization turns its head to the Blue Lightning squadron and they assign a rookie pilot of the force in order to put an end to Drako and his criminal group. After taking on multiple assignments, the pilot is sent to the Arctic where most of Drako's army resides, but Drako himself escapes after the destruction of his base. When the pilot arrives to the squadron's base after completion of the mission, the remaining forces of Drako approaches to the base for a surprise assault with attack aircraft and as a result, the pilot is sent once more to complete the task in order to pinpoint his secret base. Once his location is revealed, the pilot is sent to the secret base where Drako and his forces are escaping. After managing to get close with Drako and his aircraft, the pilot defeats him, saving the world in the process and later honored for his merits.  Development  Being one of the first titles announced for the Atari Jaguar CD, Blue Lightning went through a troubled development cycle in order to coincide with the release of the add-on. The game was originally announced in early 1994 as Blue Lightning 2, a sequel to the original Blue Lightning on the Atari Lynx and became one of the first titles announced for the then-upcoming Jaguar CD add-on. During Autumn ECTS '94 it was revealed that Attention to Detail, who previously developed Cybermorph for the Jaguar, were the ones developing the title under its final name. It was showcased at SCES '94 in a very early state, featuring different graphics compared to the final release. It was later showcased during WCES '95, Spring ECTS '95 and E3 1995 respectively, in addition to being playable for the magazine press that were invited to Atari Corporation's UK division. Blue Lighting went through a troubled development cycle until it was released. Kristi-Louise Herd, who previously worked at Imagitec Design on conversions such as Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun, worked as one of the graphic artists for the title at Attention to Detail after leaving Imagitec. Referring the game's development process as \\"the one which gave me the most headaches\\", Kristi states that the graphics for the backgrounds were digitized from images created by ATD, while sprites were produced from pre-rendered 3D models but this caused a discontent for her with both the project and company, calling the scanned backgrounds as \\"awful\\" and left the company as a result. She also stated that the company hired both an aircraft and a flight suit for a photo shoot, where developers of the game dressed as fighter pilots and used photos from the session as portraits for the pilot selection screen, with Kristi herself stating that it \\"was the best time I had at ATD.\\" Kristi has also referred Blue Lightning as one of the titles she would like to rework. Fred Gill, best known as one of the programmers for Cybermorph, worked on additional support during the development process of the Blue Lightning. He states that him and the team underestimated how much work the project would bring to them, while the company was expanding into multiple teams as well as not understanding how the gameplay from the original worked when recreating it for the Jaguar. He also stated that the team had many problems when developing the game at the same time the Jaguar CD hardware was being finished. Carrie Tahquechi, wife of ex-Atari producer Ted Tahquechi and the female voice in Tempest 2000, did the voice work for some of the radio transmissions heard during gameplay at Atari's sound department. In addition, the narration, menu and most of the voice work for the title was done by comedian actor Rob Brydon, who also did voice work for Battlemorph.  Reception  Blue Lightning received divisive reviews from critics when it launched. Next Generation reviewed the Jaguar version of the game, and stated that \\"You might not expect much from a game that was originally released over five years ago, but Blue Lightning was a great game when it was released for the Lynx, and it's still a good one now.\\"  References   External links  Blue Lightning at AtariAge * Blue Lightning at GameFAQs * Blue Lightning at MobyGames 1995 video games Atari games Atari Jaguar CD games Atari Jaguar-only games Attention to Detail games Flight simulation video games Pack-in video games Rail shooters Single-player video games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video game remakes Video games set in Australia Video games set in Europe Video games set in North America Video games set in South Africa Video games set in South America Video games set in Russia Video games with alternate endings Video games with digitized sprites ","title":"Blue Lightning (1995 video game)"},{"id":"58418652","text":"The following is a list of mayors of the city of Recife, Brazil. * , 1891 * Francisco do Rego Barros Lacerda, 1891-1892 * Manuel Pinto Damaso, 1892-1893 * , 1893-1896 * , 1896-1899 * Luiz Cavalcanti de Almeida, 1899 * Esmeraldino Olímpio de Torres Bandeira, 1899 * Manuel dos Santos Moreira, 1899-1905 * Martins de Barros, 1905-1908 * , 1908-1911 * Eudoro Correia, 1911-1915 * Marco Antônio de Morais Rego, 1915-1918 * Lima Castro, 1918-1922 * Antônio Ribeiro Pessoa, 1922 * , 1922-1925, 1931-1934 * Alfredo Osório de Cerqueira, 1925-1926 * , 1926-1928 * Francisco da Costa Maia, 1928-1930 * Lauro Borba, 1930-1931 * João Pereira Borges, 1934-1937 * , 1937-1945 * José dos Anjos, 1945-1946 * , 1946, 1955-1960, 1963-1964 * Clóvis de Castro, 1946-1947 * Antônio Alves Pereira, 1947-1948 * Manuel César de Morais Rego, 1948-1951 * Antônio A.

This is the first episode of the thirtieth season and 640th episode of the series. In this episode, the son Bart Simpson fakes a miracle cure and is then approached by a Christian filmmaker who wants to make an adaptation of the event and Bart is wracked with guilt at having lied. This episode won the Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 71st Writers Guild of America Awards. Plot At a school assembly while Lisa plays the saxophone Bart gets dared by Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney to pull the fire alarm, but he declines, thinking of Lisa. The following day, Marge is proud of him, but Homer and Grampa tell him to take a dare like a man. At Echo Canyon, Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney dare him to jump off the dam, which Bart does ending face first on concrete. At Springfield General Hospital, Bart wakes up and in order to not disappoint Marge, he lies that he saw Heaven. Despite Lisa's warnings, Bart keeps telling lies about what Heaven is like and becomes popular. Christian movie producers come to the house to present Homer and Bart the opportunity to make a movie about his experience. Bart forces Homer and Ned Flanders to work together on the movie, including holding hands. To cast the movie, they interview Emily Deschanel to play Marge, and Gal Gadot for the role of Lisa. The movie starts filming, but Bart's guilt is mounting and he is having nightmares. He ends up in Heaven in a nightmare, where he meets Grandpa Bouvier who scolds him, and Jesus Christ who pummels his face. The movie, \\"Bart's Not Dead\\", finally premieres, including a group song, “One More Chance”. At home at bedtime, Bart confesses it was all a lie to which Homer feigns surprise. Just as Marge is absorbing the news, Lisa announces the movie is a hit making over $100 million at the box office. Marge insists they have to confess, and at a press conference Homer and Ned give the profits to charity and all is forgiven. At night, Lisa, to console the remorseful Bart, joins him on their home's roof. Some shingles come loose and they both fall to the ground luckily landing in a pile of leaves swept by Homer, which they attribute as the true miracle. Several years later, Bart arrives in Heaven and meets up with Homer, who encourages him to meet with Jesus before he himself flees to Hindu Heaven just to ask Krishna to send him back to Earth. He is then offered the choice of being reincarnated as a turtle or a pharmaceutical CEO and promptly chooses the turtle. Production On her Twitter account, Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who guest starred as herself on this episode, described The Simpsons as \\"a huge part of my childhood” and also stated that \\"it's so cool that I get to be a part of the Simpsons.\\" Gadot, who was announced as guest star in February 2018, did a hot dog handout in this episode which was similar to one she did at 2018 Academy Awards. There is a brief reference to Barack Obama;in the scene taking place outside the hospital, there is a sign that says \\"OBAMACARE IS ALIVE\\". Reception \\"Bart's Not Dead\\" scored a 1.4 rating with a 5 share and was watched by 3.24 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B− ranking, stating \\" 'Bart’s Not Dead', (credited to Stephanie Gillis) aims for a more character-driven return. Sure, Bart, Homer, and Flanders wind up making a Christian-themed movie that winds up making $100 million, but the heart of the episode is, well, heart.” Jesse Schdeen of IGN gave the episode a 7.2 out of 10 points ranking, stating \\" 'Bart's Not Dead' stands as one of the better season premieres for The Simpsons in recent years, mostly because it settles for telling a clever, amusing story rather than relying on gimmicks. It doesn't take full advantage of its premise, but this episode still delivers some scathing satire of for- profit religious movies and a strong take on Bart's relationships with Homer and Lisa. Hopefully this episode is a sign of things to come for Season 30.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3 out of 5 points ranking, stating \\" 'Bart's Not Dead' isn't quite a classic episode, but it has all the classical elements. At the center of the piece is a fight over Bart's soul. He may worship the devil in public, but when no one is looking, or in this case when everyone is looking, Bart will always side with his mother and sister. And the Fox network brass because they couldn't have him going entirely over to the dark side. That's Homer territory. The film-within-the-episode skewers the righteous tinkering of facts, while raising the suspense on why Bart and Homer shouldn't get away with this. Bart, played by Jonathan Groff in the Christian film, doth protest too much, and far too specifically. It sounds like the movie is already a whitewashed version of something in need of fresh paint. The episode bodes fairly well for season 30 because, even though The Simpsons has covered this subject a few times, they show they are not going to ease up on casual blasphemy. After thirty years, the series has become the authority. Newer shows are taking on new ground, but The Simpsons are still shooting for something less than redemption. Bart begins the episode as the boy who refused to take a dare and ends it by taking it one step too far, but sadly takes a step backward.\\" Stephanie Gillis won the Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 71st Writers Guild of America Awards for her script to this episode.

About  The Nanaimo Museum is located in downtown Nanaimo on the traditional territory of the Snuneymuxw First Nation. It is a dynamic community facility offering diverse interpretive programming encouraging visitors to “Make a Discovery” while exploring the history and heritage of our area. The museum entered a new era in 2008. Nanaimo's history was given new life with the construction of our facility in the Vancouver Island Conference Centre, created with the vision statement: The Nanaimo Museum will enhance cultural quality of life, anchor our community and enlighten visitors while nurturing the flow of inspiration through interactive presentation of stories and objects spanning Nanaimo's history. Today, the museum offers award-winning exhibits, popular meeting and reception spaces and a destination Gift Shop. The expanded space has allowed the museum to bring top ranked feature exhibits to our community from the Canadian History Museum, the National Gallery and the Vancouver Art Gallery to name a few. Nanaimo & District Museum Society The Nanaimo & District Museum Society celebrated 50 years (incorporated April 2, 1964) in April 2014. The Society operates the Nanaimo Museum and the Bastion with a mission to engage the community and visitors in meaningful experiences relating to the cultural heritage of what is now the City of Nanaimo and surrounding district (i.e. School District #68), as well as to provide a learning environment though which the public can experience links between the past, present and future. The museum's mandate includes: Expanding collections while continuing to ensure they are relevant, well researched and accessible; engaging in as many “communities” as possible through exhibits, events and programs; making exhibitions stimulating, involving, and related to Nanaimo's unique history and development; and using the expanded facility to the best advantage to meet its goals. The museum has always placed a positive and accessible visitor experience at the forefront of operations. It strives to be welcoming and friendly with informed volunteers and to ensure programming and exhibits are informative for residents and visitors alike. It encourages diversity and is a Safe Harbour designated facility.

In December 1982, the group performed their first annual holiday concert which attracted over 900 audience members. The group claims to have originally assembled for \\"aesthetic rather than political purposes,\\" as was described by former Director Lee Ridgeway in an interview. In March 1992, the chorus celebrated its tenth anniversary with a concert at Boston Symphony Hall with the Denver and Washington D.C. gay men's choruses. The chorus was under the direction of Conductor Robert Barney and had approximately 100 members.

Plot In heaven, in apparent homage to the show's traditional opening segment’s couch gags, God and St. Peter sit on the couch discussing possibly relaxing their admissions requirements to address the perceived lack of people there after a recent building project. They look on as Ned Flanders leads a Sunday school class: “Who will get into heaven”. In a montage, to the soundtrack of Ted Moock's cover of “Cheek to Cheek” with its lyric “I'm in heaven”, the children are seen imagining how they die and ascend, with Bart Simpson’s vision including his deathbed conversion repentance. Ned tells them the only way to heaven is to “never stray from the path of righteousness” and, after goading from Nelson Muntz, recalls his non- religious, bebop upbringing as Neddy to beatnik parents, and his subsequent trail of “depraved” jobs until he started doing door-to-door sales. As a salesman of Vertebreaker Trampolines, Ned is initially discouraged, but then the 1971 televised moonwalks of Apollo 14 astronauts “bouncing” on the moon increases sales. He revels in his success, including a promotional billboard stating “Ned Flanders, Your Key To Getting High”, until another salesman tells him that the trampolines are death traps, where a static charge is built up with each bounce, then released en masse on the 500th bounce killing the child. Ned vows to save a then-young Homer Simpson, who the Springfield Shopper reports intends to surpass the “500-bounce barrier” and enter into the Duff Book Of World Records (a reference to Guinness World Records). Ned rushes to intervene, pushes Homer out of the way, and is electrocuted, appearing in heaven before a hippie-stylized, Che Guevara poster-donning Jesus who offers him the chance to live again if he becomes a Christian. He wakes up “reborn” in his hospital bed with “a sign of [God's] mercy”, a permanent scar which is hidden by his mustache. Back in heaven on the couch, St. Peter suggests God consider another potential pool of candidates: atheists, who don't believe in God but might still be righteous. Back in the Sunday school class, Marge Simpson tells a story of her atheist grandmother, Genevieve Bouvier, who she claimed lived in Nazi-occupied France in 1944 during World War II; however, the caption reveals her grandmother was actually living in Nazi-aligned Vichy, France in 1944.https://www.simpsonsworld.com/video/1343596099724 She co- managed Cafe Meaux with the cafe's namesake, her husband Meaux, a Nazi- collaborator. While self-admitted treasonous Meaux bootlicks a Nazi commandant and his entourage of officers, Genevieve goes down to the expansive cellar to prepare dinner for the officers. There she discovers some U.S. paratroopers, whom she disguises as dining staff. During the meal, one of the U.S. soldiers mistakenly reveals the plan for Normandy landings. To stop the Nazis from warning others, the U.S. soldiers sing “La Marseillaise”, France's national anthem, which prompts the cafe patrons to stand and join in blocking the Nazis' exit. Genevieve and Meaux lead the killing of the Nazi officers, thus proving Marge's point that atheists can also do great things. Back in heaven God agrees to opening heaven to atheists. In heaven still, God and St. Peter are visited by Buddha who encourages them to open heaven to other faiths. In the Sunday school class, Lisa Simpson tells the class that besides redemption, and good works, there is the Way of enlightenment. She shares a story she calls “The Princess not affiliated with Disney, unless we are now owned by Disney”. In Lumbini, Shakya Republic of Nepal during the 6th century BC, a spoiled princess Siddmartha (a feminized version of Siddhārtha Gautama, founder of Buddhism) remained dissatisfied despite being denied nothing. She sought a middle path between opulence and decadence, and ventured out of the palace disguised as a poor boy. In search of scholars she goes to Kathmandu U. but frustratingly finds the university a party school; being void of ideas, she opts instead to sit under the Bodhi Tree until she was enlightened. Back in heaven, God agrees that “all the good souls are welcome”. Heaven is instantly crowded again including a shocked Mr. Burns, who was let in as Waylon Smithers’ guest as a plus-one invitee. Burns demands to get in later under his own merit, and Smithers goes after him. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- stating, \\"The episode takes the form of a sort of religion-based Treehouse of Horror, with three stories (told by Ned, Marge, and Lisa, respectively) that test out the new criteria by which God will choose who deserves to hang out for all eternity in the show's traditionally cloudy and harp-strewn paradise. Written by marrieds Dan Castellaneta and Deb Lacusta, along with first-time Simpsons writer Vince Waldron, the result is a decidedly low-stakes outing that, nonetheless, isn't without its charms.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3.5 out of 5 points ranking stating, \\"The Simpsons may not preach against evolution, but they have evolved from the kind of show that was uproariously laugh out loud to evoking us to say, oh, clever. The series will always be a little intellectual, as it is a constant battle between the selfless wisdom of Marge and Lisa and the chaotic buffoonery of Bart and Homer. Where were Bart and Homer, by the way? We get a story from Ned in place of a family member? Could it be it wouldn't matter what they brought as an offering it would send the whole town of Springfield straight to hell? \\"My Way or the Highway to Heaven\\" should have let the boy and his Homer offer their own dark alternative. The episode is tinted too bright.\\" \\"My Way or the Highway to Heaven\\" scored a 1.0 rating with a 5 share and was watched by 2.51 million people, making The Simpsons Fox's highest rated show of the night.

Plot When Lisa's part is cut from the school play Homer takes her clothes shopping to cheer her up. He expresses disgust at the sexualized branding on show, leading Lisa to view him as Atticus Finch from the book To Kill a Mockingbird, her required reading. Homer responds to Lisa's appreciation and the two spend time together including watching the To Kill a Mockingbird movie. Bart feels neglected and sees the school therapist who advises him to act out for attention. He switches everyone's car keys at a bat mitzvah with the unintended consequence that Hans Moleman is run over. The townspeople form a mob and descend on the Simpson house to shoot Bart in punishment. Homer speaks to the crowd, calming their anger to Lisa's amazement. The next day Marge finds that Lisa has had a fight with Bart at school, because Bart insulted Homer. Marge suggests that Homer tell Lisa not to venerate him so highly as it is damaging the family. Lisa decides that it would be best after Homer convinces her that he will always be his father. Eventually, Lisa moves on and Homer gets sad, but Maggie uses hand gestures to tell Homer that despite their flaws, they will always love each other. The episode ends with a future Bart not deciding what to do. In the end, an adult Lisa questions him because he has not decided and he finally decides to kick Homer's butt as Homer's head is now on a robotic body. By then, the rest of Homer's body is now a machine. A collage of images showing Lisa bonding with Homer, Marge bonding with Bart, and Nelson bullying Milhouse is then shown. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- ranking, stating \\"It’s a fine way to understand how The Simpsons can continue to have its main characters run through the same conflicts over and over again, even after 600-plus episodes—knowing the reasons for things doesn’t make human behavior and pain any easier to navigate. That’s why 'Daddicus Finch'’s rushed and clumsy execution is so disappointing. Marge’s manipulations are all over the place, pushing Homer and Lisa together, then apart, all for tenuously sketched reasons that have more to do with wrapping up an ambitious story in time than in providing a satisfying conclusion.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 points ranking, stating \\"'Daddicus Finch' is a very strong episode for The Simpsons. It finds a different angle for something the series always keeps sharp in its arsenal, the book or movie satire. But the episode works because it moves so fast. The asides, recurring gags and taboo-baiting are perfectly offset by the sweet character development in the creamy middle. Getting the footage from the original 1962 film is also a big plus and a marked departure from the all-animated series.\\" \\"Daddicus Finch\\" scored 1.6 rating with 6 share and watched by 4.33 million people, making The Simpsons Fox's highest rated show of the night.

The name is derived from Gamergate, a similar movement related to video games. Its members present it as a consumer protest, primarily advocating their views on social media; some have produced books intended to reflect the group's values. It is part of the alt-right movement, and has been described by commentators as a harassment campaign which \\"targets women, people of color, and LGBT folk in the comic book industry\\". It has been blamed by critics for the vandalism of one store and threats of violence against others.  Views  Members of the movement object to intentional diversification of comics by the major publishers, especially the increasing inclusion of women as writers and characters. Examples include storylines such as those in the \\"All New, All Different\\" campaign undertaken by Marvel Comics in the later 2010s, in which various white male characters that have traditionally had the superhero identities of Wolverine, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, and Spider-Man were temporarily replaced by female and/or racial minority characters. They have complained about stories dealing with current social issues, and the depiction of women with less sexualized figures. They argue that the increasing diversity of comics, both among creators and in terms of characters, have led to declining quality and sales. While it is true that comic sales declined in the late 2010's, this decline was across the board and not limited to, or particular worse for, the diverse comics that Comicsgate targets; some such comics have been notably successful.  Activities  Comics artist Ethan Van Sciver has been a central figure in Comicsgate. Commentator Richard C. Meyer (posting under the banner Diversity & Comics) and former DC illustrator Ethan Van Sciver have been prominent advocates for the campaign. = Social media = In 2016, female superhero Mockingbird was depicted on a comic book cover wearing a t-shirt that read \\"Ask Me About My Feminist Agenda\\". This was followed by harassment on Twitter of series writer Chelsea Cain, including a posted illustration of Mockingbird depicted apparently dead after a brutal attack with her costume torn off, with the t-shirt phrase as a caption. A July 2017 social media post by Marvel Comics assistant editor Heather Antos, featuring several young female coworkers getting milkshakes in memory of company veteran Flo Steinberg, drew attention from members of the movement. Antos was described by them as a \\"diversity hire\\", \\"an unqualified bimbo\\", and \\"the 'false rape charge' type\\", and the group in general as \\"fake geek girls\\", \\"tumblr-virtue signalers\\", and \\"the creepiest collection of stereotypical SJWs anyone could possibly imagine\\". Antos reported receiving rape threats, being doxxed, and – with her friends and coworkers – being the target of a campaign of online harassment for some time afterward. Meyer has made the campaign a common subject on his YouTube channel and Twitter account, in which he identifies professionals whose work or personal activities he sees as detrimental to the comics industry. He took credit for the firing of writer Aubrey Sitterson from the IDW comic G.I. Joe: Scarlett’s Strike Force after Sitterson criticized on social media what he saw as \\"performative grief\\" about the September 11 attacks. In a 2017 video titled \\"The Dark Roast\\", Meyer referred to a female Marvel Comics editor as a \\"cum dumpster\\", accused various female professionals of \\"sucking their way into the industry\\", and described a transgender female writer as a \\"man in a wig\\". Meyer participated in the backlash against the character designs of Netflix adaptation She-Ra and the Princesses of Power; he called showrunner Noelle Stevenson a \\"boyish lesbian\\" and accused her of re-imagining the title character as herself, describing it as \\"utter selfishness and egotism\\". Members of Comicsgate have responded to professionals criticizing the movement by circulating blacklists of such creators to boycott, including one which categorized individuals as members of the \\"Pravda Press\\", \\"SJW vipers\\", and other derogatory labels. Among those placed on such lists and criticized for their views have been Larry Hama, Mark Waid, Alex de Campi, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Matt Fraction, and Ta-Nehisi Coates. Colorist Moose Baumann recounted that he received threats of violence after stepping away from Van Sciver's creator-owned book Cyberfrog. Media critic Kaylyn Saucedo, artist Tim Doyle, comic writer Kwanza Osajyefo, and cosplayer/comic writer Renfamous have all recounted being the target of harassment and doxxing.https://twitter.com/i/status/1078847169996570625https://www.themarysue.com/alt- right-fandom-doxxing-harassment/ = Publishing = A few creators involved with Comicsgate have profited from the controversy it has produced, as with Meyer's No Enemy But Peace. Alt-right activist Vox Day wrote and published the series Alt-Hero and hired Chuck Dixon to write for him. Although Van Sciver has had Vox Day as a guest on his YouTube channel, both he and Meyer have disavowed any association with him. ;Jawbreakers In early 2018, Meyer announced that his crowdfunded comic book Jawbreakers: Lost Souls, a collaboration with freelance artist Jon Malin, would be published by Antarctic Press. Upon learning that some store owners had discussed their decisions not to stock it, he encouraged his followers to publicly post and circulate their names, locations, and employee information. He accused Edmonton, Alberta store Variant Edition of \\"bullying and intimidating their own customers\\" after the female co-owner tweeted that they would not stock the publication; the store was subsequently vandalized and robbed. Dublin, Ireland, store Big Bang Comics, which was not stocking the book, received threats of violence on social media. On May 13, Antarctic Press announced that they were ending their relationship with Meyer, citing shock over his behavior. Meyer blamed freelance writer Mark Waid for contacting Antarctic's owner to talk about the controversy, accusing him of pressuring Antarctic not to publish the book. Both Antarctic and Waid issued statements denying that any threats or bullying had taken place. In October 2018, Meyer sued Waid for \\"tortious interference with contract and defamation\\". In a motion to dismiss, Waid's attorney Mark Zaid asserted that Meyer's own public attacks against industry professionals were responsible, pointing to comments on Twitter calling writer Ta-Nehisi Coates \\"a race hustler\\", accusing a number of female professionals of being hired solely based on gender, and referring to trans and non-binary DC writers as \\"a modern day carnival\\". the case was pending.  Reception  Although many comics professionals have chosen to ignore Comicsgate to avoid giving it publicity, it has been met with widespread criticism from other readers, comics creators, and industry journalists. Both Meyer and Van Sciver have come under criticism for their public comments. Van Sciver has faced backlash from other comic professionals for joking about suicide by Democrats, comments on Reddit about a \\"queer globalist mess\\", and hosting alt-right leader Vox Day in an episode on his YouTube channel. Van Sciver faced criticism over an announced collaboration with cartoonist Dave Sim, whose views about women have been widely criticized as misogynist; Van Sciver likened Sim's past relationship with a 14-year-old girl to that of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, before cancelling the collaboration with no further comment. In mid 2018, Marsha Cooke, widow of writer-artist Darwyn Cooke, denied a claim by Comicsgate participants that her husband would have supported the campaign. After she became the subject of online attacks on Twitter for this, industry veterans including Bill Sienkiewicz, Van Jenson, Tony Bedard, Jeff Lemire, and Magdalene Visaggio wrote rebukes to the movement. In a social media post, writer Scott Snyder, who teaches writing in college and DC Comics' talent development program, said the movement launched \\"cruel, personal attacks\\" on his students that \\"were (and still are) especially repugnant for their sexism, racism, homophobia, and transphobia.\\" After Comicsgate participants claimed that writer Donny Cates supported them, he publicly denounced the movement, saying \\"no one is going to use my art to promote something that has attacked my friends\\". Writer Tom Taylor posted a brief message on social media rejecting the tenets of Comicsgate, stating \\"I believe comics are for everyone. There is no excuse for harassment. There is no place for homophobia, transphobia, racism or misogyny in comics criticism.\\" The social media post was retweeted by creators including Kelly Thompson, Tim Seeley, Margaret Stohl, Jason Latour, Greg Pak, Fabian Nicieza, Benjamin Percy, and Jeff Lemire. In an unsigned editorial, Paste magazine took issue with the phrasing of Taylor's statement, arguing that Comicsgate's activities should not be equated with critical commentary. Greg Hatcher, former administrator of the Comic Book Resources forums, compared the movement to the harassment that drove actresses Kelly Marie Tran and Millie Bobby Brown from social media, and noted that comic creators in earlier decades such as Jack Kirby and Stan Lee had also faced fan backlash for including political themes in comic books.

It aired in the United States on Fox on December 9, 2018. Plot After Thanksgiving dinner, Bart and Lisa give Marge and Homer their Christmas lists, asking for only one present: a smart TV that costs $2,400. When a Black Friday offer is shown on TV at the Sprawl-Mart, Marge and Homer plan a strategy to take advantage of it. Marge waits in line overnight at the store, giving Gil Gunderson some of her winter clothing so he can keep warm. Homer wakes up at 2:30 in the morning to take her place as planned, but gets his scarf caught in the front door and knocks himself unconscious. When the Sprawl-Mart opens at 6:00, Marge hurries to get a smart TV, but stops to help Gil get a present for his granddaughter. By the time she finishes, the shelves have been picked clean. In addition, Gil immediately sells the present to Reverend Lovejoy at a greatly inflated price. As Marge becomes increasingly stressed over the approach of Christmas, Homer and the children secretly book a vacation at a theme park and resort in Florida. They drug Marge's tea to put her to sleep. By the time she wakes up, the entire family is in the car and driving through Tennessee on the way to Florida. Upon reaching the resort, they find themselves booked into a cramped hotel room with an extremely low ceiling. Homer urges Bart and Lisa to act as if they are enjoying themselves for Marge's sake, but the theme park turns out to be full of bizarre, frightening rides and obscure cartoon characters. Bart and Lisa complain to the manager, Jeanie, saying that the site looks nothing like the pictures on its web page. When she ignores them, Bart vows revenge. The Simpsons finally admit to each other that they are not enjoying the trip and decide to leave quickly so they can make it home by Christmas. Bart scares Jeanie by removing the heads from the animatronic figures in the Hall of Vice Presidents and putting them in her bed. The car runs out of gas just outside Springfield, leaving the Simpsons to walk the rest of the way in the snow. Upon reaching town, they find Moe hosting a dinner for the old and needy at his tavern. They join the dinner, along with Grampa Simpson, having gained a new appreciation of the importance of being with family and friends for the holidays. Jeanie refunds the Simpsons' money and adds $2,400 in exchange for their promise never to visit the resort again. They buy the smart TV and begin watching Yule Log in HD, ignoring the actual log burning in the fireplace nearby. Reception Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 2 out of 5 points ranking, stating \\"'Tis the 30th Season' has a better premise than an execution, not to be confused with a crucifixion. Marge does a good deed in the spirit of the holiday and it costs her the perfect Christmas gift for the kids. It's kind of like the gift of the Maggie without even any Oh Henry bars for Homer. The Simpson family sacrifice personal happiness to the least fortunate, former salesman Gil, the unluckiest man in town, only to see it crassly discarded for a better offer. The casual cynicism sends Marge on an implosive breakdown, which is the best part of the episode, but ultimately gets caught in a chimney.\\" Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode C- ranking, stating \\"The Simpsons makes use of family sitcom plots and its own fluid and comically inventive reality to take those hackneyed plots and bend them into something satirically subversive, while still remaining true to its core of recognizable humanity. Or, you know, it should. 'Tis The 30th Season,' however, shows what The Simpsons is like when the inspiration’s left out—a blandly pleasant family sitcom with a few lazy surreal touches thrown in.\\" \\"'Tis the 30th Season\\" scored a 2.8 rating with an 11 share and was watched by 7.53 million people, making \\"The Simpsons\\" Fox's highest rated show of the night.

It aired in the United States on Fox on February 10, 2019. Plot Bart phones Homer at night while at a sleepover because he has had enough of Milhouse's antics, but Homer refuses to go over. Another call comes in and Marge gets the news that her aunt Eunice is dying and that she must fly to visit her. Before leaving, Marge makes Homer promise to not watch the new season of Odder Stuff (a parody of Stranger Things) on Netflix without her. Marge, Patty and Selma go to Eunice's house and Patty and Selma start deciding what they want to inherit, but Eunice finds out and attacks them with a lamp. While Homer looks after Maggie, Bart and Lisa start watching Odder Stuff. Not wanting to break his promise, Homer quickly turns the TV off but at work the next day is horrified to find his colleagues watching the show, leading to him resorting to watch other shows on Netflix to resist the temptation. A vision of Ted Sarandos convinces Homer to finally watch Odder Stuff, but as he reaches the end of the season, Marge returns home and gets angry at him for breaking his promise. Homer has a nightmare, finding himself trapped in vines in the underworld. He asks for Reverend Lovejoy's help but, because Homer spoiled the ending of The Crown, Lovejoy tells him to him to go to Hell. Another vision of Sarandos offers Homer advice, telling him that Marge loves watching dance shows. Following this advice, Homer goes to the 'Some of That Jazz' dance studio to start learning to dance. His instructor Julia has trouble teaching him, so she calls in Sweet Sal, a much tougher instructor. As a cover story, Homer tells Marge each night that he is going to Moe's Tavern. One night, Marge doubts Homer's story, and tells him to sleep on the couch. Homer invites Marge out, saying he will make it all clear at The Snow Ballroom, and they reconcile by dancing together. Meanwhile, Krusty hosts an essay-writing contest called Hello Krusty's: Krusty's Toy Trample!, with the prize being a five-minute dash in his toy store, after which the winner gets to the toys they looted. Bart, Milhouse and Ralph Wiggum are announced as the finalists at the Toy Trample. The contest is close between Bart and Milhouse, but in the end Ralph wins by grabbing both of their carts. Ralph gives Lisa a toy pony, as a thank you for writing his essay for the Toy Trample. Reception During its first broadcast, the episode attracted 1.75 million viewers with a 3 share. This episode was the first episode to have fewer than two million viewers. However, the audience for this episode may have been impacted by the simultaneous broadcast, on CBS, of the 61st Grammy Awards ceremony. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, stating \\"I'm Dancing As Fat As I Can works refreshingly well otherwise, as long as the episode sticks to the story it’s designed to tell...The episode is written by Simpsons first-timer Jane Becker, who's got some Rick And Morty under her belt, and who exhibits a promising understanding of what makes a Marge and Homer story tick, something that’s a lot trickier than it looks.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3 out of 5 stars, stating \\"The issue of binge-watch bonding is a deeply personal one, and Lisa's very moving reaction to her parents having a moment is very effective...One of the best things about Marge and Homer's marriage is that it is constantly on the verge of collapse. This offers a multitude of opportunities for redemption, something Homer usually does with a grand gesture. Some of his grand gestures have been completely accidental, such as when he landed at Marge's feet in a hail of roses. Homer studies hard to make this particular gesture. It is a true work out that works out. Things didn't always work out for the Simpsons even in their happiest of endings and I miss the ambiguity.\\" References External links * 2019 American television episodes The Simpsons (season 30) episodes ","title":"I'm Dancing as Fat as I Can"},{"id":"58418954","text":"Narthacium or Narthakion ( or Ναρθάκἶον) was a city of Phthiotis in ancient Thessaly, in the neighbourhood of which Agesilaus, on his return from Asia in 394 BCE, gained a victory over the Thessalian cavalry.

The journal continued to be published until 1985, and the implications of the indexes of 1972-3 persisted in bearing in various ways – and to a greater and lesser extent upon its content. A new series appeared in 1994, continuing for three issues until 1999. Apart from Baldwin, Ramsden and Harrison, into whose hands the work of Art & Language had been taken by 1976, its contributors included Philip Pilkington and Paul Wood. Further Essays on Art & Language, Charles Harrison , The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 2001 =Editors= The first number was edited by Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth became the American editor from August 1969 until 1972, and Art & Language remained the English editors. In 1971, Charles Harrison became the general editor of Art-Language, and he remained so until the last volume. Contents Given the desire for anonymity attached to the members of the group, it is difficult to know who did what in Art & Language. Nevertheless, the authors of the articles are named in the first seven issues of the magazine, and from 1974, all texts are collectively attributed to Art & Language. But, since during the internal problems that the group encountered between 1975 and 1976, the name Art & Language remained in the hands of Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison, it is logical to give them the authorship of the texts from Volume 3 Number 4.

Synthesis of silylones generally involves the use of sterically bulky carbenes to stabilize highly reactive Si(0) centers. For this reason, silylones are sometimes referred to siladicarbenes. To date, silylones have been synthesized with cyclic alkyl amino carbenes (cAAC) and bidentate N-heterocyclic carbenes (bis-NHC). They are capable of reactions with a variety of substrates, including chalcogens and carbon dioxide.  Theoretical Predictions  General structure of trisilaallene. The structure of carbene-stabilized silylones were first predicted using theoretical calculations by Gernot Frenking and coworkers in 2009. Their theoretical study of silylones was inspired from the development and synthesis of carbones: an analogous structure containing carbon(0) stabilized by two donor-acceptor ligand interactions. It was also inspired by previous reports of trisilaallene: a silylene complex featuring a bent geometry about the Si-Si-Si center. The unexpected bent trisilaallene bond angle was dissimilar that of carbon allenes (C=C=C) yet like that of NHC- stabilized carbones. Towards the goal of rationalizing this structure and to investigate silylones in general, the authors analyzed the energetics of di- coordinated model complexes of silicon(0) (L2Si) and carbon(0) (L2C). More specifically, the analysis was conducted using boron trihydride (BH3) binding analysis and proton affinity analysis at the BP86/TZVPP level of theory. center Compared to analogous model complexes of carbon, the silicon complexes displayed very different characteristics. For example, for two of the examined models, the structure of L2C(BH3)2 could not be energetically minimized whereas it could be for L2Si(BH3)2. Both the silicon and carbon model complexes contained two lone pair orbitals: one with σ-orbital character and one with π-orbital character. However, bonding of one of the model complexes with a single BH3 occurred at the π-lone pair for the silicon complex and at the σ-lone pair for the carbon complex. As a consequence, the bonding geometries of the resultant complexes differed. High values of the second proton affinity (e.g. PA = 142.9, 129.3, 166.8, and 123.9 kcal/mol) and of the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the second BH3 ligand of di-coordinated BH3 complexes (e.g. 26.2, 47.8, 48.1, and 36.6 kcal/mol) were also found. In conjunction with frontier orbital analysis, the high electron density found at the silicon centers suggested that the ligands bonded as donors than covalently. Therefore, the authors claimed that the model complexes were better described as silylones than silylenes. Since high values of the proton affinity were also found for trisilallene, the previously reported complex was also suggested to be a silylone rather than as a silylene. As a result of this analysis, the authors encouraged their exploration by experimentalists.  cAAC Stabilized Silylones  Cyclic alkyl amino carbene (cAAC) ligands, which generally contain sterically bulky and highly electron-donating ligands, have been utilized to synthesize silylone structures. = Synthesis = alt= The first cAAC stabilized silylone was first reported by Mondal et al. in 2013 (where cAAC is ligand used was :C(CH2)(CMe2)2N-2,6-iPr2C6H3). The complex was synthesized by reduction of (cAAC)2SiCl2, a stable biradical precursor species, with two equivalents of potassium graphite (KC8) reducing agent in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. Under this preparation, 95% yield of product was achieved and formed a dark blue solution in hexane with rod-shaped crystals. The crystallized product was found to be stable under inert atmosphere and unreactive towards hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. Furthermore, they were found to melt at 195 °C and decompose at 220 °C. = Structure = The identity of Mondal et al.'s cAAC-stabilized silylone was confirmed using a combination of spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational analysis techniques. Silicon-29 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (29Si-NMR) revealed a signal at 𝛿Si = 66.71 ppm, while ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) showed six absorption bands (λ = 270, 327, 392, 570, and 611 nm). Crystal structure analysis revealed a C-Si-C bond angle of 117.70(8)°, distinguishing it from the previously reported trisilaallene . The Si-C bond lengths were determined to be 1.8411 and 1.8417 Å: similar to Si-C single bonds yet much larger than Si=C double bonds. The authors suggested a singlet ground state for the molecule based on the lack of an observed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal, in agreement with electronic structure calculations. Further electronic structure calculations supported the assignment of the structure as a silylone. Analysis of the valence shell charge concentrations (VSCCs) in the non-bonding region of the complex revealed two distinct areas, indicating the presence of two lone pairs on the central Si. Though the structure contains two lone pairs, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) showed that only one is formally non-bonding while the other participates in 3-centered 2-electron π-bonding. The resultant Si-C π-interaction agreed with calculated bond lengths, as well as general understanding of the cAAC ligands as good π-acceptors relative to NHC ligands. From this, the central silicon atom was proposed to act as a π-electron donor, while the carbene carbons acted as σ-electron donors. Calculation of the first and second proton affinities (PA(1) = 272.2 kcal/mol, PA(2) = 186.7 kcal/mol) of the complex supported the identity of the structure as a Si0 silylone than a SiII silylene, particularly due to the large value of the second proton affinity. Finally, Bader charge analysis of the complex agreed with those predicted from NBO analysis. = Reactivity = alt=In 2014, Roy et al. reported the intermolecular cyclization of a cAAC-stabilized complex with potassium metal reductant in THF through tertiary C-H bond activation (where the cAAC used ligand is :C(CH2)(CMe2)(C6H10)N-2,6-iPr2C6H3). Cyclic voltammetric analysis of the complex showed a quasi-reversible reduction at E1/2 = –1.55 V vs. Fc/Fc+, indicating one-reduction at the carbene carbon due to its π-accepting character. The quasi-reverisible nature of the signal suggested that the complex then underwent further chemical rearrangement. Reduction using metallic potassium in THF produced a solution that changed color from dark blue to greenish-yellow over the course of the reaction. The yellow solid product was then isolated with 80% yield. The product was determined to be a three-coordinate six-membered cyclic silyene: an isomer of the parent silylone. Mass spectroscopy (MS), 29Si-NMR, and carbon-13 NMR (13C-NMR) of the complex verified its identity as an isomer. X-ray single-crystal analysis revealed a trigonal pyramidal geometry with respect to the central silicon and three carbon atoms: this also revealed the presence of a six-membered. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the remaining Si-cAAC bond becomes a covalent double bond rather than as a donor-acceptor interaction. In total consideration of the data, the authors propose a mechanism in which an initial one-electron reduction of the carbene carbon is followed by radical activation of the ligand's Me2(Ar)C−H bond to induce Si-C bond formation.  bis-NHC Stabilized Silylones  bis-N-heterocyclic carbenes have also been used as ligands to stabilize the silicon(0) centers of silylone complexes, with electronic properties different from cAAC-stabilized silylones. = Synthesis = alt=With inspiration from Robinson's seminal NHC-stabilized disilicon(0) complex, the synthesis of bis-NHC stabilized silylones were first reported by Xiong et al. in 2013. The complex is first prepared by the synthesis of a chlorosilyliumylidene precursor complex, which is achieved by ligand exchange of DNHC->SiCl2 with bis-NHC in equimolar amounts in THF. The precursor can then be extracted using acetonitrile in 57% yield, and was structurally characterized by 29Si-NMR, DFT calculations, and crystallgraphic analysis. In particular, DFT revealed HOMO-LUMO similarities to a chlorogermyliumylidene precursor analogue, which was previously successful for forming the analogous bis-NHC stabilized germylone complex. This suggested that the chlorosilyliumylidene would also be successful in forming the silylone complex. This precursor was then further treated with sodium naphthalide reductant in a 2:1 molar ratio in THF at –60 °C to form the final Si(0) complex with 68% yield. A dark red color change was observed over the course of the reaction, which retained its color when converted into a powder. = Structure = alt= Relative to the previously isolated cAAC-stabilized silylone, the bis-NHC stabilized silylone was found to have a more electron- rich Si center. 29Si-NMR of the complex revealed a highly shielded signal at 𝛿 = –80.1 ppm in deuterated benzene. The increased shielding was speculated to be due to the higher σ-donating and weaker π-accepting character of the NHC ligands, as well as the acute 89.1(1)°C-Si-C bond angle. Further calculations of the 29Si shift and NBO charges of the complex supported the interpretation of the NHC ligands as strong sigma donors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the di-coordinate structure of the complex, while also providing insight into its overall geometry. The C3N2Si ring was found to exist in a puckered conformation, with a trigonal planar C-Si-C arrangement. The Si-C bond lengths were found to be 1.864 Å and 1.874 Å and thus asymmetrical . The shortened bonds were also verified from DFT calculations, wherein the HOMO shows π-electron delocalization from the silicon lone pair into the carbene ring. UV-Vis analysis of the complex in toluene shows four absorption maxima, the λ = 547 nm (ɛ = 7.5 x 103) maxima of which was assigned to be the HOMO- LUMO transition via DFT calculations. High values of the proton affinity of the complex (281.7 kcal/mol and 189.4 kcal/mol) suggested that the ligands interact with the silicon center datively rather covalently, consistent with prior electronic structure analysis. Furthermore, it was found to have even stronger donor-acceptor interactions than the cAAC-stabilized analogue. Yet, similar to the cAAC stabilized complex, the orbital character of the lone pairs was found to be asymmetric. One lone pair was found to reside in an orbital with σ-type character, while the other in an orbital with π-orbital- type character. The HOMO-1 of the complex depicts the residence of the s-type lone pair. = Reactivity =  Lewis acids  bis-NHC stabilized silylones were found to react in a one- and two-fold fashion with Lewis acids. Xiong et al. reported the formation of the monomeric complex (bis- NHC)Si(GaCl3) from addition of the Lewis acidic GaCl3 in THF. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a C-Si-C bond angle of 88.59(9)° similar to that of the parent silylone, though 29Si{1H}-NMR revealed larger upfield signal (𝛿si = –119.0 ppm). Yao et al. also reported the reactivity of the silylone with two equivalents of ZnCl2 in THF to form colorless crystals of (bis- NHC)Si(ZnCl2)2. The coordination environment of this complex was observed to be tetrahedral around the silicon by XRD. However, the ZnCl2 was shown to be asymmetrically coordinated, where one is trigonal planar and the other tetrahedral as a result of additional coordination with a molecule of THF.centerThese species were also found to act as a reducing agents, as demonstrated by their ability to reduce GeCl2(dioxane) to Ge0 and NHC->SiCl2 to form Si0 and dinuclear silicon.center  Chalcogenides  alt=bis-NHC stabilized silylones have also been found to react with chalcogens to form silicon(II) monochalcogenides and silicon(IV) dichalcogenides. For example, reaction of the complex with elemental sulfur resulted in a disulfide complex, which appearing as a colorless powder in 89% yield. centerThe structure of the disulfide complex was characterized using high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS, m/z = 5.6125220) and solid state 29Si{1H} NMR (𝛿Si = –32.5 ppm). Natural resonance theory (NRT) analysis revealed symmetric Si-S single bonds that are semi-polar in character. Minor resonance contributions show a structure in which one Si-S contains no bonding while the other double bonding resulting from π-interactions with the Si center. The complex was found to retain Lewis basic properties despite not being a Si(0) complex. For example, the disulfur complex can then form an adduct with GaCl3. XRD analysis of this GaCl3-coordinated structure revealed asymmetric Si-S bond lengths of 2.106(2) Å and 2.006(2) Å and a S-Si-S bond angle of 115.03(8)°. The weight of the aforementioned no-bond/double-bonding resonance was enhanced under addition of the GaCl3 adduct into the model, in expectation with one of the sulfides acting as an electron donor. Other chalcogenide structures have also been synthesized. Reaction of (bis- NHC)Si(GaCl3) with selenium can produce the monochalcogenide (bis- NHC)SiSe(GaCl3). Dichalcogenide analogues with Se and Te can also be synthesized, whose structures were confirmed using 29Si{1H}-NMR, infrared spectroscopy (IR), MS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. NRT analysis of the SiSe2 and SiTe2 complexes reveals a predominance of the resonance form containing a single Si-X (X = Se, Te) bond with semi-polar character, similar to that of the SiS2 structure  Carbon dioxide  Activation of carbon dioxide by bis-NHC stabilized silylones was first reported by Burchert et al. in 2017. The reaction was achieved by exposing a cooled solution of the silylone at –30 °C in THF to carbon dioxide, from which colorless crystals formed over the course of four days. The crystals were then isolated as a white solid in 75% yield. The dicarboxylated reaction product (bis- NHC)Si(CO3)2 was isolated and characterized using IR (νCO = 1746 cm−1) and 29Si{1H}-NMR (𝛿Si = 55.98 ppm). Crystallographic analysis of the complex revealed a SiIV center coordinated by two carbonate ligands in a distorted octahedral geometry. Carbon monoxide was also verified as a reaction product by means of carbon-13 NMR analysis using 13CO2 as a reactant. Using DFT analysis, the authors proposed a reaction mechanism involving the formation two successive silicon-oxo bonds, which was calculated to be a favorable reaction pathway under the given reaction conditions.center  References  Silicon compounds ","title":"Silylone"},{"id":"58419210","text":"The Devil All the Time is a 2020 American psychological thriller film directed by Antonio Campos, from a screenplay co-written with his brother Paulo Campos, based on the novel of the same name by Donald Ray Pollock, who also serves as the film's narrator.

The Devil All the Time was released in select theaters on September 11, 2020, and digitally on Netflix on September 16, 2020. It received mixed reviews from critics, but received praise for the performances of Holland and Pattinson. Plot During World War II, while serving in the Solomon Islands, Marine Willard Russell finds Gunnery Sergeant Miller Jones skinned and left to die on a cross by the Japanese. He shoots Miller to end his misery. Haunted by the experience, Willard loses his faith in God. After the war, on his way home to Coal Creek, West Virginia, Willard passes through Meade, Ohio, where he meets Charlotte, a waitress at a diner. Willard and Charlotte marry and move to Knockemstiff, Ohio, where they have a child named Arvin. In 1950, Helen Hatton, a neighbor of Willard's family, marries the disturbingly charismatic evangelical preacher Roy Laferty, who pours live spiders over his body during his sermons. They have a child named Lenora. Roy is bitten by a spider on his face and has a severe allergic reaction that affects his grip on reality. Believing that he can resurrect the dead, he takes Helen out into the woods, kills her and tries to resurrect her, but fails. After realizing his actions, he abandons his crippled brother Theodore and tries to return home to Lenora. Roy hitchhikes and gets a ride with a pair of married serial killers, Carl Henderson and his wife Sandy. Their ritual involves picking up male hitchhikers, encouraging them to have sex with Sandy while Carl takes photographs, and then murdering them. Carl murders Roy by shooting him in the head after he refuses to have sex with Sandy. In 1957, Charlotte is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Willard believes that if he prays fervently enough he can influence God to save her life. He obsessively and strenuously prays to God, kneeling before a rustic cross he had erected in the woods behind his house. Despite going so far as to crucify Arvin's dog as a sacrifice, Charlotte dies. Willard commits suicide by slitting his own throat. Now an orphan, Arvin goes to live with his grandmother and his uncle in Coal Creek. At his new home, Arvin meets his adopted \\"step-sister\\", Lenora Russell. In 1965, Arvin is given his father's Luger pistol as a birthday present. The church has a new preacher, Reverend Preston Teagarden. Some bullies have been harassing Lenora, and Arvin confronts and savagely beats them. Preston takes advantage of Lenora's innocence and then tricks her into having sex with him, resulting in her becoming pregnant. She tells Preston, but he refuses to help and calls her a whore. Not wanting to bring shame to the family, she is about to commit suicide by hanging before realizing she and her baby would be fine. However, she slips, accidentally hanging herself. Arvin is told that she was pregnant and suspects that Preston was the father. He follows Preston and sees him seduce and have sex with another girl. At the church, Arvin confronts Preston and kills him with the Luger before fleeing in his truck. Arvin hitchhikes and is picked up by Carl and Sandy. When Carl tries to make a move on Arvin, Arvin shoots him in the chest. Sandy and Arvin then shoot each other at the same time, but Carl had earlier loaded Sandy's gun with blanks, feeling he couldn't trust her. Sandy dies, and Arvin finds a fetish collection in the car's glove box consisting of a picture of Sandy holding Roy's dead body and rolls of film. Sandy's brother Lee Bodecker, Meade's corrupt sheriff, learns about Sandy's murder, and to protect himself and his reelection campaign, goes to Carl and Sandy's apartment and finds and burns all of Carl's photos and any other incriminating evidence. Arvin goes to Meade to visit his childhood home. Sheriff Bodecker learns that Arvin murdered Preston from the Coal Creek sheriff and decides to kill him. They confront each other in the woods where Willard's rustic cross resides, where Arvin is able to get off a single shot that fatally wounds the sheriff. Before he dies, Arvin confronts Sheriff Bodecker with the picture of Sandy posing with Roy's dead body. Arvin plants the film and photos on Bodecker's corpse to expose Carl's crimes. Before fleeing from the scene, Arvin buries the Luger with his dog's remains. Arvin hitchhikes and is picked up by a hippie driving a VW van. As he is riding in a car with a stranger, he tries very hard not to fall asleep. The film ends with him daydreaming and contemplating his future as possibly a husband or as a soldier in the Vietnam War.

Simon is enraged that Ava talks to her targets and questions her abilities, but Duke convinces him to leave her alone. However, it is revealed that the bad intel was no accident and Simon orders assassin Alain to kill Ava. Back in Boston, Alain tracks down Ava and attempts to kill her, but gets killed himself in the ensuing fight. Ava now confronts Duke who assures her it had nothing to do with the assassin organization she works for, and that Alain was a former French special forces soldier who was a drug addict and tried to mug her for money. That night, Ava goes to dinner with Judy and Michael but their conversation does not go well. The next morning, Judy meets Ava and tells her Michael is not home. Realizing he has started gambling again, Ava rescues him from a gambling den run by a woman named Toni, to whom Michael is indebted. Following the fight, it is revealed that Michael was a former flame of Ava's and they had agreed to marry before she ran off. He also questions her fighting abilities but she brushes off his concerns. Duke revisits Simon to reveal he knew Ava was set up. Soon, a fight ensues between the two, resulting in Simon overpowering Duke. Back in Boston, Ava tries to reveal her profession to her mother, who realized her dead husband was at fault and, no longer worried about Ava's profession, is proud of the woman Ava has become. Meanwhile, Simon kills Duke and informs Ava. A heartbroken Ava goes to Judy's house where she kisses Michael and invites him to run away with her but he declines, revealing Judy is pregnant. Ava then heads to Toni's den where she kills some of her men before dropping a bag of money for Toni to pay off Michael's debt. Ava reveals to Toni she is a paid assassin before beginning to strangle her, but Ava then changes her mind, letting Toni live while warning her to stay away from Michael. Back to the hotel, Ava gets drunk and fights with Simon, who broke into her room. They brutally fight with both sustaining injuries. The hotel fire alarm goes off and Simon decides to leave, telling Ava that he will kill her if he sees her again. Ava follows soon after and tracks down Simon on the street. She catches up to him, first shooting him in the leg and then killing him with a single shot to the head. Later, Ava goes to Judy's home and gives her and Michael money and access to an offshore bank account before telling them to flee the country. Confused by Ava's mysteriousness, Judy asks who she is and Ava does not reveal her true identity. Before leaving, Michael gives Ava a letter which had arrived for her. The letter is revealed to be from Duke professing that in the end, although he is dead, he is happy with the way his life turned out. As Ava leaves Judy's home, Camille appears behind her and follows her before the screen cuts to black.

Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 19% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 4.46/10. On Metacritic, the film was assigned a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Guy Lodge of Variety wrote that \\"the film provides an adequate showcase for its producer-star's unexpected prowess as an action hero — yet Matthew Newton's skimpy, dial-a-cliché script makes the whole enterprise feel more like a mid-range series pilot than a major star vehicle.\\" Writing for The Hollywood Reporter Boyd van Hoeij said that \\"Chastain is utterly convincing in another tough-as-nails role. If audiences stick with the movie, it's largely thanks to her movie-star charisma, which almost compensates for the increasingly ridiculous plot. Malkovich and Farrell seem to understand they are A-list talent in B-movie roles, and relish the opportunity.\\" = Box office and VOD = In Hungary, the film made $31,820 from 59 theaters in its opening weekend, finishing first at the box office. , the film has grossed a total of $2.8 million worldwide. In its debut weekend in the U.S., Ava was the most rented film on Apple TV and Google Play, and second on FandangoNow. In its second weekend the film topped Apple TV, Google Play, and Spectrum, and remained second at FandangoNow. IndieWire described the performance of Ava as \\"the best showing for a non-premium title in the six months we’ve covered weekly VOD performance.\\" Controversy In August 2018, the production drew criticism due to Matthew Newton, who at the time was set to direct, having been accused of multiple allegations of assault and domestic violence. In addition to the accusations, he had also pled guilty to assaulting Brooke Satchwell, his then girlfriend. Jessica Chastain, a vocal advocate for the Me Too movement, was accused of hypocrisy for working with Newton. Newton would ultimately step down from directing the film, with Tate Taylor hired to replace him. Newton is credited as the film's writer.

Cram Bates (August 25, 1839 – March 23, 1905) was an American writer, journalist, and newspaper editor. She was widely known throughout the Grand Traverse region, and throughout the State of Michigan as well, having been closely identified with literary work since childhood. She was, perhaps, the first woman in the state who engaged in regular newspaper work, having been connected with the Grand Traverse Herald, of which her husband, Thomas Tomlinson Bates, was editor, since 1876. Early years and education Martha Elizabeth Cram was born in Northville, Michigan, August 25, 1839. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Cram, whose family moved to Traverse City, Michigan in 1863. Her early childhood was spent in Northville, Goodrich, and Flint, Michigan. At the age of 14, Bates began to teach school, being a teenager of remarkable mental ability and a good student. Later on, she attended the Ypsilanti State Normal School and was one of the early graduates of what is now Eastern Michigan University. From early childhood, she developed literary tendencies, and while still a girl, wrote many articles of literary merit which found publication in leading periodicals. Career Bates devoted several years of her early life to teaching. But she not only had the ability, but the inherent ambition to become a writer. In early womanhood, she contributed constantly to the leading magazines of that period and her work was eagerly sought by publishers. On May 5, 1867, she married Thomas T. Bates. After her marriage, Bates continued her literary work with her husband, becoming the associate editor of the Grand Traverse Herald since that paper came into possession of Mr. Bates in 1876. The most conspicuous features of her literary work were the Home and Sunshine departments of the Herald, and for seven years, the Household department of the Evening Record. These departments were always popular and were read by readers in thousands of homes in Traverse City and the Grand Traverse region. The Herald was a large, 8-column, 10-page paper, and was home-printed, a feature involving an extra amount of editorial labor of husband, wife, and daughter working together. Bates was the oldest, continuous, newspaper correspondent in Michigan, and for nearly forty years, had been one of the most prominent writers for the Detroit Tribune. She was one of the organizers of the Michigan Woman's Press Association in 1890; its president for several years; and after the death of Lucinda Hinsdale Stone, honorary president of the association. When the Ladies' Library Association of Traverse City was organized in 1896, Bates was one of its charter members, and a member of the executive board until her health failed. After her activity ceased, she was made an advisory member of the board. Among the charter members of the Woman's Club, Bates was numbered as one of the most active and she was, devoted to the advancement of woman's work. She was also an honorary member of Traverse Bay Hive, Ladies of the Maccabees (L. O. T. M.). In addition to her work on the Herald, Bates did an immense amount of literary work in the way of correspondence, sketches, stories and poems. She also wrote several books. With Mary Knezik Buck, Bates was the joint author of, Along Traverse Shores, and A Few Verses for a Few Friends. Bates was the author of Young People's History of Michigan, which was used in many schools of the State for historical study. Personal life In religion, Bates was one of the three surviving charter members of the Congregational church. While she had been an invalid for about three years, Bates suffered much during the last six months. She died at Traverse City, March 23, 1905, and was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in that town. She was survived by her husband, Thomas, and three children, George G. Bates, proprietor of the American Poultry Journal of Chicago and vice president of the Herald and Record Co.; Mabel and Clara.

A predecessor of the union was founded in 1874 as the National Amalgamated Society of Colliery Mechanics, but it quickly lost members and by the end of 1878 was nearly defunct. At the start of 1879, a new union was formed, covering only the Durham coalfield. The Durham Miners' Association saw it as a sectional, breakaway, group, and in its early years it was a conservative organisation, seeking to maintain the privileges of the mechanics as opposed to other colliery workers. By 1892, the union had 2,477 members, and this grew further, to 4,908 in 1911. That year, it was a founding member of the National Federation of Colliery Mechanics' Associations, with other similar organisations in Northumberland and Scotland – in other areas of the country, mechanics remained part of the main miners' unions. It also worked with the Durham Miners' Association, Durham County Colliery Enginemen's Association and the Durham Cokemen's Association in the Durham County Mining Federation Board. From 1897 to 1923, the union was led by John Wilkinson Taylor. It sponsored him as a Labour Party candidate, and he sat as a Member of Parliament from 1906 until 1919. Under his leadership, the union continued its growth, membership peaking at 9,509 in 1925. In 1944, the union became part of Group Number 1 of the National Union of Mineworkers, along with the Northumberland Colliery Mechanics and the Yorkshire Winders and Enginemen. During the UK miners' strike of 1984–1985, it was led by Bill Etherington. Some members split away, forming an anti-strike Colliery Mechanics' Association which hoped to establish itself on a national basis, but the majority of members remained with the union.

He tries to get in shape after an injury. His wife Šarlota tries to get pregnant but Roman's obsession leads to deterioration of their relationship. Cast * Jiří Konvalinka as Roman * Tereza Hofová as Šarlota * Miroslav Hanuš as Doctor * Tomáš Bambusek as Kustod Review Hossein Eidizadeh wrote for that \\"Virtually the entire film happens in Roman’s apartment. For most of the film, we see him cycling madly on an exercise bike; we see the expansion and contraction of his muscles, as if we are following the routines of a laboratory rat under examination. You get so close to Roman and his obsession that, by the end of the film, you are out of breath, as if having cycled for two hours. Sedlák’s first film is visually compelling; he creates an ominous atmosphere in which the only sound heard is Roman’s breathing, his cycle, and the oxygen machine. Šarlota (Tereza Hofová), Roman’s wife, longs for a baby and the presence of the oxygen tent adds another level to this already horrifying story of alienation and makes way for the hard-to- forget ending of this domestic thriller.\\" References External links * 2018 films Czech sports films Czech drama films Czech films Czech-language films Czech Lion Awards winners (films) Golden Kingfisher winners ","title":"Domestik"},{"id":"58419488","title":"2018 Thindown Challenger Biella"},{"id":"58419505","text":"Leodia sexiesperforata, commonly known as the six-holed keyhole urchin, is a species of sand dollar, in the echinoderm order Clypeasteroida. It is native to tropical and sub-tropical parts of the western Atlantic Ocean where it buries itself in soft sediment in shallow seas. Description Like other sand dollars, Leodia sexiesperforata is radially symmetrical and flattened dorso-ventrally, having a circular or semi-pentagonal shape, but it also displays secondary, front-to-back bilateral symmetry. It is usually somewhere between in diameter. The mouth is on the oral (under) surface and is surrounded by the peristome and five deep, narrow food grooves, that branch as they near the margin. On the aboral (upper) surface of the test are five short, petal-like areas which are used as gills and six oval lunules (slots) which give the species its name \\"sexiesperforata\\". Five of these slots are in the ambulacral areas and the sixth is on the posterior interambulacral area. The anus is located in this lunule. The aboral surface is shallowly domed, the highest point being at the anterior petal, while the oral surface is flat. The body surface is covered with small spines which give it a velvety appearance. The colour of this sand dollar varies but is usually some shade of yellowish- brown or pale brown. Image:Mellita sexiesperforata (six-keyhole sand dollar) (San Salvador Island, Bahamas).jpg Image:Leodia sexiesperforata MN 01.jpg Distribution and habitat Leodia sexiesperforata is native to the tropical and sub-tropical western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from North Carolina southwards to Uruguay. It is found at depths down to about but is commonest at less than half that depth. It inhabits sandy areas where there is little seagrass or algal growth. Ecology Leodia sexiesperforata inhabits the seabed and buries itself in the soft sediment to a depth of or so. It can bury itself in five to seven minutes. The purpose of the lunules may be to equalise pressure above and below the sand dollar, thus reducing lift and helping prevent it from being washed away by strong currents. It feeds on detritus and small organic particles, picking them up with the tube feet on the oral surface, moving them to the food grooves and thence to the mouth, where they are ground up by the teeth.

Lincoln Colcord delivered his son Lincoln aboard the commercial sailing ship, the Charlotte A. Littlefield, during a storm while navigating around Cape Horn. Aside from time spent on shore at Penobscot Bay or in Searsport, Maine, Lincoln and his older sister, Joanna Carver Colcord, spent most of their childhood at sea aboard the various sailing vessels captained by his father, visiting ports as far away as Hong Kong as part of the merchant trade.  Education and writing career  Jane Colcord tutored her children at sea, and Lincoln's early high school education was by correspondence course. It was only after he entered the high school in his hometown of Searsport, Maine that he became rooted more to the soil than the sea. Colcord attended the University of Maine, where he also wrote the lyrics to the \\"Maine Stein Song,\\" later recorded by his friend Rudy Vallee. The song was also published as sheet music during the 1930s, leading to a brief battle over copyright. He was once employed as a civil engineer with the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad in Maine. He was considered by many to be one of the best and most authentic American authors of sea stories in his time and beyond. His first published story appeared in 1908. His short fiction was serialized in various magazines such as The American, McClure's, The Bookman, and Burr McIntosh Monthly, among others. His books include The Drifting Diamond, An Instrument of the Gods, Under Sail, The Game of Life and Death, as well as his epic poem, Vision of War. His works often featured themes relating to Asian culture and the far east, regions and people who had a large influence on him as a boy during his voyages. He is also noted for bringing to print the English translation of Ole Rølvaag's book Giants in the Earth, and as a contributor to various other works, including the nautical history, Sailing Days on the Penobscot by George S. Wasson. As a journalist, he wrote political commentary for various American newspapers and magazines including the International News Service, The New York Post, Hampton's Magazine, The Nation, The Washington Post, The Freeman, The American Mercury, The Dial, The New York Call, and the Philadelphia Public Ledger, where he was staff correspondent beginning in 1917. His journalism often caused controversy. In the investigative case files of the Bureau of Investigation, he was branded as a \\"strong advocate of the Lenin-Trotsky regime.\\" He was Secretary of the League of Free Nations Association. As a political journalist, he is also listed as a director of New English Monthly Magazine The Searchlight, a publication listed under the heading of \\"Foreign Radical Publications\\" by the Office of Radical Publications. Here, Colcord is also branded as a \\"propagandist.\\" He was profiled in the 1954 The New Radicalism in America, 1889–1963 by Christopher Lasch. The book highlights his close association with an adviser of US President Woodrow Wilson, Edward M. House.  Late life  Following his career in journalism, Colcord focused his life on maritime history as a founder of the Penobscot Marine Museum in Searsport, Maine, and the journal, The American Neptune. He was elected in 1936 as Clerk of the Corporation and Secretary to the Board of the museum.

He was the youngest of four children born to Joseph Wright Alsop IV (1876–1953) and Corinne Douglas Robinson (1886–1971), both of whom also served in the Connecticut General Assembly. Among his siblings was journalists Joseph Alsop and Stewart Alsop. His father was descended from a family that was long prominent in politics, including Continental Congressman John Alsop, Richard Alsop, John Alsop King, and direct descendant of James Monroe. His paternal grandfather, Dr. Joseph Wright Alsop III, was the Democratic nominee for Lt. Governor of Connecticut in 1891. Through his mother, he was descended from the Oyster Bay branch of the Roosevelt family, his maternal grandmother was Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, his grand-uncle was President Theodore Roosevelt, and Eleanor Roosevelt was his first cousin once-removed. He graduated from Kingswood School in West Hartford, and like his older brother Stewart, Alsop attended Groton School, graduating in 1933, and Yale University, graduating in 1937, where he was a member of Scroll and Key. Career Following his graduation from Yale, he began working at Smith, Barney & Company in New York. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served with the Office of Strategic Services in England, France and China. During the War, Alsop was a member of a seven-man British- American team that parachuted into behind enemy lines in Nazi-occupied France and worked with resistance fighters to \\"spot enemy airfields and teach underground tactics to the French guerilla army.\\" He was the recipient of a Bronze Star with cluster and was eventually being promoted to captain. Alsop served as president of the Covenant Insurance Group in Hartford for 27 years, a company that was founded by his father in the 1920s as Hartford County Mutual Fire Insurance Company and the Connecticut Valley Mutual Hail Insurance Company. Along with John Filer, the former chairman of Aetna, and DeRoy Thomas of ITT Hartford, he was one of the principal organizers of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, which became a significant lobbying force in Connecticut on insurance issues. He retired in 1980. =Political career= From 1947 until 1949, Alsop, who was referred to as a \\"blue-blooded moderate\\" and \\"Connecticut Yankee Republican\\" was elected and served two terms in the Connecticut General Assembly representing Avon, allied with the liberal wing of the Republican party. In office, he sponsored and championed a bill known as the Alsop Birth Control bill which would \\"permit physicians to prescribe the use of contraceptives for married women whose lives may be endangered by pregnancy.\\" At the end of the 1949 legislative session, he also helped push through three desegregation bills submitted by the Connecticut NAACP that outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, public-housing projects, and the National Guard. He was an early backer of Dwight D. Eisenhower's campaign for president in 1952, serving as a state vice chairman for the campaign. During the campaign, he was \\"credited with creating the amiable 1952 epithet 'egghead' in the modern political vocabulary.\\" In 1958, Alsop sought the Republican nomination for governor of Connecticut, but lost in the primary to Fred R. Zeller, the State Controller by a count of 276 votes to 349 votes, who himself overwhelmingly lost to Gov. Abraham Ribicoff in the general election. He attempted again in 1962, this time winning the nomination over Edwin H. May Jr. on the eighth ballot at the party convention after a deadlock of more than ten hours. Alsop ultimately lost the election to the incumbent Governor and former Lieutenant Governor, John N. Dempsey, who served from January 1961 to January 1971, by 482,671 votes to 549,030 votes for Dempsey. While he did not seek the nomination again or hold public office, he continued to be involved in the party and represented Connecticut on the Republican National Committee from 1968 until 1984. Personal life On June 19, 1947, Alsop was married to Augusta McLane \\"Gussie\\" Robinson (1924–2015) at Trinity Episcopal Church in Hartford, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Lucius F. Robinson and Augusta (née McLane) Robinson. Gussie attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut and served as a Red Cross nurses' aide during World War II. In 1986, the family moved to Old Lyme, Connecticut from their farm on Talcott Notch in Avon, where he was born. Together, John and Augusta were the parents of four children, three of whom lived to maturity, a son and two daughters: * John deKoven Alsop, who married Janice Stuver and served as the Assistant Attorney for the state of Maine. * Mary Oliver Alsop, who married Peter Farnum Culver in 1978. * Augusta McLane Alsop, who married Michael David Hoy, a woodworker. * Samuel Alsop, who died as an infant. Alsop died on April 6, 2000 at a health care center in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. His funeral was held at St. Ann Church in Old Lyme, Connecticut.

In Greek mythology, it was said to have been founded by Ormenus, the grandson of Aeolus, and was the birthplace of Phoenix (a grandson of Ormenus).Demetr. Scepsius ap. Strabo identifies this town with a place in Magnesia named Orminium, situated at the foot of Mt.

William Martin Leake, however, observes that the Ormenium of Homer can hardly have been the same as the Orminium of Strabo, since it appears from the situation of Asterium that Eurypylus ruled over the plains of Thessaliotis, which are watered by the Apidanus and Enipeus.William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 434, et seq.

Oxfam donated a camera and projection equipment, and the Department acquired a Land Rover with a built-in power generator. The unit produced short films on various topics that it then showed to people in villages. One film, 'Two Years of Progress', highlighted the government's achievements in the two years following independence. In 1969, the unit was transferred to the control of the Department of Information. Following this transfer, it began producing films on topics such as health, nutrition, the 1973 census, and the 1978 state visit of the President of Nigeria. In 1969, Ebrima Sagnia was sent on a production course at the London Film School, returning in 1972 to head the unit. The unit acted in the place of a television service in remote parts of The Gambia. Early production was hampered by a lack of laboratory facilities and editing equipment, and the lack of trained Gambians in this field. Due to these conditions, the government requested assistance from the UN Development Programme for the expansion of the unit. An expert from the UNDP began working with the unit in July 1972. In 1975, a black and white film laboratory and the training of technicians were also provided for. In 1981, the unit was able to capture footage of the coup d'etat attempt that was used by news media across the world. The unit held an important role in Gambian media, alongside Radio Gambia and the Gambia News Bulletin. The unit became part of Gam TV, The Gambia's first TV station, which was shortlived before it became itself part of Gambia Radio & Television Service (GRTS) in 1995. Sagnia and others involved in the unit have since been described as \\"pioneers\\" of Gambian film by Gambian filmmaker Prince Bubacarr Aminata Sankanu.

Ontario's parent company, Cook United, discontinued the use of the Ontario brand when it bought the Rink's Bargain Barn chain in 1981. The remaining Ontario stores were rebranded as Rink's or Cooks stores. Cook United closed its remaining stores in 1987. History Ontario Super Mart was a Lorain, Ohio-based retail chain that began in the 1950s selling clothing, groceries, hardware, electronics and household goods. By the early 1960s, Ontario operated stores in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. In 1964, the nine-store chain was acquired by Cook Coffee Co. of Maple Heights, Ohio, which would become Cook United Inc.“Cook Acquires Ontario.” Cincinnati Enquirer, 24 September 1964, p. 52. Cook United would operate the chain under the name of Ontario Discount Department Stores along with Pic-n-Pay Supermarkets, Uncle Bill's Discount Department Stores, Whitehall's Discount City, and Consolidated Sales Company or CSC Stores. The Ontario chain expanded with stores in Missouri and growth into additional Ohio markets including Toledo. In 1968, Cook United acquired Clark's Department Stores in the United States from the Gamble's chain. Some of the Clark locations were converted to Cooks Discount Department Store. Because of the acquisitions, Cook United had discount stores in Texas, New Mexico, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Kentucky at the start of the 1970s. The company's goal was to reach $1 billion in sales and forecasted that it would operate more than 100 stores under its various brand names by 1975.“Ontario Will Open New Store Thursday.” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 8 March 1970, p. 55.) In 1975, the company had grown to 82 stores and had fallen short of its sales target. Cook United announced it would discontinue Ontario store operations in Missouri.“Ontario Stores to Close.” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 9 October 1975, p. 20. The parent company continued to close stores and had just 23 Ontario stores remaining at the beginning of the 1980s.

In 1883 she helped organize the Art Association of Indianapolis. Biography Ketcham was born on June 28, 1841 Indianapolis, Indiana. Both sides of her family had an illustrious history in the state. Her father, John Lewis Ketcham, was a prominent lawyer, and son of early Indiana settler Col. John Ketcham. Her mother, Jane Merrill Ketcham, was the daughter of the first treasurer of Indiana, Samuel Merrill. Susan was the third child of John and Jane, with five younger siblings, including William A. Ketcham, Attorney General of Indiana from 1894-98. The Ketcham children’s earliest art education came from the wife of Bishop Talbott, who taught them both music and painting at home. Career Ketcham studied at the Indiana School of Art, the Art Students League of New York, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She also attended the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art. Her teachers included William Merritt Chase and Charles Herbert Woodbury. Ketcham was a member of the Society of Independent Artists and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. She exhibited at the Hoosier Salon, the Boston Art Club, the National Academy of Design, the Society of Independent Artists, and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. Ketcham also exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois and at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1883 she was one of a group of eighteen women, led by May Wright Sewall, who founded the Art Association of Indianapolis. This association grew into the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Herron School of Art. From about 1886-88, Ketcham joined her mother and two of her siblings on a trip to Europe “for music and health.” While in Florence, Italy, she felt the initial calling to become a painter and later found inspiration in Switzerland, where she started her studies. Upon returning to the United States she enrolled in the Art Students League in New York in 1888, and that same year was elected a life member. She remained in New York City for most of the next three decades, spending her summers in Ogunquit, Maine, and making periodic trips home to Indianapolis. Ketcham's first solo exhibit was held in the H. Lieber Company gallery in Indianapolis in June 1900, although her work had previously been displayed in many other exhibits across the country. The show included a collection of 60 oils, water colors, and pastels. One of Ketcham’s more celebrated pieces was a painting of her mother, originally titled “Portrait of a Lady” and later changed to “Portrait of My Mother.” It was exhibited during the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. She lived in a New York apartment near her studio in Carnegie Hall, until she decided to return home to Indianapolis in 1927. Legacy Ketcham died on February 1, 1930 in Indianapolis. Prior to this event, in 1928, she gifted a piece entitled “Evening” to Indiana University, her father’s alma mater. The piece was made in his memory. She also gave “After the Storm” to the John Herron Art Institute, now the Herron School of Art and Design at IUPUI. Prior to her death she stipulated that other works would be donated to schools around the city. After Susan’s passing the John Herron Art Institute arranged a memorial exhibition of 22 paintings in the Marott Hotel.

Clam gardens are a form of mariculture, where First Nations peoples created an optimal habitat for clams by modifying the beach. These clam gardens are a food source for both First Nations peoples and animals. They also provide food security as they are a food source that can be readily harvested when needed. Clam gardens are found along the west coast of North America. Over 2,000 clam gardens have been identified on the coast of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and California. Though most clam gardens are currently untended, restoration of sections of previously untended clam gardens are occurring in Fulford Harbour on Salt Spring Island and on Russell Island located in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve.  Composition  = Boulder wall = Once a location was chosen by an individual or a group of First Nations peoples, clam garden construction began with the creation of a boulder or rock wall on the chosen enclosed beach. Strong individuals would roll large boulders down to the lowest tideline on the beach, thus creating a rock wall. The rising tide brings sediment over the rock walls, where it becomes trapped in the clam garden. The rock wall is low enough that it allows the clam garden to be submerged at high tide, but tall enough that the beach is exposed for harvesting during low tide. Due to weather and the movement of tides, rock walls require continual maintenance. Historically, clam gardens were regularly tended by First Nations individuals regularly moving rocks from inside the clam gardens onto the rock wall. Both archeological evidence and traditional knowledge assert that boulder walls were built up over time and continually maintained. Individuals continually added new rocks at the top of the boulder wall, presumably by First Nations peoples when they were harvesting clams. = Sediment = The accumulation of sediment trapped by the boulder wall creates a flatter beach, which is an optimal growing habitat for clams. This sediment has an optimal density for clam growth, free from fine clay and silt particles that are washed away by the high tide. The density of the sediment was also due to the process of aerating the sand while clams were harvested. Many clam gardens also have a high amount of gravel and shell hash, which aid in aerating the sand. This density allows for freer movement of clams, in addition to easier removal of clams from the sediment. = Animals = Clam gardens are an ideal habitat for many animals. The modified beach attracts growth of many clams, notably: butter, littleneck, cockle and horse clams. Animals such as barnacles, snails, crabs, eels, mussels, and sea cucumbers also live in clam gardens. Other animals such as ghost shrimp and worms are found buried in the loose sediment.  Usage  = Food source = Clam gardens were a food source for many Coast Salish peoples, and provided food security to many diverse First Nation communities. This was due to the abundance of clams that could be easily harvested and were readily accessible. Women and children were the primary group tasked with harvesting clams at low tide, though everyone in the community could participate. Once harvested, families could consume the clams immediately or smoke them to be preserved for the winter. Resources of clams, either smoked or harvested from the gardens were important since they served as sustenance when other foods were scarce. Some nations, such as the Kwakwaka’wakw nation, traditionally harvested clams from October to early March so as to avoid the red tide. Clam gardens were not exclusive to humans but also served as a protein-rich food source for animals, such as bears, during the spring or summer. Animals such as raccoons, mink, river otters, bears, sea ducks, and geese also feed in clam gardens. = Knowledge transmission = Traditional clam harvesting also allowed for intergenerational knowledge transmission, with elders passing down knowledge about clam gardens to the next generation. Clam gardens were similar to an outdoor classroom, where traditional knowledge, language and cultural practices could be learned by the community. = Ownership = Each nation has specific protocols and governance systems around land management, and many access areas are family based. For clam gardens, families often asserted ownership by regularly tending to the beach and maintaining the rock wall. These clam gardens were then handed down to the next generation. Historically, unmanaged clam gardens could be harvested by anyone in the community. Families could claim ownership by building their own clam garden on an undeveloped beach area in their traditional territory.  Historical age  The exact age of the origin of clam gardening is unknown. In present day, scholars argue that accurately dating clam gardens is difficult due to the rock wall being submerged, in addition to rising sea levels. Archeologists are studying the ages of clam gardens using methods such as optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating on the rock wall. Scholars are using both methods to gain a better understanding of the age of clam gardens. The results are different depending on the sample as evidence suggests walls were built up by communities over time. Dating results suggest that clam gardens range from 1000 to 1700 years old, whereas other samples indicate that they are around 3000 years old. Conversely, many First Nations peoples have a different perspective of clam garden creation. For example, Clan Chief Adam Dick, Kwaxsistalla of the Kwakwaka'wakw nation, states that clam gardens have been around “since the beginning of time.” Tom Sewid, a Native Watchman of the Mamalilikulla-Qwe'Qwa'Sot'Em nation, states that his ancestors have maintained clam gardens over \\"thousands of years\\" citing clam gardens as title to his traditional lands.  Restoration  Clam garden restoration work is currently occurring in two clam gardens in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve in a project between Parks Canada and the Hul'q'umi'num and Saanich nations.

Commonly, these are benign lesions that are found incidentally during radiology studies for other indications. Vertebral hemangiomas are a common etiology estimated to be found in 10-12% of humans at autopsy.Blecher, R., et al., Management of symptomatic vertebral hemangioma: follow-up of 6 patients.

They are benign in nature and frequently asymptomatic. Symptoms, if they do occur, are usually related to large hemangiomas, trauma, the hormonal and hemodynamic changes of pregnancy (causing intra-spinal bleeding), or osseous expansion and extra-osseous extension into surround soft tissues or epidural region of the spinal canal.Chi, J.H., G.T.

Journal of Orthopaedic Case Reports, 2017. 7(2): p. 7-10.  Etiology and epidemiology  Vertebral hemangiomas are hamartomatous lesions, meaning that they arise from dysembryogenetic origin. They are made up of thin-walled vessels infiltrating the medullary cavity between bone trabeculae and are usually confined to the vertebral body.Rodallec, M.H., et al., Diagnostic imaging of solitary tumors of the spine: what to do and say. Radiographics, 2008. 28(4): p. 1019-41. VHs are commonly seen incidentally while obtaining imaging for other indications. Only around 1% of hemangiomas become symptomatic. When symptomatic, they can cause pain and myelopathy by intra-spinal bleeding, bony expansion or extra- osseous extension into surround soft tissue or the posterior neural elements. Highly vascular (cavernous type) hemangiomas can produce neurologic deficits without prominent evidence of spinal cord compression. The deficits in these cases are probably attributable to blood flow disturbances in the spinal cord.  Imaging characteristics  On computed tomography (CT) or radiograph, VHs can cause rarefaction with vertical striations (often referred to as corduroy pattern) or a coarse honeycomb appearance. A polka-dot appearance on CT scan represents a cross-section of reinforced trabeculae.Slon, V., et al., Vertebral Hemangiomas and Their Correlation With Other Pathologies. Spine (Phila Pa 1976), 2016. 41(8): p. E481-8. Baudrez, Galant, and VandeBerg found that MRI appearance is dictated by histology of the tumor—Vascularity, interstitial edema, and interspersed fat.Baudrez, V., C. Galant, and B.C. Vande Berg, Benign vertebral hemangioma: MR-histological correlation. Skeletal Radiol, 2001. 30(8): p. 442-6. The presence of high or moderate signal intensity on both T1 and T2 images is related to the ration of fat to vessels and edema. For example, a VH with a high concentration of fat and a relatively low make-up of vessels and edema would show a high signal intensity on T1-weighted spin-echo images and intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted fast spin echo images. Whereas a VH made-up of nearly equal portion of fat and vessels and edema would show intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.  Differential diagnosis  The differential diagnosis for lesions with similar radiologic appearance to VH includes but is not limited to hemangioblastoma, lymphangioma, bone metastasis, Ewing Sarcoma, and spinal dural arteriovenous fistula.Bemporad, J.A., et al., Pseudohemangioma of the vertebra: an unusual radiographic manifestation of primary Ewing's sarcoma.

Object segments are depicted by the red edge. In computer vision, object co-segmentation is a special case of image segmentation, which is defined as jointly segmenting semantically similar objects in multiple images or video frames.  Challenges  It is often challenging to extract segmentation masks of a target/object from a noisy collection of images or video frames, which involves object discovery coupled with segmentation. A noisy collection implies that the object/target is present sporadically in a set of images or the object/target disappears intermittently throughout the video of interest. Early methods typically involve mid-level representations such as object proposals.  Dynamic Markov networks-based methods  The inference process of the two coupled dynamic Markov networks to obtain the joint video object discovery and segmentationA joint object discover and co-segmentation framework based on coupled dynamic Markov Networks. A joint object discover and co-segmentation method based on coupled dynamic Markov networks has been proposed recently, which claims significant improvements in robustness against irrelevant/noisy video frames. Unlike previous efforts which conveniently assumes the consistent presence of the target objects throughout the input video, this coupled dual dynamic Markov network based algorithm simultaneously carries out both the detection and segmentation tasks with two respective Markov networks jointly updated via belief propagation. Specifically, the Markov network responsible for segmentation is initialized with superpixels and provides information for its Markov counterpart responsible for the object detection task. Conversely, the Markov network responsible for detection builds the object proposal graph with inputs including the spatio-temporal segmentation tubes.  Graph cut-based methods  Graph cut optimization is a popular tool in computer vision, especially in earlier image segmentation applications. As an extension of regular graph cuts, multi-level hypergraph cut is proposed to account for more complex high order correspondences among video groups beyond typical pairwise correlations. With such hypergraph extension, multiple modalities of correspondences, including low-level appearance, saliency, coherent motion and high level features such as object regions, could be seamlessly incorporated in the hyperedge computation. In addition, as an core advantage over co- occurrence based approach, hypergraph implicitly retains more complex correspondences among its vertices, with the hyperedge weights conveniently computed by eigenvalue decomposition of Laplacian matrices.  CNN/LSTM-based methods  Overview of the coarse-to-fine temporal action localization in . (a) Coarse localization. Given an untrimmed video, we first generate saliency- aware video clips via variable-length sliding windows. The proposal network decides whether a video clip contains any actions (so the clip is added to the candidate set) or pure background (so the clip is directly discarded). The subsequent classification network predicts the specific action class for each candidate clip and outputs the classification scores and action labels. (b) Fine localization. With the classification scores and action labels from prior coarse localization, further prediction of the video category is carried out and its starting and ending frames are obtained.Flowchart of the spatio- temporal action localization detector segment-tube. As the input, an untrimmed video contains multiple frames of actions (e.g., all actions in a pair figure skating video), with only a portion of these frames belonging to a relevant category (e.g., the DeathSpirals). There are usually irrelevant preceding and subsequent actions (background). The Segment-tube detector alternates the optimization of temporal localization and spatial segmentation iteratively. The final output is a sequence of per-frame segmentation masks with precise starting/ending frames denoted with the red chunk at the bottom, while the background are marked with green chunks at the bottom. In action localization applications, object co-segmentation is also implemented as the segment-tube spatio-temporal detector. Inspired by the recent spatio-temporal action localization efforts with tubelets (sequences of bounding boxes), Le et al. present a new spatio-temporal action localization detector Segment-tube, which consists of sequences of per-frame segmentation masks. This Segment-tube detector can temporally pinpoint the starting/ending frame of each action category in the presence of preceding/subsequent interference actions in untrimmed videos. Simultaneously, the Segment-tube detector produces per-frame segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes, offering superior spatial accuracy to tubelets. This is achieved by alternating iterative optimization between temporal action localization and spatial action segmentation. The proposed segment-tube detector is illustrated in the flowchart on the right. The sample input is an untrimmed video containing all frames in a pair figure skating video, with only a portion of these frames belonging to a relevant category (e.g., the DeathSpirals). Initialized with saliency based image segmentation on individual frames, this method first performs temporal action localization step with a cascaded 3D CNN and LSTM, and pinpoints the starting frame and the ending frame of a target action with a coarse-to-fine strategy. Subsequently, the segment-tube detector refines per-frame spatial segmentation with graph cut by focusing on relevant frames identified by the temporal action localization step. The optimization alternates between the temporal action localization and spatial action segmentation in an iterative manner. Upon practical convergence, the final spatio-temporal action localization results are obtained in the format of a sequence of per-frame segmentation masks (bottom row in the flowchart) with precise starting/ending frames.

At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, it was one of the cities of Thessaly that supplied aid to the Athenians. At the end of the 4th century BCE, it was united (synoecism) with the neighboring cities of Phylace and Phthiotic Thebes to form a polis. The new conurbation took the name of Phthiotic Thebes, and became the main city of the Achaean Phthiotis League until it joined the Aetolian League at the end of the 3rd century BCE. Professor John Grainger of the University of Birmingham concluded, from evidence relating to the election of men from Thebes to office in the Aetolian League, that the city became a member of the League in the 220s BCE.John D. Grainger, The League of the Aitolians (p.239), Brill (1999) Until the construction of Demetrias by Demetrius Poliorcetes, it was the main port of the Pagasetic Gulf. It was destroyed in 217 BCE by the army of Philip V of Macedon,Homero, Ilíada, edición de José García Blanco y Luis M. Macía Aparicio p.85, nota complementaria, Madrid: CSIC, 1991. and its inhabitants were enslaved and the city became a Macedonian colony. The site of Pyrasus is within the limits of Nea Anchialos. The only excavation that took place on the hill of Magoula, the ancient acropolis, southeast of Nea Anchialos, shows that the place was inhabited since the Neolithic (sixth millennium BCE) by fishermen and farmers. Stählin found a walled circuit covered by Byzantine remains near the top of the hill, and other walls similar at its foot. Archaeological remains are scarce and the city is barely known in historical times. An arm of a large statue, which came to light in 1965, was attributed to Demeter. Possibly the most important finding is a small fragment of an old epigraph, discovered in the remains of the great Basilica D with the name Pyrasus, which confirms the location of the town.

Biography Zydower was born in 1930 in a small village in the Galicia region which at that time was within the borders of Germany. As a Jewish family, the Zydowers faced discrimination and oppression under the Nazi government so in 1939 the three Zydower children were evacuated to Britain on the last Kindertransport train to leave the territory before the start of World War II. During The Holocaust both of Zydower's parents were deported to and then killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In England the three Zydower children were taken into foster care by a Quaker family, the Freemans, in Sheffield. At first unable to speak English, Astrid Zydower struggled at school but did show a talent for drawing and went on to study at Sheffield School of Art. From there she won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London where, from 1952 to 1957, she was taught sculpture by first Frank Dobson then John Skeaping and attended Leon Underwood's drawing classes. When she graduated Zydower was offered a job as an assistant to Jacob Epstein but refused the role as she had already been commissioned to work on the Observer Film Exhibition and the Telford Bicentenary Exhibition by Richard Buckle. Virgin and Child; part of the Nativity installed at Lincoln Cathedral In 1958 Zydower completed eleven busts of English literary figures for the Brussels World Fair. During the 1960s, Zydower taught at the Hornsey School of Art in north London and undertook a number of high profile, and often very large, sculpture commissions. In 1964, for the 400th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare, she completed a series of life-size figures for Stratford, Ontario. 45 figures by Zydower were commissioned for the British Pavilion at the Expo '67 world trade fair in Montreal and she subsequently produced works for Expo '70 in Osaka. Among Zydower's students at Hornsey was Shirley Ann Shepherd, the wife of Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones drummer. This led to a number of commissions for Zydower from Watts and other members of the band. For Watts she produced a bust of Ulysses and for Mick Jagger a head of Actaeon. Other commissions included a 1968 figure of Lord Mountbatten as the Viceroy of India and a memorial bronze of Winston Churchill for the Sultan of Brunei. She produced a large Nativity scene for St Paul's Cathedral which was displayed there each Christmas for many years until it was transferred to Lincoln Cathedral. For the Museum of the Jewish Dispora in Tel- Aviv, Zydower created a scene of group of ten men, a minyan, preparing to enter a prayer room. A 1970 commission to create a bronze bust of Dame Marie Rambert, founder of the Ballet Rambert, led to a lifelong friendship and several other studies of ballet dancers, including members of the New York City Ballet. In 1984, for the fountain on the central terrace of Harewood House in Yorkshire Zydower created a nine foot high bronze of Orpheus carrying a leopard. In later life she concentrated on etching, mainly of figures from Greek mythology, rather than sculpture. Works by Zydower are held in both the Victoria & Albert Museum and the National Portrait Gallery in London. In 1968 she was awarded an MBE and for many years lived in a large house, that contained her studio, in Kentish Town in north London and it was there that she died in 2005.

Promoted to the rank of sebastos, he served as doux of Dyrrhachium from 1106 until after 1108. During this time, he led the successful resistance to a siege of Dyrrhachium by Bohemond I of Antioch, leading to the Treaty of Devol. Life Born , Alexios was the second son and third child of the sebastokrator Isaac Komnenos, older brother of Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (), and his wife Irene of Alania. As an imperial relative, he bore the title of sebastos. Almost the only details about his life come from the Alexiad, written by his cousin, Anna Komnene. He is first mentioned in the spring of 1106, when he was appointed by his uncle as the military governor (doux) of Dyrrhachium, replacing his older brother John. His earlier life and career are unknown, but it is likely that he had previously held other public posts, just like John, who held his first office at the age of 19. At some point, probably around 1094, he married a certain Zoe, whose family is unknown. The Byzantine-era city walls of Dyrrhachium (modern Durrës, Albania) The post of governor of Dyrrhachium was of major importance. The city was of great importance to the Byzantine Empire, as the \\"key of Albania\\" and the main point of entry from Italy into the Balkans, a fact illustrated by the role it played in the Norman invasion in the early years of Alexios I's reign. John had proven himself unreliable, having been accused of plotting against the emperor and suffering a defeat at the hands of the Dalmatians. With the threat of another Norman invasion looming, Emperor Alexios confided this crucial post to Alexios instead, in whom he evidently placed greater trust. At the same time, the emperor continued sending letters to his nephew, impressing upon him the need to keep constant watch on the coasts for the first sign of a Norman invasion. Indeed, in October 1107, Bohemond I of Antioch, emulating his father Robert Guiscard, landed with a strong army at Avlona. Alexios, who had diligently implemented his uncle's instructions, immediately sent news to him. Bohemond laid siege to Dyrrhachium in November 1107, which lasted until the next spring. The Normans employed a large number of siege engines, but the defenders held firm, using Greek fire to destroy them. Anna Komnene praises Alexios' leadership, both for his bravery and for the inspiration he provided to his men. In the meantime, the situation of the besiegers worsened as Emperor Alexios sent detachments to occupy the various passes and prevent the Normans from foraging, while he moved with his army to Devol to await an opportunity to strike against them. As famine, disease, and desertions plagued the Norman army, Bohemond sent envoys to Alexios to negotiate. On instructions from his uncle, Alexios forwarded the envoys to the Emperor, leading to the conclusion of the Treaty of Devol in which Bohemond acknowledged the Emperor's suzerainty and became his vassal. Alexios' subsequent life and career are unknown, as is the date of his death. According to Theodore Balsamon, his wife fell heavily ill shortly after 1130 to a disease deemed incurable by her physicians. In desperation, her family turned to foreign charlatans, who claimed that her illness was due to spells, and proceeded to discover clay poppets, blaming her servants and entourage. The latter were interrogated and even tortured, but to no avail, as the charlatans were responsible for planting these dolls themselves. In the end, as they proved unable to improve her condition, they fled the palace. Some of her relatives and servants who participated in these events were later punished for believing in and abetting sorcery by Patriarch Leo Styppes. The couple probably had a son, named John, known from a single funerary poem, who was a distinguished military commander.

The siege is described at length in the Alexiad of Anna Komnene, daughter of Emperor Alexios. Emperor Alexios, who had been heavily defeated while trying to relieve a previous Norman siege of the same city in 1081, now allowed the siege to wear on and avoided a pitched battle, while dispatching detachments of his army to occupy the passes in the Normans' rear, thus preventing them from foraging.

She was a member of Cumann na mBan, serving as a member of the executive committee in 1921. She had been engaged to Pierce McCann, but he died of influenza in Gloucester jail in March 1919. She married James McNeill in 1923, while he was serving as Irish high commissioner in London. Despite her reservations, McNeill became a noted hostess, both in London and later in Dublin when her husband became the Governor-General of the Irish Free State from 1928 to 1932. Diplomatic work After the death of her husband in 1938, McNeill became the honorary secretary of the council of the Friends of the National Collections, as well as serving as chair of the executive committee of the Irish Countrywomen's Association until 1950. As a member of the Department of External Affairs advisory committee on cultural relations she wrote on economic, social and cultural issues. She represented Ireland at the UNESCO general assembly in Paris in 1949. McNeill was an active member of Clann na Poblachta from its foundation in 1946. She was appointed the minister to the Netherlands in 1950 by Seán MacBride, making her the first Irish female diplomat to represent Ireland abroad in a ministerial capacity. This appointment was not well received by diplomats in the Department of External Affairs. Her reports from The Hague focused on the issues the Netherlands faced with decolonisation. In 1955 she became the minister to Sweden, going on to hold the joint appointment to Austria and Switzerland from 1956 to 1960, after which she retired. While serving in Switzerland she put aside the resentment she felt towards Éamon de Valera based on how he had treated her husband, to sit with him during a convalescence while de Valera recovered from an eye operation. Later life McNeill was an amateur pianist and collected paintings and porcelains. In 1933 she published the Irish language book, Finnsgéalta ó India. She died in St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin on 19 November 1969, and is buried in Kilbarrack cemetery. Her papers are held in the UCD Archives.

While most industries are dependent in some way on knowledge as inputs, knowledge industries are particularly dependent on knowledge and technology to generate revenue. Some industries that are included in this category include education, consulting, science, finance, insurance, health service, and communications. The term \\"knowledge industry\\" was suggested by Austrian-American economist Fritz Machlup to describe these industries in the context of his new idea of the knowledge economy.Nelson, Richard R. \\"Role of Knowledge in Economic Growth.\\" Science 140, no. 3566 (1963): 473-74. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1710809.  Emergence  The production of knowledge before the Scientific Revolution had little economic impact and was practiced on a small scale. Since that time knowledge has become one of the largest and most important industrial sectors in world commerce. The emergence of knowledge as an industry has been essential in perpetuating the modern capitalist system. A modern capitalist economy relies on continuously developing and changing technology. Where pre- modern economies tended to cater to specific fixed needs, a modern economy functions by creating new needs to create sustainable profits. The knowledge industry is the main creator of needs in modern economic systems and thus plays a vital role in such systems. Though knowledge industries had been emerging as an important sector of the modern economy, it was not until the 1960s that much study was done on knowledge as a resource or on the roles it plays in industry. Austrian-American economist Fritz Machlup first proposed and popularized the ideas of knowledge industries and the knowledge economy in his 1962 book The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States. Since the publication of that book, many economists have begun to refine the idea of the knowledge industry. For example, to better research the effect of knowledge industries on the economy at large some economists have created sub-categories within knowledge industries. To study the effect of knowledge industry on the Canadian economy over time, Canadian economists split up the various knowledge industries into categories of low-, medium-, and high-knowledge industries. These categories took into account various attributes of these industries such as wages, proportion of capital spent on research and development, and the proportion of workers with university degrees. Examples = Education = As a knowledge industry, education accounted for around 30% of the Gross National Product in the United States in the late 1960s. Schools contribute greatly to both the production and intake of knowledge and play a large role in the economy. While it is difficult to quantify the economics of education it can still be easily shown that schools are economic units as they use resources to achieve their goals. Schools also have the important economic characteristics of a business in that they employ people to work for them. Additionally, as globalization has increased its influence in all aspects of the economy, higher education has become more tuned to supporting commercial goals, often to the detriment of the non-profit and public sectors. = Communications = The communications industry, including telecommunications, is an important knowledge industry and is characterized as a \\"medium-knowledge service\\".Gera, Surendra, and Kurt Mang. \\"The Knowledge-Based Economy: Shifts in Industrial Output.\\" Canadian Public Policy / Analyse De Politiques 24, no. 2 (1998): 149-84. doi:10.2307/3551772. Knowledge growth in the communications industry is generally produced by research and development. It is referred to as a medium-knowledge service because of its lower levels of investment in knowledge workers than the high- knowledge services like medicine, education, and the aerospace industry. = Health and medical products = The pharmaceutical industry is a major knowledge industry. In many ways this industry typifies the high-knowledge industries as much of its resources are invested heavily in highly skilled and educated researchers. As a result of the skill and time necessary to develop medications and medical products, pharmaceutical companies employ highly educated people who command high wages.

He is known for his satirical video works, most notably Studio Visit (2005) and Saint Henry Composition (2001), unique exhibition installations such as A Painted Horse by Joe Sola (with Matthew Chambers, Sayre Gomez, Rudy K. Slobeck, and others), (2015) and Portraits: an exhibition in Tif Sigfrids’ ear (2013), as well as his collaborative performances with composer Michael Webster.  Life and education  Sola was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1966. He studied American Literature at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, graduating with a B.A. in 1989. He went on to study at Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles, California, receiving his M.F.A in 1999.  Work  Sola's works flirt with disaster. Working with video, painting, installation and performance, Sola's practice merges the absurd with cultural critique, referencing both high and low culture found in Hollywood, German philosophy, adult entertainment, and art history. His works, which often use cinematic imagery, question notions of authenticity and aspects of masculinity within contemporary society, prompting viewers to “consider the impact popular culture has on our contemporary psyche\\". Using himself, other artists, non-artists, high school football players, professional actors, bodybuilders and models, Sola muddles the boundaries between conceptual art, Hollywood film, performance and social experiment. Such examples include: Employing car salesmen to sell his paintings at an art fair (Car Salesmen Selling my Paintings at Art Los Angeles Contemporary Art Fair, 2015); Getting tackled by high school football players (Saint Henry Composition, 2001); Explaining his drawings to escorts (Talking about my Drawings with Escorts, 2010); Inviting film actors to make conceptual art (Film Actors Make Conceptual Art, 2005); Installing miniature paintings into his dealer's ear (Portraits: an Exhibition in Tif Sigfrids’ Ear, 2013). In 2014, he turned his art gallery into a collectors dining room and hung abstract paintings by contemporary artists on the walls. For Sola's contribution he painted an abstract pattern on a miniature horse and allowed the horse to roam free in the gallery during business hours. For his contribution to the 2002 California Biennial Sola contributed a short documentary video of a ride over the climax of a roller coaster with leading professional actors from the gay adult film industry (Riding with adult video performers, 2002). Studio Visit In one of his earlier works, Studio Visit (2005) captures the vulnerability of hosting studio visits. In this piece Sola invites guests to discuss recent artworks and exhibitions, at one point asking them if they would like to see a new performance he does in the studio. He mentions that what they are about to see is art, and then unexpectedly jumps through the window. The onlookers stay seated, stunned, then get up to check if the artist is still alive, while others laugh, realizing the hilarity of it all. Referencing both Yves Klein's Leap into the Void (1960) and Hollywood action films, the short 8-minute video reflects Sola's engagement with Hollywood while also capturing the vulnerability of being an artist and the struggle to communicate with words during a studio visit. Portraits: an exhibition in Tif Sigfrids' ear In 2013, Sola presented Portraits: an exhibition in Tif Sigfrids’ ear, the first of several exhibitions the artist made with the gallery over the course of several years. For this exhibition Sola created six miniature oil paintings using a stereo microscope and a .12-millimeter acupuncture needle. Measuring 4/64 - 5/64 inches, the paintings were installed within a miniature white box gallery, which the gallerist then displayed within her ear for the duration of the exhibition. The entire space of the gallery remained empty, except for the gallerist sitting at her desk. The exhibition earned notable attention, cementing Sola “among the savviest of today’s art-court jesters.\\" For his second exhibition at the gallery in 2014, Sola presented Painted Horse by Joe Sola (with Matthew Chambers, Sayre Gomez, Rudy K. Slobeck, and others). Turning the entire gallery into a fictional art collector's dining room, the exhibition included works by artists Matthew Chambers, Sayre Gomez, Rudy K. Slobeck as well as a miniature horse, Riba, which Sola painted in abstract shapes with pink, purple and yellow vegetable dye. The exhibition was said to provoke “dialogue about the economics of collecting”. In his 2016 exhibition Mertzbau: An Exhibition by Joe Sola Featuring Albert Mertz, 419 salvaged wooden chairs were installed within the small gallery. The chairs were stacked high so as to create three tunnels, and at the end of each one was a work by the artist Albert Mertz. Inspired by the artist Kurt Schwitters's grand work Merzbau (1937), the title serves as a play on references, captured in a quote by Schwitters that was displayed in the window of the gallery: “Being active in several different art forms was a matter of necessity for me as an artist. My goal with the ‘Merzkunst’ was the total work of art that comprises all other forms of art in one artistic unity.” Joe Sola and Michael Webster performing as Shakey's at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles. Since 2006, Sola has also collaborated with composer Michael Webster as the duo Shakey's. The performances combine comedy, art historical critique and slapstick silent-movie gestures. They have been presented at art venues such as the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, as well as within self-enclosed installation that invited visitors to put their heads into peep-holes in order to see the show (Shakey’s Mining Adventure, 2007). In 2013, Sola presented Shakey's in 'Der Hintern in Der Luft at 356 Mission in Los Angeles. Dressed as vaudevillian restaurant servers, Sola danced, drew, sculpted, made a sandwich, threw a knife, then a hatchet, then an axe, started and extinguished a fire, culminating in Sola and Webster putting the entire show, including a large Laura Owens painting, through a 1000-pound woodchipper on stage.

A music-themed game, it follows The Bard, a wandering singer, as they go on a quest to gather pieces of a song that will save their world from destruction. In the game, the player uses The Bard's singing to affect the environment, solve puzzles, and defend against enemies. Developed in GameMaker Studio, the game was inspired by Lobanov's experiences on a cross-country bike trip across the United States and juxtaposes a positive atmosphere and protagonist with an apocalyptic setting. Games such as Kirby's Epic Yarn and animated cartoons such as Over the Garden Wall and Steven Universe inspired the game's tone, pace, and art style. The game's audio was co-produced with A Shell in the Pit; Gordon McGladdery, who worked on Duelyst, Parkitect, and Rogue Legacy, composed the game's music and Em Halberstadt, who worked on Night in the Woods, directed the game's sound design. Wandersong was released on macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo Switch in September 2018, PlayStation 4 in January 2019, and Xbox One in December 2019.  Gameplay  Wandersong is a side-scrolling puzzle and adventure game that uses music as a puzzle-solving mechanic. The player character can sing to cause events to occur in the environment around them, using a coloured \\"song wheel\\" with eight directions, each representing musical notes spanning an octave, which is controlled by the mouse on a computer setup, or the right thumbstick on a controller. Certain challenges in the game involve the player matching notes or tunes with a non-player character's song, similar to a typical rhythm game. Functions that allow the player to perform dances also exist, but do not actually serve a purpose in gameplay. Wandersong is set in a universe created by a goddess named Eya who \\"sang the universe into existence.\\" Every epoch, Eya sings a brand new song that destroys the universe and creates a new one. The player character, known as The Bard, makes an attempt to gather the pieces of the \\"Earthsong\\", a composition that, when sung, will allow the universe to be preserved. The game is estimated to be 11 hours in length.  Plot  The game is broken up into a prologue and then seven acts, each with a variety of \\"scenes\\" in them. In the prologue, the main character, a bard is having a dream. They see a sword and try to pick it up to fight a monster, but ultimately fail. They see the messenger of the god, Eya, and she tells them that the world is ending, and that they didn't pass the test and aren't \\"The Hero.\\" In Act One, the bard wakes up from their dream in their home, near the town of Langtree. When they arrive at Langtree, they find many different ghosts are haunting it, but they can calm them down with their singing. From the oldest woman of the village, Ruby, they learn the Overseer Song which will enable them to visit the overseer, a minor god and protector of a certain area. They then try to go meet with the Dream King, the overseer of Langtree, and while in the spirit world sees the messenger again. She tells them about the Earthsong, a legendary song which the bard can gather from different pieces given by all the Overseers of the world which might be able to save the world. The Dream King doesn't give them the part of the song he has, but does give the bard the ability to communicate with other Overseers and ghosts. They return to Langtree and finish saving it from the ghosts, now able to communicate with them. They find out that the ghosts are the dead relatives of the townsfolk, who wanted to see their families before the world ended. In Act Two, the bard meets Miriam and her grandmother Sapphy, who are witches. Sapphy sends Miriam, a loner who is constantly frustrated by the bard's singing, to assist them in saving the world by collecting the pieces of the Earthsong. They go through a cave of trolls, and find that one of them had a curse cast upon them by an evil human. The bard tries to break the curse with singing but doesn't succeed. They then arrive at the neighboring town of Delphi. There the bard meets Manny, a drummer who's trying to put together a band, and gathers the band members of Ash and Viola. They all perform and are wildly successful. Ash then comes out and performs the Overseer song. The bard then goes through the spirit world and gets the Queen of Winds' part of the Earthsong. Afterwards, the bard returns to the troll-cave and cures the cursed troll, before setting sail on the ocean. In Act Three, the bard and Miriam are sailing on a ship of coffee-trading pirates. They meet Captain Lucas, who wants to try and find the mermaids who disappeared a long time ago. A fortune teller tells the bard that the mermaids know the Overseer song. One of the people who lives on the island they stop on, Markus, captures and imprisons the whole crew, but the bard manages to talk him out of it. The bard and Captain Lucas then find and meet the mermaids, and they give the bard the Overseer song. The bard visits the spirit world and sees the Queen Chaos, but before they can get the overseer song she is killed by Audrey Redheart, the Hero. Despite that, they obtain the Earthsong piece from her dead body, being able to talk to ghosts. In the Intermission, the user briefly plays as The Hero who kills the Queen of Winds, another Overseer. In Act Four, the bard is depressed and wakes up in their mothers house in the town of Chimest. Everyone in the town is sad because they're all forced to work in the factory or with an extension of the factory, run by The Baron, and what it produces, Happy Kid dolls. Miriam figured out the Overseer song and how to access the spirit world, but is unable to because of the pollutants from the factory. The bard teams up with the local astronomer and gathers a team of Winston, Miriam, and Peter, who has fallen in love with Miriam, though she does not reciprocate the love. Together the four of them take down the factory, and go see The Baron, who truly wanted to make everyone in the world happy by making the Happy Kid dolls, but didn't realize he was simply making everyone miserable. The factory shuts down and people are a lot happier. The bard then goes into the spirit world and finds that Queen Order isn't sitting on her throne, as the Dream King is on it, trying to avoid The Hero, who is killing Overseers. The Hero kills Queen Order, but the Dream King escapes. From communicating with Queen Order's spirit the bard learns the next part of the song. In Act Five, there is a war between two neighboring kingdoms, Rulle and Chaandesh. The citizens of Rulle all have spirit pets, and the citizens of Chaandesh are all witches. Giant monsters are appearing and terrorizing the inhabitants of both nations. A ghost gives the bard a message to deliver to the King of Rulle, and as such the bard and Miriam head to Xiatian, the capitol city. Along the way they save a near-empty town called Lumber Town, inhabited only by the infirm and elderly who were unable to make the journey to the capitol, from a swarm of monsters. There they sing a song about a wayfarer who comes across a witch and they fall in love, but the witch curses the wayfarer and steals her soul, although they are in love, showing the distrust of witches by Rulle citizens, but also slightly reflecting the bard and Miriam's relationship, which causes Miriam to be sad. When they arrive at Xiatian, the find the hero has already arrived and is idolized by the town for defeating giant monsters and saving the city. They realize that in order to meet the King they have to go with the Hero, who lets them come along as long as they provide her with a potion of strength. Miriam cooks up a possibly faulty potion of strength, but gives it to her regardless as she dislikes the Hero. When they see the King, he reveals they're going to invade Chaandesh in three days. The ghost inside the bard sings a message imploring him to seek peace, before the bard passes out. When he wakes up Miriam is flying them across the border and reveals that they were thrown in prison there, and are now going to the nexus point in order to access the spirit world. Miriam plays the Overseer song on her piccolo, but the messenger reveals that there is a second part, held by the queen of Chaandesh. They then fly over the border, but are knocked down by magic from \\"the Spell Squad\\", a defense force against the monster consisting of two witches, Vivian and Sandra. The bard and Miriam team up with them to fight some monsters, and they then put them on a boat which will take them to the capital city, Mohabumi. On the boat the bard learns that the spirit inhabiting him is Hala, a deceased Chaandesh princess. He also puts on a performance with the musicians there. The capital city is inside a mountain, and on account that everyone inhabiting it is a witch, requires magic to get around. The bard learns that magic is just a form of singing, and uses that to be able to cast very primal spells to get around the city. There the bard sees the band from Delphi, who are ecstatic to see him, and are putting on a performance with a new singer. While at the concert Miriam reveals she always felt out of place and lonely being a witch, and expected to feel accepted here, but doesn't as much as she thought. She says that she's just going to dance and be herself for a bit. The bard goes to see the Queen and Hala makes an appeal to her to stop the fighting, as it's all a misunderstanding. The Queen rebuffs them, but Purnima, one of Hala's sisters, teaches them the Overseer song. The bard and Miriam enter the spirit world, but are separated, and find things are in disarray, and the spirit world is being pulled together and is collapsing. The Hero shows up and knocks out Miriam. The two Overseers then fight and destroy each other. In the aftermath of that the bard learns two parts of the song from their spirits, and following that the spirit world ends. Having carried Miriam out of the spirit world, the bard sings a song to both nations, bringing them together and making them understand one another, ending the war. Miriam was badly injured by the Hero and decides she is unable to go on, instead she will return to see her grandmother as the end of the world draws nearer. The bard continues on alone. In Act Six, the bard climbs Ichor Mountain, at the top of which is the King of Hearts. Along the way he finds the Heart of Eya Temple, with some monks remaining in it, awaiting the world's end. With the help of bird, bugs, and flying seals the bard makes it up to the top of the mountain. At the top they find the King of Hearts has been overtaken by darkness. The Hero shows up, attempting to kill it, but drinks the defective strength potion and is weakened. Both the Hero and the bard are knocked out back to a cave partway down the mountain, and the Hero loses her sword. There, with the help of the bugs the bard befriended earlier, they make it out of the cave, but the bard makes Audrey promise not to kill the King of Hearts. They find the King of Hearts again, and the Hero finds her sword and kills him, breaking her promise. The bard gets the Earthsong from his body before returning to Langtree. In Act Seven, the bard returns to Langtree to find that it is unrecognizable, nearly completely destroyed with all the citizens awaiting the world's end. They reencounter Miriam, who says she feels bad for leaving them. Miriam now fully accepts and is happy with her friendship with the bard. The two reunite and set off for the Dream Castle, which is now completely in the real world after the spirit world collapsed. They reencounter the Dream King who reveals to them that the end isn't going to happen soon, but is happening, and that the end is the people moving apart from one another and everyone losing hope. He says that the Earthsong can't stop that, and only something that unites everyone in harmony can do that. He says their quest is hopeless. Suddenly, the Hero appears and tries to strike down the Dream King. The bard and Miriam work together to stop the Hero from killing her, with Miriam finally stealing her sword. The Hero tells them that she was chosen and she was the special one, and she has to do this because she is the Hero. The bard tries to convince her otherwise, saying she would be special no matter what. Regardless, the Hero uses her scarf to reclaim her sword and kills the Dream King. The world becomes entirely black and white, but a bell rings out in the darkness. The bard sings, reaching out with his voice to everyone across the world, and everyone responds in harmony. The world returns to color and is saved. The messenger tells them that the bard didn't sing the Earthsong, but sang something different yet also special, which united everyone in the world and harmonized with Eya's song, saving the world. Miriam then takes the bard all around the world to all different parts of his journey to reunite with his friends. Finally, he returns to Langtree where he has dinner with Sapphy and Miriam. The bard says to Miriam although it's goodbye for now, they still will be friends. They hug each other, and then the bard goes home.  Development  Wandersong was developed in GameMaker Studio by Greg Lobanov, who had also built a custom level editor and audio editor to create the game. It marks Lobanov's return to story-driven games, a milestone that had been a goal of his after years of learning game design skills developing games such as Perfection and Coin Crypt. Development on the game started in October 2015, and was inspired by a cross-country bike trip Lobanov took across the United States from October 2014 to March 2015. Lobanov wanted to translate the \\"feel of that journey\\", where he had met various people and felt overwhelmed by their perceived kindness and generosity. Lobanov originally went for a more literal interpretation of the cross-country bike trip that inspired him, developing games about biking. He was ultimately dissatisfied with these early concepts, feeling that they were \\"missing the spirit of the trip\\", and opted to create a game with a \\"really hippy, dopey, joyful rainbow message\\" that resembled his experiences on the trip. Lobanov's tenure in the \\"Indie House\\" in Vancouver, British Columbia early in development had an influence on the game's direction, as Lobanov shared his ideas with, and received feedback from, fellow game developers. Wandersong was funded through a Kickstarter campaign that successfully raised US$21,936 from 989 contributors in February 2016. colourblind or deaf players to solve the game's puzzles. Lobanov invented the game's \\"song wheel\\" mechanic as a way to encourage the player to experiment with the environment, as opposed to the specificity of other music- related mechanics in games such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The wheel was designed with accessibility in mind; Lobanov designed Wandersong so that the solutions to puzzles would always be hinted at through direction, rather than sound and colour alone, allowing players with color blindness or hearing loss to solve the game's puzzles. The introduction of new uses of the song wheel in each of the game's puzzle areas complements the absence of a consistently rising difficulty curve, allowing the game to also be accessible to players with a lower skill set in puzzle solving. Many puzzles in Wandersong were reworked from their initial, more complex iterations, after game testers and patrons at conventions, where the game was showcased during development, found them difficult or hard to understand. The game's \\"paper cutout\\" art style is primarily inspired by Kirby's Epic Yarn and its \\"physical feeling\\", the simplicity of which was also easier for Lobanov to work with as the game's sole programmer and artist. Characters flip over like paper when changing direction in the game's two-dimensional art style. The game's visuals have drawn comparisons by observers to The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and the Paper Mario series. Its story, which Lobanov had planned the beginning and ending of from the start of development, is mostly constructed out of spontaneous ideas Lobanov had during development based on the game's core mechanic of singing, which were made easier to implement through the custom level editor and the minimalist art style. The apocalyptic setting of Wandersong is juxtaposed with an optimistic and positive atmosphere. Lobanov felt that a completely positive atmosphere would result in a \\"really empty experience\\", and decided to add tension through \\"really dark, scary, big things\\" to the game's story and opposing it with a \\"carefree, happy response\\" from The Bard. The game's non-intimidating tone and pace was informed by animated cartoons that incorporated music, such as Over the Garden Wall and Steven Universe. The cartoons also served as a reference for the game's animations. = Audio = The game's soundtrack was created by Lobanov and Gordon McGladdery, who is the director of A Shell in the Pit, a video game sound design and music production company known for their work on indie games such as Duelyst, Parkitect, and Rogue Legacy. Lobanov, who had not been traditionally trained in music, self-taught to compose and perform music for the game. Lobanov enlisted the help of McGladdery early in development after talking with and considering various composers. Lobanov's admiration of McGladdery's musical style and the convenience of both of them being located in Vancouver had attracted him to McGladdery. Early in development, the composition of music for particular levels and scenes in the game would take place after the level or scene was completed, with changes to the level or scene also being implemented to better fit with the music composed. An eight- track extended play featuring McGladdery's music for the game entitled Wandersong: Dreams & Wonder was released on November 8, 2017, and a 7\\" single limited to 750 copies featuring the tracks \\"Sailing with the Coffee Pirates\\" and \\"Dreamscape\\" was released by Yetee Records on May 17, 2018. The game's sound design was produced in REAPER by A Shell in the Pit's Em Halberstadt, who previously worked on Night in the Woods as a sound designer. The game was a departure from Halberstadt's ambient style and foley production for Night in the Woods and employed a more musical direction that also involved character voices. For each sound effect in Wandersong, an entire scale of variations were created in Kontakt to fit the scale of the background music that it would appear with.  Release  Wandersong was one of the first GameMaker Studio productions released on the Nintendo Switch. Wandersong was showcased at GDC 2016, PAX West 2016, PAX West 2017, Day of the Devs 2017, and PAX West 2018. The game was published by Humble Bundle's publishing imprint \\"Presented by Humble Bundle\\", and released on September 27, 2018, on macOS and Microsoft Windows through the Humble Bundle store and Steam, and on Nintendo Switch through the Nintendo eShop. It was part of the first wave of games to be released with the GameMaker Studio 2 Nintendo Switch license, with Hyper Light Drifter and Undertale also being released for the Switch in September. The game was later released on PlayStation 4 via the PlayStation Store on January 22, 2019, Microsoft Windows via the Microsoft Store as a launch title for Xbox Game Pass for PC on June 9, 2019, and Xbox One via the Microsoft Store on December 6, 2019. On Xbox One, the game was also made available through Xbox Game Pass for Console. Wandersong saw a troubled release on Steam, as the game was erroneously tagged for review under Valve's policies against games that intentionally inflated users' statistics, such as achievements and trading card progression. Trading cards and achievements for Wandersong were inaccessible to players, who could not add the game to their \\"favorite games\\" lists as a result of the policy until January 9, 2019, when Valve, the developers of Steam, contacted Lobanov via email, describing the error as a glitch in which Steam did not update the game's store page correctly. Sales of the game on Steam were not impacted by the error. Reception =Accolades= Wandersong was named the 9th best Nintendo Switch game of 2018 and the 13th best PC game of 2018 by the magazine Paste. At the 2019 Independent Games Festival, Wandersong was nominated for Excellence in Narrative, and received honorable mentions for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Excellence in Visual Art, and Excellence in Audio. It was also nominated for the \\"Game, Original Family\\" award at the 2019 NAVGTR Awards, and for Most Fulfilling Community-Funded Game at the 2019 SXSW Gaming Awards. At the 2019 G.A.N.G. Awards, Wandersong was nominated for Best Interactive Score and Best Sound Design for an Indie Game.

A number of guns were also converted to railway guns during World War I in order to meet the need for heavy artillery and these were also used in World War II. Design The Canon de 19 C modèle 1870/93 were typical built-up guns of the period with mixed construction consisting of a rifled steel liner and several layers of iron reinforcing hoops. In French service guns of mixed steel/iron construction were designated in centimeters while all steel guns were designated in millimeters. However, reference materials don't always distinguish the difference in construction and use either unit of measurement. The guns used a de Bange breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The mle 1870/93 was mounted on a mle 1886 center pivot mount with a rectangular steel firing platform which sat on top of a large diameter geared steel ring set into a concrete slab behind a parapet with the barrel of the gun overhanging the parapet at the front and an overhanging loading platform to the rear. The mounts allowed high angles of elevation +30° with 360° of traverse. The mount was traversed by a worm gear which attached to the base. The recoil system for the mle 1870/93 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffer slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. Railway guns =World War I= Twenty-six mle 1893-1896 guns were converted to Canon de 19 modèle 1870/93 TAZ railway guns during the first world war. The guns were mounted in a large turret on an armored railroad carriage built by Schneider. =World War II= Twenty-four mle 1870/93 TAZ railway guns were mobilized at the beginning of the second world war. After the fall of France, nine guns were used by the Germans as coastal defense artillery under the designation 19 cm K(E) 486(f). The Kingdom of Italy also received twelve guns after the Armistice of Villa Incisa and these were given the designation Cannone da 194/29 Modello 70/93. They were integrated into armored trains of the Royal Italian Army and assigned coastal defense duties. Their only action was 13 March 1944 with the Italian Co-belligerent Army during the Battle of Montelungo.

He was deputy to the governor general of the French Antilles, and was twice acting governor general of the French Antilles. In his last year he was governor of Saint-Domingue Early years Gabriel-Jean Nicolas Gabaret was born on 18 August 1641 in Saint-Martin-de-Ré, Charente-Maritime. His parents were Mathurin Gabaret (1602–1671), a lieutenant general of the marine army and Marie Baron. On 10 April 1673 he married Marie-Anne Grassineau des Enfrais des Essarts in La Rochelle, Charente-Maritime. They had seven children. Through his marriage he became seigneur of Saint-Sornin(fr) in the department of Vendée. Their son, also Gabriel-Jean-Nicolas de Gabaret, inherited the chateau of Saint-Sornin. Governor of Grenada Gabaret was appointed the king's governor of Grenada in 1680. Gabaret was a shareholder in the Mouillage sugar refinery on Martinique, as was the marquis de Maintenon. By 1683 they were both being named in complaints about illegal trade in the islands. One common approach was to load sugar in Martinique, declare the amount being exported to the local customs official, sail to the English part of Saint Christopher island and sell it, then replace it with sugar from the French part of the island and continue to France. The king knew of the illegal trade but could do nothing to enforce the laws. Governor of Martinique In July 1689 the king made Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut governor of Saint Christopher Island and gave him the position of lieutenant general of the American islands, which had been vacated by the death of Claude de Roux de Saint- Laurent. On 16 June 1689 Louis XIV made Gabaret governor of Martinique in place of Guitaut. Gabaret installed the Saint-Nicolas battery to protect the bay of Saint-Pierre. In 1693 Gabaret and the governor general Charles de Courbon de Blénac repulsed the English when they attempted invasion with a force of 4,000 men. The English expedition under Admiral Francis Wheler had 15 warships 3 fire ships, 28 transports and almost 2,000 soldiers, to which Barbados added another 1,000 men. Gabaret was prepared to defend Saint Pierre against the English, but on 11 April 1693 they bypassed the town and continued to the undefended Cul-de-Sac Marin in the southeast of the island. The English took control of a large area with little opposition. English reinforcements under Captain General Christopher Codrington arrived within two weeks, but the combined force did not engage in serious fighting. The English took 3,000 black slaves, valued at £60,000. They made an ineffective attack on Saint Pierre, then left the island. Gabaret was made a chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis in 1701. Acting governor general Charles de Pechpeyrou- Comminges de Guitaut, the acting lieutenant governor of the Antilles, died on 7 September 1702. On 17 September 1702 Gabaret was appointed acting lieutenant governor pending the arrival of Charles-François de Machault de Belmont, who was received in Martinique on 4 March 1703. During the War of the Spanish Succession, on 6 March 1703 an English fleet of 45 vessels carrying 4,000 soldiers and militia arrived off Guadeloupe, which the governor Charles Auger tried to defend against the superior English forces. In late March Machault de Bellemont arrived in Martinique bringing the promotion of Gabaret to second in command of the Antilles (lieutenant du roi au gouvernement général) in place of Guitaut. He found the intendant Robert gathering reinforcements for Guadeloupe. Gabaret reached Guadeloupe with the reinforcements on 3 April 1703 and took command of the defense. His aides de camp were Bonnaventure-François de Boisfermé, governor of Marie-Galante, and two of the king's lieutenants Louis Gaston de Cacqueray de Valmenier and Jean Clair Dyel Du Parquet. Gabaret adopted scorched earth tactics in Guadeloupe, destroying resources before falling back from the invaders into the interior, then harassing them while disease, drink and lack of food reduced their strength. Gabaret's cautious approach gave the English time to cause great damage to the island. The destruction of property was highly unpopular with the planters. It had its effect. The English withdrew their troops on 15 May 1703 and sailed away three days later. Machault died in Martinique on 7 January 1709. Gabaret was again appointed acting governor general. Last years Raymond Balthazar Phélypeaux was appointed governor and lieutenant general of the French islands and mainland, and was received in Martinique on 3 January 1711. Phélypeaux found that Gabaret had allowed the forts and batteries of Martinique to be abandoned for two years. He had work started on restoring the defenses, and when Gabaret opposed his orders he suspended him on 27 April 1711. Gabaret died after he was named governor of Saint Domingue in reward for his services. He died in Saint Domingue on 25 June 1712.

Her films and writing focus on issues of human rights, overlooked periods in history, and Asian-American diaspora. She is well known for her book and film of the same name, Silence Broken: Korean Comfort Women. Both the book and the film are award-winning historical accounts of Korean women forced into sexual servitude by the Japanese army during World War II. She has been recognized and funded by The Rockefeller Fellowship, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the MacArthur Foundation. Her awards and honors include the Asian American Media Arts Award, the Kodak Filmmaker Award, and CINE Golden Eagle. Early life Kim was born in 1938 in Sincheon, Hwanghae Province, in an area which would later become part of North Korea after the division of the peninsula. Kim's early life coincided with the end of Japanese rule in Korea and World War II. During World War II, Korea was forced to support Japan's military, and 200,000 Korean and Chinese women and girls were forced into sexual slavery and labeled as \\"comfort women.\\" The history of Korea during this era has been a frequent subject of Kim's work. At age 7, in 1945, Kim and her family moved across the 38th parallel on foot into South Korea. Her family was deeply committed to the Korean independence movement and to Christianity. =Education= Dai Sil attended the Ewha Girls' High School in Seoul. She went on to obtain her master's degree in Theological Studies from the Methodist Theological Seminary in Seoul in 1960. In 1962 Kim moved to Boston, Massachusetts to attend Boston University, where she obtained her PhD in Religious Studies.

Sa-i-gu is Korean for April 29, the date the Rodney King riot began in Los Angeles in 1992. Sa-I-Gu uses newsreel footage and interviews with Korean-American shopkeepers to tell the story of the King riots from their unique perspective. The film was aired by PBS as part of its independent film series POV (TV series) on September 10, 1993. Her 2004 film Wet Sand: Voices from LA (2004) also deals with the aftermath of the Rodney King riots. Kim-Gibson's third film was released in 1995, titled A Forgotten People: The Sakhalin Koreans. A Forgotten People tells the story of 43,000 Koreans who were brought by the Japanese to Sakhalin Island during World War II for forced labor.

Family Lucas I is the earliest known member of the gens (clan) Péc, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. They originated from Sokoró Hills (Győr County), their ancient clan estate laid in present-day Felpéc and Kajárpéc. Based on the clan's coat-of-arms, it is possible that Lucas was a knight from Western Europe, who arrived to Hungary during the early reign of Andrew II of Hungary. For his military service, he was granted lands in Győr County and the surrounding regions. Lucas I had three sons: George served as ispán of Zala County from 1243 to 1244; Mark I, who was forefather of the Marcali, Berzencei and Szentgyörgyi noble families; and Lucas II (also known as Lucas the Great).Engel: Genealógia (Genus Péc 1. Zala branch) Identification There is a scholarly debate on the difficulty of the identification of Hungarian nobles with the given name \\"Lucas\\", who were active in the 1230s. 19th-century historian Mór Wertner considered all of them as a single person in his various academic works, albeit with various sturdiness. He claimed that all of relevant data refer to a certain Lucas, son of Hippolytus, who is mentioned by a charter in 1206. Wertner connected this individual to the Péc kindred. Subsequently, he slightly modified his viewpoint, and considered Lucas, who functioned as ispán of Hont County, was \\"probably different person\\". Historian Attila Zsoldos analyzed further the question: he separated Lucas, the ispán of the Bakony royal forest too, as its office-holders came from a lower social status in the era. Furthermore, as Zsoldos denoted, the ispán of Moson County was certainly different person from the ispán of Hont County, as they both appeared in the same royal charter in 1239. Attila Zsoldos then considered, there were four (less likely three) different office-bearer nobles with the given name Lucas in the first third of the 13th century: # Lucas, who belonged to the court of King Andrew II. He served as Master of the cupbearers from 1229 to 1230, beside his position of ispán of Bars County. Possibly he is identical with that Lucas, who briefly functioned as ispán of Pozsony County in 1235. Several historians, including Attila Zsoldos and Tamás Kádár considered this baron might be identical with Lucas I Péc, who rose to the Hungarian elite during his decades of service in the court of Andrew II, but rapidly lost political influence, when Béla IV of Hungary ascended the Hungarian throne in 1235. # Lucas, who was a confidant of Duke Béla, who had long opposed his father's land grants and policy. He was Ban of Severin (which belonged to the duke's domain) in 1233, following his predecessor Buzád Hahót's retirement. After Béla's coronation as Hungarian king, he served as ispán of Moson County between 1235 and 1240. It is plausible he was killed during the First Mongol invasion of Hungary. # Lucas, who came from a lower social status (possibly royal servant), and functioned as count of the Bakony royal forest from 1232 to 1233. # Lucas, who was ispán of Hont County from 1237 to 1239. It is possible that he is identical with #1 Lucas (thus plausibly Lucas Péc), who was forced to be satisfied with this relatively insignificant position after Béla IV's enthronement.

The tell then sits along the northern bank of the wadi, which continues flowing west and then turns toward the north. The tell is located along the southern base of a hill known as Jebel el-Qudeirat.See the map on page 2 of Cohen and Bernick-Greenberg (2007). During the Iron Age, Tell el-Qudeirat was a rectangularSee, for example, the title of Ussishkin (1995). fortress, and multiple layers of fortifications have been uncovered.Gilboa et al. (2009), p 82-94 The modern site is a tell, an archaeological mound caused by long-term human habitation. At the lowest level, labelled 4c, are traces of human habitation dated by Israel Finkelstein to the twelfth to tenth centuries BCE.Finkelstein (2010), p. 111. Carol Redmount, on the other hand, claims that the oldest remains at the site date to the tenth century. Tell el-Qudeirat is one of scores of permanent settlements which existed in Iron Age II in the Negev Highlands.  Archaeological surveys and interpretation  The first archaeologists to notice the tell were T. E. Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") and C. L. Woolley in 1914.Cohen (1979), p. 61Woolley and Lawrence (1914). They described is as \\"little mound about 200 feet long and 120 feet broad ... in a heap from twelve to fifteen feet high above the corn-fields.\\"Woolley and Lawrence (1914), p. 64. They considered their initial work insufficient to accurately date the remains, but suggested a date somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 BCE for it and the nearby fortresses at Qasr er-Ruheibeh and Bir Birein.Woolley and Lawrence (1914), p. 67Cohen (1979), p. 61. They proposed that Tell el-Qudeirat was the biblical Kadesh-Barnea.Dothan (1965), p. 134.Woolley and Lawrence (1914), p. 71 Further work on a limited scale (\\"soundings\\") was carried out at the tell by Moshe Dothan in 1956.Ussishkin (1995), p. 118, Nelson Glueck (published in 1959), and Yohanan Aharoni (1967) discovered that a large number of other fortresses from the Iron Age also existed in the area, and proposed that these fortresses were built by Israelite kings to increase their influence over this area toward the southern edge of their dominions.Cohen (1979), p. 61). Dothan concluded that the fortress itself existed in the eighth to sixth centuries, with evidence of human settlement at the site both before and after the existence of the fortress.Ussishkin (1995), p. 118. Rudolph Cohen conducted work on a much larger scale in 1976-1982.Ussishkin (1995), p. 118. Cohen concluded that the site in fact contained remains of three fortresses. The first was built in the tenth century, in an oval shape. The second and third were rectangular. The second was built in the 8th century BCE and destroyed in the 7th century BCE. The third seemed to have been built in the second half of the 6th century BCE, during the reign of king Josiah, and was destroyed in 586 BCE when the Babylonians destroyed the Kingdom of Judah.Ussishkin (1995), p. 119. Despite the destruction of this last fortress, people continued to occupy the site for approximately two centuries.Ussishkin (1995), p. 119. Mordechai Haiman (1994) argued that these settlements were installed by the Israelite United Monarchy between about 1000 and 925 BCE.Haiman (1994), pp. 59, 61. Haiman held that these sites were abandoned after the kingdom of Israel split and Egypt invaded it around 925 BC. Of these sites, Haiman maintains that only Tell el-Qudeirat and two others were again settled in the eighth century, with Tell el-Qudeirat serving as an outpost of the kingdom of Judah. David Ussishkin (1995), on the other hand, argued that Cohen's \\"second\\" and \\"third\\" fortresses in fact constituted a single fort. While Cohen interpreted the fort as an outpost of the kingdom of Judah, Ussishkin suggested, following Nadav Na'aman, that it was not a project of the Judahite government but was perhaps constructed by Assyrians, later falling into Egyptian hands.Ussishkin (1995), p. 126. Israel Finkelstein has extended the lines of thinking found in Cohen and Ussishkin, while modifying some of their conclusions. What Cohen saw as an \\"oval fortress\\", Finkelstein sees as simply the remains of settlement between the tenth and eighth centuries, prior to any fortress construction.Finkelstein (2010), p. 111. As for the rectangular remains, Finkelstein holds these to have been a single fortress operating from the mid-eighth century to about 600.Finkelstein (2010), p. 111. Later human occupation at the site likely continued into the fourth century.Finkelstein (2010), p. 122. References Bibliography * Cohen, Rudolph.

It is often categorized by its practitioners, known as auditors, as activism and citizen journalism that tests constitutional rights; in particular the right to photograph and video record in a public space. Auditors believe that the movement promotes transparency and open government. However, critics argue that audits are often confrontational in nature, as auditors often refuse to self-identify or explain their activities. Some auditors have also been known to enter public buildings asserting that they have a legal right to openly carry, leading to accusations that auditors are engaged in intimidation, terrorism, and the sovereign citizen movement. Auditors tend to film or photograph government buildings, equipment, access control points and sensitive areas, as well as recording law enforcement or military personnel present. Auditors have been detained, arrested, assaulted, had camera equipment confiscated, weapons aimed at them, had their homes raided by a SWAT team, and been shot for video recording in a public place. Such events have prompted police officials to release information on the proper methods of handling such an activity. For example, a document sponsored by the International Association of Chiefs of Police states that the use of a recording device alone is not grounds for arrest, unless other laws are violated. The practice is predominantly an American concept, but it has also been seen in other countries including the United Kingdom and India. Behavior Auditors typically travel to a place that is considered public property, such as a sidewalk or public easement, or a place open to the public, such as a post office or government building, and visibly and openly photograph and record buildings and persons in their view. In the case of sidewalk or easement audits, the conflict arises when a property owner or manager states, in substance, that photography of their property is not allowed. Sometimes, auditors will tell property owners upon questioning that they are photographing or recording for a story, they are photographing or recording for their \\"personal use\\", or sometimes auditors do not answer questions. Frequently, local law enforcement is called and the auditor is sometimes reported as a suspicious person. Some officers will approach the auditors and request his or her identification and an explanation of their conduct. Almost universally, auditors will refuse to identify themselves and occasionally quote the relevant law to the officer as the basis for their refusal to self-identify. This sometimes results in officers arresting auditors for failing to identify themselves, obstruction of justice, disorderly conduct, or any potential or perceived crime that could potentially be justified by the occasion. Legality The act of recording in public was first clearly established in the United States following the case of Glik v. Cunniffe, which confirmed that restricting a person's right to film in public would violate their First and Fourth amendment rights. As the 7th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals explained in ACLU v. Alvarez, \\"[t]he act of making an audio or audiovisual recording is necessarily included within the First Amendment’s guarantee of speech and press rights as a corollary of the right to disseminate the resulting recording. The right to publish or broadcast an audio or audiovisual recording would be insecure, or largely ineffective, if the antecedent act of making the recording is wholly unprotected.\\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate- courts/ca7/11-1286/11-1286-2012-05-08.pdf?ts=1411041480 However, the legality of the auditors' actions beyond mere filming are frequently subject to debate. As long as the auditor remains in a public place where they are legally allowed to be, they have the right to record anything in plain view, subject to very limited time, place, and manner restrictions. Some auditors occasionally yell insults, derogatory language, and vulgarities at police officers who attempt to stop them from recording or improperly demand identification. Police will sometimes charge auditors with disorderly conduct when they engage in behavior that could be considered unlawful, for example, an auditor in San Antonio was prosecuted and convicted of disorderly conduct after an audit. After the trial, the Chief of Police for the City of San Antonio stated \\"[the verdict] puts a dagger in the heart of their First Amendment excuse for insulting police officers...\\" The auditor intends to appeal the decision. Despite the San Antonio Police Chief's statement, insulting the police is consistently treated as constitutionally protected speech. In State of Washington v. Marc D. Montgomery, a 15-year-old successfully won an appeal overturning his convictions for disorderly conduct and possession of marijuana on the grounds of free speech. Montgomery was arrested after shouting obscenities, such as \\"fucking pigs, fucking pig ass hole\\" at two police officers passing in their patrol car. Citing Cohen v. California, the Court ruled that Montgomery's words could not be classified as fighting words, and restricting speech based merely on its offensiveness would result in a \\"substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process.\\" The rights exercised in a typical audit are Freedom of Speech in the First Amendment, Freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures in the Fourth Amendment, and the Right to Remain Silent in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Auditors attempt to exercise their First Amendment right to photograph and record in public while avoiding committing any crime. The reason for this stems from the Supreme Court's decision in Terry v. Ohio which held that it was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment to detain someone when the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. Further, following the Supreme Court's decision in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, the Court held that in States that have stop and identify statutes, a person may be required to provide their name to an officer who has reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. The conflict with law enforcement officers generally arises because officers sometimes deem photography, in and of itself, \\"suspicious behavior\\" and use that as a reason to detain an Auditor and demand identification. Universally, Courts that have reviewed this specific issue have held that the fact that a person takes a photograph or makes an audio or video recording in a public place or in a place he or she has the right to be, does not constitute, in and of itself, a reasonable suspicion to detain the person, probable cause to arrest the person, or a sufficient justification to demand identification. Some states have even revised their penal code to reflect that issue. Nonetheless, officers frequently illegally detain or arrest auditors for \\"suspicious behavior.\\" One of the main problems that auditors face in subsequent lawsuits are the Supreme Court's decisions in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, and Anderson v. Creighton, which held that government officials, including officers, would be shielded from liability and damages as long as their conduct does not violate \\"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\\". Therefore, while a Fourth Amendment seizure claim might exist for an auditor who stood on a public sidewalk and took pictures of a police station only to be handcuffed and placed in the back of a patrol car, a First Amendment claim would be dismissed because although a violation occurred, it was not \\"clearly established.\\" Qualified immunity allows \\"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law\\" to escape liability for egregious and obvious violations of civil rights. So far the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th Circuits have held that recording the police in the course of their official duties is a clearly established right.  Controversy  = Intimidation = Auditing is controversial in nature due to the confrontational tactics of auditors, which some may see as intimidation or harassment. In addition, many public employees are not familiar with handling people walking around silently recording their interactions. While the conduct is generally legal, such activity may cause alarm. Some auditors cite independent research into relevant laws, pointing out that they are currently being recorded by cameras in the building, or by stating that there is no expectation of privacy in public. = Profanity = Audits are even more confrontational when auditors engage in verbal disputes with government employees. Some auditors may use profane language during the audit. Some may confuse obscenity for profanity, and while the latter is generally protected by the first amendment, the right to engage in a verbal dispute depends highly on the circumstances. While on public streets, parks, or sidewalks, the right to free speech is at its highest, as one is within a traditional public forum. However, in limited public forums, such as public buildings, meeting rooms, and other public lobbies, the right to free speech may be more limited.  Goal  One auditor stated goal of an audit is to \\"put yourself in places where you know chances are the cops are going to be called. Are they going to uphold the constitution, uphold the law . . . or break the law?\\" Auditors state that they seek to educate the public that photography is not a crime, while publicizing cases where officers illegally stop what is perceived as illegal conduct. An auditor selects a public facility and then films the entire encounter with staff and customers alike. If no confrontation or attempt to stop the filming occurs, then the facility passes the audit; if an employee attempts to stop a filming event, it fails the audit. Some auditors are concerned that if officers are willing to harass, detain, and arrest auditors, who intentionally avoid doing anything that might be considered a crime, normal citizens might shy away from recording officers for fear of retaliation. Justice Jacques Wiener of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit wrote in a 2017 federal appeals decision in favor of an auditor detained for filming police officers, “Filming the police contributes to the public’s ability to hold the police accountable, ensure that police officers are not abusing their power, and make informed decisions about police policy.”  References  Freedom of expression in the United States First Amendment to the United States Constitution ","title":"First Amendment audits"},{"id":"58422101","text":"Samantha Bremner (born 19 December 1991) is an Australian rugby league footballer who captains the St George Illawarra Dragons in the NRL Women's Premiership.

The Northwestern Shipbuilding Company constructed her at Bellingham, Washington, and delivered her to the United States Army in June 1944 for use during World War II. The U.S. Army placed her in service as the \\"freight and supply\\" ship U.S. Army Lt. Raymond Zussman (FS-246) and retained the ship for use after the war. Fish and Wildlife Service On 21 April 1910, the United States Congress assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands to the United States Bureau of Fisheries.AFSC Historical Corner: The Pribilof Islands Tender Vessels Retrieved September 4, 2018 The United States Department of the Interior′s Fish and Wildlife Service – renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) after a 1956 reorganization – assumed these responsibilities when it replaced the Bureau of Fisheries in 1940. Since 1917, the Bureau of Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife Service had operated a \\"Pribilof tender\\" – a dedicated supply vessel used to transport passengers and cargo to and from the Pribilof Islands On the night of 3 June 1950, the FWS Pribilof tender MV Penguin caught fire while moored at the FWS dock in Lake Union in Seattle.AFSC Historical Corner: Penguin, Pribilof Tender for 20 Years (1930-50) Retrieved September 6, 2018 Before firefighters could extinguish the blaze, it destroyed her superstructure and cabins. Although her hull remained intact, the FWS determined that the cost of repairing the damage – originally estimated at US$15,000 to US$20,000, but later at US$75,000 – was more than the cost of replacing her. Before the fire, Penguin had been scheduled to depart Seattle for the Pribilofs with much-needed provisions on 13 June 1950, so the matter of replacing her was one of urgency. On 9 June 1950, the FWS purchased Lt. Raymond Zussman from the U.S. Army. The ship was faster and larger (540 gross tons than Penguin (394 gross tons), and, as 'MV Lt. Raymond Zussman, she departed Seattle for her first voyage to the Pribilofs on 17 June 1950, only four days later than Penguin′s scheduled departure. During the summer of 1950, United States Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman announced that Lt. Raymond Zussman would undergo a name change, saying, \\"The goodwill built up for 20 years in the name of the Penguin will not be lost...the vessel's successor has been named Penguin II.\\" Accordingly, the FWS formally renamed the ship MV Penguin II on 21 September 1950. Penguin II made three round-trips between Seattle and the Pribilof Islands in 1950. A baidara, or \\"bidarrah,\\" better known today as an Umiak, is towed out to Penguin II to unload her while she rides at anchor in the Bering Sea off the Pribilof Islands in 1961. The lack of docking facilities for Penguin II in the Pribilofs necessitated this time-consuming method of lighterage there at the time. Penguin II underwent renovations in February 1951 which gave her more cabin area, doubled her cargo capacity, and gave her ten times the refrigerated storage space of her predecessor Penguin; later, she also received an electromechanical steering system. She made five round trips between Seattle and the Pribilofs in 1952, during which she logged . She made six trips in 1953, logging and carrying 612 passengers, 3,450 tons of general cargo, and 146,484 U.S. gallons (117,187 Imperial gallons; 554,502 liters) of fuel oil. She transported many of the 66,378 sealskins harvested in 1953 at the Pribilofs to Seattle. In addition to making voyages between Seattle and the Pribilofs, Penguin II also made trips within the Pribilofs between Saint Paul Island and St. George Island to provide inter-island transportation for local passengers and cargo. She also delivered provisions to small Aleut communities on the Alaska Peninsula and in the Aleutian Islands. Each autumn, she delivered Christmas trees during her voyages. In 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service was renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as part of a reorganization that year that created the USFWS′s new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF), which thereafter maintained and operated Penguin II. By the early 1960s, the demand for supplies in the Pribilof Islands had increased to the point that the BCF considered Penguin II too small to serve as its Pribilof tender. In October 1962, the U.S. Army loaned the refrigerated cargo ship FSR-791 to the BCF, which placed her in service as the new Pribilof tender MV Pribilof in 1963.AFSC Historical Corner: Pribilof, Bureau's Last Pribilof Tender (1964-75) Retrieved September 4, 2018 Consequently, the BCF decommissioned Penguin II in 1963 and sold her at auction in Seattle on 18 August 1964. Later career Penguin II was sold into commercial service. She was sighted in the Port of Los Angeles at Los Angeles, California, in 1976, operating under the Colombian flag with the name Aurora and with her home port at San Andrés in Colombia.

The administrative centre was the village of Andenes where the Andenes Church is located. History The municipality of Andenes was established on 1 January 1924 when Dverberg Municipality was divided into three: Andenes (population: 2,213) in the north, Bjørnskinn (population: 1,410) in the south, and Dverberg (population: 1,477) in the central part of the old municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Andenes (population: 3,812) was merged (back) with the municipalities of Dverberg (population: 1,719) and Bjørnskinn (population: 1,835) to create the new Andøy Municipality.

Ilaiyaraaja composed the soundtrack of the film, with cinematography by Tanvir Mir and editing by N. Arunkumar. Production began in September 2018, and the film released worldwide on 24 January 2020. Plot The movie opens with the psycho beheading a woman. Gautham (Udhayanidhi Stalin), a blind musician, is in love with a radio jockey named Dagini (Aditi Rao Hydari). After multiple attempts by Gautham, Dagini asks him to meet her at a place that she will be talking about in her radio session. Gautham listens to the radio all day and manages to find the place, which is a train station. Dagini, hopefully waiting for him, sees the psycho-killer all of a sudden. She feels afraid and tries to escape, but the psycho manages to sedate her. Gautham reaches the place in time but fails to save her due to his blindness. However, using his sense of smell, he realizes that something is wrong. The psycho later spares Gautham's life and takes Dagini to his secret lair. The next day, the police goes to Gautham and extracts information from him. A total of 14 girls were abducted, 13 of whom got murdered, and the recently kidnapped Dagini. Gautham soon realizes that the police cannot find anything, and he decides to seek out and save Dagini on his own terms. The psycho is about to behead Dagini, but he notices that there is no sense of fear in her. He asks her for the reason, to which she replies that Gautham will find her within a week regardless of her death and that the psycho will be answering for his crimes soon. The psycho leaves her chained to a wall and accepts that as a challenge. Gautham uses various methods to find the killer with the help of Kamala (Nithya Menen), a handicapped ex-police officer who was previously dealing with the case. Together, they both deduce that the psycho must be a rich man who owns pig farms using the smell from the decayed bodies of the murdered girls. Realizing that Gautham is getting closer to him, the psycho goes on a killing spree. Gautham, Kamala and their associates all visit and enquire the owners of pig farms in the area, but they have failed in their attempts. Depressed, Gautham goes to his house and stays there alone. The psycho visits him, and Gautham acknowledges his presence. However, Gautham's friend Rajanayakam (Singampuli) defends him and tries to chase down the psycho in his car. Unfortunately, the psycho hides himself in a dense area of tall grass and finally manages to kill Rajanayakam. The next day, Gautham mourns over the death of his friend and plans to drop his plan due to a large number of people's deaths. Later, Kamala reveals that she had prior notice that the killer had gone to a college function. With regained hope, they all go back to the college and look at the recordings during that day. They manage to find someone suspicious, but his face got blurred. However, they notice a college staff sitting beside him. Using relevant information from him, they manage to find the killer. In the meantime, Dagini manages to go around the psycho's lair and sees a jailed woman and a dead police corpse. She reveals to her that the psycho was her former student at an borstal and the psycho used to masturbate, so she used to beat him 60 times every day, for all 365 days in a year for his mistake. Around 11:45 PM, Gautham reaches the psycho's lair. The psycho is about to behead Dagini, the intruder alarms gets activated. The enraged psycho runs to kill Gautham, but eventually, Gautham manages to cuff the psycho's leg. Gautham later runs and rescues Dagini. They both manage to run away. However, the psycho begs out, \\"Teacher, please don't leave me alone here\\". Dagini, who sees the light in him, places the keys to the cuff a few metres in front of him. Later, they both escape together with Kamala. The psycho is about to take the key, but the imprisoned teacher takes the key and swallows it, trying to punish him. The psycho gets infuriated and tears her stomach to get the key. He later releases himself and runs to find them both. Fortunately, they both leave, and he screams as he failed. Later on, it is evident that Dagini has been affected by Stockholm Syndrome, as she sympathizes with the psychopath when questioned by the press and refuses to consider him a killer but understands his innocent heart filled with pain and if it was his mother or sister, she would have cared for him so that he would not have become the killer that he was. The psycho sees the interview and realizes his mistakes after finally feeling loved by someone. The movie ends of with the psycho falling off a cliff with a smile on his face with the song Thai Madiyil (Mother's Lap). According to Mysskin, the film is inspired from a Buddhist tale on Aṅgulimāla, an important figure in the religion.

The character is voiced by Spencer Fox in the first film and Huckleberry Milner in the second film. Restless, relentless and curious, Dash sports a hearty sense of adventure and a boundless supply of energy. Born with the remarkable power of super speed, he would love nothing more than to show off his special skills and fight a few bad guys along the way, and doesn't understand why he has to keep his powers a secret. Dash has been recognized as one of Pixar's greatest characters by many prominent media publications.  Development  When designing the Incredibles family, Brad Bird wanted each of their superpowers to be related to their personality. He stated that ten-year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls thus conceived Dash as \\"the average ten-year-old boy that can move twice as fast as anybody else\\". The filmmakers cast rising eleven-year-old Spencer Fox who made his feature film debut in The Incredibles to voice the diminutive and mischievous son of Bob and Helen Parr. Brad Bird wanted to give Dash a realistic out-of-breath voice in certain scenes such as the jungle scene so he made Fox run four laps around the Pixar studio until he got tired. Due to Fox's voice maturing he was replaced by 10-year-old newcomer Huckleberry Milner in the sequel. Producer John Walker said of Dash in the sequel, \\"Dash got a taste of life as a crime fighter in the first film. Returning to regular life doesn't really interest him—he loved fighting crime with his family and, even better, showing off just how fast he can be.\\"  Powers and abilities  Dash possesses the superhuman capacity to move at great speeds and his power is sufficient enough to allow him to be able to run over water without submerging. This speed also appears to extend to his other individual limbs as he is able to punch at a rapid rate. Dash's increased speed also augments his practical reaction time, making his reflexes much faster than those of an ordinary human. Edna Mode designed his super suit to be resistant to air friction, wear, and heat when Dash is running at super speed.  Personality  Dash, as described by Helen, is a \\"highly competitive boy, and a bit of a showoff\\". He has a reckless and impulsive nature. Dash believes that he shouldn't be ashamed of his abilities or need to hide them, believing it makes him special. Although he bickers with his sister Violet, he shows a strong caring side when he comes to her defense against one of Syndrome's minions in the first installment.  Appearances  In the 2004 film The Incredibles, Dash complains that his mother, Helen, will not allow him to play school sports, because she thinks that he would use his super-speed and blow the family's civilian cover. She is also upset when he uses his power to play a prank on his teacher, Bernie Kropp, which can also threaten their cover. As Helen prepares to go after Dash's father, Bob, who she discovers is on a Syndrome's island, Dash and his sister, Violet, discovers the supersuits Edna Mode made for them. Donning the one made for him, Dash calls himself The Dash. He and Violet stow away on Helen's plane, and the three of them barely survive its destruction by Syndrome, Dash and Violet are left to fend for themselves in the island's jungles as Helen goes after a captured Bob. Before leaving them in a cave, Helen tells Dash that if they encounter danger, he should run as fast as he can to protect himself, the first time Dash is allowed to do so. The cave turns out to be the fiery exhaust for the flames of Syndrome's base, Dash and Violet are forced to flee the cave, and defend themselves when they are confronted by Syndrome's henchmen. This proves to be the first time Dash is able to fully explore the extent and application of his powers, which allow him to evade his pursuers, best them in fistfights, quickly generate cover by kicking up dirt, and even run on water. He and Violet also discover that when they combine his speed with her force field powers, they can create a spherical force field that can traverse water. Nonetheless, Syndrome captures all four family members. After Violet frees them, they travel back to Metro City, Dash and his family, along with Frozone, work together to defeat Syndrome's Omnidroid. A few months later, Dash's parents allow him to participate in the track & field practice, but urge him to pull back on first place, as a way to avoid using his powers too conspicuously. When the villainous Underminer emerges from beneath the ground, Dash joins his family in donning his mask in preparation to confront the criminal. In the 2018 sequel Incredibles 2, as Helen pursues the Screenslaver as part of a publicity campaign to rehabilitate the image of superheroes in the mind of the public, Bob spends more time with Dash and Violet. Bob struggles to help Dash with his math homework, in light of his lack of familiarity with how the children of Dash's generation are taught math. For his part, Dash entertains dreams of firing the rockets of his father's high-tech car, the Incredimobile. When his family is confronted at their home by a group of superheroes being mind-controlled by Evelyn Deavor, Frozone is captured, and Dash, Violet and their infant brother Jack-Jack escape in the Incredimobile. They travel to Everjust, the yacht of Evelyn's brother, Winston, where they free the superheroes, including their parents and Frozone, from Evelyn's mind control, leading to Evelyn's defeat and arrest. At the end of the film, after Dash accompanies his family in dropping off Violet and her date, Tony Rydinger, at a movie theater, the family sees a high-speed chase in progress, and once again goes into action.  Critical reception  Hypable ranked Dash the sixth-best Incredibles 2 superhero, with author Aaron Locke writing \\"Still young and learning important virtues like patience and restraint, Dash is full of potential that could make him a powerful superhero\\". Ana Luisa Suarez of Hollywood.com considers Dash celebrating victory as one of \\"15 Reasons Why 'The Incredibles' Is The Best Superhero Movie\\" Jonathon Dornbush of IGN identified \\"Dash's desire to be his full self in a society that may not want him to\\" among the reasons he believes The Incredibles remains one of Pixar's best. The Washington Posts Jennifer Frey described Dash as \\"the classic rambunctious little boy, driven nuts by the fact that his superhuman speed prevents him from being able to join any sports teams\\". Joshua Tyler of CinemaBlend said \\"He's completely in love with his superpowers, the way any kid would be if he knew he could run at the speed of sound. He's crazy for adventure, drunk with the idea of being a hero and for him The Incredibles is one fantastic game where he's finally allowed to run as fast as he can\\". Some critics complained that the character was underused in the sequel, and relegated to being only a comic device. CNET contributor Mike Sorrentino wrote that the film's emphasis on Helen and Bob results in Dash being \\"relegated to the sidelines for most of the film\\". Molly Freeman observed that the character's arc \\"largely exist[s] to serve Bob's own storyline\\" and stated that \\"Dash receives less screen time, and even less development as a result, with him providing little more than comedic relief\\". Germain Lussier of io9 said \\"Dash takes a bit of a back seat this time around\\". Critics praised Huck Milner for his performance of Dash in the sequel. Writing for Vulture.com, Edelstein praised Milner's performance for Dash \\"Huck Milner does justice to his first name—he could be Huck Finn or Tom Sawyer or any drivingly inquisitive kid hero\\". The New Yorkers Anthony Lane also praise Milner saying \\"the high-speed Dash, has been updated; his lines are now spoken, I rejoice to say, by a young actor named Huckleberry Milner. It's ideal for Dash, whose permanent aim is to race around the river bend, as it were, and see what adventures await\\". In May 2017 Dash was recently ranked the 6th most powerful super in the Incredibles films by Shawn S. Lealos at Screen Rant.

The west part is the ancient and huge impact basin—Isidis, about 1500 km in diameter. Northeast Syrtis is a region of Mars once considered by NASA as a landing site for the Mars 2020 rover mission. This landing site failed in the competition with Jezero crater, another landing site dozens of kilometers away from Northeast Syrtis. It is located in the northern hemisphere of Mars at coordinates 18°N,77°E in the northeastern part of the Syrtis Major volcanic province, within the ring structure of Isidis impact basin as well. This region contains diverse morphological features and minerals, indicating that water once flowed here. It may be an ancient habitable environment; microbes could have developed and thrived here. The layered terrain of Northeast Syrtis is unique on the surface of Mars, containing diverse aqueous minerals such as like clay, carbonate, serpentine and sulfate, as well as igneous minerals such as olivine and high-calcium and low-calcium pyroxene. Clay minerals form in the interaction between water and rock and sulfate minerals usually form through intense evaporation on Earth. Similar processes may happen on Mars forming these minerals, which strongly suggests a history of water and rock interaction. In addition, megabreccia, possibly the oldest material throughout this region (some blocks are over 100 m in diameter), could give an insight into the primary crust when Mars first formed. The location is an ideal site for studying the timing and evolution of the surface processes of Mars, such as huge impact basin formation, fluvial activity (valley networks, small outflow channels), groundwater activity, history of glaciation, and volcanic activity. Regional stratigraphy  The stratigraphic column of Northeast Syrtis. The thickness of each unit is hard to estimate. after The regional stratigraphy of Northeast Syrtis has been studied in detail. This area is sandwiched between a huge shield volcano—Syrtis Major—and one of largest impact basins in the solar system, and therefore could provide a key constraint of the timing of key events in the history of Mars. The stratigraphy can be divided into four major units, from young to old: #Syrtis Major lavas unit contains high-calcium pyroxene bearing material; #Layered sulfate-bearing unit, include poly-hydrated sulfates and jarosite; #Olivine unit, olivine-enriched unit variably altered to carbonate and serpentine; #Basement unit: The mixture of iron/magnesium (Fe/Mg) smectite and low-calcium pyroxene-bearing unit variably altered to Aluminium-clay bearing materials. The basement unit is one of newest units on Mars, recording early-stage evolution history of terrestrial planets. The change from carbonate to sulfate indicates a transition from alkaline-neutral to acid aqueous environments.  Mars 2020 mission  The Mars 2020 rover launched in July 2020 with Atlas V rocket to reach Mars in February 2021. This rover inherits from the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity, with similar entry, descent, and landing systems, and the sky crane. Besides exploring a likely habitable site and searching for signs of past life, collecting scientifically compelling samples (rock and regolith) which could address fundamental scientific questions if returned to Earth, is the main goal of the Mars 2020 mission. The landing site's selection is the key part of this mission's success. Although Northeast Syrtis survived the cut in third Mars 2020 Landing Site Workshops, it failed final completion. The landing ellipse of Northeast Syrtis is 16 x 14 km and the smaller ellipse is 13.3 × 7.8 km with the help of advanced technologyTerrain-Relative Navigation (TRN). Landing ellipse of NE Syrtis, Mars. The blue oval is Northeast Syrtis landing ellipse. The white oval is the smaller anding ellipse with Terrain-Relative Navigation technique. The yellow oval is another potential landing site, Jezero landing ellipse. The context image is CTX (Context Camera) onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. = Region of interest = Mesa unit in Northeast Syrtis, Mars.  Mesa unit  Megabreccia in Northeast Syrtis. The mesa is one of the interesting locations. It consists of five subunits: crater-retaining cap, boulder-shedding slopes exposing lightened blocks, olivine-carbonate unit, Fe/Mg-phyllosilicate, allowing easy to access diverse rocks. On the top of the mesa is a dark toned cap unit, composed of meter-scale boulders. It was interpreted as Hesperian Syrtis Major lava flows or lithified ash. These igneous rocks are suitable samples for acquiring the age of Martian geologic events, which could calibrate the planet dating method. Unlike Earth, planet dating mainly relies on crater counting, a method based on the assumption that the number of impact craters on a planet surface increases with the length of time that the surface has been exposed to space cratering, calibrated using the ages obtained by radiometric dating of samples of Luna and Apollo missions. The samples of this mission returned to Earth will be analyzed by state of the art equipment in laboratories. Igneous samples from Northeast Syrtis could provide four key time for Martian geology history, including (1) the timing of Isidis impact event, (2) the timing of emplacement of olivine-rich unit, (3) the timing of dark-toned mafic cap rock, (4) the timing of Syrtis lava flows, which would fundamentally improve human knowledge of early Mars and the early history of solar system, such as the late-heavy bombardment. This region exposes the largest high-olivine abundance rocks on Mars. The origin of high-olivine rock is still in debate. Impact cumulates or olivine-rich lava are two leading hypotheses. A portion of olivine rock was altered to carbonate. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of carbonate, including a serpentine springs system. Carbonate is important sink of carbon, and is a crucial part of understanding the carbon cycle of Mars. Future sample return could shed light on the environmental conditions of carbonate. As well, the isotopic composition of carbonate through time, records the atmosphere loss, and it also reveals whether life once emerged on Mars. The lower part of mesa unit is the basement unit of the Northeast Syrtis region, consisting of Fe/Mg smectites and low calcium pyroxene. The basement unit was partially altered to form kaolinite. The kaolinite (Al-clay) usually overlying the Fe/Mg smectites across the Martian surface. Weathering in a warm climate or acid leaching are two domain interpretations of kaolinite formation. = Megabreccia = Layer sulfate unit in Northeast Syrtis. Megabreccia occurs throughout the basement unit of Northeast Syrtis. The composition of these megabreccias is complex, including altered or mafic material. These megabreccias may be uplifted and exposed by the Isidis Basin forming event. The megabreccia could reveal the nature of the remnant of Mars's primary crust or the Noachian-aged low-calcium pyroxene lavas. It also could constrain the timing of Martian dynamo activity.  Layer sulfate unit  Further to the south of the landing ellipse, there is a thick sequence of sulfate deposits capped by lava flows from the later Syrtis Major volcanic formation. The layer of sulfates include poly-hydrated sulphates and jarosite. Jarosite usually indicate oxidizing and acid (pH<4) environments. The occurrence of jarosite indicates that the environment changed from neutral/alkaline (as suggested by extensive Fe/Mg smectites and carbonate) to acid. The detection of sulfate adds more complexity to Martian geologic history.

The white TTG rock body is intruded by dark mafic dikes, as well as light color felsic dikes. The mafic minerals in the TTG rock body, possibly biotite, were weathered, which introduced a brownish coating on the TTG rock surface. Tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite rocks or TTG rocks are intrusive rocks with typical granitic composition (quartz and feldspar) but containing only a small portion of potassium feldspar. Tonalite, trondhjemite, and granodiorite often occur together in geological records, indicating similar petrogenetic processes. Post Archean (after 2.5 Ga) TTG rocks are present in arc-related batholiths, as well as in ophiolites (although of a small proportion), while Archean TTG rocks are major components of Archean cratons. Composition The quartz percentage among felsic minerals in TTG rocks is usually larger than 20% but less than 60%. In tonalite and trondhjemite, more than 90% of the feldspars are plagioclase, while in granodiorite, this number is between 65% and 90%. Trondhjemite is a special kind of tonalite, with most of the plagioclase in the rock being oligoclase. The major accessory minerals of TTG rocks include biotite, amphiboles (e.g. hornblende), epidote, and zircon. Geochemically, TTG rocks often have a high silica (SiO2) content (commonly over 70 percent SiO2), high Na2O content (with low K2O/Na2O ratio) compared to other plutonic rocks, and low ferromagnesian element content (the weight percentage of Fe2O3, MgO, MnO2, TiO2 added together commonly smaller than 5%).  Post Archean TTG Rocks  Post Archean TTG rocks are commonly found in arc settings, especially in continental arcs. Ophiolite also contains a small amount of TTG rocks. = Continental arc TTG rocks = Continental arc TTG rocks are often associated with gabbro, diorite, and granite, which forms a plutonic sequence in batholiths. They are formed by hundred of plutons that directly related to subduction. For example, Coastal Batholith of Peru consists of 7 ~ 16% gabbro and diorite, 48 ~ 60% tonalite (including trondhjemite), and 20 ~ 30% granodiorite, with 1 ~ 4% granite. These TTG rocks in continental arc batholiths may partially originate from the magma differentiation (i.e. fractional crystallisation) of the subduction induced mantle wedge melt at depth. However, the large volume of such TTG rocks infer their major generation mechanism is by the crustal thickening induced partial melting of the former gabbroic underplate at the base of the continental crust. Tonalitic composition rock crystallised first before the magma differentiated to granodioritic and later granitic composition at a shallow depth. Some island arc plutonic roots also have TTG rocks, e.g. Tobago, but they are rarely exposed. = TTG rocks in ophiolite = Tonalites (including trondhjemites) can be found above the layered gabbro section in ophiolites, below or within sheeted dykes. They are often irregular in shape and produced by magma differentiation.  Archean TTG rocks  TTG rock sample (Tsawela gneiss) with foliation from the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa. The white minerals are plagioclase; the light grey ones are quartz; the dark, greenish ones are biotite and hornblende, which developed foliation.Archean TTG rocks appear to be strongly deformed grey gneiss, showing banding, lineation, and other metamorphic structures, whose protoliths were intrusive rocks. TTG rock is one of the major rock types in Archean cratons. = Geochemical features = In terms of trace element characteristics, Archean TTGs exhibit high light rare earth element (LREE) content yet low heavy rare earth element (HREE) content. However, they do not show Eu and Sr anomalies. These features indicate the presence of garnet and amphibole, but no plagioclase in the residual phase during partial melting or precipitation phase during fractional crystallization. = Petrogenesis and classification = Confirmed by geochemical modelling, TTG type magma can be generated through partial melting of hydrated meta-mafic rocks. To produce the very low HREE pattern, the melting should be conducted under a garnet-stable pressure-temperature field. Given that garnet temperature stability rises dramatically with increasing pressure, strongly HREE-depleted TTG melts are expected to form under relatively high pressure. Besides the source composition and the pressure, the degree of melting and temperature also influence the melt composition. Detailed studies classified Archean TTGs into three groups based on geochemical features, that are low, medium, and high pressure TTGs, although the three groups form a continuous evolution. The low pressure subseries shows relatively low Al2O3, Na2O, Sr content and relatively high Y, Yb, Ta, and Nb content, corresponding to melting under 10-12 kbar with the source rock mineral assembly of plagioclase, pyroxene and possibly amphibole or garnet. The high pressure group shows the opposite geochemical features, corresponding to melting at a pressure over 20 kbar, with the source rock containing garnet and rutile but no amphibolite or plagioclase. The medium pressure group has transitional features between the other two groups, corresponding to melting under a pressure around 15 kbar with the source rock containing amphibole, much garnet, but little rutile and no plagioclase. Medium pressure TTGs are the most abundant among the three groups. = Geodynamic settings = The geodynamic setting of the Archean TTG rock generation is currently not well understood. Competing hypotheses include subduction related generation involving plate tectonics and other non-plate tectonic models.  Plate tectonic setting  Hypothesized Archean hot subduction induced Archean TTG generation model. The heavier oceanic crust sinks into the lighter mantle. The subducting slab is young and hot, thus when it is heated, it partially melts to generate TTG magmas, which rise and intrude into the continental crust. Light green: continental crust; dark green: oceanic crust; red: TTG melts; orange: mantle. Modified from Moyen & Martin, 2012. Geochemical similarity shared between TTGs and adakites was long noted by researchers. Adakites are one type of modern arc lavas, which differ from common arc lavas (mostly granitoids) in their felsic and sodic nature with high LREE but low HREE content. Their production is interpreted to be the partial melting of young and hot subducting oceanic slabs with minor interaction with surrounding mantle wedges, rather than mantle wedge melts like other arc-granitoids. Based on geochemical features (e.g. Mg, Ni, and Cr contents), adakites can be further divided into two groups, namely high SiO2 adakites (HSA) and low SiO2 adakites (LSA). It was then noted that the Archean TTGs were geochemically almost identical to high silica adakites (HSA), but slightly different from low silica adakites (LSA). This geochemical similarity let some researchers infer that the geodynamic setting of Archean TTGs was analogous to that of modern adakites. They think that Archean TTGs were generated by hot subduction as well. Although modern adakites are rare and only found in a few localities (e.g. Adak Island in Alaska and Mindanao in the Philippines), they argue that due to a higher mantle potential temperature of the Earth, a hotter and softer crust may have enabled intense adakite-type subduction during Archean time. TTGs packages were then generated in such settings, with large scale proto- continents formed by collisions at a later stage. However, other authors doubt the existence of Archean subduction by pointing out the absence of major plate tectonic indicators during most of the Archean Eon.Condie, K. C., & Kröner, A. (2008). When did plate tectonics begin? Evidence from the geologic record. In When did plate tectonics begin on planet Earth (Vol. 440, pp. 281-294). Geological Society of America Special Papers. It is also noted that Archean TTGs were intrusive rocks while the modern adakite is extrusive in nature, thus their magma should differ in composition, especially in water content.  Non-plate tectonic settings  delaminates into the lighter mantle. The pressure and temperature increases induce the partial melting of the delaminated mafic block to generate TTG magma, which rises and intrudes to the crust. In the lower figure, mantle plume rises to the base of the mafic crust and thicken the crust. The partial melting of the mafic crust due to the plume heating generates TTG magma intrusions. Modified from Moyen & Martin, 2012. Various evidence has shown that Archean TTG rocks were directly derived from preexisting mafic materials. The melting temperature of meta-mafic rocks (generally between 700 °C and 1000 °C) depends primarily on their water content but only a little on pressure. Different groups of TTG should therefore have experienced distinct geothermal gradients, which corresponding to different geodynamic settings. The low pressure group has formed along geotherms around 20-30 °C/km, which are comparable to those during the underplating of plateau bases. Mantle upwellings add mafic basement to the crust and the pressure due to the cumulation thickness may reach the requirement of low pressure TTG production. The partial melting of the plateau base (which can be induced by further mantle upwelling) would then lead to low pressure TTG generation. The high pressure TTGs have experienced geotherms lower than 10 °C/km, which are close to modern hot subduction geotherms experienced by young slabs (but around 3 °C/km hotter than other modern subduction zones), whilst the geotherms for the most abundant TTG subseries, medium pressure group, are between 12 and 20 °C/km. Other than hot subduction, such geotherms may also be possible during the delamination of mafic crustal base. The delamination may be attributed to mantle downwelling or an increase in density of the mafic crustal base due to metamorphism or partial melt extraction. Those delaminated meta-mafic bodies then sink down, melt, and interact with surrounding mantle to generate TTGs. Such delamination induced TTG generation process is petrogenetically similar to that of subduction, both of which involves deep burial of mafic rocks into the mantle.

He was born in Banjarmasin in about 1896, the son of a local peranakan Chinese business owner, Liem Ke An.Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), p. 43 He attended the Hollands-Chineesche School to class 6, when he was reportedly expelled after coming into conflict with a Dutch teacher. He subsequently worked as a business clerk for Royal Dutch Shell in Balikpapan before returning to Banjarmasin to work for a local newspaper. The name of the newspaper is not known, but may have been Penimbangan, Pengharepan, or Borneo Post.Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), p. 45 In 1915 he moved to Surabaya where he worked in the newspaper Tjhoen Tjhioe. In 1917 he published a monthly magazine, Soe Liem Poo, but that title survived only briefly. Liem then moved to Aceh to carry out trade. At the end of 1918, Liem move to Padang to become editor of Sinar Soematra. He held that post until 1921, when he was invited by The Kian Sing to become editor of Pewarta Soerabaia. In 1925, Liem resigned from that paper and on 1 April 1925 he founded Soeara Poeblik, which continued to publish in Surabaya until 1929. In this period he argued strongly for the right of Chinese residents of the Dutch East Indies to retain Chinese citizenship and not to be registered as Dutch colonial subjects.Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), p. 48. At about the same time that he launched Soeara Poebliek, Liem Koen Hian (and Kwee Thiam Tjing) joined the Nanyang Societie, a Chinese gambling association. In 1919 he wrote, '\\"I am a Chinese, I have a fatherland across the sea which is trying to enhance itself. In this attempt it urges help and assistance from its faithful sons, either those who are still in the country or overseas. Among its own sons overseas, it includes my people in the Indies, who, in turn, look to their fatherland to enhance their status. This is the duty of the peranakan Chinese that before we help other countries, we should help China first because we place all our hope on China. It is understandable that the improvement of our status overseas would come rather slowly but we will not lose our patience.\\"Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), p. 49. In the late 1920s, however, influenced by the ideas of Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, he began to argue for an Indies citizenship (Indische burgerschap) which would encompass Chinese Indonesians (hoakiauw) resident in what he called Lam Yang (Indonesia), as well as Native Indonesians and Eurasians. This argument was directed especially against the associated with the newspaper Sin Po, who argued that Chinese in Indonesia should align themselves with China. Criticised for his apparent change of view, he responded, \\"\\"Previously I called myself a Chinese nationalist... [now] I call myself an Indonesian nationalist. It does not mean that I have changed my political conviction [belief], I have merely changed its object. Because I live in Indonesia, I believe I can do more for Indonesia than for China. However, the content of my conviction has not changed, for the content of Chinese nationalism is identical to Indonesia nationalism.\\"Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), p. 53. Based on this vision, Liem founded the Partai Tionghoa Indonesia which supported and took part in the Indonesian nationalist movement. The founding members of the new party included Kwee Thiam Tjing, a Dutch-educated journalist, and Ong Liang Kok a young lawyer. The founding meeting was held on 25 September 1932. In line with the ideas of Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, the party argued for the equality of all races in a future independent Indonesia.Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), p. 57. The new political party contrasted with the pro-establishment Chung Hwa Hui, which advocated loyalty to the Dutch colonial state; and with the Sin Po group that called for allegiance to the pre-war Republic of China. Liem continued to work as a journalist, working as editor of Sin Tit Po (December 1929—1932). He shifted temporarily to Kong Hoa Po (April 1937—November 1938), but returned to Sin Tit Po in early 1938. In the early 1930s, Liem was active in literary and journalist circles, joining the editorial board of the newspaper Panorama, together with Amir Syarifuddin, Sanusi Pane and Mohammad Yamin. In mid-1936, together with his colleagues Amir, Pane and Yamin, Liem started another newspaper, Kebangoenan (1936–1941), which--as with Panorama--was published by Phoa Liong Gie's Siang Po Printing Press. In 1933—1935, Liem lived in Batavia where he reportedly attended lectures at the law school Rechts Hogeschool. In 1936, he criticised the nationalist Dr Soetomo, who had identified Japan as a model for Indonesian modernization. According to Liem, Japan was a dangerous imperialist power. He continued his criticism of Japan in a 1938 book, Tiongkok dan Djepang.Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), pp. 61-62. Liem was briefly imprisoned during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, but was released due to his connection with Mrs Honda, an acquaintance from the Japanese community in Surabaya. He then worked as assistant to the head of the head of the Chinese Section of the Japanese Consulate in Batavia.Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), pp. 63. In 1945, Liem was selected as a member of the Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia. In this position, he argued that Chinese Indonesians should automatically receive Indonesian citizenship. In 1947, he was a member of the delegation of the Indonesian Republic that negotiated the Renville Agreement. In 1951 he was owner of a pharmacy in Tanah Abang, Jakarta. In that year, he was arrested and detained on orders of the government of Soekiman Wirjosandjojo on suspicion of leftist sympathies. This incident was a great disappointment to him. Impressed with developments in China under the Chinese Communist Party, he renounced his Indonesian citizenship.Leo Suryadinata, \\"The search for national identity of an Indonesian Chinese : a political biography of Liem Koen Hian\\", Archipel 14 (1977), p. 68.

The theorem was proved by Mikhail Kadets (1966) and Richard Davis Anderson.  Statement  Every infinite-dimensional, separable Fréchet space is homeomorphic to mathbb{R}^{mathbb{N}}, the Cartesian product of countably many copies of the real line mathbb{R}.  Preliminaries  Kadec norm: A norm cdot on a normed linear space X is called a Kadec norm with respect to a total subset Asubset X^* of the dual space X^* if for each sequence x_nin X the following condition is satisfied: * If lim_{ntoinfty}x^*(x_n)=x^*(x_0) for x^*in A and lim_{ntoinfty}x_n=x_0, then lim_{ntoinfty}x_n-x_0=0. Eidelheit theorem: A Fréchet space E is either isomorphic to a Banach space, or has a quotient space isomorphic to mathbb{R}^{mathbb{N}}. Kadec renorming theorem: Every separable Banach space X admits a Kadec norm with respect to a countable total subset A subset X^* of X^*. The new norm is equivalent to the original norm cdot of X. The set A can be taken to be any weak-star dense countable subset of the unit ball of X^*  Sketch of the proof  In the argument below E denotes an infinite-dimensional separable Fréchet space and simeq the relation of topological equivalence (existence of homeomorphism). A starting point of the proof of the Anderson–Kadec theorem is Kadec's proof that any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space is homeomorphic to mathbb{R}^{mathbb{N}}. From Eidelheit theorem, it is enough to consider Fréchet space that are not isomorphic to a Banach space. In that case there they have a quotient that is isomorphic to mathbb{R}^{mathbb{N}}. A result of Bartle-Graves-Michael proves that then :Esimeq Ytimes mathbb{R}^{mathbb{N}} for some Fréchet space Y. On the other hand, E is a closed subspace of a countable infinite product of separable Banach spaces X=prod_{n=1}^{infty}X_i of separable Banach spaces.

She served as the Vice President of the Welfare Council of New York, as Vice Chairman of the National Women's Committee on Welfare and Relief Mobilization, and as Board Chairman of the Girl Scouts of the USA. In 1926 she was ennobled by Pope Pius XI, becoming a papal duchess in her own right. In 1934 she became the first woman to receive an honorary degree from Georgetown University.  Biography  Genevieve Garvan was born on April 11, 1880, in Hartford, Connecticut, to Patrick Garvan and Mary Carroll. Her brother was Francis Patrick Garvan. A sister joined the Sisters of Mercy in Hartford, Connecticut. She was raised in the Catholic faith. She attended the Sacred Heart Convent in Providence, Rhode Island, and graduated from the College of the Sacred Heart in Westchester County, New York, before pursuing further studies in Dresden and Paris. Garvan married Nicholas Frederic Brady on August 11, 1906. Her husband, who was raised Episcopalian, converted to Catholicism before their wedding. During World War I she purchased the Old Colony Club in New York City and lent it to the United States government as a mobilization center for nurses training for service in Europe. After the war she was decorated by the French government for her financial aid to refugees and she was awarded the Order of the Crown by Albert I of Belgium. In the 1920s Garvan and her husband spent winters at the palace Casa del Sole in Rome to work within Vatican affairs. Her husband, who was later given the title of papal duke, was the first American to be inducted into the Supreme Order of Christ, the highest chivalric order awarded by the Pope. She was made a papal duchess in 1926 by Pope Pius XI. She was also made a Dame of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a Dame of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, and received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. Under First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt she served as vice chairman of the National Women's Committee on Welfare and Relief Mobilization. She was the founder of the Carroll Club, a society for Catholic businesswomen, and the board chairman for the Girl Scouts of the USA. In 1936, a property she donated to the Girl Scouts was named Camp Genevieve Brady in her honor. She served as vice president of the Welfare Council of New York. In 1934 she received the University of Notre Dame's Laetare Medal as the most notable lay Catholic in America. In 1934 she received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Georgetown University president W. Coleman Nevils, the first woman awarded an honorary degree at the university. She and her husband lived at 910 Fifth Avenue in New York City and at Inisfada, their Tudor Revival estate in Manhasset, New York. They entertained and hosted various high-ranking Catholic officials, including Francis Spellman and the future Pope Pius XII. In 1937, she gifted the estate, including 250 acres of land and an 87-room mansion, to the New York Province of the Society of Jesus, which used it as a seminary before converting it into the St. Ignatius Jesuit Retreat House in 1963. Its chapel was dedicated to St. Genevieve. Her husband died in 1930, leaving her his entire estate valued at $12 million. She, in turn, donated 95 works of art that same year to the newly established Jesuit novitiate in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, one of which was later identified as the work of Tintoretto. On March 6, 1937, Brady married William Babington Macaulay, the Irish Free State minister to the Vatican, in a private ceremony witnessed only by clergy and held without notice because Macaulay's presence was required in Rome. She died in Rome on November 24, 1938, after a brief illness. She was buried next to her first husband in a crypt below the main altar at the Novitiate of St. Isaac Jogues in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. A plaque at the Church of St. Patrick in Rome commemorates her financial contributions to the Catholic Church. Her estate was valued at almost $6 million, much of it bequeathed to the Carroll Club and other charities.

The company, headquartered in Los Gatos, California, was founded by Praveen Kankariya, CEO of Impetus Technologies. The software provides OLAP- based multidimensional analysis on big data and cloud platforms and was launched officially in June 2015. In December the same year, the company was listed among the 10 Coolest Big Data Startups of 2015 by CRN Magazine.  Technology  The software uses OLAP technology to enable business intelligence on the cloud and big data platforms. In a report published by Forrester Research in 2016, where they evaluated several native Hadoop business intelligence (BI) platforms on 22 parameters, Kyvos was referred to as a platform that gave new life to OLAP by bringing it to Hadoop. As per the report, Kyvos enables analysis on Hadoop based on OLAP schemas, aggregations, and predefined drill-down paths. It pre-calculates aggregates at multiple levels of dimensional hierarchies to improve query response times as compared to SQL-on-Hadoop platforms. Users can analyze data through the Kyvos visualization tool or by using other BI platforms. Kyvos was originally built for Hadoop and later on added support for Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Initially, it supported only MDX queries and integrated with data visualization tools such as Excel and Tableau. In 2017, Kyvos 4.0 added support for SQL connectivity extending integration to other BI tools such as Business Objects, Cognos, MicroStrategy, Power BI and Qlik. In late 2018, Version 5 of the software was built specifically for the cloud with elastic OLAP to provide a cloud native way to scale up and down for changing data workloads. With its 2020.2 release, Kyvos added support for Snowflake data warehouse. The product was also made available on Microsoft Azure marketplace and Amazon Web Services marketplace.

Biography  = Early life and career = Raffaello's mother, Clotilde Staderini, died from childbirth when Raffaello was only eleven. Because of this, much of his education came from the cultural and moral guidance of his father Francesco. A native magistrate of Monterotondo, of secular and reformist culture, Francesco Giovagnoli became involved in the revolutionary experience of the Roman Republic, and when he fell he was sent to confinement by pontifical tribunals. Meanwhile, the young man had already shown very precocious signs of intellectual curiosity: introduced to Ancient Roman history, at just ten years of age he had finished reading the classic historians, which was followed by studies of philosophy and Italian and Latin literature in the decade 1850–59, in Monterotondo, where his father was confined. This broad cultural background allowed him to make his debut in journalism, but his patriotic impetus prompted him to volunteer and set off with his three brothers Ettore, Mario, and Fabio. On the occasion of the untimely death of the latter, the four Giovagnoli brothers were described by Giuseppe Garibaldi as \\"\\". La Battle of Mentana, which closed the campaign of the Roman Agro on November 3, 1867 After a training course, from 1862 and for five years, Giovagnoli was a professor of literary subjects at the School for non-commissioned officers, an activity that he interrupted in 1866 to take part in Third War of Independence; resigned from the army, together with his brothers he joined the Garibaldian ranks in the unfortunate Campaign of the Roman Agro for the liberation of Rome, an enterprise of the Roman Agro. = Cultural commitment = Alongside the military occupations, Raffaello Giovagnoli did not fail to cultivate his literary, historical and artistic passions. He broadened his literary horizons by studying foreign authors – Shakespeare, Schiller and Béranger; resumed his work as a journalist, working for the Whistle , the Spirit, and then for the Century and Gazzetta di Firenze, newspaper which hosted the serial publication of Evelina, his first novel which reached some degree of popularity among readers. Equally successful they had had two previous works of his, the comedies Un caro giovane of 1866, and The widow of Putifarre of the following year; and the same consensus of the public had Audacity and shyness of 1870. Spartacus , published in installments on the Fanfulla in 1873-4, reconstructs the rebellion led by slave trace and emphasizes the brutality of human enslavement. Giovagnoli wrote the novel at the café of Valle theater, where a group of intellectuals gathered, including Luigi Arnaldo Vassallo and Pietro Cossa, with whom the scholar formed the League of spelling. He was also the author of historical essays: Ciceruacchio and don Pirlone. Historical recollections of the Roman revolution from 1846 to 1849 , Pellegrino Rossi and the Roman revolution , The Italian Risorgimento from 1815 to 1848 , works that highlight the wide popular participation in revolutionary movements. Returning to the press, he fervently engaged in various journalistic activities: he helped found the newspaper La Capitale which he directed for a few months but which he disagreed with the publishing property passing to Il Diavolo rosa . Even this newspaper had a similar political coloring of the 'Capital', and was also sensitive to the aspirations of the First International. He also collaborated in Universal Suffrage and was editor of 'La Stampa' in Rome and Don Pirloncino , which through the satire hit the line-up of the Right and the clergy. In the eighties he was responsible for the literary page of the Capitan Fracassa , then he ventured into the political satire of the Don Quixote della Mancha and finally wrote for La Tribuna . It was finally in the mid-nineties, in the board of Parliament , a newspaper that supported Giovanni Giolitti. Giovagnoli worked as a journalist as a journalist. Professor of Letters in Rome in 1874, four years later he was in Venice as a teacher at Liceo Foscarini, then again in Rome. Here since 1903 he taught History of the Risorgimento at the University, and after a period of waiting by parliamentary term he closed his career as director of the faculty of the Magisterium. = Political activity = Convinced anticlerical and advocate of a secular society and not conditioned by material or cultural interventions of religious order, Raffaello Giovagnoli militated in the ranks of the Left. He manifested his radical ideas through the writings in the press, with attacks on Alfonso La Marmora accused of giving in to the Church, and raising criticism of the corruption of Bettino Ricasoli politics. . He also held the office of municipal and provincial councilor in the decade between the seventies and eighties, elected in the districts of Rome and Tivoli, fighting in favor of the farmers and people of Lazio affected by the consequences of the earthquake of 1892. Over time, his radical political positions were diluted until they became contiguous with the conservatism of Francesco Crispi, to whom Giovagnoli, associating him with Cavour, attributed wisdom in restoring action, ability to know how to interpret the needs of the moment, skill and intelligence in the work of colonialism; as well as, in contradiction with previous positions, it ended with the hope of a recomposition of the civil sphere with the religious one. Freemason, he was a member of the Loggia Tito Vezio of Rome, in which it was begun around 1875; in 1877 he represented the Loggia The Light of the Balkans of Belgrade, belonging to the Great East of Italy, to the Masonic General Assembly of Rome. He died on July 15, 1915 in Rome. Works * Realistic novels: ** Evelina, 1868; ** Natalina.

In 1969 in Poland, about Grushinsky was released half-hour TV movie Numer 149850.Remember Your Name on Mosfilm It could also be inspired by a ten-minute documentary, Children of the Rams (Dzieci rampy, 1963), directed by Andrzej Piekutowski, showing among the survivors of Auschwitz a girl who found, several years after the war, her real parents in the Soviet Union. Plot On the day of Germany's attack on the USSR Zina Vorobyova, a resident of Belorussia, is born the son of Gene. After a while they get to Auschwitz, where after quarantine they are resettled in different barracks, but Zina, as far as possible, always visits Gene and feeds him. Toward the end of the war, because of the Soviet offensive, Zina falls into the Marsh of Death, and when she leaves she is horrified to see that the barrack in which her son is located is boarded up - the children are clearly going to kill. Then, after the war, during the return, Zina finds out from her husband's friend who happened to meet on unexpected occasions that he died on the very first day of the war, and from shock he loses sight. She struggles to recover, settles in Leningrad, where she then starts working in a quality laboratory at a TV production plant, but does not give up trying to find Gena, because she is sure that he is alive. She constantly sends inquiries to Poland to the Auschwitz museum, when she learns that this organization actively helps in search of the missing children of the former prisoners of the camp. Once she sees on TV newsreels about Auschwitz, shot by Soviet soldiers after liberation, and finds out in the crowd of liberated children to Gena. In parallel, it is shown that Gena is really alive. After the war, he and other unclaimed children find themselves in an improvised shelter, where the former prisoner of Auschwitz, the Polish Halina Truschinska, is interested in him. Gena by that time no longer speaks Russian, but only in Polish and German, and thinks he is French (his name is Gene, he is rewriting to the Polish Genak). After some time Galina adopts the Gen, and now his name is Eugeniusz Trushchinsky. Years pass, and the grown Eugeniusz becomes a sea captain. One day he and his girlfriend come to the Auschwitz museum for an excursion and experience a shock when, while watching the same newsreel that Zina saw, she sees herself in the frame. The director of the museum invites him to his room and, upon learning his number, informs him about Zina's request. Despite internal contradictions, Eugeniusz comes to Leningrad and reunites with his own mother, but after a while leaves, because in Poland he now has his own life.

Originally a poet who studied under Jorie Graham at Harvard University, she is known for her lyricism as well as her wide vocal range and unique vibrato. \\"A masterful storyteller that exudes an effortless mystique,\\" she is often compared to Nick Cave for her dark topics and intense stage presence and Leonard Cohen for unique finger- picking style on guitar. She performed, produced and arranged everything on her debut album. It was self-released on November 9, 2018.  Biography  Vera Sola was born Danielle Aykroyd to actor Dan Aykroyd and actress Donna Dixon, in Los Angeles, California. She grew up between New York and Canada. She went to Saint Ann's School (Brooklyn) and graduated from Harvard with a degree in literature. After college, she worked on the radio and as a voice actor. She still provides commercial voice-overs and narration for television and film. Sola is shy about her family by nature, and decided to distance herself from her recognizable name in order to establish a career in music on her own. She has also stated in interviews that though she is proud of her lineage she never really liked her name, but never got around to changing it, so the stage name came about as what she calls a \\"pretentious, sort of scathing inside joke with myself, albeit with a silver lining of sincerity.\\"  Music career  She didn't think of taking up music seriously until she was encouraged by longtime friend songwriter Elvis Perkins to join his touring band. She toured and recorded with Elvis throughout and after his \\"I Aubade\\" album cycle. She credits Elvis with bringing her on stage and still plays bass guitar among other instruments in his band. It wasn't until February 2017 that, after suffering a series of life-changing events, she decided to pursue a solo career in music. She entered the studio to record Shades, and took the name Vera Sola shortly after. In October 2017, she released an EP of Misfits covers, titled Last Caress, which attracted the attention of industry professionals. She released her first single from 'Shades' in August 2018. In November 2018, Rolling Stone Magazine named her one of \\"The Top Ten Country Artists You Need to Know\\", citing her sense of social conscience and comparing her voice to Nancy Sinatra.  Debut album  Sola began to record her first album Shades in February 2017. She performed, arranged, and produced the entire thing on her own. She told Flood Magazine about the process: “...it's the direct result of my reality, personal and global, going up in a dark and disorienting and sad and often very funny blaze...When I finally talked myself into making it, I thought I’d have friends come in and contribute, but the nature of things drew me ultimately towards playing and arranging it all. So...it’s an unbroken vessel of my own energy, for better or worse. It was pure expression without expectation. I never even planned to release it. But here we are.” On it she plays a number of unconventional instruments, including bones, chains and breaking glass. It was self-released on November 9, 2018 to general critical acclaim. Music blog The Line of Best Fit gave it a 9/10, writing: \\"Such is the virtuosity and accomplishment of her playing, Shades is bound with the tight-knit swagger of a group of road wearied sessions players. It’s hard to believe it is the work of just one person.\\" The Sunday Times called her \\"an undeniably singular talent\\" and called 'Shades' an essential new release. French Music magazine Magic gave it a 6/6 and named it the number 2 record of the year calling it an \\"absolute masterpiece\\".  Live Performance  Sola is known for her hypnotic \\"captivating; almost hallucinatory\\" stage presence. She is often described as coming out of a David Lynch film. Even though she was not very well-known, her 2018 performance at the famed Le Guess Who? festival in the Netherlands received rave reviews. Greek blog ClockSound wrote: \\"Her personal, theatrical and modern take on Americana and turn of the century (20s, not 21s) music has me hooked from the moment I walked into the Hertz...Her lyricism and the influence poetry have had on this strongly reminds me of – and this is coming from a very big fan – Leonard Cohen.\\" A live-performance review in Loud and Quiet magazine calls her \\"a Westworld android gone rogue; a living anachronism, capable of both run-of- the-mill stage banter and of occupying the characters of her songs with full force, moving as if possessed by them as she performs.\\" She is known for performing with many different musicians and instruments on stage, including a string quartet. She mainly plays the guitar, which she plays with a unique finger-picking style. She toured the United States opening for Sixto Rodriguez, subject of the Academy Award-winning documentary Searching for Sugar Man. Sola performed at the Bombay Beach Biennale in March 2019 which is a three-day festival in the Southern California desert consisting of art, music, and lectures.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/style/coachella-desert- hipsters-salton-sea.html  References   External links  * Official website 1989 births Living people American female singer-songwriters Harvard University alumni American folk musicians American women poets American voice actresses 21st-century American poets Saint Ann's School (Brooklyn) alumni ","title":"Vera Sola"},{"id":"58423552","text":"Now the People! (; ; ; ; ) is a political movement in the European Union. It was founded in April 2018 by a declaration from Catarina Martins from the Portuguese party Bloco de Esquerda, Pablo Iglesias from the Spanish party Podemos and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of La France Insoumise. After discussions about the austerity policy of the Greek government under Alexis Tsipras and his Syriza party, the leaders of the leftist La France insoumise departed the Party of the European Left, joined by Iglesias and Podemos as well as Martins and Bloco. In June 2018, the Danish Red–Green Alliance, Finnish Left Alliance and the Swedish Left Party co-operated with the French Maintenant le Peuple ! (MLP). The Portuguese, Finnish and Danish parties are members of both Now the People and Party of the European Left. Potere al Popolo, a coalition of several small left-wing parties and organisations in Italy, also \\"lent its support\\" to MLP, calling it \\"a very important call proposed by three of the most popular alternatives from Europe [Left Bloc, Podemos and La France Insoumise], which we cannot ignore.\\" However, as Potere al Popolo did not participate in the 2019 European Parliament election, and as it had no incumbent MEPs in the eighth European Parliament, it is not a full member of MLP. In the European elections, parties associated with MLP won a total of 14 seats. La France Insoumise won six seats, the most out of MLP's constituent parties. In the ninth European Parliament, MLP joined with other left-wing parties and independents, including the Party of the European Left from which MLP split, in the European United Left–Nordic Green Left group. Members There are currently six members of MLP, not including Potere al Popolo (PaP). Except PaP, all are represented in the European Parliament for the ninth term, with three parties (the Red–Green Alliance, the Left Alliance and the Left Party) sending one member to Parliament and another three (Podemos, La France Insoumise and the Left Bloc) sending multiple members. The Unidas Podemos list, which Podemos leads, elected six members to the European Parliament, but only three are members of Podemos and only three sit within MLP in the European Parliament. Two members of Unidas Podemos' list — Manu Pineda and Sira Rego — are members of the United Left (IU) and the third — Ernest Urtasun — is a member of Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV), which itself is a constituent party of the regional alliance Catalunya en Comú (CatComú). None of IU, ICV or CatComú are members of MLP. Furthermore, Urtasun does not sit with European United Left–Nordic Green Left as IU and Podemos do; he sits within the European Greens–European Free Alliance group. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !colspan=2Name !Country !Leader !2019 election list leader !Ideology !Position !Other European party !MEPs !National MPs !Government - ! width=\\"5\\" style=\\"background-color: \\"  Left Bloc  Catarina Martins Marisa Matias Socialism Eco-socialism Euroscepticism Left-wing to far-left European Anti-Capitalist Left Party of the European Left    - ! width=\\"5\\" style=\\"background-color: \\"  We can (within Unidas Podemos)  Pablo Iglesias María Eugenia Rodríguez Palop Democratic socialism Direct democracy Left-wing populism Left-wing None    - ! width=\\"5\\" style=\\"background- color: \\"  France Unbowed (with GRS)  Jean-Luc Mélenchon Manon Aubry Democratic socialism Eco-socialism Anti-globalisation politics Left-wing None    - ! width=\\"5\\" style=\\"background-color: \\"  Red–Green Alliance  Collective leadership Nikolaj Villumsen Socialism Eco-socialism Euroscepticism Left-wing to far-left European Anti-Capitalist Left Party of the European Left Nordic Green Left Alliance    - ! width=\\"5\\" style=\\"background-color: \\"  Left Alliance  Li Andersson Silvia Modig Democratic socialism Eco-socialism Left-wing Party of the European Left Nordic Green Left Alliance    - ! width=\\"5\\" style=\\"background-color: \\"  Left Party  Jonas Sjöstedt Malin Björk Socialism Feminism Euroscepticism Left-wing Nordic Green Left Alliance    } Notes References External links * *Declaration Maintenant le peuple!

Biography Unlike many serial killers, Zaikin grew up in a completely prosperous family. His mother worked in the local school, and his father worked in a factory. However, since childhood, deviations had been evident in his behaviour. Oleg grew up closed and unsociable, and was inclined antisocial behaviour; for example, burning the door of a neighbor's house or destroying school textbooks. He often lied, was dodgy, and was noted as a juvenile offender to the police. In 1992, Zaikin was drafted into the army. After attempting suicide, he was commissioned. According to some reports, Zaikin was sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers in the army. Around this time, he became easily excitable and unpredictable, once even severely beating a friend. At that moment, according to his own account, he felt a previously unknown pleasure, and since then he experienced pleasure when torturing his victims. After the army, Zaikin did not want to work, but it was forced upon him by his father, bringing the young man to his factory where he had worked all his life. A month later, Zaikin and his friends committed a major robbery at the enterprise. Upon learning this, his father hanged himself. Zaikin was under a written undertaking not to leave his home, but disappeared, and was declared wanted as a federal criminal. He got himself fake documents and began to make a living by stealing. The first murder Zaikin committed was killing his female roommate in Chelyabinsk, a year after fleeing from his house. Zaikin beat her badly, but did not calculate the force of the blows, and she died. In 2005, Zaikin killed three people in Yekaterinburg. The victims were a woman and two children aged 3 and 4, all of them raped and strangled. He stole 45 thousand rubles from their apartment. In April 2006, Zaikin committed another murder in Orenburg, and in May, he killed a 49-year- old woman and 16-year-old teenager in Kazan. In August, he kidnapped and raped an 11-year-old girl in the city of Zelenograd, near Moscow. The girl survived, although she received several serious stab wounds. The case received wide publicity, as the girl indicated the temporary whereabouts of the criminal. Also, the maniac committed more murders in Tyumen and Ulan-Ude. He interspersed the murders with hundreds of burglaries. Zaikin would climb in from first floor windows, and would wrap his fingers with adhesive tape so as not to leave fingerprints. He also attempted several more murders, but did not manage to complete them. In addition to all of the above, he also committed several rapes. = Arrest, trial and suicide = Zaikin was identified quickly enough, but due to his roaming criminal ways, he was not arrested for a long time. For his capture, the police appointed a reward. On October 6, 2006, in the Ordzhonikidzhevsky District of Ufa, Zaikin was detained in a rented apartment. In his apartment, a hunting knife measuring 26 centimeters was found, a pack of condoms used during rapes, and, most unusually, an icon. During the investigation, he talked emotionlessly about all the crimes committed in five years. On the aggregate of crimes he was threatened with life imprisonment, but on November 20, 2006, in SIZO No. 1 in the city of Ufa, Zaikin hanged himself with his bed sheets. The criminal case was dismissed in connection with the death of the accused.

History  Opened in 1877 by Abbott Léon Berthé, the school occupies 106 and 108 rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière - two 17th Century houses that were owned during the French Revolution by Baron de Dietrich. It was in the Baron's home in Strasbourg that Rouget de Lisle first sang the La Marseillaise. In October 1877, the school had 142 students. In 1888, the alumni association was formed. In 1929, Jean Delsuc created the 65th Paris Scouts de France at Rocroy Saint-Léon, then a college of Guy de Larigaudie. The college is immediately next door to Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris and its 55th. After the occupation, the school had 660 students, and its new group of teachers included Roger Vrigny, Grand prix de littérature de l'Académie française The primary school became mixed in 1960. The following year, the school entered into a contract of association with the state. In 2008, Rocroy Saint-Léon joined with École Saint-Vincent de Paul and Lycée Petrelle to form the group Rocroy Saint-Vincent de Paul. The new group occupies 3 sites: - The école Saint-Vincent de Paul at 6 rue de Rocroy (Kindergarted, primary, and year six) - The institution Rocroy Saint-Léon at 106, rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière (from year five to year two) - The lycée Pétrelle au 8, rue Pétrelle (first and last year). In 2012, the establishment had 1750 students. Today, Rocroy Saint-Vincent de Paul accepts students from kindergarten to the final year, and after their studies, many continue on to classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles, especially in medical education ou de law.  Lycée ranking  In 2015, the lycée ranked 13th out of 109 at départemental level in teaching quality, and 132nd at national level. The ranking is based on three criteria: the level of bac results, the proportion of students who obtain the baccalauréat having spent their last two years in the establishment, and the added value (calculated based on the social origin of the students, their age, and their national diploma results). Since 2010, the lycée has always achieved at least 80% of honours and 99% of baccalauréat results.  See also  * Souvenirs De L'école Rocroy Saint-Léon.

It was a signature composition of the Modern Jazz Quartet, of which Lewis was the pianist and musical director. Background and structure Lewis wrote \\"Django\\" in 1954 as a tribute to his friend, the Belgian-born jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, who had died the previous year. It begins with a 20-bar theme that was described by Ted Gioia in his book The Jazz Standards as dirge-like and mournful. The entry for \\"django\\" in the original edition of the Real Book only contained the chord changes for this theme. It is followed by solo sections in modified Thirty-two-bar AABA form, where the first two A sections contain six bars instead of eight, the eight-bar B section contains a pedal point on the tonic, and the final twelve-bar A section contains a boogie bass motif. The solo sections are separated by interludes in double-time derived from the introductory theme. The composition ends with a full repeat of the introductory section. It was first recorded on December 23, 1954 by the Modern Jazz Quartet, of which Lewis was the pianist and musical director. It appeared on the group's 1955 10-inch album The Modern Jazz Quartet, Vol. 2 (PRLP 170) and their 1956 12-inch LP Django (PRLP 7057), as well as being released as a 45 RPM single with part 1 on side A and part 2 on side B. It was one of the Modern Jazz Quartet's signature compositions, with the group's bassist Percy Heath recalling that \\"If we didn't play 'Django' in a concert, we risked getting stoned.

The 1913 house was reputedly designed by Edward Jeaffreson Jackson and built from 1830 to 1913. It is also known as Thrupp's Cottage; Craignathan; The Hastings; Milton. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site of Hastings, including earlier (remains of) houses, has important historical associations with a range of maritime industries, in particular whaling and also with pioneers such as Alfred Thrupp, John McLaren and Benjamin Boyd. The Hastings boarding house is indicative of the building boom of the early 1900s, which resulted in the creation of a coherent architectural styled suburb, the Federation Neutral Bay, for which, to this date, the suburb is well known. Being on the waterfront, Hastings formed a gateway to this important suburb and it would appear that it was probably one of the first large Federation period houses to have been erected on the northern foreshores of Sydney Harbour.RNE, 1989 =Garden= The site includes a stone wall which may be associated with \\"Thrupps Cottage\\" or \\"Craignathan\\" (1830s), both important early houses.LEP, 2013 Within the grounds are several notable archaeological remains, including stone stairs which once lead to Thrupp's Cottage (possibly the earliest building on the North Shore), remains of a woolstore (built around 1831 and demolished 1884), remains of a reservoir and associated conduits constructed prior to 1842 and the cellar walls of Craignathan, one of the earliest of the more formal houses of the North Shore. The following historic relics, located on the Hastings site, determine its cultural significance: # Thrupp's cottage remains; # the cellars of Craignathan; # the relics associated with whaling and other maritime activities, e.g. shipping of produce for storage in the woolstore. =House (1904-13)= The building \\"Hastings\\" is attributed to the architect E. Jefferson Jackson. Constructed in 1904 it was used primarily as a boarding house under various proprietors until 1956 when it was purchased by the Commonwealth of Australia. The Department of Defence purchased the property for use by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a headquarters for its support units. Hastings was substantially altered to accommodate the new military uses, with a considerable amount of structural alteration in the area now corresponding to Unit 3. A new porch and entry was added on the south side for the RAAF Chiefs of Staff and many internal changes were undertaken: removal of walls and parts of walls; blocking doors; and making new door openings. At this time the first floor did not extend as far west as it does now and there was no second floor on the western side of the building. It appears that the early ground floor additions of the late Federation period in this area were demolished during the period of occupation by the RAAF. In the late 1980s the Australian Government disposed of the property. In October 1988 North Sydney Council approved a building application to convert Hastings into three apartments. The plans, prepared by Gary Rothwell, architect, show that the most significant changes occurring at the western part of the building to create Unit No. 3. Hastings the house was built between 1904–13, a large, dramatically designed Federation Arts and Crafts style house on an important harbourside site. Its design is attributed to noted architect E. Jeaffreson Jackson. In 1989 approval was given for restoration works to Hastings and for landscaping works around it. Altered plans for landscaping work were approved in 1990. In 1995 approval was given for a new verandah. Craignathan manor was later replaced by an boutique block of six executive apartments. Approval was given in 2008 for alterations to 1st & 2nd floor including installation of lift, new balcony & extension of dining/living room. The same year approval was granted to extend dining & living space, enclose veranda, install lift, reconfigure stair, juliet balcony over extension, extend external retaining wall, landscape element relocations and addition to conservatory.

Its design is attributed to noted architect E Jeaffreson Jackson. It forms a part of the collection of large fine houses in the vicinity. Two storey brick house with attic rooms below a multi-gabled roof of terracotta tiles. It features a roughcast rendered upper floor and square tower with battlemented parapet, bracketed, oriel windows, timber shingled gable ends, and sills and lintels and windows, dramatic arched brick verandah entries and timber slat balustrades to upper verandahs. A fine example of Federation Arts and Crafts style, with asymmetrical composition and a steep roof with deep gables. The brick render and shingle facade treatment of the different levels provide textures and colour to the elevations. The bay windows and intricate joinery provide further interest and also relief to the formal facades.

A two-storey Federation Arts and Crafts style residential building () with much of its original details intact. It was built on the site of Thrupp's cottage, one of the earliest buildings on the North Shore and has been leased throughout the years as a high class boarding house. More recently it has been owned by the Commonwealth Government and used by the Department of Defence (Air Force). The house has been converted into units. The interior of Unit 4 is significantly modified. Unit 1 retains decorative features including plaster ceiling roses, cornices, joinery. Tesselated tiles on balcony. Notwithstanding the substantial changes it has experienced, 2 Hayes Street presents as a fine example of the Federation period Arts and Crafts style. The additions and alterations in the 1980s have captured the characteristics of this distinctive style, maintaining the typical asymmetry and variations in the use of architectural forms and devices. To the extent that the new work blends so successfully with the retained original fabric and features the aesthetic and technical values of the building are somewhat false because it is only after a close inspection on site and study of drawings that the various phases of the buildings evolution can be understood.Heritage Division report, July 2008 IDA. = Condition = The site still retains architectural evidence of earlier occupation in the form of stone steps associated with Thrupp's Cottage (possibly the oldest residence on the North Shore), remains of a woolstore (), a reservoir and associated conduits () and, to the west, the stone cellar walls of Craignathan, also built and operated as an early twentieth century boarding house. The building's internal fabric has been substantially altered to convert it to three residential units, leaving no clear physical evidence of tis origins as a boarding house or its use as the headquarters of the support units of the RAFF from 1956 to the mid 1980s. However, the imposing presence of its exterior in this prominent location serves to preserve the record of its origins and use and the history of urban development along the northern shoreline of Sydney Harbour.Heritage Impact Statement, HBO EMTB Heritage, April 2008 = Modifications and dates = *1956Purchased by the Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence for use by the Royal Australian Air Force as a headquarters for its support units.

The character made his first screen appearance on 1 February 2018. The character was introduced as one of Home and Away's new River Boys, who are a fictional criminal gang that reside in Mangrove River. The show had previously included actors playing the River Boys in their regular cast, most notably the Braxton brothers. They became popular with viewers and were led by actor Steve Peacocke as Darryl Braxton. When O'Connor joined the show he felt pressured to live up to the \\"legacy\\" Peacocke had created on the show. He watched old episodes and researched the role with two former cast members who played River Boys. Dean is characterised as \\"extremely loyal\\" and \\"protective\\" of his family and friends. He likes to try to be \\"the top dog\\" of his gang. Dean's affiliation with the River Boys meant that writers could develop crime stories for the character. He was given immediate links to other characters, such as his friend Ash (George Mason) and his ex-girlfriend Willow Harris (Sarah Roberts). The show also introduced a fellow River Boy, Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin) who left the gang to join the police force. Their troubled past and friendship is prominently featured in Dean's story. Writers paired Dean with Willow and her gambling addiction leads Dean into committing credit card fraud and robberies and leaving him in debt to a loan shark. To explore his backstory producers introduced Dean's family, which included his troubled mother Karen Thompson (Georgia Adamson), his long- lost father Rick Booth (Mark Lee) and a half-sister Kayla Booth (Audrey Blyde). Casting The character and O'Connor's casting were announced on 13 January 2018. The actor began filming his first scenes five months prior to the announcement. He had previously auditioned for other characters, and came close to securing the roles, before being cast as Dean. This is O'Connor's first acting role. Of joining the show, he stated \\"Home and Away is obviously known as a launch pad for many actors’ careers. Obviously going into the type of role that this is, being a River Boy and there being a story there already that is so big and well known, it means there is a legacy there to play around with and being a bad boy on the show is exciting.\\" The character's appearance was first teased in a trailer showcasing some of the upcoming 2018 storylines. Dean made his first appearance on 1 February 2018. Development =Characterisation= Brax, who was played by actor Steve Peacocke (pictured). Dean is a member of the show's River Boys group, who were introduced in 2011 with the arrival of the Braxton brothers. Dean was branded \\"the new bad boy of Summer Bay\\" by Jonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph. O'Connor told a reporter from New Idea that playing a \\"bad boy on Home And Away is something a lot of actors want to do.\\" He added that it allowed him to have fun with the drama the character creates. While O'Connor described him as \\"cheeky\\" and said that he loves AFL. The actor added that he likes that his character has tattoos, as he has always wanted one. O'Connor felt honoured to play a River Boy because he believed their backstory and role in Home and Away to be iconic. He told a 7plus reporter that \\"the role of a River Boy is appealing to me because of the rebellious nature of the character. As a teenager I’d always wanted to test the boundaries and I feel as though I can do that within the role of Dean.\\" The actor believed that Dean is \\"ambitious\\" and finds joy in being \\"the top dog\\". Dean has fought hard for anything he had in life and this shows during interactions with other characters. O'Connor also stated that the character \\"cares deeply about the people he loves, he’s fiercely loyal and he can become very protective of them.\\" O'Connor described Dean as being \\"extremely loyal\\" and \\"quite protective\\" of friends and family, but criticised Dean's bad persona stating \\"the way he goes about things in life, I would never go down that path.\\" The original incarnation of the River Boys proved to be successful with viewers. Introducing more characters linked to them added pressure because of high expectations from fans. The original leader of the River Boys was Brax (Steve Peacocke). O'Connor was nervous about playing the new leader because he believed that Peacocke created \\"such a legacy\\" with his character. He tried to make an effort to play Dean as a River Boy that is different to Brax. O'Connor told a reporter from TV Week that \\"I want to be different and make this role my own, but at the same time, keep in touch with what it is to be a River Boy.\\" To prepare for his portrayal of Dean, O'Connor watched old episodes of Home and Away that feature the river boys. He also met with Lincoln Younes and Nic Westaway, who played Casey and Kyle Braxton respectively who offered him advice. O'Connor believed that viewers came to like the character because they know Dean's actions come from a place of \\"love and protection\\". He told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that \\"although Dean is a smartass with a bit of attitude, he's still a little boy inside just wanting to find his place in the bay.\\" The actor claimed that Dean's story had resonated with fans so well they would even approach him to offer their advice regarding the character's bad behaviour. =Introduction= Home and Away's publicity team released a trailer to create hype for the character's arrival in the show. Dean arrives in Summer Bay to help out Ash. He contacts Dean to help him track down and attack Robbo (Jake Ryan) who he believes is responsible for the death of Kat Chapman (Pia Miller). Dean and Willow's past is complicated and they used to date each other. Dean causes trouble for Willow and her boyfriend Justin Morgan (James Stewart) by sneaking into her caravan. The incident leads Justin to accuse Willow of sleeping with Dean. But she makes it clear to Justin that she is not interested in Dean. Writers also included a link to fellow new character Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin), a police officer who was once a member of the River Boy gang. He and Dean were best friends and Dean agrees to keep their past a secret, but this causes tension between them. A Home and Away public relations worker stated that the two characters became estranged following a failed car robbery. Colby asked Dean to steal a car and let him take sole blame when he was caught. During an episode in which Colby tries to make amends for the botched robbery they end up in a fight. Dean collapses and is rushed to hospital where Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger) succeeds in saving his life. When Justin's daughter Ava Gilbert (Grace Thomas) is kidnapped by the Easton family, Dean helps Colby. When Dean attacks Boyd Easton (Steve Le Marquand), he tries to run over Dean. To protect his friend Colby shoots and kills Boyd. The incident helps them salvage their friendship and their secret remains hidden. Boyd's sister Ebony Harding (Cariba Heine) discovers their connection and informs the local news paper leading to Colby losing his job. =Willow and debts= Willow breaks-up with Justin and seduces Dean.Home and Away writers then romantically paired Dean with her instead. The character's relationship soon becomes difficult as Willow still loves Justin. Roberts believed that her character initially intended to use Dean to move on from Justin. She added Willow is not really interested in a serious relationship but \\"Dean talks her round\\". Dean later torments Justin over their relationship which leads to Justin punching Dean. Dean struggles to find a new job and she is forced to cover both of their rent to stay at the caravan park. Willow resorts to stealing from the gym in which she works to pay their rent. Willow also has a gambling addiction which begins to rule her life. She down plays her addiction but Dean is not fooled by her lies. Roberts said that \\"Dean knows her so well and can usually help her when things go wrong, but this time, it seems she's in too deep.\\" Willow and Dean begin squatting in Colby's apartment and Dean borrows money from a loan shark. He realises that they cannot repay the money and he conjures up a plan to skim credit cards. He tampers with the card payment machine inside the local restaurant Salt. When they exit the building, they knock Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) to the ground and leave him unconscious. Writers continued to heighten the danger surrounding Dean when he is beaten up by his loan shark. Dean and Willow worry when Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes the first victim of their card skimming. Dean ends their relationship because be believes that she will not overcome her gambling addiction if they remain together. Willow is upset and Dean also does it to protect her from getting hurt by his loan shark, Brett (Graeme McRae). Roberts told a TV Week reporter that \\"they're not good for each other, but she can't get out of the rabbit hole, as long as they're together, they'll keep losing themselves and end up in risky situations.\\" She also believed that Dean and Willow are \\"not good for each other\\". The actress told Sarah Ellis (Inside Soap) that they had a \\"whirlwind relationship\\" and that viewers \\"love their history\\" but it would have been worrying had they remained together. Dean tries to repay his debt but his loan shark Brett demands payment. Dean explains that he cannot pay but offers to get involved with Brett's criminal activities to clear the debt. Brett agrees and orders Dean to look after a backpack filled with cash and drop it off to an associate. O'Connor told a TV Week columnist that \\"there's a very high chance Dean could end up in jail if things turn sour.\\" Brett tells Dean that he must help commit a robbery at Salt to clear his debt. Dean is unwilling to rob from Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood) and asks Colby for help. He suggests they inform the police and set a trap to have Brett arrested. Working with the police is forbidden within the River Boys gang. O'Connor told Maddison Hockey (TV Week) that Dean is \\"so loyal to his River Boys\\" but knows he must make an exception and participate with the police sting to keep himself and Willow safe. Brody and his wife Ziggy Astoni (Sophie Dillman) are still inside Salt when the robbery takes place. They are forced to hide in a storeroom and let the robbery happen. Dillman told Nikki Black from New Idea that the plot was \\"such a shock and so frightening for Ziggy and Brody.\\" O'Connor said his character protects Ziggy and Brody from coming to any harm from Brett. The actors enjoyed creating the scenes. O'Connor told Black \\"they were so much fun, it was like playing cops and robbers.\\" Willow is arrested for assaulting Alf and credit card fraud at Salt. Dean decides to confess to sole involvement in both crimes so that Willow is released. Dean is released on bail until the case goes to court. He realises he has ruined his life and wants to leave Summer Bay. Roberts believed that Willow had caused all of Dean's misfortune and he did not deserve a prison sentence. Her character \\"desperately\\" wants change everything and asks Justin to help Dean. Writers began further development on the friendship between Dean and Ziggy. When the pair get drunk together, an angry Brody accuses Dean of purposely getting his wife drunk. Dillman said that \\"poor Dean always seems to get in trouble and get the blame for everything.\\" Dean is given community service as a result of his court case. =Family issues= Producers hired Georgia Adamson to play Dean's estranged mother Karen Thompson to explore Dean's backstory. Her introduction into the series was linked with Dean's court case, he makes contact with her to inform her of the trial and she ignores him. The actor told Inside Soap's Ellis that Dean wants Karen back in his life because he feels she is the only person that he can be honest with. Karen has mental health issues and drink and drug problems. She has a history of violence and had been an unstable influence on Dean during his childhood. Karen arrives in Summer Bay when Dean is trying to keep busy with his community service. O'Connor told Jackie Brygel from New Idea that \\"I think he does want to get back on the straight and narrow. But now his mum turns up.\\" Willow and Colby are unhappy with Karen's arrival. Colby remembers Karen's \\"terrible mood swings\\" and Willow reveals that Karen once threatened Dean with a knife which resulted in him ceasing contact with her. Karen causes trouble for Dean when she clashes with John Palmer (Shane Withington) over Dean's community service. Angered by the confrontation she tries to run John over but instead crashes the vehicle causing herself harm. O'Connor told TV Week's Tamara Cullen that \\"after the crash, he realises that her being in the Bay in her current state will only cause more drama, his persistent requests for her to get help makes Karen become defensive.\\" John reports Karen to the police and Colby tries to convince Dean to have his mother sectioned to avoid charges. Dean signs the commitment papers which prompts Karen to run away. When Karen returns Dean tries to convince her to seek help once again. She behaves erratic and hits Dean over the head with a frying pan, knocking him unconscious. Karen then turns the gas on and they both spend an entire night passed out and exposed to toxic fumes. The following morning Willow and Chelsea Campbell (Ashleigh Brewer) save both Dean and Karen, following this she is detained in a mental health facility. Writers soon explored Dean's paternal family via Karen's secret past. On-screen Dean and Colby find a hidden suitcase belonging to Karen. Inside they find out that Karen knew who Dean's biological father was and had lied to him. O'Connor told a reporter from New Idea that Dean never knew the identity of his father because Karen kept it a secret following a deal she had made with the man. Dean accepted that he would never know his biological father. The actor believed that his an absent father had taught Dean to be independent from a young age. Finding out that he can find his father upsets him and O'Connor added that \\"he's quite anxious about the prospect that he could learn about his father now, it brings up an old wound of growing up without a father.\\" Dean discovers his father is a wealthy man named Rick Booth (Mark Lee) and visits him. Rick explains that Karen only told him about Dean following his birth. Rick had already had a child with another woman at this point and purchased Karen a house so she would keep away. Dean also discovers that he has a half-sister Kayla Booth (Audrey Blyde) and soon realises that Rick is not interested in getting to know him. Reception A TV Week reporter believed that Dean had \\"remarkably similar traits\\" to the original River Boy leader Brax. While Maddison Hockey said that TV Week staff had been eagerly anticipating Dean's arrival ever since Home and Away released the first teaser trailer featuring him. Abi Moustafa from Who magazine said that Dean's introduction into the show was a \\"new and interesting storyline\\". Michael Darling from Soaplife said that \\"Justin may have not wiped the smile off Dean's face, but the news he's being played for a fool will.\\" His colleague Claire Crick opined that \\"Dean Thompson hasn't made a lot of friends since arriving in Summer Bay.\\" Penelope Baker from Soap World said that \\"hottie Patrick O'Connor has had us enthralled for months as the scheming Dean Thompson, Summer Bay's new favourite bad boy.\\" Fellow Soap World writer John Burfitt said \\"this man is never afraid of a fight and doesn't care who it's with – as long as he gets his own way.\\" They added that Dean and Willow's story took a \\"wild turn\\". Seth Adamson from TV Soap said that Dean and Colby were the next generation of the River Boys and \\"that clash is sure to make for some potent drama.\\" In the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards, O'Connor was nominated for \\"Best Soap Newcomer\\"; he came in thirteenth place with 1.8% of the total votes.

Assan ran several pharmacies and wine shops which enabled him to purchase the machinery and build the mill. After Assan's death in 1866, the mill was taken over by his wife, Alexandrina.

Between 1992 and 1995, he committed more than 70 crimes in Krasnoyarsk and its environs, including 19 murders and 8 attempted murders. He is considered one of the most terrible serial killers in the history of the Krasnoyarsk Krai.После каждого нападения маньяк заполнял таблицу // Московский комсомолец : газета. — М., 1999. — 29 января. — ISSN 1562-1987. Архивировано 6 марта 2016.  Biography  Little is known about Ershov's early life. In May 1991, he was drafted into the Soviet Army, and served in the Far East. During his service, he was subjected to bullying by other soldiers. Once he attacked one of the abusers, beat him with a brick and hit him several times with a knife, then deserted and returned to Krasnoyarsk. Soon Ershov raped a 16-year- old vocational school student on the banks of the Yenisei River, but left her alive. Then, on November 28, 1992, he raped and hammered a 42-year-old foodservice employee with a stick. Over the next three years, he committed another 18 rapes of women, 15 of which resulted in murder. Victims of the maniac were both young girls and elderly women. One of the investigators recalled: \\"I got the impression that he was killing to hide traces of his crimes; in one case - rape, in another - robbery. How to erase traces...The beast. He is the beast - purely animal instincts.\\" In parallel, Ershov committed about 40 robberies, some of which resulted in the killing of victims. One of them was a policeman who tried to detain him. While trying to capture the criminal, the main forces of the Krasnoyarsk police were abandoned. However, he was detained by accident. On October 29, 1995, the maniac attacked a 16-year-old girl and tried to take off her gold chain. Her cries were heard by relatives, and Ershov tried to hide. From the two men he met, he managed to fight off one with a knife, but one of the local women knocked him out with a fire extinguisher. A police squad arrived and took Ershov to the Railroad Police Department of Krasnoyarsk. The nuances of Ershov's detention vary according to information from various sources. According to the newspaper \\"Moskovskij Komsomolets\\", he was struck with a fire extinguisher, while according to Irina Petrakovoy, a journalist from Gazeta.ru, Ershov was arrested by a policeman he had wounded with a knife. From the newspaper \\"Trud\\" it is implied that Ershov attacked a woman at the entrance of her house whose husband was an officer of the Federal Security Service, whom chased after and captured Ershov. According to information from journalist and writer Nikolai Modestov: \\"..at the time of Ershov's arrest, in accordance to the three murders, innocent people were already convicted.\\" = Trial and sentence = Initially, Ershov refused to give evidence, called himself with a false name and claimed to be a tramp. Later, while confessing to law enforcement officials, he pointed to his real residence where irrefutable evidence was found - the tools of the crime (two knives that he called \\"feathers\\"), as well as the belongings of the victims (old jacket and a worn coat) and their passports. An important clue against Ershov was his diary of seven columns, in which he wrote down all his attacks in detail: the first column - the number of the victim, the second - the time of year, the third - the instrument of the crime (capital \\"P\\" - committed with a knife; capital \\"N\\" - committed with a table knife; \\"p\\" - crime committed by hands or with a stick), the fourth - the nature of the injury (\\"p\\" - wound, \\"t\\" - corpse), the fifth - sex of the victim, the sixth - the crime scene and year of the crime. According to Ershov, the outcome of all his attacks was surely checked through the media (read newspapers and watched television), and also returned to the scenes of the crime committed by him and watched the operators work from a safe distance. In June 1998, the Siberian Military District Court found him guilty on all counts and sentenced him to death by firing squad. Despite the fact that in accordance with the conclusions of the expert opinion of the Serbsky Center, Ershov \\"suffered from a total delay in psychosexual development...with an anomaly of the sexual attraction of the sadistic circle in the form of a desire to rape and the desire to kill\\", the court recognized him as sane. During the reading of a multi-judge verdict (the criminal case was 43 volumes) Ershov, usually calm, lost consciousness. His lawyer filed a cassation appeal, seeking to mitigate the sentence of his client, but Ershov himself stated that he \\"lost the right to live.\\" On January 28, 1999, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court upheld the verdict without changes. Due to the moratorium on the death penalty announced in the country, the punishment for Vadim Ershov was changed to life imprisonment. He is currently serving his sentence in the Black Dolphin Prison in Sol-Iletsk, Orenburg Oblast.

It was designed by Edward Jeaffreson Jackson and in association with S. G. Thorp and built from 1893 to 1893. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Detail of the Hollowforth gables, pictured in 2012. Hollowforth was completed in 1893 as the home of Professor Richard Threlfall. The house was designed by E. Jefferson Jackson in association with S. G. Thorp. A billiard room with bedroom over was added to the garden front on the eastern elevation by architects Spain and Cosh in 1913 and for the then owner A. H. Way Esq. Sir Richard Threlfall (1861-1932), physicist and chemical engineer, was born on 14 August 1861 at Hollowforth, near Preston, Lancashire, England, the eldest son of Richard Threlfall, a small landholder, wine merchant and sometime mayor of Preston, and his second wife Sarah Jane, née Mason. Threlfall was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, where he shared a study with (Field Marshal Lord) Haig, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.B.A., 1884; M.A., 1888 He also read mathematics privately with W. J. Ibbetson and, midway through his course, studied at the University of Strasbourg under August Kundt and Rudolph Fittig. On graduating with first-class honours in the natural sciences tripos, he lectured at his college and worked as a demonstrator in the Cavendish Laboratory under his friend J. J. Thomson. In 1886 Threlfall was appointed to the chair of physics at the University of Sydney. He was exactly the right person to bring its somewhat moribund teaching into line with the best modern practice, for his training had instilled in him the latest vision of the subject: a body of knowledge expressed in the language of mathematics, but grounded upon laboratory practice characterized by ever-increasing precision of measurement. Despite having lost several fingers while experimenting with explosives, Threlfall was an outstanding manipulator of apparatus whom Thomson regarded as \\"one of the best experimenters I ever met\\". Fired with a passion for research and a determination to create in Sydney a major centre of physical inquiry, immediately upon his arrival Threlfall launched an extensive series of projects using equipment he had bought, without authorization, in Europe. By sheer force of personality, he soon prevailed upon the university and the colonial government to provide him with a splendid new building (completed in 1888) in which to house it. Threlfall's research developed along three separate lines. One, on explosives and the propagation of explosions, led to his being used as a consultant by the local military authorities. Another involved the electrical properties of dielectric materials such as sulphur and selenium. Finally, Threlfall and his student and friend J. A. Pollock developed a quartz thread torsion balance for use as a gravity meter, and then used this to make measurements in a wide range of eastern Australian localities. Through scientific correspondents in Europe and North America, of whom Thomson was by far the most important to him, Threlfall kept abreast of developments in his field. Leaving Australia in 1898, he found a congenial position as director of research with Albright & Wilson, chemical manufacturers, at Oldbury, England. Shortly afterwards he joined their board and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1899. He retained the lease to the land until the department store owner Arthur H. Way, chairman of E. Way & Co. in Pitt Street, acquired the lease in 1908 and bought the freehold title to the land in 1913.  Description  Hollowforth reflects the Art Nouveau influence the theme of which is carried through into the fuild geometric pattern of the shingled wall surfaces. Its roof is a dramatic composition of stepped hips, broken gables, massive brick chimneys and dormer windows with conical caps. The shingled upper walls are bellcast over the lower brick walls supported on a sandstone base. The variety of window forms is typical of the period. The interior contains several fine Art Nouveau features such as leadlighting, tapered stair balusters and joinery details. Prior to its conversion into 2 strata units, the house was being used as 13 flatettes. A dramatic and innovative architectural statement in the shingle style by one of the leading architects of the Federation era, E. Jeaffreson Jackson. Hollowforth joins with a number of Horbury Hunt's commissions to represent the finest examples of this style within the State. The fine landscape setting contributes to the significance of the property. The interior room configuration is significant as is the room size and detailing.LEP, 2013  Heritage listing  Hollowforth was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Hollowforth's architect E. Jefferson Jackson is regarded as a leading architect of the period and the house ranks alongside a number of Horbury Hunt's commissions as the finest examples of the shingle style within the State. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Hollowforth which is both innovative and bold is an outstanding example of the American shingle style displaying further influence by the Art nouveau and Federation Arts and Crafts movement. Situated on a curve within the road, Hollowforth forms an important streetscape element complementing the style of its neighbours.

The Company fabricated diners in the old P. J. Tierney plant after the Tierney company had been liquidated in 1933. Later they added banks, restaurants and other modular buildings to their scope of services. DeRaffele is currently the largest (and one of the oldest) manufacturer of diners. It also now specializes in diner renovations. Westchester County Business Journal, DeRaffele Manufacturing among last of the diner builders by Danielle Brody, May 7, 2015 History Angelo DeRaffele began to work at the Tierney Dining Car Company as a carpenter in 1921.Gutman, Richard, American Diner Then and Now, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (1993) DeRaffele’s friend Joseph FoderoFodero also went on to found his own diner manufacturing company – Fodero Dining Car Company also worked at Tierney’s. DeRaffaele learned the business thoroughly in a short time and rose to the level of foreman. During the Great Depression, there was some significant restructuring at P. J. Tierney, Inc. and by 1933, the company ceased trading and was liquidated. DeRaffaele along with Carl A. Johnson, the former President at Tierney resumed the fabrication of diners at the Tierney plant under the business name of Johnson & DeRaffele.Cultrera, Larry, Classic Diners of Massachusetts, American Palate-Charleston (2011) The company successfully faced and survived challenges like the Great Depression and rationing of materials in World War II. By 1947, DeRaffele owned the Company outright and changed the name to the DeRaffele Manufacturing Company. After the war, the industry boomed. In 1948, Mr. DeRaffele's son Philip joined the business after working there during his high school years. Philip took on all aspects of the company including design. He designed his first diner at age seventeen.Engle, Michael & Monti, Mario, Diners of New York, Stackpole Mechanicsburg (2008) He soon attempted to initiate changes in the company. He tried to convince his father that people were tired of the same small structures that kept coming out of their shop. The subsequent design of the Peter Pan diner, built in the 1950s in Wilmington, DE, transformed the look of diners and helped attract business to the company. The exterior had wings, a bigger canopy and novel window shapes.Westchester County Business Journal, DeRaffele Manufacturing among last of the diner builders by Danielle Brody, May 7, 2015 Al Mac’s Diner (a 1953 DeRaffele) in Fall River, MassachusettsThe business was then headed by the son from 1957 when the elder DeRaffele died. The company is now owned by brothers Joe, Steven and Phil Jr., sons of Philip.Brody, Westchester County Business Journal Business Since the company started keeping track in the 1970s, it has designed, built and renovated more than 650 diners. Today’s company now does about three renovations of existing diners for each new diner that is fabricated.Engle & Monti, Diners of New York The majority of the DeRaffele diners are on the East Coast in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey. The company does not make “simulated diners” – diners built in storefronts or existing buildings. The company works with interior decorators, who assist the prospective diner owner choose a floor, the style of the booths and bars now present in diners and even coordinates the colors in the bathroom. After the design is completed, the staff, including stonecutters, sheet-metal workers, carpenters and welders, will build the project. From start to finish, the process takes about four to five months. After the diners are fabricated, they are taken apart for delivery in sections, transported (by DeRaffele trucks) and reassembled on the site. Approximately 170 DeRaffele Diners are currently operating in 12 states, including Texas, Georgia and South Carolina.Dinerville DeRaffele Diners Among the notable diners are: *Al Mac's Diner-Restaurant – Fall River, MA (1953 DeRaffele) *Ponzio's – Cherry Hill, NJ (DeRaffele 1970s) *Van Dam Diner – Long Island City, NY (1944 DeRaffele) *Penrose Diner - Philadelphia, PA (1963 DeRaffele) *Hilton Head Diner – Hilton Head, SC (1993 DeRaffele) *Hullabaloo Diner – College Station, TX (1950 DeRaffele) References External links Diner manufacturers ","title":"DeRaffele Manufacturing"},{"id":"58424003","text":"The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA; ) is an agency of the Ministry of Communications and Works (Cyprus).

He was a close friend of Bruno Kreisky, with whom he founded the \\"Revolutionäre Sozialistischen\\" (\\"Revolutionary Socialists\\") organisation in February 1934. After Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany in March 1938, both men knew it was only a matter of time before the Gestapo would come for them. Kreisky took an opportunity to flee to Sweden later that same year. Felleis refused to leave. He found work as a road builder which enabled him to change his home frequently and live illegally \\"underground\\" (unknown to the public authorities) so that he might, when he considered the time was right, create and develop cells of party activists. He died on 24 August 1944 as the result of an American bombing raid against Buchenwald concentration camp to where, by this time, he had been taken.  Life  Roman Felleis was born early in the twentieth century to an unmarried sales assistant in Linz. After 1929 he became unemployed, but, in the words of his friend Bruno Kreisky, he \\"remained incessantly active\\" with \\"firm social democratic convictions\\". His career as a political activist began in the Young Socialists (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend\\" / SAJ). After the brief but brutally suppressed insurrection of February 1934 the Young Socialists were banned: three months later a post-democratic government structure emerged in Austria. After the SAJ was declared illegal, on 18 February 1934 a meeting of its former officers took place in the woods west of Vienna. Under the leadership of Roman Felleis and Bruno Kreisky the participants founded the \\"Revolutionäre Sozialistischen\\" (RS / \\"Revolutionary Socialists\\") organisation. Under the one-party \\"Ständestaat\\" structure implemented after February 1934 and incorporated into law in May 1934, the RSJ was by definition illegal. Felleis became a member of its five-man party executive. The Social Democratic Party having been declared illegal by the government in February 1934, a Party Congress was held across the border in Brünn (today Brno) in December 1934. Roman Felleis participated. Back in Austria he was arrested in January 1935 and held in investigative custody. In March 1936 he was one of the most prominent of the 28 defendants in the so- called Socialists' Trial (\\"Sozialistenprozess\\"), which at the time attracted considerable media interest internationally.Manfred Marschalek: Der Wiener Sozialistenprozess 1936. In: Karl R. Stadler (Hrsg.): Sozialistenprozesse, Politische Justiz in Österreich 1870–1936. Europa-Verlag, Wien/München/Zürich 1986, , pp. 429–490. Other high-profile defendants included Bruno Kreisky, Anton Proksch, Franz Jonas and Otto Probst. He received a sixteen-month jail sentence. He was released in June 1936, though it is not entirely clear whether this reflected some form of administrative clemency or simply resulted from the usual procedure which involved offsetting time detained awaiting trial against the appropriate part of the sentence subsequently conferred. On his release he returned to activism with the \\"Revolutionäre Sozialistischen\\". Registration card of Roman Felleis as a prisoner at Buchenwald Nazi Concentration Camp In August 1939 the Gestapo in Vienna performed a round-up of 47 \\"revolutionary socialists\\". Few of them would face a court. Most, including Felleis, were simply taken into \\"protective custody\\" and delivered into the concentration camp network. It seems to have been almost immediately that he was transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar. Here he worked with the (illegal) prisoners' committee. Where possible, he took particular care of Austrian Jewish inmates such as Robert Danneberg, Heinrich Steinitz and Edmund Reismann who were treated even more brutally by the camp authorities than other prisoners. Buchenwald concentration camp was targeted and badly degraded by American bombers on 24 August 1944. A number of the prisoners were killed. Roman Felleis was one of them. His ashes are buried at Feuerhalle Simmering in Vienna.

Member of Parliament In public service, Hunter-Blair was a Deputy Lieutenant for Ayrshire in 1845, before being elected Conservative MP for the county constituency at the 1852 general election and held the seat until his death in 1854. Death Graves of officer who fell at the Battle of Inkerman, including Hunter-Blair'sAn active member of the military, Hunter-Blair was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Scots Fusilier Guards from 1848, and was drafted to fight in the Crimean War, ultimately leading to his death at the Battle of Inkerman in 1854, which caused deep shock and sadness among his parliamentary colleagues. In a letter to Lady Elizabeth Jocelyn—Lady Londonderry and wife of Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry—a few weeks after Blair's death, future prime minister Benjamin Disraeli said: And, in a separate letter to Sarah Brydges Willyams in December 1854, Disraeli described Blair as \\"one of my most active aid-de-camps, & really invaluable both as a partisan & a friend\\", adding his death was a \\"severe loss to me\\". In a later letter to Disraeli, Conservative MP for Petersfield William Jolliffe said: \\"Poor Blair is a sad loss to our party. No one was of greater use to Taylor & I than he was, and on many occasions did excellent service.\\" Meanwhile, James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, stated: \\"Blair cannot be replaced for those who knew & liked him, either as a partisan or friend.\\" References External links * UK MPs 1852–1857 1817 births 1854 deaths Scottish Tory MPs (pre-1912) Deputy Lieutenants of Ayrshire British military personnel killed in the Crimean War British Army personnel of the Crimean War ","title":"James Hunter-Blair (MP)"},{"id":"58424193","text":"Nizhniy Ayryum () is a rural locality (a selo) in Ayryumovskoye Rural Settlement of Giaginsky District, Adygea, Russia.

It was built from 1879 to 1888. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  John Carr of Sydney, ship chandler, sold the property to Edwin Maximilian Dietrich, jeweller, in 1879. The house was built and Dietrich occupied it until 1897. It was owned by William Percy Maschwitz from 1897 to 1906, and by C. W. Gaden from 1906. Additions including the terrazzo verandah floor with its swastika and coat of arms were probably made by Dietrich in the 1890s, as the coat of arms resembles a Dietrich coat of arms shown in Planches de l'armorial generale de J B Reitstap. There is some slight evidence that the work may have been by architect David McBeath. There is no evidence that the building was ever a German Consulate.Research by W Chapman, March 1985 Don Bradman, renowned Australian cricketer lived at Ildemere from 1932–1934. The Bradman family rented the downstairs area of the house from the Allan family who were the owners at that time.LEP, 2013.  Description  =House ()= Fine example of Victorian waterfront mansion with individual details of particular interest. Important as the last of the type along this foreshore especially as its waterfront and boatshed are intact. Significant garden. Associated with prominent Sydney jeweller and resident. Visually prominent from the water which is its dominant aspect. This building is designed in the Victorian Filligree style. Architectural evidence suggests an 1880s house with Federation period extensions. A two-storey brick building, rendered to imitate ashlar on the main (east) side; colonial bond painted brick with boxed eaves on north side; two-storey south section of Edwardian character of stretcher bond painted brick with exposed rafters. Complex iron roof and corbelled brick chimneys. Windows variously round-arched and double hung, or casement; south side has a large Edwardian round-arched window. Facetted bay front on the eastern side. two-storey verandah to front and side with cast iron posts, balustrade, brackets and valances, has a terrazzo floor in which are inlaid a swastika, a German coat of arms, and the name Ildemere in front of the front door. The house has an excellent mature terraced garden and a two-storey weatherboard boatshed (shown in a 1911 photo). =Boat House (1888)= One of the few surviving waterfront boathouses of the nineteenth century which besides being relatively intact, is also still part of its original property and generally retains its context. Two storey weatherboard building with corrugated-iron gable roof. It sits on the waters edge above a sandstone seawall and has been modified for residential use by the insertion of windows to the end elevation, with upper floor balcony carried on diagonal struts. The ground floor waters edge door has been modified by the insertion of full length doors but the fixtures for a pontoon ramp remain on the base timber beam. = Modifications and dates = Major alterations - sympathetic/ weatherboard boatshed has been altered, including the addition of windows in the north side. There is also a smaller boatshed of fibro and corrugated iron, probably built to cover a pre-existing slipway. = Further information = Boat House built as extension of and in relation to the house, and retains this relationship.

It is named after the Türkengraben (Turkish moat) to which it ran. In the list of historical monuments in Munich, more than 30 objects are listed in the Türkenstraße.  Location  The 1.3 km long Türkenstraße runs from the Brienner Straße in a northeasterly direction and ends at the border of the district Schwabing, in the Georgenstraße.  History  The approval of the street name in 1812 by royal rescript of Max I. is the first nomination as Türkenstraße. In 1823, the Türkenkaserne (Turkish barracks) were built on the area between Barer, Gabelsberger, Türkenstraße and Theresienstraße. Infantry regiments were initially stationed here, so the barracks was used by the Bavarian State Police after the First World War, which gave way during the Drittes Reich of the Wehrmacht. After civilian use in the post-war period, the barracks were demolished in the 1960s. All that remains today is the historically protected Türkentor. On the site today are various museums, including the Pinakothek der Moderne, and university institutes located. As of 1848, on the corner of Brienner Straße stood the Wittelsbacher Palais. Originally built as a Crown Prince's Palace for Max I, however, immediately after its completion it became the retirement seat of Ludwig I and later the residence of Ludwig III. After a varied history as a meeting place for the Soviet Republic and Gestapo headquarters, it was destroyed by a bombing in 1944. In 1964, the remaining ruins were removed and the Bayerische Landesbank was built on its location. In 1874, August von Voit set up a simultan school, where boys and girls of different faiths were equally received. After severe damage in the Second World War, the school was renovated several times and received its present appearance in the 1950s. Today, in the building with the number 68, is a primary school with a Schülerhort (daycare) and after school program, as well as a municipal kindergarten. The square next to the school was named after Georg Elser. In 1903, Kathi Kobus opened the cabaret restaurant Simplicissimus in the premises of the former Crown Prince Rudolf. Karl Valentin appeared regularly there in 1907, other regular guests included Frank Wedekind, Ludwig Thoma, Thomas Theodor Heine and Julius Beck. Erich Mühsam and Joachim Ringelnatz were so-called house poets and until the destruction in 1944, the Simplicissimus was a central starting point for the Munich, in particular the Schwabinger, cultural scene. Today, the Turkenstraße is located next to many restaurants, the Museum Brandhorst and a police inspection office.  Historical monuments on Türkenstraße  Historically significant protected monuments on the Türkenstraße are, for example, the Palais Dürckheim (a former aristocratic palace and later Prussian legation), the Türkentor (entrance gate of the former Turkish barracks) or the Old Simpl. In addition, there are numerous rental buildings from the 19th century, which were designed in neo-barock or neo-Renaissance styles.

In 1923, the group called its first national convention, at which delegates from six other Ohio colleges attended and were granted charters. Also at this meeting, the group changed its name to Alpha Phi Gamma due to another fraternity being called Phi Alpha Gamma and initiated its first female member. The fraternity merged with Omega Xi Alpha, a similar California group, in 1929 which became Alpha Phi Gamma's western section. After activity came to a standstill during World War II, Gil A. Cowan of the Los Angeles Examiner was responsible for its revival and post war growth. In 1949, Cowan was named President Emeritus, a unique honor to the organization.

A file on Tarella held in the North Sydney Stanton Library Local History Unit has a photograph taken in 1899 that does not show the two Canary Island date palms. These appear to have been planted in the early 20th century,Turnbull Group, 1993 a species that was popularised by Joseph Maiden, after he planted a triple avenue of these palms along Macquarie Street in the 1910s.Stuart Read, 24 February 2016 Tarella was fully restored by the early 1970s. It was furnished appropriately. It has two plaques, donated by the owner and AMP Society. The house has good coloured glass and beautiful iron lace. Front lawns and garden, with fountain and iron gates (relocated) from the historic St John's Anglican Church, Parramatta.AHC, date not given. In 1982 the then owner John Hawkins sought North Sydney Council approval of a rezoning proposal to allow the house to be used as professional offices by architects Edwards, Madigan, Torzillo and Briggs. Hawkins who had restored the property was keen that it be retained, and if this use was the key was supportive. North Sydney Council opposed any rezoning, citing concerns at gradual loss of its residential areas particularly sites such as this. Hawkins threatened to lodge a development application to demolish the house if rezoning were not approved. The Heritage Council considered the rezoning proposal and the request for an order under the Heritage Act. It decided that while it was aware of North Sydney Council's policy aimed at preventing further alienation of residential land in the municipality, it considered that the building is of such heritage significance that it would support proposals to rezone the site for uses compatible with the heritage significance of the building and which would ensure its retention and maintenance. Further it advised that in the event that it was advised of proposed demolition of the building, the Heritage Council would consider recommending its protection under the NSW Heritage Act.Branch Manager's Report, 5 October 1982 The property, now empty, was bought in 2001 by Simply Technology and is leased to the childcare centre company, Brenham P/L. Brenham P/L in 2015 proposed a childcare centre for 80 children at Tarella, to operate five days a week. The company operates two childcare centres in Sydney. North Sydney City Council's Independent Planning Panel refused a development application for this use in April 2015 on several grounds. The Heritage Council also refused an integrated development application due to adverse impacts on heritage significance, fabric and setting. An appeal was lodged with the NSW Land and Environment Court.McCullagh, 2015 A childcare centre use was subsequently approved by NSW Land and Environment Court.McCullagh, 14 July 2016, 8  Description  The clocktower on the coachhouse, pictured in 2015. The coachhouse, pictured in 2015. =Grounds= The house is set well-back from the street frontage on a large site, with a serpentine drive through extensive lawn area, framed by trees and shrub plantings. There is a large semi-formal garden between the painted iron palisade fence on the Amherst Street boundary and the house. The garden features two mature Canary Island date (Phoenix canariensis) and Alexandra (Archontophoenix alexandrae) palms, Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), lavender hedges, roses, pomegranate (Punica granatum) and frangipani (Plumeria rubra cv.) trees with a fountain and pond in the lawn.NTAStuart Read, 16 June 2014 An ornamental cast iron fence marks the street front.McCullagh, 2016 The date of much of the garden fabric may be early 20th century. An 1899 photograph held in the North Sydney Stanton Library shows no Canary Island date palms, suggesting they date to the early 20th century (NB: this species was popularised by Joseph Maiden after he planted a triple avenue of it along Macquarie Street. The garden contains species not authentic to the Victorian era. The concrete path is not part of the original landscape.Turnbull Group, 1993, 4 The pond, fountain and relocated iron gates appear to date from later in the twentieth century, possibly during the Hawkins ownership era.

Early life and education  Florence Ayscough, née Wheelock, was born between 1875 and 1878 in Shanghai, China, to Canadian father Thomas Reed Wheelock and American mother Edith H. Clarke. At that time Canada was under British rule, so because Ayscough's father was Canadian she was a China-born Briton. Ayscough moved to the United States of America aged nine, and attended Shaw School in Brookline, Massachusetts near Boston. It was at the school that she met Amy Lowell, the American poet, the two of whom were lifelong friends. Ayscough's family returned to live in China when she was in her early twenties. She was a student of Chinese Art, Literature, and Sociology.  Career  Ayscough was a lecturer on Chinese art and literature and was the author of eight books on Chinese history, culture, literary criticism and translation. She traveled as a lecturer to cities including London, Paris, Berlin and New York. Ayscough accepted a permanent lecturing post at the University of Chicago in 1938, where she lectured on Chinese literature and continued her translation work and documenting the history and culture of China. She was Honorary Librarian of the North China Branch Royal Asiatic Society in Shanghai for fifteen years. She collected modern Chinese paintings, including work by Xugu. Her efforts introduced this Chinese art form to the American public. Her writings included translations of classical poetry and essays on Chinese art, history, and philosophy. She work also attempted to correct previous inaccurate attempts to translate the cultures of ancient and contemporary China, for example perspectives of China as a stagnant culture. In addition to countering negative stereotypes with positive reevaluations, she also sought to correct misinformation. For example, her review of the 1931 novel The Good Earth by American writer Pearl Buck, Ayscough praised the choice of contemporary Chinese peasantry as the subject, but criticized the accuracy. Ayscough had a strong influence on the work of her friend Amy Lowell, being the source of Lowell's interest in Asian culture and Chinese poetry. Ayscough introduced Lowell to Chinese paintings and poetry in 1917. On a visit to America, she brought with her Chinese word pictures that she translated into English, which Lowell turned into rhymed poetry. = Publications = Her first book, Fir- Flower Tablets, with Amy Lowell, was a translation of poems from the Chinese. A Chinese Mirror, published in 1925, was an analysis of the structure of Chinese society government, in particular the symbolism of the Beijing imperial palaces. She published Tu Fu, the Autobiography of a Chinese Poet in 1932; her translations of the poems of Tu Fu, with a biography constructed using his poetry. In 1934 she published Travels of a Chinese Poet. These two works contributed to the introduction of Tu Fu to the British public. Ayscough wrote two books intended for younger readers; The Autobiography of a Chinese Dog, an account of Shanghai from the perspective of her Pekingese dog Yo-fei, and Fire-Cracker Land. Her final work, Chinese Women Yesterday and To-day, published in 1937, examined contemporary Chinese women leaders as successors of a long line of capable, though secluded, Chinese women. Ayscough also contributed articles to The Encyclopaedia Sinica.  Personal life  Ayscough's first husband was British importer Francis Ayscough, whom she met after moving back to Shanghai, China. As a young bride in Shanghai, she decided to learn to speak and read Mandarin. Her husband died in 1933 after a long illness. Following his death she dedicated a stained glass window at the church in Cradley, Herefordshire to him and his parents. Ayscough married her second husband, sinologist Harley Farnsworth MacNair, in 1935. Ayscough named their homes in Chicago in traditional Chinese fashion; 'Wild Goose Happiness House', and 'House of the Wutung Trees' after the painting by Ren Yi in their collection. Ayscough enjoyed sailing, swimming, theatre and music, and was a member of the English Speaking Union. As a child she developed an interest in horses and developed into a capable horsewoman. In addition to Mandarin, she spoke fluent French and German. In 1941, Ayscough was admitted to the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital, where she died on 26 April 1942 after a long illness. Her memorial service was held at Chicago's First Unitarian Church, conducted by Dr. Von Ogden Vogt. She was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. = Legacy = After her death, Ayscough's correspondence with her friend, the poet Amy Lowell, was compiled and published by her husband Professor Harley Farnsworth MacNair. The following year he published a biography of his wife titled The Incomparable Lady. He donated her collection of 1,292 Chinese language books to the Library of Congress.

Such references cite \\"The house that brains built\\", an article in \\"Building\\" magazine on 12 February 1912. However, this article clearly refers to the home of George Augustine Taylor (and his wife, Florence Mary Taylor), the publishers of \\"Building\\", which was located next door, at 6 Bannerman St. This house (which no longer exists) was also designed by HA Wilshire, and was very similar looking to Dalkeith, though with a flat roof. with terracotta finials and ridge saddles, a typical treatment at the time.Archnex, 2016, 12 & 4 It is a two storey house of rusticated ashlar sandstone with extensive use of timber shingle cladding to the upper storey. The multi-hipped roof is clad in slate with terracotta ridge capping. Features include the sheet metal verandah balustrade with decorative relief castings, rendered flat rain hoods over window and door openings and roughcast rendered entrance porch. This building is designed in the Federation Arts and Crafts style. An interesting example of a Federation Arts and Crafts style house which is representative of the type of residences which typified the early development in the area. Associational value for its use a chapel for the Norwegian Seaman's church. Excellent survival of context. It remains a significant local landmark. The billiard room was designed in 1914 by Stone & Siddeley and built in 1916. Rough cast plaster over masonry, flat roofed (with iron pipe balustrading).Archnex, 2016, 3, 6 The original inglenook fireplace and stained glass windows were reinstated in 2018. The original house was extended to the rear in 1923 (DA North Sydney council) to create a side, rear entrance and large reception rooms on the main level. Wood panelling and parquetry floors were added at this time. =Outbuildings= A double garage is on one side of the house accessed off Bannerman Street. The original workshop (1908) was reconfigured as a cottage (two rooms: living/dining and bedroom, with open plan kitchen in living/dining area and bathroom/WC in bedroom area) by the Sjomannskirken and is documented by a DA drawing. The 1914 blueprint for the billiard room shows a \\"chimney to rise thro [sic] workshop\\", with \\"rough cast above workshop roof\\". The cottage roof was shallowly pitched and slate, with terracotta ridge tiles to hip and skillion roof. Walls were sandstone to front (downhill), and lightweight framing clad in \\"fibro\\" cladding to the extension the rear (uphill). tongue-and-groove lining boards to the ceiling in the living/dining space. The bedroom had internal wall / ceiling linings of vertical boards (walls), hardboard and boarding.Archnex, 2016, 6 The building was reconfigured in 2018 for use as a pool house (Nth Sydney council DA 468/16). The external sandstone structure of the original building was maintained. =Garden= The house is set well back from the street, on a sloping site terraced with rock walling, and accessed by concrete paths and steps. A spacious lawn occupies the lowest terrace level adjoining the street edge. A low stone wall with iron gate (and historic plaque on one pillar), and hedge of Viburnum odoratissimum marks the front boundary. Another similar murraya hedge lines the upper terrace on which the house sits.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 2 May 2016 The garden was replanted with heritage plants and natives between 2015 and 2018 after years of neglect. All Cocos Island or Queen palms (Syragus romanzoffianum) and the silver date (Phoenix sylvestris) were removed in 2015. A handful of pre- existing plants survived including a prominent Sydney blue gum on the lower level, a mature cycad on the mid level and several camellias (japonica and sasanqua). Shrubs now include sweet pittosporum (P.undulatum) and angels trumpet (Brugmansia) in the front garden bordering the upper (house) terrace. A white-painted flag pole runs an Australian flag in the front yard. = Modifications and dates = 2011: unapproved works undertaken: demolition of rear portion of the house; rendering of small outbuilding to rear; installing new roofing on this building. 2016 modifications to rear of property as approved in DA 468/16 were completed.

It is a rental charge based on the gross income of the tenant rather than a fixed monthly or annual value. In most examples, the percent rent only applies after a certain amount of base rent has been paid. The amount where the percentage rent begins to apply is known as the breakpoint. Some leases may be purely percent based and have no base component, but such cases are not common. Percent rent is normally considered an additional rent term. For example, if a tenant has a base rent of $1,000 per month, and a percentage rent of 5% of income on an annualized basis, then the natural breakpoint is (12 x 1,000) / 5% = $240,000. That means the tenant will pay only base rent until they have an annual income greater than $240,000, although they may agree to some other breakpoint value as part of the lease negotiation. If their income surpasses the breakpoint, the percent rent is only the portion that has not already paid. In this example, if the tenant were to have an annual income of $260,000, they would owe (260,000 - 240,000) x 5% = $1000 percent rent, and thus their total rent for the year would be $12,000 + $1000 = $13,000. Percent rent is common in retail settings, where the month-to-month income is highly variable and many tenants may make the majority of their income in the one or two months around the holiday shopping season. In these cases, the landlord can offer a lease with a base rent that is far below fair market value, but still within the tenant's capabilities to pay during the \\"lean times\\". Any potential losses are then made up with the percentage term. This often appeals to the tenant, as it means their rent scales with their own success. Percent rent may also be used for new tenants whose business are just being set up. In this case, the tenant may need a very large space, like a warehouse or factory, but does not expect to see profits for an extended period of time. In these examples, it is common to have several breakpoints with a reduced percentage as sales increase, say 5% for the first million in sales, 4% for sales between 1 and 10 million, and then 3% for all sales over 10 million.
