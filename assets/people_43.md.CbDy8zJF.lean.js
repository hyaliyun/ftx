Additionall, he played first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team, as well as winning the prestigious Hurlingham Club Championship in polo. Life and military career Sanger was born at Reading and was educated at Cheltenham College.

He made his living doing portrait work while becoming known as a major member of the International Modernist photography movement in Canada. He was a key figure in Vancouver's artistic community. Personal life and early career Born Jan van der Pant on January 11, 1884, Vanderpant grew up in Alkmaar. Although expected to take over his father‚Äôs tobacconist business, Vanderpant developed artistic passions especially those related to music and literature. From 1905 to 1912, he studied at the University of Amsterdam and Leiden University. He also published a few poems in Dutch literary journals and in 1908 published his only book of poetry, Verzen [Verses]. His short story, Haar Verdriet was published in 1908 and in January of that year the journal Nederland in Riip published Vanderpant‚Äôs first photograph: a winter image. In 1910, while still registered with the University of Leiden, Vanderpant started working as a photojournalist for the magazine Op de Hoogte [Well Informed]. Until 1913, he published photo-illustrated articles on Italy, Portugal, Holland, and Canada. On July 6, 1911, Vanderpant married Catharina over de Linden. She eventually became a Christian Scientist and her beliefs were a major influence on her husband. They immigrated to Canada in 1911, and Vanderpant published several articles in Dutch newspapers and magazines on Canada as a possible new homeland for Dutch farmers. In 1912, the Canadian government hired Vanderpant to lecture to Dutch audiences on Canadian immigration. Vanderpant and Catharina settled in Okotoks, Alberta, in 1912 where he opened a photographic studio. In 1916, they moved to Fort Macleod and opened another studio while maintaining the one in Okotoks. Eventually, he opened a third studio in Pincher Creek. In 1913, the Vanderpants had three children between 1913 and 1917: Anna (1913), John (1915) and Catharina (1917). John died from influenza while still an infant. In 1919, John and Catharina Vanderpant and their two daughters relocated to British Columbia. They settled in New Westminster, where Vanderpant operated a successful portrait business.

In 1921, Vanderpant befriended the Victoria pictorialist, Harry Upperton Knight. The two men visited Emily Carr in 1933 and Knight photographed Carr and Vanderpant in her studio. In 1924, Vanderpant met and befriended the restaurateur and amateur photographer, Johan Helders. Both used a silver bromide printing process and Kodak paper, P.M.C. No. 8. Little of Helders‚Äô work survives, but a portrait of Yousef Karsh is among his most known prints.Erroll, Constance, ‚ÄúLens Revelations. The Story of a Camera Artist Who is Revealing the Spirit of Canada,‚Äù MacLean‚Äôs Magazine, vol. 40 (1 January1927): 11. Vanderpant became an active participant in international salons, winning several awards, certificates, and medals. His work conveyed the arresting effects of light and shadow, textures, and compositions. In 1920, he founded the New Westminster Photographic Salon as part of the Fine Arts Gallery of the British Columbia Annual Provincial Exhibition. At one point, that salon exhibited 1,400 prints from 23 countries. From 1923 to 1929, Vanderpant hosted the New Westminster Salon of Pictorial Photography (the only international salon in Western Canada during the 1920s). In addition, he promoted the exhibitions of art by B.C. and Canadian artists, including the now famous Group of Seven. Vanderpant eventually became disillusioned with photographic salons and ended his participation. In 1924, the San Francisco Museum of Art purchased Vanderpant‚Äôs print Window Patterns. The next year, he had a one-man show of his prints at the Royal Photographic Society in London, England. From 1925 to 1934, solo exhibitions of his work toured Canada, the United States, and Europe. In 1926, Vanderpant went into partnership with Harold Mortimer Lamb (a mining engineer, photographer, painter and journalist) and on March 26, 1928, they opened the Vanderpant Galleries at 1216 Robson Street in Vancouver, BC (the partnership ended in 1929). Under Vanderpant‚Äôs influence, the gallery became a centre of art, music, and poetry in Vancouver. Members of the Vancouver Poetry Society often held meetings and readings at the Galleries as well as several galas; students from the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts, the BC College of Arts, and the music faculty from the University of British Columbia attended musical evenings to listen to imported symphonic music played on Vanderpant‚Äôs Columbia gramophone. Painters such as Emily Carr, A. Y. Jackson, Jock Macdonald, Max Maynard, Frederick Varley, and W. P. Weston exhibited at the Galleries. Moreover, in 1931, Vanderpant exhibited what is likely the first Canadian showing of prints by the American photographers Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston. Both appreciated Vanderpant‚Äôs photography, and Weston stated that Vanderpant‚Äôs work had ‚Äúimagination, form, -- vitality.‚ÄùLetter from Edward Weston to John Vanderpant, 8 May 1931, quoted in Sheryl Salloum‚Äôs Underlying Vibrations: The Photography and Life of John Vanderpant, 27. Three Sisters (1920s-1930s). Silver bromide print. From the Art Gallery of Ontario collection. While Vanderpant started as a pictorialist, his work moved from soft focus and romanticized images to more modernist compositions. However, he was never adverse to dodging, cropping, or enlarging; nor did he totally abandon soft focus. During the mid-1920s he began photographing grain elevators with his 6 ¬Ω x 9 cm. Ansco camera with an f/63 anastigmatic lens. In 1929, he toured Central Canada and had a solo exhibition at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto and one at the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa. His photography became more experimental and modernist. In 1930, he undertook a commission for the Canadian Pacific Railway, traveling from Vancouver to Quebec. In 1932, Vanderpant had a solo exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery that demonstrated his fascination with the beauty found in everyday items such as wrapping paper, light bulbs, stacks of dishes or books, or blocks of wood. Since the 1920s, Vanderpant‚Äôs images of grain elevators have uniquely represented ‚ÄúCanadian industrial architecture.‚ÄùDonegan, Rosemary, ‚ÄúIndustrial Images,‚Äù (Hamilton‚Äù Art Gallery of Hamilton, 1987), 96. Close-ups of fruits and vegetables were also a way ‚Äúto emphasize the rhythm and beauty of design in . . . nature‚Äôs architecture.‚ÄùVanderpant, John, unpublished writings quoted in Salloum‚Äôs Underlying Vibrations, 51. The economic difficulties of the Depression affected Vanderpant's business and health, and he ceased making photographs around 1937. Vanderpant died of lung-cancer in Vancouver in 1939, at age fifty-five, leaving behind his studio and an extensive legacy of work. Recognition In 1926, Vanderpant was honoured by being named a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain, in London. In 1934, he was the first Vancouver artist to have an individual showing at the Seattle Art Museum. The Vancouver Art Gallery held displays of his prints in 1932 and 1937 and a retrospective in 1940. In 1976 the National Gallery of Canada sponsored an exhibition of his work that travelled across the country. Vanderpant‚Äôs work is now in the collections of Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa; the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario; Toronto; Leiden University, The Netherlands; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; the New Westminister Historic Centre and Museum, New Westminister, BC; the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; and the Vancouver Art Gallery.

In the same period, Jesuit priests came to the region and founded the first village. Forte do Pr√≠ncipe da Beira, 1930. As a consequence of the discovery of gold on the right bank of the Guapor√© River, the Portuguese Crown founded the Captaincy of Mato Grosso in 1748 with :pt:Antonio Rolim de Moura Tavares as governor.

In 1753, he installed a surveillance post in the village of Santa Rosa Velha, built by the Spanish on the right bank of the Guapor√©, and thus in Brazilian lands. In 1759, the Spanish governor of Santa Cruz de la Sierra requested that the post be evacuated. Instead, Rolim de Moura built a fort to replace it, which became known as the Pres√≠dio de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o. Due to the climate and the incursions of the Spanish, the Presidio was soon in ruins. It was rebuilt in 1769 by Governor Lu√≠s Pinto de Sousa Coutinho, and renamed as :pt:Forte de Bragan√ßa. Ruined again, in 1776 the Forte Pr√≠ncipe da Beira was built in its place. In 1772, Francisco de Melo Palheta led an expedition from Bel√©m which reached the Madeira River, the Mamor√© River and the Guapor√© River, reaching Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The decline of mining and the proclamation of the First Brazilian Republic caused the region to lose its economic importance until the end of the nineteenth century, when the exploitation of rubber entered its peak. Postcolonial history In April 1878, following to the Treaty of Ayacucho, the border between Bolivia and Brazil was mapped by cartographic teams and agreed in 1879. The Treaty of Petr√≥polis in 1903 led to the construction of the Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad, leading to increased settlement. Decree-Law No. 5812 (13 of September 1943) established the Federal Territory of Guapor√© was created from parts of the states of Amazonas and Mato Grosso. By the law of February 17 1956, the region became known as the Federal Territory of Rond√¥nia, in honor of Marshal C√¢ndido Rondon. The exploitation of brazil nuts and rubber was the main economic activity until the discovery of cassiterite deposits, which accelerated the development and settlement of the region. This development led to the territory achieving the status of a state in 1982, with 13 constituent municipalities, including the capital, Porto Velho.

Ridenbaugh, completed the project in 1878, and the ditch became known as the Ridenbaugh Canal. Settlers established farms in the area of the Morris Ranch, later named the Ridenbaugh Ranch, after completion of the canal. In the 1880s Benjamin Scott purchased the Ridenbaugh Ranch, and he donated land for construction of a one room school at the corner of Franklin and Orchard Roads. Scott School was part of the community of Franklin, about three miles west of Boise City,The Franklin community should not be confused with the town of Franklin, Idaho, founded in 1860.

Opened in 1972, and owned by Suntory, it is currently the only major whisky distillery in Japan specialising in grain whisky. It is one of three domestic whisky distilleries owned by Suntory, the others being Yamazaki and Hakushu. Until 2015, the Chita distillery produced grain whisky to be blended with malt whisky produced at the other distilleries. Recognition of the Chita distillery's contribution to the increasing quality of Japanese blended whiskies led Suntory to commission a flagship single grain whisky \\"The Chita\\".  Styles of whisky  Three types of whisky are produced at the Chita distillery, all of which are primarily derived from corn. The first two are blended whisky components, and are blended in to Suntory's domestic market Kakubin and Suntory Old as well as high-end Hibiki respectively. The third and most recent whisky is the distillery's flagship single grain \\"Chita\\". When the Chita distillery was commissioned by Suntory to create a Japanese single grain whisky, Suntory's fifth-generation chief blender Fukuyo Shinji was brought in to select the grain combinations. He settled on a blend of 10 grain types that together exuded a plum-like sweetness. For ageing, Fukuyo selected sherry, bourbon and wine barrels of white oak and Spanish oak. Currently, only one variant of Chita is currently sold. It is bottled in 700ml (domestic and international sales) and 180ml (limited to convenience stores mainly in the Ch≈´bu region).

Heavy metal musician Dimebag Darrell, the main target of the attack, was on stage with his band Damageplan when the shooting took place. The perpetrator, 25-year-old Nathan Gale, was shot and killed by police officer James Niggemeyer while holding a wounded victim hostage. Dimebag Darrell, real name Darrell Abbott, sustained multiple gunshots to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. Damageplan's head of security, Jeffrey \\"Mayhem\\" Thompson, tackled Gale and was fatally shot in the ensuing struggle. A fan, Nathan Bray, who attempted to aid Abbott and Thompson, was also murdered, as was Erin Halk, an employee of the nightclub who tried to disarm Gale as he was reloading. Gale was enlisted in the United States Marine Corps from February 2002 until he was discharged in October 2003. The reason for the discharge was not disclosed by the Marines, although Gale told his mother and a former employer that he had received a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia prior to his discharge. A fan of Abbott's previous band Pantera, Gale's friends reported that he believed Pantera had stolen his lyrics and that its members were attempting to steal his identity. Background Darrell Lance Abbott, best known by his stage name Dimebag Darrell, was the co-founder and guitarist of the heavy metal band Pantera, which was active from 1981 to 2003. After Pantera's acrimonious split, Abbott co-founded Damageplan, which released its debut album, New Found Power, in February 2004. The band spent most of the year on tour. On April 5, 2004, eight months prior to the shooting, Nathan Gale ran onto the stage during a Damageplan performance at Bogart's nightclub in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was unarmed and was stopped by the venue's security before reaching the band members. Gale refused to leave the stage and toppled a lighting rig as the security guards removed him from the venue, causing $2,000 worth of damage. Damageplan vocalist Patrick Lachman joked about the incident later in the performance, and the band declined to press charges against Gale as they did not want to return to Cincinnati for court hearings. Shooting On December 8, 2004, Alrosa Villa, a nightclub in Columbus, Ohio, held a concert headlined by Damageplan. Around 250 people attended the show at the 600-capacity venue. As the opening acts played their sets, Gale paced outside the club. When asked by an attendee why he would not come into the club, Gale said he did not want to \\"see no shitty local bands\\", and that he was \\"gonna wait for Damageplan\\". Alrosa Villa's manager believed him to be a loiterer who did not have a ticket; one of the club's employees told him to leave. After Damageplan went on stage at around EST, Gale climbed over a fence and entered the club through a side door. As Damageplan played the first song of its setlist, \\"Breathing New Life\\", Gale rushed onto the stage and drew his Beretta 92FS, a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. He moved directly towards Abbott and shot him four times at point-blank range: once in the right cheek, the left ear, the back of the head, and the right hand. Some of the attendees initially thought the incident was a part of the act; a security guard recalled: \\"People were pumping their fists, thinking it was a hoax.\\" Damageplan's tour manager Chris Paluska was shot once in the chest before the band's head of security, Jeffrey \\"Mayhem\\" Thompson, tackled Gale. Thompson was shot in the chest, back and thigh in the ensuing struggle. A fan, Nathan Bray, who climbed onto the stage to attempt to assist Abbott and Thompson, was shot in the chest, and Erin Halk, an Alrosa Villa employee who approached Gale from behind and tried to disarm him as he was reloading, was shot six times: four times in the chest, and once in the hand and the leg. Damageplan's drum technician John \\"Kat\\" Brooks then attempted to subdue Gale. He was shot twice in the leg and taken as a hostage. Responding within three minutes to a dispatch call, police officer James Niggemeyer entered the club through a door behind the stage and shot Gale once in the head with a 12-gauge Remington Model 870 shotgun, killing him. At the time of his death, Gale had a half-full magazine in his Beretta and another 30 rounds of ammunition on his person. Fans performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Abbott until paramedics arrived at the scene, where he was pronounced dead, aged 38. Thompson, 40, and Halk, 29, also were pronounced dead at the scene, while Bray, 23, was declared dead at the Riverside Methodist Hospital at Paluska and Brooks both were transported to the Riverside Methodist Hospital, where they recovered from their injuries. Travis Burnett, a member of one of the opening acts' road crew, was grazed in the arm by a bullet and received treatment at the scene, but was not hospitalized. Perpetrator Nathan Gale (September 11, 1979 ‚Äì December 8, 2004) was from Marysville, Ohio. He attended Benjamin Logan High School before transferring to Marysville High School during his junior year. He took his classes at the Ohio Hi-Point Joint Vocational School, studying construction and electrical work, and graduated in 1998. Afterwards, he developed a drug addiction and occasionally worked minimum-wage jobs. During this time, he lived with his mother, Mary Clark, and made complaints that he was being watched, which she attributed to his drug use. After a violent altercation, she evicted him and he became homeless. Clark allowed Gale to return after he agreed to undergo drug rehabilitation. In February 2002, Gale enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Clark was proud of her son's military service, and felt that he had successfully recovered from his drug problems. As a Christmas present in 2002, she bought him the gun that he would later use in the shooting. Gale was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina with the 2nd Marine Division until October 2003, when he was discharged. A spokesperson for the Marines declined to reveal the reasoning for Gale's discharge, citing privacy rules. Clark stated after the shooting that Gale had told her he was discharged due to a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. After his discharge, the Department of Veteran Affairs secured a job for Gale as a mechanic. His employer, Rich Cencula, later reported that Gale had also told him he was schizophrenic. Clark believed that Gale was not taking medication for the illness; an autopsy performed by the Franklin County coroner's office found that no drugs were in Gale's system. At and over , Gale was an offensive lineman for the semi-professional Lima Thunder football team; he listened to Pantera before games to prepare himself psychologically. He had been a fan of Pantera since high school, and retained a fixation with the band after its disbandment in 2003. Dave Johnson, a former friend, stated that Gale once requested to practice songs, which he claimed to have written, with Johnson's band. When one of Johnson's bandmates noted the lyrics were copied from Pantera, Gale said Pantera had stolen his lyrics and he was planning to sue the band. Gale also claimed that the members of Pantera were attempting to steal his identity. Another former friend, Mark Break, said that Gale \\"was obsessed with Pantera\\". Johnson reported that he distanced himself from Gale several months before the shooting due to Gale's strange behavior, which included talking to himself and interacting with an imaginary dog. Break reported that he observed the same behavior. Gale had a criminal record and was known to local police, though none of his crimes were violent. He was cited for criminal trespassing in 1997, for skateboarding at a Kmart, and in 1999, for repeatedly sleeping in a public park. In 2000, Gale was charged with receiving stolen property in relation to the theft of a set of scales from a construction company that employed him, and was fired. On November 17, 2004, he was arrested for driving with a suspended license. At the time of the shooting, Gale was a construction worker and lived alone in an apartment in Marysville. Handwritten notes were discovered by police in his apartment after the shooting. One of the notes stated: \\"You'll see come alive. I'll take your life and make it mine. This is my life I'm gone. Git me.\\" Aftermath Initial reports claimed that Gale had shouted, \\"You broke up Pantera\\" or, \\"This is for breaking up Pantera\\" before he shot Abbott, but these claims were never corroborated by Alrosa Villa attendees. A Metal Hammer interview with former Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo published shortly before the shooting was also initially listed as a possible motivation. In the interview, Anselmo said Abbott \\"deserves to be beaten severely\\". A police investigation found no evidence that the shooting was motivated by Pantera's split or by the dispute between Anselmo and Abbott, and investigators were unable to find evidence that Gale had read the interview. The fact that the shooting took place exactly 24 years after the murder of John Lennon was also deemed coincidental. Abbott's brother and bandmate Vinnie Paul later requested to listen to the audio recording of the Metal Hammer interview, and concluded that Anselmo was not joking, as he had stated, when he made the \\"beaten severely\\" comment. Vinnie refused to speak to Anselmo after that point. In a 2017 interview, former Pantera bassist Rex Brown stated that Vinnie would not speak to him or Anselmo, and gave this as a reason why a Pantera reunion did not materialize. A grand jury convened to evaluate the actions of responding officer Niggemeyer, a standard procedure for cases involving the use of deadly force by a police officer. In May 2005, the grand jury cleared him of any wrongdoing. Niggemeyer was praised for his actions: he was nominated for a bravery award organized by America's Most Wanted, received the Distinguished Law Enforcement Valor Award from Ohio attorney general Jim Petro, and was named the Law Enforcement Officer of the Year in 2005 by the National Rifle Association. Gale's mother said of him: \\"I give that man credit. You'll never know how many lives he saved.\\" Niggemeyer retired as a first responder three years after the shooting on the recommendation of doctors, as he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He was transferred to the robbery division as a detective, before leaving the police force entirely. As of 2016, he is working in Columbus's fleet management division and is still receiving therapy from a psychologist due to the shooting. The shooting led to debate regarding the security at music venues. Scott Ian of Anthrax said: \\"To me, everything changed after [Abbott] was killed. The stage became off-limits for everyone but musicians. I don't give a fuck how much fun you're having. Stay the fuck off the stage.\\" Paul Mazurkiewicz of Cannibal Corpse said in 2014: \\"I remember us being fully concerned about it. There was beefed-up security and a little bit more patting down. But it seems to be more out of sight, out of mind, now ‚Äì back to normal, in a sense.\\" Paul Wertheimer, a security consultant, states: \\"Little has changed in a business where the biggest stars playing the most expensive concerts get the best security while cash-strapped clubs must simply hope no crazy people walk in bearing arms.\\" After Christina Grimmie was murdered in 2016 in similar circumstances to Abbott, Pantera released a post on its Facebook page calling on promoters and venue owners to improve security for artists. Tributes Black Label Society dedicated \\"In This River\\" (2005) to Abbott, and the song's music video features a depiction of Zakk Wylde's friendship with the slain musician. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold wrote the song \\"Betrayed\\" from City of Evil (2005) about Abbott's murder. He said: \\"It was my way of dealing with the whole thing after it happened. I never got to meet Dimebag, but he and Slash are my two greatest guitar heroes.\\" Nickelback included the tribute track \\"Side of a Bullet\\" on its album All the Right Reasons (2005). The song features a guitar solo constructed from outtakes of Abbott's solos recorded with Pantera. Disturbed's album Ten Thousand Fists (2005) was dedicated to Abbott's memory, as was Crowbar's Lifesblood for the Downtrodden (2005), and Static-X's Start a War (2005). Brides of Destruction wrote \\"Dimes in Heaven\\" for the album Runaway Brides (2005), and Cross Canadian Ragweed featured the tribute track \\"Dimebag\\" on its album Garage (2005). Type O Negative's frontman Peter Steele wrote the song \\"Halloween in Heaven\\" for the band's 2007 album Dead Again as a tribute to Abbott. Steele said: \\"Dimebag was a very close friend of Type O.\\" In response to an article that celebrated Abbott's death, Machine Head recorded the song \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\". It was included on the band's 2007 album The Blackening and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2008.

The most common lanthanocene complexes contain two cyclopentadienyl anions and an X type ligand, usually hydride or alkyl ligand.  History  In 1954, Wilkinson and Birmingham described the tris(cyclopentadienyl)lanthanide complex, Ln(C5H5)3 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm). However, due to the highly moisture and oxygen sensitive character of organolanthanide compounds, as well as the incapability of the separation of simple alkyl and aryl derivatives of the type LnR3, this area of organomemtallic chemistry experienced a period of relative stagnation for two decades before lanthanocene complexes were prepared for some of the later lanthanides (Ln = Gd, Er, Yb, Lu).  Synthesis  The synthesis part will focus on lanthanide(III) metallocene complexes that contain Ln-C bonds, which are widely prepared from the corresponding Ln-Cl precursors as shown. : + LiR ‚Üí + LiCl ::Ln = Y, Nd, Sm, Dy, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu ::R = Me, Et, iPr, nBu, tBu, CH2tBu, , , Ph, The synthetic route leading to lanthanocene chlorides are summarized: : + 2 ‚Üí + 2 MCl ::M = Na, Ti : + ‚Üí + + : + HCl ‚Üí +  Reactions  With the large 4f orbitals, lanthanide elements display properties significantly different from the common d-block transition metals. The large ionic radii limits the extent to which 4f orbitals can overlap with ligands, but at the same time allows the organolanthanide complexes to attain higher coordination numbers. As such, cyclopentadienyl anions (abbreviated Cp) are typically used to occupy the unsaturated site as well as stabilize the metal complex. Some of the alkyl and hydride lanthanocene complexes exhibit unique activities towards C-H bond activation, alkene functionalization, and carbonyl activation. 513x513px In 1983, Watson reported one of the first lanthanocene catalyzed C-H bond activation reactions. The active catalysts are lutetium-methyl or lutetium-hydride complexes, which react at room temperature in hydrocarbon solvents with benzene, pyridine, and the ylide CH2PPh3 to give stable, isolatable products. Studies have shown that organolanthanides are extraordinary catalysts for hydrofunctionalization reactions including hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hydroboration, hydroamination, etc. Examples for each type have shown below. alt=Mechanism for hydrogenation is shown below, where the active catalyst is generated by sigma-bond metathesis, followed by olefin insertion and another sigma-bond metathesis to regenerate the catalyst. This is also the mechanism for other hydrofunctionalization. 326x326px thumb Yet, as the large cyclopentadienyl ligand hinders the metal center, reactions with substituted alkenes are inhibited. Two general methods are used to overcome this difficulty. One is to increase the size of metal by incorporating lanthanides with larger ionic radii. Due to the lanthanide contraction, this means replacing the late lanthanides with the early lanthanides. Another method is to decrease the size of the ligand by manipulating the geometry of ligands and substitutions on ligands.

Kalm√°r was Executive Director and Chief Curator of Artists Space, New York from 2009 to 2016, Director of Kunstverein M√ºnchen from 2004 to 2009, Director of the Institute of Visual Culture, Cambridge from 2000 to 2004 and Artistic Director of Cubitt Gallery, London from 1997 to 1999. Kalm√°r was a judge for the Turner Prize in 2014. Kalm√°r is a member of the Artistic Team for the 13th edition of Manifesta in Marseille 2020, together with Alya Sebti and Katerina Chuchalina. Education Kalm√°r studied Cultural Studies at University of Hildesheim, Germany before moving to London in 1995 to continue to study Cultural and Curatorial Studies at Goldsmiths College, London. Career =ICA= Under Kalm√°r‚Äôs directorship, the ICA signed the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge and became an accredited Living Wage employer. The ICA cinema became fully independent and live performance, theatre and literature were reintroduced to the ICA programme. In an interview published in Frieze in 2017, Kalm√°r outlined his future ambitions for the ICA to be an organization that revitalizes the belief and the civic responsibility of cultural institutions by trying to create an organizational structure that not only disclaims its own contradictions but actively tries to overcome them. Named in ArtReview's 2019 Power 100, Kalm√°r commented, 'We are in a time of crisis' in reference to Brexit and the rise of populism, and stated that 'these are times for artists to lead' regarding the announcement of Wolfgang Tillmans' appointment as Chair of the ICA's Board. =Artists Space= Notable exhibitions during Kalm√°r‚Äôs tenure include presentations on and collaborations with artists and curators such as Chris Kraus and Julie Ault, Danh Vo, Bernadette Corporation, Cameron Rowland, Laura Poitras, Zilia S√°nchez, Lukas Duwenh√∂gger, Marc Camille Chaimowicz and The Estate of Charlotte Posenenske. In a review of the Charlotte Posenenske exhibition, The New York Times art critic, Roberta Smith, wrote, 'It occurred to me that if Alfred H. Barr Jr., founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, were dropped into Mr. Kalm√°r‚Äôs shoes, he would have come up with something similar'. In 2016 Kalm√°r said that Artists Space has been increasingly involved in addressing the interplay and blurred lines between contemporary art and political practice with a focus on gentrification and how contemporary arts organisations ‚Äúinstitutionalise antagonisms.‚Äù Artists Space and Common Practice invited artists Nitasha Dhillon and Amin Husain of the collective MTL+ to facilitate programming that would unite activist groups across the city under five ‚Äústrands‚Äù: Indigenous Struggle, Black Liberation, Free Palestine, Global Wage Workers, and De-Gentrification. In 2012, Kalm√°r introduced a second location, Artists Space Books & Talks, which has become a platform for critical discussion in contemporary art and culture. Artists Space‚Äôs 2012 exhibition Radical Localism: Art, Video and Culture From Pueblo Nuevo‚Äôs Mexicali Rose, was described by The New York Times as ‚Äòa small but vigorous sampling of what is emerging‚Äô from Mexicali Rose, an alternative art space and community centre established by the filmmaker Marco Vera in Pueblo Nuevo, a working-class neighbourhood in Mexicali, a city on the Mexican side of the border with the United States.

Sanchez Charter Schools is a state charter secondary school system in Houston, Texas, operated by the Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans (AAMA; ). It operates George I. Sanchez Charter School, also known as George I. Sanchez High School; and George I. Sanchez Charter School North. They are located in the East End and Northside, respectively.\\"Map\\" (). East End Management District. Retrieved on March 8, 2010. the schools cater to students who experienced difficulties at other schools. History Sanchez was established as a private school and was converted into a charter school, making it one of the first charter schools in Texas. Campus The East End campus is located at the AAMA complex on Interstate 45, and in 2002 was surrounded by industrial facilities. The current three story building of the East End campus opened in 2009, with a cost of $7.5 million. The building design was inspired by Mayan architecture. A ceramic tile mural, funded by grant money from the Texas Commission on the Arts and the United Way of Greater Houston, was unveiled at the East End campus in 2008. The Orange Show Center for Visionary Art oversaw its creation, done by Sanchez students. The first East End building had a capacity of 300-400 students. Student body the East End campus had about 600 students. By 2001 the enrollment there was about 500, above the capacity of the facility. Operations The school does not have zero tolerance policies held in traditional school districts. In 2001 the school administration stated that it had a relatively lean school spending apparatus, so it could do more tasks with a lower budget. Academic performance In 2002 77% of the students passed the state writing tests, 87% passed the mathematics tests, and 95% passed the reading tests. In 2001 11th grade students (juniors) were in the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) mathematics test 90th percentile and 10th grade students (sophomores) were in the TAAS mathematics 80th percentile. The school's mathematics scores increased by 28 points in 2000. As of 2001, and 2003, the school had relatively low accountability ratings from the state due to a large number of students dropping out, despite its test scores.

The disk is gaseous and counter-rotates with respect to the inner disc. The outer part of the inner disc exhibits a population of counter-rotating stars that may be related to the outer ring. The observed counter-rotation suggests that the ring resulted from the accretion of gas from the passage of another galaxy. However, Ilyina et al. proposed that the ring is the result of a satellite galaxy vertically impacting onto the central part of NGC 4513 as the ring is bright in UV and is symmetric.

He was born within the West India Islands in Jamaica on September 7, and he died on November 22, in Walla Walla, Washington Territory. He was known as the first African- American businessman in Walla Walla, Washington. Parade for 4th of July celebration down Main Street, Walla Walla, Washington, 1892 (WASTATE 283) Early life Bogle was born in Jamaica in 1835 to parents who were slaves until 1833. At the age of 12, he escaped by smuggling himself onto a ship bound for New York, where he remained for one year before moving to Michigan. He stayed in Michigan for a short time before joining a wagon train to the Oregon Territory at age 16 in 1851. Three years later, Bogle packed up and left to Yreka, California, and studied under Nathan Ferber, as a barber. From there, he traveled to Deadwood, California three years later, and he mined for gold, while he opened a barbershop and a restaurant. Bogle returned to Oregon three years later, the ‚Äúland of promise‚Äù in mid-October to start a barbershop in Roseburg. He followed this trade until 1862 when he moved to visit the mining camps in Florence, Elk City, and Ori Fine in Idaho before returning to the Walla Walla Valley.  Wedding controversy and marriage to America Waldo  On January 1, 1863, the same day that the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Bogle married America Waldo, an Oregon pioneer from Missouri. The wedding caused controversy due to the attendance of several white guests, including Oregon Supreme Court judge Joseph G. Wilson and state legislator Daniel Waldo. Daniel, who raised America and is thought to have been her uncle, gave them \\"several gifts of great value with which to start their home.\\" Bogle and America Waldo were married in a private home by Obed Dickinson, a pastor known for advocating African American equality in Oregon who was sent by New England's American Home Missionary Society to establish a congregation in the Salem area. After officiating the wedding, Dickinson's congregation received even more criticism and heightened racial tension in Oregon that would continue until after the Civil War. Newspaper editor Asahel Bush called the wedding \\"shameful\\" for its \\"negro equality sentiment\\". However, The Oregonian defended Wilson and Waldo's attendance, writing that \\"the good feeling thus frequently called forth\\" by the presence of white guests \\"is one of the gratifications of the blacks that reconciles them to their lot.\\"  Later life in Walla Walla  Later, Bogle and his family bought then ran a successful 200-acre ranch and settled in eastern Washington. Bogle is buried in Mountain View Cemetery, Walla Walla, Washington in Walla Walla County. At the Fort Walla Walla Museum in WashingtonFort Walla Walla Museum, a 15-acre park consisting of four historic exhibits and a seventeen-building pioneer village, Bogle's life is being presented by a member of the Living History troupe. Fort Walla Walla, Washington, 1862 (WASTATE 895)  Walla Walla businesses  Soon after their wedding, the Bogles moved to Walla Walla, Washington. Richard Bogle started a barbershop on Main Street, making him the first black businessman in Walla Walla on ‚Äúproprietor of the tonsorial parlors at No.3 Second Street.‚Äù Racial segregation made it difficult for black visitors to find accommodation in Walla Walla, so Bogle often allowed them to stay in his shop. He was a co- founder of the Walla Walla Savings and Loan Association. After working, as a barber for several years until his health deteriorated he turned the business over to his sons. Family Of America Waldo and Richard Bogle's eight children, five lived into adulthood. Bogle's three oldest children appear to have died between 1876 and 1878. His younger children- Belle, Waldo, Arthur, Warren, and Katherine\\\\- lived to adulthood. Two of their three sons followed in their father's path and became professional barbers in Portland, Oregon. Bogle's son, Waldo Bogle, moved to Portland in 1913, to operate their barbershop \\"in the Golden West Hotel\\" thankful for the \\"courtesy of the Oregon historical society\\". Their great-grandson, also named Richard Bogle, became the second African-American city commissioner in Portland, Oregon.

Works  His notname is derived from a still-life with flower and fruits, on a table, kept at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut. By comparing this painting with similar ones, a style group was created. Certain elements reminiscent of Caravaggio have been detected. Suggestions that these are by the young Caravaggio himself are reasonable, given the similarity of his lighting effects, but it seems more reasonable to assume that he was one of Caravaggio's students. Three painters have received serious consideration as being this Master; Francesco Zucchi (?-1621), Bernardino Cesari and Giovanni Battista Crescenzi. Other works in the group assigned to him include flower still lifes in the gallery of the in Spoleto and the Galleria Borghese, a fruit still-life at the Museum Kunstpalast in D√ºsseldorf and an unusual bird still-life, also at the Galleria Borghese.

The Dumbell summit is slightly higher than the northeast subpeak (8,415 ft) which is unofficially called Greenwood Mountain. Its nearest higher neighbor is Chiwawa Mountain, to the east-southeast. Precipitation runoff from Dumbell Mountain drains into tributaries of the Chelan River and the Wenatchee River. The mountain's descriptive name was applied by Albert Hale Sylvester (1871-1944), a pioneer surveyor, explorer, topographer, and forest supervisor in the Cascades. Geology Dumbell Mountain is located in the Cloudy Pass batholith, an intrusive formation that was formed approximately , during the early Miocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.CLOUDY PASS BATHOLITH AND ASSOCIATED ROCKS USGS The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Southwest aspect from Spider Meadow area During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about . Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is southwest of Dumbell Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Climate Dumbell Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

This protein is believed to aid in the process of procollagen folding and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum that functions to process and transport proteins. Procollagens are collagen precursors located in the extracellular matrix that give tissues elasticity, strength, and support. This gene is involved in patterning the collagen structure. FKBP prolyl isomerase 14 may also be involved in altering other factors in the extracellular matrix. Mutations of this gene are associated with the kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers- Danlos syndrome. This condition is characterized by a high range of joint movement, muscle atrophy, curved spine, and delicate cardiovascular vessels. These symptoms are brought about by a loss of the protein which results in a disruption of endoplasmic reticulum activities and extracellular matrix organization. FKBP14 mRNA levels are found higher in ovarian cancer tissues than healthy ovarian tissue and knocked down expression of FKBP14 by lentiviral shRNA leads to an impaired proliferative ability of ovarian cancer cells.

Life He was born in Baghdad in 1030 AH (1630 AD), where he received his early education, excelling in science and literature, and mastering Arabic, Persian and Turkish. He travelled from Baghdad to Damascus in 1048 AH/1638 AD and contacted the head of the student supervisors, who became his first professor in Damascus. He then joined the circle of Mu·∏•ammad bin Ya·∏•yƒÅ al-Furthi to study Arabic science. In 1050 AH/1640 AD, he went to Egypt to join a group of scholars of the Al-Azhar Mosque. His most prominent professors were Yassin Al-Homsi and Shahab ad-dƒ´n Al-Khafaji, author of Rƒ´hƒÅna Al-AlbƒÅ () and Shefa Al-Ghalƒ´l (). Al-Khafaji recognised the cultural significance of al-Baghdadi‚Äôs literary work and bequeathed him his library after his death. In 1077 AH/1667 AD, Abdul Qadir left Egypt to visit the Ottoman capital in Istanbul, but soon returned. He was a close companion of the governor IbrƒÅhƒ´m Kutkhda. When the governor removed to the Levant in 1085 AH/1674 AD, and then to Edirne, he took Abdul Qadir with him. In Edirne, Abdul Qadir met Ibn FadlallƒÅh al-Mahabƒ´, author of the KhlƒÅsa al-'Athr () ‚Äì 'Concise Traditions of the Eminent of the 11th-century' ‚Äì who was a friend of his father‚Äôs. In Edirne (Turkey), Abdul Qadir contracted an untreatable illness. He travelled in some Turkish countries before returning to Cairo where he died in 1093 AH/ 1682 AD The great reformist sultan Ahmed Pasha K√∂pr√ºl√º brought Abdul Qadir into his employ with a commission to surpass ibn HishƒÅm al-An·π£arƒ´‚Äôs ¬´Commentary¬ª, by writing the definitive commentary on the ancient poem BƒÅnat Su'ad by Ka øb ibn Zuhayr. Meanwhile, Abdul Qadir al- BaghdƒÅdƒ´ came to the notice of the Ottoman Sultan Mu·∏•ammad ibn Sultan IbrƒÅhƒ´m, the reputated \\"Sultan of Literature\\". Al-Baghdadi left many works of translation, mostly of the pre-Islamic writers and poets. Legacy Abdul Qadir al-Baghdadi‚Äôs library with its philological and literary collections, is one of the most important libraries of the Ottoman era. His methodology of transmission takes the classical form, known as isnƒÅd, as a way of explaining and controlling his narration by citing an unbroken chain of witness testimony. In the accounts of some of the famous poets he mentions not just the witness, but also the 'house', i.e. the genealogy, and the preceding and succeeding verses on which the meaning depends, or in the case of rare poems, he quotes the entire poem, cites its witness and explains the strange and the background of its origin. Thus, he preserved material important to interpretation of the ancient Arabic poetry within its cultural context. Abdul Qadir contributed to the conservation of the prose traditions of the Arabs, together with the scientific-literary corpus held within. He memorized the al- dawawin (collected poems) of Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani and Maqama of Al-Hariri and the histories of the Arabs, the Persians and the Turks. His writings express a liberal mind, keen awareness and deep knowledge, while they record his critical approach to received dogma. Critics called him the best scholar and preserver of the literary canon of the Arabs, their systems and prose, narrators of facts and wars and days, and the headquarters of Hariri, the Arab authors, language and poetry contained in the wonderful stories fixed in the transfer and increased in credit through his analytical criticism.

He tried in vain to save the life of Dutch statesman Johan van Oldenbarnevelt after he was sentenced to death in the Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets. Personal life Aubery was born the son of Jehan Aubery du Maurier and his second wife Madeleine Froger.Ouvr√©, p. 5 His parents were both huguenots. He was therefore also raised in that faith. He studied in Le Mans, and after 1582 in Paris at several colleges, among which the Coll√®ge de Clermont. He studied philosophy under Theodore Beza for a year after 1583 in the Republic of Geneva. He was destined for a career in the noblesse de robe, because a great-uncle (Jacques Aubery) was an advocate before the parlement de Paris during the reign of Henry II of France. (He took part in the prosecution of the perpetrators of the M√©rindol massacre.Ouvr√©, pp.6-7; Martin, chap. 1er). But the events of the French religious troubles intervened. In 1585 (a year after his father died) the huguenots were given six months to convert to Roman Catholicism or to go into exile. Aubery decided to join the army of the prince of Cond√© and took part in the Battle of Coutras under Navarre in 1587. From there his career took flight.Ouvr√©, pp. 7-8; Martin, chap. 1er Aubrey married Marie Magdeleine in 1600 in Paris. They would have eleven children of whom Louis Aubery du Maurier (a historian) is the best known. Other sons were Maximilien (who later served in the States Army), and Daniel (also a military officer). When he lived in the Netherlands as ambassador he had them educated by Benjamin Prideaux as preceptor on an estate belonging to Oldenbarnevelt. Among his daughters were Louise, born in 1614 in The Hague (who had Louise de Coligny for a godmother); Eleonore, born in 1615 in The Hague (with Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange as a godfather); and Emilia (with Countess Emilia of Nassau as a godmother).Vander Aa, pp. 425-426 His first wife Marie died in 1620 in The Hague when Aubery was ambassador there. She was buried in the Grote Kerk with a sumptuous grave monument. He remarried in 1622 with Ren√©e de Jaucourt de Villarnoult, a relative of his mentor Philippe du Plessis-Mornay.Ouvr√©, p. 318 Career =Assistant of the Huguenot Great Nobles= Aubery first went into the employ of du Plessis- Mornay as a secretary when that minister of the king of Navarre became governor of Saumur in 1589. He accompanied du Plessis-Mornay when he was sent on a mission to Queen Elizabeth in 1591-92.Ouvr√©, pp. 9-10 On 22 October 1590 Henri IV made Aubery a secretary in his household of Navarre. After du Plessis-Mornay broke with Henri IV, Aubery also became intendant to the new favorite, Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon on 1 June 1592, shortly after the duke had married Charlotte de La Marck.Ouvr√©, p.19 When that lady died in 1594 Aubery helped select a new wife, Countess Elisabeth of Nassau, the half-sister of the Dutch stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange.Ouvr√©, p. 39 Aubery remained in the service of the duke, but when Bouillon fell in disfavor after he was implicated in the conspiracy of Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron in 1601, Aubery was placed in a difficult position between the king and the duke. But he managed to extricate himself, principally by being instrumental in negotiating a reconciliation between the king and the duke in April of 1607.Ouvr√©, pp.80-84, 141-146 After the submission of the duke to the king Aubery quit the service of the duke and retired to his chateau du Maurier for some time. Things started to look up for Aubery when in 1607 he was approached by the envoy of France to the Dutch Republic, Paul Trude Choart, duke of Buzenval, who needed a correspondent in France to facilitate the transfer of the subsidies France paid to the Dutch Republic. But Buzenval soon after died. The successor of Buzenval had someone else in mind, but the secretary of state Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy overruled him. Then Villeroy's colleague Maximilien de B√©thune, Duke of Sully, the Superintendent of Finances appointed Aubery controleur des restes des etats du Conseil in October 1607.Ouvr√©, pp. 147-149, 157-158Sully also became godfather to Aubery's son Maximilien on 5 November 1608 as another sign of his favor; Cf. Ouvr√©, p. 165 At the same time the king also showed favor to Aubery, making him one of the twenty secretaries in his royal household on 30 August 1608. But this high point in Aubery's career ended soon after the assassination of the king on 14 May 1610. Sully was soon taken down by his jealous colleagues, and took Aubery with him in his fall. Another deception was that the office of president of the audit court of the province of N√©rac, that Aubery had bought in 1610 with the consent of the king, was given to another claimant by the Conseil d'Etat; Aubery only received a pension. In 1612 he retired for a while to his chateau.Ouvr√©, pp. 165-168 =Embassy to the Dutch Republic= But then Villeroy asked him for the post of ambassador to the Dutch Republic, as successor of Eustache de Refuge. This was an important post as the Republic played a big part in the European policy of Henri IV and later the regency of Queen Marie de' Medici. The Republic had become an important ally in the early 1590s when Henri was fighting both the Catholic League's armies and the Spanish Army of Flanders. After he triumphed in France Henri needed the Republic as a counterweight against Spain in Europe. He definitely wanted the Republic in the French sphere of influence. When the Habsburg regime in the Spanish Netherlands made peace overtures to their northern counterparts when a stalemate in the Eighty Years' War developed in 1607, Henri sent Pierre Jeannin as a special envoy to The Hague to defend the French interests. Jeannin was instrumental in helping Land's Advocate of Holland Oldenbarnevelt obtain the Twelve Years' Truce with Spain (after a peace proved elusive) over the objections of stadtholder Maurice.Ouvr√©, pp. 171-181 The alliance between the two countries was founded on two treaties. The first one, concluded on 13 January 1608 and renewed on 17 June 1609, valid for the duration of the Truce, promised that France would send 10,000 soldiers to help the States General in case of war; the Republic 5000 to help France. The two countries promised not to make treaties that would harm the interests of the other. The second treaty of 22 June 1609 promised two French regiments (4100 men in total) and two companies of light horse for service in the Dutch States Army, with an annual subsidy of 600,000 livres. The Queen confirmed this arrangement in 1611. These French troops would later play an important part.Ouvr√©, p.190 Villeroy had selected Aubery in preference to several other candidates, because he was a moderate protestant with undoubted loyalty to the crown. The new ambassador needed to be a protestant, because a catholic would be distrusted in the protestant Republic, but he should not be a partisan of the huguenot fanatics in France.Ouvr√©, p. 198 The salary for the ambassador to the States General of the Dutch Republic was 12,000 livres, supplemented with 24,000 livres for the post of intendant of the French finances in Holland.Ouvr√©, p. 200 Aubery took up the post on 20 May 1613Ouvr√©, p. 202 The first, somewhat disagreeable, task for Aubery was to engineer the recall of the Dutch ambassador in France, Francis van Aarssens (son of the secretary of the States General Cornelis van Aarsens), who was seen as \\"too pushy\\" by the French court. Discreet overtures to Oldenbarnevelt did not prove sufficient, as van Aarssens put up a spirited defense before the States General. So Aubery had to openly disavow van Aarssens, which did the trick, but earned him and Oldenbarnevelt the undying enmity of the politician, who was influential with stadtholder Maurice.Ouvr√©, pp. 202-212 Next Aubery had to defend the interests of France when the Republic intervened in the War of the J√ºlich Succession, when despite the Truce it almost came to blows with Spain, which Aubery and de Refuge (who had become French envoy in Brussels) helped avoid through mediation. Meanwhile events in France herself took a turn for the worse with the repeated revolts of the princes of the blood against the regency of Queen Marie. This led to attempts of both sides to get the French regiments in Dutch service to return to France, which Aubery managed to thwart. This did not endear him to the princes.Ouvr√©, pp. 214-250 Meanwhile, on 3 September 1615 Queen Marie had appointed Aubery conseiller d'√âtat; this was confirmed by the new king Louis XIII of France on 31 SeptemberOuvr√©, p. 245, 250 Polemical allegory of Arminianism as a five-headed monster, referring to the five articles of the 1610 Remonstrance Aubery of necessity played an important role in the religious and political crisis in the Dutch Republic that developed between 1614 and 1619 and that has become known in Dutch historiography as the Bestandstwisten (Truce Quarrels). This started with a quarrel between two professors of theology at Leiden University, Franciscus Gomarus and Jacobus Arminius, about the interpretation of the dogma of the Predestination. Soon other ministers of the public church, the Dutch Reformed Church took sides, and with them their flocks in the local congregations of that church. As the Dutch authorities felt a duty to keep the peace in the church, so as to avoid a schism, the States of Holland and West Friesland got involved when the followers of Arminius in 1610 presented a remonstrance (petition) to them, that was soon followed by a counter-remonstrance from the other side. The States were reluctant to take sides in the doctrinal quarrel, but when the quarrel flowed over into the public sphere, and ministers of either side refused to recognize the qualifications of the others to administer the Lord's Supper and congregations split into warring parties, they felt constraint to issue the so-called \\"For the Peace of the Church\\" Resolution in January 1614 (drafted by the Rotterdam pensionary Hugo Grotius), which prohibited preaching about the quarrel from the pulpit on pain of losing their livings for the preachers.Though the Resolution did not prescribe one or the other standpoint in the doctrinal debate and did not prohibit discussions within the confines of the university, or in learned treatises written in Latin Unfortunately, this only proved to pour fuel on the fire. Violence of especially Counter- Remonstrant mobs directed against Remonstrant regenten and city magistrates, while the local schutterijen refused to offer protection and the federal troops also refused to intervene, caused the States of Holland to issue a further so-called Sharp Resolution in 1617. This authorized city governments to recruit their own mercenary forces, called waardgelders, to keep the peace. This was seen by the stadtholder as a dangerous potential threat, because the waardgelders might come into armed conflict with the federal States Army, which he commanded as Captain general. Maurice then chose the side of the Counter-Remonstrants and started a slow-moving coup d'√©tat that took the form of his undermining the regime of Oldenbarnevelt by \\"turning around\\" by intimidation the city governments that supported the latter in the States, and so engineering a majority of the States General opposing Holland. This majority also forced through the convening of a National Synod of the Reformed Church, over the opposition of Oldenbarnevelt and his allies, with the object of deciding the doctrinal controversy.Ouvr√©, pp. 251-305 In this conflict Aubery did not stay neutral, but he chose the side of the Oldenbarnevelt regime on the orders of the French court (that, as catholics, preferred the perceived \\"least calvinist\\" Arminians). He advised the States General against convening a National Synod in October 1617. But in vain, the majority of four provinces voted in November of 1617 to convene such a Synod in Dordrecht in 1618 and to invite foreign theologians (also from FranceThe French court objected to this idea; Cf. Ouvr√©, p. 269). Aubery then approached the States of Holland to advise them to try to solve the matter with a provincial synod, which was also the point of view of Oldenbarnevelt. But things got out of hand when Maurice started to force matters in January 1618 with a coup in Nijmegen. The matter of the synod went to the background temporarily. Aubery tried repeatedly to mediate between Maurice and Oldenbarnevelt, but in his dispatches to the French government he vented his suspicion that Maurice was bent on replacing the people who had brought about the Truce and to replace them with members of the Dutch war partyOuvr√©, p. 277 The States General decided to send a deputation to king Louis to invite him to send three or four French protestant theologians to the planned National Synod, but the French government prevented this by sending Jean de Thumery, sieur de Boississe (a seasoned diplomat. who had been ambassador to England in 1601) as a special envoy to The Hague to help mediate in the quarrel around the Synod. De Boissise arrived in early August 1618, just after the political events had reached crisis mode with the forced disbandment of the waardgelders of the city of Utrecht by a mission of the States General, led by stadtholder Maurice at the end of July. Maurice proceeded by changing the composition of the States of Utrecht, robbing Holland of its only ally in the States General. When de Boissise made his maiden address to the States General in mid August, he therefore could do little to alter the state of affairs. He made things worse by complaining about a libelous pamphlet van Aarssen had published about the alleged sinister designs of king Louis in cahoots with Spain. Van Aarssens himself wrote the polite rejection of this diplomatic note by the States General. Meanwhile, on 29 August 1618 Maurice had arrested Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and two other leaders of the majority in the States of Holland, thereby consolidating his coup.Ouvr√©, pp. 284-286 On 17 September 1618 Aubery and Boissise visited Maurice to protest the arrests. Maurice told them that the arrests were necessary because Oldenbarnevelt had conspired with Spain to bring the Republic back under the \\"Spanish yoke\\". This also made it necessary to change the composition of the governments of the cities in Holland that had supported Oldenbarnevelt, he said. The two ambassadors replied that France was a guarantor of the old constitution of the Republic and that these changes were illegal in their eyes. But they were powerless to do anything about it. In November the National Synod commenced, without French participation; it would become known as the Synod of DortOuvr√©, pp. 288-295 Meanwhile, the trial of Oldenbarnevelt had proceeded behind closed doors, without much being made public except for vague utterances by the likes of Aarssens that \\"the life of the prisoners was incompatible with the security of the state\\".Ouvr√©, p. 291 The French ambassadors addressed the States General on 12 December and expressed the hope that the trial would be brief and the prisoners be judged by their own court (i.e. the Hof van Holland), according to the established laws. They added that the king of France demanded clemency in view of the services Oldenbarnevelt had rendered, and the old friendship between the two countries. The response of the States General, drafted by Aarssens, on 17 December, feigned surprise about the reproach by the French king, and predicted that the king would think differently when he learned from the verdicts, which were expected soon, about the gravity of the conspiracy.Ouvr√©, p. 295 To the frustration of Aubery, his old enemy Aarssens was appointed by Maurice as a replacement of one of the purged members of the Holland ridderschap (College of NoblesWhich College had one vote in the States of Holland; the College had been one of the mainstays of the Oldenbarnevelt regime, but the appointment of new members changed its political makeup) on 19 January 1619, which was taken as a new insult to France. Still, the ridderschap made a last attempt to have the trial transferred to the regular court of Holland, but eventually consented to the installation of a court of 24 delegated judges of the States General, of whom half were to be nominated by the States of Holland. Nevertheless, the two ambassadors made a last attempt on 23 January to have the prisoners tried by the Holland court, evidently without success.Ouvr√©, pp. 295-297 Seeing that he could not do anything useful anymore, Boissise asked to be recalled on 12 February 1619, and Aubery did the same a few days later. But then events in France took a negative turn. Queen Marie, who had been a prisoner since the assassination of her counselor Concino Concini two years earlier, managed to escape from her prison in Blois on 22 February 1619, and France was once again thrown into civil war. This made it impossible for Aubery to leave his post. The States General felt little inclination to intervene in this French crisis, which gave Boissise occasion to remind them of their treaty obligations in his farewell address to the States General of 23 March 1619. Aubery remained alone in The Hague. He had received instructions to try and intercede in the trial, which he did with an address to the States General on 1 May 1613. This was received as an attack on the justice of the delegated judges. Aubery then pleaded with one of those judges, Cromhout (also president of the Hof van Holland) to transmit his plea to his colleaguesOuvr√©, pp. 299-300 The verdict against Oldenbarnevelt was taken on Saturday 11 May 1619. He would receive the death sentence, which was to be executed on Monday 13 May. This was kept secret, but word got out to Louise de Coligny, widow of William the Silent and stepmother of Maurice, a good friend of both Oldenbarnevelt and her countryman Aubery, in the night of 12 on 13 May 1619. She warned Aubery and went herself at 4 o'clock in the morning to Maurice to plead for mercy for OldenbarneveltAs stadtholder Maurice had the residual power of the pardon, though he was emphatically not the sovereign of the Republic. At the same time Aubery went to the States General, also in the Binnenhof government center, and demanded an audience, but because of the early hour the States General was not in session. Aubery therefore composed a letter on the spot, that read in part: But his intervention was met with evasions by a few delegates of the States General who met him at this early hour. \\"The power had been delegated to the judges\\" (but you still have the power of the sovereign, Aubery replied, and you can commute the sentence) and \\"the States General don't have a quorum right now\\" (to which Aubery replied that they could defer the execution until a quorum was established). The delegates promised to inform the full States General of his requests, but he did not hear back from them before the execution had taken place the next morning. Oldenbarnevelt was taken before the court and his verdict read to him. Immediately afterward, he was taken to the scaffold and beheaded. A few days later Aubery received an answer of sorts in the form of a letter to king Louis, drafted by Aarssens, in which it was stated that the king was badly informed by his ministers; the king was too just to appear to justify such a black treason before the eyes of the whole of Europe.Ouvr√©, p. 302 Execution of Oldenbarnevelt on 13 May 1619 by Jan Luyken After this the relations between the Republic and France became icy for a number of years. Maurice and Aubery quarreled openly in their encounters.The exiled Arminian ministers were made welcome in France by king Louis, as well as Hugo Grotius, who escaped from his life imprisonment in Loevestein Castle in March 1621, and went into exile in Paris. When the States General outlawed him, king Louis put him under his protection and gave him a pension of 3000 livres. Grotius' Apology was printed freely in France in 1622 and smuggled to the Republic, where it was prohibited. His correspondence nevertheless entered the Republic in the French diplomatic mail.Ouvr√©, p. 312 But the French government at this time was divided between the partisans of Spain and her opponents. Queen Marie, who was again a power to be reckoned with, and who was now anti-Spain, succeeded in getting the annual subsidy of 600,000 livres to the Republic, that had been suspended since 1618, restored again with the Treaty of Compi√®gne in 1624, which was welcome, as the Republic had been at war with Spain since the Truce ended in 1621.Ouvr√©, p. 313-315 Aubery was no part of this, as he had fallen victim to the fall of Nicolas Br√ªlart de Sillery as foreign secretary, like many other ambassadors of France. He left The Hague on 12 April 1624 and arrived on 20 April at the court in Compi√®gne, where the king received him with honor and renewed his appointment as conseiller d'√âtat, but let him retire from public service.Ouvr√©, pp. 315-316 =Final years= Aubery retired to his chateau du Maurier. He spent his retirement taking care of his agricultural estates, and in maintaining a correspondence with his wide circle of friends, such as Fran√ßois Auguste de Thou, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, Daniel Heinsius, and of course Grotius, who composed an epitaph in Latin for his first wife.The correspondence with Grotius is available online in He himself wrote poetry in French and Latin and left for his children the manuscript of his Memoires that has been excerpted by Henri Ouvr√© and was edited by Claire Martin in 2010.Under the title .Ouvr√©, pp. 316-322 Aubery died after 31 July 1636 (when he received a last letter from Grotius) in the place where he was born.

Bowman Becks (March 28, 1880 ‚Äì ?), also known as Ida M. Becks, was an American elocutionist, suffragist, and African-American community organizer. She played prominent roles in establishing a number of community organizations, especially in Kansas City, Kansas, from the 1910s to the late 1940s. Life Ida M. Bowman was born on March 28, 1880 in Armstrong, Missouri. She was the daughter of Milton Bowman. Bowman finished grammar school in 1896, and then attended the Lincoln School in Carrollton, Missouri. She graduated in 1899 as class valedictorian. Bowman then did post-graduate studies in Wichita, Kansas. She moved to Dayton, Ohio and began working as the secretary of the Colored Women‚Äòs League. While in Dayton, she met H. W. Becks. The two married in 1907. In 1908, the couple moved to Kansas City, Kansas. Becks worked for two years as the field representative for the Florence Crittenton Home in Topeka, Kansas. She then became the field representative for the National Training School in Washington, D.C., under the auspices of the Women‚Äôs Auxiliary of the National Baptist Convention. Becks was also a nationally-known elocutionist and an ‚Äúardent suffragist.‚Äù She trained at the Chicago School of Elocution and spoke publicly at Chautauqua schools and other public events. Becks wrote a play entitled Up From Slavery: Evening's Entertainment in 8 Acts, which she copyrighted in 1916. In 1919, she spoke at a memorial service for Theodore Roosevelt at Second Baptist Church in Kansas City (where Becks and her husband were members), discussing Roosevelt‚Äôs views on women's suffrage. In the same year, Becks led a debate about women‚Äôs suffrage at Ebenezer AME Church.: 144 Becks continued her public health work as well. In 1919, she fundraised for the Red Cross, and led the drive to establish a chapter of the Urban League and a community center for African- American men. In the early 1920s she served on the board of directors of the Wheatley-Provident Hospital. She also helped establish a local chapter of the YWCA to serve the African-American community.: 145 In 1921, Becks was one of five delegates to the NAACP convention in Detroit. That year she also established a Kansas City chapter of the Negro Women‚Äôs National Republican League, of which she was elected chairman. Becks was also a delegate representing Kansas City at the 1925 National Negro Educational Congress. She and her fellow delegates ‚Äúuse[d] the congress as a forum for a critique of American society and of black responses within that society.‚Äù: 128,165 By 1926, Becks was serving as the president of the City Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. That year, the Federation clashed with the local NAACP when the latter called for a boycott of a performance of The Miracle, due to the show's purportedly segregated seating. Becks and a friend eschewed the boycott; they purchased tickets and attended the show, in her words, \\"unmolested, in a section where very few colored people were seated.\\" Becks and her husband lived in Kansas City and remained active in the Baptist Church through the late 1940s.: 145 References Becks, Ida M.

He served as the Chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party from 1998 to 2003 and from 2011 to 2013. Harpootlian currently holds a position on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Early life, education and career  Harpootlian is a 1972 graduate of Clemson University and a 1974 graduate of the University of South Carolina School of Law. As a prosecutor Harpootlian earned convictions in the prosecutions of Pee Wee Gaskins and Jim Holderman. He ran for attorney general in 1994 losing to Charlie Condon in the general election. Harpootlian served as the Chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party twice. He is credited for the South Carolina Democratic Party's decision to move the South Carolina primary earlier in the primary schedule.  South Carolina Senate  = Election = On June 4, 2018, John E. Courson resigned his senate seat after pleading guilty to mishandling campaign funds. Courson's resignation was related to the \\"Quinndom\\" led by David Pascoe which found multiple instances of wrongdoing in the South Carolina General Assembly. In November 2018, Harpootlian defeated Benjamin Dunn in a special election for Courson's old senate seat. It was the first time in 14 years a Democrat flipped a Republican-held Senate seat. = Political views in the Senate = Since joining the Senate, Harpootlian has been critical of the University of South Carolina's hiring practices and legislation giving the Carolina Panthers tax incentives to move their headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina. In May 2019, Harpootlian commissioned his own independent analysis on the economic benefits of moving the Panthers headquarters to Rock Hill. The report found that the added jobs to the area were a third of what the state of South Carolina's review found. Harpootlian stalled the Senate vote on the measure although it later passed. In November of 2019 Harpootlian was criticized for profanely threatening to have an aide of the Richland County Legislation Delegation fired over a press release which failed to include job openings at the Columbia airport. In December of 2019 he called the university's search for the president's next chief of staff \\"cronyism at its finest.\\" Harpootlian came out against a bill in the senate which would legalize curbside pickup for alcohol products in January of 2020.  Democratic Party presidential primaries  = Endorsements = During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Harpootlian stated that he was a \\"Joe Biden guy.\\" He endorsed Bernie Sanders for President on February 3, 2016, comparing Sanders' passion with the kind Obama exuded in 2007 when they had first met.\\" In 2020, Harpootlian endorsed Joe Biden for President, stating \\"If the Democratic Party believes nominating a socialist is the way to win in November, they need to start drug testing at the national committee\\" in reference to Sanders. = Controversies = In September 2012, Harpootlian drew controversy when he compared then-governor Nikki Haley to Eva Braun, the mistress of Adolf Hitler. The remarks were condemned by Norm Coleman, the chair of the Jewish coalition of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, who accused him of \\"trivializing Nazism\\". Harpootlian drew further controversy in 2013 for remarks he made at the annual Jackson-Jefferson dinner of the state Democratic Party, where he said that they needed to \\"send Nikki Haley back to wherever the hell she came from\\"; Haley is Indian-American with Sikh heritage, and her parents immigrated from India. A Haley campaign spokeswoman criticized the remarks as targeting her ethnicity. Harpootlian's remarks were condemned as racist or xenophobic by Indian news outlets India Today, Firstpost, and Outlook. Harpootlian later apologized, claiming that he did not intend to target her ethnicity and that he wanted her to \\"go back to being an accountant in a dress store rather than being this fraud of a governor that we have\\". On February 5, 2020 Harpootlian tweeted that the Black Caucus Chairman of the South Carolina House, Jerry Govan Jr., received \\"almost $50,000\\" from the Tom Steyer Presidential campaign for campaign services. Harpootlian referred to Steyer as \\"Mr. Moneybags\\" and suggested that he had purchased Govan's support. Later that day, members of the South Carolina House Black Caucus held a press conference asking Biden to distance himself from Harpootlian. Later that day, Steyer accused Harpootlian of having \\"‚Äúa horrid track record of disrespecting and disparaging African Americans.\\" Steyer also asked Biden to disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he said during a 2020 Democratic Party presidential debate in New Hampshire. Harpootlian denied that his comments were racially motivated, State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, a Black Caucus member, noted that the press conference was not held by the caucus itself, but by Govan and his supporters; some caucus members, including Kimpson, did not participate. Kimpson, a Biden supporter, characterized the controversy as an outgrowth of personal feuds between state lawmakers.

Main characters ;: : :Shinichi is the protagonist of the manga, a thoughtful, compassionate high-school boy whose hand is infected with a Parasite and is repeatedly put into difficult positions. He must find a way to peacefully coexist with Migi, the Parasite which has taken over his hand, and reconcile his desire to protect humanity from the Parasites with his desire to keep his own Parasite a secret in order to avoid being killed or used as a laboratory specimen. Like a superhero with a secret identity, he must also find a way to explain away his Parasite-fighting activities, as well as the stress and grief they cause him, to his friends and family. While originally forced to have Migi fight for him, Shinichi later gains heightened abilities when trace cells of the Parasite course through his body, and fights his own battles, with the two having an advantage in both being able to act independently and work as a team. Shinichi's retention of his humanity, despite gradually becoming emotionally distant as a side-effect of Migi's cells, makes most of the other Parasites deem him a threat. After defeating Gotou, with Migi deciding to \\"go to sleep\\" indefinitely afterward, Shinichi attempts to live a normal life again while having an understanding of natural order from his experience, and starts dating Murano. :Masanori Harada, a 20-year-old student, wrote to the editor of the Monthly Afternoon noting that Shinichi acts calm when he is threatened and that he is \\"not human anymore!\\" Iwaaki responded, stating that Shinichi is accustomed to \\"close calls\\" partly because Migi calms Shinichi down during battle. The statement and response were printed in the April 1993 Monthly Afternoon.Iwaaki, Hitoshi (translated by Andrew Cunningham). Parasyte Volume 5. Del Rey Manga. P. 181 :Shinichi is portrayed by Shota Sometani in the film. ; : :Migi is the Parasite which lives in Shinichi's right hand, named after the Japanese word for . Unlike \\"successful\\" Parasites, Migi has no desire to kill humans for sustenance, and is nourished by the food Shinichi eats. Migi is, like other Parasites, completely without emotion. His primary consideration is survival, and he has threatened (and in some cases attempted) to kill other humans who pose a threat to his and Shinichi's secrecy. When he and Shinichi were first coming to terms, he even threatened to remove Shinichi's other limbs in order to render him unable to place the two of them in danger. Migi can be reasoned with, however, and has just as much reason to be mistrustful of other Parasites as does Shinichi. On the other hand, unlike Shinichi, Migi has no inclination to place himself at risk in order to protect other humans from Parasites. But Migi gradually evolves over the course of the series, he becomes more human while able to temporarily separate from Shinichi's body. After the final battle with Gotou, having been absorbed by the Parasite prior to his defeat, Migi's composition is greatly altered to the point that enters a deep sleep though he briefly woke up to save Satomi without Shinichi's realization. :Iwaaki explained that while Migi appears to be Shinichi's weapon, in fact Migi is in control of the battle and orders around Shinichi. Iwaaki explained that Migi is easily able to order Shinichi since Shinichi is young and \\"needs guidance\\", while Migi would find difficulty if he became a part of a politician or a president of a company since in that scenario Migi and his host would argue a lot. :An 18-year-old from Saitama Prefecture named \\"Midari\\" asked in the letters to the editor that if Migi took Shinichi's left hand, if he would have been named \\"Hidari\\". Iwaaki answered that it would be Hidari, but Iwaaki felt that the name would be similar to those of Bokuzen Hidari or Tenpei Hidari and the name would \\"bring to mind a doddering old man, so that wouldn't have been a good idea\\". Iwaaki then said that the first man to climb Mount Everest \\"had a name an awful lot like that...\\"Iwaaki, Hitoshi (translated by Andrew Cunningham). Parasyte Volume 5. Del Rey Manga. P. 42 :Migi is voiced by Sadao Abe in the film. Humans ; : :Shinichi's best friend and love interest. She is a thoughtful, tender-hearted young girl who cares deeply for her friends. While Satomi and Shinichi are mutually attracted towards one another, their relationship is strained to the breaking point when Shinichi‚Äôs life is thrown in turmoil by the Parasites. :From the moment she is introduced, Satomi is depicted as being romantically attracted towards Shinichi due to his kind and sensitive nature. Consequently, she is utterly grief-stricken as she watches him grow ever more cold and withdrawn over the course of the story. Despite her best efforts to find out the reason behind Shinichi‚Äôs behavior, Satomi becomes increasingly estranged from him as he desperately strives to keep her in the dark about Migi and the Parasite threat. As a result, she begins to question whether any trace of the gentle, caring boy she originally fell in love with remains. After losing nearly all hope, Satomi‚Äôs faith in Shinichi is completely restored upon witnessing him crying freely while protectively cradling Reiko‚Äôs orphaned baby in his arms. Upon learning that Shinichi is part Parasite at the end of the series, Satomi firmly proclaims this does nothing to diminish his humanity because he still regards all life as precious. :Satomi is played by Ai Hashimoto in the film. ; : :Kana is a disobedient \\"bad girl\\" who develops a crush on Shinichi. She is attracted to him because of his sensitive personality, and because she can sense something \\"different\\" about him. In reality, Kana has the inexplicable psychic ability to sense Parasites. However, her senses are not as fine tuned as those of the Parasites themselves. Kana mistakes this sense as a psychic connection to Shinichi; foolishly believing it was fate leading her to her true love. This ability is eventually what leads to her death when she is told about the Parasites, and a total breakdown of Shinichi for a good volume or so, until he recovers from it; the after effects of this led to estranging him from his friends and get police to keep an eye on him, all of which last until near the final volume. ; : :One of Satomi's two best friends. Her brother works as a criminal profiling illustrator for the police department. Due to her seeing her brother's sketches of Parasites and her crush on Hideo Shimada, she ended up at the center of a highly dangerous situation. ; : :The other of Satomi's two best friends, who has a minor crush on Shinichi. ; : :A cannibalistic serial killer who has the ability to distinguish between humans and Parasites, believing himself to be the definition of human nature and able to point out a killer. He is brought in by the military to help them in their operation to exterminate the Parasites in East Fukuyama City, but escapes when the military unit is slaughtered by Gotou. He returns at the end of the series, taking Satomi hostage to confront Shinichi to see if he has the same world views as he does. :Uragami is played by Hirofumi Arai in the film. ; : :Kazuyuki is Shinichi's father. Shortly after his wife was killed by a Parasite, he had some suspicions as to whether or not Shinichi was infected (although he never said so outright). ; : :Nobuko is Shinichi's mother, expressing concern over her son's strange behavior. She dies early on when she is decapitated by a Parasite that needed a compatible body to transfer to when her male replacement body started to reject her. As the Parasite assumed Nobuko's appearance, Shinichi let himself open and got himself nearly killed in the initial encounter. But Shinichi later manages to avenge his mother's death and kills the Parasite with Uda's help. :Nobuko is played by Kimiko Yo in the film. ; : :One of Shinichi's classmates at high school. He had a crush on Murano and therefore was jealous of Shinichi, beating him up outside the gym in the anime. After Shinichi intervened while he was being jumped by Mitsuo's gang, he's changed his demeanor. Nagai is quick to jump into situations as seen when he got in Shimada's face for confronting Shinichi. The scene where Nagai assaults Shinichi after gym class, originally involved a character called Kotani. Due to Kotani being omitted from the Parasyte -the maxim- anime series, the scene was transferred to Nagai. ; : : A student from Kana's school and possibly her ex-boyfriend, he is jealous about his ex-girlfriend's (Kana) crush which is Shinichi. ; : :Makiko is a young schoolgirl who lives with her parents, grandfather, and younger brother in the small town where Shinichi's father is hospitalized. Her family owns a hotel in the town where Shinichi stays for a few days, in order to be near his father. It is shown in the series that she develops a crush on Shinichi during his stay. ; : :Uda is, like Shinichi, a human who had a Parasite merged with a part of his body other than his brain. In Uda's case, the Parasite took over the lower part of his head and face, most notably his jaw. Uda's Parasite originally does not have a name, but is later renamed (). It is brash and crude, seemingly having a sense of humor, and often assumes control of Uda's mouth, distorting it into odd shapes and forcing Uda to say strange or inappropriate things. The pair befriend Shinichi and Migi, but preferring to simply avoid Parasites. Because Uda is slightly overweight and his Parasite is located in the jaw area, fights with other Parasites tend to leave him out of breath. However, because it is located in the lower part of the head, his Parasite can extend itself downward into his chest, protecting his heart (a primary target for hostile Parasites). Uda is a peaceful, easygoing man, but is shown to be nervous under pressure and highly emotional, often crying easily. He works as a hotel employee. ; : :A private investigator hired by Reiko to spy on Shinichi and caught by Migi when he takes picture of them. When his assistant Abe goes missing, Shiro asks Shinichi to find him, and ends up recording a fight between Shinichi and a Parasite. Later his family is killed by Parasites, and in a frenzy of grief he kidnaps Reiko's infant son, leading to a critical confrontation at a park. ; : : The ringleader of a Parasite conspiracy to conquer humanity and the main antagonist of the latter half of the series. In order to realize his vision of culling the human race for the planet's well-being, he lends his resources and political acumen to unite the Parasites and transform the chaotic \\"Mincemeat Murders\\" into a streamlined process of mass slaughter. Aside from his professed environmentalism and his deep-rooted hatred of humanity, nothing is revealed about his character or background. :Mid-way through the series, Hirokawa is elected mayor of East Fukuyama City, a municipality near Shinichi's hometown. Subsequently, he uses his authority to set up safehouses where the Parasites can kill and eat humans with impunity. After Shinichi and Migi disrupt the operation of one of these facilities, Hirokawa targets them for elimination. Eventually, he and most of the Parasites comprising his organization are killed by a police taskforce once their plans are uncovered by the authorities. ; : :A veteran detective who first suspected Shinichi for Kana's death. ; : :A police officer assigned to the Parasyte Extermination Squad, who is eventually beheaded by Gotou. ; : :An old woman who gave shelter to Shinichi after his fight with Gotou in the forest. After staying for a while, he left to have the final confrontation with Gotou. Parasites The antagonists of the series. The Parasites are creatures of unknown origin which start off as worm-like creatures that instinctively enter the body of the nearest life form and travel to the brain to completely assimilate it while destroying the host's identity in the process. From there, using the vital organs of the host bodies to survive, the Parasites would be driven with a need to kill humans and Parasites with failed host bodies. After assimilating their host, Parasites exhibit a variety of abilities that make them dangerous adversaries: the immediate area around their entry site (typically the head) is morphed into a versatile \\"parasite tissue\\" which can take a variety of offensive and defensive forms, and a parasite that successfully takes over a host's brain can then maximize the physical potential of that host. In general, Parasite intelligence is comparable to humans, though their thought process is strictly rational and cold, with very little emotion. They are also capable of learning extremely quickly depending on their environment ‚Äì Migi, for example, mastered Japanese after one night of reading books on the subject. While most Parasites initially acted alone, causing a chain of multiple grisly deaths coined the \\"mincemeat murders\\", they eventually form groups for safety in numbers. By the time of the final chapter, Shinichi speculating that they might have been created as an evolutionary countermeasure to humans, the surviving Parasites are assumed to have gone into hiding and adopt themselves further into human society to keep their activities to a minimum. ; : :An extremely intelligent, ruthless Parasite and the main antagonist of the story's first half. She originally infected and took on the identity of a woman named , one of Shinichi's high school teachers. Unlike most of her kind, she is motivated by scientific inclinations with a drive to understand her kind's biology, origin, and purpose. She learned that she is pregnant with a normal human infant as a consequence of being impregnated by Mr. A, deeming it interesting while forced to quit to avoid unwanted attention resulting from it. Though she intended to kill Shinichi soon after, she lets him and Migi live unmolested largely because she finds them an interesting anomaly worthy of study. After killing off Ry≈çko's parents when they saw through her, the Parasite alters her face and creates the identity of \\"Reiko Tamura\\" while aligning herself with Takeshi Hirokawa. She eventually gives birth to Mr. A's baby and later kills three of her fellow Parasites when they deemed her actions with a hired detective a threat to their plans. It was after Reiko killed the maddened detective to save her child that she allowed the police to brutally gun her down in a park instead of trying to resist or escape. The baby survives because of her protection and decision not to fight back against or run away from the police. :Tamura is portrayed by Eri Fukatsu in the film. ; : :A Parasite who attacks Shinichi and tries to coerce Migi into relocating to his arm in order to extend his own lifespan. To his surprise, Migi kills him on the pretense that relocation is too risky to try. ; : : An highly aggressive Parasite aligned with Reiko Tamura. When first introduced, he (or rather, his host body) fathers a child with Reiko as part of the latter's experiment. Described by Migi as \\"not one of our smart ones\\" and called a fool by Reiko, Mr. A is extremely impulsive and animalistic. He has little capacity for caution or forethought as evidenced when he butchers several people in the presence of witnesses without hesitation. Shinichi is forced to battle Mr. A when he attempts to hunt Shinichi down and kill him at school. Though Shinichi and Migi mortally wound him, they are forced to flee before they can kill him. Mr. A attempts to find Reiko to transfer himself to her body and survive, but she rigs the room to explode to completely destroy him to preserve her human cover. ; : :A Parasite with the body of a young adult and a major antagonist. On Reiko's suggestion, Hideo enrolls in Shinichi's high school to monitor his activities. Despite being one of the more pragmatic of his species, he has no qualms feeding on humans or otherwise killing them if they annoy or threaten to expose him. Ultimately, his single-minded desire to preserve his cover at any cost lead him to become a direct threat to Shinichi's loved ones. :When first introduced, Hideo Shimada is asked by Reiko to monitor Shinichi in order to confirm he poses no threat to their kind. Subsequently, Hideo enrolls in Shinichi's high school and expresses a desire to become friends with Shinichi, who does not trust him. Despite professing a willingness to peacefully coexist with humanity, he nearly kills a group of bullies who try to start fights with him, and continues to prey on humans. When Yuko uncovered his secret and confronts him about it, Hideo attempts to kill her only for Yuko to escape by dousing him in paint-thinner. The paint-thinner's chemical make-up disrupts Hideo's Parasite cells, causing him to go on an involuntary killing spree across the school. He is killed after he escapes to the roof, when Shinichi, using Migi to enhance his right arm's strength, throws a well-aimed stone through his chest, destroying his heart. :Shimada is played by Masahiro Higashide in the film. ; : : The strongest Parasite and one of the series' primary antagonists. His host body contains 4 additional Parasites that are completely under his control. Since most of his body mass is parasite tissue, he can achieve feats of strength and agility far in excess of normal parasites and render nearly every inch of his skin impervious to gunfire and edged weapons. Despite being one of the more intelligent of his kind, Gotou is also one of the most violent. Whereas most Parasites kill humans to feed or eliminate threats, he often hunts them sheerly for sport. Nonetheless, Gotou does possess his own peculiar code of honor as seen when he commends opponents for getting past his defenses and seeks vengeance against Shinichi for his role in his comrades‚Äô massacre at East Fukuyama City Hall. The name \\"Got≈ç\\" is a pun as one of the kanji is synonymous with the kanji for , a reference to how 5 Parasites inhabit his host.Iwaaki, Hitoshi (translated by Andrew Cunningham). Parasyte Volume 5. Del Rey Manga. P. 290 :Gotou is introduced as the chief enforcer and right-hand man of Takeshi Hirokawa, the leader of a Parasite conspiracy to conquer humanity. After Shinichi and Migi attack one of his organization‚Äôs \\"dining areas\\", Gotou is tasked with eliminating them. Despite easily overwhelming the two in combat, they narrowly manage to escape. Later, when Hirokawa and his group are killed in an SAT operation, Gotou singlehandedly wipes out most of the attacking police forces before once again targeting Shinichi and Migi. During their rematch, Gotou absorbs Migi after the latter sacrifices himself so Shinichi can retreat. During the story‚Äôs climax, Shinichi poisons him by stabbing one of his few vulnerable areas with a pipe contaminated with toxins. As a result, Gotou loses control of the other Parasites in his body thereby enabling Migi to break free and help Shinichi finally defeat him. ; : : One of the Parasites that composes Gotou's body. Similar to \\"Migi\\", Miki's default position in the body is the right arm. His name has an additional meaning, which means \\"Three trees\\", referencing how he is only able to manipulate 3 Parasites in the body (including himself) when he takes the head position. Unlike other Parasites, Miki has learned to show emotions just like humans. His body is composed of five Parasites, one in each of his arms and legs and another in his head, they can apparently swap their places in the body but only two of them are able to unify the five and make them fight as a single being. ; : :A Parasite that allied himself with Reiko Tamura along with two others named \\"Hikawa\\" and \\"Maesawa.\\" He later grows distrustful of Reiko Tamura when she argues against the notion of killing Shinichi despite the threat he poses to them.

It represents the most expensive investment of the Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority ever, with a total cost that could be as high as 392 million Euros. It is the second most expensive infrastructure project in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, behind the coming extension of the Western Metro. The plant will clean sewage from some 400,000 local residents from Espoo, Kauniainen, Vihti, Siuntio and western Vantaa. In the future, its operations could be enlarged, so that it could process the sewage of a million residents. The sewage to be cleaned will first flow to the Suomenoja sewage treatment plant, and from there it is pumped through pipelines for eight kilometers to the northwest of the Ring III highway, to Blominm√§ki, for the cleaning process. After the sewage is cleaned, it flows on its own weight back to Suomenoja, and from there it will be pumped to the Gulf of Finland where it will flow into the sea at a distance of 15 kilometres from the shore. The sewage thus moves back and forth in Espoo, and the reason for this is that it would be too expensive to rebuild all the pipeline systems in Espoo. It was not possible to plan the plant closer to Suomenoja due to a great resistance of local residents in the area. The technology used in the plant is much the same as in other such plants in Finland, and the performance of this technology is well known. Some new technology will be used at the end of the process, and this includes the filtering of phosphorus with special discs. It is claimed that 96% of the phosphorus can be cleaned this way. 90% of the nitrogen will also be cleaned by the plant. The plant also produces sludge and biogas, and the plant will be heated with the help of the latter. It is also possible that the plant will be self-sufficient with regard to electricity. The sludge will decompose in 35¬∞ Celsius. There will be four tubs for the anaerobic digestion process, and they have been mined into the bedrock. The tubs are 25 metres high and their volume is 6,000 cubic metres. A propeller stirs the sludge to enable a smooth process. The sludge will be ready in 3‚Äì4 weeks, after which it will be transported to the √Ñmm√§ssuo Waste Treatment Plant, where it will be allowed to compost. The output will be 250,000 tons of dried sludge per year. The liquids from the sludge will be processed in Blominm√§ki. In order to minimize the smell nuisance, the pipe of the plant will be 100 metres tall.

Okeley published his narrative in 1675, nearly 30 years after escaping and returning home to England. Okeley was fleeing religious persecution and was on his way to the Puritan colony of Providence Island when his boat was captured by Algerian pirates. During his time in Algiers, he served 4 different masters, and was forced into a variety of occupations, including childcare, working on the crew of an Algerian pirate ship, weaving, and, most importantly, running a business in the city selling alcohol and other goods. Many slaves in Algiers were set loose within the city (whose walls acted as a prison) and forced to pay a monthly allowance to their masters. Many, like Okeley, thrived by trading. Eventually, Okeley and a group of English slaves staged a daring escape by creating a boat with a canvas hull, smuggling it out of the city, and rowing themselves across the Mediterranean to the island of Mayork. Unlike many Barbary slave narratives, Okeley constructed his in the form of a spiritual autobiography, and his narrative provides an important precursor to, and possible inspiration for, American Puritan captivity narratives, including the most well-known, that of Mary Rowlandson, who was captured by Native Americans in colonial Massachusetts during King Phillip's War.  Providence Island and Colonization  Providence Island is a small island located in the West Indies. The island promised land for Puritans wanting to leave New England under the reign of Charles I. New England was overpopulated and restricted Puritan practice under the Church of England. The land was beneficial for Puritan colonies to practice their religion without restriction, and supplied fertile soil for growing cotton and tobacco. Labor of the land was relied on the African slaves that were either imported from New England, or captured. \\"Slavery and colonization went hand in hand. Without colonies to grow staple crops lie sugar, rice, and tobacco, and to proffer wealth in the form of valuable minerals, their would have been much less need for slave. Without Indian and African slaves, there would have been no labor to grow the crops or extract those minerals--at least not labor cost-efficient enough to create the profits that made the whole system viable.\\"  Puritans and Slavery  Permanent servitude is described as a \\"natural hierarchy\\" Puritans believed to be \\"the bottom rung of a ladder that led all the way up to God.\\" \\"The Curse of Ham is the assumed biblical justification for a curse of eternal slavery imposed on Black people, and Black people alone.\\" Even though the Bible does not specifically describe certain race, such justification of Black slavery is strongly associated with the Curse of Ham: \\"The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Ham was the father of Canaan. These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled. Noah was the first tiller of the soil. He planted a vineyard; and he drank the wine, and became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brother outside. Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it upon both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness. When Noah awake from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him, he said, \\"Cursed be Canaan; a lave of slaves shall he be to his brothers.\\" Ham son, Canaan, is cursed for his father's sin. Even though, Noah did not curse Ham and chose to curse Canaan, still effects the descendants of Ham. \\"The spirit of prophecy would not curse the son that had been by God blessed along with [his brothers]. But since the punishment of the sin would cleave to the whole descent of the son that mocked at his father's nakedness, he made the curse originate with his son.\\"  Slavery and Psychological Trauma  In the 17th century the Barbary Coast implemented a system to force captives, like Okeley, into slavery. After being captured, the captives were either locked below deck or put to work by the corsairs. These captives were beaten, lacked food and water, and lived in unsanitary conditions. When the captive and corsairs arrived to their respective territories, the corsairs paraded the captives through the town. Residents of the town, Turks, Moors, Jews and renegades cheered and taunted as the captives and corsairs walked. For the corsairs, they were celebrating their new booty. The captives were humiliated and ashamed of their new status. The captives were in shock from the reversal of their fortunes. Also, the captives were sometimes sent to the wealthy slave dealers or government officials to be introduced to older slaves. The older slaves shared information about society and servitude in the Barbary Coast. They helped the newcomers understand lingua franca and lent them money. Also, they provided information about social customs like, kissing the hem of their master's robe. The veteran slaves helped the captives become less susceptible to anxiety or depression from these new experiences. However, these veterans were employed by their masters to gain information about the captives to demand higher sale prices or ransoms in the slave market. Okeley recounts his experience at the slave market in his narrative. Okeley compares his experience to a slaughterhouse because he is treated like a beast. The maquignons (horse traders) inspect the captives by looking at their teeth, limbs, hair, beard, and face. They inspect these body parts to determine if the captives are fit for labor. They inspect the limbs for any broken bones, dislocation, or any bone disease that are commonly found in horses. The maquigonins could not judge the age of the captives effectively. Age was important because, for a male slave it determines their work-ability and for a female if she is worth buying as a consort for a harem. Okeley's description is an example of dehumanization. The captives are treated like beast because they are inspected like horses by horse traders. This is the first of many of Okeley's traumatic experiences while captured in Algiers. While enslaved in Algiers, Okeley is accused of attempting to escape by a spy. The spy sees Okeley near the shore with John Randal, another slave, and assumes they are planning an escape. Okeley and Randal were charged by the viceroy and his council with an attempt to escape. They were beaten with the batoon. Afterwards, they were chained and locked away in the viceroy's prison until their patrons came to receive them. After being delivered by his patron, Randal was given three hundred blows upon his feet. The spy that seized them demanded a payment from Okeley's patron. Okeley's patron ordered him to work in the looms. After Okeley is sold to his second patron, he begins a plan to escape. While he is preparing a sail for the boat, Okeley notices the spy that accused him of attempted escape. Okeley becomes anxious and begins to panic because he knows if he is caught and pleads guilty, he will face punishment. Slaves can roam the town without their patrons. However, a spy system is implemented to force the slaves to comply. This is an example of the psychological coercive method called, monopolization of perception. The perpetrators limit their victims understanding of the world by monopolizing their attention. The spy system limits Okeley's perception and understanding of his new world. Okeley is constantly being watched which, causes anxiety.

The film serves as a prequel-cum-sequel to the 2010 film Dabangg and 2012 film Dabangg 2, and is the third installment of the Dabangg film series. The screenplay of the film is written by Salman Khan, Prabhu Deva, and Alok Upadhyaye. The story, written by Salman Khan, is set in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The film features Salman Khan, Sonakshi Sinha,and Arbaaz Khan reprising their roles from the previous film, along with Sudeep as the antagonist and Saiee Manjrekar in her Bollywood debut. Set after the events of Dabangg 2, the film showcases Chulbul Pandey's origin as a police officer, after his encounter with an old rival named Bali Singh refreshes his memory. Along with dubbed versions in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu languages, the film was theatrically released in India on 20 December 2019. It opened to mixed reviews from critics who praised Khan and Sudeep's performances while others found it formulaic and weaker as compared to the prequels. At the box office, the film's collections were further affected by the CAA protests, making it the second lowest- grossing film in the franchise. Plot Starting off again with a heroic antic, the story moves ahead from Dabangg 2 with the corrupt yet much loved cop, ASP Chulbul Pandey, preventing a robbery at a wedding, and beating the goons and their leader, Gullu, black and blue. Gullu then agrees to return to his former part-time job as a wedding band trumpeter, and Chulbul is seen dealing with the everyday lives of his wife Rajjo, brother Makhanchand \\"Makkhi\\" Pandey, also a police officer, and his son, while his father Prajapati Pandey stays at home with Rajjo. Makkhi appears to be enjoying a lavish lifestyle most of the times. One fateful day, a despaired girl, probably injured, arrives in a hurry at Makkhi's station after escaping from somewhere, and seeks help; Makkhi, expecting to punish her captors, who tried to sell her and other girls off, is joined by Chulbul, and after a scuffle, the brothers arrest Chinti Walia, who runs a prostitution racket. While trying to force a confession out of Chinti at the police station, Chulbul intercepts a lawyer and some goons who have come over to have Chinti released, but he tears off the court order, and in desperation, the leader of the goons keeps his video call going on even as Chulbul smiles into the screen. Minutes later, the leader shows the video call to Bali Singh, who sees Chulbul, who in turns looks back into the phone camera to see Bali. Shocked beyond words, he reminisces his younger days, recalling his fate with Bali. Years ago, when he was still young, Chulbul, whose real name turns out to be Dhaakad Chand Pandey, fell in love with a girl, Khushi, who was initially being considered as a potential bride for Makkhi, after he noticed a photo of her in Makkhi's hand, and told his mother, Naini Devi, that he would be a good fit instead of Makkhi; a few days later, Khushi's maternal uncle Prabhat and maternal aunt Janki agreed to the match between Dhaakad and Khushi, and the two began courting each other. At the same time, Bali, a ruthless and violent goon, set his eyes on Khushi and began making arrangements for his marriage with her. However, the moment he saw Dhaakad with Khushi, he decided to kill Khushi and her family right in front of Dhaakad's eyes after luring him to the spot. Prabhat and Janki were both killed, and Khushi was thrown off a cliff to die. Consequently, both Khushi's uncle Hariya and his daughter Rajjo, revealed to be Khushi's friend, were deeply affected; Hariya took to alcoholism, while Dhaakad, who was framed by Bali and spent much time in prison for the deaths, was taken in by Commissioner Singh after saving him from attackers, and transformed into an uptight cop, naming himself Chulbul, in Khushi's memory, forming the events of Dabangg. At present, Chulbul, having relayed this entire episode to Prajapati and Rajjo, decides that he has had enough, and he needs to close the chapter once and for good. Meanwhile, an ill-attracted Makkhi is misled by Bali into turning against Chulbul, nearly so as to slap him after he too is promoted to the rank of ASP. The action causes him to be banished from home by Prajapati, and he joins hands with Bali actively. Bali, who is set to become a politician and a minister in the upcoming elections, plans to bring in a truck filled with money, and thus gets Makkhi and many other policemen in his circle transferred to one common location in order to facilitate the transportation. Chulbul, however, intercepts the truck and turns Bali's moles in the police force against Bali himself. As revenge, Bali gets several of Chulbul's associates kidnapped and brutally beaten to near death, until Chulbul breaks in again and frees them all, even when Bali has run away with Makkhi and some reliable accomplices. Seeking to lure Bali into counterproductive action, Chulbul kidnaps Minister S. S. Sharma and his brother-in-law by staging a ploy with Gullu's help, and forces a confession out of them, which is made viral. Bali notices the same and Makkhi helps him track them down since he recognizes the hideout. Upon arriving there, Bali kills Sharma and injures his brother-in-law; in retaliation, he sends wrestlers to attack Rajjo and her son, but Chulbul arrives in time to save the two. Some time later, Chulbul receives a call from Prajapati, who tells him that Rajjo hasn't arrived home. Sensing Bali's hand in the matter, he invades a quarry where Bali has held Rajjo, and surprisingly, Makkhi himself, as hostages ‚Äì Makkhi was always on Chulbul's side and it was a game by the brothers to incense Bali; after an intense confrontation, Chulbul kills Bali.

He popularized passenger flight in Hawaii and became the head of the Chinese air force.  Early life  Gunn was born in San Francisco on October 13, 1890. He had at least three sisters and at least one brother. He attended the Oakland Polytechnic High School (also known as Central High School). There, he took classes in engineering and met his future fianc√©, Lily Tong.  Aviation career  = Training and First Flight = Gunn was mentored by aviators Lincoln Beachey at the Curtiss School in Hammondsport, NY, Warren S. Eaton, Horace Kearney, and Glen Martin. His nephew, Curtis Joe, recalled hearing that Gunn had learned to fly in Los Angeles and San Diego. On February 19, 1912, Gunn made his first public flight at the international aviation meet in Emeryville, California. The San Francisco Examiner reported that hundreds from San Francisco's Chinese- American community turned out to see him. Beachey and other pilots were apprehensive because Gunn was relatively inexperienced, but he landed safely. = Emeryville Crash = On February 22, 1912, Gunn's plane crashed at the Emeryville meet, dropping 150 feet to the ground. The plane was destroyed, and the building it crashed into was badly damaged. Gunn's manager, Warren S. Eaton, said the accident was due to the plane's motor stalling. The San Francisco Examiner reported that Gunn fell from a height of several hundred feet, saying \\"that he was not killed outright is little short of marvelous.\\" Gunn's jaw was dislocated and his body was covered in severe lacerations. He was taken to the Oakland Central Hospital, where his doctor described his chance of recovery as good. = Travels and Death = Gunn officially received his pilot's license on June 19, 1912. On August 4, 1912, Gunn demonstrated his flying skills for three of Chinese president Sun Yat-sen's children and General Lan Tien Wei. After watching Gunn make four flights around the airfield, Wei went for a ride in Gunn's plane. Wei \\"expressed himself as delighted with the experience\\" upon landing, and recommended that the Chinese government recruit Gunn as a pilot. In May 1913, Gunn and Lily Tong announced their engagement. Gunn left San Francisco for China in June 1913, but promised to return for Tong at the end of eight months. On June 10, 1913, Gunn arrived in Honolulu, where he planned to stay for a month before traveling to China. On July 13, 1913, in front of a crowd of thousands, he carried his first Hawaiian passengers. Gunn had been offered a commission as a captain in the Chinese army, though he intended to spend his first six months in the country making freelance exhibition flights. However, new president Yuan Shikai, fearing that Gunn intended to side with his political rivals, put a bounty of 5,000 dollars on his head. Gunn traveled to the Philippines instead, where he was credited with introducing air mail. By 1913, Gunn had built six different types of plane. He preferred to fly planes he had made himself, explaining that \\"I always understand a machine I build myself much better.\\" Gunn died in a rickshaw accident in China in 1925. There is speculation that his death may have been an assassination in disguise.

There, Matilda is also reunited with her three crime novelist aunts Cat, Beth, and Jane, played by Julie Graham, Sarah Woodward, and Siobhan Redmond. The first season comprises three separate stories, each split into two 45-minute episodes. Queens of Mystery is Acorn TV's second entirely original production. Cast = Guest stars = Production Julie Graham was attracted to the script's portrayal of older women, explaining that \\"Cat, Jane, and Beth... are all in their fifties... it was a joy to see scenes about authentic females in a family. It's unusual and it's important and of this moment,\\" while Olivia Vinall said the series \\"feels really truthful [about] the way the women behave.\\" Graham also called Queens of Mystery \\"very tongue-in-cheek and cartoonish.\\" Filming for the first season took place in Kent, specifically in Stone Street in Cranbrook. Production used Lympne Castle as Hiddledean Castle in the fictional town of Wildemarsh in the Murder In The Dark episode. The series visited several locations in Farningham, Beth‚Äôs cottage was filmed at Mill Estate. Wadard Books doubled as Murder Inc. bookshop and Jane‚Äôs house. Farningham Village Store also featured as Wildemarsh Village stores and the Entrance to The Corn Exchange Theatre. In the Death By Vinyl episode Stoneydale craft shop in Cranbrook was converted into The Sound and Fury record shop. Cranbrook also features as the High street throughout the series. St Michael's Churchyard in Smarden was used as the Wildemarsh churchyard and a private residence in Water Lane featured as the village's Embittered Hack Pub. The police station is filmed at the old school building in Benenden, alongside the village green and church in the backdrop. Beyond the first season, Queens of Mystery creator and showrunner Julian Unthank has plans for future story arcs.

The neighbouring countries of The United States and Cuba rushed to provide immediate aid by plane to victims of the disaster.  Meteorological Causes  A range of factors played roles in the cause of the 1949 Eastern Guatemala floods, however the most prominent was a violent storm, originating from the 1949 Texas Hurricane, which was one of the last tropical cyclones of the years‚Äô season. Since the introduction of reliable storm records in 1851, the hurricane is one of only eighteen to have developed in the Pacific Ocean and move into the Atlantic Ocean, or vice versa. Records show that some winds of the hurricane reached a peak of 177 km/h (110 mph), equivalent to high Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The storm moved ashore the Texas coast with a barometric pressure estimated at 965 millibars (28.5 inHg). Modern day analysis attributes the origins of this hurricane to a tropical depression that developed in the Pacific Ocean, drifting northwestward until making landfall in Guatemala in late September.\\"Atlantic hurricane best track (HURDAT version 2)\\".

Accessed 31 March 2019. http://thinkhazard.org/en/report/103-guatemala Guatemala has high disaster risks associated with several categories including river, urban and coastal floods, and tsunamis. This data indicates that potentially harmful and life- threatening floods are expected to occur at least once a decade. Similarly, Guatemala is ranked amongst the top five countries most affected by floods, with 40.8%Climate Change Knowledge Portal, World Bank Group. Accessed 31 March 2019. https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/guatemala of the population affected by five or more hazards. Guatemala's risk of cyclone is also ranked as high, indicating there is a 20 percent chance that infrastructure damaging wind speeds are likely to occur in the next 20 years. The countries placement, between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean makes it a particular target for hurricanes and other tropical cyclones, however most of the damage that occurs in this region is due to the flooding and landslides that result from these hurricanes, rather than the winds 80.3% of the country's gross domestic product is located in high risk areas. Consequently, the hazardous location of Guatemala can be taken into account as a factor into the cause and deadly nature of the 1949 flood.  Death Toll, Damage and Recovery  The estimated number of people affected by the disaster varies widely amongst sources. At the time of the floods, the government placed this number at a maximum of 20,000 people, while news sources reported around 100,000Madera Tribune, Volume 17, Number 91, 19 October 1949.

The death toll at the time of the event was estimated by the Government at around 1000 people, however, modern day analysis suggests that around 40,000 people were killed by the flooding. The American Ambassador in Guatemala, in a telegram to the U.S, outlined some of the ambiguity concerning the death toll at the time of the event. > \\"My impression based upon three-day intensive survey including long flight > over affected areas, talks with President Ar√©valo, other government > officials and representative businessmen, is that devastation and loss life > result floods exaggerated by press (encouraged intentionally or > unintentionally by government), that immediate relief needs well in hand, > but that country suffered heavily economically and government confronted > serious long-range financial problem respecting rehabilitation.‚Äù A reported emergency period of 30‚Äì60 days immediately followed the disaster, directly affecting the 260,000 inhabitants of Guatemala at the time. Unlike many other great floods of the world, no widespread epidemics were reported.  Social, Economical and Financial impacts  Apart from the direct deadly consequences of the floods, the disaster had a huge impact in many other spheres of life in Guatemala. It is estimated that the financial consequences of the floods ranged from $15,000,000 to $40,000,000. A quote from the US ambassador in Guatemala detailed the long term financial effects of the floods; > ‚ÄúThe chief problem confronting the Government, however, is long range > financing, since foreign exchange holdings will be diminished and Government > spending increased at a time when a budget deficit is in prospect‚Äù. Reports from the U.S embassy stated that flood water had covered miles of low roads, highways, and crop fields. Economically, one source reported that much of Guatemala's infrastructure had been destroyed in the disaster, and widespread damage had been caused to a number of cities. > ‚ÄúMore than fifty bridges and 1,200 miles of highways were destroyed. Rivers > changed their course. Some towns, such as San Juan Osculcalco, were reported > destroyed by landslides\\". Another source detailed the devastation the flood had on one town in particular. The mudslides caused by the flooding in Tzununa stripped hillsides bare and covered much of the town with mud and rock, requiring much of the town's housing and residential centre to be relocated to higher, safer ground.E. Hinshaw, R. (2006). Quick Response Report. Hurricane Stan Response in Guatemala. Natural Hazards Centre. Available at: https://hazards.colorado.edu/archive/research/qr/qr182/qr182.pdf The towns of Escuintla, San Marcos, Quezaltenango, Jalapa, Santa Rosa, Jutiapa and Sacatepequez were also some of the worst affected by the flooding, many of which required extensive repairs and aid. Landslides and road blockages affected communications within the country, and also impacted distribution of foods and other resources. Apart from this, Guatemala also sustained agricultural damage to two of the countries chief crop exports, coffee and banana crops, which suffered losses of ten and twenty percent respectively. Many other crop losses, including corn, beans and rice were sustained, along with considerable losses in the livestock sector.  Foreign Aid  As news of the floodings in Guatemala broke international headlines, Foreign governments pledged aid to the recovery of the country accordingly. The neighbouring countries of The United States and Cuba rushed to provide immediate aid by plane to victims of the disaster. The Israel Government gifted $10,000 to Guatemalan Foreign Minister Ismal Gonzalez Arevalo, to be used for relief of flood victims in Guatemala. The Guatemalan Government also requested an immediate grant of $2,000,000 from American Congress to begin implementing rescue and relief work and reported an immediate need for clothing, medicine, and other relief supplies. The U.S embassy reported that relief supplies and a Red Cross expert had been flown from Panama, as well as an amphibian plane to rescue stranded American tourists. Medical supplies, food and water were also being distributed by the Guatemalan military and private planes to isolated villages and towns. > ‚ÄúThree planes left here early today to carry aid to the flood victims of > Guatemala. The group of relief workers who carried first aid to the > sufferers of the recent earthquake in Ecuador went along. One amphibian > plane will attempt a landing on Lake Atitl√°n, in the Guatemalan mountains, > to determine the possibility of evacuating the Indian inhabitants from > villages on the lake shore‚Äù. Guatemala's aid relationship with the US and other international organisations has been extensive in the past, and has helped to develop the countries economic and political environment. However, foreign aid is only effective under the assumption that the recipient government is willing and dedicated to the wellbeing of the citizens. An audit in 1984 revealed that ten out of ten aid projects in Guatemala suffered major delays, and did not fulfil their planned objectives.Agency for International Development, Local Conditions Beyond AID's Control and Repeated Design, Planning and Monitoring Deficiencies Have Seriously Delayed the Implementation of Projects by USAID/Guatemala (Washington, May 23, 1984), p. 5. Similarly, the motives behind US foreign aid are sometimes questioned, as to whether America's aid is simply an investment returning in furthering the countries interests and western ideologies.

The temple also lacked both porch and adyton, and the lack of a triglyph and metope frieze may be indicative of Ionian influence. The temple at Kardaki is considered an important and to a certain degree mysterious topic on the subject of early ancient Greek architecture. Its association with the worship of Apollo or Poseidon has not been established. Location Kardaki Temple The temple lies on the grounds of Mon Repos, a former residence of the Greek royal family built on the site of Palaiopolis, the original site of ancient Korkyra. The temple lies close to and to the southeast of the Temple of Hera (Heraion), which in turn is approximately 700 m. to the southeast of the Temple of Artemis. The site is known as Kardaki, or \\"Cada[c]chio\\" in Italian. Discovery A column at the Kardaki Temple The temple was discovered accidentally in 1822, during the British protectorate, by British engineers performing excavations to free the flow of the natural water emanating from the spring at Kardaki; the British navy depended on the water of the spring for its supplies, and, at the time, the flow of water was impeded by soil accumulation around the spring. As the engineers were removing the soil, they discovered a Doric column lying on the ground. The engineers then unearthed the rest of the temple, and they also discovered pottery in the shape of female heads and a leg. These terracota artefacts are thought to be either votive offerings or toys left at the tomb of a child. Following its discovery, the temple disappeared from view again, after a landslide from Analipsi hill covered it with soil. In 1825, it was excavated again, and William Railton documented the site and published the results in his paper Antiquities of Athens and other Places in Greece, Sicily etc. Railton's work was published in a later edition of a famous work by Stuart and Revett. In 1830, Railton also illustrated a book titled The Newly Discovered Temple of Cadachio, in the Island of Corfu. The eastern boundary of the temple has collapsed and slid into the surrounding sea and has been underwater for a long time. The temple at Kardaki, is considered an important and to a certain degree mysterious topic on the subject of early ancient Greek architecture. Early studies column capital geometric profile and elevation detail: Projection of the capital oval from the inclined position it occupied onto a plane parallel to the longitudinal column axis. For over 80 years after Railton's study there were no further archaeological examinations of the temple. In 1909, the site was visited by the archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor, who subsequently published his findings in a brief paper. In 1912‚Äì1914, German archaeologist Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld obtained permission from the King of Greece to excavate the area of the temple. D√∂rpfeld published his results in two brief notes without illustrations in the Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger. Franklin P. Johnson expanded on D√∂rpfeld's findings by adding pictures and further details, which he published in 1936 in his paper \\"The Kardaki Temple\\" with the aim \\"that this unique structure may be better known and to make some suggestions toward determining its proper place in the field of Greek architecture.\\" Architecture column capital geometric profile and elevation detail: Projection of the capital oval onto a plane perpendicular to the oval's radius of curvature, showing its true extent. According to Johnson, the architect of the temple followed the architectural traditions of Corfu and Corinth. Johnson also writes that, by omitting the frieze, the architect consciously diverged from established norms, and by doing so he showed his considerable talent. The absence of a frieze results in a lighter entablature which enables the number of supporting columns to be reduced, thus the spacing of the columns is increased. It is considered to be the only Greek temple of Doric architecture that does not have a frieze. The spacing of the temple columns has been described as \\"abnormally wide\\". The dimensions of the temple are 11.91m by 25.5m with 6 columns by 12 columns respectively. Its association with the worship of Apollo or Poseidon has not been established. The cella did not include either a porch or an adyton and the lack of a frieze may be indicative of Ionian influence. The porch may also have disappeared due to a landslide. Many of the tiles on the roof of the temple bore inscriptions of names, likely of chief magistrates who were contemporary to its construction or renovation periods. The names on the tiles included: Aristomenes, Thersia, and Damon. The temple's architectural style is hexastyle-peripteral. The period of the temple is estimated between 500 B.C. to the middle of the fifth century B.C. Kardaki Temple is the only archaic temple in Greece known to lack an epinaos, an omission similarly observed elsewhere in two temples at Selinus and Assos. Inscription Kardaki Temple inscription An inscription exists at a museum in Verona which appears to refer to the Kardaki Temple. The inscription, in Doric Greek, details works undertaken by the state of Korkyra (ancient Corfu) for the maintenance and repair of the Temple. It also accounts for the costs of the works and the prices of materials such as tin, lead and brass and the costs of transportation, labour, and excavation. Other costs included the acquisition of a brazen serpent, the construction and erection of an obelisk, and the construction of a retaining wall by a craftsman called Metrodorus. The inscription provides the official approval of the magistrates of the Corcyrean republic for carrying out these works. The inscription also mentions that the roof of the temple was removed and states that the water channels have to be diverted so that they do not damage the retaining wall. From these writings, it is shown that the location of the temple near a sacred site of a natural spring was also the cause of constant problems with water damage and continuing repair. In the inscription there is also mention of nitre, which has been interpreted as meaning natron. Colonel Whitmore, the discoverer of the temple, had commented that he had noticed traces of a substance on the altar that resembled soda.

The mountain is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Snohomish County and Chelan County, also straddling the boundary between the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and the Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Fortress Mountain, to the west. Chiwawa Mountain is a triple divide peak, so precipitation runoff from it drains northeast to Lake Chelan via Railroad Creek; northwest into Miners Creek which is a tributary of the Suiattle River; and south into the Chiwawa River headwaters. The mountain's name is taken from the river's name, which was applied by Albert Hale Sylvester (1871-1944), a pioneer surveyor, explorer, topographer, and forest supervisor in the Cascades. Chiwawa comes from the Columbia-Moses language and means a kind of creek (\\"wawa\\" creek). Geology Chiwawa Mountain is located in the Cloudy Pass batholith, an intrusive formation that was formed approximately , during the early Miocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.CLOUDY PASS BATHOLITH AND ASSOCIATED ROCKS USGS During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Remnants of the Lyman Glacier remain on the northeast slope of Chiwawa Mountain. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about 35 million years ago. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is southwest of Chiwawa Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Chiwawa Mountain, volcanic ash is common in the area. Climate Chiwawa Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W.

On 30 September Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces crossed the 38th Parallel, the de facto border between North and South Korea on the east coast of the Korean peninsula and this was followed by a general UN offensive into North Korea to pursue the shattered North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA). Within one month UN forces were approaching the Yalu River prompting Chinese intervention in the war. Despite the initial attacks by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) in late October-early November, the UN renewed their offensive on 24 November before it was abruptly halted by massive Chinese intervention in the Second Phase Offensive starting on 25 November. Following their defeats by the PVA in the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River and the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in eastern Korea, UN forces withdrew from North Korea completing their withdrawal on 25 December. UN forces then prepared new defensive lines above Seoul for an expected renewal of the PVA offensive. Background On the night of 28 November UN commander General Douglas MacArthur met with US Eighth Army commander General Walton Walker and US X Corps commander General Edward Almond in Tokyo to assess the position of UN forces. Having received updates from his ground commanders, MacArthur judged that the Eighth Army was in greater danger than the X Corps, but he wanted both commands to step back. Walker was to make whatever withdrawals were necessary to escape being enveloped. Almond was to maintain contact with the PVA but also was to pull X Corps back and concentrate it in the Hamhung-Hungnam coastal area. MacArthur next asked Almond what X Corps could do to help the Eighth Army. Almond pointed out that the isolated Marine and Army troops at the Chosin Reservoir had to be retrieved before anything else could be done. =Eighth Army front= Following their victory in the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, the PVA did not pursue the US Eighth Army's withdrawal from the Ch‚Äôongch‚Äôon to the Sukch‚Äôon-Sunch‚Äôon-Songch‚Äôon line. Only light PVA patrolling occurred along the new line on 1 December, mostly at its eastern end where there had been no deep withdrawal the day before. General Walker nevertheless believed that the PVA would soon close the gap, resume their frontal assaults, and again send forces against his east flank. Walker now estimated the PVA opposing him to number at least six armies with eighteen divisions and 165,000 men. Of his own forward units, only the US 1st Cavalry Division, 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, the ROK 1st Infantry Division and the British 27th Commonwealth Brigade and 29th Independent Infantry Brigade were intact. The ROK 6th Infantry Division could be employed as a division but its regiments were tattered; about half the ROK 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions had reassembled but were far less able than their strengths indicated; and both the 2nd Infantry Division and Turkish Brigade needed substantial refurbishing before they could again function as units. Of his reserves, the four ROK divisions operating against guerrillas in central and southern Korea were too untrained to be trustworthy on the line. His only other reserves were the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team and its attached Filipino and Thai battalions then guarding forward army supply installations; the Netherlands Battalion, which had just completed its processing at the UN Reception Center; and an infantry battalion from France, which had just disembarked at Pusan. By Walker's comparison of forces, the injured Eighth Army could not now set a successful, static defense. Considering delaying action to be the only course open, a course in which he should not risk becoming heavily engaged and in which he should anticipate moving out of Korea, Walker began to select delaying lines behind him. He intended to move south from one to the next well before his forces could be fixed, flanked, or enveloped. Though Eighth Army remained out of contact on 2 December, Walker received agent and aerial observer reports that the PVA were moving into the region east of Songch‚Äôon and that either they or North Korean guerrillas infesting that area had established blocking positions below the Pyongyang-Wonsan road from Songch‚Äôon eastward miles to Yangdok. They could be trying to secure a portion of the lateral route in advance of a drive toward either or both coasts, and should the drive go west into Pyongyang, they could trap the Eighth Army above the city. In view of the latter possibility, Walker elected to withdraw before the thrust materialized. Pyongyang was to be abandoned. Walker's use of relatively slight intelligence information in deciding to withdraw below Pyongyang reflected the general attitude of the Eighth Army. According to some accounts, Walker's forces had become afflicted with ‚Äúbugout fever,‚Äù a term usually used to describe a tendency to withdraw without fighting and even to disregard orders. Because it implied cowardice and dereliction of duty, the term was unwarranted. Yet the hard attacks and high casualties of the past week and the apparent Chinese strength had shaken the Eighth Army's confidence. This same doubt had some influence on Walker's decision to give up Pyongyang and would manifest itself again in other decisions to withdraw. But the principal reason for withdrawing had been, was, and would continue to be the constant threat of envelopment from the east. =X Corps front= In order to protect Hamhung and Hungnam while the 1st Marine Division and Army units withdrew from the Chosin Reservoir, in early December General Almond was concentrating his forces there. Meanwhile, at Wonsan a 3rd Infantry Division task force and United States Marine Corps shore party group was to protect that area, load the supplies and equipment stockpiled there and then abandon the area. By nightfall on 4 December, 3rd Infantry Division commander General Robert H. Soule concentrated the bulk of his division in the Hamhung-Hungnam area. With the 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment attached, he deployed on the 5th to defend a sector anchored below Yonpo Airfield southwest of Hungnam and arching northwest through Chigyong southwest of Hamhung to the village of Oro-ri () on the Chosin Reservoir road northwest of Hamhung. By dark on the 5th the greater part of the 7th Infantry Division also reached the Hamhung-Hungnam area. To assist the 7th's evacuation of Hyesanjin, the attached ROK 26th Regiment had taken covering positions astride the main Hyesanjin-Pukch‚Äôong withdrawal route about midway between the terminal towns. But the 7th Division came south without enemy contact. They demolished bridges and cratered the road behind them as far as the ROK position and in continuing their withdrawal prepared similar demolitions to be exploded by the ROK bringing up the rear. The 7th Division forces, after completing their withdrawal, put up defenses north and northeast of Hamhung adjacent to those of the 3rd Division. The leftmost position was not far east of Oro-ri, astride the road leading south from the Pujon Reservoir (); the rightmost blocked the coastal road. the 7th Division block at the right was temporary. General Almond's plan for ringing Hamhung and Hungnam now called for ROK I Corps to hold the northeast sector, including the coastal road. But the nearest ROK I Corps troops were still up the coast at Songjin, the rearmost another north in Kilchu. To assist the ROK withdrawal, General Almond arranged on the 5th through Admiral James H. Doyle to send five ships to Songjin to pick up the tail-end ROK 3rd Infantry Division. The ROK I Corps headquarters and the Capital Division meanwhile continued to withdraw overland.

Hickey, acting chief of staff of the Far East Command and UN Command, arrived with word from UN commander General Douglas MacArthur that, in effect, allowed Walker to leave behind any equipment and other materiel that he chose as long as they were destroyed. Walker, however, planned not to drop behind Pyongyang until the army and air force supply points in the city had been emptied and the port of Chinnamp‚Äôo cleared. To provide time for the removal he ordered a half step to the rear, sending his forces south toward a semicircular line still above Pyongyang. While service troops rushed to evacuate supplies and equipment from the North Korean capital and port, line units reached the temporary line late on 3 December with no PVA interference beyond being harassed by North Korean guerrillas on the east flank. Walker meanwhile pushed reserves eastward onto Route 33, the next Pyongyang-Seoul road inland from Route 1, to protect his east flank and to guarantee an additional withdrawal route below Pyongyang. He deployed the 24th Infantry Division at Yul-li (), southeast of Pyongyang, and the partially restored ROK II Corps at Sin‚Äôgye in the Yesong River valley another to the southeast. South and east of Sin‚Äôgye, units of the ROK 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions previously had occupied Sibyon-ni () and Yonch‚Äôon on Route 33, P‚Äôoch‚Äôon on Route 3, and Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon on Route 17 in the Pukhan River valley during anti-guerrilla operations. Route 33 thus was protected at important road junctions, and Walker at least had the semblance of an east flank screen all the way from Pyongyang to Seoul. Walker moved the damaged US 2nd Infantry Division from Chunghwa into army reserve at Munsan-ni on the Imjin River north of Seoul, where General Laurence B. Keiser, with priority on replacements, was to rebuild his unit. But while Keiser's immediate and main task was to revive the 2nd Division, Walker wanted him also to reconnoiter as far as Hwach‚Äôon, more than east of Munsan-ni, in case it became necessary to employ 2nd Division troops in those areas guarded by ROK units of doubtful ability. Walker attached the Turkish Brigade to the 2nd Division. Hurt less by casualties than by disorganization and equipment losses, the Turks had collected bit by bit at several locations, mostly at Pyongyang. On 2 December, after General Yazƒ±cƒ± had recovered some 3500 of his original 5000 men, Walker ordered the brigade to Kaesong, north of Munsan-ni, to complete refurbishing under General Keiser's supervision as more of its members were located and returned. Walker held the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team and its attachments in the Pyongyang area to protect his supply routes and installations. In preparation for the coming withdrawal south of the city, the airborne troops also were to keep civilians from moving over four pontoon bridges spanning the Taedong River, two inside Pyongyang and another pair east of the city, and to take whatever other precautions were necessary to insure an uninterrupted flow of military traffic over the crossings. On 3 December, after receiving more reports of sizable PVA movements and concentrations east and northeast of the Eighth Army position, Walker anticipated not only a westward PVA push into Pyongyang but also a deeper thrust southwest through the Yesong valley and across the Eighth Army withdrawal routes in the vicinity of Sin‚Äôgye. Induced to haste by this possibility, he ordered his line units to drop behind Pyongyang beginning on the morning of the 4th, to a line curving eastward from Kyomip‚Äôo on the lower bank of the Taedong to a point short of Koksan in a subsidiary valley of the upper Yesong River. Walker warned them to be ready to withdraw another on the west and on the east to a line running from Haeju on the coast north-eastward through Sin‚Äôgye, then eastward through Ich‚Äôon in the Imjin River valley. The latter withdrawal would set Walker's rightmost units along the Yesong valley in fair position to delay a PVA strike through it and would eliminate concern for the Eighth Army's left flank, which, after the initial withdrawal below Pyongyang, would open on the large Hwanghae peninsula southwest of Kyomip‚Äôo. In withdrawing south of Pyongyang, US IX Corps, now with the US 24th Infantry Division attached, was to move on Route 33, occupy the right sector of the new army front, and reinforce the weak ROK II Corps in protecting the army east flank in the Yesong valley. US I Corps was to withdraw to the west sector of the new line over Route 1 and, while passing through Pyongyang, destroy any abandoned materiel found within the city. I Corps‚Äô demolition assignment was likely to be sizable. Aside from organizational and individual equipment lost by the line units, the only notable materiel losses since the PVA opened their offensive had been 1400 tons of ammunition stored at Sinanju and 500 tons at Kunu-ri. But now Walker's forces were about to give up the locale of the Eighth Army's main forward stockpiles, and although the smaller stores at Chinnamp‚Äôo might be evacuated, it was less likely that the larger quantities brought into Pyongyang over the past several weeks could be completely removed on such short notice. The improbability of clearing the Pyongyang stocks was increased by the necessity to give priority on locomotives to trains carrying casualties and service units, by heavy demands on trucks for troop movements as well as for hauling materiel from supply point to railroad yard, and by the problems of loading and switching trains in congested yards that earlier had been severely damaged by UN air bombardment. With almost no PVA contact, Walker's forces moved south of Pyongyang within twenty-four hours. Much of the city was on fire by 07:30 on 5 December when the rearguards destroyed the last bridges over the Taedong and set off final demolitions in the section of Pyongyang below the river. Colonel Stebbins, Walker's G-4 who supervised the removal of materiel from Chinnamp‚Äôo and Pyongyang, would have preferred a slower move by 72 or even 48 hours. Given that additional time, Stebbins believed, the service troops could have removed most of the 8-10,000 tons of supplies and equipment that now lay abandoned and broken up or burning inside Pyongyang. More time also could have prevented such oversights as leaving at least 15 operable M46 Patton tanks abroad flatcars in the railroad yards in the southwestern part of the city. Fifth Air Force planes struck these overlooked tanks on 6 December, but differing pilot claims left obscure the amount of damage done. Although Chinnamp‚Äôo was exposed after early morning of the 5th, evacuation of the port continued until evening without harassment from PVA forces. Pressed only by time and the wide range of the Yellow Sea tides, the port troops from 2 through 5 December loaded LSTs, transports of the Japanese merchant marine, a squadron of U.S. Navy troop and cargo transports, and at least a hundred Korean sailboats. Aboard these craft went casualties, prisoners, and materiel sent from Pyongyang; the supplies and equipment on the ground around the port; the port service units themselves; and some thirty thousand refugees (most of them on the sailboats). Four American destroyers took station off Chinnamp‚Äôo, and aircraft from the British carrier appeared overhead on the 5th to protect the final outloading. That morning the port commander received word from Colonel Stebbins to get the last ships under way on the favorable tide at 17:00. The last three ships pulled away from the docks near that hour. Demolition crews set off their last explosives, and shortly afterward the last men ashore drove an amphibious truck out to a waiting ship. Some two thousand tons of supplies and a few items of port equipment had had to be destroyed for lack of time to remove them. The men and materiel sea-lifted from Chinnamp‚Äôo were landed either at Inchon (port personnel, rations, and petroleum products) or Pusan (patients, prisoners, and remaining supplies). Most of the stock evacuated from Pyongyang was shipped to depots at Kaesong and around Seoul. Some was kept forward aboard the railcars on which it had been loaded to institute a mobile system of meeting day-to-day requirements of the line units. These daily needs, mostly rations and petroleum products, were to be issued from the cars at railheads whose locations could be changed as rapidly as the line units withdrew. This system would reduce the likelihood of further materiel losses. The trace of the new army position vaguely resembled a question mark. I and IX Corps defenses between Kyomip‚Äôo and Yul-li formed the upper arc, IX Corps positions on the east flank from Yul-li southeastward to Sin‚Äôgye shaped the shank, and clumps of army reserves below Sin‚Äôgye supplied several dots. The figure traced was appropriate since Walker now had been out of meaningful contact with PVA forces for five days, had no clear idea of the location or movement of the main PVA body, and could only speculate on what the PVA commander could or intended to do next. In an attempt to fill the intelligence gap deriving from the withdrawals and the PVA slowness to follow, Walker on the 5th ordered I Corps commander General Frank W. Milburn and IX Corps commander General John B. Coulter to send strong reconnaissance patrols, including tanks, north as far as the Taedong River. But only the 1st Cavalry Division reported any noteworthy deep patrolling, on 6 December when two battalions sortied northeast up the Yesong valley and into Kokson, where they fought a minor skirmish with KPA troops, and on 7 December when two companies made another, but uneventful, visit to the town. Most of Walker's information continued to come from agents and aerial observers. The latter reported on the 6th that PVA troops were moving into Chinnamp‚Äôo and south across the Taedong estuary by ferry to the Hwanghae peninsula. Agents on the same day verified the presence of PVA troops in P‚Äôyongyang and reported that KPA regulars were joining North Korean guerrillas to the east and right rear of the Eighth Army. To escape the trouble these reports portended, Walker instructed his forward units to withdraw on 8 December to the Haeju-Sin‚Äôgye-Ich‚Äôon line and to extend that line east to Kumhwa. The west flank would again be anchored on the sea, and Walker's forces would be able to present a front instead of a flank to the KPA units reported gathering on the east. But what now worried Walker most were the whereabouts and intentions of the PVA he previously had suspected were maneuvering into attack position just beyond his east flank. Because his forces at no time since 30 November had captured or even sighted a PVA soldier during the sporadic encounters along the army right, he was beginning to believe that all enemy troops immediately east of him were KPA. PVA forces, then, possibly were moving south, not into position for a close-in envelopment but around the Eighth Army some distance to the east through the X Corps‚Äô rear area. Since General Almond's forces were concentrating at Hamhung and Hungnam far to the northeast, any such march by the PVA would be unopposed, and if the PVA moved through the open area in strength, they possibly could occupy all of South Korea with little or no difficulty. Walker anyway granted the PVA this capability and against the possibility of such a sweep took steps on 6 December to deploy troops across the entire peninsula. He planned no static defense. His concept of fighting a delaying action without becoming heavily engaged remained unchanged except that he now would delay from pre-selected lines stretching coast to coast. As a preliminary, Walker obtained General MacArthur's agreement to erase the southern segment of the Eighth Army-X Corps boundary so the peninsula below the 39th Parallel, more generally south of a line between Pyongyang and Wonsan. He also arranged air and naval surveillance of the east coast south of X Corps‚Äô position to detect enemy coastal movements while he was extending his line. He chose coast-to-coast positions running from the mouth of the Yesong River, almost behind Haeju, northeastward through Sibyon-ni, southeast through Ch‚Äôorwon and Hwach‚Äôon, then eastward to Yangyang on the Sea of Japan. This line, later designated Line A, was roughly long and at its most northerly point reached just above the 38th Parallel. Walker ordered five ROK Divisions, the two of ROK II Corps and three others then in central and southern Korea to occupy the eastern half of the line and to start moving into position immediately. I and IX Corps, scheduled eventually to man the western portion of Line A, remained for the time being under orders to withdraw only as far as the Haeju-Kumhwa line. =UN Command Order Number 5= The apprehensions evident in Walker's appraisals and plans were apparent in Tokyo as well. General MacArthur, although his main intention may have been to coax reinforcement, already had notified the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the UN Command was too weak to make a successful stand when he informed them on 28 November that he was passing to the defensive. The Joint Chiefs fully approved MacArthur's adoption of defensive tactics, but were not convinced that a successful static defense was impossible. They suggested that MacArthur place the Eighth Army in a continuous line across Korea between Pyongyang and Wonsan. MacArthur objected, claiming such a line was too long for the forces available and that the logistical problems posed by the high, road-poor mountains then separating Eighth Army and X Corps were too great. By concentrating the X Corps in the Hamhung area, MacArthur countered, he was creating a ‚Äúgeographic threat‚Äù to enemy lines of communication that made it tactically unsound for PVA forces to move south through the opening between those units. In any event, he predicted, the Chinese already arrayed against the Eighth Army would compel it to take a series of steps to the rear. The Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed that X Corps‚Äô concentration at Hamhung would produce the effect MacArthur anticipated. In their judgment, the Chinese already had demonstrated a proficiency for moving strong forces through difficult mountains, and the concentration of the X Corps on the east coast combined with the predicted further withdrawals of the Eighth Army would only widen the opening through which the Chinese could move. They again urged MacArthur to consolidate Eighth Army and X Corps sufficiently to prevent large enemy forces from passing between the two commands or outflanking either of them. But MacArthur defended his view of a Pyongyang-Wonsan line, pointing out that he and Walker already had agreed that Pyongyang could not be held and that the Eighth Army probably would be forced south at least as far as Seoul. Turning his reasoning in support of a request for ground reinforcements ‚Äúof the greatest magnitude,‚Äù he emphasized on 3 December that his present strength would allow him at most to prolong his resistance to the PVA by making successive withdrawals or by taking up ‚Äúbeachhead bastion positions‚Äù and that a failure to receive reinforcements portended the eventual destruction of his command. The response to MacArthur's estimate was as gloomy as his predictions. Prompted by earlier dismal reports to visit the Far East for a firsthand appraisal, Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins informed MacArthur on 4 December that no reinforcement in strength, at least in the near future, was possible. The remaining Joint Chiefs meanwhile replied from Washington that preservation of the UN Command was now the guiding consideration and that they concurred in the consolidation of MacArthur's forces into beachheads. Beachhead sites that in varying degrees could facilitate a withdrawal from Korea were Hungnam and Wonsan for X Corps and Inchon and Pusan for the Eighth Army. General Collins, while touring Korea between 4 and 6 December, heard General Walker and General Almond on the best beachheads and on how best to handle their respective commands. Almond believed that he could hold Hungnam indefinitely and wanted to stay there out of certainty that by doing so he could divert substantial Chinese strength from the Eighth Army front. Walker, on the other hand, believed the preservation of the Eighth Army required a deep withdrawal. Walker attempted to forestall any order to defend Seoul, insisting that tying his forces to the city would only allow the PVA to encircle Eighth Army and force a slow, costly evacuation through Inchon. He favored pulling back to Pusan, where once before he had broken the KPA offensive and where now, if reinforced by X Corps, Eighth Army might hold out indefinitely. MacArthur's G-3, General Wright, meanwhile recommended Pusan as the best beachhead for both the Eighth Army and X Corps on that grounds that should UN forces be compelled to leave Korea, they should leave the distinct impression of having delayed the enemy as long and as well as possible. Wright also pointed out that defending successive Lines into the southeastern tip of the peninsula would afford UN air forces the greatest opportunity to hurt the PVA; further, if a withdrawal from Korea became necessary during the remaining winter months, MacArthur's command could escape extreme weather conditions at Pusan; finally, an evacuation at any time could be effected faster through the Pusan facilities than through any other port. To permit the longest delaying action possible and to enable an evacuation from the best port, Wright recommended that X Corps be sea lifted from Hungnam as soon as possible and landed in southeastern Korea, that X Corps then join the Eighth Army and pass to Walker's command, and thereafter that the UN Command withdraw through successive positions, if necessary to the Pusan area. On 7 December in Tokyo, Generals MacArthur, Collins and George Stratemeyer, Admirals C. Turner Joy and Arthur Dewey Struble and Lt. Gen. Lemuel C. Shepherd, the commander of all United States Marine Corps forces in the Pacific, considered the various views generated during the week past and agreed on plans that embodied most of the recommendations of General Wright. MacArthur set these plans in effect on the 8th in CINCUNC (Commander in Chief, United Nations Command) Order Number 5. He listed nine lines to be defended by the Eighth Army, the southernmost based on the Naktong River in the general area of the old Pusan Perimeter. But he insisted that Walker not surrender Seoul until and unless an enemy maneuver unquestionably was about to block the Eighth Army's further withdrawal to the south. Related to this stipulation, four lines lay above Seoul, the last of which, resting on the Imjin River in the west and extending eastward to the coast, was MacArthur's first delineation of positions across the entire peninsula. Here the peninsula was somewhat narrower than in the Pyongyang-Wonsan region and offered a road net that could accommodate supply movements. Earlier pessimistic reports to Washington notwithstanding, MacArthur apparently believed that the Eighth Army and X Corps combined could man this line; indeed, he expected Walker to make an ardent effort to hold it. Through correspondence and interviews, MacArthur meanwhile had responded publicly to charges appearing in a substantial segment of the press that he was responsible for the reverse his forces were suffering at the hands of the Chinese. In defense of his strategy and tactics, he insisted that his command could not have fought more efficiently given the restrictions placed upon it by the policy of limiting hostilities to Korea. This criticism of administration policy rankled President Harry Truman, particularly because MacArthur voiced it publicly and frequently enough to lead \\"many people abroad to believe that our government would change its policy.\\" Truman issued instructions on 5 December by which he intended to insure that information made public by an executive branch official was \\"accurate and fully in accord with the policies of the United States Government.\\" Specifically applicable to General MacArthur, \\"Officials overseas, including military commanders, were to clear all but routine statements with their departments, and to refrain from direct communication on military or foreign policy with newspapers, magazines or other publicity media in the United States.\\" The Joint Chiefs of Staff forwarded the president's instructions to MacArthur on 6 December. =Eighth Army withdrawal to Line B= On 7 December General MacArthur had radioed a warning to both Walker and Almond of the next day's order for successive withdrawals, the defense of Seoul short of becoming entrapped, and the assignment of X Corps to the Eighth Army. So guided, Walker on the 8th laid out Line B, which duplicated Line A eastward from Hwach‚Äôon but in the opposite direction fell off to the southwest to trace the lower bank of the Imjin and Han Rivers, some behind the Yesong River. This line was at least shorter than Line A and matched the northernmost coast-to-coast line designated by MacArthur, and now became the line toward which Walker began to move his forces for the defense of Seoul. On 11 December MacArthur made his first visit to Korea since he had watched the start of the Home by Christmas Offensive on 24 November. He was now on the peninsula for a firsthand view of the Eighth Army and X Corps after their setbacks at the hands of the PVA and for personal conferences with Walker and Almond on the steps the two line commanders had taken or planned to take in carrying out the maneuvers and command change he had ordered three days before. When MacArthur reached Walker's headquarters (having first stopped in northeastern Korea to confer with General Almond), he was able to see not only the Eighth Army plan for withdrawing to Line B but also Walker's plans in case the Eighth Army again was squeezed into the southeastern corner of the peninsula. Reviving an unused plan developed by the Eighth Army staff in September, Walker reestablished not only the Naktong River defenses but also three lines between the old perimeter and Pusan, each arching between the south coast and east coast around the port. Nearer Pusan, the Davidson Line curved northeastward from a south coast anchor at Masan; next southeast, the Raider Line stretched from the south coast resort town of Chinhae; and just outside the port, the Pusan Line arched from the mouth of the Naktong. Walker instructed 2nd Logistical Command commander General Garvin to fortify these lines using Korean labor and all other means and manpower available within his command. On the day following MacArthur's visit Walker established two more lettered lines. Line C followed the lower bank of the Han River just below Seoul, curved northeast to Hongch‚Äôon, below Hwach‚Äôon, then reached almost due east to the coast at Wonpo-ri, behind Yangyang. Line D, next south, ran from a west coast anchor below Seoul northeast through the towns of Pyongtaek, Ansong, Changhowon-ni and Wonju to Wonpo-ri. These lines were to be occupied if and when enemy pressure forced the Eighth Army to give up Seoul, but before any deep withdrawal as far as the Naktong was required. Amid this contingency planning and through 22 December Walker gradually pulled his forward units south and pushed ROK forces north into positions generally along Line B. US I and IX Corps, withdrawing over Routes 1 and 33, bounded in three-day intervals through the Haeju-Kumhwa line and Line A toward sectors along the western third of Line B. The withdrawal was uncontested except for minor encounters with KPA troops on IX Corps‚Äô east flank, but thousands of refugees moving with and trailing the two Corps had to be turned off the main roads lest they block the withdrawal routes. By 23 December both Corps occupied stable positions in their new sectors. I Corps, with two divisions and a brigade, stood along Route 1 along the lower banks of the Han and the Imjin; IX Corps, with two divisions, blocked Routes 33 and 3 right at the 38th Paralle1. Spreading ROK forces along the remainder of the line proved more frustrating. Transportation requirements exceeded available trucks: resistance from KPA troops in the central region slowed the ROK; and general confusion among the sketchily trained ROK units caused further delay. But by 23 December General Walker managed to get ROK III Corps up from southern Korea and, with three divisions, emplaced in a central sector adjoining IX Corps on the east. The ROK front lay below Line B, almost exactly on the 38th Parallel, with its center located about north of Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon. In more rugged ground next east, ROK II Corps occupied a narrow one division front astride Route 24, which passed southwestward through the Hongch‚Äôon River valley. II Corps thus blocked what otherwise could provide PVA/KPA forces easy access south through central Korea over Route 29 and to lateral routes leading west to the Seoul area. By 20 December ROK I Corps had been sea lifted in increments out of northeastern Korea, landed at Pusan and near Samch‚Äôok close to the east coast anchor of Line B, and transferred to Eighth Army control. Walker immediately committed ROK I Corps to defend the eastern end of the army line. By the 23rd ROK I Corps, with two divisions, occupied scattered positions blocking several mountain tracks and the east coast road. Regardless of his success in stretching forces across the peninsula, Walker lacked confidence in the line he had built. His defenses were shallow and there were gaps. He mainly mistrusted the ROK forces along the eastern two-thirds of the line. He doubted that they would hold longer than momentarily against a strong PVA/KPA attack, and, should they give way, his forces above Seoul in the west would be forced to follow suit. It was to meet this particular contingency that he had established Lines C and D on 12 December. On the 15th he extended his effort by dispatching the 1st Cavalry Division out along the connected Routes 2-18-17 northeast of Seoul as added protection against any strike at the capital city from the direction of Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon. The same day, he began moving his army headquarters less a small group to remain in Seoul, south to Taegu. He already had directed the removal of major supply stores located in or above Seoul to safer positions below the Han River and had ordered the reduction of stocks held in the Inchon port complex. On the 18th he assigned Corps' boundaries along Line C and described the deployment of army reserve units to cover a withdrawal to this first line below Seoul. Two days later he ordered the still-weak US 2nd Infantry Division, which by then had stepped back from Munsan-ni to Yongdungp‚Äôo, a suburb of Seoul just below the Han, to move to the town of Ch‚Äôungju, some southeast of Seoul. From there the division was to be ready to move against any PVA/KPA force breaking through ROK lines in central or eastern Korea and was to protect the flank of Walker's western forces in any withdrawal prompted by such a thrust. General Keiser in the meantime had been evacuated because of illness, and Maj. Gen. Robert B. McClure now commanded the 2nd Infantry Division. To General MacArthur, the elaborate preparations for a withdrawal below Seoul indicated that Walker had decided against a determined defense of the city. When MacArthur raised the question, Walker assured him that he would hold Seoul as long as he could. But, Walker pointed out, sudden collapses of ROK forces twice before had placed the Eighth Army in jeopardy. Nor had the ROK shown any increased stability even after strenuous efforts to improve it. If, as he suspected, the ROK units now along the eastern two-thirds of Line B failed to stand against an attack, his positions north of Seoul could not be held and the then necessary withdrawal would have to be made over an obstacle, the Han River. In Walker's mind these two dangers, of another sudden ROK collapse and of making a river crossing in a withdrawal, made his extensive preparations a matter of \\"reasonable prudence.\\" Walker also was convinced that the PVA/KPA were now capable of opening an offensive at any time. He still had no solid contact with PVA/KPA forces, but by pressing intelligence sources over the previous two weeks he had obtained sufficient evidence to predict an imminent attack and to forecast the strength, paths, objective, and even possible date of the next blow. Between 8 and 14 December Walker caught a southeastward shift of the KPA II Corps, the bulk of which previously had been concentrated in and operating as a guerrilla force out of the mountains between Koksan and Inchon. Apparently having retaken regular status, the Corps paralleled the Eighth Army's southeastern withdrawals below Pyongyang. As Walker's forces spread out along Line B, the KPA Corps followed suit, occupying positions just above the 38th Parallel in the central sector, principally between Yonch‚Äôon in the Wonsan- Seoul corridor and Hwach‚Äôon, due north of Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon. It also seemed that earlier reports of reconstituted KPA units joining the II Corps were correct. Several renewed KPA divisions apparently had assembled immediately behind the II Corps to make a total strength of 65,000 plausible for the KPA troops directly opposite the Eighth Army's central sector as of 23 December. As late as 17 December Walker was still completely out of contact with PVA forces and by the 23rd had encountered only a few, these in the I and IX Corps sectors in the west. General Partridge, who had shifted the emphasis of Fifth Air Force operations to armed reconnaissance and interdiction about the time Walker had given up Pyongyang, was able to verify that PVA forces had moved south in strength from the Ch'ongch'on battlefields, but not how far. Until mid- December his fighter pilots and light bomber crews discovered and attacked large troop columns moving openly in daylight over main and secondary roads between the Ch‚Äôongch‚Äôon and Pyongyang. But then, to escape Partridge's punishing attacks, the PVA reverted to their strict practices of concealment and camouflage and halted virtually all daytime movement. Walker, consequently, had no clear evidence that the main body of the PVA XIII Army Group had moved any farther south than Pyongyang. But on the basis of repeated reports from agents and air observers that PVA troops and supplies were moving southeastward from Pyongyang, by the 23rd he considered it possible that three or four Chinese armies with about 150,000 troops were bunched within a day's march of the Eighth Army's central front. This possibility brought the estimate of enemy strength above Walker's central positions to 180,000. Furthermore, Walker judged, these troops could be reinforced by any units of the PVA XIII Army Group remaining in the Pyongyang area within four to eight days and by the PVA/KPA units currently operating in the X Corps sector within six to ten days. To Walker, the apparent concentration and disposition of PVA/KPA forces opposite his central front clearly suggested offensive preparations in which KPA II Corps was screening the assembly of assault forces and supplies. Small KPA attacks below Yonch‚Äôon and from Hwach‚Äôon toward Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon seemed designed to search out weaknesses in the Eighth Army line in those areas and indicated the possibility of a converging attack on Seoul south along Route 33 and southwest over the road from Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon. A likely date for opening such an attack, because of a possible psychological advantage to the attackers, was Christmas Day. Walker's largest hope of holding Seoul for any length of time in these circumstances rested on the arrival of the remainder of X Corps from northeastern Korea. Once he had General Almond's forces in hand, Walker planned to insert them in the Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon sector now held by the untried ROK III Corps. This move would place American units along the Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon-Seoul axis, one of the more likely PVA/KPA approaches in an attack to seize Seoul. Whether X Corps would be available soon enough depended first on how closely Walker had estimated the opening date of the threatening PVA/KPA offensive and second on how long it would take General Almond to get his forces out of northeastern Korea and to refurbish them for employment under the Eighth Army. =Withdrawal of X Corps from northeast Korea= Following the earlier decision to concentrate X Corps forces at Hungnam, the evacuation of Wonsan had begun on 3 December. In a week's time, without interference from PVA/KPA forces, the US 3rd Infantry Division task force and a Marine Corps shore party group totaling some 3,800 troops loaded themselves, 1,100 vehicles, 10,000 tons of other cargo, and 7,000 refugees aboard transport ships and LSTs provided by Admiral Doyle's Task Force 90. One LST sailed north on the 9th to Hungnam, where its Marine shore party passengers were to take part in the forthcoming sealift. The remaining ships steamed for Pusan on the 9th and 10th. On 8 December 1950 General Almond received General MacArthur's order to evacuate X Corps through Hungnam. The Task Force 90 ships dispatched to Songjin on 5 December to pick up the tail-end troops of ROK I Corps meanwhile had reached their destination and by noon on 9 December had taken aboard the ROK 3rd Infantry Division (less the 26th Regiment, which withdrew to Hungnam as rearguard for the ROK 7th Infantry Division; the division headquarters, division artillery and 18th Regiment of the ROK Capital Division; and some 4300 refugees. On 10 and 11 December the convoy from Songjin anchored at Hungnam only long enough to unload the Capital Division's headquarters and artillery for employment in the perimeter and to take aboard an advance party of the ROK I Corps headquarters before proceeding to its new destination. On 9 December, Almond alerted his forces for a \\"withdrawal by water and air without delay from Hungnam area to Pusan-Pohang-dong area.\\" The larger exodus was to be by sea, with the Hungnam defenses contracting as Corps' forces were loaded, but airlift was to be employed for as long as Yonpo Airfield remained within the shrinking perimeter. The evacuation began on 12 December with the 1st Marine Division boarding ships and sailing for Pusan on 15 December, they assembled at Masan on 18 December and passed to Eighth Army control. The 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment was evacuated by air from Yonpo Airfield on 15 December. The US 7th Infantry Division began loading on 14 December and most of the Division was on board by 16 December. On 17 December ROK I Corps was embarked and it landed at Samch‚Äôok on 20 December passing to Eighth Army command. Also on 17 December an X Corps advance headquarters opened at Kyongju and Yonpo Airfield was abandoned as the perimeter shrank. From 18 to 20 December the US 3rd Division relieved the remaining 7th Division units on the perimeter and General Almond moved his command post aboard USS Mount McKinley. By 23 December the US 3rd Division withdrew to their last phase lines and the next day the evacuation was completed and the port facilities of Hungnam destroyed. In addition to the UN forces, over 98,100 Korean civilians had been evacuated from Hungnam, Wonsan and Songjin. Aftermath In announcing the completion of X Corps‚Äô withdrawal from Hungnam in a communique on 26 December, General MacArthur took occasion to appraise UN operations from the time his command had resumed its advance on 24 November and, once again, to remark on the restrictions that had been placed on him. He blamed the incorrect assessment of Chinese strength, movements, and intentions before the resumption on the failure of \\"political intelligence... to penetrate the iron curtain\\" and on the limitations placed on field intelligence activities, in particular his not being allowed to conduct aerial reconnaissance beyond the borders of Korea. So handicapped, his advance, which he later termed a \\"reconnaissance-in-force,\\" was the \\"proper, indeed the sole, expedient,\\" and ‚Äúwas the final test of Chinese intentions.‚Äù In both the advance and the redeployment south, he concluded, ‚Äúno command ever fought more gallantly or efficiently under unparalleled conditions of restraint and handicap, and no command could have acquitted itself to better advantage under prescribed missions and delimitations involving unprecedented risk and jeopardy. But while MacArthur earlier had proclaimed that only by advancing could he determine PVA/KPA strength, he had not designed or designated the UN attack as a reconnaissance in force, nor was it. It was, rather, a general offensive whose objective was the northern border of Korea. =Ridgway takes command= On the morning of 23 December General Walker left Seoul by jeep to visit units above Uijongbu. north, his jeep started past two 2 1/2-ton trucks halted on the opposite side of the road headed south. Almost at the same moment, a Korean civilian driving a 3/4-ton truck pulled out from behind the halted vehicles to proceed south and partially entered the northbound lane to get past the parked trucks. Walker's driver swerved away from the oncoming truck but was unable to avoid a collision. The impact threw Walker's vehicle sideways and overturned it, and all occupants were thrown out and injured. General Walker was unconscious and had no discernible pulse when he was picked up by escorts in a following vehicle. At the 24th Division clearing station nearby, he was pronounced dead of multiple head injuries. In routine anticipation of casualties before Walker's death, General MacArthur had obtained the agreement of the Army chief of staff that Walker's successor, if one was needed, should be Lt. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, then serving on the Department of the Army staff as deputy chief of staff for operations and administration. On receiving word of General Walker's death, MacArthur telephoned General Collins in Washington to report the news and to ask for Ridgway. Near midnight on 22 December Collins notified Ridgway that he was the new commander of the Eighth Army, and hurried preparations on the 23d put Ridgway in the air en route to Tokyo that night. Ridgway reached Tokyo's Haneda Airport shortly before midnight on 25 December. On the morning of 26 December Ridgway met with MacArthur whose instructions resembled those given to General Walker: hold as far north as possible and hold Seoul as long as possible. The most to be expected of the Eighth Army, MacArthur told Ridgway, was an eventual tactical success that would clear and secure South Korea. A battlefield success of any substance in the meantime would help Washington answer what MacArthur called the \\"mission vacuum,\\" meaning the question raised by the Chinese intervention of whether UNC forces could or should stay in Korea. When Ridgway asked near the close of the meeting whether MacArthur would object to a decision to attack, MacArthur replied, \\"The Eighth Army is yours, Matt. Do what you think best.\\" Whereas previously MacArthur had played a key and direct role in planning and conducting tactical operations. He would do so no longer. General Ridgway would make all the decisions regarding the employment of the Eighth Army with no requirement to refer them to MacArthur for approval. Ridgway would always inform MacArthur in detail of those decisions, but MacArthur would never question him. Before leaving for Korea at noon, Ridgway radioed his formal assumption of command of the Eighth Army with instructions that his message, translated as necessary, be read by all officers and by as many enlisted men as possible. \\"You will have my utmost,\\" he advised his new command. \\"I shall expect yours.\\" On reaching the main Eighth Army headquarters at Taegu late on 26 December, Ridgway was displeased at finding the bulk of his staff so far to the rear. His immediate step was to get to the army forward command post. At dawn on 27 December he flew to Seoul, where the handful of staff officers he found deepened his resolve to remedy the headquarters arrangement. He planned not only to redistribute his staff but also to move the forward command post to a more central location from where he could reach all Corps and divisions in minimum time. Following a staff conference and meetings with American Ambassador John J. Muccio and South Korean President Syngman Rhee in Seoul, Ridgway began a four-day reconnaissance of the Line B front that took him to all Corps and divisions except the ROK Capital Division on the east coast, whose sector was quiet and unthreatened by impending PVA/KPA action. By evening of the 30th he was back at Eighth Army headquarters in Taegu, much disturbed by what he had learned. The Eighth Army was clearly a dispirited command. \\"I could sense it the moment I came into a command post... I could read it in the faces of... leaders, from sergeants right on up to the top. They were unresponsive, reluctant to talk. I had to drag information out of them. There was a complete absence of that alertness, that aggressiveness, that you find in troops whose spirit is high.\\" The attack that Ridgway had hoped would be possible he now considered plainly out of the question. He also considered it imperative to strengthen the Eighth Army front if his forces were to hold Line B. Whether he had time enough to do so was questionable. Additional evidence of an imminent PVA/KPA offensive had appeared as Ridgway reconnoitered the front, and the coming New Year holiday was now a logical date on which to expect the opening assault. =UN forces on the eve of the Chinese third phase campaign= UN lines 26‚Äì30 December 1950 Unit dispositions along the line had changed little since General Walker succeeded in manning it. The 8213th Army Unit patrolled Kanghwa Island at the extreme west in the I Corps sector. Next east, the Turkish Brigade overlooked the Han River estuary from the upper end of the Kimpo peninsula. Above the Han, the 25th Infantry Division, to which the Turks and Rangers were attached, straddled Route 1 along the lower bank of the Imjin River, and the ROK 1st Division defended the Corps' right from positions along the Imjin reaching northeast almost to Route 33 in the Wonsan-Seoul corridor. The British 29th Brigade was assembled in I Corps reserve along Route 1 just outside Seoul. IX Corps lay across the Wonsan-Seoul corridor along the 38th parallel, the ROK 6th Division astride Route 33 at the left, the 24th Division across Route 3 at the right. In Corps' reserve, the British 27th Brigade was assembled near the junction of Routes 33 and 3 at Uijongbu. The 1st Cavalry Division, also in reserve, retained the mission assigned to it while under army control of blocking the Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon-Seoul road. Now attached to the cavalry division were the Filipino battalion and the Greek Expeditionary Force, an infantry battalion that had reached Korea on 8 December. Near the 38th Parallel above Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon, ROK III Corps defended a wide sector with the ROK 2nd, 5th and 8th Divisions on line and the ROK 7th Division in reserve. In the narrow ROK II Corps sector next east, a single division, the ROK 3rd, continued to block Route 24 running southwestward through the Hongch‚Äôon River valley. ROK I Corps defended a gaping line at the Eighth Army right, with the ROK 9th Division in the high mountains at the Corps' left and the ROK Capital Division across the slopes and coastal road at the eastern anchor of the front. Ridgway's main reserve for strengthening the front was X Corps. Other resources present or scheduled to arrive in Korea by the end of the year were exceedingly few. The US 2nd Infantry Division, still not fully recovered from its late November losses but now reinforced by the Netherlands and French battalions, was centrally located at Ch‚Äôungju. In the west, the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, with the Thai battalion attached, was assembled at Suwon south of Seoul. Outside these forces, the only available unit was the ROK 11th Division currently operating against guerrillas in various locations to the south. The 2nd Battalion of Canada's Princess Patricia's Light Infantry had reached Korea in mid-December but was at Miryang in the southeast for eight weeks of training before entering battle. Similarly, the 16th New Zealand Field Regiment, actually an artillery battalion, due to reach Korea on the 31st, would require training before it moved to the front. The only units en route to Korea that might be able to move forward upon arrival were two US airborne Ranger companies, the 2nd and 4th. Holding against the threatening enemy offensive, Ridgway judged, rested on committing most of his reserves early and on revitalizing the spirit of the Eighth Army. By the time he returned to Taegu on the 30th he had taken several steps toward achieving both. Restoring the Eighth Army's morale and confidence, Ridgway believed, depended mainly on improving leadership throughout his command, but before he would relieve any commander, he wanted personally to see more of the man in action, to know that the relief would not damage the unit involved, and to be sure that he had a better commander available. For the time being, he intended to correct deficiencies by working ‚Äúon and through‚Äù his current Corps and division commanders. One deficiency he had noted was that many commanders conducted operations from command posts far behind the front. To correct this practice, he ordered \\"division commanders to be up with their forward battalions, and... corps commanders up with the regiment that was in the hottest action.\\" He saw further weaknesses in leadership and staff work in the intelligence briefings he received. Confronted during one of the first briefings with a map whose main feature was \\"a big red goose egg... with ‚Äò174,000‚Äô scrawled in the middle of it,\\" Ridgway said ‚ÄúHere the enemy was leaning right up against us, but we did not know his strength, and we did not have his location pinpointed.\\" He attributed such imprecision directly to the Eighth Army's tendency to \\"look over its shoulder.\\" As a result of this tendency, the line troops had not maintained proper contact with enemy forces or learned enough about the terrain to their front. He promptly rebuked his subordinates for failing to meet these two basic combat requirements. They were to patrol until they had defined the enemy's positions and determined the strengths of units opposite them, and he warned that he \\"didn‚Äôt want to ask any man where a trail went and have him tell me he didn‚Äôt know.\\" Ridgway did receive another intelligence report from Eight Army intelligence officer Colonel Tarkenton of the estimated strength of the Chinese XIII Army Group. The group's six armies, each with a strength of 29,000, were either along the Eighth Army front or in the immediate PVA/KPA rear area. Tarkenton believed KPA corps totaling 65,800 men also were at the front and that a fourth was approaching it. The greatest enemy strength seemed to be massed opposite the Eighth Army's west-central sector, an indication that the main attack would come through the Wonsan-Seoul corridor over Routes 33 and 3. A strong secondary attack farther east also seemed probable, either southwest over the Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon-Seoul axis or south through Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon and Wonju via Route 29, in an attempt to outflank I and IX Corps above Seoul. Two recent attacks by units of the KPA II and V Corps opened as Ridgway reached Korea, supported Tarkenton's prediction of a strong secondary effort in the east. northeast of Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon, two KPA regiments coming from the Hwach‚Äôon Reservoir area hit the ROK 8th Division at the right of ROK III Corps and gouged deep salient before the ROK contained the attack. Out of the Inje area, northeast of Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon, a larger force believed to include a division and a reinforced regiment struck southwestward through the ROK 9th Division's flimsy position at the left of ROK I Corps. Entering the rear area of the narrow ROK II Corps' sector, the attack force by 30 December established a strong roadblock on the central arterial, Route 29, almost below Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon. By extending these gains, especially the deeper southwestward thrust out of the Inje area, KPA forces conceivably could sever the Eighth Army's main lines of communication. Ridgway's first tactical move was to counter this threat from the northeast. On 27 December Ridgway ordered part of the 2nd Infantry Division north from Ch‚Äôungju into the projected path of the KPA. General McClure was to move a regimental combat team north to Wonju, from where it could oppose any KPA attempt to advance south over Route 29 or west along Route 20 and where it could protect a vulnerable link of the central Pusan-Seoul rail line, which served as an Eighth Army supply route. McClure was in the process of moving the 23rd Infantry Regiment and the French battalion to Wonju on the 29th when the KPA attack out of Inje carried behind ROK II Corps farther north. Ridgway consequently ordered McClure to move the remainder of his division to Wonju and to send one regiment north of that town to Hongch‚Äôon where Route 29 from Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon and Route 24 from the northeast intersected. McClure complied on the 30th, sending the 23rd Infantry toward Hongch‚Äôon to join the ROK 23rd Regiment, 7th Division. Before the 23rd Infantry Regiment could complete its move above Wonju, the KPA force reported by ROK III Corps to number between 700 and 1200 men, blocked Route 29 below Hongch‚Äôon. The 23rd's advance became a clearing operation, made in concert with a battalion of the ROK 23d Regiment, which moved south out of Hongch‚Äôon and with the reserve ROK 5th Regiment, 3rd Division, which dropped south from Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon to a point west of the KPA position and then struck eastward against it. The concerted effort cleaned out most of the roadblock on the 31st. The battalion of the ROK 23rd Regiment returned to Hongch‚Äôon while the ROK 5th Regiment and the leading battalion of the 23rd Infantry stayed to clear the remainder of the KPA position. The balance of the 23rd Infantry was strung out on Route 29, a battalion at Hoengseong below the roadblock site, the remainder still in Wonju where the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division was now assembling. While installing the 2nd Division in the Hongch‚Äôon-Wonju area might hold off the KPA currently advancing from the northeast, the defensive weakness in the three ROK Corps sectors left open the likelihood of stronger, more effective PVA/KPA penetrations. Against this possibility, Ridgway planned to reinforce this portion of the front, much as General Walker had decided earlier, by setting X Corps in the Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon sector now held by ROK III Corps and by placing the bulk of his ROK forces along a narrower, more solid front in the highermountains and coastal slopes to the east. Since time was critical, Ridgway on 28 December pressed General Almond and the commander of the 2nd Logistical Command, General Garvin, to quicken the readiness preparations of the 1st Marine, 3rd and 7th Divisions. The Marines, now reattached to X Corps, and the 7th Division were fully assembled but were still refurbishing and the 3rd Division, last to leave Hungnam, was not yet three-quarters ashore. The ships carrying the remaining 3rd Division troops were in Pusan harbor, however, and following Ridgway's 29 December order that these ships be unloaded without delay, the balance of the 3rd Division was ashore and en route to the division's assembly area south of Kyongju by nightfall on 30 December. Since it was nevertheless obvious that X Corps as currently constituted could not move forward for some time, Ridgway on the 29th approved plans developed by his staff for adjusting Almond's order of battle to permit earlier commitment. Under these plans X Corps headquarters and whichever of Almond's present divisions completed its preparations first would move to Wonju, where Almond would add the US 2nd Infantry Division and possibly one ROK division to his command as substitutes for the two divisions left behind. Even this arrangement would take time; the estimate for moving one of Almond's current divisions from its southern assembly area to the battle zone was 8 to 10 days. Once forward, X Corps was to operate with the initial mission of destroying any PVA/KPA penetration of the ROK front above it and of protecting IX Corps‚Äô east flank. Ridgway gave Almond detailed instructions on the 30th. Having learned that the 7th Division would be ready ahead of the other two divisions, he directed Almond to move one of its regiments the next day to Chech‚Äôon, below Wonju, where Route 60 and a mountain road coming from the east and northeast joined Route 29. When Almond could get the remainder of the division forward, he was to assemble the 7th near the 2nd so that both divisions could be deployed quickly against any PVA/KPA penetration from the direction of Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon and Inje or from the east toward Hoengsong and Wonju. Almond subsequently could expect to occupy a sector of the front. In the meantime, he was to develop Route 29 southeastward from Wonju through Chech‚Äôon, Tanyang, Yongju and Andong as the main X Corps supply route. On 31 December Ridgway placed the 1st Marine and 3rd Divisions in army reserve. When fully refurbished, the Marines were to move from Masan to an east coast assembly in the Yongch‚Äôon-Kyongju-P‚Äôohangdong area and prepare to occupy blocking positions wherever needed to the north. The 3rd Division was to reassemble in the west. As soon as General Soule finished reorganizing and reequipping his forces he was to move them into the Pyongtaek-Ansong area south of Seoul and prepare them for operations in either the I or IX Corps sector. =The Seoul defenses= While reinforcing the ROK sector of the front, Ridgway also deepened the defense of Seoul. After conferences with General Milburn and General Coulter on the 27th, he instructed them to organize a bridgehead above Seoul along a line curving from the north bank of the Han west of Seoul through a point just below Uijongbu at the junction of Routes 33 and 3 to the north and back to the Han east of the city. The Bridgehead Line would be deep enough to keep the Han bridges below Seoul free of PVA/KPA artillery fire. The position therefore would be suitable for covering a general withdrawal below Seoul that might accompany or follow the occupation of the Bridgehead Line. Milburn and Coulter each were to place a division on the Bridgehead Line if the expected PVA/KPA attack forced them to vacate their Line B positions. Ridgway at first restricted any I and IX Corps withdrawal from the present front to his own personal order. But on reconsidering the high estimate of PVA strength opposite the two Corps, the tendency of some ROK units to break under pressure, and the demonstrated PVA preference for night attacks, he realized that this restriction could create a costly delay should Milburn and Coulter be unable to contact him promptly. He therefore authorized the two Corps commanders to withdraw on their own at any time they agreed that it was necessary but could not reach him. No matter who gave the order, Ridgway insisted that a withdrawal to the Bridgehead Line be more than a mere move from one line to another; both Corps were to attack PVA/KPA forces who followed. The terrain could accommodate this tactic, especially in the Wonsan-Seoul corridor where the PVA/KPA would be obliged to use routes surrounded by higher ground. Ridgway expected Milburn and Coulter to leave strong forces of infantry and armor posted in this high ground as the two Corps withdrew; these forces would strike advancing PVA/KPA units and disrupt the follow-up before they themselves moved back to the bridgehead. Ridgway attached the 2nd Ranger Company to the 1st Cavalry Division in the west and the 4th Ranger Company to the 7th Division in the east. Since the 2nd Infantry Division was operating in the Wonju area where the surrounding mountains prohibited armor, he ordered McClure's 72nd Tank Battalion to the west for attachment to IX Corps, which might use it to punish any PVA/KPA advance on Seoul. Anticipating an opening PVA/KPA attack towards the capital on New Year's Day, Ridgway returned there on the afternoon of 31 December. According to Colonel Tarkenton's latest intelligence estimate, PVA/KPA forces were fully deployed. In the west, KPA I Corps straddled Route 1 at the Imjin with the PVA 50th Army concentrated just behind it; the 39th Army had spread out near the Imjin between Routes 1 and 33; the 38th Army sat astride Route 33 below Yonch'on with the 40th Army assembled to its rear; and the 66th Army lay across Routes 3 and 17, its forces pointed at both Uijongbu and Ch‚Äôunch‚Äôon, with the 42nd Army backing it up at Kumhwa. Further east, the full KPA V Corps, previously in the area now occupied by the 66th Army, had joined KPA II Corps in the region between and below Hwach‚Äôon and Inje. This concentration, the expected arrival of KPA III Corps in the same area, and the probability that forces from PVA IX Army Group would move down into the same region from Hungnam represented, in Tarkenton's estimation, a sufficient force to exploit successfully the KPA gains already registered in the east. The preponderance of PVA/KPA forces above Seoul still pointed to a main effort against the South Korean capital over the Uijongbu-Seoul axis. In addition, PVA/KPA artillery positions sighted from the air disclosed a large number of guns generally astride an extension of the I and IX Corps boundary, all well disposed to support an attack through the Wonsan-Seoul corridor. Further, aerial observers had spotted a buildup of bridging materials near the Imjin. Prisoners confirmed these indications. Several revealed that a main offensive toward Seoul would open on the night of 31 December, and an officer from the 38th Army said that the offensive would begin with a coordinated attack by the 38th, 39th, 40th and 42nd Armies. As Ridgway flew into Seoul and visited the western front by jeep during the afternoon of 31 December, vanguards of the PVA 116th Division, 39th Army moved down to the Imjin near Korangp'o-ri to begin the Third Battle of Seoul.

It is one of the oldest colleges in Israel. The college grants undergraduate degrees (B.Ed and B.Ed.F.A.) and graduate degrees (M.Ed and M.Teach) in a variety of disciplines in teaching and education (formal and informal), in the Arts (Fine Arts, Film, Art Education, Art Therapy), Humanities, and Social Sciences. The college also issues teaching certificates for academics and various types of diplomas. History Beit Berl was established in 1949 on the grounds of Kalmania farm as an educational institution of Mapai. It was designed to realize and perpetuate the ideological legacy of Berl Katznelson; after immigrating to Mandatory Palestine, Katznelson worked on the educational issues of the Yishuv as a whole and of the Zionist Labor Movement in particular. In 1938, during the fourth Mapai conference, Katznelson publicly presented his views on the seminary of the Labor movement. Weeks after his death, in September 1944, it was decided that a seminary would be established for youth counselors and activists in Katznelson's name. The institute's cornerstone laying ceremony took place on the second anniversary of his death in 1946. In 1949, a movement seminary opened in Beit Berl, in which a seminar for teachers and kindergarten teachers was also established. In the 60s, the seminar developed and began to focus more on academic studies. In the summer of 1968, at the initiative of the then-director general of Beit Berl, Nahum Shamir, a proclamation was published announcing the establishment of the Berl Katznelson University Institute for Research and Education, and the Council for Higher Education in Israel recognized the seminar as an academic college of education in 1971. Overview The faculty consists of about 600 lecturers active in all fields of teaching and research, and over 8,000 students studying in three faculties and the Keshet Center for Professional Development: *Faculty of Education *HaMidrasha ‚Äì Faculty of the Arts *Faculty of Society and Culture From 2008-2020, Tamar Ariav was President of the College. Yuli Tamir, an Israeli academic and former politician, became President in October 2020. Faculty of Education The Faculty of Education, headed by Dean Ilana Paul-Binyamin, combines many fields under one roof. It provides a framework for undergraduate studies in teaching, a master's degree in education counseling, education planning and evaluation, learning disabilities: assessment and educational intervention, management and organization of educational systems, support of at-risk and distressed youth, teaching and learning: languages and education and Arab heritage. Academics are offered various teacher training programs and a master's program in teaching secondary school. The facility offers innovative educational studies and operates support programs and resources for the teacher training processes, as well as the processes of entering the profession. The Arab Academic Institute for Education- The institute, which operates within the framework of the Faculty of Education, was established in 1971 and since 1981 has been operating within the Beit Berl College. The institute offers a variety of tracks and courses for an undergraduate degree in teaching (B.Ed.) in various teaching subjects taught in Israel's Arab schools in special education, early childhood, primary school, secondary school and informal education.  Faculty of the Arts HaMidrasha School of Art was established in 1946 and operated as a night school. The name was later changed to reflect its educational goals, i.e. training art teachers. Among the administrators were Arieh Elwell, Nahum Gutman, Moshe Avigal and Aharon Avni. In 1964, HaMidrasha was recognized by the Ministry of Education and Culture. In 1966, Ran Shechori was appointed to head the college, serving in this position until 1980. Under the leadership of Shechori, HaMidrasha moved to buildings in Herzliya in 1972, which were made available to the Ministry of Education and Culture by the municipality. In 1977 HaMidrasha moved again, this time to Ramat Hasharon. That same year, the Institute for the Training of Arts Teachers was established within HaMidrasha. Following the end of Shechori's term, in 1980, Shlomo Vitkin was appointed director of HaMidrasha and stayed in the role until 1997. During his tenure, in 1987, HaMidrasha merged with Beit Berl College. In 1989, the ‚ÄúOpen Graduate School‚Äù art curriculum was established, which today is called the ‚ÄúIndividual Curriculum in Art‚Äù. In the same year, the Department of Art Therapy was also established. In 1995, HaMidrasha moved to a dedicated campus in the ‚ÄúKalmania‚Äù complex at Beit Berl College. In 1997 Yair Garbuz replaced Vitkin as head of HaMidrasha. Uri Hakem was appointed director of the art school. In 1999, HaMidrasha became an academic institution and received accreditation from the Council of Higher Education to award a B.Ed. F.A. in Art. In 2008, HaMidrasha received approval from the Council for Higher Education for its Master's program in Art Education (M.Ed.). In 2019, artist Doron Rabina was appointed head of the school and an undergraduate Film Studies program (B.Ed.F.A.) opened. In 2010, a program for continuing studies in art was opened, headed by Roee Rosen, and the head of its theoretical studies was the curator Yehoshua Simon. In 2011, the preparatory program for art studies in the Arab sector was opened. In 2013, the Master's Program in Art Education received a final degree certificate. Later that year, Beit Berl College moved to an institutional building, and the official name of HaMidrasha became HaMidrasha ‚Äì Faculty of the Arts. Doron Rabina was appointed Dean of the Faculty. In the same year, the Graduate School received a certificate to grant undergraduate degrees (B.Ed.) in a dual-discipline program that combines a BA degree in art theory with another degree. In 2013, artist Miri Segal replaced Roee Rosen as head of the Graduate Studies program at HaMidrasha, and curator Avi Lubin was appointed head of the theoretical studies program. In 2014, HaMidrasha Gallery opened at 19 Hayarkon Street in Tel Aviv. In 2015, artist Gabi Klezmer was appointed Dean of the Faculty. HaMidrasha ‚Äì Faculty of the Arts teaches Israel's artists and filmmakers who hold productive and lively dialogue with the world of contemporary art. The faculty's programs work to enable the student to develop independent thinking and to establish their own unique artistic path. The faculty is headed by Dean Guy Ben-Ner and includes the Art Department, the Film Department, and the Department of Art Therapy. The Art Department is the only institution in Israel that combines Fine Art studies with the training of artists-teachers towards a bachelor's degree, a graduate of Arts Teaching, as well as the dual-discipline program for teaching of art theory and another field of the student's choice from the Faculty of Society and Culture. The Department of Art also includes the master's degree program in Art Education, the Master of Art Therapy program-Visual Arts, the program of continuing education for young artists who have received their undergraduate degree, and certificate studies in art.

Biography Bennett was born in Philadelphia. He invented an extensive exercise regime of self-care that involved muscular contraction and relaxation exercises for rejuvenating the body.Stark, James F. (2018). Replace them by Salads and Vegetables: Dietary Innovation, Youthfulness, and Authority, 1900‚Äì1939. Global Food History 4 (2): 130‚Äì151. His ideas were popularized in the San Francisco Chronicle in 1906 and in two books. Bennett added medical diagrams of the muscles and organs of the body to his descriptions of exercise routines.Katz, Stephen. (1996). Disciplining Old Age: The Formation of Gerontological Knowledge. University Press of Virginia. p. 92. Bennett claimed that his exercise regime gave him youthful vigour and made him healthy and stronger. His exercises could be carried out in bed for a quarter or half-hour.R. T. H. (1909). Exercising in Bed. By Sanford Bennett. Nature 79: 339.

Human rights are the basic rights of every citizen in every country. In Italy, human rights have developed over many years and Italy has education on human rights. In addition, Italy has specific human rights for women, children and LGBT people. There are some organizations support human rights in Italy. TOC Developments of human rights in Italy Contributing significant efforts to the protection of human rights, the activists and defenders of human rights are regarded as a central role by Italy, which would promote human rights and support victims whose fundamental freedoms or human rights are abused. Vittorio Arrigoni, Sergio D‚ÄôElia, Josip Ferfolja and some other individuals are considered as active human rights defenders and activists who engaged in series of events of human rights rights protections and have promoted progress in this field. Both activists and defenders of human rights are supported and Italy is committed to defending rights and safety of these individuals and groups so as to enhance their efforts as well as their partners. Italy, together with EU and follows the OSCE guidelines, currently continue to support activists and defenders of human rights for the whole civil society. = Human rights education = Human rights education is set up as a fundamental instrument in Italy, which aims at promoting the awareness of rights as well as the means of using them as protect among citizens. The instrument also tries to enhance respect for human dignity, fostering the mutual understanding as well as strengthening the protection on fundamental freedom of individuals via ensuring their human rights in the society. The education is carried in both formal and informal institutions to train the Italian citizens to protect and promote human rights within every life stage. In 2018, the ‚ÄúResponsibility to Protect‚Äù was designed and launched by Italian government as a school project to promote the student awareness of protecting fundamental freedom and human rights. Human rights in Italy = Freedom of belief and faith = Annually, Italy coordinates with the member states in EU to work on the Resolution about the rights of religion and belief, denouncing various intolerance and discrimination on the aspect of religious issues. Italy set up a mention according to the EU Guidelines on the Freedom of Religion and Belief to support actions against Third Countries on the aspect of freedom or religion at the EU's level. Meanwhile, these guidelines indicate the rights to exercise the freedom of religion collectively, aiming at safeguarding groups with minority religions. In 2017, the initiatives on freedom of religion and belief were discussed and promoted within Italian G7 Presidency as well as its mandate. In addition, with the support of France, a Security Council Resolution for protecting cultural heritage and fighting against illegal transaction of cultural relics was promoted in 2017. The resolution gained unanimous approval and was adopted in March the same year. On the aspect of fighting against religious violence, the resolution refers to key provisions that aims at helping promote ethnic and religious diversity nationally in the long run. = Capital punishment = No death penalty The Italian constitution of 1947 prohibits capital punishment outside of military law in wartime. The highest priority is attached to the international campaign as a moratorium on capital punishment. Since 1990's, several initiatives have been promoted to achieve a universal moratorium on the death penalty. The UN General Assembly adopted the moratorium in 2007 and the resolution was approved by great number of votes. After that, the UN General Assembly have approved the resolutions every two years. The last adopted resolution on the moratorium of death penalty was in 2018. The resolution was voted with 121 favors, which was the highest number of ‚Äúfavor‚Äù in the records so far. In 2014, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation called up representatives from organizations of civil society, asking for coordinating the country's action so as to promote its effectiveness in improving awareness within third countries to obtain their positive responses for the UN resolution the moratorium before the Third Committee made a vote on it. = Discrimination = The main aspects included in discrimination at the civil level currently are antisemitism, racism and sexism. Italy has launched series of laws and codes which fight against discrimination and protect the human rights and fundamental freedom of the vulnerable and minority groups in different stage of history. = Women's rights = Italy is committed to promote the gender equality and empowerment of female in the country‚Äîas part of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Italy is a participants who support and promote the rights of women in workplace, society and family. The related issues and improvement are promoted within the UN every year. Italy pushed the Council of Europe Convention on protect female from violence which came into effect in 2014. In 2016, the Third National Action Plan was adopted for nationally implementing the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. = Rights of LGBT individuals = Same-sex sexual activity has been legally approved in Italy since 1890, though some of the previously independent states that made up the Kingdom of Italy had already legalized it. The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender have changed since 1890 when same-sex sexual activity of both male and female has been legal and a new Penal Code was issued. In 2016, Italy passed a civil unions law to provide rights of marriage to the same-sex couples. However, stepchild adoption is still a judicial debate and not included in the bill. Many legal rights are also provided by the same law to the same-sex and heterosexual groups that live in unregistered cohabitation. A marriage between two females was officially allowed and recognized by the Italian Supreme Court in 2017. Since 1982, Italy has allowed the people to legally change their gender. In order to eliminate the discrimination on transgender, especially in the workplace and employment, Italy banned it since 2003. While there is no other issued bills or codes to against the discrimination on sexual orientation or gender identity after that. = Children's rights = Children In Naples, Italy At multilateral level, various initiatives of childhood protection and children rights promotion have taken place in Italy and the UN General Assembly also passed the annul Resolution that promotes and protect the rights of the child. In 2000, regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Italy has implemented principles laid out by UN in 1989 on protecting children's right in armed conflict. At the level of children protection, the commitment of Italy has led to the adoption of guidelines about protecting children's right within the field of both EU and UN protocols. Meanwhile, Italy supports numerous initiatives of children's rights according to the peacekeeping operations by UN mandates. = The international humanitarian law = International humanitarian law (IHL) is a significant part in the legal system for a country which has close connection with her alliances and other countries, presenting the humanitarianism on the social and moral aspect. Italy continuously contributes to promoting the IHL system so as to restrict the effects of armed conflict on international population. Currently, Italy is part of the Hague Conventions, the three Additional Protocols as well as the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, legally constituting the major acts on the humanitarian issue. The first international legal instruments are the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which were to codify the rules belligerent states must observe in the war time. Within the 15 conventions which presently comprises the ‚ÄúHague law‚Äù, are of specific relevance: the second Hague Convention of 1899 related to the Laws and Customs of War on Land; the fifth and thirteenth ones of 1907 that builds the duties and rights of neutral powers and individuals in order to resolve issues during war on land and sea warfare respectively. The signatory nations that oblige the First and Second Geneva Conventions have the duties to protect populations of the wounded, sick, shipwrecked as well as proved shelter and medical personnel and hospitals. The treatment of war prisoners and the rules of protect civilians, who are captured by enemy or in an occupied territory, are regulated in the Third Geneva Convention and the Fourth Geneva Conventions respectively. There were two additional Protocols were approved. One was the First Additional Protocol which completes the rules on the duties during the war and this protocol perfected the Fourth Geneva Convention as well (such as prohibiting attacking the civilians). In addition, the Second Additional Protocol issued the duties of protecting non-international victims, developing and completing the Geneva Conventions. Approved in 2005, the Red Crystal (a new emblem) the Third Additional Protocol was introduced into using for the war period by international humanitarian organizations. The emblem is regarded as an alternative symbol of the traditional ones (including the Red Cross and Crescent) and it cannot be confused with any symbols of religions. Italian Red Cross and Italy has an institutional cooperation for a long history under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross. At present, International Humanitarian Law must face complex and emerging challenges, e.g. the territory under the control of terrorist groups; protecting the humanitarian labors; the potential threats from cyber-attacks; the increased number of non-State actors. On one side, these new challenges ask the improvement of crisis diplomacy at the preventive level as well as the new political solutions which deal with continuous conflicts. On the other side, the regulations of Geneva Conventions need further respect and enforcement. The country supports initiative in order to strengthen the present instruments, ensuring the respect of International Humanitarian Law as well as to identify the new ones of International Humanitarian Law protection. Italy particularly cooperates with the institute of International Humanitarian Law in Sanremo, which is one of the most authorized organization works as a training center of army personnel in the field of International Humanitarian Law.  Current issues  = Torture = Italy ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1989. The Italian code finally criminalized torture in 2017. However, the law against torture remains behind international standards, and prosecutions for torture and misconduct committed by police are unlikely to occur unless further reforms are made. = Rights of refugees = Italy receives the most refugees and migrants out of any European country, mostly consisting of refugees from Libya and elsewhere in Africa. While some reception centers for refugees provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and medical care, some others are overcrowded and have very poor sanitation and maintenance. While over 119,000 migrants reached Italy safely in 2017 (down from over 180,000 in 2016), over 2,800 were estimated to have died crossing the Mediterranean sea.  Cooperation with Libyan government  To try to stem the flow of refugees entering Italy via Libya's ports on the Mediterranean sea, the Italian government has cooperated since 2017 with the Libyan government, providing the Libyan coast guard with boats and other means of support to control the flight of refugees. This has continued despite reports of severe mistreatment of refugees at the hands of Libyan authorities. Libyan vessels, donated by Italy, have been recorded disrupting rescue missions at sea and leaving struggling migrants to drown. = Asylum seekers = In 2017, close to 130,000 people sought asylum in Italy. Over 40% of these individuals received protection on the first attempt. In autumn of that year, Italian prosecutors began a trial of several officials responsible for deporting the relatives of Kazakh dissident Mukhtar Ablyazov, indicting the responsible judge and three policemen for the crimes of kidnapping, false statements, and abuse of power. Representative human rights organizations = Antigone Association = Founded in 1991, the head office of Antigone Association is in Rome. As a non-governmental association, the association makes efforts to protect the civil rights of individuals and guarantee the effectiveness as well as the justice of penal system. By debating on the models of criminality and law, the association fuels the evolution of legal system in Italy. In addition, it promotes campaigns of resources and understandings on issues related to legal culture in Italy. The shareholders Assembly, the president and some other government representatives are the national organs of the Antigon. = International Institute of Humanitarian Law (IIHL) = Founded in 1970, the organization is a non-profit and independent institute. The head office of IIHL is in Villa Ormond, Sanremo, Italy. Meanwhile, there is a liaison office that built in Geneva, Switzerland. The major task and aim of the institute is to promote and improve the development of human rights and humanitarian law at the international level as well as guarantee the effectiveness and improvements of immigration law, refugee law and relative issues. IIHL also coordinates with several international organizations, such as International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and the International Organization for Migration, to provide humanitarian help to individuals at the international level. = No Peace Without Justice = Founded in 1993, No Peace Without Justice is a non-profit organization based in Rome. The main purpose of the organizations is to deal with issues related to international criminal and eliminate short-term conflicts, stop fighting as well as guarantee fundamental freedoms and human rights at the international level. Since 1993, the original core activities of No peace Without Justice were set up to support the mandates of permanent International Criminal Court and improve the effectiveness of justice system on the aspect of dealing with crimes against humanity.

He is also a composer, a producer and a researcher. He is trained as an ethnomusicologist, specialized in traditional folk music. He performs together with his band K:H:H:L, which stands for ‚Äòthe bones of dead horses out of control‚Äô. Early life During 1993‚Äì94 K√§ppi spent a year in the United States as an exchange student. He was 17 years old at the time. The son of his host family was a fan of Grateful Dead, and through him K√§ppi got to know the music of the band, which consisted of rock and improvised music that was based on folk music. This got him turned on to the sources of that music and especially on Finnish folk music. Another important influence for K√§ppi has been V√§rttin√§, which caused him to look into the folk music collections of his local library. In 1997, K√§ppi got a chance to study folk music in Kaustinen, at the Ala-K√∂nni Folk High School, where he began to play the jouhikko. At the time, he was frustrated with the guitar and felt it had too many strings and too much of everything in general. In 1998, K√§ppi played in the streets with a friend, who played the bagpipe. The sound of the jouhikko could barely be heard, and K√§ppi felt he needed an amplifier. The device had to be a small one, so he could carry it around, but the result was that he had to crank it up, thus producing a distorted sound. This is how he found his own sound, which has been almost unchanged ever since then. Solo career K√§ppi released his debut record, a four-song EP in Kalastajia ja kaivosty√∂l√§isi√§ (‚ÄòFishermen and Miners‚Äô) 2001. It was said it ‚Äúbrought to one‚Äôs mind the field recordings of cultural anthropologists, a breath of air from some mystical past. It had an intriguing atmosphere and at the same time it was aesthetically pleasant.‚Äù Since then he has released three more EPs and two albums of collaborations as well as three solo albums and three albums with K:H:H:L. On his first full album, Jos ken pahoin uneksii (‚ÄòIf you have a bad dream‚Äô), K√§ppi ‚Äúcreates a laudable palette of songs. At first it appears to be a pure folk music album, but that‚Äôs not what it is. The first song, Mariainen, draws masterfully from the delta blues, and the final song, Vanhan virsikirjan virsi 277 (‚ÄòHymn 277 from the old hymnal‚Äô) brings the listener back to Finnish traditions. During the rest of the songs he goes through a rich variety of styles, which one would not first associate with a jouhikko player. K√§ppi's voice, which at times reminds one of that of Tuomari Nurmio, combined with traditional music, brings to one's mind The Incredible String Band. If it is allowed to be psychedelic in folk music, then K√§ppi is the leading figure in it in our country‚Äù, wrote Jaan Wessman for the music journal Soundi. The second album, Vuonna ‚Äô86 (‚ÄòIn the year ‚Äô86‚Äô), gave rise to the following critique: ‚ÄúIt seems that in Tampere there exists some kind of a version of the Star Trekian disturbance in the spacetime continuum. A lot of folk music of other dimensions has originated from there during the last few years. The new release by Pekko K√§ppi, too, draws partially from the same Ugric marsh as did the fine album Jos ken pahoin uneksii (2007), but from a great many other places as well.‚Äù The critique of the third album, Rammat Jumalat (‚Äòlame gods‚Äô), says that ‚Äúon record or at a gig [K√§ppi‚Äôs music] is not only easy to approach but simply irresistible. Rammat jumalat makes it even easier to approach with its stylish band approach, in which K√§ppi‚Äôs multitoned jouhikko rock blends with a hypnotic sound frame reminiscent of the ragged blues of Tom Waits and Tuomari Nurmio. The tones of folk music are just one ingredient in his soulful and liberated kind of organic rock. The compositions are by K√§ppi, and in his lyrics traditional croaking blends with his lyricist‚Äôs heavy message. The riffs swing and the melodies are catchy, and the songs are exceptionally strong. But in spite of this, the strongest ace of the record is K√§ppi‚Äôs voice. He has a sound all of his own, full of touching soul and unpredictable power. His unusual phrasing sounds completely natural. One must look far in the history of Afroamerican music to find similarly convincing singers who sing with a voice of a ‚Äòsensitive bad guy‚Äô. We have never before heard the likes of him in Finland.‚Äù Pekko K√§ppi & K:H:H:L. From 2015 on, K√§ppi has released three albums with K:H:H:L, in which he joined by Tommi Laine (guitars) and Nuutti Vapaavuori (bass), along with Jani Auvinen (drums and percussions) for his most recent gigs. The band emerged from the sessions of Rammat Jumalat, ‚Äúand from the beginning it was clear that the next album would be a band effort. In the critique of the first album, Sanguis Meus, Mama!, it was said that ‚ÄúK√§ppi understands the connection between the original Ugric spirit and the blues. There are riffs and rhythmic patters here into which one could run on the records of Tuareg bands. The rock set up woven so cleverly fits in well with these spells. Laine plays splendidly with his acoustic slide guitar, but at times he also tears up distorted riffs that would gain approval from The Black Keys. The dialogue between the jouhikko and the guitar, with intertwining comments from synthesizers, grows into an ever greater role the more one listens to this record. The rhythm is augmented with great taste with drum machines. But I would venture to say that a skillful drummer would add to the value of this hypnotic and at times funky material. If K√§ppi‚Äôs voice is still a little boyish and clean, his texts, aware of traditions, are all the heavier. One can sense a powerful smell of revenge, destitution and death in them.‚Äù Sanguis Meus, Mama! managed to popularize K√§ppi voodoo concoction, cooked from folk music and blues, into a nearly perfect fit, suitable even for the radio waves. The second album, Matilda, did not fare quite as well with the critics as the first one did. ‚ÄúIf Sanguis Meus, Mama! leaned quite heavily to pop music, then Matilda did so even more heavily. However, K√§ppi‚Äôs newest concoction causes one to wrinkle one‚Äôs nose at it, as the album is not as good as its predecessor. ‚Ä¶ But Matilda is still quite a good record. It‚Äôs only that Sanguis Meus, Mama! is so good that not many artists are able to create anything like it during their whole careers, so it is natural to feel disappointed here. One can safely say even now that Matilda is much better than most Finnish pop records will be this year. K√§ppi‚Äôs voodoo pop is on its own orbit.‚Äù The third album was likewise reviewed positively. Soundi writes that ‚ÄúPekko K√§ppi and his band make interesting music on their third album, and they are still rocking wildly. It feels strongly that the best elements on their previous efforts have now found their rightful places here. The first song, ‚ÄúIkoni‚Äù (‚ÄòIcon‚Äô), with its pop tones makes one smile, and its mantra like rhythm makes one‚Äôs body move to it.‚Äù Helsingin Sanomat writes that ‚Äúat the start of the year we have a folk music hit. An incredibly catchy, intriguingly strange five and a half minute song, which one wants to listen to time and again. This is the song ‚ÄòIkoni‚Äô from the coing album by Pekko K√§ppi & K:H:H:L entitled V√§√§r√§ laulu (‚ÄòThe wrong song‚Äô).‚Äù It has been said that the jouhikko sound on the last record is reminiscent of Jimmy Page‚Äôs sound, especially when the latter played his guitar with a bow. Another influence has been Nirvana‚Äôs MTV Unplugged in New York in which K√§ppi was impressed by the accordion playing of Krist Novoseliƒá.

It had been under development by Visceral Games since around 2013 and set to be published by Electronic Arts before its cancellation in 2017. The project was led by the creator of the Uncharted series, Amy Hennig. It is a linear game about a large-scale heist, taking place in the wake of events of Star Wars IV: A New Hope. Motive Studios and EA Vancouver had assisted the game's development. Visceral Games was shut down by Electronic Arts on October 17, 2017, and the game's development was rebooted by EA Vancouver to become an open world title. Despite this, the project was reportedly cancelled. Development In early 2013, Disney had acquired Lucasfilm and shut down its game development studio LucasArts. EA quickly made a deal to help develop lucrative Star Wars games through three of its studios, including Visceral. Visceral was working on Jamaica, a pirate- themed project at that time. EA cancelled the Jamaica project in favor of a Star Wars game. The studio opted to pitch a third-person action game that maintained the spirit of Jamaica, having players play as \\"space scoundrels\\" in an open-world-style Star Wars universe, and code-named this project as Yuma. Amy Hennig, the writer for the first three Uncharted games from Naughty Dog, was brought into EA for Visceral as creative lead and to help write the story for Yuma. Battlefield Hardline became a company-wide priority for the studio as its development became troubled in 2014. The switch to a different engine, style of gameplay, and narrative caused Yumas production to stall, and by the time Hardline was released, Hennig no longer wanted to do a non-linear game but instead return to a strongly linear narrative game. Hennig stated that as she started the project, she found both Star Wars and Uncharted were based on pulp adventures, but while Uncharted had its roots in the single-protagonist Indiana Jones, Star Wars was more akin to heist films with an ensemble cast, comparable to The Dirty Dozen or Where Eagles Dare. These filmed shared the same nature of a haphazard group of people coming to work together to pull off a stint, thus leading her to give the project the name Ragtag. This effectively became a new game, maintaining the \\"space scoundrel\\" approach and making it about a large-scale heist, taking place in the wake of events of Star Wars IV: A New Hope, fitting into the canon of the series amid the anthology films and animated series. Gameplay would have included the player switching between multiple character viewpoints, akin to the format used in the Star Wars films, as parts of the heist came together. Several of the former Visceral employees called the game's goal's \\"lofty\\", and there was significant trouble in adapting the Frostbite engine for third-person shooters. They also stated that there were several creative gates they had to pass with Disney/Lucasfilm for character design and art assets, and described internal conflicts with Hennig, believing that she wanted strong creative control of the game. After Hardline finally shipped in 2015, EA let go of Visceral's General Manager Steve Papoutsis and replaced him with Larry Probst's son, Scott. Wanat and Bagwell left as well in 2015 to co-found Outpost Games. EA further flattened the structure at Visceral to give the creative leads more power, mirroring the structure at Naughty Dog. Half of the team was assigned to Ragtag, and the rest to downloadable content for Hardline. At the time that pre-production started on Ragtag in mid-2015, about 30 employees were assigned to it, with plans to bring the remaining 30 aboard once they completed Hardline. Such numbers were too small for a large game, and to avoid having to lure in more programmers to the San Francisco area and its high cost-of-living, they established Motive Studios in Montreal, led by Jade Raymond, the original producer of the Assassin's Creed series, with their first project to work with Visceral on the Star Wars title. This added an additional 70 people to Ragtags development team. Around that time, tensions between Visceral and EA arose over the direction of the game on two issues: the lack of any recognized Star Wars characters or Jedi force powers despite having been given creative freedom to create new characters from Disney/Lucasfilm, and the expectation that Ragtag would be a critically praised game with a high Metacritic score as to challenge the upcoming Uncharted 4. Cancellation EA released Star Wars Battlefront in November 2015, which was extremely successful. Because of this, Visceral found that EA started to draw away from Ragtag, and instead funnel more of its studios into Battlefronts sequel, Star Wars Battlefront II; Motive Studios were taken off Ragtag, and Visceral was not allowed to hire additional staff. During 2016, EA laid off some of Visceral's staff, and others left for other positions, leaving Ragtags development stalled. Visceral knew they had to make a good game demo to get further development funding from EA, and began work on this in 2016. Part of this demo was shown at E3 2016 in June of that year. With more of Visceral's staff leaving, EA opted to bring its EA Vancouver team to help with Ragtags development. While this provided extra man-power to expand the demo, the new structure enforced in Visceral made it seem to the developers that EA was positioning EA Vancouver to take over the project. The team presented its internal demo to EA for a gate review in April 2017, and were given the green light to continue development, with expectations to have another review six months later. Visceral worked to get the demo in place, and showed it to EA in mid-October 2017, but based on the state of the demo EA made the decision to close down Visceral days later on October 17, 2017. According to Hennig, EA had already planned to cancel Ragtag a few months earlier, and only formally made this decision after the October demo. EA reassigned the Star Wars game to its EA Worldwide Studios, led by EA Vancouver, and said they will revamp the gameplay, which had been described as a linear, story-heavy title, into \\"a broader experience that allows for more variety and player agency\\". Impact The closure of Visceral was seen as a sign of the waning interest in publishers in making games that are strictly single player, as many of Visceral's games had been. In light of these concerns, EA's CEO Andrew Wilson stated that the reason for Visceral's closure wasn't a single-play versus multiplayer game issue, but instead one based on listening to player feedback and following marketplace trends. The company felt that the current design of Ragtag was not fitting these changes and that the closure of Visceral and reassignment to another studio was because \\"we needed to pivot the design\\". EA's CFO Blake Jorgensen further said that their company found the game was too linear for what they felt consumers were looking for and towards EA's goal of pushing the game \\"to the next level\\". At the time of Visceral's closure, the studio was down to about 80 staff after losing several over the years, which Jorgensen said was a \\"sub-scale nature\\" that required them to assign EA's Vancouver and Montreal studios to help, and that the closure was primarily a business, cost-saving measure. In June 2018, Hennig announced that she had left EA earlier that year in January. While Hennig had been involved with some of the initial work at EA Vancouver, she stated the new game was more open-world and far different from the title Visceral had developed. However at the time of her departure, she stated that the Star Wars game was stalled and EA Vancouver was working on something very different. In January 2019, insiders from EA Vancouver stated to gaming websites that EA has since cancelled this game. In April 2019, EA announced a new single-player game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, to be released later that year and developed by Respawn Entertainment. Hennig stated that this seemed like a change of strategy related to the criticism that EA received after its closure of Visceral and its strong indication that it was moving away from single-player games.

Shortly after, the series was available to stream for free on both Adult Swim's website and YouTube channel. The series follows the exploits of Makasu, a sportsman and relic thief that constantly challenges the gods of several different religions for their relics, and his companion Back Pocket Dimension Flying Bear on their quest to gain the treasures of the Inca Gods all the while he is chased by Bendy Rivers, a member of Interpol tasked with stopping Makasu. The series parodies anime‚Äìstyle shows, intentionally using rather strange and amateurish animation, constantly shifting quality in drawing style, as well as rather off‚Äìbeat and crass humor. The program also features several other segments in between \\"episodes\\" and parts such as alternate openings for each part, educational material regarding the different Inca Gods, flashback segments of past challenges Makasu has faced, and fake toy commercials promoting the program. The series was renewed for a 14 episode second season, titled Gƒìmusetto: Death Beat(s), that is set to premiere on November 7, 2020 on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block. This second season was first revealed on April 1, 2020, as a brief clip of the season premiere was shown before leading into the night's April Fools prank. This season will have a more conventional 11 minute runtime per episode. Plot =Part 1= The story starts with a flashforward, showing Makasu floating around in space in front of the Sun, heavily wounded, the sun declaring that it is Makasu's serve. The story then jumps back to Makasu traveling up Machu Picchu as he uses a rod to transform the ruins to summon the God of Tennis, who expected the mortal's arrival and knew of his reputation as a deity-defeating treasure thief who gets away with his crimes. But instead of stopping him, God of Tennis offers his services to Makasu since he must defeat the Inca Gods in tennis, claiming the gods are shadows of their former selves. Makasu has strong reservations towards tennis due to an accident involving his grandfather, but God of Tennis snaps Makasu out of it after telling his own story of how the Inca Gods took him in after French Pantheon of Gods fell. Makasu feels ready to take on the gods after training, and escapes agent Bendy Rivers who has been trying to arrest him. Makasu and God of Tennis reach the land of Ekeko, Makasu's first opponent, meeting the match overseer Chair Umpire before the match commences. Though Ekeko initially gains the upper hand due to his ability to summon any gift, including tennis rackets and tennis balls, and in a pompous act, hints he will give Makasu a shirt that says \\"Big Tennis Loser\\". However, Makasu uses Reverse Psychology to create a Fractal gift of Ekeko wearing the shirt, leading to Ekeko's desires to grant the gift sapping him of his power. Makasu easily defeats Ekeko, who strangely is then absorbed into Makasu following his defeat. Chair Umpire then advices Makasu that this isn't normal and that things will only get harder. =Part 2= Reaching the beach, God of Tennis tells Makasu that their next challenger is in the Sea. However, as they relax on the beach for a moment's respite, Bendy Rivers manages to use a trap laid for Makasu to contain him within a bubble. However, before Bendy Rivers can arrest him once more, Makasu has Back Pocket Dimension Flying Bear use Sk√≠√∞bla√∞nir to break them out, crashing Bendy Rivers' flying machine in the process. After being attacked by a strange creature known as \\"the Tricky Colon\\", Makasu consumes it, causing the anger of Mama Qucha and bringing him and God of Tennis to a dry bit of sea floor via whirlpool after Makasu is forced to vomit it back up. Chair Umpire then summons a Tennis Court for them to play on before Mama Qucha is summoned. Furious with Makasu's actions, she shows heavy hostility before their game starts, gaining an early lead by using balls of water for her tennis balls rather than normal ones. However, after a small break, he returns and manages to hit her balls back, having frozen vomit fill the holes in his racket, ultimately helping him defeat her and absorb her power. Being lead to the \\"Under Andes\\" next by God of Tennis, they soon encounter Urcuchillay, who is furious about the group's treatment of llamas up to this point. Though initially mocked by the group due to his eccentric way of communication, he proves to be a challenging match for Makasu, though he manages to defeat the god. =Part 3= Back at Interpol, they have lost track of Makasu after the tracker they put on him when they had him in custody ceases to function after Makasu's fight with Urcuchillay. However, detecting energy from the \\"Colored Stones of N√ºwa\\", they plan for Bendy Rivers to intercept him. God of Tennis and Makasu manage to reach Ukhu Pacha. After a delay from Chair Umpire taking a call, Makasu faces off against Supay. Though Makasu manages to get the upper hand early, Supay uses his large eyes to flood Makasu's mind with the knowledge of many people's deaths he unintentionally caused when he was in school, including the father of a girl who had a crush on him, a tennis coach, a janitor capable of bending time to his will, a bully whom he stole the powers of, and the wife of a bocce ball teacher he was having an affair with. With Makasu now flooded with guilt, Supay starts scoring easy points on Makasu, who is too overcome with his guilt to bother even hitting the ball back. However, God of Tennis intervenes and reveals Supay's eyes are actually quite small by breaking his glasses, killing him in the process as his power is absorbed into Makasu. =Part 4= Still quite shaken and upset from his encounter with Supay, Makasu finds it hard to put the knowledge of all the deaths he unintentionally caused behind him. To try and help him forget, God of Tennis brings Makasu to a bar. With the help of alcoholic drinks, he manages to suppress his feelings of guilt as well as defeat a regret demon trying to feed on his regret. During his hangover, Makasu is encountered by Chair Umpire, who informs them their next opponent is Kon. Kon taunts Makasu, causing the two to glare constantly at each other, allowing for Kon to summon Catequil as back up. God of Tennis is angered as he considers this unfair, but Chair Umpire allows it, meaning Makasu has to fight the two gods alone. Makasu however suggests that he and God of Tennis merge to increase their power. With the blessing of Chair Umpire, the two fuse together and become a powerful being. However Kon is unfazed and merges with Catequil to become a super being as well. Makasu and God of Tennis win after a hard-fought battle, but afterwards the two unmerge, battered and bruised from the stress the fusion put on their bodies. It is at this point Bendy Rivers manages to catch up with Makasu, now under orders to shoot Makasu on sight. He demands Makasu give him one reason to spare his life, Makasu begging for forgiveness. This causes Bendy to go through an internal breakdown of his own motives and reflect on his past. This allows Makasu and God of Tennis to escape as Bendy finally remembers Makasu is someone without remorse, at the same time, Bendy's wife divorces him, leaving him emotionally destroyed. =Part 5= Makasu discusses recent concerns about how his challenges have been going this time around, specifically how he has been absorbing the power of all the gods they've fought up to this point. However, these concerns fall on deaf ears as God of Tennis is too busy, who tells him to just repress everything and keep focused. They reach Hanan Pacha, finding a strange hotel there that God of Tennis does not recall. However they put this feeling aside for now as they enjoy the hot springs to relax and revitalize their muscles. Females of many different types (and one disguised Bendy Rivers) alongside a Ventriloquist start trying to woo Makasu and convince him to give up his quest. Makasu is gradually surrounded by attractive ladies, causing him to flee and run into the ventriloquist. The ventriloquist reveals he has little to actually do with this as he was hired to sing for him and that the hotel seemingly appeared only a day prior. As he continues to flee, Makasu discovers that all the women were artificially made by normal meats. Here, Bendy reveals himself and how he managed to sneak in with the plan of catching him. However, they are interrupted by Mama Killa, the mastermind behind the fake women and the hotel. Mama Killa shows great hostility toward Makasu for the killing of Kon, though Makasu seems to care little. Mama Killa's \\"star child\\" within her at first gives Makasu trouble, however, using some quick thinking, he switches the ball with the Sessho-seki, killing the Star Child when it tried to return it. Makasu then uses this opportunity to steal Mama Killa's fertility, transforming Makasu into a woman and killing Mama Killa. Bendy finally confronts Makasu once more, frustrated that he can never catch Makasu and finally admits defeat, asking God of Tennis to be sent back to Earth as he finally reconciles with his wife to prevent the divorce. =Part 6= Reaching \\"The Place\\", Makasu and God of Tennis prepare for their fight against Viracocha. When they reach Viracocha, they see he seems to have trouble hearing, seeing, and even moving, seeming quite senile from age. Starting with his serve, Viracocha starts the match. However, Viracocha's movements are so slow, Makasu falls asleep, initiating the \\"Nap Clause\\". Makasu, now allowed to use weaponry against Viracocha, chooses to use the Mmaagha Kamalu, a weapon that glows red when evil is nearby. Using its power, Makasu manages to kill Viracocha. However, Makasu notices the sword is still glowing red despite Viracocha being dead, concluding he was the evil one. This combined with the paranoia Makasu has developed leads to Makasu leaving God of Tennis and Back Pocket Dimension Flying Bear behind. Makasu finally reaches Inti, however he finds himself in an empty white room, only accompanied by the Chair Umpire. Chair Umpire explains that while they're at Inti, Inti \\"isn't there\\". Makasu questions Chair Umpire about God of Tennis, only for Chair Umpire to reveal that there is no French Pantheon of Gods or a \\"God of Tennis\\". God of Tennis appears behind him and finally reveals that he is actually a living puppet controlled by Inti, God of the Sun. Here, Inti finally reveals his motives. Just like the others, Inti was slowly dying, but to prevent that, he injected Makasu with a spell that would have him absorb the other gods so when he eventually reached Inti, he'd have enough power to rekindle Inti, ensuring his prolonged existence. Taking him into space, Inti starts to burn Makasu up, Makasu attempting many tricks to avoid death, but Inti incinerates each one, including Back Pocket Dimension Flying Bear. In a final act of defiance, Makasu challenges Inti to Tennis, diving toward Inti, leading back toward the beginning. Makasu questions Inti before he declares it Makasu's serve, burning him alive. Broadcast and release All six episodes of the series were aired over the course of six hours on the morning of April 1, 2019 as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools prank. The series' existence had only been discussed on Adult Swim's live streaming programs and had not received any kind of official announcement prior to the debut. Adult Swim added each episode to their website the following day, and soon after to their YouTube channel in the form of a four-hour-and-fourteen-minute movie. The series' debut was also simulcast on the Canadian cable network Action, which was already scheduled to become an Adult Swim-branded channel later that morning at 6:00 a.m. Episodes See also *List of adult animated television series *List of animated television series of 2019 *List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim References Notes External links * 2010s American adult animated television series 2010s American parody television series 2019 American television series debuts 2020s American adult animated television series 2020s American parody television series Adult Swim original programming American adult animated comedy television series American adult animated television spin-offs American flash adult animated television series American television series with live action and animation Anime-influenced Western animated television series English-language television shows Television series by Williams Street ","title":"Gƒìmusetto Machu Picchu"},{"id":"60490904","text":"Eleocharis cylindrostachys is a rush type plant growing in dense clumps from 40 to 60 cm tall.

It operated from 1877 to 1905 in the area now known as Woodford in the Moreton Bay Region.  Background  Since colonisation, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander people have been subject to a range of legislative and other forms of control. Prior to the separation of Queensland from New South Wales on 10 December 1859, the Native Police were the main instrument of colonial authority and order in relation to Aboriginal people on the mainland. Torres Strait Islander people initially came under the jurisdiction of the Police Magistrate on Thursday Island, and later, for a short time, the Government Resident of the island. After separation, the administration of Indigenous affairs was transferred to the Colonial Secretary's Office for Queensland and from 1896 the Home Secretary's Office. In 1897 the Queensland Government introduced legislation called the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld). This Act created the positions of Protectors of Aboriginals, and in 1904, the Office of the Chief Protector of Aboriginals. The 1897 Act and the subsequent amending Acts of 1901, 1927, 1928 and 1934 gave the Chief Protector of Aboriginals, as well as the individual Protectors, enormous control over almost all aspects of the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Queensland. Prior to the introduction of the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld.), a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mission stations had been established by religious organisations in Queensland and small amounts of land throughout Queensland had been gazetted as reserves for the use of Aboriginal people. With the passing of the 1897 'Protection' Act, all Aboriginal reserves became subject to the Act. For a number of these reserves Superintendents were appointed to carry out the provisions of the Act. Missionaries in charge of Aboriginal settlements also became Superintendents. The majority of Aboriginal reserves in Queensland were never \\"managed\\" reserves; that is no Superintendent was appointed. Unmanaged reserves were usually controlled by the Local Protector of Aborigines.  Mission at Durundur  In March 1877, of land were gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve in the parish of Durundur near Monkeybong Creek. At that time more than two hundred Aboriginal people were camped there under the supervision of the Rev Duncan McNab. In 1878 an amendment to the original notice was made noting the size of the reserve as . In January 1905, the Queensland Government decided to close Durundur Mission. It was closed on 1 March 1905 and the remaining inmates transferred to Barambah Mission. 61 people were forced to walk to Barambah, with the remaining 115 inmates taken by train.

Early life Joseph Gluckstein Links was born on 13 December 1904 in London, United Kingdom, to Katey (n√©e Symons, 1 February 1882 - 29 August 1918) and Calman Links (1868 - 16 August 1925). Joseph or Joe, he was commonly called, had two younger siblings, Eileen Hannah Links (25 August 1909 - 1982) and Joyce Links (15 October 1914 - ). His father was a Jewish refugee from Hungary who had co-founded the fur business, Calman Links. His mother died in 1918 before he was 13 years old. Two years later his father learned that he was also terminally ill. With no time to spare, he removed his son from school in order before he died to teach him the fur trade in general and how to run the business. \\"I was an unwilling and sullen pupil,\\" Links wrote, but he later appreciated that forced him into a career. \\"There was the business and I jolly well had to go and earn my living at it.\\"  Career  = Furrier = While his father had mostly traded in skunk skins and thus the low end of the fur trade, Links after taking responsibility for the business moved it upmarket. In the 1920s, fur was very popular in the fashion world with every woman wanting a fur coat. By the 1930s, Calman Links was one of its most prominent furriers in London, which at the time was the epicenter of a booming luxury fur trade. Even the Great Depression had little impact on Calman Links. For many years the business was located at 33 Margaret Street, London. Calman Links eventually gained the royal warrant and Links was for a period a director of the Hudson's Bay Company, and served as President of the British Fur Trade Alliance. In 1956, Links wrote a book on fur, The Book of Fur. = Beginning of his writing career = Links was a friend of Nancy Robinson heiress to the Nugget Boot Polish fortune who, married Dennis Wheatley in 1922. The two men became lifetime friends and remained so after Wheatley's and Robinson divorced in 1930. The pair shared a taste for luxury, most notably in the form of good cigars and expensive wines. As Wheatley attempted to write his first novel, Links supported him with advice and by lending money. One night over dinner, circa 1935, Links suggested to Wheatley they consider cooperating to produce a murder mystery in the form of a dossier of clues. For a period Wheatley was unconvinced as Links had no background in writing, yet alone game design. Wheatley was by now in demand as a writer, but had no experience in writing detective novels. Worn down by Links' persistence Wheatley approached his publisher, Hutchinson, but they were lukewarm as it would be expensive to produce and was not something they had experience in. In order to keep Wheatley happy, they finally agreed, provided Links and Wheatley would be willing to accept no royalties at all on the first 10,000 copies sold, and one penny per copy after that. Links and Wheatley agreed to these terms. Links planned the mystery and devised the clues, while Wheatley wrote the text of the included documents. As Wheatley's name was known to the reading public, the dossier was credited to Wheatley, with a ‚Äúplanned by J.G. Links‚Äù below in smaller letters. Their first effort Murder off Miami was published on 23 July 1936 at a price of 3 shillings and 6 pence. Initially bookstall and bookshop managers was largely negative as they were difficult to display and it was felt that they were too innovative for general consumption. To over counter this apprehension Wheatley entertained numerous London bookshop managers which convinced them to take a small number. Selfridges agreed to take 1,000 copies, provided Wheatley signed each one, which he gladly did.120,000 copies were sold in six months and it went on to sell over 200,000 copies in Britain in its first year. Queen Mary purchased six copies from Hatchards. It was translated into several other languages. Although there had been ‚Äòsolve it yourself‚Äô crime books in the past, such as the ‚ÄòBaffle Books‚Äô created by Lassiter Wren and Randle McKay, Links and Wheatley took it to another level, by providing a cardboard folder containing all the evidence that an investigating team of detectives might gather. In the folder was a variety of reports, testimonies, letters, as well as physical clues such as hairs or pills. The reader had to inspect this evidence to solve the mystery before checking his conclusion with the actual solution, concealed within a sealed section towards the rear of the folder. In all four 'Crime Dossiers' were published, the others being Who Killed Robert Prentice?, The Malinsay Massacre, and Herewith The Clues!. Some of the letters in Who Killed Robert Prentice? were scented with unique perfumes, providing vital clues about their origins, while there was a torn-up photograph of the victim cavorting with a naked woman. The reader had to reassemble this photograph to obtain a clue. The crime dossiers were very popular both in Britain and around the world. When published in Germany, the Nazi Chamber of Literature and the Ministry of Propaganda took a dim view of Who Killed Robert Prentice claiming that the main protagonist, Cicely Prentice, was a woman whose \\"moral character must be designated more than inferior\\". For many years it had been assumed that as a result it had been banned, but evidence has surfaced that there was pre-war German edition. Beginning in 1979 with Murder off Miami all four were reissued by Hutchinson in facsimile over the next three years, ending with Herewith the Clues in 1982 to modest press notices and modest sales. In 1986, Webb and Bower in conjunction with Michael Joseph, unsuccessfully published the crime dossiers in glossy hardback editions, with the physical clues reduced to photographs. = World War II = During the Second World War, Links served as a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force working on barrage balloons in the Air Ministry. A chance meeting during his military service bought him into contact with Robert Lutyens, son of the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. Through Robert Lutyen, Links, a longtime bachelor met his sister, Mary, whom he subsequently married in 1945. = Venice = Initially, Links proposed having their honeymoon on a troopship going to New York, but Mary's objection led to the selection of Venice as a more suitable option. This first visit for both of them to Venice resulted in them becoming instantly captivated and for the next 30 years, they visited Venice two‚Äìthree times a year. In the late 1960s, Links became involved in the establishment of the Venice in Peril Fund, a fund to prevent the buildings of Venice from crumbling into its lagoon. Both Links and Mary supported it for the rest of their lives. Already an admirer of art critic John Ruskin, Links took along on one of their early visits to Venice, a copy of The Stones of Venice, which lead to Mary writing biographies of both Ruskin and his wife, Effie Gray. = Canaletto = As a result of fascination with Venice, Links developed in interest in Venetian painter Canaletto. In 1962 Mary gave Links a copy of William G. Constable's recently published monograph on Canaletto, which mentioned a missing painting by the artist. Links recognized it as the painting hanging over his sister-in-law's fireplace and passed this information on to Constable, leading to the two men corresponding. When Constable meet Links in person he asked him to take over revising the book for its second edition. The task took Links six years rather than the six months Constable had anticipated., the resulting book Canaletto: Giovanni Antonio Canal, 1697-1768 when published in 1976 lead to Links who was self-taught and had no formal training becoming recognized as a world expert on Canaletto. =Venice for pleasure = In reply to his friends constantly asked for advice prior to visiting Venice, Links would write letters describing what to see and do. One such friend intending to visit the city was the publisher Max Reinhardt, of The Bodley Head, to whom Links provided advice in such a letter. Reinhardt's client Charles Chaplin and his wife also found the advice of benefit, which engaged Reinhardt to ask Links to write a book on the subject. The result was Venice for Pleasure which upon its publication in 1966 received favourable reviews, with Bernard Levin in The Times stating, \\"Not only the best guide-book to that city ever written, but the best guide- book to any city ever written.\\" James Mustich listed the book in his 1,000 Books To Read Before You Die: A Life-Changing List offering the opinion that \\"Links weaves a spell that evokes the joy of urban wanderings the enduring fascination of beauty, the ambience of time, and the pleasure of coming upon a welcoming cafe at just the moment one's feet need a rest and one's mind a respite.\\" A fifth expanded edition was published in 1994 and by 2015 it was in its ninth edition.  Death  He died at his London home on 1 October 1997.  Personal life  Links married writer Mary Lutyens (31 July 1908 - 9 April 1999) in 1945, the marriage ending with his death. While the couple had no children of their own. Links was stepfather to Mary's daughter Amanda Lutyens Sewell by her previous marriage.  Honours  Links was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his wartime service in 1946.  Bibliography  He wrote his books using the name, J. G.

Angle in his book Contemporary Confucian Political Philosophy: Toward Progressive Confucianism (2012). Progressive Confucianism refers to a contemporary approach of Confucianism that aims to promote individual and collective moral progress. It explores themes such as political authority and morality, the rule of law, human rights, gender and sexuality, bearing similarities with other contemporary progressive social and political movements.  Origin  In 2012, Stephen C. Angle, Professor of Philosophy, and Mansfield Freeman, Professor of East Asian Studies at Wesleyan University, first put forward the idea of Progressive Confucianism as a continuation of the Confucian tradition that accepts the challenges posed by contemporary society. Angle's conception of Progressive Confucianism is built upon the 20th-century intellectual movement of New Confucianism. New Confucian philosopher Mou Zongsan's notion of \\"self-restriction\\" (Chinese: Ëá™ÊàëÂùéÈô∑) had a profound influence on Angle, who shares Mou's commitment to liberal democracy and builds upon Mou's idea to develop a framework that goes beyond New Confucianism. Whereas Mou Zongsan did not speak concretely on human rights, Progressive Confucianism upholds human rights and promotes gender equality, pushing forward the anti-oppression and anti-authoritarian regime established by New Confucianism. Political theorist Leigh Jenco characterizes Progressive Confucianism as something that does not stay at the level of \\"a disingenuous 'discovery' of [liberal] values in early texts such as Mencius,\\" what Angle and other Progressive Confucians intend for is to \\"'reconceptualize popular authority in ways that both reflect, yet critically reconstruct, certain Confucian commitments.'\\" Progressive Confucians reject the label of liberal Confucianism. As a school of Confucian political philosophy that shares some liberal values, Progressive Confucianism goes beyond a hybrid of Confucianism and liberalism. People who argue against liberalism in China, for the reason that liberalism was not originated in China, may find Progressive Confucianism appealing. Accordingly, Progressive Confucianism is able to reach a wider audience than liberal Confucianism: both an international audience who cares about Chinese culture and a Chinese audience for internal criticism.  Doctrine  = Self-restriction = Self- restriction (Chinese: Ëá™ÊàëÂùéÈô∑) is an essential notion Angle adopts from Mou Zhongsan to set the overall framework for Progressive Confucianism. In Angle's conception, Mou identifies two kinds of reasoning, one ethical and subjective, serving as \\"an innate moral consciousness that has the ability to directly intuit the basic moral nature of the cosmos,\\" while the other analytical and objective, operating as \\"a cognitive, analytical consciousness that works by distinguishing subject from object.\\"Angle, S. C. (2012). Stephen C. Angle, Contemporary Confucian Political Philosophy: Toward Progressive Confucianism. Retrieved from https://philpapers.org/rec/ANGCCP-3: 27 One's morality and political values emerge from these two kinds of reasoning, respectively. Mou is concerned with the prospect that politics would be \\"swallowed\\" by morality; He postulated that one's analytical, objective reasoning (which determines one's political view) would be overwhelmed by ethical, subjective reasoning (which cultivates one's personal virtue), as shown by the often occurrence in Chinese history that leaders, who \\"claim to have highly developed moral insight,\\" inflict their own moral view upon others, leading to unpleasant consequences.:24 As a check on this usurpation by morality, the notion of self-restriction is therefore endorsed by Mou as an approach in which ethical reasoning, aided by \\"a certain kind of political structure, 'restricts itself' in order to more fully realize itself, and thereby allows for an independent realm of political value to exist\\".: 28 In particular, as Angle explains, Mou's conception is not that \\"a constitution, laws, and rights are merely compatible with Confucianism, but are [rather] required by Confucianism if it is to fully realize its own goals.\\": 29 = Rule of law = Similar to Zhang Shizhao and Mou Zongsan, Angle is also concerned that politics will be ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù by morality. In the classical Confucian society of China, an over- emphasis on morality resulted in absolute moral authority, which gave rise to the oppression that prevented people from cultivating their own moral values.Ma Jun È©¨‰øä, ‚ÄúÂú£Â¢É„ÄÅËøõÊ≠•ÂÑíÂ≠¶‰∏éÁæéÂõΩÊñ∞ÂÑíÂÆ∂ ‚Äî‚ÄîÂÆâÈùñÂ¶ÇÁöÑÂÑíÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ËØÑ‰ªã ‚ÄùÔºå ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂ§ßÂ≠¶ Âì≤Â≠¶Èô¢ In order for individuals to fully live by Confucian virtues, some objective, public structures (like laws) are needed. Angle adopts the term self-restriction to draw a connection between morality and the rule of law. Joseph Chan, a professor of political philosophy at Princeton University explains the idea of self-restriction: \\"In the sphere of politics, rather than acting according to one‚Äôs ethical reasoning and judgment, one 'is bound by laws and works within political processes.'‚ÄùChan, J. (2014). ‚ÄúSelf-Restriction‚Äù and the Confucian Case for Democracy. Philosophy East and West, 64(3), 785-795. doi:10.1353/pew.2014.0057 Thus, Progressive Confucianism takes on the view that \\"Confucians must be open to, even as their virtues should seek to moderate, the contestation accompanying the world of 'politicians and lawyers.'\\" Sor-hoon Tan, Professor of Philosophy at National University of Singapore points out that Confucian ritual (Chinese: Á§º) works together with the rule of law and plays a unique role in shaping a harmonious community.Tan, S. (2004). From Cannibalism to Empowerment: An Analects -Inspired Attempt to Balance Community and Liberty. Philosophy East and West, 54(1), 52-70. doi:10.1353/pew.2003.0058 Tan notes that \\"litigation inclines people toward selfishness by requiring them to think in terms of themselves as being opposed to others, thus undermining trust and reducing the chances of harmonious association thereafter.\\" Contrary to laws using \\"coercive sanctions and punishments,\\" Confucian ritual \\"operates through transformative influence.\\" In order to achieve the harmonious state desired by Confucianism, the external rule of law and the internal regulation of rituals need to form an organic whole in guiding people's behaviors. = Human rights = Angle's understanding of Confucian human rights is based on Zhao Tingyang's normative concept of all-under-heaven.Jenco, L. (2015, October 10). Review of Contemporary Confucian Political Philosophy: Toward Progressive Confucianism, written by Stephen C. Angle in: Journal of Moral Philosophy Volume 12 Issue 5 (2015). Retrieved from https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/12/5/article-p660_7.xml?lang=en \\"Viewing the world from the perspective of the world‚Ä¶requires us to arrive at the universal world perspective through an inclusive process, rather than universalizing a single perspective.‚Äù According to political theorist Leigh Jenco, \\"such human rights may not come directly or solely from prior Confucian values\\", thus making room for expanding Confucian virtues and protecting human rights in the Confucian background. Progressive Confucianism and human rights open up a dialogue between China and the West. Mary Sim, Professor of Philosophy at College of Holy Cross, challenges \\"the connection between human rights and Western philosophy\\".Sim, M. (2004). A Confucian Approach to Human Rights. International Philosophical Quarterly, 21(4), 337-356. Sim argues that a Confucian approach to human rights has both theoretical and practical importance. Compared to the western notion of the state of nature and veil of ignorance thought experiments, the grounding of Confucian human rights is in \\"real relationships in which we join our lives and the moral communities (beginning with the family) on which our agencies depend.\\" This approach also \\"promises a fresh assessment of Western claims and priorities\\". = Gender and sexuality = Unlike New Confucian scholars such as Jiang Qing, who insist that maintaining traditionally defined gender roles are fundamental to social stability,ÊôÆËäÆÔºå‰∏ìËÆø  Â§ßÈôÜÊñ∞ÂÑíÂÆ∂È¢ÜË¢ñËíãÂ∫ÜÔºöÂè™ÊúâÂÑíÂÆ∂ËÉΩÂÆâÈ°øÁé∞‰ª£Â•≥ÊÄß https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1362813 Progressive Confucianism is open to the notion that some aspects of the Confucian human role may be contingent and flexible. In \\"Progressive Confucianism and Human Roles,\\" Angle criticizes a one-sided or overly rigid understanding for roles and rationality because \\"such interpretations fail to capture crucial insights of Confucianism, and they undermine the possibility of Confucianism playing a positive role in the modern world.\\"Angle, S. C. (2018). Progressive Confucianism and Human Roles. Confucian Academy, Volume 5, No.2, 16-33. Progressive Confucianism suggests that a critical and charitable reading of Confucian texts provides a basis for feminist movements and LGBT+ rights. The fluid nature of yin-yang cosmology may support gender fluidity. Ann Pang- White, Director of Asian studies at The University of Scranton and the editor of The Bloomsbury Research Handbook of Chinese Philosophy and Gender, suggests that \\"yin-yang cosmology when appropriately understood does not necessarily support a rigid oppositional split of 'femininity/female/women versus masculinity/male/men.' Rather, since all things embrace both yin and yang, all things embody some degree of both femininity and masculinity\\".Pang-White, A. A. (2018). The Bloomsbury research handbook of Chinese philosophy and gender. London: Bloomsbury Academic. Confucianism has its own reasons to support same- sex marriage. \\"Based on the premise that homosexual desires are natural\\" and with \\"the advancement of reproductive technology\\" in the modern era, Sin-Yee Chan, Professor of Philosophy at University of Vermont, contends that \\"homosexual couples can maintain a Confucian family.\\"  Criticism  Criticism of Progressive Confucianism ranges from the etymological to the philosophical. Bao Wenxin, a researcher at Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, argues that given the layers of meaning embedded in the Chinese word progressive (ËøõÊ≠•), the label of Progressive Confucianism may be a vague one.È≤çÊñáÊ¨£, È≤çÊñáÊ¨£Ô∏±‚ÄúËøõÊ≠•ÂÑíÂ≠¶‚ÄùÔºöÂê´‰πâÊ®°Á≥äÁöÑÊ†áÁ≠æÔºü, https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1697586 Bao points out that other than Progressive Confucianism, the term progressive is adopted by other schools of political philosophy, such as conservatism, liberalism and radicalism. In contemporary China, progressive/progress is predominantly owned by Chinese Marxist philosophy and is a term widely used in the writings of the Chinese Communist Party membership. At first glance, Chinese readers might find it hard to tell what kind of progress Progressive Confucianism refers to. Conservative Confucians, such as Jiang Qing, push back against Progressive Confucianism's more malleable view of traditions and inclusive nature. Meanwhile, Marxists and supporters of the Communist Party of China would object to Progressive Confucianism's support for liberal democracy.  References   External links  * Roger T.

Description Shrubby mayweed is an annual plant with leaves that have an irritating smell. The flower consists of many yellow buttons around in diameter. It grows knee-high and has feathery gray-green leaves. It grows in barren, sandy soils, such as the shores of salt marshes. Ecology In South Africa, it is a weed that can seriously challenge crops, due to its strong smell that repels most livestock and adversely affects the taste of milk and meat from animals that do consume it. Fortunately, it only propagates by direct seeding and therefore spreads slowly. In Australia, it is considered an invasive species.

An attempt to identify the Master as Lambert von Luytge, a painter who was active in Cologne at roughly the same time, was inconclusive. The works attributed to him are rich, numerous and varied, ranging from large altarpieces to small devotional paintings and stained glass boxes.Marga Kessler-van den Heuvel, \\"Meister der heiligen Sippe der J√ºngere\\", Peter Lang, coll. Europ√§ische Hochschulschriften S√©rie XXVIII\\"\\" (no 75), 1987, The size of his output suggests that he was operating a large workshop. Speculation on where he may have originated and received his training centers on resemblances to the work of Stefan Lochner and certain Flemish painters, such as Rogier van der Weyden, Justus van Gent and Hugo van der Goes. Connections have also been suggested with the Master of the Life of the Virgin and the Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece. One may distinguish two periods in his work. Around 1490, he appears to have made a trip to the Netherlands, after which his tones become darker, his composition more precise and his scenes more realistic. These new trends come to full fruition in an epitaph painted for the cur√© Jacob Udeman von Erkelenz, in 1492.

Seberg and her husband later sued Newsweek for libel and defamation, asking for US$200,000 in damages. She contended she became so upset after reading the story, that she went into premature labor, which resulted in the death of her daughter. A Paris court ordered Newsweek to pay the couple US$10,800 in damages and ordered Newsweek to print the judgment in their publication, plus eight other newspapers. =Departure from the BPP= By January 1973, Hewitt had become critical of the ever-increasing domination of the Panthers by Huey Newton. In a meeting of the Party's Central Committee, Hewitt suggested that the Central Committee by that point served only to confirm Newton's decisions: In return, Newton stripped Hewitt of his role as Minister of Education; within weeks Hewitt had left the party. Hewitt remained an activist for the rest of his life. He worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Southern Africa Resource Center, the International Human Rights Coalition of Los Angeles, and the Philippine Support Committee. Personal life Hewitt fathered one daughter with fellow Black Panther leader Elaine Brown. Hewitt was married to activist Ester Soriano, with whom he had 3 sons.

The house is Grade II* listed and the associated farm buildings have their own Grade II listings. History Nantybanw has a datestone of 1625 and was long- thought to have been constructed entirely in that mid-17th century period. Recent research shows a more confused genesis. RCAHMW suggests that a reconstruction c.1600 of an earlier house, was continued by the addition of extensions dating from 1625. The house was reconstructed in the 19th century and fully restored in the 20th. This restoration saw the inclusion of doors and doorcases from a demolished house, Graig Olway, Llangeview, and the insertion of a new staircase modelled on that at Upper Dyffryn House, Grosmont. Nantybanw remains a private residence. Architecture and description The house is of two storeys, with attics, and is constructed to a T-plan. It is built of whitewashed rubble. The architectural historian John Newman, notes the \\"typical but not especially rich timber fittings\\" of the interior. Peter Smith records the house as possessing examples of the \\"typical Welsh ornate doorheads\\" in his work Houses of the Welsh Countryside. The house is listed Grade II*, its listing record describing it as \\"an important early 17th century house (with a) great deal of surviving original detail\\".

Biography Nina Jones was born in the Christchurch suburb of St Martins to Eliza and Charles Jones, before moving to Nelson with her parents where she remained for the rest of her life. She was a water colourist who primarily painted landscapes and botanical paintings, and exhibited widely at New Zealand's local Art Society's exhibitions. For a time she also worked with metal and had examples of her work exhibited in a show held in Christchurch to celebrate Queen Victoria's jubilee. Botanists from around New Zealand sent her samples to paint, a newspaper article of the time stated, \\"The amount of careful labour, the trueness of colour and regard to the habits of these bush flowers as well as the artistic perception of the artist must speak to all lovers of New Zealand native flora.\\" Jones was involved in the arts both locally and nationally. She was involved in the Suter Arts Society since its inception in 1899. This was previously known as the Bishopdale Sketching Club of which she was also a member and secretary (1899‚Äì1925). Jones was involved in the National Arts Society as the Nelson vice president. Jones was requested by the New Zealand Government to submit 30 of her paintings of native flowers and fruits to be exhibited at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924‚Äì25. Jones exhibited at Canterbury Society of Arts and New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts. Death Jones died on 8 February 1926 at her home in Franklyn Rise, Nelson, and was buried in Richmond Cemetery on 9 February 1926. After her death, Jones's works were left in trust to the people of Nelson and they are now held in the Nelson Provincial Museum. Legacy An exhibition celebrating her career as an artist was held at the Suter Gallery in October 1926 and showed nearly 250 of her paintings. A review of the exhibition stated, \\"The exhibition was of a much more extensive and comprehensive nature than most folks anticipated. The fine artistic touch, noticeable in every picture shown, was greatly admired. The collection is unique and the artist's work is destined to be of much value for all time to come.\\" Gallery Image:Earina by Nina Lucy Mary Jones.jpgEarina Image:(Unknown) by Nina Jones ac118.jpg(Unknown) Image:Pimelea traversii by Nina Jones ac114.jpgPimelea Image:(Rubus) by Nina Jones ac103.jpgRubus Image:Rubus by Nina Jones ac94.jpgRubus Image:(Epilobium) by Nina Jones ac122.jpgEpilobium Image:(Olearia insignis) by Nina Jones ac127.jpgOlearia insignis Image:Nothofagus solanderi by Nina Jones ac124.jpgNothofagus solanderi Image:Parsonsia by Nina Jones ac96.jpgParsonsia Image:(Unknown) by Nina Jones ac121.jpgUnknown Image:Coprosma acerosa by Nina Jones ac139.jpgCoprosma acerosa Image:Passiflora tetrandra by Nina Jones ac125.jpgPassiflora tetrandra Image:Orthoceras solandri by Nina Jones ac142.jpgOrthoceras solandri Image:Celmisia dallii by Nina Jones ac137.jpgCelmisia dallii Image:Discaria toumatou by Nina Jones ac129.jpgDiscaria toumatou Image:Leucopogon fasciculatus by Nina Jones ac100.jpgLeucopogon fasciculatus Image:Veronica hulkeana by Nina Jones AC110.jpgVeronica hulkeana Image:Myosotis Monroi by Nina Jones ac115.jpgMyosotis Monroi Image:Arthropodium candidum by Nina Jones ac112.jpgArthropodium candidum Image:Leptospermum scopatium by Nina Jones ac135.jpgLeptospermum scoparium Image:Hoheria by Nina Jones ac136.jpgHoheria Image:(Marlborough native broom) by Nina Jones ac102.jpgMarlborough native broom Image:(New Zealand Mistletoe) by Nina Jones ac99.jpgNew Zealand Mistletoe Image:(Nikau palm) by Nina Jones ac134.jpgNikau palm Image:(Unknown) by Nina Jones ac101.jpgUnknown Image:(Unknown) by Nina Jones ac118.jpgUnknown Image:(Wahlenbergia) by Nina Jones ac84.jpgWahlenbergia Image:Angelica gingidium by Nina Jones ac176.jpgAngelica gingidium Image:Aristotelia racemosa -

The influence of Luca Signorelli is also very noticeable. In fact, a cycle of famous men and women, originally believed to be Signorelli's, are now credited to the Master. Taken together, it is almost certain that he spent time working in Siena, although he is only documented in nearby Umbria. His three known panels on Griselda are at the National Gallery in London.

The purpose in doing so was to have women serve the state exclusively through reproduction and guarding the morality of the state. Women's sexuality could only be understood through the prism of reproduction and motherhood. Defying this could have tremendous negative consequences for women, including being labeled a prostitute, being removed from her family home, being sent to a concentration camp, a Catholic run institution or to a prison. It was only after the death of Franco in 1975 that women in Spain were finally allowed to define their own sexuality. Understanding Francoist imposed definitions of female sexuality is critical to understanding modern Spanish female sexuality, especially as it relates to macho behavior and women's expected responses to it. Female bodies were stripped of their physicality and the regime did everything in their power to desexualize them. They existed for reproductive purposes. Clothing norms were equally restrictive as they were designed to further emphasize the asexual nature of women. Women were required to dress demurely, with long sleeves or elbow, no necklines, long and loose materials. Women were taught that their role was to belong to one man and one man only. Female virginity became very important, and women who lost their virginity before marriage were considered to have dishonored themselves and their families. They could be kicked out of their homes, be institutionalized, or be forced to take steps to hide evidence of loss of virginity by having clandestine abortions or engaging in infanticide. Lesbians were not recognized, as they challenged the regime narrative that women's sole purpose was to procreate. The regime tried everything they could to render lesbians invisible. Despite this, lesbians created their own underground culture.  Francoists defining women's sexuality  Hispanic eugenics and pronatalism were viewed as key components of addressing the decline in the Spanish birth rate and the need for an increased population size to serve the needs of the Spanish state during the Francoist period. Policies around this eugenics program involved bans on abortion, infanticide, contraception and information around contraception. This practice was started as policy during the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, discontinued by the Second Republic and then picked up again as a national level policy by Francoists. Anything that was viewed by the state as interfering with women's reproduction activities and increasing the size of the Spanish population size were viewed as being in opposition to the state. All activities that stopped this began to become defined by the regime as crimes. Because of state eugenics policies, women were unable to define their own sexuality in the Francoist period. Instead, the regime imposed its own strict and narrow definition of female sexuality upon women. They said that women were to be \\"submissive, devoted and devout\\". Femininity in the Francoist period is defined as submission and spirit of sacrifice. Morality in Spain rested upon women, with their bodies being the keepers of the country's well being through moral behavior. Controlling women's sexuality was about the belief that doing so would make Spain a morally superior country. Women were defined in Francoist Spain exclusively around the reproductive needs of the state, with women's sexuality only being allowed to expressed in that context. Consequently, women's sexuality was not a consideration in the Franco period. Women's sexuality was relegated in society exclusively to the realm of medicine, and only allowed to be discussed in medical literature by male doctors. Female adultery, homosexuality, masturbation and premarital sex were all considered by the regime to be forms of sexual aberrations. As much as the regime tried to control women's sexuality in the 1940s, it proved difficult to actually do so. A 1944 edition of Semanario de la SF said, \\"The life of every woman, despite what she may pretend, is nothing but a continuous desire to find somebody to whom she can succumb. Voluntary dependency, the offering of every minute, every desire and illusion is the most beautiful thing, because it implies the cleaning away of all the bad germs‚Äîvanity, selfishness, frivolity‚Äîby love.\\" Women who violated the state imposed definitions of female sexuality put themselves at tremendous risk. This included being labeled a prostitute or sent away to a facility to try to change them into more moral women. Prisons were used as places to try to reshape women's sexuality. Parents in the 1950s and 1960s exerted strong control over their daughters' sexuality. Women's magazines were co-opted by the state to pressure women to conform to the state's definition of sexuality. The magazine told women how they should behave in the context of married life. Consultorio de Elana Francis was a radio program that aired in Spain between 1947 and 1984, where women were able to ask for advice on problems they had. Issues of marital gender violence often came up. The show was created by Angela Castells, a member of Secci√≥n Feminina, Patronato de Protecci√≥n de la Mujer and Spanish League against Public Immorality, Spain's immorality police. It served a similar role, up to and including telling married women that they deserved to be raped or physically by their husbands and that these women should repent and stay with their abusers. Student protests in the 1960s began to be a period where women's sexual liberation started to happen on university campuses. On the whole, these protests though were much more liberating for men and male sexuality than women, who might accompany men along as part of demonstration. \\"Sexuality is not motherhood\\" () became a slogan of many feminists and feminists organizations by the end of 1975. Starting in the 1970s, the feminist movement has started a movement to give women control over their own bodies and reproductive capacity, something which they believed men had historically controlled through coercion and violence. Sexuality is covered in this context using a variety of political and cultural concepts, including abortion, gender roles, violence against women, reproductive health, contraceptives, family planning, sexual orientation and marriage. Sexuality is a private thing which requires the contradictory need to be discussed in a public political and legal context to insure that rights around sexuality cannot be ignored or separated from other aspects that can result in a loss of rights. Feminists have also pushed for a discussion and understanding of these issues and how they impact women's everyday lives. The definitions of women's sexuality in the Francoist period are important for understanding the climate around women's sexuality in the 2010s, especially as it relates to macho behavior and women's expected responses to it. = Physical appearance and physique = In Francoist Spain, the female body was stripped of its physicality and made into a desexualized object. They existed only for utilitarian reasons only. They were things for use by the state to discover female moral and criminal transgressions. Despite Francoist invocations to desexualize women and transform them exclusively into mother figures, society still had idealized feminine forms that were often most visible in films of the era. In the earlier Franco period, this ideal feminine form was one with wide hips, prominent breasts and round faces. It would change, after the post war period, to involve women who were thinner by choice, as opposed to a result of starvation. Physical education for women was often frowned upon by the regime. While exercise was viewed as important for preserving a women's ability to procreate and to avoid health problems, too much physical activity was frowned upon. Some sports like athletics were discouraged because participation in them was considered masculinizing. Because of the support of sport for women in Spain through organizations like Secci√≥n Feminina, the ideal female body type was one that showed her strength. Attractive women were also much more likely to be flat chested. This notion of female beauty and body type was found in literature of the Francoist period. Because women's breasts were largely inaccessible to the male gaze as a result of clothing and cinematographic censorship, female beauty in the Francoist period often focused on legs and ankles. Agustina de Arag√≥n was the first Spanish movie to feature a woman's naked breast. Released in 1950, the naked breast largely passed without comment as it was attached to a nursing mother, and breasts of nursing women were consider asexual. Women themselves had contradictory desires over their own idealized form. On the one hand, women wanted to be slender, but on the other, they wanted prominent breasts and hips and to be voluptuous. Many of these women, no matter the contradiction in their beliefs around beauty, strove to maintain a beautiful external physical appearance for the purpose of finding a good husband. She wanted a body that was sexual, but that also signified she was caring and loving. At the same time, her thoughts around her own body had to be guarded as there were social consequences for appearing vain or coquettish. Good, wholesome, innocent and pure girls did not appear to give considerations for their body shape. Secci√≥n Feminina defines this for women, saying, \\"Is it good taste to exhibit the physical charms when you have a perfect body? It is not in good taste or good manners to display it blatantly; our education and our coquetry will agree to what extent discretion and decency allow us to reveal our charms. \\" = Clothing and hair = A woman on the beach in Costa Brava in 1959. Women were required to dress demurely, with long sleeves or elbow, no necklines, long and loose materials. Women were prohibited from wearing shorts or transparent materials. The regime purpose for this was to try to force women not to gain attention as a result of their bodies. Women \\"should be properly dressed, that is, with long sleeves or elbow, without necklines, with baggy skirts that will not indicate the details of the body nor they grab undue attention. The clothes could not be short and much less show through. Young women should not go out alone or be accompanied by men who were not from the family.\\" Lose clothing was often worn to hide a woman's figure. During the Franco regime, women were required to cover their hair in many contexts. This was to prevent them from showing their femininity and being sexual beings. Veils were quite common among conservative Catholic women even into the 1980s. Women tried to fight these definitions in the 1960s by having short hair and wearing pants. In that same period, straight lines and geometric shapes began to play an important role in fashion, and more and more skin began to be exposed. = Virginity = Female sexuality as defined by the regime involved the woman being the property of one man. As a result, virginity was important, and women were expected to remain virgins until they married. Girls were taught that their virginity was the most precious gift they had that they could give to a future husband. A girl losing her virginity outside of marriage was a moral crime. If a girl lost her virginity before she got married, her whole family could be disgraced. In order for some women who became pregnant to maintain the illusion of being virgins, they had clandestine abortions or committed infanticide. Some girls who found themselves pregnant and not married were kicked out of their family homes by their parents and forced to live on the streets; this was done to save the honor of the rest of the family. Single-sex education was designed to prevent girls from losing their virginity. Despite strong societal pressures during the 1940s for girls to remain virgins until marriage, 32.5% were, according to a survey by Dr. Serrano Vicens, not. At least 8% of girls also had engaged in simulated sex acts not involving penetration with boyfriends before they got married. This contrasted with their male counterparts who lost their virginity to prostitutes or maids and other women in employ in their households. Men faced their own issues as it related to female virgins. Society dictated that they demonstrate their virility and masculinity by having sex with many women. At the same time, they were also culturally charged with protecting women's virginity. Teenaged girls could become wards of the state through Patronato de Proteccion a la Mujer. Starting in 1941 and lasting until 1985, girls were taken to centers run by nuns as part of a state goal to rehabilitate the \\"fallen\\". Girls put into these reformatories were subject to virginity tests conducted by nuns. This was done on a daily basis, with girls forced to sit on a hospital bed where a doctor would ask them if they were a virgin. After they said yes, the doctor would imply they were liars and then put a stick up a girl's vagina to check without her consent. Many girls became hysterical during this process. = Sexual orientation = Homosexuality was, according to the regime, a form of sexual aberration. Being a lesbian in this period was about being forced into the closet with no chance of escape. They hid their identities from family, friends, their church community and their employers. Homosexual women during the Franco period could only meet each other clandestinely, perpetuating a silencing of their voices and rendering them unintelligible to outsiders. The clandestine nature of their relationships rendered lesbians invisible and prone to having collective imagery about them negatively defined by the state and its apparatus. The need to constantly be alert to the potential of discovery of their orientation stressed out many lesbians. It could also lead to isolation, as they cut ties to groups who might discover they were lesbians. This included religious and social groups. Some lesbians could not deal with the pressures they faced and committed suicide. Because of the Franco regime's beliefs about women, including an inability to understand lesbianism, there was an underground culture available for lesbian women. Where multiple men using public urinals was suspect, girls having parties without boys in attendance was viewed less circumspectly as it was assumed by many that they were being pure by not inviting boys. Their invisibility protected lesbians in ways that it did not protect men because many people believed lesbianism did not exist. Lesbians would often use code words, such as librarian or bookseller (), to identify one another. Younger lesbians might identify each other by asking, \\"Are you a comic?\\" (). Because beaches were gender segregated, it was often an easy place for lesbians to socialize. Lesbians created their own economic networks to insure their ability to survive. They also created their own spaces where they could feel free, including placed near Parallel and las Ramblas in Barcelona. Matilde Albarrac√≠n described their actions as they related to the regime and cultural attitudes of the time as, \\"So subversive.\\" There were arguments at the time over the way to be both a feminist and a lesbian. The lesbian political movement at the time largely concluded that lesbian sexuality \\"did not have to be soft or aggressive, nor follow any feminist or feminine pattern.\\" Some radical feminists in the immediate transition period would chose lesbianism as a form of exerting control over their sexuality that had been repressed by the Franco regime. Despite gay men being the more visible homosexuals in the Franco and transition period, women writers would be at the forefront of normalizing homosexuality in literature for the average Spanish reader in the final Franco years and first years of the transition. Women writers like Ester Tusquets were the first to break taboo subjects like female desire. Political feminism that saw lesbianism as a natural endpoint for women began to become a bigger theme in some feminist works of this period. = Sex = Educaci√≥n Sexual by Hildegart Rodr√≠guez Carballeira. This Spanish sex education guide was published in 1931 in Madrid, eight years before Francoism. Sex was meant only for procreation. Girls were taught they were intellectually inferior to men, and that their role was to stay home and become mothers. Education was single gender to prevent giving girls ideas about sex with males. Despite sex for women for any purpose other than procreation being strongly condemned and prostitution being illegal after 1956, prostitution was nonetheless tolerated in support of male sexuality that was defined around their virility. Adultery was a form of sexual aberration. Sex before marriage was strongly condemned, but as a moral issue, not a criminal one. Violating this moral code, especially during the 1940s, could have strong negative consequences for women including being abandoned by their families. Women were constantly being watched and had to behave in circumspect ways to ensure their appearance of decency was maintained. For many women and girls, this could mean that no matter her own desires, she could not take the initiative if she found a man that she found interesting. Some women were taught that their husbands should never see them naked. Conservative married Catholic women would only have sex with their husbands at night in the dark while clothed in their pajamas. Women's sexual pleasure was not high on the list of their male partner's priorities when engaging in pre-marital. In the 1940s, only 2% of women knew about cunnilingus, while 2.8% had given their partners fellatio. By the mid-1960s, sexual activity involving non-penetrative sex was a common feature in middle class heterosexual courtship. In premarital sexual caressing, only 40% of the caressing was done to women's genitals. Carles Carreras i Verdaguer said of the leftist and communist culture found in places like Barcelona and Ibiza in 1968, \\"It was time for the breaking of the family model and, for example, we did not have our vocabulary. People said 'my partner', but well ... The model was broken, even the communes tried to work without models and it was time to 'fuck, fuck, the world is going to end'.\\" These attitudes were not common in student society. Rather, they represented a limited sexual vanguard in Spain's more liberal and counterculture places. Women in PCE were pressured to have sex in the mid-1960s and 1970s to prove that they were free. There was an element of lack of choice if they wanted to prove their leftist credentials. According to Merche Comalleba, \\"The PCE militants told us that we were some sluts, some whores, that our goals were neither feminist nor political nor anything\\". As a result of the rebound effect following the end of the dictatorship, Spanish women are more sexually liberated than some of their European counterparts. During the mid-1970s, the Catholic Church preached that no physical barrier should be present during sex, and that even post-coital washes were problematic as they interfered with the primary goal of sex being conception. The Catholic Church taught the only acceptable reproductive control methods were abstinence and the rhythm method. In May 1978, adultery was eliminated as a criminal offense in Spain's penal code. Definitions of abandonment were also changed, as they were not consistent for both sexes with women previously only being able to claim abandonment if her husband forced his wife to support his mistress while they were living in the same house. On 7 October 1978, the law was changed to decriminalize the sale of contraceptives, along with information on how to use them. = Orgasms = Women's sexuality said pleasure was not important and they had no right to it. Galician feminist Tensi √Ålvarez said of this, \\"It's very difficult, from the perspective of a young girl, to see what Francoism was. The woman had a little less than breeding function and satisfying male sexual needs. My generation was educated in obedience; we did not even have the right to orgasm or pleasure.\\" Women who had pleasure during sex were often labeled whores and prostitutes, either in a real sense or in a metaphorical sense. The regime claimed that if a woman had an orgasm; it was an insult to her husband. Women who had orgasms were often told to go to church and confess this as a sin. Complutense University of Madrid rector Jos√© Botella Llusi√° said, \\"There are many women, mothers of numerous children, who confess they have not noticed more than very rarely, and some have never noticed anything, sexual pleasure, and this however, does not frustrate them, because women, although they say otherwise , what she looks for in a man is motherhood ... I have come to think that the woman is physiologically frigid, and even the excitement of the libido in the woman is a masculine character, and that it is not the female women who have for the opposite sex a greater attraction, but on the contrary.\\" A report published by Jos√© Antonio Valverde and Adolfo Abril said, \\"We can estimate female sexual dissatisfaction between 74% and 78%. This is very clear, that every hundred Spaniards with sexual activity usually within marriage, seventy-six do not find satisfaction; out of every hundred, seventy- six do not reach orgasm and, on many occasions, they have not even known it. \\" = Masturbation = The subject of female masturbation was taboo. Masturbation was a sexual aberration. Masturbation could manifest itself as a physical or mental illness. Father Garc√≠a Figar said of the effects of masturbation, \\"Organic malnutrition. Body weakness. General anemia. Dental cavities. Slack legs. Sweat on the hands. Large pressure in the chest. Neck and back pain. Laziness and reluctance to work and even the impossibility of doing it. Shortening of sexual life, impossible to rescue later. Loss of attraction for the opposite sex and disgust for marriage. Sperm sterility. Null. Retentive. Darkness in the understanding. Obsessions and ravings. Weak will. Inability to sacrifice. Animal hobbies.\\" To prevent girls from masturbating while at boarding schools, staff would come into rooms to check that their hands were not under their blankets during the night. Some parents forbid their children from putting their hands in their pockets to prevent them from masturbating. Energy and purity by Tihamer Toth was a regime sanctioned novel that gave advice on how to avoid masturbation. = Abortion = On 24 January 1941, abortion was formally made a crime against the state by Franco. It had already been a crime based on the C√≥digo Penal de 1932. Doctors who performed abortions could be given sentences of between 6 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months in prison, along with fines between 2,500 and 50,000 pesetas. Doctors would lose any professional qualifications they had for a period of 10 to 20 years. Pharmacists or anyone in their employ who gave any substance or medicine that would be considered abortive could face the loss of their professional qualifications for 5 to 10 years and fines of between 1,000 and 25,000 pesetas. Any doctor, midwife or other medical practitioner who observed an abortion was required by law to report it to the authorities. Failure to do so would result in a fine. At the same time, any sale of materials used for the purpose of contraception or promoting their usage could be imprisoned for between 1 month and 1 day to 2 months. Sex education was also banned, with punishments attached for teaching it. Pregnant women in prison in the early Franco period were beaten badly, often with the intention of causing an abortion. The Franco government found an ally in their anti-abortion beliefs and practices in the Roman Catholic Church. Those within the Catholic Church wrote in support of the law, with Father Jaime Pujiula, Professor of the Colegio M√°ximo de San Ignacio de Sarri√° and member of the Royal Academies of Sciences of Madrid and Medicine of Barcelona. saying, \\"The fruit that is lost criminally would be perhaps the most robust man, the healthiest, the most intelligent to raise the same society or to renew it or print new directions and directions.\\" It is also an attack against population problems. of society and Eugenics, not only the women who cause the abortion, but the perverse midwives and doctors conspired with them to perpetrate the crime for the vile spirit of profit are responsible before God, before society and before the Eugenics. \\" Women could and did go to prison for having abortions. During the 1940s in Almer√≠a, 9% of female prisoners were there because they had abortions, had committed infanticide or abandoned their children. This compared to 20.45% who were in prison for sexual offenses that mostly included prostitution, and 4.9% who were in prison for crimes against authority. The remaining prisoners were there for other offenses, like coercion, crimes against religion, weapons possession or having a false identity. = Contraceptives and family planning = Condoms were illegal during almost the whole of the Franco regime. While they were available in Spain, they were also almost impossible to come by. Some pharmacies did clandestinely sell them alongside diaphragms. Because of their connections to avoiding men spreading venereal disease, condoms were often associated with prostitution. Consequently, buying contraceptives would often be dependent on men to acquire them on behalf of their partners. Women were embarrassed to buy them. Most couples practicing family planning used coitus interruptus during the 1940s and 1950s. The Catholic Church in this period allowed couples to use the rhythm method. As American culture began to influence Spain more during the mid-1950s, Spaniards began to adopt more American birth control methods. By 1965, even most Spanish Catholics thought birth control was a reasonable option to control the number of children women had. 51.5% of Spanish Catholics believed that the rhythm method was ineffective. Even Spanish doctors agreed that birth control was important in family planning, even if 24% of them were generally opposed to birth control. Prohibitions against the sale of contraception in Andalusia in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were largely ineffective as women had various means to try to limit the number of children they had. This was especially true for women engaging in sex outside of marriage at a time when that practice, along with having children when single, were highly condemned by the government. Women were willing to take risks to have sex for pleasure by using some form of birth control. In 1966, the first man was convicted in Spain for selling contraceptives. He was also charged with causing a public scandal. Because midwives appeared to be so frequently involved in sharing knowledge about abortion and contraceptives and performing abortions, the male led scientific community in Spain tried to marginalize these women. Professionalization in medicine would help to further relegate the importance of midwives in Spain. Further attempts to dislodge midwives from the birthing process included accusing them of witchcraft and quackery, trying to make them appear unscientific. This was all part of a medical and eugenic science driven effort to reduce the number of abortions in Spain. Despite being contraception being illegal, by the mid-1960s, Spanish women had access to the contraceptive pill. It was first sold on the commercial market in the country in 1964, where Anovial 21 de Productos Quimicos Schering was also heavily advertised. Women could be prescribed the pill by their doctors if they were married and could make a case that they had a gynecological problem which the pill could fix, but this reason could not be a desire to avoid being pregnant. Its usage was largely only allowed for the regulation of a woman's period. Many married women found it difficult to get prescriptions from their doctors, having only more marginal luck when they sought out private practitioners. Consequently, most of the women who were on the pill were mostly married upper-middle class women. In 1970, 2 million units of the pill were sold in Spain. By 1975, official estimates suggested half a million Spanish women were on the pill. The media, both general and specialized, covered the pill, where it was known as an anovulatory treatment. Its introduction in Spain allowed women's sexuality to be discussed for the first time, especially in medical and religious publications and more generally in women's publications. Despite this, the most popular method in the 1960s was coitus interruptus. At the time of Franco's death, almost all the laws related to female sexuality were still intact, including prohibitions on the use of contraceptives. = Rape and gender violence = Rape and gender violence was a problem that was a result of Nationalist attitudes developed during the Spanish Civil War. Sexual violence was common on the part of Nationalist forces and their allies during the Civil War. Falangist rearguard troops would rape and murder women in cemeteries, hospitals, farmhouses, and prisons. They would rape, torture and murder Socialists, young girls, nurses and milicianas. Regular Nationalists soldiers engaged in similar patterns of rape, torture and murder in places like Maials, Callus and Cantalpino. Moroccan Foreign Legionaries were used to commit rape against women to create terror among local populaces. Women in prison were not safe either; they were also raped, often facing death if they failed to have sex with their captors. The exact extent of the problem will likely never be known as there was less record keeping around women, and quantification attempts have largely resulted in the erasure of women's history. After the Civil War ended, Spanish men returned home to a culture that insisted women were completely subservient to men, and where men were allowed to have sex with prostitutes and otherwise be promiscuous. Women were taught to be subservient and that their happiness was not important. This culture encouraged domestic violence by husbands towards wives, and it included rape. Laws made non-consensual sex illegal in some cases, but there was tremendous social pressure not to report this behavior. Women with Republican ties were often raped until at least the 1960s, with social acceptance of the practice. These women often tried to move to cities to become more anonymous. Prison was also not safe for women. They were raped and sexually harassed there too. Lidia Falc√≥n O'Neill was one such victim in prison. As a result of Franco's death in 1975 and the democratic transition starting, the first protest condemning violence against women was held in Barcelona in 1976. Age of consent laws changed two years later, along with laws about honesty. Men were also legally able to be considered rape victims. Divorce was legalized in 1981. Other legal reforms took place in 1983. Still, rape was not treated as a serious institutional problem inside Spain and victims had little recourse. Historical memory laws in Spain have resulted in more attention about to the violence faced by women during the Spanish Civil War and the Francoist period. The Junta de Andalusia started offering women compensation for violence against them in 2010. Court cases also began to be explored against perpetrators of these crimes, with some action taking place in Spain but most of the attempts to prosecute taking place in Argentina. = Menstruation = Menstruation in the Francoist period was often a taboo subject. One woman related an experience about dealing with her period in this era as, \\"My grandmother bought me the new cotton panties and I put them in my school bag in case I got stained.\\" Women often lacked information on their own physiology around menstrual cycles, pregnancy and birth. They had to learn on their own. One woman described this process during her teenaged years as, \\"Being in a town in Extremadura in the midst of Franco's repression in a town far from the capital, in one of the most backward regions of Spain, you can imagine! I read B√©cquer, Machado, you read what I know! to Baroja! and you said, this world is not my world and what I'm living is not really what I need, you know, they are discoveries of mine, through literature I realized, I knew the importance of women, what I could to contribute the woman for the fact of being, that we created.\\" Another woman said about seeking information, \\"Because besides, I know ... the issue of taking your daughter to the gynecologist, it was unthinkable that my mother in my time took me to the gynecologist.\\" One woman said of using a tampon, \\"The tampax was to hide it and hide the boxes because you are no longer a virgin.When I had the endometriosis they blamed the tampax, but come on, they can not be blamed because they themselves were ignorant, because it was a taboo subject , it had to be hidden and nothing was said.\\" Another woman said of her experiences in the early 1970s, \\"Yes, I could not touch anything, I experienced it in the first person, it was an insane thing in that sense, there was no information or where to see it, it is not like now with the internet, I am 47 years old, the 70s were my puberty, my youth, and that is that there were no women's things in the municipal libraries either, and there was no way to document you, I remember going to the municipal library to see what organs I have, how they work ... and not There was not a book, but none, but the nuns did not know anything either, the things that we know is that, from pure experience, in that sense the first years, just like my mother, until later you inform yourself and good. .. that part you overcome the traumas as we overcome them all.\\" For religious women in the Francoist women, they did not go to church during their period. Women were strongly discouraged from participating in exercise activities when they were menstruating. Some women used menstruation as an excuse to avoid sex. Women in prisons often had many issues around hygiene that were compounded when they during menstruation. Their jailers had little sympathy for the, and used it as just another way to humiliate prisoners. As the pill became more widely used in Spain for regulating menstruation, some women had doctors who would fail to explain its contraceptive properties.  Definition  The Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 1994) and the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing) defined sexuality and reproductive rights as, \\"Rights of women and men to have control over their sexuality, to decide freely and responsibly without being subject to coercion, discrimination and violence; the right of all couples and individuals to freely and responsibly decide the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and the means to do so, as well as to reach the highest level of sexual and reproductive health.\\" The World Health Organization defined sexuality in 2006 as, ‚Äú‚Ä¶a central aspect of being human throughout life encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practices, roles and relationships. While sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors.‚Äù The Glosario de t√©rminos sobre diversidad afectivo sexual published by Spain's Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad in April 2018 defines sexuality as, \\"Human sexuality is a central aspect of the human being present throughout his life. It covers sex, identities and gender roles, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, reproduction and sexual orientation. It is lived and expressed through thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles and interpersonal relationships.

It helps companies to manage their financial activities, such as cash flow, assets and investments, automatically. A TMS is commonly used to maintain financial security and minimize reputational risk. It can be used by a company's internal management, and may be purchased from a technical supplier.  Functions  A TMS can use data to analyze and report payments, cash management and flow, banking and accounting. Its functions are: *Real-time cash management: Cash management aims to increase available cash and reduce shortfalls as quickly as possible. It enables companies to eliminate unnecessary expenses and possible financial risk. A TMS provides a range of uses for cash balances, and can access business accounts at any time. Users can view accounts in detail, including savings and lending balances and transaction histories. *Cash-flow forecasting: This projects expectations of revenue, operating expenses and profit, and is a primary business task. A TMS can predict estimated annual sales and expenses (including time frames), influencing a company's direction. *Payment reconciliation: A TMS' payment- reconciliation software reports discrepancies in account transactions between internal and external sources. Reconciliation automatically ensures that a business's financial transactions match those of a bank, credit-card company or other financial institution for investigation by accounting staff and analysis of discrepancies. The software includes auditing and local work- process approval, standardizing workflow and collating and integrating financial documents for review. *Debt management: Debt may help a business achieve its objectives, and a TMS can manage debt to minimize its cost. *Trade finance: A TMS can manage trade finance, a driver of economic development. It includes lending facilities, issuing letters of credit, export factoring (assets against invoices or accounts receivable), and export credit and delivery insurance. A TMS reduces the amount of paperwork involved in trade finance, and can help free up cash (via factoring) and centralize data. Trade- finance software offers businesses automated processing of import and export documentation, remittances and negotiation. *Technology: TMS software has become more sophisticated to deal with globalization. With a single local function, TMS technology might rely on a spreadsheet or bank system for bank reporting, financial evaluation and lending management.  Types  There are two types of the TMS: local and cloud-hosted (or cloud-based) systems. Local systems are installed on a business's home server, and enable maximum control of features and security protocols. Cloud-hosted systems are more economical, more serviceable and can be deployed more quickly.  Trends  TMSs are transferring to, and improving, the cloud-based system. Software as a service (SaaS, a subscription system) can upgrade more quickly and is becoming more popular. The most important part of a cloud-based system is data protection, and improved data encryption or databases in a country with tight data security laws is a TMS trend; market consolidation is also a trend, enhancing functionality. An increasing number of companies have adopted cloud-based systems, which are evolving in features and security.

A Kammers√§nger of the Dresden State Opera, he sang leading baritone roles both in his native Germany and internationally during the course of his stage career. In 1971 he was awarded the Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau and in 2017 on the occasion of his 90th birthday the \\"Gotha-Medaille\\" (Gotha Medal), honoring him for his international career as \\"Gotha's most famous voice\\". He appears in a number of complete opera and oratorio recordings on the Eterna, Supraphon, and Deutsche Grammophon labels. Life and career Leib was born in Gotha, where he began studying the violin at the age of seven. When World War II ended he continued his studies at the State Conservatory in Erfurt and was engaged as a violinist in the Gotha City Orchestra in 1949. The orchestra's concerts often included opera and operetta, which piqued his interest in the art form. He studied voice privately at first. Then, encouraged by his teacher, he enrolled in the Weimar Conservatory, graduating in 1952 with a diploma in opera and concert singing and music pedagogy. That same year, he made his stage debut in K√∂then as Bartolo in The Barber of Seville. After singing in the theatres of K√∂then, Meiningen and Nordhausen, Leib went on to become a member of the Dresden State Opera from 1957 and the Berlin State Opera from 1961. In the late 1950s he also went on concert tours in Italy, Egypt and Great Britain. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1976 as Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, a role he had sung the previous year at the Salzburg Easter Festival. Of his Met debut as Beckmesser, Raymond Ericson wrote in The New York Times: > Gunther Leib, a bass from East Germany, was a first rate Beckmesser. He sang > his music instead of barking it. He did not burlesque the character, but > gave it a smug stupidity that was all too real. His complacent singing in > the final scene was both original and superbly carried off. Leib also sang as a guest artist at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, the Paris Opera, and the opera houses of Budapest, Prague, Sofia, Hamburg, Helsinki and Stockholm. In addition to his performing career in opera and concert, Leib was a professor of voice at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden from 1964 to 1976 and then from 1976 at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" in Berlin. Twice widowed, Leib retired to Dresden, where he lives with his third wife Adelheid n√©e G√§hler. Recordings Leib first performed at the annual Handel Festival in Halle in 1957 and returned there frequently. Several recordings of his Handel performances from the 1950s and 1960s were re-released on CD by Berlin Classics, including: *Poro (as Poro), Horst-Tanu Margraf (conductor), recorded in 1958 *Radamisto (as Tiridate), Horst-Tanu Margraf (conductor), recorded in 1962 *Imeneo (as Imeneo), Horst- Tanu Margraf (conductor), recorded in 1965 *Dettingen Te Deum (baritone soloist), (conductor), recorded in 1969 Leib appears in a number of complete opera recordings on the Eterna, Supraphon and Deutsche Grammophon labels, including: *Smetana: Die verkaufte Braut (as Kru≈°ina), Otmar Suitner (conductor), recorded in 1962 *d'Albert: Tiefland (as Moruccio), Paul Schmitz (conductor), recorded in 1963 *Mozart: Die Zauberfl√∂te (as Papageno), Otmar Suitner (conductor), recorded in 1968 *Benda: Der Dorfjahrmarkt (as Fickfack), Hans von Benda (conductor), recorded in 1968 *Mozart: Cos√¨ fan tutte (as Guglielmo, one of Leib's signature roles), Otmar Suitner (conductor), recorded in 1969 *Weber: Der Freisch√ºtz (as Kilian), Carlos Kleiber (conductor), recorded in 1973 *Wagner: Rienzi (as Cecco del Vecchio), Heinrich Hollreiser (conductor), recorded in 1974/1976 *Dessau: Einstein (as Giordano Bruno), Otmar Suitner (conductor), recorded in 1977 Leib was also known for his performances in oratorio and sacred music from the earliest days of his career‚Äîhe was the voice of Christ in a 1957 performance of Bach's St John Passion in Italy conducted by Franz Konwitschny.

Since it has been embedded in African American's culture for long time with its negative effects on people's health, and given the healthy trends in modern times, both physically and mentally, it is necessary to maintain body physically and mentally fit. Healthy diets also give necessary supplements to our body. modify traditional soul food within the healthy trends and advocate it. This article will describe modifying soul food in five aspects, including soul food with low carb, soul food with low sugar, soul food with low fat, soul food for vegan and soul food in gluten-free. Lastly, it will give high-profile advocates to promote soul food within health trends. The culture and history of soul food Being one kind of traditional cuisine of American American in the Southern U.S, soul food is also described as ‚Äúseductive, satisfying, filling, spicy, high-fat, spiritual, traditional cuisine of Black Americans, especially southern Blacks‚Äù by African American women. It evolves a long history of slavery, persecution and segregation. To produce a distinctive African American cuisine, slaves that were brought to the USA combined their West African cooking methods with European and Native American cuisine and with whatever foods that were accessible to them. Functions of soul food Troisi and Wrigh (2017) claimed that food consumption of food is not only out of hunger, but also for its emotional, cultural and symbolic meanings. To prove that idea, an empirical research was done to analyse how food works in both physical and mental aspects. After the research, they concluded that people's thought, desire and evolution for particular food depend on their mental association and social psychological processes. On other word, both biological and psychological needs affect food choice, implying that comfort food can be applied in psychology. Factors affecting healthier food choices There are beliefs, barriers and self-efficiency issues that affect food consumption and food choice. Most commonly, people suffer from time scarcity because of planning, shopping, preparation, cooking, eating and cleaning involved. A survey was conducted between 57 Africa Americas to assess their those aspects that relate to healthy eating. It is found that although people have awareness and knowledge about healthy eating, the survey showed that there are barriers that restrict people's healthy eating, with price of healthy food as main barriers in food choice. Another research also showed that barriers of healthy eating comes from not only the price, flavour, accessibility and absence of social report, but also changes in total energy, fat intake and weight. More broadly, a project conducted showed that factors that influence diet and life styles come from individual, social, cultural and community aspects. The research showed that high-fat traditional food preferences, kmmonon frying and addition of salted meats to vegetables are based on ethnic differences in dietary intake and culture traditions. As a result, with those barriers prevent people from healthy eating, the increasing consumption relates to the demand of unhealthy soul food leads to health disparities, such as obesity, diabetes or hypertension. This is especially common among African American, which is one of the largest ethnic minority groups in United States. Traditional Soul Food Modifying soul food to fit within health trends With the improvement of economic status, the number of people who suffer from hunger has dramatically decreased, especially in developed countries. However, more and more people are experiencing high stress levels, overconsumption of fast food and sweets, getting less sleep, etc., which contributes to depression, anxiety, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cancers and so on, especially among African Americans. As a result, more and more people claim that focus should be on the quality of food rather than quantity. Although many healthy foods comprise soul food (f.e. collards, okra, rice, legumes and sweet potato), soul food also usually is high in fat from various meats, especially pork, seasoned with lard or other animal fats. Along with barriers that prevent Africa America from choosing healthy food, they suffer from chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Diet as one of the important lifestyle factors, is important in preventing health conditions, thus recipes of soul food should be modified to be healthy, accessible and affordable, especially in aspects of alternative ingredients and cooking methods. Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension to produce healthy soul food is one example of diet plan, to reduce risks of diseases that caused by unhealthy diet. It maintains flavour and acceptability of traditional soul foods and meet people's nutrient requirement at the same time. Moreover, Food of Health and Soul is another local faith community that ‚Äúsupport families‚Äô interest in retaining their cultural foods while reducing dietary fat, sodium, and sugar and increasing fiber‚Äù. Low carb is also known as low carbohydrate, high fat. Diabetes Research and clinical Practice found that low carb positively affects glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes, triglycerides and HDL (high density lipoprotein). It is suggested that ideal diet requires less than 130 g of carbohydrate a day and claims to be promoted as a permanent lifestyle choice through books and websites. For example, people are suggested to eat green vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and just as well as whole fat dairy and olive oil. = Soul food with low sugar = Desserts with high sugar are commonly consumed for hedonistic rewards, especially among women. However, high sugar intake tends to increase risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardio-metabolic diseases and compromised oral health. = Soul food with low fat = Although low-fat and nonfat contain more amount of sugars than regular products, called fat-sugar seasaw, the UK government announced guidelines that encourage people to consume low-fat products for the aim of reducing cholesterol and saturated fat in the diet. When preparing recipes, spices and herbs can be used to replace sodium and fat for flavour enhancers. Soups are one of good examples with low fat but satisfying. Firstly, they are quick and easy to prepare. Some of them are only need to be boiled with water and simple spices, such as pumpkin soup, tomato and egg soup, etc. They have significantly less calories and also convenient and cost-effective. Secondly, since soups can be cooked with various vegetables or meat, such as pork ribs and carrot soup, chicken soup with spinach, etc. that provide different kinds of nutritions that people need. More over, seen as a comfort food in history, soups help lessen cold symptoms and warm the soul, especially in Winter. As Elizabeth Arndt said, soup increase the feeling of fullness while reduce the total calorie intake. Besides, soups with chowders and stews effectively help meet the recorded daily needs for fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals, thus leave positive effects on people's health and wellbeing. = Soul food in gluten-free = Study showed that gluten-containing food have risks of causing celiac diseases and gluten-induced disorder for those who are in genetically susceptible individuals and there are also people that are wheat allergy. Under that circumstance, Lu, Zhang, Luoto and Ren suggested more choices and variation in the diet, especially for breakfast. In addition, peas with 85% protein have a rich amino acid profile that will be ideal for people with celiac disease, gluten intolerance and other food allergy. Besides, some grains including brown rice, sorghum, amaranth, quinoa, millet and wild rice are also gluten- free in nature. However, the research showed that the subjective difficulty in following a gluten-free diet (GFD) comes from main reasons of age, education level, advice on starting a GFD, duration before discovering a gluten intolerance, food choices and ways of GFD management. Accordingly, education about celiac disease and gluten-induced disorder can be conducted among healthcare practitioners to increase their awareness, as well as early diagnosis and intervention of gluten-induced disorders.  High profile advocates: promotes  People are increasingly paying attention to healthy lifestyle. Although soul food are fast and easy to consume in the fast-paced life, where people suffer from healthy issues, modifying soul food within healthy trends become necessary. To better promote soul food within healthy trends, there are three ways for advocating. # healthy soul food can be used to satisfy both biological and psychological needs. # Secondly, since women mainly prepare food in the family and make effects on later generation, the nutrition programs can mainly target women, as well as people in different socioeconomic groups. # Thirdly, culture can be embedded into diet and healthy eating can be advocated in community level. Under that circumstance, It will be familiar and relevant to African American, helping reach them and change their food choice and intake. # Moreover, the program can embrace culture facility and relevance and consider environmental influences. Food For Health and Soul is a successful example of culturally appropriate approach that effectively reaches African American and promotes their healthy food intake. Since chronic diseases commonly happen on people all around the world, modifying soul food within healthy trends should be promoted not only among African Americas, but also people all over the world. Healthy eating along with regular physical activities, as two main lifestyle factors, can work together in promote health and wellbeing.

The album was well received by music critics with some calling it their most accessible album to date and Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic went so far as to call the album \\"remarkable\\". Composition and reception On the Lam is essentially sludge metal and the band makes extensive use of guitar feedback which was described as a musical theme across the album. AllMusic's Rivadavia went on to say of the album: \\"they don't so much compose music as harness feedback, their songs are barely cognizant of traditional rock & roll structures and utterly ignorant of commercial aspirations, comprising a gloriously disorganized whole.\\" He concluded his review with \\"A dense, difficult work to digest, On the Lam leaves a lasting first impression nonetheless, for lovers of unpredictable, unorthodox, and of course extremely heavy music.\\" In a March 2002 Exclaim! review, Chris Ayers described the album as \\"more groove-based but no less heavy\\" while band founder and bassist Daniel Gorostiaga explained in the review that this was the first album where all band members contributed to the writing and composition process saying \\"It's really the first time we've done that so effectively; basically on albums like Laid Insignificant, I wrote most of the music.\\" Discussing Cavity and On the Lam's similarities to Eyehategod, Gorostiaga said \\"Eyehategod are more popular than us, but I do recognize the comparisons because we both came from the same roots of punk/hardcore and metal.\\" Track listing Personnel Cavity * Rene Barge ‚Äì Vocals * Ryan Wienstein ‚Äì Guitar & piano * Jason Landrian ‚Äì Guitar * Daniel Gorgostiaga - Bass guitar * Jorge Alvarez - Drums Technical personnel * Cavity & Jeremy Du Bois - Production * Jeremy Du Bois - Engineering * Art concept by Cavity * Design and construction by A.

E15 is the postcode of the Stratford district in east London. Having successfully won their own battle, the group has occupied various buildings and supported different individual struggles in order to protest against the local housing policy of Newham Council and for housing rights more generally. Formation Focus E15 was formed when the East Thames Housing Association (ETHA) served notices of eviction to 29 mothers living in the Focus E15 hostel for young homeless people. The mothers, who were all under 25, campaigned against Newham Council's decision to cut funding for the hostel and its suggestion that they took rented accommodation in other, far away cities such as Birmingham or Manchester. Members of the group run a weekly help and advice stall on Saturdays on Stratford High Street. In 2015, they tried to talk to the mayor of Newham, Robin Wales at the Mayor's Newham show in a local park but were escorted away by security guards. This lack of an adequate response led them towards direct action and protest occupations which attracted mainstream media attention. Robin Wales was later censured for failing to show appropriate respect to a member of the public by the council‚Äôs standards advisory committee. He was also asked to attend a mediated meeting with members of Focus E15. The group's first occupation was at the East Thames Housing Association building in Stratford in January 2014. Mothers pushing children in buggies entered the offices and occupied the show flat. The fake living space was converted into a space for a children's party. Awarded funds to create a social networking hub, Focus E15 rented a corner shop in Stratford and called it Sylvia's Corner. The name is a reference to east London socialist and suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst. Carpenters Estate 'Repopulate the Carpenters' banner at the Focus E15 street stall The group occupied empty flats in a block on Doran Walk on the Carpenters Estate in Stratford in September 2014. One flat was used a social centre and visited by hundreds of people in its short lifetime. The protest action drew a lot of media attention and highlighted that even though the houses had been empty for between 4 and 8 years, they were in good condition and could be lived in. This was seen as scandalous by Focus E15 since at that time there were 16,000 people on the waiting list for an apartment in Newham. Newham Council immediately went to court in order to obtain an eviction order and refused to listen to the demands of Focus E15. The Council stated that the Carpenters Estate was standing empty because it was to expensive to renovate and the plan was to redevelop it. The squatters were described as \\"agitators and hangers on\\" by a local councillor. The occupation and courtcase were both visited by Russell Brand, who spoke in support of the mothers. The Council was granted a repossession order and a deal was made that the squatters would leave by October 7. Focus E15 took this as a victory, since the Mayor apologised for the way they had at first been treated and promised that 40 homeless people could move back onto the estate, to live there until it would be demolished. Ultimately, most of the young women were rehoused within the borough as they had requested, but in privately rented accommodation and on 12 month contracts. The building which housed the Focus E15 Hostel was eventually bought by Newham Council in 2016. Mayor of Newham Robin Wales said this would make it easier to care for some of the borough's most vulnerable residents. Individual cases =Offer to live in Edgware= Zineb Saafan and her three children were evicted from a privately rented house in Stratford with two weeks' notice. The council at first said she would be rehoused locally, but then offered emergency accommodation in Edgware in north west London. Saafan refused this offer, finding it too far to travel both to take the children to their schools and to commute for her job as a cleaner at the council offices. The council then said she had made herself intentionally homeless and called the police to escort her out of the housing office. Saafan and her children ended up sleeping the night on the floor of Forest Gate police station. When she contacted Focus E15 for help, she was offered emergency accommodation locally. =Arrested on suspicion of squatting= In 2015, a mother (Jane Wood) and daughter were evicted from their council flat in Kerrison Road, Stratford, because Wood had lost her housing benefit and therefore fallen behind in rental payments. Focus E15 pledged to help them and occupied their flat in April 2015. The occupation was called Jane Come Home, in reference to the film Cathy Come Home. Focus E15 redecorated the flat and held a 'welcome home' party. With the help of her wider family the mother offered to repay her debt but was not permitted to do so. She was then invited to a meeting at the council offices and while she was out the council attempted to repossess the flat. Jasmin Stone, a 20 year old participant in Focus E15, was in the flat at the time and was arrested on suspicion of squatting in a residential building. The charge against Stone was dropped less than 24 hours before her court appearance in May 2015. =Police station occupation= Four members of Focus E15 occupied the empty East Ham police station for one day in 2016 to highlight the availability of empty buildings in the borough and to protest evictions. They left peacefully at the end of the day and there were no arrests. =Bedsit in Welwyn Garden City= Newham resident Elina Garrick and her three children were forced to accept a single room as emergency accommodation in Boundary House in Welwyn Garden City. Welwyn is in Hertfordshire, outside London. She was told it would be temporary but ended up living there for 18 months. After complaining to the council and asking Focus E15 for assistance, she was first offered accommodation in Birmingham and then moved to Basildon in Essex. Newham Council have since stopped using Boundary House. =Offer to live in Birmingham= Sara Abdullah, a Newham resident for 12 years, was living in emergency conditions for 6 months before being offered accommodation in Birmingham, a city over 100 miles away. When she requested a review of this decision she was told that it was an appropriate one. Alongside other groups, Focus E15 supported Sara in her request to be rehoused locally. If she had accepted the offer to move to Birmingham, Abdullah would have lost her job and she would have had to move her son to a different school. Since she refused the offer, she was made intentionally homeless by the council and denied a right to appeal, twice. She then challenged the decision in court and won the right to appeal. In popular culture * The 2014 Carpenters Estate occupation was documented by a photographer for the Guardian newspaper. * Lung theatre company performed the play E15 on the Northern Stage at Summerhall, at the 2016 Edinburgh Festival. It was a verbatim account of the Focus E15 campaign, with a young cast and a theatre decked out with banners and slogans. Written by Helen Monks and directed by Matt Woodhead, the play then transferred to the Battersea Arts Centre, which had originally commissioned the piece. * An all-female theatre troupe called You should see the other guy toured their piece Land of the Three Towers across various London housing estates threatened with eviction. The play told the story of Focus E15, but the directors Emer Mary Morris and Nina Scott saw the relevance for other housing struggles. The play's dialogue is taken verbatim from documentary footage of the Focus E15 occupation. * The all-female Rebel Choir was formed out of Focus E15. It has run workshops and has performed alongside other choirs at the Women‚Äôs Strike Assembly in central London on 8 March, 2018 on International Women's Day. * To celebrate International Women's Day in 2018, cassette and digital formats of a music compilation were made available as a fundraiser for Focus E15. It was arranged by the online radio station NTS. Participatory action research Between September 2015 and April 2016, Focus E15 members took part in and advised on participatory action research performed by Dr Kate Hardy (University of Leeds) and Dr Tom Gillespie (University of Sheffield). This resulted in an online report which was supported by the Sociological Review Foundation. It was funded by the Feminist Review Trust and Leeds Social Sciences Impact Acceleration Account. The report gave the results of 64 interviews with people who had contacted Newham Council in the preceding year about issues concerning housing or homelessness. It found that Newham Council had both one of the highest numbers of people in temporary accommodation in the capital and one of the highest numbers of homeless people rehoused in places outside London. New mayor The new mayor of Newham, Rokhsana Fiaz (elected 2018), promised to rehouse displaced people and also to give residents more of a voice on matters such as the future of the Carpenters Estate. However, in 2019, a woman living in Victoria House (the building which formerly housed the Focus E15 hostel) was hand-delivered a paper note threatening her with homelessness. Fiaz commented that the incident \\"undermines every thing we are working towards. I feel massively let down and ashamed that this happened.\\" References Organisations based in London Homelessness in the United Kingdom Organisations based in the London Borough of Newham Squatting in the United Kingdom Social centres in the United Kingdom Housing in England Poverty in England 2013 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Focus E15"},{"id":"60492508","title":"Zoran Radmiloviƒá Award"},{"id":"60492525","text":"Turkka is a Finnish-language surname.

A total of 12 Israeli settlements were established along the Gulf of Aqaba and in the northeast portion, just south of the Gaza Strip. The peninsula was returned to Egypt in stages beginning in 1979 as part of the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty.\\"Upon completion of the interim withdrawal provided for in Annex I, the parties will establish normal and friendly relations, in accordance with Article III (3).\\" Israel dismantled eighteen settlements, two air force bases, a naval base, and other installations by 1982, including most oil resources under Israeli control. History Israeli forces first seized the Egyptian Sinai during the Suez Crisis of October‚ÄìNovember 1956. Under heavy international pressure, Israeli forces withdrew in March 1957, after heavily mapping the territory and placing secret supply caches in preparation for the next war. As part of the conditions for the Israeli withdrawal, the Sinai was demilitarized and the UNEF peacekeeping force was established there to police the border between Israel and Egypt. In May 1967, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered the withdrawal of this force and moved Egypt's own troops into the area. Israel, believing war to be imminent, ultimately launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, beginning the Six-Day War. Within three days, Israel had occupied most of the Sinai. Following the Israeli conquest of Sinai, Egypt launched the War of Attrition (1967‚Äì1970) aimed at forcing Israel to withdraw from the Sinai. The war saw protracted conflict in the Suez Canal Zone, ranging from limited to large scale combat. Israeli shelling of the cities of Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez on the west bank of the canal, led to high civilian casualties (including the virtual destruction of Suez), and contributed to the flight of 700,000 Egyptian internal refugees. Ultimately, the war concluded in 1970 with no change in the front line. On 6 October 1973, Egypt commenced Operation Badr to retake the Sinai, while Syria launched a simultaneous operation to retake the Golan Heights, thereby beginning the Yom Kippur War (known in Egypt and much of Europe as the October War). The canal was reopened in 1975, with President Sadat leading the first convoy through the canal aboard an Egyptian destroyer. In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in which Israel agreed to withdraw from the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula. Israel subsequently withdrew in several stages, ending on 26 April 1982.

When the railway line closed in the 1950s, the station was transferred to the University of Carabobo which converted it for administrative use. Location Camoruco is a suburb of Valencia 3 km from the city centre. While the railway line was in operation, there was a tram service from the station to the Plaza Bolivar in the centre. Initially the trams were horse-drawn.

The 55 km route of the Puerto Cabello and Valencia railway crossed a range of mountains. The railway was inaugurated in 1888. The railway was known locally as the English railway, distinguishing it from the Great Venezuela Railway, a slightly later German-built line.Both lines used the same gauge and they were eventually connected at Valencia. However, the Puerto Cabello Valencia line was not the only British-built railway in the country, and the line from Caracas to La Guaira was also known as the English railway. The railway was nationalised in 1916. Rail transport in Venezuela was neglected and went into a major decline from the 1950s, with bus and road transport taking its place. Revival of rail In the 21st century a metro system opened in Valencia as a north-south route passing near the old terminus. One of the stations is called Francisco de Mirando (Rectorado). The metro system is planned to connect to a new railway line to the coast at an interchange in Naguanagua Municipality.

The location of Sh≈çka Sonjuku is 1537-1 Chinto, Hagi city, Yamaguchi. Sh≈çka Sonjuku is inside a shrine: Sh≈çin Jinja (also Sh≈çin Shrine). Sh≈çin Shrine was built for Yoshida Sh≈çin, to memorialize the leading figure of the Meiji Restoration. The traditional wooden building was one of the most crucial origins of political and philosophical ideas, specifically in manners of Western technology and critical industrialization of Japan. The area of Sh≈çka Sonjuku is . It consists of an 8-mat classroom, 10-mat prep room and a earthen floor. The common view of Sh≈çka Sonjuku is that this sonjuku (a place for academy) was established by Yoshida Sh≈çin (one of the most unique intellectuals and philosopher of wang yangming school of mind in Japan). The actual origin of this sonjuku was when Sh≈çin‚Äôs uncle Tamaki Bunnoshin used his own residence to establish a shijuku (independent private school of the Tokugawa system). Sh≈çka Sonjuku fostered many outstanding figures, who contributed to the Meiji Restoration. It closed in 1892 and the guideline of the songjuku was \\"support the Mikado (the emperor of Japan) and resist the imperialism from other countries\\".  History  = The Origin Of Sh≈çka Sonjuku = From the common views, Sh≈çka Sonjuku was established by Yoshida Sh≈çin. There was a letter from Yoshida Sh≈çin to Kusaka Genzui written in 1856. This letter briefly talks about Yoshida Sh≈çin prepared the students of the Sonjuku as a political cadre. Yoshida Sh≈çin was a teacher of this Sonjuku and he influenced this Sonjuku, even that era of Japan profoundly. From the source \\"Yoshida Shoin (1830-1859) and the Shoka Sonjuku\\", there were actually three phases of the Sonjuku. Properly, the actual origin of the Sonjuku was by Tamaki Bunnoshin. = Three phases of Sh≈çka Sonjuku = The first phase was Sh≈çka Sonjuku of Tamaki & Kubo. The second phase was Sh≈çin's Sonjuku. The third phase was \\"The Radicalization of the Sonjuku\\". In 1842, Yoshida Sh≈çin's uncle Tamaki Bunnoshin used his own residence as a shijuku. Later the shijuku was commonly called Sh≈çka Sonjuku or Matsushita Sonjuku. At the age of 12, Yoshida Sh≈çin was registered as a pupil, together with his two elder brothers. Later, Sh≈çin started his travels to explore his country. Yoshida Sh≈çin was back to Sh≈çka Sonjuku and began teaching again after January 1856. Until this point, it was still phase one. Because Sh≈çin was a staff only and his uncle still took control of Sh≈çka Sonjuku. When Sh≈çin became the principal-administrator of Sh≈çka Sonjuku, it entered to phase two. The scale of the sonjuku increased apparently. Some seminars Sh≈çin held had the attendance above 200 per week. After Sh≈çin's death, it entered phase three.  Yoshida Sh≈çin  thumb Yoshida Sh≈çin (1830‚Äì1859), a teacher, scholar and patriot in Japan. He contributed to the Meiji Restoration through his own way, influenced the country by spreading knowledge. Yoshida Sh≈çin had a strong family background. He was in the Choushu Domain, which was influential during the Sengoku period. His background gave him the chances to touch the western sciences and technologies and became what he interested in when he was young. Before 1850s, Japan was isolated in peace for about 250 years. After the fleet of Matthew Perry arrived in Japan in 1853, the situation changed. The country was brought into chaos. Numerous shishis and scholars emerged and Yoshida Sh≈çin was one of the most important scholars in the late Edo period. His students, such as It≈ç Hirobumi, Takasugi Shinsaku, passed on his thoughs and spirits to Meiji Restoration and contributed to it. When Sh≈çin was young, he studied Yagama school and this experience influenced him significantly. The Yagama school was found by a vital Japanese scholar Yamaga Soto during the early years of the Edo period. The essential views of Yagama school were that people should pay more attention to Samurai class and the Bushido, the status of the country, and the emperor. In the 17th century, many scholars raised the question about Samurai: What role do they play in this peaceful age? As the answer of Yagama: devote themselves to their duty and giving loyalty to their owners. Yoshida Sh≈çin was influenced by these views and contacted to Buddhism as a part of the study. In 1856, Yoshida Sh≈çin was back to his academy, Sh≈çka Sonjuku and started his teaching at Sh≈çka Sonjuku. From the lecture notes of Yoshida Sh≈çin, Sh≈çka Sonjuku Ki, the essential purports were \\"Kun-Shin no gi, or the Duty of the lord and subjects, and Ka-I no Ben, or the discrimination of civilized and barbarian\\", combining with some views he was taught in Yamaga school. In 1859 November 21, Yoshida Sh≈çin was executed. Yoshida Sh≈çin was sent to prison due to plot the rebellion. In a ballad Yoshida composed: \\"This is the journey From which probably For me there shall be no return. Wholly drenched Is the pine tree of tears.\\"  Sh≈çin Jinja and Yoshida Sh≈çin  Sh≈çin Jinja is a holy place committed to the instructor Yoshida Sh≈çin (1830‚Äì1859) and based on the grounds were Sh≈çin educated, lived, and was detained for quite a while under house capture. Yoshida Sh≈çin was conceived in Hagi, a palace town situated in Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture. At the ready age of 11 years of age, he was instructing the daimyo Mori Takachika military expressions and scholastics. He turned out to be notable all through his space, just as others, as a brilliant personality and teacher at a youthful age. The fix of the Matsushita tuition-based school in a town was performed in August 1890, 31 years after the fact by the hands, for example, individuals from Matsushita non-public school in a town after I named the cherished god of the Shoin Shinto hallowed place, Yoshida quadrature individual (after Shoin educator) and was done junsetsu. The guardians' place of the Shoin educator, the little sanctuary of the godown style to revere the soul of a dead individual of Mr. Shoin by hand of the general population of the individual of cedar were raised at that point. This is the harbinger of the Shoin Shinto place of worship. His desire for information was vast to the point that he ineffectively endeavored to load up outside boats and depart Japan so as to examine western sciences and military strategies. This was a very risky journey since leaving your area, not to mention Japan, without consent was carefully prohibited. His celebrated endeavor to board one of the Black Ships under the order of American Commodore Matthew Perry brought about his capture. He was brought back to shogun Tokugawa Iemochi and tossed behind bars. At that time, the Sh≈çgun was attempting to arrange amicable exchange terms with the western powers that had landed on Japanese shores. Sh≈çin and his supporters demonstrated to be inconvenient for the shogunate as they were defenders of \\"Sonno Joi\\" (Revere the Emperor and Expel the Barbarians) contrary to the shogunate, or bakufu. As a result of his extraordinary conflict with the shogun's counsel Ii Naosuke, Shoin plotted an assassination on the counselor's life. It fizzled, and the contention between bakufu arrangement and the renegade revitalizing cry lead to the Ansei Purge (1858‚Äì1860) which at last brought about the sad passing of Yoshida Sh≈çin. On November 21, 1859, he was decapitated for his wrongdoings of plotting to kill Ii Naosuke and sorting out rebellions all through Japan. The grounds are home to Sh≈çin Jinja, an exhibition hall, Sh≈çka Sonjuku (the school where he showed a large number of Japan's future legends), and the house he went through quite a long while under house capture in. It is astounding to observe the minor school wherein Sh≈çin showed a significant number of the most brilliant personalities to rise up out of Choshu. While the curios on the grounds are a lot more established, the place of worship was finished in 1955. Since its fruition, numerous understudies have come to Sh≈çin Jinja to appeal to God for decent evaluations and fortune with upcoming tests. A portion of the samurai understudies who went to his lessons at Sh≈çka Sonjuku were Takasugi Shinsaku, Ito Hirobumi (Japan's first head administrator), Yamagata Aritomo, Kido Takayoshi, and Genzui Kusaka, all dynamic amid Japan's progress from the shogunate to the Meiji Restoration.  Famous students  It≈ç Hirobumi (1841‚Äì1909), the first Prime Minister of Japan, played an influential role of Meiji Restoration. He helped draft the Meiji constitution (1889) and brought about the establishment of a bicameral national Diet (1890). He was made a marquess in 1884 and a duke (or prince) in 1907. At the age of 68, he was assassinated in China. Yamagata Aritomo (1838‚Äì1922), twice Prime Minister of Japan, as known as the father of Japanese militarism. Japanese soldier and statesman who exerted a strong influence in Japan‚Äôs emergence as a formidable military power at the beginning of the 20th century. He was the first prime minister under the parliamentary regime, serving in 1889‚Äì91 and 1898‚Äì1900. Takasugi Shinsaku (1839‚Äì1867), a samurai who was pivotal to Meiji Restoration. He restructured the military forces of Ch≈çsh≈´ and enabled them to defeat the armies of Tokugawa Shogun. This war led to the Meiji Restoration and brought down the old government. The name list of the students registered in Sh≈çka Sonjuku can be found in the book Yoshida Shein (1830‚Äì1859) and the Sheka Sonjuku by Maida Stelmar Coaldrake M.A. (Tas.).

The 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis concerning who is the legitimate President of Venezuela has been underway since 10 January 2019, when the opposition-majority National Assembly declared that incumbent Nicol√°s Maduro's 2018 reelection was invalid and the body declared its president, Juan Guaid√≥, to be acting president of the nation. Guaid√≥ encouraged military personnel and security officials to withdraw support from Maduro, and offered an amnesty law, approved by the National Assembly, for military personnel and authorities who help to restore constitutional order. Maduro's government states that the crisis is a \\"coup d'√©tat led by the United States to topple him and control the country's oil reserves.\\" Guaid√≥ denies the coup allegations, saying peaceful volunteers back his movement. As of March 2019, Guaid√≥ has been recognized as the interim president of Venezuela by 54 countries, \\"including the US and most Latin American and European countries\\". Several top military figures recognized Guaid√≥, and hundreds of military personnel have defected to Colombia, but top military command has not broken ranks with Maduro as of mid-April 2019. Following the 23 January events, some Venezuelan diplomats in the United States supported Guaid√≥; the majority returned to Venezuela on Maduro's orders. Prior to 2019 presidential crisis Defections occurred before the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. = Ch√°vez presidency = In 2007, Defense Minister Ra√∫l Baduel publicly broke with Chavez and announced his opposition to the constitutional changes proposed in the 2007 constitutional referendum. Baduel became a \\"prominent voice of dissent\\", concerned that Ch√°vez was taking Venezuela down an authoritarian \\"road to ruin\\". He became the highest-ranking military person opposed to Chavez's constitutional changes that would \\"concentrate power in the executive\\". In October 2008, a military prosecutor claimed there had been financial irregularities, amounting to US$14 million, during Baduel's tenure as Defense Minister. The New York Times stated, \\"Ch√°vez has moved against a wide range of domestic critics, and his efforts in recent weeks to strengthen his grip on the armed forces have led to high-profile arrests and a wave of reassignments.\\" In 2009, Baduel was arrested; he said that his arrest was politically motivated, with Ch√°vez allies admitting same in private. He was imprisoned, and according to The Guardian, said \\"his crime was to realise‚Äîand declare‚Äîthat the president was a tyrant\\". The 2009 Human Rights Watch report mentions Baduel as an example of political persecution. In May 2010, Baduel was convicted by a military court of corruption and sentenced to seven years and eleven months in prison; Baduel says he is innocent. He was released in 2015. = Maduro presidency = In December 2014, security official Leamsy Salazar defected to the United States after communicating with the US Drug Enforcement Administration for about two months about Diosdado Cabello's alleged involvement with international drug trade. Salazar claimed that Cabello headed the Cartel of the Suns, a military drug trafficking organization in Venezuela; he fled to the US and was placed in witness protection. After Salazar defected, he said that the date that Hugo Ch√°vez died as stated by the Venezuelan government was wrong. Based on information from Salazar, ambassador to the Organization of American States, Guillermo Cochez, stated that Ch√°vez died on 30 December 2012, contrasting the 5 March 2013 date given by Maduro. The date of Ch√°vez's death is controversial since laws were passed in his name after the date Salazar stated he was to have died.  2017 constitutional crisis  On 12 January 2017, R√°ul Baduel was re-arrested on allegations that he was plotting to overthrow the government. Multiple other opposition politicians were detained in what opposition politicians called trumped up charges. In 2017, Attorney General Luisa Ortega D√≠az denounced the rupture of democracy in Venezuela when the Venezuelan Supreme Court, in a move both nationally and internationally considered a power grab, assumed powers constitutionally attributed to the National Assembly. The Supreme Court barred her from leaving the country and froze her assets, due to alleged \\"serious misconduct\\" in office, and she was dismissed as Prosecutor General by the newly established National Constitutional Assembly. Tarek William Saab, the replacement Chief Prosecutor appointed by the Constituent Assembly, claimed that she and her husband, German Ferrer, operated an extortion group and a day later, the Constituent Assembly ordered their arrest. Ferrer said the charges are political in nature. Ortega and Ferrer left Venezuela, with Ortega stating that the Maduro government would \\"deprive me of my life\\". Maduro has said he is seeking an international arrest warrant for both her and her husband, claiming they had been involved in serious crimes. On 28 November 2017 after differences with Venezuela's government, Rafael Ram√≠rez was fired as Venezuela's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York. In December, he confirmed that he had resigned from the UN post at the request of the Venezuelan president. Maduro aides presented no evidence of alleged graft during Ram√≠rez's tenure, and critics say the president was engaged in a \\"purge aimed at helping the embattled leader consolidate power over the country;s lifeblood oil industry\\", according to the Wall Street Journal. \\"Once among Venezuela's most powerful politicians\\", Ram√≠rez said he resigned on \\"pressure for expressing his opinions over how the country could overcome its crippling economic crisis\\". Along with Ortega D√≠az, Minister of Interior Affairs Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres become increasingly critical of the government in 2017. In June, he expressed his opposition to the presidential initiative to convene a National Constituent Assembly, and called instead for new elections. In 2018, Rodr√≠guez Torres, who had spoken the previous day at an opposition rally, was arrested by SEBIN agents; the Bolivarian government stated that the general had attempted to sow discord among the Venezuelan armed forces.  2019 presidential crisis  Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez declared the armed forces would not recognize Juan Guaid√≥ At the time of Maduro's second inauguration on 10 January 2019, The Washington Post reported that US intelligence had allegedly learned that Minister of Defense, Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez, had requested that Maduro step down, threatening to resign if Maduro did not. On 15 January 2019, Padrino L√≥pez swore loyalty to Maduro, stating that members of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela (FANB) \\"are willing to die to defend that Constitution, those people, those institutions and you as supreme magistrate, president of Venezuela\\". It was also reported that though the top military swore allegiance to Maduro, many secretly supported Guaid√≥ and had spoken to exiled and defected soldiers saying they would not suppress any uprising that could oust Maduro. Roc√≠o San Miguel, Executive Director of Control Ciudadano and a Venezuelan attorney and human rights activist who specializes in the military, told Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s that the Venezuelan National Guard had acknowledged 4,009 defections as of January 2019; she believed that because of the problem in the Armed Forces, Maduro had called for incorporating the people's militia as conscripts. The National Assembly offered an amnesty law for military defectors. On 11 January, plans to offer incentives for the armed forces to disavow Maduro were revealed. Venezuelan political experts, like David Smilde from the Washington Office on Latin America, suggested that this action would enrage Maduro, who already called the National Assembly \\"traitors\\" for not attending his inauguration, and who might arrest or attack more of its members. A friend of Guaid√≥, in response, said that they were aware of the risks but believed it needed to be done to allow democracy to reappear in Venezuela. During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, after the National Assembly declared Guaid√≥ acting president, the Miami Herald reported that the Maduro regime feared a military uprising and defections, had made many arrests, and Padrino L√≥pez ordered a counterintelligence effort to locate conspiracists or possible defectors. According to France 24, Maduro declared \\"military deserters who fled to Colombia have become mercenaries\\" as part of a US-backed coup. CBS News reported that rank-and-file troops, who made about US$6 per month, were \\"hungry and pushed to a tipping point\\". Guaid√≥ declared that the opposition had held secret meetings with military officials to discuss the Amnesty Law. An opposition representative stated that the meetings were focused on army officers, who were amenable to the idea and \\"expressed concern about the Trump administration's past threats of military intervention in Venezuela and [...] that the armed forces would be outgunned in any fight\\". Analysts warned that the meetings could potentially only win partial support and divide the military, which could lead to a civil war or coup. Maduro's government stated that the positions against him were the \\"result of imperialism perpetrated by the United States and allies\\" that put Venezuela \\"at the centre of a world war\\". =Defectors= Guaid√≥ encouraged military personnel and security officials to withdraw support from Maduro. One soldier who fled to Colombia during the 2019 shipping of humanitarian aid to Venezuela said that the majority of rank-and-file soldiers opposed Maduro, but top commanders have not broken rank with Maduro. Key officials Hugo Carvajal in 2016, sanctioned by the U.S. in 2008 Signs of impending crisis showed when a Supreme Tribunal Justice and Electoral Justice seen as close to Maduro defected to the United States just a few days before the 10 January 2019 second inauguration of Nicol√°s Maduro. The justice, , said that Nicol√°s Maduro was \\"incompetent\\" and \\"illegitimate\\". * According to The New York Times, he \\"called the May presidential election unfair and described Maduro's rule as 'a dictatorship.' He also accused Maduro of frequently taking direct orders from Cuban officials.\\" Hugo Carvajal, the head of Venezuela's military intelligence for ten years during Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency and \\"one of the government's most prominent figures\\", Also available online. publicly broke with Maduro in mid-February and endorsed Guaid√≥ as acting president. Also available online. Serving as a National Assembly deputy for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, The Wall Street Journal said the retired general is considered a pro-Maduro legislator. In a video released online on 21 February, he called for Venezuelan military forces to break ranks and to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to Venezuela. Directed to soldiers he said, \\"we do not have the technical capacity to confront any enemy ... he who says otherwise lies.\\" Directed to Maduro, he said, \\"You have killed hundreds of young people in the streets for trying to claim the rights you stole. This without even counting the dead for lack of medicines and security.\\" In an interview with The New York Times, Carvajal said Maduro was a \\"dictator with a corrupt inner circle that has engaged in drug trafficking and courted the militant group Hezbollah\\". US investigators accused Carvajal as being one of those responsible for drug trafficking in Venezuela; he said Maduro himself helped corrupt top government figures manage drug trafficking in Venezuela. Carvajal also questioned the status of Venezuela's sovereignty, alleging that Cubans control the Maduro government. In March 2019, he said that Maduro orders the \\"spontaneous protests\\" in his favor abroad, and his partners finance them. Maduro expelled Carvajal from the Armed Forces on 4 April, degraded his Major General status, and accused him of treason. Carvajal was arrested in Spain on 12 April 2019 based on an arrest warrant from the United States for 2011 drug trafficking charges; the U.S. asked Spain to extradite Carvajal.Castellanos, Silvio and Miguel Gutierrez, Andy Sullivan (12 April 2019). \\"Ex-Venezuelan intelligence chief arrested on U.S. drug trafficking warrant\\". Reuters. Retrieved 12 April 2019. Manuel Cristopher Figuera, the Director General of Venezuela's National Intelligence Service, SEBIN, broke with Maduro during the 2019 Venezuela uprising, saying it was time to \\"rebuild the country\\", and that scoundrels were plundering the country. Maduro announced he would reinstate Gustavo Gonz√°lez L√≥pez as the SEBIN head. Military high command  The Venezuelan Air Force's head of strategic planning, divisional general Francisco Esteban Y√°nez Rodr√≠guez, recognized Guaid√≥ as interim president on 2 February 2019, stating: \\"Today, with patriotic and democratic pride, I inform you that I do not recognize the irritating and dictatorial authority of Mr. Nicol√°s Maduro and I recognize Deputy Juan Guaid√≥ as the Interim President of Venezuela, for which I worthily place myself at your service\\". He stated that 90% of the armed forces would back Guaid√≥ if needed. Air Force general V√≠ctor Romero Mel√©ndez supported Guaid√≥ and called upon the Armed Forces to \\"support the people and the constitution\\". Retired air force major general Jorge Oropeza recognized Guaid√≥ as interim president. Major General Alexis L√≥pez Ram√≠rez, who resigned his command of Venezuela's National Defense Council in 2017, recognized Guaid√≥ as president on 23 February 2019. L√≥pez Ram√≠rez demanded respect for Venezuela's constitution, criticized the presence of Cubans in Venezuela's military, and said that command of the armed forces had been usurped by police and politicians from the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. On 18 March, Army general Carlos Rotondaro, who had been under sanctions by the United States since 2018, defected to Colombia and recognized Guaid√≥ as Venezuela's president. Rotondaro is a former Health Minister and former president of Venezuelan Social Security ( ‚Äì IVSS); in an 18 March interview with NTN24, he fingered ex-Minister of Health Luis L√≥pez as the person who had medicines withheld from patients, referring to a The New York Times interview of Cuban medical professionals published on the same day. On 4 April 2019, Maduro expelled him from the Armed Forces and degraded his rank. Other military Venezuelan National Guardsmen defecting into Colombia In early 2019, a group of Venezuelan ex-army and police officers in Peru announced support for Guaid√≥, disclaiming Maduro. Multiple groups of similarly retired or displaced soldiers said that they would return to fight Maduro if needed. Early on 21 January, at least 27 soldiers of the Venezuelan National Guard stationed near Miraflores Palace mutinied against Maduro. The Guardian reported that they kidnapped four security staff and stole weaponry from a post in Petare, and posted videos on social media promising the military would fight against the government. Rioting and arson took place in the area and tear gas was used on civilian protestors. After overnight fighting, the soldiers were taken by authorities. Five were injured and one person died in the mutiny: a civilian woman who was confused for a protester was killed by members of a colectivo. The BBC compared the mutiny to the El Junquito raid a year earlier, which resulted in the death of rebel leader √ìscar P√©rez. On 17 February, five military personnel and snipers were arrested by the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence in Ure√±a, T√°chira state, after publishing a video in which they declared support for Guaid√≥. During the February 2019 attempt to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela via the Brazilian and Colombian borders, hundreds of lower level troops fled across the border to seek refuge in Colombia. As of 5 April 2019, since the border clashes on 23 February began, 1,285 Venezuelan military personnel and police have broken ranks. During the 30 April 2019 Venezuela uprising, Maduro expelled from the military 54 members, in addition to Cristopher Figuera, who backed Guaid√≥, among them, \\"five lieutenant coronels, four majors, four captains, six first lieutenants and 35 sergeants\\"; 25 military personnel sought asylum in the Brazilian embassy in Caracas. According to Voice of America, experts in the United States believe that \\"there is still a long way to go\\" for Guaid√≥ to find support among the armed forces, stating that the Atlantic Council described the defection of National Guardsmen as \\"significant, but insufficient\\".  Diplomatic and political  Following the 23 January events, some Venezuelan diplomats in the United States supported Guaid√≥; the majority returned to Venezuela on Maduro's orders. Venezuela's ambassador in Iraq, Jonathan Velasco, recognized Guaid√≥, indicating that the National Assembly is the only government branch \\"associated with ethics, legitimacy and legality\\" and responsible for filling the \\"power vacuum created by the violation of the constitution\\". The Consul general of Venezuela in Houston recognized Guaid√≥, saying \\"I am at your service and at your disposal to serve my country.\\" Although consular officers destroyed thousands of documents from the ambassador's office and both the administration and consular section, nine officials decided to stay. The top Venezuelan consular officer in Miami supported Guaid√≥, stating \\"it [follows] my democratic principles and values\\" and urging other diplomats to \\"embrace the Constitution\\" and join Guaid√≥ in trying to force new elections. Two consular officials in Chicago recognized Guaid√≥, saying they wanted to be \\"associated with democratic principles and values\\". Colonel Jos√© Luis Silva, the Venezuelan military attach√© to the United States, recognized Guaid√≥ as his president.Venezuelan Colonel appointed by Maduro announces allegiance to Guaid√≥, Miami Herald (January 26, 2019).

He worked as a teacher from 1928 until 1931 when he was sent to the missions in Brazil. He would remain there for the rest of his life and would go travelling often to northern Brazilian cities where he would celebrate Mass and evangelize while hearing confessions on a frequent basis. Towards the end of his life he was hospitalized on nineteen separate occasions due to a series of health issues he began facing. He suffered from a spinal deformation that left him stooped and suffered from speech and breathing difficulties. His health declined into his nineties and he died from a stroke while recovering in hospital for breathing difficulties. The beatification process for the late friar had been called for after he died since the people in Recife and the northern cities revered Giannotti as a saint. The Olinda e Recife archdiocese launched the beatification cause in mid-2003 after its formal introduction in 2002 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause culminated on 6 April 2019 after Pope Francis acknowledged his heroic virtue and named him as Venerable. Life The memorial in his honor in Guarabira that was inaugurated in 2004. Pio Giannotti was born in Bozzano on 5 November 1898 as the second of five children born to the pious peasants Felice and Maria. His older brother Guglielmo became a priest and spiritual director while his sister Pia joined the Sisters of Saint Zita as a professed religious. He was baptized on 6 November in the Chiesa di Santi Caterina e Prospero and he later received his Confirmation on 15 June 1908 from Cardinal Benedetto Lorenzelli in the Lucca Cathedral. His First Communion when he was ten had a profound effect on him and upon returning home he had disappeared before he was found in the attic in silence before the Crucifix. It was from this point onwards that he felt a profound call to the religious life and so in 1911 when he was twelve he joined the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin at their convent in Camigliano where he began his initial ecclesial education; he made a formal request to join the order in May 1914. He was vested in the religious habit on 11 July 1914 in the Villa Basilica convent in Lucca and made his initial vows on 11 July 1915 upon the conclusion of his novitiate period. He did his philosophical studies which were interrupted during World War I when he was conscripted. It was after that he was discharged that he was sent to continue his education at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he did his dogmatics and canon law studies. On 29 September 1921 he received permission to go to the International College of San Lorenzo da Brindisi in Rome where he would live while finishing his education in Rome at the Gregorian. Giannotti made his solemn profession into the order on 30 October 1921 and the religious name he assumed was \\"Damiano da Bozzano\\". He received his ordination to the priesthood in the Chiesa di San Lorenzo da Brindisi on 25 August 1923 from Cardinal Basilio Pompili. Giannotti served as a vice-novice master in the Villa Basilica convent from 10 July 1925 until the Provincial Chapter of 1928 was held when he was appointed to teach seminarians in Massa. In 1930 the superior of the Brazilian missions Father Felice da Olivola asked for new missionaries for the northern region. In 1931 he was sent to the missions in Brazil at Pernambuco and would remain in Brazil until his death just over six decades later. He left with Fathers Ignazio da Carrara and Benedetto da Terrinca and set sail from Genoa on 28 May 1931 before arriving at the port of Recife on 17 June; upon arrival he settled in the Nossa Senhora da Penha convent in Recife's center. He lived in Macei√≥ in Alagoas during World War II until 1945. Giannotti studied Portuguese in order to be able to celebrate Mass and communicate with the people and travelled to places such as Rio Grande do Norte and Para√≠ba amongst others. It was while he travelled that he preached about the realities of Heaven and Hell and spoke also about sin and forgiveness. He was on the move often and ministered to all people from all walks of live and his mission of evangelization reached the northern areas of Brazil. Giannotti devoted himself to hearing confessions wherever he travelled after celebrating Mass and made preaching and evangelization the focus of his mission. He also delivered food and other provisions to the poor and to the sick. Giannotti was also a doctrinal conservative who was sometimes at odds with left-wing priests who supported liberation theology. His health began to fail as he aged but his health took a sharp decline into his nineties. It became more and more common during that time for people to see him for guidance rather than having him go out to see them. He suffered from a spinal deformation that left him bent and stooped to the point that it often caused speech and breathing difficulties. He also began suffering from erysipelas due to poor blood circulation and in 1990 suffered from a pulmonary embolism that slowed his walking. He was hospitalized on nineteen separate occasions as he grew older due to a series of health complications. Giannotti died on 31 May 1997 from a stroke after having been comatose for nineteen days in the Royal Portuguese Hospital in Recife. He was admitted to hospital on 6 May 1997 for severe respiratory failure and was comatose before spending four days in the recovery ward. The President Fernando Henrique Cardoso proclaimed a three-day period of mourning for Giannotti's death. His remains were embalmed and lay in state for three days in the Basilica Nossa Senhora de Penha. The Archbishop of Olinda e Recife Jos√© Cardoso Sobrinho presided over his funeral Mass was conducted in the Est√°dio do Arruda in Recife with twelve bishops and 138 priests present for the funeral; his coffin had to be helicoptered to the burial site since the people clogged the streets which made ground travel impossible. His remains were interred in the Nostra Signora delle Grazie chapel in Pina near Recife. Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns praised Giannotti after the friar's death and called him one of the greatest missionaries in Brazilian history; the cardinal said that he had delivered \\"firm teaching\\" that exhorted others to observe \\"good moral conduct\\". In 2004 came the inauguration of a memorial erected in his honor in Guarabira in Para√≠ba that had been in construction since 2000. Beatification process Statue in Araripe in Cear√°. The beatification process opened on 6 July 2002 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) edict and titled him as a Servant of God; the issuing of the edict was a declaration that no obstacles existed that would otherwise impede the cause's activation. The Olinda e Recife archdiocese launched the official diocesan investigation into Giannotti's life and reputation for holiness on 31 May 2003 and closed it a decade later on 24 May 2012; a smaller investigation was opened in the Lucca archdiocese in 2006 for additional evidence to be collected. The C.C.S. received the boxes of documentation collected during that timeframe and validated the diocesan process on 25 October 2013 as having complied with the congregation's official regulations for conducting diocesan investigations. The postulation (the officials in charge of the cause) submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in Rome on 15 September 2015 for assessment and it was a dossier that drew upon the documents and interrogatories collected during the diocesan investigation. It also was meant to present the case for Giannotti's holiness and the manner in which this was perceived during his life. Theologians issued a unanimous agreement to the cause on 6 February 2018 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 26 March 2019. Giannotti became titled as Venerable on 6 April 2019 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that the late friar had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life to an adequate degree. The current postulator for this cause is the Capuchin friar Fra Carlo Calloni.

In modern times, children dress as witches and knock at neighbours' doors while carrying salix tree branches (pussy willow), often decorated with colourful feathers. If accepted, they pronounce a blessing rhyme and leave a branch as gift, while receiving sweets in return. The Swedish-speaking minority, especially in Ostrobothnia, may instead celebrate the Saturday before Easter.  History  The tradition has various pagan and Christian origins: Nordic spring traditions to dispel bad spirits and wish a good harvest season, as well as the Christian ritual of the palms. In Finland, the Orthodox tradition involves children giving blessing with branches distributed at church celebration; the variant with costumes spread from the East as the Karelian evacuees from the evacuation of Finnish Karelia spread in the rest of Finland. A common rhyme is \\"Virvon varvon tuoreeks, terveeks, tulevaks vuodeks, vitsa sulle, palkka mulle!\\" which translates as \\"I'm wishing you a fresh, healthy upcoming year, a branch for you, a prize for me!\\" The chant has been translated in Juha Vuorinen's novel Totally Smashed! as \\"Willow switch, I'm the Easter witch! I wish you health and a love that's rich! From me I bring some luck today, for this branch what will you pay?\\" However, many alternatives are known. In the 21st century, the tradition has mixed with further examples of anglo-saxon trick-or-treating and various costumes.

Its route takes it through 3 states: from Thuringia via Hesse to Bavaria.  Route  = Bad Salzungen < 0 km ‚Äì 180 km > = The Rh√∂n Cycleway begins on the station forecourt next to the tourist information office on Gradierwerk street. From there it crosses to the other side of the Werra river and initially coincides with the Werra Valley Cycleway running downstream. It passes through Tiefenort to reach the picturesque timber-framed village of Kieselbach. In Merkers it crosses to the other side of the river and reaches Dorndorf, where potash salt used to be mined and where the River Werra is joined by the little Rh√∂n stream, the Felda, whose source is in the High Rh√∂n. The cycle path later crosses the Werra and follows its winding course to the historic bridge at Vacha. = Vacha < 22 km ‚Äì 158 km > = Bridge of Unity at Vacha Old station of Pferdsdorf/Rh√∂n on the cycleway in Thuringia A spur over the historic Werra Bridge leads to Vacha, the oldest town in West Thuringia. It owes its existence to its location on the ancient trade route between the Rhineland and the central German region, the Frankfurt-Leipzig Trade Route (Frankfurt- Leipziger Handelsstra√üe), which was also called the Imperial Road (Die Reiches Stra√üe or Via Regia). Here the route has to cross the Werra. There are many attractive timber framed buildings‚Äì the oldest dating to the 15th century ‚Äì which characterise the appearance of the town of Vacha. Back on the right bank of the Werra, the path continues to Philippsthal. = Philippsthal < 24 km ‚Äì 156 km > = In Philippsthal the route leaves the Werra valley and, for the next 50 kilometres, follows the Ulster valley of the High Rh√∂n. Along the Ulster it crosses the Thuringia-Hessian state border several times. This region was out of bounds to tourists until 1989. Tip: In Wenigentaft, cyclists can follow Waldhessen Route 14 to access (after 2 km) the 25-kilometre-long cycling route known as the Hessian Skittles (Hessisches Kegelspiel). = Geisa < 43 km ‚Äì 137 km > = Historic market place in Geisa A well upgraded section of cycleway leads to the town of Geisa at the foot of the Gangolfiberg. Geisa came into the possession of Fulda Abbey in 817 and, in 1265, was protected by a town wall, parts of which have survived. The market place forms the picturesque centre of the place. Tip: from Buttlar you can reach a closed railway line that is now a cycle path. It climbs gently up into the surrounding chain of hills and takes cyclists via Oechsen to Dermbach and the Felda Valley Cycleway. In Geisa a cycle part branches off to the Second World War memorial site of Point Alpha. On the trackbed of the old railway line through the Ulster valley the route reaches the historic little town of Tann. = Tann < 53 km ‚Äì 127 km > = Cycle path at Tann/Rh√∂n, signage The fate of Tann has for centuries always been associated with the border. Formerly it lay on the boundary between the territories of the bishops of W√ºrzburg, the abbots of Fulda, the Hessian landgraves, the counts of Henneberg and their successors, the dukes of Saxony. So Tann initially belonged to Fulda before becoming an imperial estate; it became Bavarian in 1806, then Prussia and, in 1945, Hessian. Until German Unity Tann was a border community in the GDR. Lying beside a farm track beside the banks of the Ulster and a narrow road that links sleepy little Ulster villages, the route makes its way to Hilders. A few hundred metres beyond the hamlet of Aura. the Milseburg Cycleway branches off. = Hilders < 64 km ‚Äì 116 km > = For experienced cyclists Hilders is integrated into the mountainbike route network of the Rh√∂n. In Hilders the High Rh√∂n Cycleway branches off as a variant of the Rh√∂n Cycleway. The Rh√∂n Cycleway itself remains in the valley and passes through the holiday villages of Thaiden, Seiferts and Melperts (OT of Ehrenberg) to the climatic spa of W√ºstensachsen in the upper Ulster valley. = W√ºstensachsen < 73 km ‚Äì 107 km > = Heidelstein The most important nature reserves of the Rh√∂n and the core zones of the Rh√∂n Biosphere Reserve lie around W√ºstensachsen and may easily be reached on the Rh√∂n Cycleway or over the well constructed mountainbike route network. In W√ºstensachsen the Rh√∂n Cycleway begins to climb up to the Long Rh√∂n to a height of a good 800 metres. The gradient averages 5% and runs through lush meadows and beech forest to the Schornhecke car park where it meets the High Rh√∂n Panorama Road (just below the Heidelstein). = Hochrh√∂n < 81 km ‚Äì 99 km > = Just under 2 kilometres after the Schornhecke car park the High Rh√∂n and Rh√∂n cycleways meet again before rolling through the High Rh√∂n countryside past the Thuringian Hut, a former customs house (managed), and the Rh√∂n Club hut of Schweinfurter Haus (managed, overnight accommodation), descending into the valleys of the Franconian Rh√∂n. Through the timber-framed village of Urspringen, where the Bahra rises as a ready-made stream from the church, the route arrives at Oberelsbach. Tip: In Urspringen the Rh√∂n-Sinn Valley Cycleway branches off leading to Fladungen. At its far end, in Mellrichstadt, is the possibility of catching the train back to Bad Salzungen. = Oberelsbach < 92 km ‚Äì 88 km > = The village lies in the middle of the Rh√∂n, surrounded by its outlying hamlets. Tip: In Oberelsbach the Els Valley Cycleway branches off towards Bad Neustadt. The main route now runs on the level along the eastern slopes of the High Rh√∂n. From the Bischofsheim village of Unterwei√üenbrunn it is an easy ride along the old railway bed to Bischofsheim. = Bischofsheim < 104 km ‚Äì 76 km > = Golgotha crosses near Kreuzberg Abbey by Bischofsheim At the foot of the Kreuzberg lies the state-recognised spa of Bischofsheim. The symbol of the town, the late Romanesque tower dating to the 13th century, the historic revenue office and the mostly well preserved town wall give Bischofsheim a medieval air. The continuation of the Rh√∂n Cycleway runs initially to Unterwei√üenbrunn again on the same path and then carries on through the Brend valley to Bad Neustadt in the valley of the Franconian Saale. = Bad Neustadt < 123 km ‚Äì 67 km > = Bad Neustadt is like a turnstile for cyclists. From here cycle paths run to Meiningen, to the River Main to Schweinfurt and W√ºrzburg, to Fulda, to the source of the Franconian Saale and of course to Bad Salzungen. From the Cyclist Information Point (Radler-Info-Punkt) the route runs initially through the Kurpark and the Kurviertel quarter of Bad Neustadt, then through the village of Salz, in which the lost palace of Charlemagne is purported to be. = Niederlauer < 129 km ‚Äì 51 km > = Tipp: In Niederlauer zweigt der Radfernweg Main-Werra ab, der nach Schweinfurt zum Main-Radweg bzw. weiter nach W√ºrzburg f√ºhrt. = Bad Kissingen < 155 km ‚Äì 25 km > = Bad Kissingen At the end of the Kurpark in Bad Kissingen the route crosses the Saale Bridge to the left bank. As far as Markt Euerdorf the route continues near the Franconian Saale.

It is recorded as early as 716 as hamulo castellum. Its claim to be the birthplace of Franconian wine is based on a document - the oldest original one in Bavaria, held in the W√ºrzburg State Archives. This document confirms that on 7 January 777, Charlemagne, there were vineyards in Hammelburg. Since that time the life of the town has been closely linked to viticulture.

As a two-year-old in 2017 she won two minor races from two starts. On her first appearance of 2018 she recorded her biggest victory when she won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. She was unplaced in two subsequent starts that year. Background Teppal is a bay filly with a white star and snip bred in France by the German breeding company Gestut Zur Kuste Ag. As a yearling in August 2016 the filly was put up for auction at Deauville and sold for ‚Ç¨60,000 to Con Marnane, an Irish horseman who specialises in buying yearlings and training them up before selling them as two-year-olds. In May 2017 Marnane sent the filly back to Deauville for a \\"breeze-up\\" sale (in which the horses are publicly galloped before being auctioned) and was bought for ‚Ç¨105,000 by Blandford Bloodstock. The filly entered the ownership of David Simcock who trained her at his Newmarket stable. Her sire, Camacho, was a sprinter who recorded his biggest win in the Sandy Lane Stakes. As a breeding stallion the best of his other offspring have been Signora Cabello (Prix Robert Papin) and My Catch (Prix de Cabourg). Teppal's dam Jummana showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race in France in 2002. She was descended in the female line from Kalila, who was a half-sister to both Val de Loir and Valoris. Teppal is a name for a spice related to sichuan pepper. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= In both of her races as a two-year-old Teppal was ridden by Jamie Spencer. She made her racecourse debut when she started at odds of 11/4 for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Lingfield Park on 30 August and won \\"cleverly\\" by a neck from Awesometank after taking the lead in the closing stages. On 25 September the filly started the 11/10 favourite for a minor race over the same distance on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse. After tracking the leaders she went to the front approaching the final furlong and drew away from her twelve opponents to win by four lengths. =2018: three-year-old season= Olivier Peslier rode Teppal on all three of her races in 2018. Before the start of the season she was bought privately for \\"big money\\" by the Qatari Sheikh Mohammed Bin Khalifa Al Thani. For her first run of the year the filly was sent to France to contest the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 13 May and started at odds of 12/1 in a fourteen- runner field. The Prix de la Grotte winner Musis Amica started favourite while the other fancied runners included Polydream (Prix du Calvados), Barkaa (Prix Vanteaux), Zonza (Prix du Bois), Coeur de Beaute (Prix Imprudence) and Wind Chimes (Prix Herod). The race was scheduled to took place on Longchamp's middle track, but after protests from some jockeys and trainers about the state of the racing surface the event was moved to the outer track. Teppal started well and settled in third place behind Could It Be Love and Sea Prose. As the field turned into the straight she appeared to be trapped on the inside rail but Peslier switched her to the outside to deliver a strong late run. Teppal gained the advantage in the closing stages and prevailed by a short neck and a head from Coeur de Beaute and Wind Chimes in a bunched finish which saw twelve of the beaten horses finish within four lengths of the winner. After the race David Simcock said \\"I'm made up. It's just nice to get a horse good enough to compete in a race like this and so to train a first Classic winner is fantastic. We were hopeful beforehand as she's very streetwise and she was in good shape. We weren‚Äôt overly fussed when the course was changed and Olivier Peslier gave her a great ride\\". On her return to England Teppal started at odds of 7/1 for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 22 June. She never looked likely to maintain her unbeaten record and finished ninth of the twelve runners behind Alpha Centauri, beaten fourteen and a half lengths by the winner. Simcock described the performance as \\"seriously disappointing\\" but explained that she came back from the race a sick horse who was underweight and \\"visibly under the weather\\" for weeks afterwards. After a break of more than three months the filly returned on 7 October in the Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres at Longchamp in which she was matched against older horses for the first time.

History Khaldunia High School was founded by Hajra Ahmed and Farukh Pracha. Classes commenced in January 1997 beginning with Grades 6 through 9. In September, GCE Ordinary level was launched. In September 1999, primary and elementary classes were introduced followed by preschool classes termed Reception in 2002. The Advisory Committee included Pervez Hoodbhoy, M. A K. Chaudhry, Ibn Abdur Rehman and Vaqar Zaharia. The word Khaldunia is inspired from Ibn Khaldun, the naming being a brainchild of Eqbal Ahmad. In February 2012, the plan to construct a purpose built campus was approved by the Capital Development Authority (CDA). The land was brought by the school from the CDA on a relatively low cost.  Events and Facilities The lone campus is located in Plot # 2, St 94, G-11/3 in Islamabad, Pakistan. The school hosts convocations, Annual Sports Days, Arts and Crafts Fairs, and Field Trips. Two science laboratories, a computer laboratory and a library are present in the campus. Students can become members of a number of clubs and societies, as well as an elected student council. Twice weekly assemblies are conducted by different classes regularly in the morning before classes begin. Guest lecturers are invited to speak to students, among with include notable speakers such as Eqbal Ahmad, Pervez Hoodbhoy, Zia Mian, Abdul Hameed Nayyar, Tariq Rahman, and Zafar Abbas.  Criticism Khaldunia High School is classified as a high-cost private school. In December 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan passed an order that forced such schools to reduce any fees in excess of than Rs. 5,000 by 20 per cent. The order was passed on the insistence of protesting parents who stated that private schools were charging 'extortionary' fees, and subjecting them to arbitrary increases.

Created on 1 April 2010, the regional health agencies are governed by Title III of Book IV of the first part of the Public Health Code (code de la sant√© publique). Establishment These institutions, created under the law 2009-879 of July 21, 2009 entitled \\"Hospital, Patients, Health and Territory\\", are intended to ensure a unified management of health in the regions, better meet the needs of the population and increase the effectiveness of the system. In concrete terms, one of their roles is to modernize and rationalize the supply of care and to ensure the proper management of hospital and medical expenses. The agencies act within the framework of a Regional Health Project which can be the subject of local health contracts concluded by the agency, in particular with the local authorities and their groupings, concerning the promotion of health, prevention, care policies and medico-social support. They are financed by a State subsidy, contributions from the health insurers and the Caisse nationale de solidarit√© pour l'autonomie, as well as, possibly, their own resources and voluntary payments from local authorities or institutions. History They replace the former regional hospitalization agencies (agences r√©gionales de l'hospitalisation), created in 1996 which had the status of public interest groups (groupements d'int√©r√™t public), the regional directorates of health and social affairs, the departmental directorates of health and social affairs and the directorates of health and social development in Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Martinique. They also replace the regional unions of the health insurance funds (unions r√©gionales des caisses d'assurance maladie). Operation They are supervised by the ministers responsible for health, social security, the elderly and the disabled, administered by a Director General with a supervisory board. The Director General grants authorizations of health facilities and services and medico-social institutions and services. The supervisory board is chaired by the regional prefect and has 24 members: *Three representatives of the State; *Ten representatives of the health insurers, chosen by the representatives of the trade union organizations; *Four representatives of local authorities; *Three representatives of the users of the health, social and medico-social system; *four qualified personalities; The supervisory board approves the budget and the financial accounts. It issues an opinion on the regional strategic plan and the multi- year contract of objectives and means. Each agency has a regional health and autonomy conference that contributes to the development of health policy in the region and two public health policy coordination commissions, one for prevention, school health, occupational health and maternal and child health, the other for care and medico-social support. In each region, the agency implements public health policies in services responsible for health at work, school and university health and maternal and child health: *It monitors the health status of the region, monitors compliance with hygiene rules and participates in the prevention and education of patients. *It carries out health inspection missions on behalf of the state and may intervene in the event of a health emergency. *It evaluates the training of health professionals and helps them at the time of their installation. *It participates in the control of medical acts and the dispensing of health products. *It conducts regional health insurance programs , particularly in the area of risk management. *It authorizes the creation and activity of health facilities and health services. It also authorizes the creation of certain categories of social and medico-social establishments and services. *It participates in the control of these establishments, in particular to verify the respect of the rights of users. *It encourages the implementation of a cultural component in these institutions. *In the health-environment sector competence includes: water & food: quality of human drinking water, quality of bathing water, swimming pools and recreational fishing sites, protection of the water resource; indoor environment: in the habitat; indoor air quality, fight against unhealthy habitat; external environment: noise pollution, outdoor air quality, healthcare waste, impact on the health of human activities. The regional health agency located in the administrative center of the defense and security zone is known as the regional zone agency. It is responsible for assisting the zone prefect in the implementation of national security and especially health defense missions, and thus to prepare and apply, if necessary, the ORSEC plan.

Initially supporting the role of the ARS as local relays of health and social strategies of the State, and supporting the institutions in their governance choices, the Hospital Federation of France has complained about the bureaucratic drift which imposes on institutions choices sometimes guided solely by economic imperatives and profitability. Since 2010, the federation has requested that the role and prerogatives of the agencies be reviewed, and regularly underlines the difficult dialogues between the directorates of the institutions and the agencies. The intervention of Guy Collet gives a reflection of a generally very mixed assessment of the agencies: \\"The operation of ARS is marked by an excess of bureaucracy\\" [...] \\"Hospitals have the feeling of a constant intrusion into their management and management\\" [...] \\"they must leave professionals the choice of ways and means to achieve these goals.\\" References Health care in France Government agencies of France Medical and health organizations based in France ","title":"Regional Health Agency"},{"id":"60493109","text":"Mahmoud Moustafa Fathalla (born 16 May 1958) is an Egyptian wrestler.

It is specifically caused by the Plasmodium malariae species, one of the six species of the protozoan genus Plasmodium. Quartan fever is a form of malaria where an onset of fever occurs in an interval of three-four days, hence the name \\"quartan.\\" It is transmitted by bites of infected female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Symptoms include fevers which range from approximately 40‚Äì41¬∞C and occur periodically in 72 hour intervals. Although cases of Malaria have occurred throughout the world, quartan fever typically occurs in sub-tropic regions. Quartan fever is considered to be a less severe form of malaria fever can be cured by anti-malarial treatments and prevention methods can be taken in order to avoid infection.  Cause  The female Anopheles mosquito is a vector which transmits quartan fever to people. Mature mosquitoes carry uninucleate sporozoites in their salivary glands, these sporozoites enter a human's bloodstream when mosquitoes puncture human flesh during feeding. Sporozoites attack and inhabit liver parenchymal cells in order to develop. Once the uninucleate sporozoites have matured the sporozoites then develop into uninucleate merozoites. Uninucleated merozoites mature into an erythrocytic stage schizonts which contain merozoites. The schizonts then rupture to release these merozoites; leading to more infections in the red blood cells. Uninucleated merozoites can also mature into uninucleate gametocytes which can invade and infect other female Anopheles mosquitoes during feeding, thus spreading the disease onto a wider population of humans. Anopheles Mosquito feeding (video taken County Durham, UK.)  Diagnosis  Fevers in intervals of 72 hours distinguish quartan fever from other forms of malaria where fevers range in 48 hour intervals or fever spikes happen sporadically. Early indications of catching quartan fever include having irritated spots, welts, hives, burning skin, however this is dependent on individual's tolerance to mosquito bites and may not show up on some people. With anopheles malaria mosquitoes the welts are most likely to not appear unless there are severe allergic reactions. The prepatent period is the time interval for when parasites are detected on a thick blood film. For quartan fever, P. malariae has a prepatent period ranging from 16-59 days. Specifically in the case of quartan fever, the rupturing of liver stage schizonts releases merozoites. This stage of the P. malariae life cycle is known as the \\"ring stages\\" and are the first stages which can be detected in human blood for diagnosis.  Medical procedures that diagnose a patient with quartan fever  * Blood smears can be used to detect the parasites within red blood cells, thick blood smears are typically used initially to detect the parasites, then it is followed by thin blood smears which can detect the parasites as the morphology of erythrocytes is maintained through the process. *Peripheral blood films stained with Giemsa strain are a method of blood examination used to diagnose the presence of Plasmodium malariae, and detect quartan fever. * Rapid diagnostic tests can detect antigens which cause malaria, a sample of blood is collected from the patient and placed on a test card. After 15-20 minutes bands show up on the test card which indicate the specific species of malaria the patient is infected with. * Serological tests are used in general to detect whether a patient has developed antibodies to specific microorganism, therefore Serological tests are used to detect past encounters with Plasmodium virus rather than cases where a patient has newly come in contain/has been infected with P. malariae and has quartan fever. *Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) are used to diagnosis Plasmodium malariae (cause of quartan fever) as well to separate mixed infections.  Treatment  * Chloroquine is administered in the form of a tablet for ingestion. *Chloroquine is a water-soluble drug which is used to treat quartan fever. Chloroquine a suppressive drug which is ingested in a compressed tablet form and is mainly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. * Hydrochloroquine is also a suppressive, anit-malarial agent used to treat quartan fever. Hydrochloroquine is also typically administered to patients suffering from lupus flares. * Both hydrochloroquine and chloroquine have a side effect of retinal toxicity when administered to infected patients. * Adverse effects of the drug chloroquine include agitation, anxiety, confusion, Gastrointestinal discomfort, blurring vision, and/or irreversible retinal damage. * Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is administered to pregnant women during the gestation period. Two-three doses of SP has been proven to reduce the levels of placental malaria and had a reduced risk of moderate to severe anemia.  Prevention  Ways to minimise exposure to the Anopheles mosquito include: * Indoor residual sprays are one of the most utilised methods of malaria prevention by the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign. Spraying is a method in multiple regions and to control epidemics. *Nets treated with insecticide are effective in preventing mosquito contact for three years. The World Health Organisation (WHO) specifically targets younger children and pregnant women in order to reduce the risk of spreading Quartan fever within the population. *Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) administration to pregnant women is also a source of prevention in order to reduce the risks of maternal anaemia, low birth rate, and perinatal mortality. SP reduces the impact Quartan fever may have on newborns and decrease the morality rate. This method of prevention is known as \\"chemoprevention.\\" Anopheles mosquito larvae, taken by Steffen Dietzel * House improvement is also a method of prevention. Traditional houses consisting of natural materials are susceptible to gaps which allow entry to infected Anopheles mosquitoes. House improvements including windows, installation and sealed doors reduce the risk of coming in contact with the infected mosquitoes. * Larval source management is the control and monitoring of aquatic environments in order to prevent fully Anopheles mosquitoes from fully developing. Mosquitoes require aquatic environments in order to fully mature and develop. Once mosquito eggs hatch, the larva must live in the water and develop into pupa. The pupa stage then matures into a fully developed mosquito and emerges from its aquatic habitat. When removing any water-filled containers from the surrounding area the mosquito life cycle is halted and acts as a method to reduce mosquito population within the surrounding area. * Clothing can act as a physical barrier to prevent exposure of flesh for mosquitoes to feed on, treating beds and clothing with insecticides/repellents can further reduce chances of infected mosquitoes from biting and passing quartan fever to individuals. * Avoiding areas which have high mosquito populations, specifically for quartan fever the P. malariae strain. * Avoiding travelling to regions which have a sub-tropic climate to prevent infection and developing quartan fever. *Implementing the sugar baiting method aids in reducing the population of Anopheles mosquitoes, and ultimately reducing the likelihood of catching quartan fever. Both male and female mosquitoes feed on the Attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) and ingest low-risk oral toxins e.g. boric acid. This leads to mosquito death and reduces population.

It was first called Veraldar saga by Konr√°√∞ G√≠slason in his 1860 edition of the text. Veraldar saga follows the common medieval practice of dividing the world into six ages. However, it is unlike twelfth century European historiography for being written entirely in the vernacular, without any interpolated poetry, and for giving no attention to the area of the world where it was composed, instead focusing on the Holy Roman Empire. Cross notes that it instead has more in common with European works from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Summary  Veraldar saga is a history of the world from Creation to the twelfth century. In most versions, the saga switches to the present tense to when it reaches its final sentence which says that Frederick I Barbarossa is Holy Roman Emperor. This suggests that it was written sometime during Frederick's reign from 1155-1190. The six ages are as follows: > 1\\\\. Creation of the world to the construction of Noah's Ark. > 2\\\\. Noah entering the Ark to the life of Terah, Abraham's father. > 3\\\\. The life of Abraham to the reign of King Saul. > 4\\\\. The reign of King David to the life of Elisha, foster-son of Elijah. > 5\\\\. The Babylonian Captivity to the reign of Emperor Augustus. > 6\\\\. The birth of Christ to the reign of Emperor Frederick I, though the > sixth age was envisioned to last until Judgement Day. The text uses little direct speech and other than occasional alliteration, very few rhetorical devices are used. W√ºrth summarises the text as \\"a dry and linear report which confines itself to listing the events.\\"  Background  Historiography was common in medieval Iceland, and as W√ºrth notes, it can be difficult to separate historiography as an independent genre in Old Norse- Icelandic, as all Old Norse-Icelandic literature as a whole shows an interest in history. However, there is a class of texts known as pseudo-histories that overlaps in some respects with the content of Veraldar saga. These are loose translations and reworkings of Latin texts which deal with the history of peoples outside medieval Scandinavia. The five texts are Tr√≥jumanna saga, R√≥mverja saga, Breta s√∂gur, Alexanders saga, and Gy√∞inga saga. Veraldar saga differs from these texts in being a full universal history. W√ºrth notes that Veraldar saga sits on the border between translation and original vernacular composition. It is not a compilation of translations of Latin works, but a gathering of a number of different sources which may have been a mix of texts written Old Norse-Icelandic and Latin. While other universal histories were written in Iceland, they are considerably later than Veraldar saga. Reynista√∞arb√≥k (AM 764 4to) was written c. 1360-1380 and Heimsaldrar in the manuscript AM 194 8vo. dates to 1387. Heimsaldrar in AM 194 8vo. uses the same six ages as Veraldar saga whereas Reynista√∞arb√≥k organised them as follows: Adam - Noah - Moses - David - Christ. Benediktsson considers Heimsaldrar to be a variant of Veraldar saga rather than an independent work.  Manuscripts and versions  Veraldar saga is represented in eleven manuscripts and fragments, representing two main redactions, labelled A and B by Jakob Benediktsson. Version B exists in early fragments, but it survives in full only in copies from 1600 and later. Unlike A, this version of the text contains allegorical notes on each of the first five ages. Benediktsson considers these to be original features which were omitted from version A. Version A includes additional material including an account of the four synods in Nicea, Constantinople, Ephesus and Chalcedon; a section on the patriarchs; and an incomplete list of popes.  Sources and parallels  Veraldar saga shares with Bede and Isidore's work the six ages, but there is little direct link between the saga and these authors. There are however closer parallels with the Historia Scholastica. There are close parallels between sections of Veraldar saga and R√≥mverja saga. Hofmann proposed that Veraldar saga takes its Roman history from R√≥mverja saga.Hofmann, Dietrich. (1986) \\"Accessus ad Lucanum.

The name Zefiro derives from the acronym ZEro FIrst stage ROcket, conceived when this motor was intended to be used as first and second stages of San Marco program of the Italian Space Agency (ASI). After its intended use as booster was shelved the acronym was dropped and only the reference to the Greek god of the west wind Zephyrus remained. two models, Zefiro 23 and Zefiro 9A, are in use with Vega and another model, Zefiro 40, is in development for Vega-C.  History  The first engine completed was Zefiro 9, the third stage engine. The first test firing was carried out on 20 December 2005, at the Salto di Quirra Inter-force Test Range, on the Mediterranean coast in southeast Sardinia. The test was a complete success. After a critical design review based on the completed first test firings, the second test-firing of the Zefiro 9 took place at Salto di Quirra on 28 March 2007. After 35 seconds, there was a sudden drop in the motor's internal pressure, leading to an increased combustion time. On 23 October 2008, an enhanced version of the Zefiro 9 with a modified nozzle design and increased propellant load, the Zefiro 9A, was successfully tested. On 28 April 2009, the final qualification test firing of Zefiro 9A took place at the Salto di Quirra Interforce Test Range in Sardinia, Italy. The Zefiro 23 was test fired twice on 26 June 2006 and 27 March 2008 at Salto di Quirra. Both tests were successful and the motor qualified for use on Vega. Zefiro 40 first test occurred on 8 March 2018 also at Salto di Quirra with a successful 92 seconds burn. A failure of the Zefiro 23 occurred shortly after the planned ignition during the FalconEye 1 mission on 11 July 2019 which resulted in the loss of the satellite and a mission failure. The Zefiro 23 was supposed to fire for 77 seconds. Telemetry data showed the Vega rocket achieved a top speed of approximately 2.17 km/s, 233 seconds into flight. The rocket then deviated below its planned ascent trajectory before falling into the Atlantic Ocean north of the Centre Spatial Guyanais.  Overview  The propellant of all Zefiro models is HTPB 1912 with a nominal composition of 19% of aluminium powder, 69% of ammonium perchlorate with 12% of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene binder. Zefiro 23 and Zefiro 9A, where the number represent the intended propellant weight at design phase, are used respectively as second and third stage of Vega rockets. Both motors have a 1.9 m diameter carbon epoxy filament wound case, a low density EPDM insulation, a flexible rocket nozzle joint and an electromechanical thrust vector control system. Zefiro 23 is 7.5 meters tall and weighs 26 tonnes, of which 24 tonnes consist of solid propellant. It has a nominal burn time of 103 seconds with combustion chamber pressure of 95 bars. Zefiro 9A, designed and built exclusively with Avio technologies, is 3.5 metres tall, weighs 11.5 tonnes and burns 9 tonnes of solid propellant. It has a nominal burn time of 77 seconds with combustion chamber pressure of 95 bars, consumed in slightly more than 110 seconds. Zefiro 40, still in development phase as of 2020, is intended to be used as second stage of both Vega-C and Vega-E. In comparison to its predecessor Zefiro 23, the motor has an increased exercise pression, better structural load margins for both the casing and the propellant grains and an improved flexible rocket nozzle joint.

Xiaokai Yang created the super marginal analysis method and revived the important thought of division of labour of Adam Smith. The new classical economics reconstructs several independent economic theories with the core of neoclassical economics from the perspective of endogenous individual choice specialization level by means of inframarginal analysis, which is the frontier subject of economics development. The analysis method based on marginal utility and marginal productivity in modern mainstream economics textbooks is marginal analysis. However, Yang xiaokai believes that marginal analysis cannot solve the problem of division of labor, so he introduced the inframarginal analysis. In brief, inframarginal analysis is an analytical method that includes the types of products, the number of manufacturers and transaction costs into the analytical framework. The impression of inframarginal economics is that it provides potential support for marginal economics and inframarginalists argue that the division of labour and professionalization of the economy are crucial to economic progress. To prove this, they need to develop the empirical aspects of their field and inframarginalists seems to be obsessed with analysing solutions.  Important concept  = Corner solution = The corner solution is a very extreme and special case. It refers to the situation that when consumers do not consume or choose one commodity, but only choose to consume another commodity, their optimal choice is to point to the endpoint of the budget constraint line. When the corner solution appears, the marginal substitution rate of consumers is not equal to the price ratio of each consumption level in all cases. At this point, consumers can maximize their utility by consuming only one of two goods. In this case, the graph shows that the absolute value of the slope of the utility function is greater than the absolute value of the slope of the budget line. = New classical economics = New classical economics is a school of thought formed in the 1970s, which is refining the former neoclassical economics. Its theoretical framework consists of rational expectation hypothesis and natural unemployment hypothesis. The school argues that a market economy can automatically solve problems such as unemployment and recession, while government-led stabilization policies have no effect. Differ from monetarism, the dilemma between unemployment and inflation does not exist only in the long and short run. New classical economics is proposed by a group of economists which led by Australian Chinese economics Yang and they are using nonlinear model and the classical mathematical programming method, and gave up important new classical economics about the division of labor and specialization of economic thoughts, make decisions and equilibrium model, this caused a wave after wave of resurrection of using modern analytical tools of classical economics. Their research aims to scientifically find the micro theory of economic growth and establish the micro model based on the macro economic growth. They changed the neoclassical economics into \\"economics is the knowledge used in the study of the rational allocation of various economic scarce resources\\" into \\"economics is the dilemma of the study of economic activities in various conflicts\\", and its main task is to explore the interaction and evolution process between technology and economic organizations. The new classical model of organizing experiments is dynamic. The difference between this model and the static model is that people's information about division of labor will evolve spontaneously with the passage of time. The difference with previous dynamic models is that people's knowledge of the division of labor and organization increases gradually with the passage of time. In the analysis framework of new classical economics, the emergence and evolution of division of labor and specialized organizations, including government organizations, are endogenous phenomena. In the view of neoclassical economics and interventionism, various specialized organizations, including government organizations, are exogenous. The analysis of government functions from the perspective of division of labor makes us realize that the so-called \\"government failure\\" is a false proposition, just as \\"market failure\\" is a false proposition. From the perspective of the evolution of new classical economics, the emergence of government creates new professional and division of labor structures. Government exists when the cost of protecting people's interests through intermediaries is lower than the cost of protecting their own interests. As for the transaction costs of the new division of labor of \\"government\\", we should consider the dilemma conflict corresponding to government functions, that is, the government costs from the perspective of emerging classical economics. Combining the significance of division of labor produced by the government with the transaction costs borne by the division of labor, we can see a process of government from gestation, emergence to development. Put the government into the long river of historical development, the government is actually the product of social division of labor, and the government function is the result of specialization.  The steps of inframarginal analysis  The inframarginal analysis is divided into three steps: the first step is to use the optimal mode theorem to exclude those corner points that cannot be the optimal solution. The second step is to use the \\"marginal analysis\\" method to solve the remaining combinations (corner point solution) and obtain each local optimal value. The third step is to compare the local maximum objective function values of each combination, and the overall optimal solution is the general equilibrium optimal solution. Thus it can be seen that the ultra-marginal analysis method is not only derived from the marginal analysis, but also includes and surpasses it. Since the new classical economics assumes that people are both consumers and producers, according to the inframarginal analysis, they not only make a marginal choice among the various products they consume, but also make an inframarginal choice among the products they specialize in. In fact, their choices also involve how much to sell, whether to hire workers, and so on.  Current use  = Labour = On the analysis of the inframarginal analysis about the division of time on the latest literature survey, review this framework since 1970s put forward the development of the situation, and discusses the framework and classical ideas in work assignments and other contemporary research project after contact, found the inframarginal analysis for in all areas of workforce management has very important influence. Published at the same time, international trade, e-commerce, enterprise theory, property rights and contracts, urban economics, national economics, public economics, macroeconomics, and other fields of the latest research results, also shows it is widely used, and proves that the influence of inframarginal analysis to reduce labor cost and the marginal utility of analyzing labor is pretty good. = E-commerce = In the modern era of rapid development of network business, using ultra-marginal framework to analyze the development of e-commerce and related phenomena, such as bundling, is a very effective analysis method to improve sales performance and reduce marginal cost. In many cases, ultra- marginal network decision making is more important than marginal network decision making. By comparing the role of marginal analysis and ultra-marginal analysis in e-commerce, ultra-marginal analysis provides profound insights for network decision-making, e-commerce and bundled-management on the basis of traditional marginal analysis. The essence of ultra-marginal analysis is the tradeoff between the specialized economy brought by the division of labor network and the trade transaction cost required by the specialization. Which market networks and the associated division of Labour are effective depends on this trade-off. If the transaction efficiency is very low, the positive network effect of the specialized economy or market is to offset the transaction cost, so the self-sufficiency or low level of division of labor, which is with a small network market, is effective and will choose the invisible hand. If transaction efficiency is improved, the level of division of labor and the scale of relevant market network will increase.  Difference  = Marginal and inframarginal analysis = Marginal analysis is a method to study the change of micro increment in economic operation by means of derivative and differential method, and to analyse the relationship between economic variables and the change process. Marginal \\"extra\\", namely, the meaning of \\"additional\\" refers to is on the edge of the \\"has been one of the last unit in additional\\", or \\"the next unit may be imposed\\", belongs to the concept of derivative and differential, is refers to the function relations, tiny change of the independent variables, dependent variable in the marginal changes, the marginal value of two micro increment ratio.This analysis method is widely used in the analysis process of economic behaviours and economic variables, such as utility, cost, output, income, profit, consumption, savings, investment, factor efficiency and so on. Inframarginal analysis is to add a \\"super\\" on the basis of marginal analysis, and this \\"super\\" is another step. More specifically, it means that before people make the decision of resource allocation, they should first choose specialty and division of labor. The resulting \\"corner solution\\" and the \\"text theorem\\" used to simplify its analysis must be said to be a great innovation. The \\"corner solution\\" is generated when people choose the level of specialization. The corner solution is not considered in neoclassical economics, because its marginal analysis method can only be used to analyze the internal point solution, that is, the resource allocation problem when given the division of labor and the level of specialization. = Neoclassical and new classical economics = Neoclassical economics refers to the basic theoretical framework of microeconomics and macroeconomics formed after three major revolutionary changes, including the chamberlain revolution, the Keynesian revolution and the rational expectation revolution. This framework is called New classical economics to distinguish it from earlier classical economics. Concentration of new classical economics fully reflects the modern western mainstream economics over the past 100 years of research results and development characteristics, it pay more attention on the research methods of falsified generalization, the diversification of assumptions and analysis tools of economization in the fields of math, science, research, case using the classic, the marginalization of interdisciplinarity. The academic school is about the theory of distribution. On the basis of equilibrium price theory, Marshall established the theory of distribution according to the factors of production, and the prices of the factors of production also depend on their respective equilibrium prices. These factors of production belong to the owners of labor, land, capital and enterprise organizations. Xiaokai Yang and other economists adopted the inframarginal analysis method to construct the architecture of New Classical Economics on the basis of sublating Neoclassical Economics. Emerging classical economics from the perspective of labor division evolution, using nonlinear programming and other than the classical mathematical programming methods, will be the new classical economics in the abandoned Classical Economics economic thoughts about the division of labor and specialization, into decision making and equilibrium model, as to explain the root of all economic activity, breaking the traditional barriers between macro and micro economics. Neoclassical economics is \\"the study of the rational allocation of scarce resources among various economic USES\\", that is, the study of the allocation of resources under static conditions. However, the core problem of classical economics research represented by Adam Smith is how to overcome the limitation of resource scarcity and increase the supply of scarce resources, that is, how to change the division of labor and evolution of production probability curve. The evolution of division of labor and transaction costs are in conflict. According to this, the new classical economics holds that \\"economics is the study of all kinds of dilemmas and conflicts in economic activities\\", and discusses the dilemma and conflict of \\"division of labor and transaction costs\\", trying to solve the problem of the split between micro and macro economics. In addition, economics in the end of the 20th century, the American economist Stiglitz published a new textbook of economics in 1993 as the representative and mark, and began the fourth synthesis. Stiglitz's theoretical innovation lies in: first, the expression of macroeconomics is directly laid on the solid foundation of microeconomics, so as to surpass samuelson's economics. Second, to strengthen the information problem, incentive problem, moral problem, adverse selection problem and other new issues of research and achieve new results and new development; Third, further emphasis on the positive role of government intervention in the economy, relying on government regulation according to law, the market can effectively allocate resources. The analysis of bipolar world theory points out that neoclassical economics, like neoliberalism, belongs to the economic theories of the capitalist world system in the period of external expansion, which are generated under the general background of insufficient international effective demand. For western developed capitalist countries, the essence is to replace consumption welfare with employment welfare. For developing countries, consumption benefits replace employment benefits.

The DES helps measure mood based on Carroll Izard's differential emotions theory, The DES consists of thirty items, three for each of the ten fundamental emotions as visualized by Izard: interest, joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, shame/ shyness, and guilt, which are represented on 5-point Likert scale. There are currently four different versions of the scale. Despite the different versions, the basic idea of are very similar. Participants are asked to rate each of the emotions on a scale, and depending on the instructions given, they either rate their current feelings, feelings over the past week, or over long-term traits (i.e. how often do you feel this emotion in your day-to-day living). The DES is similar to other scales such as the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL) and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List-Revised (MAACL-R) which are used to assess either the state or trait affect by varying the time of which instructions are given to the participants.  Theory  The Differential Emotions Theory evaluates the intensity of primary emotions to gain understanding between basic emotions and associated constructs of facial expression. The theory defines emotion(s) as an intricate process within neuromuscular, phenomenological, and neurophysiological areas. Within the neuromuscular aspect, it is the facial activity and patterning and body response. In the phenomenological aspect, it is the motivational experience or experience that has instant significance towards the individual. As for the neuropsychological aspect, it is primarily the patterns of the electrochemical activity within the brain. The theory emphasises on the discrete emotions along with five assumptions (one: the fundamental emotions; two: the fundamental emotions each have distinctive motivational properties; three: these fundamental emotions lead to different experiences and behaviour; four: emotions interact and one emotion can trigger another; five: emotions influence and interact with other processes such as: homeostatic, drive, perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes). The first significant evidence that supports the DET is based on Ekman's (1971) neurocultural theory (recognition of facial expression and emotion). Data collected from this field of research led to Izard's development of the DET. Unlike Ekman's research and theory where it focuses on the explanation of universal and cultural differences in facial expression of emotion, Izard focuses on the functions of emotions and its role as a component in motivating human behaviour. = Development = The name Differential Emotions Scale came from the examination of verbal labels and facial expressions. Research have shown that participants of different backgrounds (i.e. ethnicity, culture, language) are all able to agree on and can differentiate different facial expressions among the fundamental emotions. Upon research done on American, English, French, and Greek subjects, where they were asked to verbally description of a series of fundamental emotion facial photographs of cross-cultural and standardised facial expressions. This provided background support and allowed for further development upon the DES by helping generate a set of words for the different emotions that could be understood across cultures.  DES-IV  The DES-IV is a version of the DES where it has 49 items. This version of mood-state inventory is a multidimensional instrument, and is used to look over and examine the frequency of multiple fundamental human emotions. The 49 items of the DES-IV help measure 12 basic emotions (interest, joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, hostility, fear, shame, shyness and guilt). It was also suggested by Boyle (1985) that DES-IV and the Eight State Questionnaire are one of the more promising self-report multivariate mood-state instruments.  Reliability and validity  The DES takes form of self-report, where individuals are asked to rank their emotions within the discrete categories of fundamental emotions. Due to the subjective-experience component of this system, this therefore leads to the many concerns and criticism as to whether or not this will hinder the reliability and validity of the results attained. DES is different from other multivariate measures of mood states as it is based on the principle that characteristic patterns of fundamental emotions are involved in the mood states such as anxiety and depressed feelings. Many studies have been carried out on large samples, these factor analyses have supported at least eight of the suggested fundamental emotions. However, findings from these studies also suggest that the construct validity of the DES sub-scales are not clear. Improvement in areas of sub-scales, internal consistency, and reliability of the instrument throughout retests will be needed to help improve overall reliability and validity. One of the largest setbacks of this scale is self-reporting factor. The transparency of items may lead to self-distortion and response bias (i.e. poor self-perception or faking responses). Many studies have exploited the DES and have been able to prove that emotions factors as highly stable. From these studies and analyses, it suggests that factors acquired are constant with the theoretically defined factors. The DES has been used in studies of anxiety and depression, patterns of emotion in love and jealousy, and relationship of subjective sexual arousal and emotion.  Analytic technique  = Computational analyses = Computational analysis is a strategy that consists of exploratory or bind factor analyses which is then also processed through confirmatory factor analyses. Results of an exploratory analysis may be able to provide a heuristic and suggestive value, which can then be helpful in the generation of hypotheses that are able to carry out more objective testing. Confirmatory factor analyses provides a direct test of a specific model, therefore making it the primary source in determining the validity of DES. The analysis also provides an estimate for the correlation between items within the group factors and correlation between group factors.  Criticism  Although Izard's theory and differential scale have been used in multiple studies, it has also been criticised to that it is too narrow and focuses too much on negative emotions rather than keeping a balance. Although the DES allows researchers to assess emotions in a continuous aspect, due to the exclusion and lack of consideration of low-energy states (i.e. fatigue and serenity), it can affect results gathered through different emotion studies. In fact, these low-energy states are said to have great relation to mood, and are also feelings that are commonly felt in our day-to-day life. Which therefore means that they have great relevance and should be considered in the process of studying about moods, feelings, and emotions. Another criticism upon Izard's Differential Emotions Scale was that it may be impossible to capture the little differences within everyday experiences without including many different states instead of using non-specific terms (i.e. upset, distressed) which are ambiguous and do not correspond to one single emotion. This applies to positive emotions as well as interest, joy, happiness and excitement are usually the terms used. Despite being able to show high intercorrelations, the scale of this instrument is only able to show low internal consistency. Due to the minimal number of items, it can also cause reliability problems upon results attained.  See also  * Caroll E.

Her works have been translated into Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, Estonian, German, Italian, Macedonian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish. She is noted for her rich language, her lyrical yet matter-of-fact tone, and her distinct style, which is often characterized by a female second-person narrator and sometimes by the syntactic use of long and short sentences to suggest the rhythm of events. Critics have identified her as one of the first Israeli women novelists to break into what had been, until the 1980s, a male-dominated field.  Career  Judith Katzir was born in 1963 in Haifa, a city whose landscapes and landmarks feature prominently in her writing. For example, her short story, \\"Disneyel\\", features the Carmel ridge, Balfour and Herzl Streets, and the blue waters of the Mediterranean sea along Haifa's coastline. Her parents were both lawyers and she is the eldest of three children. Katzir studied literature and cinema at Tel Aviv University, and began publishing her stories in Israeli journals in the 1980s. She published her first book, Sogrim et ha-Yam, a collection of four novellas, in 1990; this appeared in English as Closing the Sea in 1992. The book was a best-seller and one of the stories in the volume, \\"Schlaffstunde\\" (\\"Sleeping Hours\\"), appeared in The Oxford Book of Hebrew Short Stories in 1996. \\"Schlaffstunde\\" has also been adapted into a one-person theater play, as well as a film entitled Family Secrets. Katzir's first novel was Le-Matisse Yesh et ha-Shemesh be-Beten (\\"Matisse Has the Sun in His Belly\\"). Katzir's most recent novel, Tzilla, appeared in 2013. Katzir has published one play, Dvora Baron (2000), about the first Hebrew woman author. The play was performed in 2000 by the Cameri Theatre in the Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center. Katzir has taught creative writing and worked as an editor at Hakibbutz Hameuchad/Siman Kriah Publishing House.  Literary themes and influences  Many of Katzir's novels and stories explore themes of female agency, often from the perspective of female adolescence. Some, such as the story \\"Schlaffstunde\\" and the novel Hineh Ani Mathillah (\\"Here I Begin\\") (2003; published in English as Dearest Anne in 2008), also evoke the Holocaust as it shapes the consciousness of her protagonists. Katzir noted in an interview that, growing up in Haifa in the 1960s and 1970s, Israeli schools did not teach children about the Holocaust. Nevertheless, she said that the event \\"was like a nuclear cloud above us, above our heads\\". Other works, like her novel Tzilla (2013), draw on elements of her family's history. Katzir has acknowledged basing the eponymous character of Tzilla on her great- grandmother, Tzilla Margolin, who was born near Minsk (now in Belarus) in 1883, lost an eye in a pogrom, and later immigrated to Palestine. The novel Tzilla focuses on the story of one woman and, in the process, offers a distinctly female perspective on Jewish settlement in Palestine. Married with five children, the real-life Tzilla met a man named Hanan who became her lover and soulmate. Hanan moved in with her family and lived with them for 25 years until the death of Tzilla's husband, whereupon Hanan and Tzilla were married.  Social activism  Katzir noted in an interview that she used to be active in the Geneva Initiative, which involved Israelis and Palestinians negotiating for a future peace deal. Katzir has reported that her great-grandparents (Tzilla and Eliezer Margolin) lived in Gaza from 1919 to 1925, and that even after Tzilla's death in 1967, the family continued to maintain friendships with their former Arab neighbors and visited each other until the outbreak of the first Intifada in 1987. \\"I hope\\", she said, \\"I will one day be able to visit the descendants of my great-grandparents' neighbors in Gaza.\\"  Philosophy of reading  Katzir has affirmed the importance of novels in a world saturated with digital media. \\"In our lives, we make intimate acquaintance with only a few people: close relatives, family, a few friends. Literature gives us the opportunity to meet many more souls, characters, people we can identify with.\\" She added that, \\"In a world that generates a lot of noise, books are oases of peace and quiet.\\" Awards and honors Katzir has won literary prizes in Israel and abroad, including the Book Publishers Association Gold and Platinum Book Prizes (1995; 1996; 1999; 2004); the Prime Minister's Prize (1996; 2007); and the French WIZO Prize (2004). Personal life Katzir and her husband Moshe Levinson, a film producer, have two daughters. They reside in Tel Aviv.

In this instance, during the campaigns for the 2018 presidential election, opposition candidate Henri Falc√≥n tried to intervene to bring the reporters, among press personnel from multiple other media, into the building; several were allowed in but the security said the bar on El Pitazo was too strict to allow them through. =Blocking of website= The El Pitazo website has been blocked on multiple occasions. Batiz said in August 2018 that none of the blocks thus far had been given an explanation, and that there had also been no reports against the website that would justify blocking it. The first block to website was implemented in early September 2017, by CANTV and Digitel, followed by Movistar in early November. Because of the decline in viewership the web address was changed from .com to .info on 15 January 2018. The new web address was then blocked in early April 2018 by CANTV, but the directors had been prepared and already set-up a web address hosted in Malaysia, .ml, which they switched to the same day. In early August 2018, the website was blocked by more providers than ever before; all of the previous ISPs as well as Inter and . The Press and Society Institute, Venezuela (IPYS) reported that this block was intermittent throughout the day and targeted different states at different times, making it a more complex \\"attack\\" on the website that was more difficult to circumvent and also harder to justify creating a new web address, even though the effect on readership was the same. For several weeks, other news websites‚Äîboth in the Rebel Alliance and not‚Äîpublished El Pitazo reports in solidarity; El Pitazo also used Facebook as a platform to host their reports and encouraged people to use VPNs to access their website. IPYS mentioned that they had developed some offline methods of communication in response, like holding informal public meetings in parks across the country and in bookshops to spread news. In an interview with Caracas Chronicles, Batiz said that he could guess the blocks were because he published reports that made the government \\"uncomfortable\\", like one in late July 2018 exposing corruption in PdVSA. , the 2018 President of the in the National Assembly (AN), presented a report to the AN in August 2018 that concluded that CANTV and the government agency Conatel were responsible for the blocks. Batiz planned to take the report to international human rights groups. =Cyber attacks= The website suffered several cyber attacks in June and July 2018. These came in the form of DDoS (a kind of denial of service attack), with over 1800 IPs targeting El Pitazo's current and past web addresses. Though still able to publish on social media during the denial of access, the attacks are characterized as a refusal of the right to free speech. During the August 2018 website blocks, the writers also received DDoS reports when trying to publish content, which is a targeted cyber attack not allowing them to access their own website. Notable reports and investigations In 2016, the El Pitazo editorial board contributed to Univision's coverage of the Narcosobrinos affair. =Hu√©rfanos de la Salud= El Pitazo co-created with IPYS the multimedia report on children who suffer due to poor health services in Venezuela. It won the 2018 Roche Health Journalism prize for Internet reports. It was also nominated in the Best Coverage category of the 2018 Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez Journalism Awards. The report can be found at IPYS, on Vimeo, and on YouTube. =La generaci√≥n del hambre= A supermarket in Los Teques, showing the scarcity of preservable food Throughout 2018 for eight months, fourteen journalists led by Johanna Osorio Herrera followed the lives of eight children all born in 2013, chosen because nutrition in the first 5 years of life is the most important. The report won the 2019 Ortega y Gasset Award for Best Multimedia Coverage, to be presented at the CaixaForum Madrid on 9 May 2019; for winning, they receive 15,000 euro and a sculpture by Eduardo Chillida. On announcing the award, the jury commended the journalists, saying that \\"They are a group of young and admirable journalists who take risks and who go to the places where things happen, to find the facts and report them\\". The aims of the investigation were to expose the effects of the economic policy of the Nicol√°s Maduro administration on young children growing up under it, particularly on hunger and starvation as these are \\"the most intimate in human lives\\". El Pa√≠s reported that the results were \\"saddening\\" because of the clear irreversible damage suffered by the infants, one of whom died during the process.

He was also responsible for the Commercial Code of 1850 that remains partly in force today. Early life He was the son of :pt:Eusebio de Queir√≥s Coutinho da Silva and Catarina Matoso de Queir√≥s C√¢mara. Both His father and grandfather served as superintendent magistrate of Angola. When he was only three years old, his family moved to Rio de Janeiro, where the court of the prince regent of Portugal, future king Jo√£o VI, was located. After exercising several positions as judge, his father was chosen to be a representative of Angola to the Portuguese Cortes (Constituent Assembly) in 1821, but soon joined the movement for the Independence of Brazil and was a member of the first Supreme Court of Justice of Brazil. Political career Eus√©bio de Queir√≥s graduated with a bachelor's degree in legal and social sciences from the Faculty of Law in Olinda in 1832. He was elected provincial representative as a Conservative for Rio de Janeiro in 1838. In 1842 he was elected to the National Assembly representing Rio de Janeiro, and was re- elected for four more terms. He was Chief of Police in Rio de Janeiro. He also served as Minister of Justice from 1848 to 1852 under the Marques de Olinda. The position at that time included the command of the National Guard, the Ecclesiastical Affairs (nomination of bishops, payment of priests and bishops) and the appointment of judges and chiefs of police. He was the author of one of the most important laws of the empire, the Lei Eus√©bio de Queir√≥s, promulgated on September 4, 1850, which prohibited the slave trade from Africa to Brazil. Although there had been similar laws before, it was under him as Minister of Justice that the Brazilian government for the first time acted effectively against the slave trade to Brazil (previous laws having been passed mainly to placate the British, who were committed to ending the slave trade internationally). Since he had been Chief of Police in Rio de Janeiro, he knew each of the places where smuggled Africans could be hidden. He also had good connections with the Rio businessmen who trafficked slaves from Africa. Using his information and relationships, he acted with severity in repressing the prohibited traffic, ensuring that it ceased abruptly. He steered through the law of June 25, 1850 enacting the first Commercial Code of Brazil. This remained in force until 2002 when the new Brazilian Civil Code incorporated Commercial Law. Until today, however, it remains in effect part of the Maritime Law of the Commercial Code of 1850. He promulgated the Land Law which extinguished traditional land grants and obliged public lands to be acquired by open auction, but also prevented newly arrived immigrants from buying land. He deployed the first law-based penitentiary system in Brazil, dedicating long stretches of his ministerial reports to the subject. He also worked with Irineu Evangelista de Sousa, Viscount of Mau√° to install the first gas lighting in Rio de Janeiro. After serving as a minister, he was a was judge, senator (1854) and member of the Council of State (1855). He was appointed Minister of the Supreme Court of Justice by decree of March 1, 1864. As this position was incompatible with that of State Councilor, he then asked for retirement, which was granted by Pedro II in a decree dated March 21, 1864. In the year of his death he resided in Rua Santa Teresa n¬∫ 9, in Rio de Janeiro. Family life Eus√©bio de Queir√≥s Matoso Ribeiro married Dona Raquel Francisca Castro Carneiro da Silva in Quissam√£. She was the daughter of his political ally Jos√© Carneiro da Silva, the first Baron and first Viscount of Araruama, leader of the Conservative Party in Rio de Janeiro. His son Manuel de Queir√≥s Matoso Ribeiro also married, in Quissam√£, Dona Anna Francisca de Loreto Lima Carneiro da Silva, daughter of Manuel Carneiro da Silva, viscount of Urura√≠. His daughter Catarina de Queir√≥s Matoso Ribeiro married, in S√£o Paulo, Rodrigo Augusto da Silva, son of his political ally Jos√© Manuel da Silva, Baron of Tiet√™, leader of the Conservative Party in S√£o Paulo. Eus√©bio was great-grandfather of Eus√©bio de Queir√≥s Matoso Barbosa, a major businessman in the capital of S√£o Paulo; great-great-grandfather of the historian Gilberto de Queir√≥s Matoso, as well as of two mayors of Quissam√£, Arnaldo de Queir√≥s Matoso and Armando Cunha Carneiro da Silva.

Passed into law in 2019, the Act bans the capture and keeping in captivity of cetaceans (the biological taxon comprising whales, dolphins, and porpoises). There is a grandfather clause for cetaceans in captivity when the law first came into force, and other exceptions, such as where a provincial government has issued a licence to keep cetaceans for research purposes. History In 2015, then-Senator Wilfred Moore of the Senate of Canada introduced Bill S-203. At the time of its introduction, only two facilities kept live cetaceans in Canada. Marineland of Canada keeps beluga whales, dolphins and a killer whale for commercial display. Vancouver Aquarium still kept one killer whale. Both Marineland and the Vancouver Aquarium opposed the bill. Marineland believes that it advances an agenda of entrenching animal rights into the legal framework: \\"the granting of the rights of a person to whales ‚Äî what activists call a 'non- human person' ‚Äî and then to other species\\". The bill would \\"fundamentally and critically damage Marineland\\" and \\"essentially destroy Marineland's future\\". Marineland believes that it has enough belugas, but it would like to get some more porpoises in the future and a companion for its one orca. The Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) association issued an open letter asking the Senators to reject the bill. The Vancouver Aquarium opposed the bill on the grounds it would impede their research and not allow them to put on display any animals under rescue or it felt were not releasable to the wild. In September 2017, Green Party of Canada leader Elizabeth May filed a complaint to the Parliament of Canada's Lobbying Commissioner about Marineland's breaches of the Canadian Lobbying Act. Marineland had privately lobbied Members of Parliament and Senators without registering with the Lobbying Commissioner in efforts to stop Bill S-203. Marineland's lawyer Andrew Burns registered as a lobbyist in May 2018. Conservatives in the Senate, led by Senator Don Plett, used procedural obstruction to keep the bill from moving to a vote. In June 2018, the senators added amendments intended to exclude Marineland and the Vancouver Aquarium from being covered by the bill. The bill was passed by the Senate in October 2018 and was sent to the House of Commons of Canada. The bill passed first reading in the House of Commons and was referred to the Fisheries Committee for review. Burns appeared at a House Fisheries Committee meeting in March 2019, to propose an amendment regarding future beluga births at Marineland, claiming the new law is unconstitutional. Senator Murray Sinclair, the bill's second sponsor in the Senate and a former judge, told MPs no one is going to be prosecuted when currently pregnant belugas give birth. In the opinion of Sinclair and May, Burns was only intending to delay the bill, so that it could not be passed before the end of the current session of the Parliament of Canada. The bill was passed by committee without amendments. Faced with a backlog of bills prior to the conclusion of the session of Parliament before the 2019 election, the Trudeau government extended the hours that the Commons would sit. The Act passed third and final reading in the House of Commons on June 10, 2019. It received Royal Assent on June 21, 2019. Sections Under the Criminal Code, it is now an offence to own or breed cetaceans in captivity. Exceptions are provided for those who already have such animals in captivity at the time the bill took effect, those who are assisting an animal in distress, those undertaking research or under a license by a Lieutenant-Governor or their designates. Fines are no more than . Under the Fisheries Act, it bans the moving of any live cetacean from the immediate vicinity, except if the animal is in distress. Under the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act, the Act would have banned the import or export of live animals, embryos, sperm and tissue cultures except where a license is granted by the Minister. However, these provisions of the Act were deemed never to have come into force and were repealed, by operation of subsection 58.1(8) of An Act to amend the Fisheries Act and other Acts in consequence, which also came into effect on June 21, 2019. Section 6 of the Act is a for-greater-certainty clause, clarifying that the other provisions of the Act do not subtract anything from existing aboriginal rights or treaty rights recognized and affirmed in Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The new provisions are section 445.2 of the Criminal Code and sections 23.1 to 23.6 of the Fisheries Act. The provisions of the Fisheries Act set out additional exceptions to the prohibition in section 445.2 of the Criminal Code. These were enacted by sections 15 and 58.1 of An Act to amend the Fisheries Act and other Acts in consequence,S.C. 2019, c. 14 () which was also given royal assent on June 21, 2019. Additionally, section 58.3 of that Act operates as a grandfather clause to the prohibition against breeding (and possessing reproductive materials), in respect of a cetacean that is gestating on the day the legislation entered into force. Reactions The Canadian branch of Humane Society International called the Act a \\"landmark victory\\" and \\"a watershed moment in the protection of marine animals\\". Marineland of Canada, which had been a vocal opponent of the legislative proposal, had argued the law would devastate attendance at its park, threaten conservation efforts, and threaten summer employment of hundreds of local residents. Its lawyer also argued the law was unconstitutional. After the bill passed, Marineland issued a statement saying it would comply with all animal welfare legislation in Canada, and it is confident its operations remain compliant with all aspects of the bill. John Gustavsson, president and CEO of the parent company of the Vancouver Aquarium, said \\"You can have a world-class conservation aquarium without whales and dolphins and that‚Äôs what we don‚Äôt have. We have no intention not to follow Canadian law ‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs not controversial for me.\\" See also * Dolphinarium References External links * Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act (at Canlii) * Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act (at Department of Justice) * The Whale, Inside: Ending Cetacean Captivity in Canada (Canadian Journal of Comparative and Contemporary Law) Canadian federal legislation 2019 in Canadian law Cetaceans Animal welfare and rights legislation Animal welfare and rights in Canada Fisheries law Whale conservation ","title":"Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act"},{"id":"60493771","title":"List of 2017 box office number-one films in Colombia"},{"id":"60493779","text":"is a Japanese professional footballer who currently plays for Colorado Springs Switchbacks in the USL Championship.

As Timur's favourite grandson, Muhammad Sultan served as one of his principal military commanders, helping lead forces in successful campaigns against the Golden Horde, Persian kingdoms and the Ottoman Empire. Described by the historian Arabshah as \\"a manifest prodigy in his noble nature and vigour\\", Muhammad Sultan was eventually appointed by Timur as heir-apparent to the empire. His premature death in 1403 greatly affected his grandfather. Background Muhammad Sultan was born in 1375, the elder son of Jahangir Mirza and the only one by his wife, the Sufi princess Khanzada Begum. His father, Timur's favourite son and original heir, died within a few months of his birth. His mother, a maternal granddaughter of Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, was subsequently remarried to Jahangir's younger brother Miran Shah. Military career In 1386, Timur captured Tabriz, the capital of the Jalairid Sultanate. Muhammad Sultan, then only ten years old, was appointed governor of the city. Five years later, he accompanied his grandfather in his invasion of the territory of Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde. Initially part of the scouting parties which preceded the army, Timur later gave him command of the army centre, a position he held during the ensuing Battle of the Kondurcha River in June 1391. In 1393, he took part in the campaign against the Muzaffarids of Fars. He, along with his younger half-brother Pir Muhammad, were sent through Kurdistan, capturing various provinces, with orders to later re-join the main army. Timur himself pursued the Muzaffarid king, Shah Mansur. The armies of the two rulers met outside the city of Shiraz; Timur entrusted his left flank to Muhammad Sultan, the right to Pir Muhammad whilst the centre was given to their uncle Shah Rukh. The battle ultimately resulted in a Timurid victory, with Shah Mansur being killed by Timur's soldiers and his lands subsequently being incorporated into the empire. Muhammad Sultan once more joined Timur in his war against Tokhtamysh in 1395, accompanying the emperor in a second invasion of the Golden Horde. He led the right wing of the army during the Battle of the Terek River and inflicted heavy damage on the Khan's left flank, forcing it into retreat, with Tokhtamysh himself fleeing soon after. The following year, he was dispatched to the kingdom of Hormuz on the Persian Gulf. After capturing various provincial forts, the prince compelled the ruler, Muhammad Shah, to submit. In 1397, he was named governor of the eastern province of Ferghana. With the idea of an eventual campaign against China in mind, Timur ordered his grandson to consolidate bases in the region, as well as develop soil cultivation along the route. Muhammad Sultan was given an army of forty thousand and had a fort built in the region of Ashapara, followed by another further east by the Issyk-Kul. The prince intended to use these as a frontier line for operations against the neighbouring kingdom of Moghulistan in 1399. However, this plan was forestalled when his cousin, Iskandar Mirza, drew on Muhammad Sultan's detachments at Ashpara to launch a raid into Chinese Turkestan. This arbitrary action resulted in a grudge between the two princes. Less than a year later, after Iskandar had been transferred to Ferghana while Muhammad Sultan himself was named custodian of Samarqand, the latter had his cousin captured and detained within the city. Iskandar's atabeg and twenty-six of his nobles were executed. Reports of Timur's reaction to the feud are contradictory; one account states that Timur blamed Muhammad Sultan for the dispute and upheld Iskandar, ordering restitution for his nobles. Another says that Timur sided with the former and had Iskandar's feet whipped as punishment. The prince supposedly pushed Timur to pursue his campaign against the Delhi Sultanate in 1398. The Malfuzat-i Timuri, an alleged autobiography of the emperor, ascribes the following speech to Muhammad Sultan: As Timur's heir Sometime prior to his Indian invasion, Timur had Muhammad Sultan appointed as his heir apparent. When Delhi was conquered in December 1398, Timur had the khutba read there, with the prince's name being said alongside his own. Coins were also struck with Muhammad Sultan's name and title \\"Vali al-lakhd\\" (throne-heir) following that of Timur and the puppet-Chagatai Khan. The emperor's choice in successor was mainly based on birth, rather than position or accomplishment; in addition to the prince's own exalted maternal lineage, his father Jahangir, alone of Timur's four sons was born of a free-wife, as opposed to a concubine. In 1399, he was named governor of Turan. This was followed two years later by an appointment over the lands of the former Mongol Ilkhanate, which Timur termed \\"the throne of Hulagu.\\" These lands had previously been governed by Muhammad Sultan's disgraced uncle/stepfather Miran Shah. In 1402, Timur began military engagements in anticipation for his campaign against the Ottoman Sultan, Bayezid I. This was initiated by Muhammad Sultan, recently summoned from Samarqand, besieging and storming the fortress at Kamakh. This was a direct challenge and provocation to Bayezid, who had only recently captured the stronghold from Timur's ally, Taharten. The war culminated on 20 July 1402 with the Battle of Ankara, during which Muhammad Sultan led the main body of the army. The Ottoman forces were decisively defeated, with Bayezid himself being taken captive soon after. Immediately following the battle, the prince was dispatched to the Ottoman capital of Bursa to seize Bayezid's treasury. However, he was narrowly beaten there by the Ottoman prince S√ºleyman √áelebi, who removed many of the city's greatest treasures. What remained was plundered by the Timurid army, including the gold and enamel inlaid bronze gates, which were later presented to Timur's empress, Saray Mulk Khanum. After the pillaging concluded, Muhammad Sultan had the city torched. Death and burial Mourning over the catafalque of Muhammad Sultan, an illustration from Yazdi's Zafarnama Gur-i-Amir Muhammad Sultan was ordered to march back through Ankara to re-join the main army at Kayseri. However, during this journey the prince, already suffering from injuries sustained during the recent battle, fell seriously ill. He died on 12 March 1403, near the city of Afyonkarahisar. Timur bitterly grieved his grandson's passing and ordered the entire army wear dark clothing in mourning. A two hundred horse procession accompanied Muhammad Sultan's body to the fortress of Avnik. From there, he was taken to be temporarily buried in the mazar of Qedar, near the city of Soltaniyeh. On the anniversary of his death the following year, Muhammad Sultan's remains, accompanied by his mother, were taken for reburial in Samarqand. He was interred in a vault that bore his name, the Khangah-i Muhammad Sultan, part of an existing complex of religious buildings previously erected by the prince. Upon his own death in 1405, Timur was buried there alongside his grandson. Finally, both bodies were moved once more to their present resting-place in the Gur-i-Amir, likely around 1409 by Timur's successor Shah Rukh. The tomb, originally intended for Muhammad Sultan alone, became the Timurid dynastic mausoleum.

He is best known for his work with herbaceous perennial plants.  Education and training  Arends was born to the nurseryman Karl Arends and Sophie Steckel on 21 September 1863 in Essen, Prussia. Since he was the seventh of twelve children and was not the eldest son, he was not expected to inherit the family's plant nursery. He nevertheless became interested in plants, training at Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute and completing an apprenticeship at the Botanical Garden of Breslau. Arends moved to the United Kingdom in 1885, where he was exposed to a relaxed garden style that differed from German trend in putting more emphasis on perennials than on shrubs. After a year of working in a nursery in Tottenham, Arends went to the Imperial Free City of Trieste, where he was trained by Giulio Perotti.  Career  Arends returned to his homeland in 1888, and started a nursery in Wuppertal. The business took off. On 14 May 1891, he married Helene Pfeifer, with whom he had two sons, Erich and Werner. By the beginning of the 20th century, Arends started selectively breeding perennials. Among the earliest plants he bred selectively were Astilbe, which gained popularity thanks to his work. Through hybridization he created more brightly colored plants known as Astilbe Arendsii Group. Phlox √ó arendsii originated in 1912, when Arends crossed the impressively blooming P. paniculata with the compact P. divaricata. Another popular hybrid created by Arends is Aconitum x arendsii. Arends created around 350 hybrids that bear his name. Arends' nursery was almost entirely destroyed during the Allied bombing of Germany in the Second World War. Arends and his sons rebuilt it, but its reputation faded as the aging Arends refused to pass it on. Arends died on 5 March 1952 in Wuppertal-Ronsdorf. His business was inherited by his sons, but Erich sold his share to for housing development. The nursery established by Arends passed from Werner to his daughter Ursula, and it is today owned by her daughter Anja Maubach.

He belonged to the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty as a son of Cormac na Haoine, the 13th Prince of Carbery. His epithet \\"of the Pipes\\" (na bp√≠opa√≠ in Irish) originates from when several pipes of wine washed up on the beach at Burren, which was traditionally believed to be a sign of good fortune for him. Although he surrendered Carbery to the Crown in 1606 he does not appear to have been granted a peerage in return (as was typical). However, as seen in the 1607 pedigree, he is listed being \\"Lord of Carbery\\" and as such the family was able to retain a vast yearly income. Donal na Pipi's son, Cormac, predeceased him leaving an only son, Donal of Kilbrittain, who died in 1636. Upon his death an inquisition was taken of the family and it was determined that the MacCarthy Reagh was still collecting yearly rents from various Irish chiefs that all totaled ¬£207 16s 11¬ºd per annum. This sum doesn't include any revenue from his 70¬Ω demesne ploughlands, and is approximately equivalent to ¬£1,056,000 in 2018. A projection of the Principality of Carbery, circa 1606, upon a modern map of Ireland's baronies. This map would have been the extent of the territory surrendered by Donal na Pipi. Donal na Pipi is widely known due to his conflict with his cousin, Florence, over the succession to the chiefship as Prince of Carbery. Donal notoriously broke a promise to Florence when he violated his bond with Florence for ¬£10,000 and surrendered the territory and lordship of Carbery to King James I in 1606. Although it can only be speculated, it seems Donal may have realized that English conquest was by now a sure thing, and the best way (despite his personal ambitions) to preserve Carbery was to opt for surrender and regrant. The family's native Irish allegiance can hardly be called into question, as just fours years earlier, although Donal na Pipi remained visibly neutral, his cousin fought alongside The O'Sullivan Beare against the English at the Battle of Kinsale.  Carbery  By comparing W.F.T. Butler's map, 'The Barony of Carbery in Tudor Times,' with modern land surveys, we can estimate that at the time Donal surrendered Carbery, it comprised the modern baronies of West Carbery (East and West Divisions), East Carbery (East and West Divisions), Kinalmeaky, and Ibane and Barryroe. Which would equate to 436,478.1 acres (682 square miles) in size, or just over 2% of Ireland's total size. In medieval Ireland (prior to its incorporation as a petty kingdom) it was the largest barony, and that superlative would remain true today. In fact, if it were reestablished today as its own kingdom it would rank a respectable 180th out of the world's recognized 225 countries and dependencies by land area.  Family  Donal married Margaret FitzGerald, daughter of Sir Thomas Ruadh FitzGerald and Ellice Poer, and the granddaughter of James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. Ellie Poer was the daughter of Sir Richard Poer, 1st Baron le Power and Coroghmore, and Catherine Butler, daughter of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond, and Margaret FitzGerald. Through Donal's marriage to Margaret, he had two sons. Donal na Pipi had his eldest son, Cormac, who predeceased him, and then a grandson, Donal MacCarthy Reagh who married Ellen Roche of Fermoy, daughter of David Roche, 7th Viscount Fermoy. This Donal had a son, Cormac who married Eleanor, sister of Donough MacCarty, 1st Earl of Clancarty, by whom he had two sons whose progeny are the senior branches of the MacCarthy Reagh alive today. Donal na Pipi's younger son, Owen, founded the Springhouse branch of the dynasty. The senior representatives of the Springhouse McCarthys would become the Count MacCarthy Reagh of Toulouse in 1766, but the last male issue of that line died in 1906.

She studies robustness and feedback in highly connected complex systems, which have applications in a variety of areas including earthquakes, wildfires and neuroscience.  Early life and education  Carlson studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton University and graduated in 1984. She moved to Cornell University for her graduate studies, earning a master's in applied physics 1987. In 1987 she switched to theoretical condensed matter physics for her doctoral studies and completed her PhD in 1988. She worked under the supervision of James Sethna on the spin glass model in the Bethe Lattice. Carlson worked in the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics as a postdoctoral scholar with James S. Langer.  Research and career  Carlson was appointed to the faculty at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1990. She works on the fundamental theory and applications of complex systems. She was awarded a David and Lucile Packard Foundation fellowship in 1993, which allowed her to study the physical and mathematical principles that underlie complexity. Carlson uses highly optimized tolerance (HOT) methods that connect evolving structure with power laws in highly interconnected systems. Carlson developed the HOT mechanism in the early 2000s, and has since applied it to complex systems including the immune system, earthquakes, wildfires and neuroscience. HOT represents a unifying framework that can couple with external environments, which differs from self-organized criticality and the edge of chaos. Carlson has used computational systems biology to understand the immune system. She studies how the immune system changes with age, as well as automimmune disease and homeostasis. Carlson worked with Eric Jones to develop a mathematical model that can analyse and predict interactions in the gut bacteria of fruit flies. It is hoped that this model will be able to explain the human gut microbiome. Their model demonstrated that the interaction between bacteria in the gut are as important to the overall health of a fruit fly as their presence in the gut. She has also applied complexity theory to neuroscience, identifying the properties of neural networks that are protected in the healthy population. Understanding these networks could explain the connection between the structure of white matter and cognitive function. Carlson looks to explain how neural networks are involved with learning and memory, by comparing them to computational and biological information processing structures. Carlson is particularly interested in sequential learning; which combines new information with previous knowledge. Her work combines computational models with experimental data from electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging. She demonstrated that the parts of the brain that synchronise their activity during memory-related tasks become smaller but more numerous as people age. The application of statistical mechanics to materials science could help to describe the characteristics of granular materials. She applies shear transformation zone theory to granular material to describe how they flow and jam. This work contributes to her studies of friction in earthquake faults, rate-and-state laws and rheological chaos. Carlson has studied complexity in several areas of earthquake physics, including dynamic rupture and supershear. She developed an algorithm (Highly Optimized Tolerance Fire Spread Model, HFire) that can model the spread of a wildfire, which can be used to understand the longterm evolution of forest ecosystems and helping to coordinate forest management. She has investigated human decision-making in disaster response, in an effort to make evacuations more safe and effective. She has investigated the tradeoffs that arise in wildfire response, using models of the economy, populations and fire spread. This requires dynamic decision tools, as time delays can result in more fires and demand for resources. She has also studied how information networks impact decisions, and the relationship between information dissemination and social sharing. Carlson has also applied complexity theory to econophysics, evolution and control theory. She holds visiting Professorships at Santa Fe Institute.

She held her first international fight on April 14, 2019 where she defeated Anne Chauvin from France. Khadem is the first female boxer since the Iranian Revolution to compete in an official boxing contest and the first Iranian woman to win an official match. This match is particularly important because female boxing has been prohibited since the Iranian Revolution. Khadem and her trainer, Mahyar Monshipour, had been expected to return to Tehran after the win. However, she canceled return to Iran after arrest warrant issued due to breaching dress rules for women in Iran.  Biography  Sadaf Khadem in 2019. Khadem began her athletic career at the age of 9. She was particularly interest in basketball. Watching professional basketball players train in boxing to increase their morale, she began training as well. Her training began in Tehran and subsequently she continued in Varamin despite the long commute from her home. Though she was accepted to college to pursue a sports engineering degree, she eventually dropped out to put full time focus on boxing. Alongside her own training, she held fitness and basketball classes as well. Mahyar Monshipour became her boxing trainer in 2008 and in 2014 she accepted an official boxing match invitation from France despite opposition from the Ministry of Sports of Iran.  Defeating French Opponent  On April 14, 2019 Khadem participated in her first official match in Royan, France. Her opponent Anne Chauvin was a French boxer. Khadem defeated Chauvin at the end of a three round match with Monshipour as her trainer. After the match, Khadem embraced her opponent with tears in her eyes. She declared that \\"this victory belongs to all the men and women who sacrificed their lives for Iran.\\" She further added that \\"this was the first step.\\"  Reception  The prospect of Khadem's match with Chauvin attracted French and other international media attention. The match was broadcast on a dedicated channel as well as several local ones. The match was dubbed by the hosts as \\"an effort to bring equality among women and men.\\" Following Khadem's victory, the mayor of Royan congratulated Monshipour and Khadem inside the ring. The Iranian Boxing Federation distanced itself from the match and released a statement reading: > As women's boxing is not a sanctioned sport of the Islamic Republic of Iran > Boxing Federation, the organization, training, and participation in this > sport is not related to this federation and it is the organizer and > participant's responsibilities. Following the match, Khadem and Monshipour had plans to return to Iran, however, lingering rumors of potential arrest warrants kept them in France.

After winning a minor race on her debut in 2018 she won the Saudi Arabia Royal Cup before running third in the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes. On her first appearance as a three-year-old she won the Oka Sho. Background Gran Alegria is a bay filly with a white star bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During her racing career she has carried the colours of Sunday Racing and has been trained by Kazuo Fujisawa. The filly has been ridden in most of her races by Christophe Lemaire. She was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Gran Alegria's dam Tapitsfly was a top class American racemare whose wins included the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf, Just A Game Stakes and First Lady Stakes. She was exported to Japan after being sold for $1,850,000 at the Fasig-Tipton sale. She was a female-line descendant of Pink Dove, who was a half-sister to Golden Pheasant. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= Gran Alegria made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 3 June and won by two lengths from fourteen opponents headed by Danon Fantasy. After a four- month break the filly returned for the Grade 3 Saudi Arabia Royal Cup over the same course and distance on 6 October when she was matched against male opposition. Starting the 3/10 favourite she came home three and a half lengths clear of the colt De Gaulle. Instead of contesting Japan's premier race for two-year-old fillies, the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies (which was won in her absence by Danon Fantasy), Gran Alegria faced the colts again in the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 16 December and was made the 1/2 favourite. After racing in second place for most of the way she disputed the lead with Admire Mars in the straight before fading in the final strides and coming home third behind Admire Mars and the 76/1 outsider Kurino Gaud√≠. =2019: three-year-old season= Gran Alegria began her second campaign in the Grade 1 Oka Sho over 2000 metres at Hanshin on 6 April in which she started the 2.4/1 second favourite behind Danon Fantasy. The other sixteen runners included Chrono Genesis (Daily Hai Queen Cup) as well as No One and Pourville who had run a dead-heat in the Fillies' Revue. After racing in fourth behind the front-running Pourville, Gran Alegria took the lead entering the straight, broke clear of the field and came home two and a half lengths clear of Shigeru Pink Dia. Her winning time of 1:32.7 broke the race record set by Almond Eye in 2018. Christophe Lemaire commented \\"She certainly won strongly today. I was a little bit worried as it was her first time out after a long break. She was unable to make use of her speed in the Asahi Hai Futurity so I made sure this time to secure a good position early on and from there I had every confidence in her exceptional speed.\\" On 5 May Gran Alegria was matched against colts again when she was dropped back in distance for the NHK Mile Cup over 1600 metres at Tokyo and started the odds-on favourite. After tracking the leaders she kept on the straight but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and came home fourth behind Admire Mars. She was subsequently relegated to fifth for causing interference. The filly did not return to the track until 21 December when she was matched against older horses in the 1400 metre Hanshin Cup and started the 1.1/1 favourite. Lemaire settled Gran Alegria in mid-division before moving to the front 200 metres from the finish and pulling clear to win by five lengths from the five-year- old Fiano Romano. In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Gran Alegria took the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly, taking 121 of the 274 votes to win from Loves Only You and Chrono Genesis.

He was ambassador to several countries, and also served as a senator in the Governing Senate. Born into a noble family as the son of an eminent general of Empress Elizabeth's service, Aleksandr Bibikov was enrolled into the lists of the Izmaylovsky Regiment at just three years old. After his father's death on campaign in 1774, the younger Bibikov was promoted to officer status at nine years old, and by the time he was old enough to join the ranks of his regiment, he already held the rank of captain. He served in the Empress Catherine's retinue for a time, before taking part in the Russo- Swedish War, and seeing action on a number of occasions. Wounded in battle, and presented several awards, he entered the civil service during the years of peace, and was given various state and diplomatic appointments by the Emperor Paul I. After a series of brief postings to the Portuguese court and the Electorate of Saxony, he was for a time unemployed during the early reign of Emperor Alexander I, though he eventually returned to serve in various diplomatic and civil service roles. With Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, Bibikov petitioned to serve in the army once more, and was appointed to command various militias, including those of St Petersburg and Novgorod. He and his forces distinguished themselves at the Second Battle of Polotsk, and at the Battle of Smoliani, where he was wounded in the leg. Unable to ride or walk, he fought the next two battles, at Borisov and Berezina, from a sleigh, and when his horses were killed at Berezina, he leant against one of his adjutants. His forces pursued the French on their retreat from Russia, though Bibikov was forced eventually to resign due to ill health. He returned to his political duties for a time in St Petersburg, and wrote an account of his father's life and campaigns. He died in 1822 while seeking treatment abroad, and was interred in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. Family and early life Bibikov was born into an ancient dvoryan family on 7 January 1765; the son of the distinguished general Aleksandr Ilyich Bibikov, who had served Empress Elizabeth of Russia, and his wife, Princess Anastasia Semyonovna Kozlovskaya. He was also the nephew of Mikhail Kutuzov, another distinguished military commander. The younger Bibikov was first entered into the books of the Izmaylovsky Regiment as a non-commissioned officer in 1768 at the age of just three, and granted the rank of sergeant that same year. After the elder Bibikov's death on campaign in 1774, the regiment, in recognition of his father's service, promoted the 9-year old Bibikov to ensign in 1774. He transferred to the Preobrazhensky Regiment and by the time he came of age and was actually able to physically join the regiment on 1 January 1787, he already held the rank of captain. He had by this time, on 22 September 1786, entered service with the Empress Catherine's household. Bibikov was part of the Empress's retinue during her 1787 visit to Taurida, and was awarded a gold medal in memory of the visit. Russo-Swedish War Battle of Rochensalm, saw Bikikov fighting as part of Vice-Admiral Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen's galley fleet. With the outbreak of the Russo-Swedish War in 1788, Bibikov volunteered to enter the corps of Lieutenant-General Ivan Michelson, who had served with Bibikov's father and now took the younger Bibikov under his patronage. In the Swedish campaign, Bibikov participated in the reconnaissance of the Swedish outpost at Gokforsky around the village of Kiro, near Wilmanstrand. In a subsequent engagement at the village Bibikov and two grenadiers captured a Swedish cannon. In preliminary operations around Porrassalmi on 1 June 1789, he was wounded in the left leg by a bullet, and in the Battle of Porrassalmi Bibikov commanded a company and was again wounded. For bravery in action he was awarded the Order of St. George Fourth Class on 9 June 1789. He was again in action on 9 July 1789, clashing with Swedish forces as they passed through Kyumen towards Memele, and again at Memele on 29 July. Bibikov then joined the Russian galley fleet, under Vice-Admiral Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen, and distinguished himself at the Battle of Rochensalm in August 1789, and at the disembarkation at the mouth of Kymi on 21 August, where he commanded a battalion of the Preobrazhensky Regiment. For these latter actions he was on 30 August 1789 awarded the ceremonial Golden Sword \\"For Bravery\\". Civil and diplomatic postings With the conclusion of the war in 1790, Bibikov returned to St. Petersburg and spent the next five years serving with the regiment. In 1795 he entered the civil service and was appointed a Valet de chambre, and then chamberlain on 31 May 1795. With the accession of Paul I as emperor, Bibikov was dispatched on 13 November 1796 to give notice to the Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Bibikov was a favourite of the new emperor, who on 1 October 1798 made him one of his secret advisers, and on 7 November 1798 appointed him to the College of Foreign Affairs. Bibikov was then dispatched on various diplomatic duties, serving as Extraordinary Envoy and Plenipotentiary Minister to the Portuguese court from 22 December 1798, and then as extraordinary envoy to the Electorate of Saxony from 1 January 1799. He was recalled on 28 February 1799 and on 7 January 1800 was appointed a herald, and to sit in the Governing Senate with the Order of St. Anna First Class. From 12 January Bibikov was part of the Provisional Land Survey Department, but left on 1 February 1800. With the calling up of the militias in 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, Bibikov was on 16 December appointed police chief of Oranienbaum district. He resumed his diplomatic career in 1808, with a posting on 10 February as extraordinary envoy and plenipotentiary minister to the Kingdom of Naples. He was recalled to St. Petersburg on 22 February 1810, and on 20 December 1810 was once more appointed to the Senate, serving in the second branch of the 5th department, and from 8 May 1811 in the first branch of the 3rd department. With Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, Bibikov petitioned his uncle, Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov, for a post, and was given command of a detachment of the St. Petersburg militia. Bibikov now commanded a force of 5,575 people, including 4,000 militiamen, supplemented with the attachment of two squadrons of the Grodno hussars and the Polish Uhlan regiment. Bibikov and his force left St. Petersburg on 3 September, uniting with Peter Wittgenstein's army on 28 September. Wittgenstein then placed Bibikov in command of the entire St. Petersburg and Novgorod militias. Action in the Napoleonic Wars The Battle of Polotsk, by Peter von Hess. Bibikov and his militia played a key role in storming the city. Bibikov and his militia went into action on 6 October 1812 took part in the Second Battle of Polotsk. The militia took the lead in storming the city, and were the first troops to enter it. For his service at the battle he was later awarded the Order of St. George Third Class on 3 January 1813. With the combining of Wittgenstein's force with Fabian Steinheil's Bibikov was given command over the front line of the army, consisting of the Perm, Sevsk and Kaluga infantry regiments, chasseurs and cavalry squadrons, and 30 cannon. Bibikov and his men fought at Battle of Chashniki on 31 October 1812, and at Battle of Smoliani on 13-14 November. At Smoliani Bibikov was wounded in the leg by a bullet, but remained on the battlefield until the end. He went on to see action at the Battle of Borisov, and at the Battle of Berezina from 26 to 29 November 1812. Unable to walk or ride because of his wound, he commanded the battle while being moved around on a sleigh; when the team of horses pulling the sleigh were killed, he supported himself by leaning on the shoulder of an adjutant. Napoleon's crossing of the Berezina, a 1866 painting by January Suchodolski. Wounded in an earlier engagement, Bibikov fought the battle from a sleigh. In December Bibikov and his forces, pursuing the retreating French, entered Prussia. His militia had suffered heavily during the campaign, with only 900 surviving from his original force of 12,000. They nevertheless fought at Pitkonen and Labiau, and at the occupation of K√∂nigsberg. Bibikov then asked Wittgenstein for permission to stay at K√∂nigsberg to reorganise his severely reduced forces. While resting at K√∂nigsberg his forces presented him with a golden sword with the inscriptions \\"For faith and the Tsar\\", and \\"To Senator Bibikov, from the St. Petersburg militia\\". After reorganising his forces, Bibikov advanced his men to Pillau, and on 6 February 1813 joined the forces besieging Danzig. Here Bibikov fell ill and was forced to return to K√∂nigsberg for a period to recuperate. He rejoined the siege on 16 June and was assigned to command the Kaluga militia. He carried out a restructuring of the militia, before gaining permission on 10 July to resign on health grounds. As a mark of favour for his service, Emperor Alexander I gave permission for Bibikov to continue to wear his militia general's uniform. Bibikov took a leave of absence from the Senate on 15 October 1813, returning to St. Petersburg for a period, before resuming his post in the first branch of the 3rd Department of the Senate. During this time he wrote a history of his father's service in Pugachev's Rebellion, Notes on the Life and Service of Alexander Ilyich Bibikov, which was published in St. Petersburg in 1817. Bibikov's portrait was one of those painted by the studio of George Dawe for display in the Military Gallery of the Winter Palace, to commemorate the important generals and military leaders of the war with France. Later life Bibikov's wife, Anna Vasilyevna, in a portrait by √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun Bibikov left St. Petersburg on 25 April 1821 to seek treatment at the spa town of Carlsbad, and died while abroad, on 1 August 1822 at Dresden. His body was returned to St Petersburg to be buried in the Lazarevskoe Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. He had married Anna Vasilyevna Khanykova, the daughter of State Counselor Vasily Klimovich Khanykov. Anna Vasilyevna survived her husband for four years, and was buried next to him in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. The couple had three children together, their eldest son Vasily (1793‚Äì1867) also served in the army during the war of 1812, later reaching the rank of major general. They also had a second son, Aleksandr, who believed to be in romantic relationship with Maria Gartung, the older daughter of Alexander Pushkin, and a daughter, Aleksandra, who married Major-General N.

It has a masthead sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a sloped transom, a transom-hung and keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel, with the forefoot cutaway. It displaces . The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Westerbeke two-cylinder diesel engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The cabin has two design interior versions, both using teak trim. One has a forward head, just aft of the \\"V\\"-berth, while the other has an aft head, in place of the chart table and a dresser in the forward cabin. The forward cabin has a privacy curtain. The galley is located aft, on the starboard side, just ahead of the companionway stairs and has an optional two-burner stove. A shower is also optional and uses freshwater engine cooling to heat the water. Ventilation is via nine opening ports. The genoa has tracks and the mainsheet traveler is mounted aft of the cockpit. Operational history In a review Richard Sherwood described the design, \\"Annie is a heavy-displacement boat, but she has a very tall rig and much greater sail area in the jib than older boats. In addition, freeboard is low, the bow is sharp, and the keel is quite narrow. The forefoot is cut away. With the long keel and the heavy displacement, Annie should track well. The tall rig will assist in light air.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types *Annie (sloop) - a historic boat with the same name Similar sailboats *Alberg 30 *Alberg Odyssey 30 *Aloha 30 *Bahama 30 *Bristol 29.9 *C&C; 30 *C&C; 30 Redwing *Catalina 30 *Catalina 309 *CS 30 *Grampian 30 *Hunter 30 *Hunter 30T *Hunter 30-2 *Hunter 306 *Kirby 30 *Leigh 30 *Mirage 30 *Mirage 30 SX *Nonsuch 30 *O'Day 30 *Pearson 303 *S2 9.2 *Seafarer 30 *Southern Cross 28 *Tanzer 31 References Keelboats 1980s sailboat type designs Sailing yachts ","title":"Annie 30"},{"id":"60494257","text":"Susan Goethel Campbell (born 1956) is an American book artist known for her mixed media works that explore aspects of the natural environment.

Early life and career  Yosef Yitzchak Jacobson was born on June 11, 1972 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and grew up there as part of a Chabad Hasidic family. He started his studies in Oholei Torah, after which he moved to study in Chabad's Central Tomchei Temimim Yeshiva of 770 Eastern Parkway. In 1988, at the age of 15, Yosef Yitzchak was recruited by his brother Simon to join the team that prepared the public addresses of Menachem Mendel Schneerson for publication. This role is known as a choizer or meiniach. Not being able to use recording devices because of Shabbat and Jewish Holidays observance, they were charged with memorizing talks, lasting many hours. After Shabbat or the Jewish Holidays he would get together with the rest of the team to transcribe those public addresses. As a senior fellow, Jacobson taught Talmud, Kabbalah, and Hasidic philosophy at Chabad Lubavitch Rabbinical Seminary Chovevei Torah. Jacobson was initially tested on his semikhah (rabbinic ordination) by Pinhas Hirschprung as well as by Zalman Labkowsky. Having to still complete a last part of his test, Jacobson returned to 770 in 2011 to get tested and receive his rabbinical ordination through Labkowsky. In 2005, Jacobson followed in the footsteps of his late father Gershon Jacobson as editor-in-chief of the Yiddish weekly Algemeiner Journal, which he contributed to for a number of years. He is a mashpia (spiritual mentor) at the Chovevei Torah Yeshiva in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and a teacher at the Ohr Chaim Learning Center in Monsey, New York.

She combines statistical mechanics and computational modelling to understand complex materials.  Early life and education  Del Gado studied physics at the University of Naples Federico II. She graduated cum laude before earning her doctoral degree at the same university. Del Gado was appointed a Marie Curie Fellow in 2001, working with Walter Kob at the University of Montpellier II. She worked as a postdoctoral scholar with Hans Christian Oettinger at ETH Zurich.  Research and career  From 2010 Del Gado served as a Swiss National Science Foundation Professor at ETH Zurich. In 2012 she was elected to AcademiaNet. She joined Georgetown University in 2014, where she is a member of the Department of Physics and Institute for Soft Matter. Her work includes statistical physics and computational theory. She uses modelling and numerical simulations to investigate materials with structural and dynamical complexity; which include amorphous solids, gels and glasses, as well as new green formulations of cements. Gel networks are ubiquitous in nature, and their adaptive and tunable rheological are central to their biological function. Gel networks can be stretched, flow, squeezed or fractured, but a fundamental understanding of such processes is still lacking. Del Gado's group have developed novel theoretical and computational approaches, as well as investigating how the topology of the gel network can determine softening, strain-hardening and brittleness. She has studied how different structural constituents and frozen- in stresses can modify the gel mechanics, and used this understanding to explain experimental observations in a range of materials. Del Gado uses a spatio-temporal analysis of the microscopic dynamics in jammed soft solids. She showed the rate dependent yielding and flow in jammed materials originates from qualitatively different statistical processes. She demonstrated that frozen-in stresses control the emergence and the persistence of flow inhomogeneities. She also showed that gap growth and permeability increase in endothelial monolayers is similar to yielding in jammed soft materials. It originates from plastic processes that require cooperation across several cells and the mismatch in the inter-cellular stress alignment (Stress Orientational Defects) can help predict the loci of gap growth. Cooperative dynamics that emerge during solidification and ageing of soft materials are crucial to their mechanical behavior. To elucidate the role of soft modes, structural heterogeneities and topology, the Del Gado group devised a novel spatio-temporal analysis of these dynamics. They identified the fundamental mechanism governing spatio-temporal correlations and fluctuations in soft solids and at the origin of their ageing. This soft solids include biopolymer networks, microgels, protein gels and even metallic glasses. Del Gado demonstrated that large stress heterogeneities frozen-in during solidification can result in microscopic ruptures and rearrangements, which are due to the elasticity stored in the material structure, which produces intermittent and strongly correlated dynamics. Del Gado has contributed to the new theoretical description of amorphous solids. In particular, she has studied the material properties of concrete and cement. She has worked on more green, sustainable cement. She developed the first quantitative model and computational approach for gelation and densification of cement hydrate gels that form in early stages of cement hydration and are crucial to mechanics and hygro-thermal behavior of cement and concrete. Using Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics Del Gado studied cement formation, finding the early-stage gelation is crucial in attaining its unique strength. Her research has reconciled contrasting experimental findings and set the path to pursue scientifically guided optimisation of cement properties, opening new possibilities for effective novel formulations of green cements. = Academic service = She was appointed the 2017 Provost's Distinguished Associate Professor in recognition of her contributions to excellence and teaching.

A plebiscite will be held in the first quarter of 2021 regarding the proposed dividing of Palawan in the Philippines into three separate provinces: Palawan del Norte, Palawan Oriental, and Palawan del Sur (as per Republic Act No. 11259). Background =Legislative history= Republic Act No. 11259, dividing the Philippine province of Palawan into three separate provinces, was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on April 5, 2019. The act will only take effect if voters in the province vote in favor of the law in a plebiscite scheduled within 2020. =Division of Palawan= Republic Act No. 11259 proposes the division of Palawan into three provinces. The following are the proposed component municipalities of the three provinces: *Palawan del Norte ‚Äì Busuanga, Coron, Culion, El Nido, and Linapacan, with Taytay as its capital *Palawan Oriental ‚Äì Agutaya, Araceli, Cagayancillo, Cuyo, Dumaran, Magsaysay, and San Vicente, with Roxas as its capital *Palawan del Sur ‚Äì Aborlan, Balabac, Bataraza, Sofronio Espa√±ola, Kalayaan, Narra, Quezon, and Rizal, with Brooke's Point as its capital Upon approval of voters, Palawan del Norte and Palawan Oriental would be created from the northern portion of Palawan. Palawan del Sur, designated as the \\"mother province\\", would be the legal successor of the would-be-dissolved Palawan province. The highly-urbanized city of Puerto Princesa, which is not currently under the jurisdiction of the Palawan provincial government and is only statistically and geographically considered part of the province, will continue to be independent of any province. As such, its residents will not participate in the plebiscite; if the division is approved, it would be grouped with the southern province thereafter. However, a petition was filed in Supreme Court, which sought the inclusion of Puerto Princesa residents in the plebiscite. The court unanimously dismissed the petition, ruling that the since Puerto Princesa is a highly-urbanized city and is no longer under the jurisdiction of the province, it cannot be one of the \\"political units directly affected\\" by the plebiscite. Preparation As per law, the plebiscite for the division of Palawan was originally scheduled on \\"the second Monday of May 2020\\" (May 11). However, the plebiscite was suspended on late March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a \\"majority of the votes cast by the voters of the affected areas\\" voted in favor of the law, the Palawan will be split into three provinces: Palawan del Norte, Palawan Oriental and Palawan del Sur. It is unclear what the fate of the proposed partition will be if a majority in one of the proposed three provinces rejected the motion in the plebiscite. There are 490,639 registered voters eligible to participate in the plebiscite. By mid-May Palawan governor Jose Alvarez said that he expects the plebiscite to be done by July, adding that once the general community quarantine is lifted in Palawan, the Commission on Elections will reschedule it. Commissioner Rowena Guanzon hinted that the plebiscite would not take place until the province is no longer locked down. On May 15, Mimaropa, including Palawan and Puerto Princesa, was placed in modified general community quarantine, the lowest form of quarantine available. By July 3, the local COMELEC office is awaiting on a memorandum from the main COMELEC office in Manila on when the plebiscite will take place. The provincial information office earlier said that it expects the plebiscite to be done by August, or at least this year. By July, the commission deferred to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) on scheduling when the plebiscite can be held. The IATF recommended the commission to conduct it with minimum exposure of the voters to the coronavirus, provide additional health safety measures, including the addition of new polling precincts to reduce congestion. The groups campaigning against the division pointed out that activities related to the plebiscite involves mass gatherings, and would be against the guidelines imposed by the government. In October, the task force approved preparations to hold the plebiscite in the first quarter of 2021.

It may be applied to either quantitative or qualitative research. Its general goals are to make the findings from multiple different studies more generalizable and applicable. It aims to generate new knowledge by combining and comparing the results of multiple studies on a given topic. One approach is to use a systematic review method. Techniques Meta-analysis is the preferred technique of quantitative research synthesis in many fields, such as medical science. This technique can sometimes accurately estimate an overall effect, but it may suffer from limitations when there is variation in the included studies with regard to study design, the type of evidence, or other key characteristics. Methods of qualitative research synthesis include narrative synthesis and meta-ethnography. Narrative synthesis allows researchers to address a wide range of questions in their review, while meta-ethnography aims to preserve the cultural context in which the original findings of the included studies were generated. The narrative synthesis approach has attracted criticism because of its potential for bias, with critics highlighting the subjective nature of the use of the method to draw conclusions. There is also evidence that reviews using the narrative synthesis approach often suffer from a lack of transparency.

He was Deputy Treasurer to King James VI.https://scottish-monumental-inscriptions.com/pages/alderman-provests-and- lord-provests-of-the-royal-burgh-and-city-of-edinburgh Life He was born in 1530 the son of William Arnot and his wife, Margaret Wallace. At the Reformation of 1560 the family converted to Protestantism. In August 1574 he submitted a petition to the English ambassador Henry Killigrew who was returning to London. He wanted redress for a cargo of textiles from Flanders. He was tricked by English pirates off Great Yarmouth, led by William Hudson of Colchester, who pretended to be searching for pirates. They stole his own clothes as well as a stock of fabric including velvets, the most costly being a figured black velvet, gold and silver thread, silk thread, gold and silver passementerie, and various silk chamlets and Spanish taffetas. Arnot mentioned that he had talked with Killigrew at Glamis Castle, but was now ill with the Flanders sickness.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 44-6. In 1587 he succeeded William Little as Provost of Edinburgh. When Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell murdered William Stewart of Monkton in July 1588, Arnot's men captured Lord Maxwell who had escaped from Robert Gourlay's house on the High Street.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), p. 586. Arnot and William Fairlie issued a pass for shipwrecked sailors from the Spanish Armada in October 1588. The 46 men had been crew or soldiers of the Ballanzara, (La Trinidad Valencera) wrecked in Ireland. They were to be allowed passage to Spain via Scottish merchant ships going to France.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), pp. 624, 628. On 19 February 1590 James VI wrote from Kronborg in Denmark to the kirk minister Robert Bruce and asked him to ensure the Provost prepared four ships for his return to Scotland, and provided craftsmen for William Schaw to finish repairs to Holyrood Palace. The town council organised a ceremony of welcome for his bride Anne of Denmark on 19 May.David Calderwood, History of the Kirk of Scotland, vol. 5, p. 82. Arnot wrote to the former ambassador from England, William Ashby in April 1590, about the loss of a cargo to pirates some years previously. He wanted to revive his claim for redress and his son-in-law in London planned to make a claim to Queen Elizabeth, and Arnot hoped Ashby could help.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 269. On 26 October 1591 Arnot was appointed to a commission to try, examine, and if required torture people suspected of witchcraft. The others appointees were Sir John Cockburn of Ormiston, David MacGill of Nesbit, Robert Bruce, John Duncanson, and William Litill, then Provost of Edinburgh.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 680. On 29 May 1593 the Privy Council asked Edinburgh council to pay him ¬£10,000 Scots in part repayment of money lent by him by the king, from the town's tax bill.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 88. In 1594 Arnot supplied wine and beer to the ambassadors who had come for the baptism of Prince Henry, advanced money for the royal households, and lent money to the royal mint. James VI gave him a valuable gold cup in security for repayment, and the income from various lands for a few years.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 167-8. English comedians in Edinburgh In April 1598 a group of actors or comedians came to Edinburgh to perform. Arnot made representations to an English diplomat George Nicholson, that the players scorned James VI and the Scottish people and ought to stopped in the case the \\"worst sort\\", the Edinburgh mob, were stirred up to riot.John Duncan Mackie, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1595-1597, 13:1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 188. James VI supported another group of actors, in November 1599, against the church and town authorities who tried to close them down, on religious and moral grounds. This group included Martin Slater and Lawrence Fletcher.Peter Roberts, 'The Business of Playing and the Patronage of Players', Ralph Anthony Houlbrooke, James VI and I: Ideas, Authority, and Government (Ashgate, 2006), pp. 85-6. Later career In 1604 he was appointed Treasurer-depute of Scotland, under the Lord Treasurer, George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar. In 1608 he (or possibly his son) served a second term as Provost, in succession to Alexander Seton.List of Lord Provosts, Edinburgh City Chambers In 1609, during his second term as Provost, he was found innocent of any complicity in the Gowrie plot. At this time it is clear that he acquired some of the lands forfeited by Robert Logan of Restalrig including lands at North Berwick and possibly also Lochend House (which would have served as his Edinburgh residence).https://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=print&id;=12335&filename;=jamesvi_trans&type;=trans He died in 1614 aged 83 (some records state 1616 which would make him 85). At death he left an estate of around ¬£20,000 (around ¬£2 million in modern terms).Louise Yeoman, 'Hunting the rich witch in Scotland', in Julian Goodare, The Scottish Witch Hunt in Context, pp. 112-4. The 1616 death makes more sense in terms of the succession of Lord Provosts as, not until 1616, does William Nisbet of Dean fill the role as the next Lord Provost, yet at age 83/85 Sir John's death could not be described as unexpected. The names \\"John Arnot\\" and \\"James Arnot\\" and \\"John Nesbit\\" appear with others on a poetry manuscript in the Laing collection at the University of Edinburgh and it is thought the manuscript was made for a group of prominent Edinburgh burgesses.Sebastiaan Verweij, The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland (Oxford, 2017), pp. 148-151: EUL Laing III.447. Family He married twice: firstly to Margaret Craig of Riccarton, daughter of Thomas Craig of Riccarton.http://www.thepeerage.com/p66626.htm They had two daughters, Rachel and Marion, following her death in 1615 he married Helen Johnston, and has one further daughter, Helen or Helena Arnot (1568-1650). Helen married Sir George Hume or Home of Manderston.http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I32257&tree;=CC George Home owed Sir John ¬£14,000 but was apparently upset at receiving nothing in his will. The relationship between George and Helen deteriorated to the point that she was accused of witchcraft against him in 1629/1630. Not surprisingly she divorced him in November 1630.Louise Yeoman, 'Hunting the rich witch in Scotland', in Julian Goodare, The Scottish Witch Hunt in Context, pp. 112-4. This was forty years after the North Berwick witch trials. Marion married James Nisbet, son of Henry Nisbet of Dean and brother of William Nisbet of Dean. Marion seems to have inherited Lochend House from her father. James Nisbet was known as James Nisbet of Restalrig after the marriage (Lochend House lies close to the village of Restalrig). His sister Rachel Arnot married the Edinburgh burgess, Archibald Johnston of Warriston, ancestor of the future Lord Provost Sir Patrick Johnston. It is thought that Alexander Home of North Berwick, Provost of Edinburgh from 1593 to 1597, was an in-law or cousin.

Filipowski (1816 ‚Äì 12 June 1872), also known as Tzvi Hirsh Filipowski (, ), was a Lithuanian-born British Jewish Hebraist, editor, mathematician, linguist and actuary. Biography =Early life= Herschell Filipowski was born in Virbalen, Russian Empire (today part of Lithuania) in 1816. He showed great aptitude for the study of mathematics and languages at an early age, and was fortunate in finding a Polish schoolmaster who secretly aided him in acquiring the rudiments of a modern education. Besides his native Yiddish, Filipowski became conversant in Polish, Russian, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese, and at age 15 he published An Almanac for One Hundred Years in both Polish and Russian. In 1839 he emigrated to England, and received an appointments as Teacher of Hebrew and Oriental languages at the Jews' College and the West Metropolitan Jewish School. His first published work was Mo'ed Mo'adim on the Jewish, Karaite, Christian, and Muslim calendars (1846; republished 1863), with tables from the Creation to the year AM 6000. In 1847 he edited a Hebrew annual, Ha-Asif, or Harvest: The Annual Hebrew Magazine, containing various essays on Hebrew literature and mathematics, in both Hebrew and English (1849). The Jewish Chronicle praised Filipowski's calendrical calculations for correcting the defects of Elias H. Lindo's Calendar, especially his erroneous method for calculating the termination of Shabbat in London. According to Filipowski, for almost a decade London Jews had been ending the Shabbat and festivals at the wrong time. Even more serious was the implication that, since the termination of the day affects the time at which the brit milah takes place, users of Lindo's Calendar might have performed that operation on the seventh or ninth day, instead of the eighth day as required by Jewish law. =Actuarial career= Filipowski afterwards was employed as an actuary for the Colonial and Standard Life offices in Edinburgh, a position he kept for about eight years. He later worked as an actuary of the Mercantile, Professional, and General Life and Guarantee Insurance Company, and as an assistant computer at the Royal and Briton companies. In this capacity he published A Table of Anti- Logarithms (1849), which included a testimonial by mathematician Augustus de Morgan and established Filipowski's name among mathematicians. He later published Napier's Canon of Logarithms (1857), a translation of John Napier's Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio from the Latin into English, and in 1864‚Äì66 he edited Francis Baily's Doctrine of Life Annuities and Assurance. The monthly periodical The Actuarial Magazine, devoted to tables of different kinds, was also edited by Filipowski for a short time. Filipowski returned to London in 1860, where he designed a multiplying machine which made use of Slonimski's theorem. The machine's calculating rods include a set of fifty-six wooden cylindrical rods stored in holes in a wooden mahogany case. One of Filipowski's calculating devices survives at the Science Museum, London. =Hebrew publications= Title page to Filipowski's Matzref la-Kesef (1854) In 1851 Filipowski founded a Jewish antiquarian society, ·∏§evrat Me'orerei Yeshenim (a forerunner of the Mekitze Nirdamim), in connection with which he published many important and valuable works in Hebrew. He edited and published for the society translations of Solomon ibn Gabirol's Miv·∏•ar ha-Peninim (1851), Abraham bar ·∏§iyya's Sefer ha-'Ibbur (1851), Azariah dei Rossi's Matzref la-Kesef (1854), Menahem ben Saruk's Ma·∏•beret (1854), Dunash ben Labrat's Teshuvot (1855), and Abraham Zacuto's Sefer Yu·∏•asin ha-Shalem, with notes by Jacob Emden (1857).12px In 1862 he designed a font of Hebrew type with the vowel-points attached to the letters, from which a pocket edition of the Ashkenazi siddur was printed, containing also an English translation by him. In 1867 he founded a short-lived periodical, The Hebrew National, and in 1870 published Biblical Prophecies, on the Jewish position in regard to the Biblical prophecies and the Messiah. A few months before his death in June 1872, Filipowski completed his Hebrew and Roman Almanack from the Year 1 C.E. to Perpetuity. Awards and honours In appreciation of his services to antiquarian research he was elected a fellow of the Antiquarian Society, and for his actuarial work an honorary fellow of the Society of Actuaries.

Early life Hill was born on June 25, 1869 in Paris while his parents, Adams Sherman Hill and Caroline Inches (Dehon) Hill were on vacation. He grew up in Boston and attended Browne & Nichols School, Harvard College, and Harvard Law School. He began practicing law following his graduation in 1894. In 1895 he married Henrietta Post McLean, the daughter of General Nathaniel McLean. They had three children. Early legal career Hill was a partner of the firm Hill, Barlow, Bangs & Homans. In November 1904 he represented the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the \\"Tech riots\\". In 1908 he was appointed receiver for the American Insurance Company. Hill was also an active member of the bar association and specialized in disbarment proceedings against lawyers in Suffolk County. Political career During the 1906 gubernatorial campaign, Hill frequently spoke against the Democratic nominee John B. Moran's record as district attorney. He was the favorite for the Republican nomination for district attorney in 1907, but chose not to enter the race. Moran died in 1909 and Governor Eben Sumner Draper appointed Hill to fill the vacancy. He took office on February 24, 1909. During his tenure as DA, Hill secured the convictions of a former president of the Boston Common Council (Leo F. McCullough), a former Boston Alderman (George H. Battis) and the former head of the city's supply department (Michael J. Mitchell). He was defeated in the 1909 election by Democrat Joseph C. Pelletier. Pelletier kept Hill on as a special counsel on the \\"Steel Cases\\", which involved alleged collusive bidding between the city's structural steel corporations. The trial ended with an acquittal. After leaving office, Hill served as a professor at Harvard Law School. In the 1912 United States presidential election, Hill backed Theodore Roosevelt over William Howard Taft. He joined the Progressive Party and spoke frequently for its 1913 gubernatorial candidate, Charles Sumner Bird. Hill returned to the Republican party in 1915 to stump for gubernatorial nominee Samuel W. McCall.

Location The hotel stands to the north of the (formerly the Place du 7-Novembre 1987) at the eastern end of Avenue Habib Bourguiba, between Avenue Mohammed V and A1 motorway, to the west of the Lake of Tunis. Construction and design It was constructed on 190 reinforced concrete piles up to deep, and built from exposed concrete (b√©ton brut) around a steel structure, creating a single long block with ten floors, with large windows. Projecting cantilevered stairs at each end create an inverted pyramid shape. The 416 bedrooms are mostly on the upper floors, with the top floor twice as long as the ground floor. The interior d√©cor reflected the 1970s, with floors covered by linoleum and a colour palette of brown, orange and red. The striking design, departing from traditional Arab and European architecture, made the hotel a symbol of modernism in Tunis. It remains an important example of Brutalism in North Africa.

Painting of cuirass on the front wall of the antechamber The Tomb of Lyson and Kallikles is an ancient Macedonian tomb of the Hellenistic period in Mieza (modern Lefkadia, near Naousa, Imathia), noted for the quality of its painted decoration. The tomb was originally built for the brothers Lyson and Kallikles, sons of Aristophanes, around 250 BC and it continued to be used by their descendants for around a century, going out of use around time of Roman conquest. Description The tomb consists of two vaulted chambers, an antechamber and a burial chamber on a north-south axis, entered from the south, and covered over by an earthen tumulus. The antechamber is 0.89 m wide and 0.86 m long. The walls are painted with pilasters, decked with garlands, support an architrave with guttae. This 'architectural style' of the wall paintings may be the earliest surviving example of \\"perspective\\" and is seen by Stella G. Miller as a precursor of the Pompeian second style. There is a painting of a perirrhanterion (a water sprinkler used for ritual purification) on the left side wall and an altar with a serpent on the right side wall. The most noted paintings from the tomb are the depictions of weapons and armour in the semicircular areas above the doorways on the rear and front walls, which presumably emphasise Lyson and Kallikles' position as members of the Macedonian military aristocracy. The rear wall depicts a Macedonian shield with the Vergina Sun surrounded by a wreath. Below the shield, there are two greaves, a Phrygian helmet at left and an Attic helmet at right. The whole design is flanked by two swords depicted as if hanging from nails in the roof. The painting in the front wall is similar, but the shield has a different design - a central circle surrounded by a ring of dots and eight smaller circles, each containing three dots and separated from the neighbouring circles by small thunderbolts. This shield design is common on the coinage of the Antigonid kings of Macedon. The shield is flanked by two cuirasses (with helmets) and two swords hanging from nails. The burial chamber is 3.05 m wide, 3.95 m long, and 1.95 m high. As in the antechamber, the walls are painted with pillars, supporting an architrave with guttae. Between the painted pillars, there are twenty-two niches for the remains of the dead, arranged in two rows (six in the back wall and four on each of the side walls). Only seventeen of these were ever used. Garlands with ribbons are painted above the niches, as well as the names of the dead, starting with Lyson and Kallikles, and continuing with their descendants for four generations. This is the only Macedonian tomb where the names of the occupants are preserved. The tomb was discovered in 1942 and excavated by Charalambos Makaronas. A full-length study was produced by Stella G. Miller in 1993. A metal protective structure was built over the tomb in 1999. It is not accessible to the public.

In 1935 he married his former student, Ella Bartler, who later became a fabric collage artist. He changed his name to Raayoni around that period. In 1939, at the same time he was teaching, Raayoni started to study architecture an engineering at the British Institute for Engineering Technology. Raayoni received his degree in Architecture and Engineering in 1945. He joined the General Union of Painters and Sculptors in Palestine in 1947, and immediately thereafter traveled, for the first time, to Paris.

He was also experimenting with a derivative of Action Painting, a painting technique introduced by the American painter Jackson Pollock. In this technique, an image is created by body movements without rational control. In the 70's and 80's came his ‚Äúwhite period‚Äù. Raayoni created a series of scenery painting based on the landscapes of the Negev.Museum Dada in Ein-Hod showed a large exhibition of these paintings in 1990. The‚Äù White Period is mentioned in Gili Dinstein-Yashpeh article about Raayoni, ‚ÄúThe Last Bohemian,‚Äù Maariv, August 15, 1990 pp. 21. In many of these paintings clusters of figures appear, serving as metaphor to the emotional world he wanted to represent. In later years his paintings were based on his impressions from his visit to the city of Goslar, Germany. In his late life he focused on painting figures. Raayoni's body of work shifts between a variety of styles and techniques. Initially, as Batia Donner mentioned in her article about Raayoni, \\"it seemed to chart an evolutionary process that echoes cultural phenomena and trends that occurred at the heart of the Israeli art scene. However, at a certain moment, his paintings began to flit stylistically back and forth along the time axis, as he tried to identify the precise gesture that may best fit the meaning he sought to express\\"Donner, Batia, \\"Shmuel Raayoni: Between History and Style\\", Catalogue, Shmuel Raayoni: Israeli Painter, City Gallery Kfar Saba, 2018 Pg. 44-45  Awards and prizes  * 1948 - Herman Struck Award, Haifa Municipality * 1958 - Malach Prize for print * 1947 - First solo exhibition in Haifa * 1949, 1953, 1955 - Artists House Haifa * 1956, 1958 - Ein-Hod Art Gallery * 1957 - Chagall House Haifa * 1958 - Artists House Jerusalem * 1958 - Marcel Bernheim Gallery Paris * 1961 - Gallery 220 and Yehudit Gallery * 1962 ‚Äì El Paso Art Museum, Texas USA * 1965 ‚Äì Contemporary Art Museum Haifa * 1965 - Woodstock Gallery London Great Britain * 1965 - Jewish Community Center, Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA (together with his wife, Ella Raayoni) * 1966, 1969, 1975,1979 - Nora Gallery Jerusalem * 1967 ‚Äì Yad Labanim Rechovot (together with his wife, Ella Raayoni) * 1967 ‚Äì Beit Haam Beer Sheva (together with his wife, Ella Raayoni) * 1968 ‚Äì Batte Wage Gallery Bazel, Switzerland * 1969 - People in the Landscape, Aquarelle * 1969 - 1977 Exhibitions in the US and Canada * 1977 - Jewish Museum, Berkeley, California, USA * 1980 - Yares Gallery Scottsdale, Arizona, USA (together with his wife, Ella Raayoni) * 1983 - Chagall House, Association of Painters & Sculptors in Haifa * 1984 - Portraits in Aquarelle, Nora Gallery Jerusalem * 1990 - Human Faces, Ein-Hod Artist House * 1992 - Flip it up flip it down, The Janco-dada Museum in Ein- Hod (together with his wife, Ella Raayoni) * 1994, 2017 - Ein-Hod Art Gallery * 2019 - Kfar Saba Municipal Gallery  Biennial and group exhibitions  *1953 - Biennial in S√£o Paulo, Brazil *1958 - Autumn Salon, Paris France *1978 - Paintings from Israel, Artist Association House Paderborn, Germany *1987 - Israeli Art from Ein-Hod and Tel-Aviv, The Electorate of Trier, Germany  Additional reading  * Ballas,Gila, New Horizons: The Birth of Abstraction in Israeli Art (Papyrus Publishing, Tel Aviv 1980, additional extended Edition: Modan Publishing, Ben Shemen 2014) ( Avniel,M., Hoenich, P.K. and Pomrok, M.B, Fifty Artists, Masada Press Ltd.
