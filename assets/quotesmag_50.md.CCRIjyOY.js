It is one of the few remaining 'Camp schools' built by the National Camps Corporation in 1939 to provide fresh air and fun activities for inner city children and offer a refuge for civilian evacuees in the event of war breaking out. The first occupants of the Centre were children from Catford Central and Browhill schools in East London who arrived in May 1940, as the construction work was being completed. The boys, supplemented from other schools as World War II continued, lived at the Centre throughout the war. After the war, the Centre was used to rehabilitate Dutch children following the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Sayers Croft began taking groups of children from London on residential visits. The National Camps Corporation was not a success, its assets were subsequently transferred to local authorities. The Centre transferred to the Greater London Council, and was run until 1990 by the Inner London Education Authority. Ownership was later transferred to Westminster City Council, who still run the Centre. In 1996, The Sayers Croft TrustSayers Croft Trust web site was established as an independent charity with the aim of involving the local community, especially young people, in the enjoyment and care of the environment. By working in partnership with the Sayers Croft field centre, the Trust aims to make all the facilities of Sayers Croft available to those who may otherwise be unable to access them due to physical, financial or social disadvantage. Sayer's Croft nature reserve on land owned by the Centre is a Local Nature Reserve. Over half a million people have visited Sayers Croft. The Centre hosts 12,000 visitors annually, from a variety of sources. There is a day visit programme for local schools and a community programme that targets disadvantaged young people. Sayers Croft provides a wide range of opportunities for first hand outdoor learning in a safe environment. History =Early History= Sayers Croft is situated on Wealden clay, to the South of the Greensand Ridge. The area is not suitable for agriculture, and so has remained heavily wooded. The Romans built Stane street across the Weald to link Chichester (Noviomagus Reginorum) on the South coast with London and a branch from this principal highway crosses Sayers Croft on its way to the Romano-Celtic temple at Farley Green. The earliest historical reference to Sayers Croft is in an indenture dated 20 August 1552, which records the sale by Sir Edward Bray, knight, to John Dandy, cowman of Sayers Croft, 3 acres of land for the sum of ¬£8. This document mentions Parsons Wood and also the 'poor field' which is located on the North West Boundary of Sayers Croft Centre and which was purchased and incorporated into the Sayers Croft Local Nature Reserve in 2003. A croft is a small building or small holding and it is likely that the word Sayers is derived from 'Sawyer' a man who cut wood =The Camps Act 1939= The bombing of the Basque town of Guernica in Spain by planes of the German Luftwaffe's Condor Legion in 1937 made politicians realise the potential for destruction in British cities should another war with Germany break out in Europe. As tensions continued to grow, a bill was presented to the British parliament in March 1939 to promote and facilitate the construction, maintenance and management of camps of a permanent character\\". The Bill provided funds for compulsory land purchase and an exemption form Planning restrictions. The camps were to be constructed and administered by the National Camps Corporation, a non-profit making body set up under the Act. A Government letter in 1939 states \\"I am directed by the Minister of Health to refer to the permanent camps now being erected in England and Wales under the provisions of the Camps Act and to say that he has under consideration the question of whether they should be marked in some distinctive manner to indicate that they are civilian camps, so as to avoid bombing by hostile aircraft in the event of war. In peacetime it is the intention to use these camps as school camps but in time of war they should provide accommodation for some of the civil population evacuated from urban areas\\" The Camps were to be in quiet attractive, wooded country, so that they would be less obvious from the air, and were not to be built near military or naval establishments, aerodromes or main railway lines. Access was to be good and it would be advantageous to be near a town or village to facilitate catering. Less than three months after the Camps Bill, on 19 June, work started on the first camp at Overton in Hampshire. It was scheduled to be finished on 31 August but was eventually completed in October. Construction at nineteen other sites began and in reply to a House of Commons question on Tuesday 3 October it was stated \\"construction is in hand\\". All of the Camps were to be built from Canadian Cedarwood to standard plans and specification. The architects used were Messrs. Sir John Burnet, Tait and Larne of Montagu place, London. The actual designs were made by the modernist architect Thomas S Tait. Each Camp was to accommodate \\"348 children in six dormitories, together with a hall, a very large dining room with kitchens attached, 4 classrooms, a hospital block for 7 patients and quarters for camp staff, the camp superintendent, and the Headmaster\\". The total cost of building Sayers Croft was ¬£25,968 comprising construction ¬£14,111, services ¬£8,292, site purchase ¬£1,500, legal fees ¬£15, equipment ¬£1,750 and architects fees of ¬£300.

Biography He became interested in art history during the period of studying at the Virginia Military Institute, where he considered a career as a stained-glass craftsman. In 1972, he received his Ph.D. in the history of art from Johns Hopkins University, where he got a full scholarship. After he finished university, he started working for the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn. There he was a curator of a series of small shows, which were focused on new art and new ideas. Later he got a job at the St. Louis Art Museum, where he was in charge of a show of Matisse cutouts, \\"Expressions: New Art From Germany\\", the first survey of German neoexpressionist painting. Then Cowart took over the position of head of the department of 20th-century art at the National Gallery of Art (1983-1992), where he helped Herb and Dorothy Vogel find a home for their collection, supervised the transfer humorously portrayed in the film Herb and Dorothy, and laid the groundwork for their donation of 50 works each to 50 states.

Its benefice is united with those of St Olaf, Wasdale Head, and St Michael, Nether Wasdale. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is associated with \\"a unique Viking-age assemblage\\" of carved stones. History This has been a Christian site since the 8th century. The oldest fabric in the present church dates from the 12th century. The church was reconstructed in 1789, but most of the fabric currently present is the result of a virtual rebuilding by C. J. Ferguson between 1896 and 1899. Architecture St Mary's is constructed in stone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave, a north aisle, a south porch, a chancel and north vestries. The 19th-century rebuilding is in Decorated style. At the west end is a corbelled-out bellcote. The gabled porch leads to the south door, to the right of which is a blocked Norman doorway, formerly on the north side of the church. There is a monument dated 1834 on the exterior of the north wall of the chancel. Inside the church is a four-bay north arcade, consisting of pointed arches carried on columns with octagonal capitals. The 14th-century chancel arch is set on richly carved Norman capitals. In a niche at the east end of the aisle are two carved Viking hogback stones. These are very rare pre-Norman tomb markers that were found under the foundations of a 12th- century wall of the church during restoration in 1896-97. The early 11th century is the latest possible date.C A Parker, The Gosforth District, 1904 The hogbacks are each in the shape of a house. The larger tomb has on its sides humans astride smaller serpents battling with larger serpents. The smaller stone has two armies thought to be concluding a truce. In and around the niche, and in the porch are other fragments of medieval stones. The small octagonal font dates from the 19th century. Also in the church is a Chinese bell dating from 1839, which was captured from the Anunghoy Fort in the Battle of the Bogue (1841) on the Canton River. It was donated to the church in 1844. One of the stone slabs is the so-called \\"Gosforth fishing stone\\" and is presumably the same artist who carved the cross, outside. It represents Thor and the giant Hymir, fishing for J√∂rmungandr, the serpent which encircles the world. It is possibly a remnant of another cross. The stained glass dates mainly from the late 19th century, most of which is by Ward and Hughes. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Conacher and Company of Huddersfield, and rebuilt and expanded in 1984 by Sixsmith. External features The most important feature in the churchyard is a Viking stone cross dating from the early part of the 10th century. It is a sandstone structure standing high, and is elaborately carved with human figures and beasts, mainly depicting scenes from Scandinavian mythology. This is the tallest Viking cross in the country. It is designated as a scheduled monument. Another cross of similar age has been cut down to form a sundial. In the northeast corner of the churchyard is a hut or shed that has been constructed from left-over stones, including 13th- century grave-covers, pieces of stone carved with zigzags, and a corbel. The structure is listed at Grade II. Also in the churchyard are three tombstones bearing dates between 1711 and 1729, each of which has been listed at Grade II.

It was built by James Cunningham, Son and Company of Rochester, New York, and during testing demarcated as the Model T4. History Two T4 were built to Ordnance specifications by Cunningham Motors, Rochester, New York. Subsequent ones were built by Rock Island ArsenalIcks Two T4 rest vehicles were built in 1931 and tested until 1934, when they were standardized as the M1. Some sources indicate an additional ten T4s may have been built before standardization- Army records list only 12 M1 cars being accepted, though it is unclear if these are all new built vehicles or if the number includes the ones originally built as T4s. If the records refer to two different orders, the maximum number built for each type is still only twelve T4 and twelve M1. All vehicles of both designations are believed to have been issued to the First Cavalry Regiment for testing and trials. They are all believed to have been removed from service prior to 1939. It was powered by an 8-cylinder gasoline engine, sported a crew of four and was armed with a maximum of one .50 machine gun permanently mounted in the turret and two 'backup' .30 machine guns mounted in fore and aft firing ports. The turret also had fittings for mounting one of the machine guns for anti-aircraft use, though this was never tested by the Army. It could hit a speed of 55 mph on paved surfaces, and had an estimated cruising range on roads of approximately 250 miles. While it actually has six wheels (eight if you count the semi-usable spares behind the front axle), it is listed as a 4WD vehicle- the two rear axles are powered, while the front axle is only used for steering. This is different from many US Military combat vehicles which came later, most of which were all-wheel drive (4x4 or 6x6). Though it had respectable (for the 1930s) performance on paved and improved surfaces, the lack of powered front wheels and its length combined to give it very poor off-road performance, especially in mud and snow. The spare wheels were mounted on free-spinning 'stub axles' in an effort to keep it from bottoming out the chassis, but they did nothing to help it get unstuck. Although the vehicle itself was not adopted for mass production, it showed enough benefits over continued use of the horse to warrant further study and experimentation at mechanizing the U.S. Cavalry through the rest of the 1930s and into the early 1940s. Lessons learned in its trials also led to the design and adoption of more successful Armored Cars, such as the T17 Staghound and M8 Greyhound. The lessons learned about its cross country performance were a factor in the eventual adoption of light tanks and half-tracks for many mechanized cavalry and recon units in the early 1940s.

Following calls for Komnas HAM to inquire into the 1984 Tanjung Priok massacre, the Human Rights Law of 2000 (No. 26) gave it the power to investigate alleged human rights abuses, if necessary by forming ad hoc investigative teams bringing in outside expertise. It issued two reports on the 1984 killings. In 2008, it reopened an investigation into the 1998 Trisakti shootings in which four students were shot dead by state security forces. In 2008, Law No. 40 gave Komnas HAM additional responsibilities in the prevention of racial and ethnic discrimination. In all of its work, Komnas HAM is required to have regard to human rights defined in national legislation and in international instruments to which Indonesia is party.Komnas HAM website, statutes page International status In 2000, with support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Komnas HAM secured 'A-status' accreditation from the peer review process of the International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs (ICC), giving it enhanced access to the United Nations human rights bodies.

For instance, starting in the 1990s a series of criminal cases in Ireland and Irish government enquiries covered allegations that priests had abused hundreds of minors over previous decades. State-ordered investigations documented \\"tens of thousands of children from the 1940s to the 1990s\\" who suffered abuse at the hands of priests, nuns and church staff in three diocese. However, sex abuse cases of adults and cases of non-sexual abuse have also been reported. On February 5, 2019, Pope Francis acknowledged that nuns had been sexually abused by Catholic priests and bishops, citing as an example the closure of an order by his predecessor 'because this slavery of women had entered it -- slavery, even to the point of sexual slavery'. Abuse cases by country The Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Europe has affected several dioceses in European nations, although not to the same extent as it has affected dioceses in the United States of America. After the United States, the country with the next highest number of reported cases is Ireland. A significant number of cases have also been reported in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. In 2001, lawsuits were filed in the United States and Ireland, alleging that some priests had sexually abused minors and that their superiors had conspired to conceal and otherwise abet their criminal misconduct.Bruni, p. 336. In 2004, the John Jay report tabulated a total of 4,392 priests and deacons in the U.S. against whom allegations of sexual abuse had been made. = Prevalence = In a statement read out by Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi in September 2009, the Holy See stated \\"We know now that in the last 50 years somewhere between 1.5% and 5% of the Catholic clergy has been involved in sexual abuse cases\\", adding that this figure was comparable with that of other groups and denominations.http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/ondemand/conferences/unhrc/twelfth/hrc090922pm2-eng.rm?start=01:28:49&end;=01:31:56 Webcast A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse by Dr. Thomas Plante of Santa Clara University and volunteer clinical associate professor at Stanford University states that \\"approximately 4% of priests during the past half century (and mostly in the 1960s and 1970s) have had a sexual experience with a minor\\" which \\"is consistent with male clergy from other religious traditions and is significantly lower than the general adult male population which may double these numbers\\".Plante, Thomas: A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse, San Jose Mercury News, March 24, 2002 (updated online version) Additionally, according to Newsweek magazine, the figure in the Catholic Church is similar to that in the rest of the adult population.  Child sex abuse cases  There have been a series of convictions, trials and ongoing investigations into allegations of sex crimes committed by Catholic priests and active members of Roman Catholic orders against children as young as 3 years old with the majority between the ages of 10 and 16. There have been criminal prosecutions of the abusers and civil lawsuits against the church's dioceses and parishes. In addition to cases of sodomy, oral penetration, and lewd and sexual acts against a minor, cases have been brought forth against members of the Catholic hierarchy who did not report abuse allegations to the civil authorities. In many cases they deliberately moved sexually abusive priests to other locations where the clergy continued their acts of sexual aggression towards minors.Bruni, p.336 ‚Äì this has led to a number of fraud cases in the United States, where the Church has been accused of misleading victims by deliberately relocating priests accused of abuse instead of removing them from their positions. In defending their actions, some bishops and psychiatrists contended that the prevailing psychology decades ago suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling. This is opposed by the finding that Gerald Fitzgerald, \\"the founder of a religious order that treats Roman Catholic priests who molest children concluded in the 1950s that offenders were unlikely to change and should not be returned to ministry,\\" and this was discussed with Pope Paul VI (1897 ‚Äì 1978) and \\"in correspondence with several bishops.\\" Sexual abuse of children under the age of consent by priests receives significant media and public attention in Canada, Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Belgium, France, and Germany, while cases have been reported throughout the world. Many of the cases span several decades and are brought forward years after the abuse occurred. In response to this attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive. = Lawsuits = BishopAccountability.org, an \\"online archive established by lay Catholics,\\" reports that over 3,000 \\"civil lawsuits have been filed against the church\\" in the United States, some of these cases have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements with many claimants. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas paid $30.9 million in 1998 to twelve victims of one priest ($ in present-day terms). In July 2003 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville paid $25.7 million to \\"settle child sexual- abuse allegations made in 240 lawsuits naming 34 priests and other church workers.\\" In 2003 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston also settled a large case for $85 million with 552 alleged victims. In 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange settled nearly 90 cases for $100 million. In April 2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon agreed to a $75 million settlement with 177 claimants and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle agreed to a $48 million settlement with more than 160 victims. In July 2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles reached a $660 million agreement with more than 500 alleged victims, in December 2006, the archdiocese had a settlement of 45 lawsuits for $60 million. In September 2007 the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego reached a $198.1 million \\"agreement with 144 childhood sexual abuse victims.\\" In July 2008 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver agreed \\"to pay $5.5 million to settle 18 claims of childhood sexual abuse.\\" The Associate Press estimated the total from settlements of sex abuse cases from 1950-2007 to be more than $2 billion. According to BishopAccountability reports that figure reached more than $3 billion in 2012. Addressing \\"a flood of abuse claims\\" five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon.; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection.

Abuse by members of Roman Catholic orders Distinct from abuse by parish priests, who are subject to diocesan control, there has also been abuse by members of Roman Catholic orders, which often care for the sick or teach at school. Just as diocesan clergy have arranged parish transfers of abusive priests, so leaders of Catholic orders have relocated abusive Brothers to other chapters of their order. As early as 1900, allegations of cruelty and the sexual abuse of children surrounding Stoke Industrial School, (also known as St Mary's Orphanage) instigated a New Zealand Royal Commission and the eventual prosecution of two Marist Brothers. In response the Church published its \\"Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders\\" in 2005. Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ireland) The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA) is one of a range of measures introduced by the Irish Government to investigate the extent and effects of abuse on children from 1936 onwards. It is commonly known in Ireland as the Ryan Commission (previously \\"the Laffoy Commission\\"), after its chair, Justice Se√°n Ryan. Judge Laffoy resigned on 2 September 2003, following a departmental review on costs and resources. She felt that: \\"...the cumulative effect of those factors effectively negated the guarantee of independence conferred on the Commission and militated against it being able to perform its statutory functions.\\" The Commission's work started in 1999 and it published its public report, commonly referred to as the Ryan report, on 20 May 2009. The Commission's remit was to investigate all forms of child abuse in Irish institutions for children; the majority of allegations it investigated related to the system of sixty residential \\"Reformatory and Industrial Schools\\" operated by Catholic Church orders, funded and supervised by the Irish Department of Education. The Commission's report said testimony had demonstrated beyond a doubt that the entire system treated children more like prison inmates and slaves than people with legal rights and human potential, that some religious officials encouraged ritual beatings and consistently shielded their orders amid a \\"culture of self-serving secrecy\\", and that government inspectors failed to stop the abuses. Among the more extreme allegations of abuse were beatings and rapes, subjection to naked beatings in public, being forced into oral sex and even subjection to beatings after failed rape attempts by brothers. The abuse has been described by some as Ireland's Holocaust. The abuse was said to be \\"endemic\\" in the institutions that dealt with boys. The UK based Guardian newspaper, described the abuse as \\"the stuff of nightmares\\", citing the adjectives used in the report as being particularly chilling: \\"systemic, pervasive, chronic, excessive, arbitrary, endemic\\". The Report's conclusions section (Chapter 6) supports the overall tenor of the accusations without exception. However, the Commission's recommendations were restricted in scope by two rules imposed by the Irish government, and therefore do not include calls for the prosecution or sanction of any of the parties involved.

James Cunningham, Son and Company was an American business based in Rochester, New York, initially manufacturing horse-drawn coaches, that from 1908 onward developed and produced automobiles. The Cunningham company was a pioneer in automobile production, credited with being one of the world's first developers and manufacturers of automobiles and, in 1916, one of the first carmakers to produce an American V8 engine automobile. Its Cunningham automobile was a pioneering American production automobile. History The firm dates to 1838, when James Cunningham joined the carriage firm Kerr, Cunningham, and Company. Incorporated in 1882, and taken over after James' death in 1886 by his son Joseph, the company made fine carriages and sleighs, and became a leading manufacturer of these vehicles before the turn of the century. Cunningham went on to manufacture automobiles, car bodies (mainly hearses), chassis frames for other marques, and aircraft. Today, it is mainly remembered for high-quality luxury automobiles. Cunningham‚Äôs emphasis was on quality vehicles of luxury, elegance, and high style. Its products were sometimes innovative, often unique, and in most cases expensive. When it made automobiles, its strategy was to build a car equal to, or better than, the best from Europe. Cunningham ceased producing automobiles in 1931 but continued to make bodies for other car manufactures until 1936, when the company went out of business.  Car production In 1896 the company produced electric-powered buggies, primarily for purposes of experimentation during an era when such electric-powered vehicles were slow, and when vehicles powered by steam required the operator to be certified and licensed. Foreseeing the necessity to switch to the production of horseless carriages, Cunningham started automobile production in 1908 with gasoline engine cars that sold at approximately $3,500, a very high price at the time. Initially the company made only the chassis. They assembled each car to individual customer requirements, using components from other manufacturers. Engines came from Buffalo or Continental. Cunningham also sold electric cars based on their experimental vehicle from the 1890s. By 1910, the company was producing all its parts and selling its cars in the range of $4,500 to $5,000. From 1911 Cunningham offered complete automobiles that were illustrated in its first catalogue. They were hand-built and production was slow: one and a half cars per worker per year from a workforce of 450. Much of the wood- and metal-work was crafted by hand. Aviation production In 1928 Cunningham began aircraft production as Cunningham-Hall Aircraft Corporation. As with automobile production, its engineers were innovative and they produced a bi-wing plane in 1929 that had a very low landing speed of 39 mph. Cunningham-Hall continued to 1948. Other production James Cunningham, Son and Company developed the M1 Armored Car (T24), tested by the Ordnance Department in 1931. The company made high-speed, very-long-life crossbar switches with physically small mechanical parts which permitted faster operation than telephone-type crossbar switches.

Between 1454 and 1460 he worked in Hesdin where he produced 55 thumbnails for La Fleur des Histoires by Jean Mansel, commissioned by Philip the Good of the House of Valois-Burgundy.

He also did some work for Charles the Bold. In his early work, he was influenced by Simon Marmion. After 1467 he was found in Bruges, where he was a member of the Guild of Saint Luke listed as an illuminator. In all probability he continued to work in Bruges until 1479. Li√©det was long thought to have died around 1479, the date of the last mention of him in the archives of Bruges. However recent research by Dominique Vanwijnsberghe in the archives of Lille shows that Li√©det and his brother Huchon (or Husson) were still listed in the archives of that city in 1483 and 1484.

The algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory. In 2016, the scrypt algorithm was published by IETF as RFC 7914. A simplified version of scrypt is used as a proof-of-work scheme by a number of cryptocurrencies, first implemented by an anonymous programmer called ArtForz in Tenebrix and followed by Fairbrix and Litecoin soon after.  Introduction  A password-based key derivation function (password-based KDF) is generally designed to be computationally intensive, so that it takes a relatively long time to compute (say on the order of several hundred milliseconds). Legitimate users only need to perform the function once per operation (e.g., authentication), and so the time required is negligible. However, a brute-force attack would likely need to perform the operation billions of times, at which point the time requirements become significant and, ideally, prohibitive. Previous password-based KDFs (such as the popular PBKDF2 from RSA Laboratories) have relatively low resource demands, meaning they do not require elaborate hardware or very much memory to perform. They are therefore easily and cheaply implemented in hardware (for instance on an ASIC or even an FPGA). This allows an attacker with sufficient resources to launch a large-scale parallel attack by building hundreds or even thousands of implementations of the algorithm in hardware and having each search a different subset of the key space. This divides the amount of time needed to complete a brute-force attack by the number of implementations available, very possibly bringing it down to a reasonable time frame. The scrypt function is designed to hinder such attempts by raising the resource demands of the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm is designed to use a large amount of memory compared to other password-based KDFs,Stronger Key Derivation Via Sequential Memory-Hard Functions, Colin Percival making the size and the cost of a hardware implementation much more expensive, and therefore limiting the amount of parallelism an attacker can use, for a given amount of financial resources.  Overview  The large memory requirements of scrypt come from a large vector of pseudorandom bit strings that are generated as part of the algorithm. Once the vector is generated, the elements of it are accessed in a pseudo-random order and combined to produce the derived key. A straightforward implementation would need to keep the entire vector in RAM so that it can be accessed as needed. Because the elements of the vector are generated algorithmically, each element could be generated on the fly as needed, only storing one element in memory at a time and therefore cutting the memory requirements significantly. However, the generation of each element is intended to be computationally expensive, and the elements are expected to be accessed many times throughout the execution of the function. Thus there is a significant trade-off in speed in order to get rid of the large memory requirements. This sort of time‚Äìmemory trade-off often exists in computer algorithms: speed can be increased at the cost of using more memory, or memory requirements decreased at the cost of performing more operations and taking longer. The idea behind scrypt is to deliberately make this trade-off costly in either direction. Thus an attacker could use an implementation that doesn't require many resources (and can therefore be massively parallelized with limited expense) but runs very slowly, or use an implementation that runs more quickly but has very large memory requirements and is therefore more expensive to parallelize.  Algorithm  The algorithm includes the following parameters: * Passphrase - The string of characters to be hashed. * Salt - A string of characters that modifies the hash to protect against Rainbow table attacks * N - CPU/memory cost parameter. * p - Parallelization parameter; a positive integer satisfying p ‚â§ (232‚àí 1) * hLen / MFLen. * dkLen - Intended output length in octets of the derived key; a positive integer satisfying dkLen ‚â§ (232‚àí 1) * hLen. * r - The blocksize parameter, which fine-tunes sequential memory read size and performance. 8 is commonly used. * hLen - The length in octets of the hash function (32 for SHA256). * MFlen - The length in octets of the output of the mixing function (SMix below). Defined as r * 128 in RFC7914. Function scrypt Inputs: Passphrase: Bytes string of characters to be hashed Salt: Bytes random salt CostFactor (N): Integer CPU/memory cost parameter - Must be a power of 2 (e.g. 1024) BlockSizeFactor (r): Integer blocksize parameter (8 is commonly used) ParallelizationFactor (p): Integer Parallelization parameter.

Cryptocurrency uses  Scrypt is used in many cryptocurrencies as a proof-of-work algorithm. It was first implemented for Tenebrix (released in September 2011) and served as the basis for Litecoin and Dogecoin, which also adopted its scrypt algorithm. Mining of cryptocurrencies that use scrypt is often performed on graphics processing units (GPUs) since GPUs tend to have significantly more processing power (for some algorithms) compared to the CPU. This led to shortages of high end GPUs due to the rising price of these currencies in the months of November and December 2013. As of May 2014, specialized ASIC mining hardware is available for scrypt-based cryptocurrencies.

History The song may have appeared as early as 1604 when the first permanent French settlement was established in the maritimes. As with all traditional songs, numerous versions of both music and lyrics can be found, and versions known in France and Belgium vary from those known in Canada. Musicality The melody is pentatonic, and uses only four notes of the scale. The verse employs an alternating 7- and 6-syllable, with the refrain adding an extra syllable to each line. Meaning Like another famous children's song, \\"Au clair de la lune\\", it has an adult theme - in this case, one of lost love. The song speaks of a lover bathing in a fountain, hearing a nightingale singing, and thinking about her long lost lover whom she lost after failing to give her rosebud. The nightingale's heart laughs but hers weeps. The rosebud is a euphemism for maidenhood, and thus she wishes it were still intact and could still be given to her long lost lover. The refrain is repeated at the end of each verse: :\\"Il y a longtemps que je t'aime, Jamais je ne t'oublierai.\\" :\\"I've loved you for a long time, I will never forget you.\\" The song also has a hidden political meaning of resistance against British invasion of Quebec, and it was sung by the Qu√©b√©cois as a sign of resistance: the Rose representing the British, the clear fountain representing the Saint Laurent River, and the sentence \\"I've loved you for a long time, I will never forget you\\" is intended for France and the French land of Quebec. (Or so it is commonly said, but it is not clear how the rose can both represent the British and be something the Qu√©b√©cois refused to give to France, thereby losing its love.) Complete lyrics The lyrics are: {  style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\" As I was walking by the clear fountain, I found the water so lovely I had to bathe. (refrain) I've loved you for so long, I will never forget you Under the oak's leaves, I lay and dried. On the highest bough, a nightingale sang. (refrain) Sing, nightingale, sing, you who has a joyous heart. Your heart is made for laughing... mine can only cry. (refrain) I lost my love without deserving it, Because of a bouquet of roses I refused him... (refrain) I wish the rose were still on the bush, And my sweetheart loved me still. } Modern usage The song can be heard at the end of the 2006 film \\"The Painted Veil\\", sung by a children's choir. It inspired the title of the 2008 French film Il y a longtemps que je t'aime and appears as a recurring theme. It has been performed by (among others) Dame Emma Albani, Nana Mouskouri, and Kate & Anna McGarrigle, who regularly used it as an encore in their live performances and released such a recording on their compilation album ODDiTTiES. It has been adapted and arranged, notably a choral arrangement by the French composer Jean Langlais, and a jazz version by the English arranger Bob Chilcott. Sung by Henri (Andrew Moodie), Thomas Durant's butler, in \\"Jamais Je Ne T'oublierai - Episode 4\\", Season 1 of AMC's Hell On Wheels. Michael Tippett inscribed his String Quartet No. 5 (1990-1) with a verse from the folk song.Michael Tippett, String Quartet No. 5 (London: Schott & Co. Ltd, 1992) ED 12400. It lends the quartet a symbolic significance and adds a strong conceptual dimension to the composition. In a poignant moment at the end of the French film Things to Come (L'Avenir) by Mia Hansen-L√∏ve, 2016, the character Nathalie, played by Isabelle Huppert, sings the song to her granddaughter to comfort her. Before being approached by a bounty hunter, Rivard can be seen humming the tune in the first episode of Season 2 Frontier (Netflix). During the Netflix documentary film Icarus, that tells the story of the Russian athletics doping scandal, a rendition of the song sung by artist Genevoise is used to illustrate the heartache felt by Grigory Rodchenkov after he says goodbye to his wife and prepares to enter the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. In Louis Malle's 1987 film Au Revoir Les Enfants, on their way to the public baths, the main character's group sings the song. In Sid Meier's Civilization VI, the song is used as an ambient theme for the Canadian civilization in the expansion pack, Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm. A version of the song is used in Episode 4 of the Netflix Docuseries, The Devil Next Door. An excerpt of the song is used in Season 3 Ep. 8 of the Netflix show, Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments.

The Polish forces were led by Field Crown Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski while the Swedes were led by Johann Streiff, Maximilian Teuffel and Johann Friedrich von K√∂tteritz. The battle ended with a Swedish surrender mainly due to low morale of the German mercenaries in Swedish service. These troops started a mutiny and negotiated with the Polish command without Streiff's knowledge and prepared to switch sides to join the Polish army. Being unable to trust their mercenaries the Swedish troops were forced to surrender. Background In January 1627 Axel Oxenstierna developed a plan to destroy the Polish forces by flanking them from east and west. The western component was to come from new recruits in Germany; their recruitment however was significantly delayed, and eventually ordered by Gustavus II Adolphus to march for Poland before they reached the planned strength of 5,000. They numbered about 1,000 reiter cavalry, 1,500 infantry and eight artillery pieces. Initially this put Polish forces under Field Crown Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski in a difficult position, but eventually the German mercenary forces under Johann Streiff (commanding the cavalry) and Maximilian Teuffel were however separated from the main Swedish forces on March 20, surprised by the flooding of the Vistula which made crossing the river impossible in most places. They considered retreating to Puck but Koniecpolski with 3,000 troops besieged it and the Swedes surrendered on April 2 before Streiff and Teuffel could arrive. Streiff and Teuffel decided to move towards Gniewno, through Czarne (Hammerstein) and Cz≈Çuch√≥w (Schlochau). They reached Czarne around 10 or 11 April, but were surprised to realize then that the Polish forces of Koniecpolski were very close, in Cz≈Çuch√≥w. They attempted to break through Debrzno, but were repulsed by the Polish forces. Surrounded from most sides, and slightly reinforced by the rear guard under Johan Friedrich von K√∂tteritz, the Swedes begun fortifying their positions, preparing for a siege. Battle At the time of the battle, the Swedes, not counting a unit under K√∂tteritz which garrisoned a nearby crossing at Gwda Wielka, numbered about 1,700‚Äì1,800. Koniecpolski had only about 1,200‚Äì1,300 under his command, but ordered his units to advance on 12 April. The Swedish field fortifications were not finished, and Poles were able to break through the Swedish cavalry trying to protect them; however, they were turned back by infantry fire. A second Polish attack that day, with infantry support, also did not manage to defeat the Swedes. By 13 April Polish reinforcements had arrived, giving Koniecpolski a slight numerical superiority. By 13 April the morale of the Swedish troops began weakening, and increasingly, there was talk about surrender. This began impacting the activity of Swedish troops, likely nullifying some planned raids outside their fortifications. Some negotiations begun on April 14, but were futile, and another Polish assault on April 15, while not fully successful, caused a mutiny in the Swedish camp, and eventually Streiff and Teuffel were arrested by their soldiers. Negotiation ensued, mostly concluded and signed on April 16, with an official ceremony on August 17. The Swedish infantry was to join the Polish army, the reiters were to swear never to fight against the Polish king, with volunteers also allowed to join the Polish army, and the Swedish loot from nearby lands was to be returned to the owners (this caused some annoyance within the Polish army, whose soldiers preferred to continue fighting to take the loot for themselves). Eventually, about 500 reiters and 800 infantry joined the Polish army; about 250 reiters left for the Polish borders. Aftermath Koniecpolski then turned his army to advance against the main Swedish army of Axel Oxenstierna. The Polish victory, although only on a sideline of the major front of the war, had significant repercussions. It increased the morale of Poland and its allies; motivating Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig) forces to advance towards G≈Çowa, the Elector of Brandenburg to officially ally himself with Poland, Lithuania to renounce its own ceasefire with Sweden, and other foreign powers supporting Sweden at that time (Ottomans and Russia) to become less aggressive. With regard to the tactical situation, Koniecpolski managed to destroy most Swedish activity on the western bank of the Vistula, and limited their presence to only the eastern bank. He also reinforced his own army, preventing the Swedes from achieving the quick victory they desired.

In recent years, it has largely concentrated on aircraft repairs as well as component manufacturing for overseas companies. The company was founded by Royal Decree in 1920 under the name ASAM. It was rebranded as IRMA during 1944. In 1978, the company again changed its name to IAvB - √éntreprinderea de Avioane Bucure»ôti (Bucharest Enterprise Aircraft). Finally, it was rebranded as Romaero S.A. in 1991.Romanian Aviation IndustryUn deceniu de la inaugurarea sediului AutoritƒÉ≈£ii Aeronautice Civile Rom√¢ne Perhaps its largest manufacturing programme that the company has been involved in was mass production of the British-designed Britten-Norman Islander; over 500 airframes were reportedly completed in Romania. Another major independent undertaking of the firm was the Rombac 1-11 airliner, a license-produced model of the BAC One-Eleven produced in Romania; however, sales never reached expectations and the programme was abandoned during the late 1990s. History =Early years= Since the company's early years, particularly under the guise of IRMA, it has specialised in the overhaul of various types of aircraft. Specifically, it was involved in the repair and services of numerous Soviet aircraft, including the Li-2, IL-14, IL-18, Antonov An-2, An-24, An-26 and An-30. The company also produced a number of indigenously-developed aircraft, which were categorised as either light aircraft or agricultural aircraft: IAR-818, IAR-821, and IAR-822. During 1968, IRMA secured an arrangement to manufacture the British Britten-Norman Islander, a popular twin-engined multipurpose aircraft. According to the company, IRMA was responsible for producing in excess of 500 Islanders, roughly half of those ever produced. While production of the type came to a close during the late 1990s it was reported that negotiations for Romaero to resume production of the Islander had reached an advanced stage by 2002. However, Britten-Norman subsequently decided to bring manufacturing inhouse. =ROMBAC One-Eleven= Romavia Rombac 1-11 A Ryanair Rombac One- Eleven seen at Stuttgart Airport (1992) On 9 June 1979, Romanian president Nicolae Ceau≈üescu signed an agreement with the British Aerospace for the licensed production of the BAC One-Eleven in Romania. This was to involve the delivery of three complete One-Elevens (two 500-series aircraft and one 475 series) plus the construction of at least 22 in Bucharest, with reducing British content. It also involved Romanian production of Spey engines and certification of the aircraft to British standards by the Civil Aviation Authority. A market for up to 80 Romanian-built airliners was projected, largely in China and other developing economies, as well as Eastern Europe. The aircraft was re-designated Rombac 1-11.Chorlton Aeroplane November 2012, pp. 80‚Äì81.Taylor 1982, p. 173. The first Rombac One-Eleven, (YR-BRA cn 401) a series 561RC, was rolled out at Romaero's BƒÉneasa factory on 27 August 1982 and first flew on 18 September 1982. Production continued until 1989 at a much slower pace than had been previously foreseen. Nine aircraft were delivered, while the tenth and eleventh airliners on the production line being abandoned when they were 85% and 70% complete respectively.Pilling Air International October 1992, p. 213. The first Rombac was delivered to TAROM on 29 December 1982.Pilling Air International October 1992, p. 214. The Romanian carrier took delivery of all but two of the airliners produced, the remaining two going to Romavia, the last of which (YR-BRI cn 409) was delivered on 1 January 1993. Romania's economy and international position deteriorated to the point where supplies for One-Eleven manufacturing slowed to a trickle, with hard currency restrictions delaying overseas component deliveries; the market foreseen had largely lacked interest, though some Rombac airliners were leased to European operators. The One-Eleven's noise level and fuel economy failed to keep pace with US and West European competition. Following the fall of the Ceau≈üescu regime, plans were made to restart production using the Rolls-Royce Tay. British aircraft leasing company Associated Aerospace agreed a $1 billion deal to purchase 50 Tay-powered One-Elevens fitted with a new electronic glass cockpit for onward leasing to Western customers; however, the liquidation of Associated Aerospace in April 1991 ended this deal. Efforts to sell the One- Eleven continued through the 1990s.Pilling Air International October 1992, pp. 213‚Äì214.Beech, Eric. \\"Rombac Tay 1-11s offered for lease\\".

In April 1997, Romaero announced was abandoning efforts to launch its envisioned revamp of the One-Eleven, which it referred to as the Airstar 2500. =Post-Cold War= During the 1990s, the company, recently rebranded as Romaero, became heavily engaged in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector, performing such work for numerous European operators across a large number of commercial aircraft. It also formed agreements with various international manufacturers as a subcontractor, undertaking subassembly and manufacturing work for companies such as Bombardier Aviation for the CL-415 flying boat as well as Boeing's 737 and 757 airliners. Romaero continued its long-term relationship with the Britten-Norman company as well. During early 1999, it was announced that the company was to be acquired by Britten-Norman from the Romanian government in exchange for $80.5 million. At the time, Britten-Norman also announced plans to invest substantial sums in the firm's manufacturing facilities at Baneasa Airport, including in its design and MRO capabilities. However, the acquisition was later abandoned following a dispute over the deal's cost. During 2000, Romaero became the first aerospace company in Romania to receive JAR-145 approval from the Joint Aviation Authorities, enhancing its standing as a provider of MRO services. Throughout the 2000s, Romaero continued to seek out participation in Western European aircraft manufacturing programs. In 2003, a deal with BAE Systems was announced for Romaero to build cargo conversion kits for the British Aerospace ATP short- haul airliner; the first example was completed during the following year. During 2006, a long-term agreement was signed with Saab AB and the firm concerning the manufacture of subassemblies and components; Saab referred to the deal as a strategic alliance. That same year, it was announced that Romaero would be performing manufacturing work on the ATR 42 and ATR 72 regional aircraft in favour of prior arrangements based in Naples; the transfer was viewed as only the first step towards work on further projects undertaken by Alenia Aeronautica, such as the Alenia C-27J Spartan. In 2003, Romaero became the American Lockheed Martin aircraft factory service center for C-130 Hercules aircraft repairs.

USAF RBS used various ground radar, computers, and other electronic equipment such as jammers to disrupt operations of the bomber's radar navigator, AAA/SAM simulators to require countermeasures from the bomber, and Radar Bomb Scoring Centrals for estimating accuracy of simulated bombings. Scores for accuracy and electronic warfare effectiveness were transmitted from radar sites such as those at Strategic Range Training Complexes (e.g., from Detachment 1 at the \\"La Junta Bomb Plot\\"). Most of the SAC sites were in the continental US with units (detachments) manned by technicians and operators of the Automatic Tracking Radar Specialist career field (AutoTrack). Radar Bomb Scoring and the Autotrack specialty were discontinued shortly after the end of the Cold War when increased munitions accuracy (e.g., GPS-guided JDAMs 1st used in 1993) reduced the need for scoring of simulated bomb runs, and GPS avionics allow onboard tracking for \\"no-drop bomb scoring\\" of unguided bombs.

Its leaves are green, rigid, and glossy, measuring are up to long and divided into segments up to in length. The inflorescence is an umbel with up to 10 reflexed rays bearing yellow flowers. The fruit has scattered oil tubes, a characteristic that helps distinguish this plant from related species. When crushed, the fruits smell like \\"fresh peaches\\". Endemic to the southern Rocky Mountains in the United States, this plant is known from seven counties in Colorado; it may also occur in northern New Mexico. Its population has been estimated at 48,680 to 58,490 individual plants. This plant grows mainly on volcanic soils. It can be found on dikes, lava flows, and tuff outcrops. It also grows on sedimentary rock. It can often be found in rock cracks on steep slopes and cliff faces. It is a very dry habitat, usually with full sun exposure. Though there are generally few other plants in the habitat, associated species may include Pinus edulis, P. ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Rhus trilobata, Cercocarpus montanus, Ribes cereum, Eriogonum jamesii, Opuntia polyacantha, Echinocereus triglochidiatus, Heterotheca villosa, and Yucca glauca.

The road runs north-south, providing views of the city and Bay of Gibraltar. Previously known in Spanish as Senda del Moro (), the traditional Llanito name for the road is Cuesta de Mr. Bourne. The road angles along the west side of the Rock of Gibraltar to the Flat Bastion, a fortification. Married quarters were built along the road. In the nineteenth century there were outbreaks of yellow fever in the 1820s and of diphtheria in the 1880s among the residents, apparently due to faulty sewers. Developments included, in the 1830s a school for poor children which remained in use as a school into the early twentieth century and a club where masked balls were held. In modern times the bastion's magazine has been refurbished for civilian use, the barracks have been converted into affordable housing, and parking has become an issue. Background Flat Bastion Road begins to the southeast of the Garrison Library, at the intersection of Prince Edward's Road and Castle Road, north of its junction with Devil's Gap Road. Proceeding in a southerly direction, it becomes Gardiner's Road as it passes through Charles V Wall, just before it reaches Europa Road. The road runs along the west side of the Rock of Gibraltar, leading to the Flat Bastion fortification. The original Flat Bastion, then called Baluarte de Santiago (Santiago's Bastion), was built by the Spanish some time between 1565 and 1627. It may have been designed by Daniel Specklin. It was one of the fortifications along the Charles V Wall that protected the new Africa Gate. The Flat Bastion Magazine within the Bastion was once a point where immense quantities of gunpowder were stored. It was threatened by a fire in 1874 that swept through the long grass and other vegetation of the south districts of the colony and reached Charles V's wall before burning out. History Roads of Gibraltar. Flat Bastion Road can be seen on the right. It becomes Gardiner's Road just south of the Flat Bastion, which is just east of Trafalgar Cemetery. Conditions were unsanitary in the 19th century. The road is mentioned in 1828 when there was an outbreak of yellow fever in Gibraltar. A French medical commission visited the colony and documented their findings on the spread of the epidemic. Many of the reported cases were in houses on Flat Bastion Road. By September most of the houses on the road were infected. A sanitary sewer that ran parallel to the road was suspected. One source said it did not emit any excessive odours that seemed out of the normal. However, the French commission said that the sewer outside at least one of the houses in the road emitted a very bad smell (\\"une tr√®s mauvaise odeur\\"). A report of 1 September 1828 described Wilson's Buildings, two wooden sheds on the road to Flat Bastion, as \\"decidedly inimical to the health of any persons who may inhabit them.\\" Flat Bastion Road in 1885, from Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly Families living on the road in 1828 included those of Josepha Bernado, Jose Nu√±ez, the financier Grellet, the family of Thomas Gum, and the family of Michaela Medina. In 1832 the Gibraltar Public School, a free English-language establishment for poor children, was set up in a government-owned building on Flat Bastion Road. Funded by the contributions of wealthy people in the colony, it was open to children of all faiths. By 1833, there were 181 boys and 99 girls at the school. After boys were excluded in 1897, it continued as a school for girls into the early 20th century. An 1883 Sanitary Order in Council aimed at reducing health risks defined Flat Bastion Road as one of the boundaries of the \\"streets, ramps, roads, lanes, passages, alleys, stairs and public places\\" within which the new regulations would apply. The Army Medical Department reported in 1889 that several cases of diphtheria had occurred in the married quarters on Flat Bastion Road. It turned out that the rainwater pipes from the roof were cracked. The pipes were connected directly to the sewer, and sewer gas was escaping into the rooms. The road was depicted in an article on the colony that appeared in 1885 in Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, a New York-based magazine, in a pastiche of ink drawings that also depict \\"Catland Bay\\" (Catalan Bay), Waterport Gate, the signal station and the rock from the Spanish lines. A donkey is depicted in the foreground. Jeanie Conan depicted the picturesque road in a watercolour titled \\"Flat Bastion Rd. Gibraltar\\" in 1888. A visitor noted that the \\"Ladysmith club\\" on the Flat Bastion Road was holding masquerades in its salons, while elsewhere the Salvation Army was preaching and parading signs with advice from the gospels. Modern times During the 1970 census, residents on the road were counted as part of the Gowlands Ramp enumeration area. The magazine is now a geological research facility and exhibition centre involved with the lithology of Gibraltar. The barracks, north of the bastion on Flat Bastion Road, have been renovated and converted into affordable residential housing. The Flat Bastion barracks redevelopment project started by 2007, and was completed about 2010. The development has been renamed Flat Bastion Mews. Communal gardens for the new housing were established at that time. The two bedroom apartments also included allocated parking. The government's Traffic, Parking and Transport Plan issued in 2009, mentions a parking project for Flat Bastion Road under which 104 parking spots were to be added. In 2010 there was public criticism about the lack of parking on the road as the government had removed existing parking before constructing the new parking spaces.

The northern side of the avenue is occupied by Balmaceda Park. Just east of Jos√© Miguel Claro Avenue, Providencia splits into two one-way streets. Westbound continues under the name Providencia, and the eastbound becomes Nueva Providencia Avenue (formerly known as 11 de Septiembre Avenue), which came into existence in 1980 as a measure to reduce traffic congestion on Providencia Avenue and was part of a dual project that also included the eastward extension of the Line 1 of the Santiago Metro. The former name of the street was an allusion to the date of the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat.Its present name was given in 2013, though Nueva Providencia was the proposed name for the street when it was originally planned. The streets rejoin just past Antonio Varas Avenue. This segment is home to the Iglesia de la Divina Providencia, which gives its name to the avenue. The avenue forks again and passes through the commercial heart of Providencia. The fork to the south is also called Nueva Providencia, which merges with Providencia Avenue east of Los Leones Avenue.

Early life and career Radke was born December 17, 1970. She was raised in Morris, Minnesota, but at the age of 13, she and her family moved to Emmaus, Pennsylvania. By the time she was 14, she had landed a spot on the U.S. National Swim Team, and was its youngest member. She won gold medals at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in 1985 and 1987, as part of the 800-meter (4 √ó 200m) Freestyle Relay Team. In 1988, she made it onto the U.S. Olympic Swim Team. That year, she finished fifth in the final of the women's 200-meter butterfly event at the Seoul Olympics, recording a time of 2:11.55. During this time, she was also a member of the swim team at her high school, Germantown Academy (GA), in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. College years Upon graduating GA in 1989, she enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where she broke school records while swimming for their varsity team. During her time in college, she also continued swimming for Team USA, winning two more gold medals along the way, while becoming a national champion swimmer in the 200-meter butterfly at the 1990 U.S. Long-Course Championships, where she competed alongside such swimmers as Janet Evans and Summer Sanders. Radke also was a co-captain on Team USA. She graduated Berkeley with a Bachelor's degree in International Business and Ethics, and then earned a Master's degree in Marriage and Family Therapy at Southern Connecticut State University. Health issues While still in high school, Radke contracted mononucleosis. Despite this, she continued to compete in swim meets even at the highest level. In 1991, she learned that she had chronic fatigue syndrome, which forced her to sit out the 1992 Olympic trials. Soon, her condition got so bad, that she found herself bedridden and had to use handicapped parking spaces when driving. In 1993, she retired from competitive swimming due to her ongoing bout with CFIDS. After 12 years of battling the disease, she finally felt well enough to attempt a comeback in Olympic swimming. She participated in the 2004 Olympic trials, thus enabling her to re-enter the world rankings after more than a decade of retirement. In 2012, Radke authored and released a book on her life story and struggles with CFIDS, entitled Be Your Best Without the Stress. Survivor On August 30, 2017, it was announced that Radke was one of 18 competitors on Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers, the 35th season of the U.S. version of Survivor. She was part of the Levu (Heroes) tribe and was the first person voted out of the game. Personal life Radke is married to former Stanford University and Olympic swim coach Ross Gerry. Together, they reside in Excelsior, Minnesota, and have two children. Later career Radke works as a marriage and family therapist (MFT), as well as an online professor for Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California. She and her husband also run a motivational coaching and health business in the Twin Cities, called WeCoach4U.

It is unclear who started the battle. Thousands of rebels infiltrated Damascus from the surrounding countryside. Following this, according to some reports, the opposition forces launched an operation to capture the capital, while according to other reports, the military learned of the large-scale rebel operation beforehand and made a preemptive strike. Some reports even suggested the rebels launched the operation prematurely due to their plans being discovered by the security forces. After the rebels initially captured half a dozen districts and killed four high-ranking government ministers in a bombing, opposition forces were forced to retreat following a military counter-attack, leaving the army in control of the capital after three weeks of fighting. It was the first time tanks and helicopters had been deployed in central Damascus and left parts of the city as a warzone. Battle =Operation Damascus Volcano= Attack routes of the Free Syrian Army during Operation Damascus Volcano On 15 July, fierce fighting was reported in some quarters of central Damascus as the army moved in to dislodge rebels. The rebels fighting were the ones who were routed from Douma and other suburbs and fled to Damascus itself. Fighting also closed the road leading from central Damascus to airport. The rebels were also on the offensive, attacking the Hajar al-Aswad district. On 16 July, for a second day, heavy clashes in the southern Midan and Tadhamon districts of Damascus raged with the military managing to surround the rebel forces in the area and sending tanks and other armored vehicles into the neighborhoods. The FSA had reportedly taken control of the two districts earlier and the military was making attempts to overrun it. The rebels called the clashes a raid by them against the capital, while the government called it a 48-hour military operation to clear the area of any opposition forces. There were also indications that the government knew about the planned rebel raid and acted on the information. According to state TV, the military killed over 80 rebel fighters during the fighting. On 17 July, shooting was reported in one of the main central streets and machine-gun fire was reported in nearby Sabaa Bahrat Square, site of the Central Bank of Syria, which was the scene of several major pro-government demonstrations. A brief firefight also erupted near the Syrian parliament building. Fighting was ongoing in the southern Midan and Kfar Sousa districts and the northern Barzeh and Qaboun districts. Artillery shelling was reported in all of them and specifically in Midan it was reported to be \\"hysterical\\", according to activists. At the same time, in Barzeh and Qaboun, helicopter rocket strikes were reported. Later, helicopter strikes were reportedly hitting all four neighborhoods. The state-run news agency reported that rebel forces had retreated from the Nahr Aisha district to Midan, where fighting was continuing. Army reinforcements were sent from the Golan Heights to help defend the capital. This was confirmed by Israeli army intelligence. \\"The Syrian military is acting very brutally, which shows the regime is desperate. Its control of Damascus is getting weaker,\\" Major General Aviv Kochavi told a parliamentary committee in Israel. The rebels claimed to have killed 70 soldiers and pro-government militiamen in the previous two days of clashes, while the government reported 14 rebel vehicles were destroyed and an army officer stated that they killed 33 rebels, wounded 15 and captured 145 in the day's fighting in the Qaboun area, where the majority of opposition forces were reportedly.Syrian rebels battling to ‚Äòliberate‚Äô Damascus An activist, Shakeeb al-Jabri, claimed that more than 200 soldiers had been killed or wounded in total. A deputy police chief, Brigadier General Issa Duba, was said to have died from wounds sustained during the clashes, according to a pro- Assad website. The FSA stated they destroyed one armored vehicle and captured another and that, among the members of the Syrian military who were killed, were several rooftop snipers. The opposition also claimed to have shot down an army helicopter in the Qaboun district. There were contradictions among the rebels themselves on the nature of the conflict. One FSA commander declared that the \\"battle for liberation of Damascus had begun\\". The FSA dubbed their assault Operation Damascus Volcano. But Tarek, the rebel spokesman in Damascus, stated the clashes were still only skirmishes. He also said the FSA didn't start the battle, which would be in line with earlier reports that the military made a preemptive strike on the opposition forces, after learning of their plan for the attack on the capital. Government Information Minister Omran Zoabi stated that the military confronted rebel forces who infiltrated the city, surrounded them and forced many to retreat, while the rest were still being dealt with. RT reporter Maria Finoshina stated that fighting was nowhere near the level she experienced during the government assault on the suburb of Douma the previous week. She said that except for continuing occasional gunfire and military patrols ‚Äúit doesn't seem like final or decisive battle for the capital\\". Several videos of the fighting in the capital emerged during the day. =Damascus bombing= On 18 July, Syrian state TV reported that a suicide attack that targeted National Security headquarters in Damascus killed Syrian defense minister General Daoud Rajha during a meeting of ministers and a number of heads of security agencies. Many other VIPs were wounded and killed in the attack as well. Also killed were Assef Shawkat, Bashar al-Assad's brother-in-law and deputy defense minister, the assistant to the vice president general Hassan Turkomani and Hafez Makhlouf, head of investigations at the Syrian Intelligence Agency. The country's intelligence chief Hisham Bekhityar was seriously wounded (died 2 days later). There were conflicting reports on the fate of the Interior minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Shaar with initial accounts stating that he had also been killed, but later state TV reported that he survived although wounded. Additional reports stated that he was in stable condition. The bomber was reportedly a bodyguard of one of the meeting attendant. The opposition meanwhile claimed that the cause of the explosion was not a suicide bomber, but that a rebel insider planted bombs inside of the building and detonated it remotely from a distant location. Also, during the night, residents reported that an army barracks near the Presidential Palace, about a hundred meters from the presidential palace itself, came under heavy fire with residents posting video showing a fire, but no explosions were heard. Earlier in the day, SANA stated that government troops were pushing into the Midan district. At the same time, SOHR relayed that the Barzeh and Qaboun districts were under helicopter attack. Fighting was also reported in the Kfar Souseh and Nahr Aisha districts. After the bombing, the Free Syrian Army claimed that army troops had withdrawn from the Midan district. However, less than an hour later, state TV claimed to be broadcasting live footage of clashes in the neighborhood. According to Al-Jazeera, the military shelled the district. Early in the evening, opposition activists reported that Midan was raided by the military. The FSA meanwhile moved its troops to the al-Sabina area. Residents in the Barzeh district, where rebels were holding out earlier, reported that only government troops were to be found in the neighborhood's streets. Opposition activists claimed that Syrian army commander Mohammad al- Bardan defected to the rebel side along with his soldiers and Al Arabiya reported that soldiers from 3rd Armored Division were withdrawing from several Damascus districts and leaving their tanks behind following the bombing. However, this was not independently confirmed or relayed by other news media. Reuters reported that the Syrian Army escalated its response to the bombing by firing on suburbs from artillery batteries located on a mountain overlooking Damascus. Al Jazeera meanwhile reported that FSA was able to shoot down two helicopters that had been shelling Tadamon and Al-Hajjar al-Aswad districts. As before, this report could not be independently verified due to restrictions placed on the journalists. A monitoring group, SOHR, reported that 60 soldiers had been killed on the third and fourth day of fighting. The security forces gave residents 48 hours to flee the fighting area. One military source told that the army exercised restraint in its response in Damascus but that after the bombing, they would use all their weapons to finish the rebels. =Military counter-attack= Syrian soldier manning a checkpoint with a PK machine gun On 19 July, the military launched an offensive to push back rebel forces that infiltrated Damascus. Damascus residents reported ongoing shelling of several districts, including Midan and Kafr Souseh. Residents were meanwhile arming themselves, with many citizens fleeing districts which were hit by ongoing battles. The army removed its checkpoints around Midan district and the ancient Old City for reasons unknown. Afterwards, opposition groups accused the Syrian army in massacring 100 civilians that had been shot and killed by security forces gunfire during a funeral procession in al-Sayida Zainab on the outskirts of Damascus. However, later reports by opposition groups revised the toll to at least 60. Meanwhile, the FSA reportedly shelled Damascus International Airport with mortars 20 times. It was reported that the president, Bashar al-Assad, was in the coastal city of Latakia, directing the fighting in Damascus. However, it was unclear if he traveled there from Damascus before or after the bombing attack. One opposition official stated that they had information he may have been in Latakia for days. Meanwhile, following the Damascus bombing, his mother and sister went to Tartus. During the day, al-Assad was shown on state TV attending the swearing-in of his new defense minister.First sign of Syria's Assad emerges after attack An activist based in the eastern Damascus district Mezze said in interview with The Guardian that rebels had taken control over the Midan and Qaboun districts with fighting raging in Kafr Souseh and Mezze. He also claimed three tanks were destroyed in Kafr Souseh by the FSA. Later that day, the Syrian Army stormed the Qaboun district with a large number of tanks, according to the opposition group Syrian Observatory, who said the army's move stoked fears of an imminent massacre in the area. Earlier, rebels attacked the central police command in Old Damascus, killing five officers. That night, Syrian State TV broadcast footage of Qaboun, showing the corpses of about 20 dead rebels. The opposition group, Syrian Observatory, said that 23 rebels and 47 alleged civilians were killed in Damascus during the day. The following day, security sources told AFP that the Army had launched a general offensive in Damascus. The Syrian Army continued its counter-attack, storming the quarter of Jobar in Damascus, searching for rebels. The Syrian official press agency stated that the army inflicted heavy losses on the rebels in Qaboun and that the Syrian Army regained control of Midan. The rebels confirmed this stating they had been forced to withdraw from Midan after the army assault. Rebel fighters stormed and burned the Sa'iqa military camp, which was being used as a training facility, in the Basateen al-Mezzeh district in central Damascus according to activists. At the end of 20 July, Damascus center and areas beyond were reported to be under firm government control with some fighting continuing only in the outskirts. The rebels who were fighting near the Yarbouk camp were overrun by the Army and the Palestinian factions loyal to the government. On 21 July, a security source told AFP that the Army took control of Tadamon, Qaboun and Barzeh, in addition to Midan, the previous day, but that fighting was still ongoing in the Jobar, Kfar Sousa and Mazeeh quarters. It was later confirmed that Barzeh was still rebel-held.Syrian forces launch all-out Damascus assault  The Jakarta Globe Activists claimed that fighting was still reported in Damascus proper, with clashes in the northern Barzeh and Rukneddine districts and that a police station was attacked on Khaled bin Waleed street, with an activist saying rebels in Damascus were staging hit-and-run attacks as opposed to controlling areas. Still, during the morning, the city was largely calm according to residents. SOHR said the military bombarded the Al-Kaddam and Assali neighborhoods of Damascus. Residents also reported fighting in the Al-Hajar Al-Aswad and Tadamon districts. Undated online video posted by activists appeared to show the local police station being overrun at Yarmouk and clashes were reported in the Northern suburb of al-Tal, where the head of the local Political Security Directorate (PSD) branch and all his staff reportedly surrendered to FSA fighters. 12 civilians were reported killed during the day, seven of them by sniper fire. However, Reuters confirmed that the city was calm and that the police checkpoints which had been abandoned during the fighting were back. During the day, Brig. Gen. Nabil Zougheib, a Christian, was assassinated along with his wife and two sons. Islamist radicals from the Wahhabist rebel group Brigade of Islam claimed responsible for the killings. Islamist fighters from the Muslim Brotherhood also reportedly attacked Iraqi refugees in the southeastern part of the city. On 22 July, fierce fighting was reported along with intense shelling by reporters. Activists said that helicopter gunships fired rockets into a southern Damascus neighbourhood. A journalist reported that helicopters were also shelling Barzeh. Later, the Syrian Army led by the Fourth division stormed the district of Barzeh. The Fourth division also routed the rebels out of Mezzeh after 1,000 troops entered the district backed-up by armoured vehicles, tanks and bulldozers. The military continued their advance by forcing the rebels to withdraw from Rukn al-Din. State media reported that the soldiers were pursuing the last remnants of the rebels. By the end of the day, activists confirmed that Barzeh was also overrun by government troops and that at least five young men, possibly rebels, were summarily executed. The rebel operation to capture Damascus seemed close to collapse according to a journalist and activists reported that army soldiers executed at least 20 unarmed men in Mezzeh that they suspected of aiding rebels. Syrian State media showed graphic images of foreign Arab fighters killed in Qaboun, including two Egyptians and three Jordanians, identified by their identity papers. The next day, the bodies of 23 people, who were reportedly \\"executed\\" in Mezze and Barzeh, were found, some of which had torture marks. Meanwhile, the Israeli military confirmed that president Assad, along with his family, was still in the capital, contradicting earlier reports that they left the city for Latakia. =FSA retreat= On 23 July, the government declared most of the rebel forces that attacked the capital to be defeated. An opposition activist confirmed this by saying that government troops had taken control of almost all of the capital. Following this, there were disagreements between rebel commanders about the opportunity of having launched the Damascus battle as rebel colonel Riad al-Asaad disagreed with rebel colonel Qasem Saadedine who started the operation. The opposition activist group SOHR stated that 94 people were killed during the previous two days of fighting.Fighting in Syria indicates Bashar Assad's end isn't imminent A man claiming to be a civilian from Midan said \\"Midan is back to normal. There were some militias who tried to control the neighbourhood, but the army came in. The [rebel] fighters were from outside Midan. Now it is free of all military opposition presence.\\" In regards to the reported executions he said \\"I can't confirm or deny it. But I don't think execute is the right word. These people are fighters. They are not civilians. If they were killed it doesn't mean they were executed, and they were not captured and then killed. They were killed during the operation.\\" He also added that Mezzeh was not fully under government control, with the eastern orchard being a hideout for rebels. He added \\"People are being encouraged to come back to Damascus. There's been a big media campaign by al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya making people believe that the whole area was under rebel control, but they only controlled some streets.\\" Asked about Assad's whereabouts he said \\"I know he is in Damascus. The new minister of defence took the oath of office in the presidential palace with the president. This is the same room they have used for years.\\" However, other civilians were terrified for Government reprisals to speak openly in front of a camera. Alex Thompson stated that in his journey to Midan terrified locals told him that \\"They used cannons, mortar, machine guns, tanks, they used helicopters ‚Äì they use everything against us.\\" Others said that the pro-Government militia, shabiba, massacred a family of sixteen in the district. Thompson claimed that the incident resembled the same \\"story we heard of Al-Houla\\" with \\"The familiar pattern of heavy shelling and bombardment followed by militia going house to house looting and massacring.\\" Thompson described a scene in Midan of pulverised buildings and bodies lying on the streets. The corpses of 24 executed rebel fighters were found on 24 July in the suburbs of Daraya. Meanwhile, several shells hit the southern suburb of Hajar al-Aswad. The opposition reported that the Syrian Army attacked the last rebel pockets in the Damascus districts of Qaddam and al- Aswad. In other parts of the city, journalist Alex Thompson described that the battle as a victory for the Syrian Army, and a morale boost for the regime. In the evening, activists confirmed that most of the rebels had withdrawn from the capital.Top general, friend of Syrian president, defects =The battle concludes= The rebel-held town of Al-Tal, on the outskirts of Damascus, was heavily bombarded on 25 July by the 216th Mechanized Battalion of the Syrian Army. Residents and opposition activists reported that residential buildings were hit. On the same day, opposition activists released amateur footage of what they claimed were the bodies of 23 people in various houses who were \\"massacred\\" during the previous days in the Qaboun district. On 26 July, fighting was reported in the Hajar al-Aswad district of the capital, a place described as one of the last rebel strongholds in Damascus. The FSA withdrew to the district which was subsequently shelled by government forces. According to an opposition activist, clashes continued across most of the southern part of the city. Five civilians were reportedly killed. The army also attacked the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, despite there being no rebel presence. Residents mentioned tanks, helicopter gunships and snipers who shot at anyone in the street. The FSA were reported to be in the district of Tadamon and shelling was still reported in the neighbourhoods of Orouba and Thalathin. On 29 July, SANA reported that government troops had cleared the Hajar al-Aswad district of rebel forces.Syrian Army Disbands Tens of Terrorist Cells in Damascus Following the retreat of rebel forces from much the city, fighting continued. Rebel remnants, that did not pull back from Damascus with the other opposition forces, converged on the Tadamon district, where they made the area their final stronghold. The military launched an operation on 1 August to clear them out and by 3 August dozens of military vehicles had entered the district. During the fighting, on 2 August, mortars hit the nearby Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, killing 15-21 people.In Syria, mortars kill 21 in Damascus refugee camp On 1 August, at the same time as the Tadamon operation started, the military raided the town of Jdaidet Artuz, southwest of Damascus, rounding up around 100 people suspected of being rebel sympathisers or opposition activists. The detainees were taken to a school where they were reportedly tortured and 43 of them were executed, according to SOHR. Syrian state media reported that the armed group located in the city was defeated, with dozens of insurgents killed, and that most of the others surrendered later. A picture of some prisoners was then published. The State media also reported that similar successful operations on Yalda and Babila took place against the insurgents. A poster of Syria's president at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Damascus On 4 August, the Tadamon district was cleared of insurgents and the general who led the operation, which involved special forces, announced during a press tour of the quarter that the whole of Damascus had been secured and was under the full control of the Syrian Army. The Syrian Army reported that there were 800 rebels in Tadamon, and that 300 of them had been killed in the last assault. The Army also uncovered a mass grave where 20 civilians and army personnel had been buried. Upon retaking the capital Damascus, the Syrian government began a campaign of collective punishment against the civilian residents of Sunni suburbs in-and-around the capital which had supported FSA presence in their neighborhoods. Aftermath Situation in Damascus 15 August 2012 Following the battle, the FSA stated that they were to conduct guerrilla hit-and-run attacks against security forces in the capital in the future. On 11 August, the Syrian army clashed with rebels in the heart of Damascus near the Syrian central bank according to state TV and residents. An explosion was followed by fighting which appeared to be spreading, said the resident, who asked not to be named for fear of arrest. \\"The explosion was huge. There has been fighting for the past half an hour along Pakistan Street. I am very close. Can you hear that?\\" she asked, to the sound of a loud bang. On 15 August, the Free Syrian Army claimed it was behind a bomb attack on a military base near the UN hotel in central Damascus. Three people were injured. Afterwards, fighting between rebels and government forces took place in Mezzeh, near the Iranian embassy, and in the districts of Tadamon and Yarmouk. Also, al-Qadam and al-Asali were reportedly bombarded by the military and residents reported heavy gunfire. The military also freed the Al-Ikhbariya TV news team after an operation in the Damascus countryside. Another nine people were also reportedly freed in other operations. The same day, the military launched a new offensive, with the aim of clearing rebel forces from towns around Damascus. During the operation, the Army captured the rebel-held towns of Al-Tall, Mouadamiya and Daraya and the southern Damascus districts of Kfar Souseh and Nahr Aisha.Syrian forces kill at least 31 in Damascus raids During the attack on Daraya, the army reportedly committed a massacre, putting the blame on FSA (see Darayya massacre). On 26 September, Iranian state sponsored Press TV correspondent Maya Nasser was shot and killed by a sniper while reporting live. In the later half of 2012, Qasem Soleimani assumed personal control of the Iranian involvement in the Syrian Civil War, when the Iranians became deeply concerned about the Assad government's inability to fight the opposition, and the negative consequences to the Islamic Republic if the Syrian government fell. Soleimani reportedly coordinated the war from a base in Damascus, as the rebels came close to government headquarters by digging underground tunnels, according to Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

The North American Plant Protection Organization (NAPPO), operating between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, was created in 1976 to set Regional Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (RSPM). It depends upon regulators, scientists, producers and industry associations to collaborate in scientific standards to protect agricultural, forest, and other plant resources while facilitating trade. The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), established 1951, is an international plant health agreement that aims to protect cultivated and wild plants by preventing the introduction and spread of pests.

Her death was mourned by Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh and many other Indians.Frontline Article on Mrinal Gore Mrinal Gore was born Mrinal Mohile in a Marathi CKP family and was a medical student. Towards the end of her schooling she came in contact with Rashtra Seva Dal - the cultural and social wing of the Socialist Party. Her inspiration was Sane Guruji and it was RSD that brought her in touch with dynamic leaders like Keshav Gore, a Marathi Brahmin, who mentored the young recruits during the days prior to Independence. She and Keshav Gore married and had a daughter. Unfortunately, Keshav died when Mrinal was 30 and the daughter was only 5. She earned the sobriquet Paaniwali Bai (water lady) for her effort to bring drinking water supply to Goregaon, a North Mumbai suburb. She led many protests along with her contemporaries Ahilya Rangnekar and Pramila Dandavate. She was the leader of opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and elected to 6th Lok Sabha from Mumbai North (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1977. When she was elected MP in 1977, the same election that Indira Gandhi lost, the popular slogan was Paaniwali bai Dilli mein, Dilliwali bai paani mein, meaning the water lady (Mrinal) has reached Delhi (Parliament) but the Delhi lady (Indira Gandhi) is in the water.

The conflict first emerged among the Arab tribes that constituted the Umayyad army and administration in the 7th and 8th centuries. Membership in either faction was rooted in the genealogical origins, real or perceived, of the Arab tribes, which divided them into south Arabian descendants of Qahtan (Yaman) or north Arabian descendants of Adnan (Qays). Yamani tribes, including the Kalb, Ghassan, Tanukh, Judham and Lakhm, were well-established in central and southern Syria in pre-Islamic times, while Qaysi tribes, such as the Sulaym, Kilab and Uqayl, largely migrated to northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia with the Muslim armies in the mid-7th century. The Qays‚ÄìYaman feud did not effectively take shape until after the reign of Caliph Mu'awiyah I, who, along with his Sufyanid descendants, were tied to the Kalb, the leading tribe of Yaman, through marriage and military dependence. When the last Sufyanid caliph died in 684, the Yaman resolved to ensure continued Umayyad rule so as to maintain their stately privileges, while the Qays backed Abdullah ibn Zubayr's bid for the caliphate. That year, the Yaman routed the Qays at the Battle of Marj Rahit, leading to years of revenge-driven, tit-for-tat raids known as ayyam (days) because the battles were typically day-long affairs. By 693, the ayyam largely subsided as the Qays reconciled with the Umayyads and were incorporated into the state. Umayyad caliphs attempted to balance the powers and privileges of both factions, but the rivalry smoldered until the Third Muslim Civil War, in which the Yaman killed Caliph Walid II for his dependence on the Qays. Yamani opposition continued under Caliph Marwan II, and the Yaman ultimately defected to the Abbasids when the latter conquered the Umayyad realm in 750. The Yaman and Qays briefly joined forces against the Abbasids later that year, but were defeated. The Qays‚ÄìYaman rivalry diminished significantly under the Abbasids who, unlike the Umayyads, did not derive the bulk of their military support from either faction. Nonetheless, the feud persisted at the local level to varying degrees in the following centuries, which saw occasional outbreaks of Qaysi‚ÄìYamani violence. During the Ottoman era, between the 16th and mid-19th centuries, the rivalry saw a resurgence in Mount Lebanon and Palestine, and affiliation with either faction transcended ethnicity and religion and was made by families with little consideration to genuine tribal lineage. In Mount Lebanon, the feud was mostly fought out between different Druze clans until the Battle of Ain Dara in 1711 led to the near complete exodus of Yamani Druze. Across Palestine, the rivalry encompassed Bedouin tribesmen, peasant clans and townsfolk. Most actual fighting took place in Nablus and its hinterland and the area around Jerusalem. The feud gradually dissipated with the growth of Ottoman centralization in the mid-19th century. Origins =Genealogical differences= The ancient origins of the Qays‚ÄìYaman division were traditionally based on an Arab tribe's northern or southern Arabian roots, real or perceived; the Qays were from northern Arabia, while the Yaman were from southern Arabia.Irwin 2003, p. 253. Genealogically, the northern tribes were traditionally said to descend from Ishmael while the southern tribes were said to descend from Qahtan.Crone 1994, p. 2. Historical Arab sources sometimes referred to the southern Arabs as QahtƒÅniyya (Qahtanites), but more often called them ahl al-Yaman (people of Yemen) or al-YamƒÅniyya (Yemenites). By contrast, northern Arabs were seldom referred to as \\"Ishmaelites\\", possibly because that term came to refer to Arabs in general. Rather, the northerners were described as Adnanites after Adnan, a distant descendant of Ishmael, or called after one of the descendants of Adnan, namely his son Nizar (NizƒÅriyya), the latter's son Mudar (Mu·∏çariyya), or one of Mudar's descendants, Qays (Qaysiyya). Moreover, not all of the northern Arabs came under the labels \\"Mudar\\" or \\"Qays\\"; the Rabi'ah, whose traditional homeland was eastern Arabia, also traced their descent to Nizar. However, regardless of their northern ancestry, the Rabi'ah's allegiance vacillated between Qays/Mudar and Yaman, and historical Arab sources often referred to them as a third party to the Qays‚ÄìYaman feud. This north-south distinction existed among the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula since pre-Islamic times (before the 7th century).Patai, p. 15. However, there is no mention of hostility between the two groupings in pre-Islamic Arab tradition.Crone 1994, pp. 2‚Äì3. The Qays did not function as a tribal confederation before the advent of Islam, and in ancient Arab histories, the tribes that would form the confederation were mentioned individually rather than as a collective.Watt 1991, p. 834. According to historian W. Montgomery Watt, it was during the Umayyad era (638‚Äì750), that the Arab tribes began organizing themselves along northern (Qaysi) and southern (Yamani) lines \\"so as to constitute something like a political party\\". The rivalry between Yaman and Qays may have stemmed from competition over grazing rights in Syria following the conquest. However, open conflict between them occurred only during the Second Muslim Civil War (680‚Äì692).Crone 1994, p. 3. =Geographical distribution= Filastin, al- Urdunn and Hims, while the Qays inhabited al-Jazirah, the Byzantine frontier and Qinnasrin During the Umayyad and Abbasid eras, one of the bases of the Qays‚ÄìYaman division was geographical. Syria was divided into five military- administrative districts (ajnad; sing. jund): Filastin centered around Ramla; al-Urdunn centered around Tiberias; Dimashq centered around Damascus; Hims centered around Hims; and Qinnasrin centered around Chalcis.Cobb, p. 11‚Äì12. Traditionally, it is held that the Yamani tribes inhabited the southern ajnad of Syria, namely Filastin and al-Urdunn, \\"but the reality was more complex\\", according to historian Paul M. Cobb.Cobb, p. 13. Al-Urdunn was clearly dominated by the Yaman, particularly the Ash'ar tribe, but Filastin was an abode for Yamani and Qaysi tribes, who viewed the district as particularly profitable.Gil, p. 133. By the end of the Umayyad era, however, Yaman apparently was the predominant faction in Filastin. The tribes of Dimashq, which included the regions of Ghutah, Hawran and Transjordan and was even more profitable than Filastin, were predominantly Yamani, though a significant Qaysi minority existed. The Yaman also dominated Hims, including the Palmyrene steppe, while the Qays dominated Qinnasrin, along with Upper Mesopotamia (known by Arabs as al-Jazirah) and the Byzantine frontier as far as Armenia. Some of the Yamani tribes, including the Kalb, Tanukh, and Judham, had settled in Syria prior to the 7th-century Muslim conquest. Well-established in their regions, many of the Yamani tribes formed alliances with the Byzantine Empire, which controlled the region prior to the Muslim conquest, and embraced Christianity;Rihan 2014, p. 179. some sections of certain Yamani tribes remained Christian following the Muslim conquest.Kennedy, p. 80. Many of the Qays tribes, particularly the Kilab, Sulaym and Uqayl, were moved to Upper Mesopotamia from Arabia by the Umayyad caliph, Mu'awiyah (r. 661‚Äì680). At the same time, a number of Yamani tribes in Mu'awiyah's army, such as the Kindah and the Hadhrami, joined other established Yamani tribes around Homs.Kennedy, pp. 79‚Äì80. Meanwhile, the Qays/Mudar‚ÄìYaman conflict in Iraq, specifically Basra, was rooted in the mass migration of southern Azd tribesmen from Oman to Basra just prior to the Second Muslim Civil War.Hawting 2000, p. 54. Before then, Basra was dominated by northern tribesmen from the Mudar facton, led by the Tamim tribe, and the Rabi'ah faction. The Azd became allies with Rabi'ah, despite the latter's northern roots. With this, the \\"parties had been formed for future conflict\\", according to historian G. R. Hawting. Moreover, because the Arab troops of Khurasan came from the Basra garrison, the Qays/Mudar‚ÄìYaman conflict carried over into that vast eastern province of the caliphate. The migration of Qaysi tribes to northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia and of the Yamani Azd to Basra upset the tribal balance of power in these regions, which significantly influenced the Qays/Mudar‚ÄìYaman feud.Hawting 2000, p. 55. Umayyad era =Battle of Marj Rahit= It is likely the Qays and Yaman factions firmly took shape after Mu'awiyah I's reign; previously, differences between Qaysi and Yamani tribes were \\"fairly harmless\\", according to historian Hugh N. Kennedy.Kennedy, p. 79. Mu'awiyah's reliance on Kalb troops and his son Yazid's mother being Kalbi caused unease among Qays chieftains. Meanwhile, political disarray spread throughout the caliphate in the wake of Caliph Yazid's death in 683 and his successor Mu'awiyah II several weeks later.Kennedy 2004, pp. 77‚Äì78. There were no obvious successors among the ruling Sufyanid branch of the Umayyad dynasty, which the Kalb were determined to preserve so as to maintain the administrative and military privileges they acquired under them.Kennedy 2004, p. 78 Thus, the Kalb's chieftain, Hassan ibn Malik ibn Bahdal, assembled the representatives of the Yamani tribes of Syria for a shura (council) in Jabiyah wherein they chose an Umayyad outsider, Marwan (r. 684‚Äì685), to be the next caliph;Kennedy 2004, pp. 78‚Äì79. Marwan made significant political concessions to the Kalb, which drove the Qays, led by the governor of Damascus, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, to back Abdullah ibn Zubayr's claim to the caliphate. Marwan and the Kalb set up camp at Marj Rahit, overlooking al-Dahhak's Damascus headquarters, and were soon joined by the Yamani Ghassanids and Kindah.Hawting, p. 59. Other Yamani tribes that joined Marwan were the Tayy, al-Qayn and Tanukh.Hawting, pp. 60‚Äì61. As the Qays under al-Dahhak marched toward Marwan's camp, a Ghassanid scion, Yazid ibn Abi al-Nims, led a revolt in Damascus that drove al-Dahhak's men out of the city.Hawting, pp. 59-60. The two factions then fought at the Battle of Marj Rahit, which lasted twenty days, beginning on 18 August 684. The far more numerous Qays were routed and many of them were killed as they retreated, including al-Dahhak and eighty other Qaysi notables. The survivors among the Qays, led by Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi of 'Amir, fled north to the Euphrates town of al-Qarqisiyah, while Marwan was made caliph in Damascus. The Battle of Marj Rahit firmly divided the Arab tribes of Syria into Yaman or Qays. According to Kennedy, the \\"Qays had many dead to avenge and the feud was to continue for generations\\", while Marwan \\"would be entirely dependent on the ... Yamani tribes who had elected him\\". Indeed, the Yaman helped Marwan assert his rule in Egypt and smoothly managed the accession of his son, Abd al-Malik (r. 685‚Äì705), following Marwan's death in 685. The Yamani leaders, Ibn Bahdal of Kalb and Rawh ibn Zinba of Judham, were Abd al-Malik's main supporters, other than his kinsmen. All the while, the Qays in Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria under Zufar's leadership remained steadfastly behind Ibn Zubayr, and stymied the expansion of Umayyad authority to Zubayrid-held Iraq.Kennedy 2004, p. 81. =Ayyam raids= Caliph Abd al-Malik (685‚Äì705), depicted on this gold dinar issued by him, struggled to keep peace between the Qays and Yaman. Following Marj Rahit, the Qays initiated a series of raids and counter-raids against the Yaman,Wellhausen 1927, p. 201. particularly the latter's leading faction, the Kalb.Wellhausen 1927, p. 202. Because each confrontation was typically a day-long, the raids were referred to by medieval Arab sources as ayyƒÅm (days; sing. yawm), with each yawm named after the place where the attack occurred.Dixon 1991, p. 493. The sources of the ayyƒÅm battles were contemporary Arab poems and stories that were preserved in the Kitab al- Aghani, Kitab al-Hamasah and the histories of al-Mada'ini (d. ca. 843) and Ibn al-Athir (d. 1233). Historian Julius Wellhausen asserts that \\"the accounts are mostly quite reliable, though partly without connection and chronology\\". The cycle of raids began following the battlefield defection of the Qaysi general and Sulaym chieftain, Umayr ibn al-Hubab, from the Ummayad army during the Battle of Khazir against the pro-Alid forces of al-Mukhtar in 686. The defection of Umayr and his troops, who took refuge with Zufar in al- Qarqisiyah, was blamed for the rout of the Umayyad force. Though the exact year is not available in contemporary sources, the first ayyƒÅm raid was carried out by Zufar against a Kalb encampment at Musaiyakh in the environs of Hims, in which twenty Kalb tribesmen were killed. The Kalb, led by Humayd ibn Hurayth ibn Bahdal, responded by killing sixty men from the Qaysi tribe of Numayr living among the Kalb in Palmyra. Afterward, Umayr led an assault on Iklil, in the vicinity of Palmyra, that killed between 500 and 1,000 Kalb tribesmen. Umayr evaded Humayd's pursuit and made it back to al- Qarqisiyah.Wellhausen 1927, p. 203. Umayr followed up on his victory by leading several damaging raids against the Kalb in their dwelling places in the Samawah desert, including at a well named Kaaba, in which Humayd was nearly killed. The Kalb in Samawah ultimately fled for the Jordan Valley in Palestine as a result of the attacks. Umayr later settled his Sulaym tribesmen along the Khabur River, where they encroached on the grazing lands of the Taghlib. The latter, a Christian tribe belonging to the Rabi'ah,Stetkevych 2002, p. 85. had settlements stretching from the Khabur eastward beyond the Tigris River. The Taghlib requested Zufar's intervention to evict the Sulaym but Zufar was unable to mediate the dispute.Wellhausen 1927, pp. 203-204. Instead, Umayr received sanction from the Zubayrids to assault the Taghlib, and with a large force he massacred numerous Taghlib tribesmen at the Khabur village of Makisin.Wellhausen 1927, p. 204. Further Qaysi-Taghlib skirmishes, which also dragged in Zufar on the side of Umayr, took place along the Khabur, Tigris, Balikh and Tharthar rivers. In 689, the Taghlib ambushed the Qays at the Tharthar village of al-Hashshak, near Tikrit.Bell 1903, p. 210. The ensuing battle lasted three days, and towards the end, Zufar and his 'Amir kinsmen retreated to al-Qarqisiyah and abandoned Umayr, who was ultimately killed by the Taghlib.Marsham 2009, p. 104. The latter sent Umayr's head to Abd al-Malik. Obliged to avenge the death of his Qaysi comrade, Zufar retaliated against the Taghlib, dealing them a heavy blow at the Tigris village of Kuhail.Wellhausen 1927, pp. 204-205. Afterward, he executed 200 captured Taghlib tribesmen. In 691, Abd al-Malik's siege of al-Qarqisiyah pushed Zufar to accept a negotiated surrender to Umayyad authority. Per the agreement, Abd al-Malik incorporated Qaysi tribesmen into the Umayyad court and army.Kennedy 2004, p. 84. The entry of Qays into the reconstituted Umayyad army of Syria ended Yamani, and specifically Kalbi, monopolization of that institution; from then on Abd al-Malik sought to balance each faction's interest within the military.Kennedy 2004, pp. 86‚Äì87. Abd al-Malik's forces also defeated the Umayyads' Zubayrid rivals and patrons of the Qays, Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr in Iraq in October 691 and Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca in September 692.Stetkevych 2002, pp. 85‚Äì86. These developments put an end to Qaysi attacks against the Taghlib.Wellhausen 1927, p. 205. Around this time, the Taghlib's celebrated poet and representative to the Umayyad court, al- Akhtal, recited a poem to Abd al-Malik boasting of the victory over Qays and their surrender to Abd al-Malik: > (Thanks to us) the men of Qays came forth hastening to pledge allegiance to > you [Abd al-Malik] publicly after long denial. > May God never lead Qays back from their error; and may no one say 'Take > care!' when they stumble ... > ... They [Qays] lived in blessed abundance till they were caught in Satan's > [Ibn Zubayr's] snares. > ‚Äî Al-Akhtal, circa 691/92. Despite Abd al-Malik's accord with the Qays, the two camps continued to attack each other.Kennedy 2004, p. 87. Thereafter, the battles spread to the Hejaz and Iraq, unlike most of the early confrontations, which occurred in Upper Mesopotamia and the Palmyrene steppe. Thus, the Qays‚ÄìYaman conflict broke out of its Syrian confines and into the wider Islamic world. Humayd still sought revenge for prior losses the Kalb suffered at the hands of the 'Amir and Sulaym, but since those two tribes were now under Abd al-Malik's protection, Humayd resolved to attack the Qaysi tribe of Fazara. The latter mainly lived east of Medina, but their ruling clan inhabited Kufa. They were not previously involved in attacks against the Yaman. Humayd acquired a warrant from the Umayyad prince, Khalid ibn Yazid, to collect the cattle tax from the Fazara on behalf of Abd al-Malik's government. Using this legal cover, Humayd led a large expeditionary force of Kalbi clans against Fazara tribesmen in Iraq, killing and wounding many, particularly at a place called '√Çh.Wellhausen 1927, p. 206. The Fazara protested these assaults to Abd al-Malik, who responded by paying them blood money, which the Fazara, in turn, used to purchase weaponry and horses. In circa 692/93, the Fazara retaliated against the Kalb in a surprise attack against their encampment at the Banat Qain wells in the Samawah, which ended with the deaths of 69 Kalb tribesmen. The raid on Banat Qayn was the most celebrated of the ayyam between Qays and Kalb. Infuriated at the Fazara's attack, Abd al-Malik ordered his general al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf to lead an expedition against the Fazara. However, the two main Fazara commanders from Banat Qain, Sa'id ibn Uyaynah and Halhalah ibn Qays, surrendered themselves to avert a military assault against their tribe. The Fazara commanders were then executed to satisfy the Kalb, who accepted it as a compensation for their losses. =Tribal balancing in the state= Abd al- Malik's ability to end Qaysi‚ÄìYamani violence was mostly limited to issuing threats or paying blood money. Though he succeeded in transforming the Umayyad Caliphate into a centralized, bureaucratic state with decreasing reliance on the Syrian army, Kennedy notes that the \\"Qays‚ÄìYaman feud illustrated the problems of transition\\" in the caliphate from nomadism to settled life and governance. After 691, each faction became associated with an Umayyad prince; the Qays allied themselves with Abd al-Malik's brother and governor of Upper Mesopotamia, Muhammad ibn Marwan, while the Yaman were associated with Abd al- Malik's Palestine-based son, Sulayman.Kennedy 2004, p. 86. These affiliations played an important role during future intra-Umayyad rivalry. After the accession of al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715), Qaysi‚ÄìYamani tensions simmered, but did not result in serious conflict.Kennedy 2004, p. 90. Al-Walid, whose mother Wallada was Qaysi, afforded the Qays a degree of privilege. Nonetheless, the Yaman held significant influence with other branches of the Umayyad household, namely with Sulayman, but also Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, who maintained the ties his father established with Yamani army leaders in Egypt. Moreover, with the accession of Sulayman in 715, the Yamani general Raja ibn Haywa of Kindah became his chief adviser and the Yaman regained their advantageous position within the Umayyad state.Kennedy 2004, p. 91. There is disagreement among historians over the basis of the Qays‚ÄìYaman conflict during and after Sulayman's reign. Medieval Arab sources describe the conflict mainly as a tribal rivalry. M. A. Shaban asserts that the Qays came to represent the policies of Islamic expansionism and Arab governmental monopolization embraced by Abd al-Malik and the powerful governor al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, while the Yaman supported stabilizing the caliphate's borders and assimilating non-Arabs into the state. The Yaman's allies and successive caliphs, Sulayman (r. 715‚Äì717) and Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (717‚Äì720), pursued such policies. Kennedy argues against Shaban's theory, instead holding that the conflict \\"was between two factions based on tribal loyalties, which sought to control access to military power and the privileges that went with it\\". To that end, the ultimate goal for each faction was the caliph's favor and appointment to provincial governorships. Qaysi‚ÄìYamani alignment among the Arab tribes was present throughout the Caliphate and avoiding association with either camp became increasingly difficult for Muslim leaders.Kennedy 2004, pp. 91‚Äì92. In Iraq, the two major rival tribes, Azd and Tamim, became the central component of the Yaman and Qays, respectively, in that province. The Qays‚ÄìYaman rivalry also played out among constituent Arab tribes in the Umayyad army in Khurasan. Though Shaban characterized Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz as strongly pro-Yamani for his efforts to integrate non-Arab Muslim communities, the caliph evidently maintained a more balanced policy in regard to the rivalry and sought to end the tribal factionalism.Kennedy 2004, p. 92. His appointment of provincial governors was based on competence and loyalty to his authority. To that end, he appointed the Qaysi stalwart, Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari, as governor of Upper Mesopotamia and dismissed the Yamani governor of Iraq and Khurasan, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab of Azd, in favor of several governors, many of whom were not Yamani. Nonetheless, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's reforms threatened Qaysi interests and following his death in 720, the Qays helped restore the old order through his successor, Yazid II (r. 720‚Äì724).Kennedy 2004, p. 93. During Yazid II's reign, Ibn al-Muhallab revolted in Iraq, capturing Wasit and Kufa. It is not apparent that he was supported by the Yamani tribes of Syria, and his revolt was crushed by a strong ally of the Qays, Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik. Umar ibn Hubayra's subsequent appointment to Iraq saw the violent purge of Yamani leaders in the province. Yazid died in 724 and his successor, Hisham (r. 724‚Äì743), managed to avoid entanglement with the Qays‚ÄìYaman rivalry, and appointed Khalid al-Qasri from the ostensibly neutral Bajila tribe as governor of Iraq.Kennedy 2004, p. 94. Hisham's reign was one of the most internally peaceful periods in the Umayyad Caliphate, and there were no violent incidents reported between the Qays and Yaman within the Umayyad army during that time.Blankinship, p. 98. Toward the end of his reign and out concern for maintaining stability in the aftermath of his death, Hisham increasingly relied on Qaysi support.Kennedy 2004, p. 96. To that end, in 738, he replaced al-Qasri, who had possible Yamani sympathies, with the staunch Qaysi, Yusuf ibn Umar of Thaqif, and appointed another Qaysi stalwart, Nasr ibn Sayyar, as governor of Khurasan. =Third Muslim Civil War= The Qays‚ÄìYaman feud persisted, but the caliphate remained stable and prosperous by the time of Hisham's death in 743.Kennedy 2004, p. 97. However, this situation unraveled as a result of the policies and incompetence of his successor, al-Walid II (r. 743‚Äì744). The latter left the state administration largely in the hands of Hisham's Qaysi appointees, and his arrest of the Yaman's patrons among the Umayyad family, rallied the Yaman against his rule. Walid II's governance was seen by members of the Umayyad family as so egregious that a section of them led by Yazid III decided to depose him, an unprecedented action in Umayyad dynastic history. Though much of the Umayyad family and other leaders were reluctant to back Yazid III, the Yamani tribes, partly led by the Kalbi chieftain Mansur ibn Jumhur, provided him critical support; the Yaman were motivated by a desire to reestablish their once dominant position in the state.Kennedy 2004, p. 98. The rebels captured Damascus, then besieged and killed Walid II in the vicinity of Palmyra in 744. Consequently, the Qays‚ÄìYaman conflict violently intensified. Kennedy asserts: > It would be wrong to imagine that all members of these two groups were > implacably hostile; it would seem that the violence was begun by extremists > like Yusuf ibn Umar for the Qaysis and Mansur ibn Jumhur for the Yamanis, > but once it had begun, it was very difficult to stop and came to involve the > whole Syrian army and political elite. It was this fatal division, more than > anything else, which destroyed [the] Umayyad government. Yazid III's reign lasted six months, during which he briefly appointed Ibn Jumhur governor of Khurasan. He was succeeded by his brother Ibrahim ibn al- Walid, but in December 744 the latter was overthrown by Marwan II (r. 744‚Äì750), a strongman favored by the Qays of Upper Mesopotamia and the Byzantine frontier zone.Kennedy 2004, pp. 98‚Äì99. The Qays were the only part of the Syrian elite that backed Marwan II's usurpation,Kennedy 2004, p. 99. after which the leaders of Yaman were driven out of Syria. A rebellion in the Kalb stronghold of Homs ensued, but was suppressed by Marwan II in 746. Opposition to Marwan II sparked rebellions in the provinces east of Syria, with Ibn Jumhur throwing his lot with the Alid rebel Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya. Marwan II dispatched the Qaysi Yazid ibn Umar to suppress the Alid-Yamani revolt in Kufa. Ultimately, the Yaman of Syria and Iraq, and the Kharijites under al-Dahhak al-Shaybani, were defeated by Marwan II's forces and a respite in the war was achieved by the spring of 748. However, by December 748, the Abbasid Revolution in Khurasan was in earnest and its leader, Abu Muslim, drove out the Qaysi governor Nasr ibn Sayyar from Merv and advanced westward. Yazid ibn Umar dispatched the Qaysi generals Nubata ibn Hanzala of Kilab and 'Amir ibn Dubara of Murrah to halt Abu Muslim's march, but they were defeated by Qahtaba ibn Shabib of Tayy.Kennedy 2004, p. 100. Iraq, with the exception of Qaysi-held Wasit, was conquered by the Abbasids under as-Saffah (r. 750‚Äì754) in October 749. Qaysi troops rallied behind Marwan II as he advanced against the Abbasids, but he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Zab in February 750; Umayyad power all but diminished as a result. When the Abbasid army reached Damascus in pursuit of Marwan II, Yamani tribesmen facilitated their entry into the city. Post-Umayyad period Though the Abbasid Revolution was \\"hotly pro-Yaman and anti-Qays\\", once the Abbasids consolidated power they \\"took up the tribal balancing policy of the defunct Umayyad regime\\", according to historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship.Blankinship 1994, p. 99. Much of the Qaysi leaders of Upper Mesopotamia and the Byzantine and Armenian frontiers, including Marwan's close ally, Ishaq ibn Muslim of Uqayl, eventually embraced the Abbasids.Kennedy 2004, p. 111. However, in the immediate aftermath of the Abbasid annexation of Syria in 750, the Qays of Qinnasrin led by Abu al-Ward and the Yaman of Hims and Palmyra led by the Umayyad nobleman Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani launched a revolt to reinstate Umayyad rule.Cobb, pp. 47‚Äì48. However, the Qaysi‚ÄìYamani coalition was defeated relatively quickly by the Abbasids, with the Qays in particular suffering heavy casualties. Following the collapse of the Umayyads and relocation of the caliphate's capital from Syria to Baghdad, the political significance of the Qays and Yaman factions diminished considerably. Watt asserts that \\"little is heard of the hostility\\" between Qays and Yaman following the advent of the Abbasids. Nonetheless, throughout the following centuries, Qaysi‚ÄìYamani alignment continued to serve as an \\"organizing principle for all sorts of feuds within or between tribes, clans, and neighborhoods, not just in Syria, but more generally throughout the Arab world\\", according to historian Robert Irwin. With time, the feud transcended nomadic Arab tribes and even Arabs in general; the Qays‚ÄìYaman division also existed among Kurds and Berbers.Irwin 2003, pp. 253‚Äì254. Irwin asserts that in contrast to the scholarship devoted to the Qays‚ÄìYaman feud during the Umayyad era, the \\"importance of Qays and Yaman loyalties in the Mamluk period has been largely neglected\\" by historians.Irwin 2003, p. 254. During the Mamluk period in Syria, nomadic Arab tribes ( øurban or  øarab), semi-nomadic Arab tribes ( øushran or  øasha'ir) and, to an extent, non-Arab tribes or groups often claimed belonging to either the Qays or Yaman factions. Historian William Popper wrote that the asha'ir, particularly the Druze, of the hills and valleys around Safad, Wadi al-Taym and Jabal Amil sometimes organized themselves along Qays and Kalb (Yaman) lines during the Mamluk period.Popper, p. 255. During some occasions in which non-mamluks (those not part of the manumitted slave soldier tradition) partook in the internecine warfare between the Mamluk elite, they took up the Qaysi or Yamani label. For the most part, Qaysi‚ÄìYamani feuding does not appear to have played a role in the tribal strife of the early Mamluk period.Irwin 2003, pp. 256‚Äì257. The division became more pronounced, or at least recognized by Mamluk historians, during the closing decades of the 14th century.Irwin 2003, p. 257. Even then, references to the factional feud were sporadic and do not establish the rivalry's continuity during the Mamluk era.Irwin 2003, p. 263. Ottoman era =Damascus and environs= During the early Ottoman era, the inhabitants of Damascus divided themselves along Qays‚ÄìYamani lines, with the residents of Bab al-Jabiya, al-Shaghour, Salihiyya, Shaykh Raslan, Masjid Aqsab and Qubeibat affiliated with the Qays and the residents of al-Midan, Mazabil and Mahruqa belonging to the Yaman. In the environs of Damascus, the chiefs of Zabadani, Wadi al-Taym and the Marj area (south of the city), and the Harfush dynasty of Baalbek were all Yamani.Bakhit 1982, p. 190, note 11. =Mount Lebanon= In Mount Lebanon during Mamluk rule, the local Druze nobility was split along Qaysi‚ÄìYamani lines, with the Alam al-Din and Buhtur families representing Yaman and Qays, respectively.Baer and Hoexter, p. 834. When the Ma'an family supplanted Buhtur in 1516, the Qaysi clans rallied around them. The Yaman under Alam al-Din temporarily prevailed against the Ma'an under Emir Qurqmaz, but the latter's son Fakhr ad-Din II, successfully reasserted Qaysi dominance in Mount Lebanon until his death in 1633. Afterward, a Yamani attempt to control Mount Lebanon led to a massacre and civil strife, but by 1635 and until the end of the 17th century, the Qays under Ma'an leadership remained dominant. The Sunni Muslim Shihab dynasty replaced their Ma'an kinsmen as the leaders of the Qaysi Druze after the Ma'an's chief died without progeny in 1697. In 1709, the Qays lost their position in Mount Lebanon at the hands of the Yaman, but the latter were dealt a decisive blow during the Battle of Ain Dara in 1711, in which numerous Yamani fighters and the entire leadership of the Alam al-Din family were killed. Afterward, the Yamani Druze, besides the Arslan clan, emigrated from Mount Lebanon, with most taking refuge in the Hawran. The Battle of Ain Dara essentially ended the Qays‚ÄìYaman feud in Mount Lebanon. From then on, feuding factions were known after their leading clans. =Palestine= Qays‚ÄìYaman affiliation in Palestine had an extensive history. However, many who adhered to either Qays and Yaman, including some of the factions' leading families, such as the Abu Ghosh, were not ethnic Arabs, but of Circassian, Kurdish or Turkmen stock. Meanwhile, families that did claim Arab origin chose allegiance with either Qays or Yaman without much consideration to their north or south Arabian lineage; sometimes, branches of the same clan adhered to different factions because of intra-family disputes. Bedouin tribes, peasant clans and townspeople all identified with one or the other faction, including families whose origins were not clear. According to historian Ihsan al-Nimr, the northern section of Jabal Nablus was designated for the Yaman, while the southern part was given to Qays by Mamluk sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1293‚Äì1340, with interruption). During Ottoman rule throughout the 16th century, there were frequent clashes between families across Palestine based on Qays‚ÄìYaman divisions. Most of the fighting was concentrated in the hinterlands of Nablus and Jerusalem during the 18th and 19th centuries. List of Qays‚ÄìYaman affiliations As seen in sources from the 18th and 19th centuries, the tribal division is shown in the following examples:Yitzchak Ben-Tzvi, The land of Israel and its settlement in the Ottoman period, Jerusalem: Bialik, 1955. * The Zaydani tribe, to whom Galilee ruler Zahir al-Umar belonged, was part of the Qays tribe. * The inhabitants of Bethlehem, both Muslim and Christian, belonged to Yaman and flew a white flag. * The inhabitants of Hebron belonged to Qays, and flew a red flag. * In Bayt Nattif and Sar'a, the Qays tribe ruled. * The inhabitants of Abu Ghosh and Dura belonged to Yaman. * The head tribe of Kafr Kanna was called Kais al Hamra (= Kais the red), according to Al-Dimashqi.Le Strange, 1890, p. 469 * Jerusalem was divided between the Husseini (Yaman), Nashashibi (Qays), and Khalidi (Qays) families. * Nablus was divided between the Tuqan (Qays) and Abd al-Hadi (Yaman) families.

A post office was established in the community in 1877. The place name Halfway (historically also spelled Half Way) is said to have referred to the town's location halfway between Bowling Green and the Tennessee state line on the horse-drawn mail route. Though no Official Post Office had existed for many years there- owing in large part to the historical significance- the USPS would offer to make the owners of the local general store, the Halfway Trading Post, Honorary Postmasters. This allowed the owners of the store to operate a small letter drop inside the store, with postal boxes available only to residents of Halfway, giving the store the full federal protection of a building housing an official Post Office.

Petar was killed by a group of Serb officers after he proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in Crikvenica. Biography Kvaternik was born in Vuƒçiniƒá Selo near Vrbovsko. After he graduated from a gymnasium, Kvaternik joined the cadet school, and after graduation, worked as an officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army in Graz, Austria. Also, Kvaternik graduated from the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. During World War I, Kvaternik fought in the Battle of Galicia and Carpathian Mountains. After the war, Kvaternik entered into service of the Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but was immediately retired in 1919 as a major. During his retirement, he dedicated himself to politics and he became active in the Croatian Worker (Hrvatski radi≈°a), an association of which he was a director in Zagreb. During the April War, the German invasion on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, on 10 April 1941, his brother Slavko told him to go to Crikvenica to proclaim the independence and organize a takeover, as the NDH was established that day. Moreover, Kvaternik got an order from his brother to take over the North Naval Sector, which was, at the time, under the control of the Yugoslav Navy. Yugoslav commander of the sector, captain Mirko Pleiweiss, formed a detachment of sailors from Selce and arrested Kvaternik in a post in Crikvenica, along with his associates. In the night between 10 and 11 April, Kvaternik was killed during the prisoners' transfer to the municipal building, when he tried to grab lieutenant Perkaƒçeviƒá, a commander of sailors who guarded the prisoners, but Kvaternik was shot through an eye. Dr. Hajdin, a local official who informed Pleiweiss about Kvaternik's actions, was also killed. Kvaternik's body was transferred to Zagreb, where he was buried at the Mirogoj cemetery on 15 April.

He was a specialist steeplechaser who won the title of American Champion Steeplechase Horse on a record five occasions. In a racing career which lasted from 1991 through 1999, he ran forty-two times and won twenty-three races including many of America's most important steeplechases including the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase, the Colonial Cup (three times) and the Carolina Cup (twice). Lonesome Glory also became one of the few American-trained horses to compete successfully in the United Kingdom, winning races in 1992 and 1995. Lonesome Glory was the first American steeplechaser to win more than $1 million in prize money. Background Lonesome Glory, who was foaled on February 18, 1988, was a tall, rangy chestnut horse with a white blaze. He was bred in Kentucky by Walter M. Jeffords, who died in 1990, leaving his horses to his wife, Kay. Lonesome Glory was originally intended for a career in Show-jumping but proved temperamentally unsuitable and was switched to racing. He was trained by Bruce Miller and ridden in most of his races by Blythe Miller, his trainer's daughter. He was sired by the Irish St. Leger winner Transworld out of the mare Stronghold, a daughter of Green Dancer, a multiple Group One winner who became a leading sire. Racing career Lonesome Glory began his racing career as a three-year-old in 1991, when he won one minor race from four starts. As a four-year-old, he won five of his seven races. In December, he was sent across the Atlantic to contest the Sport of Kings Challenge, a hurdle race over two miles five and a half furlongs at Cheltenham Racecourse in England. He was given little chance, starting a 20/1 outsider, but stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by a head. After the race, Lonesome Glory and his rider were given an enthusiastic reception by British racegoers: Miller explained that \\"there were a lot of people around clapping and cheering... I was a little bit stunned.\\" The win, which made headlines in the British press, was the first by an American-trained horse in a British National Hunt race. At the end of the year Lonesome Glory was voted America's champion steeplechaser for the first time at the Eclipse Awards. In 1993, Lonesome Glory won three races and won his second Eclipse Award. On October 16 at Belmont Park, he contested the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase. Ridden by Blythe Miller, he defeated the odds-on favorite Highland Bud, who was partnered by the British Champion jockey Richard Dunwoody. Lonesome Glory's most important win at age six in 1994 came in the Colonial Cup at Camden, South Carolina, in which he defeated Mistico by a head. In the voting for the Eclipse Award, he was beaten by Warm Spell. Lonesome Glory's most successful season came in 1995, when he won six races. On November 12, he claimed his second Colonial Cup, beating Rowdy Irishman by a length and a half after taking the lead at the last fence. In December, he returned to England for the Crowngap Handicap Chase at Sandown Park Racecourse in which he faced three rivals including the Queen Mother Champion Chase winner Remittance Man. Lonesome Glory took the lead at the last fence and drew clear to win by eleven lengths. His performances earned him $225,7673 and a third Eclipse Award. Lonesome Glory remained in England under the care of Charlie Brooks and was aimed at the Cheltenham Gold Cup at the Cheltenham Festival. He finished fourth in the Peter Marsh Chase at Haydock Park racecourse in January before a muscle injury ended his British campaign. Lonesome Glory raced three times during the remainder of 1996. In April 1997, running on Lasix for the first time, he won the Carolina Cup from Hudson Bay and Prime Legacy. Blythe Miller said after the race that \\"all I had to do was steer him\\". In autumn, he added a third Colonial Cup, picking up a $250,000 bonus for winning both races. His successes brought him another championship, equalling the record of four titles set by Flatterer between 1983 and 1986. Lonesome Glory won once from three starts as a ten-year-old. Undefeated in 1999, he won the Carolina Cup for a second time, concluded his career with a win in The Royal Chase at Keeneland, and was voted champion steeplechaser for the fifth time. Retirement Lonesome Glory was retired from racing at the end of 1999. He died on his owner's farm on February 25, 2002 after being injured in a paddock accident. He was buried on the grounds of the National Steeplechase Museum at Camden, where a bronze statue was erected in his honor. In 2005 Lonesome Glory was elected to the National Museum of Racing's Hall of Fame.

The proposal was never formally adopted by either the Israeli or the Palestinian governments, and has been disavowed by the Palestinian leadership. Publication and reception The Beilin‚ÄìAbu Mazen agreement was finalized in October 1995.MidEastWeb, 1995, Beilin Abu-Mazen Agreement According to Yossi Beilin, who was Economic Minister for Labor at the time, the procedure was merely informal, did not commit Israel, and the understandings were never proposed by Israel.\\"Beilin- Abu Mazen with full responsibility\\". Yossi Beilin, Haaretz, 9 November 2001 The document was never formally published and never adopted by the Israelis or the Palestinians. PLO officials disavowed its existence, but the proposal found its way into circulation. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was unable to give his seal of approval to this proposal due to his assassination just a few days after publication. New Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat did not completely accept this proposal, but supported using it as a basis for further negotiations and for a final status peace deal. Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) denied ever signing the agreement, but confirmed that there had been a dialog concerning the final status negotiations and the existence of some text. Abbas later disavowed the proposal, leading some to call it the \\"Beilin‚ÄìAbu Beilin agreements.\\" Yasser Arafat disavowed the proposal as well. By 2001, Palestinian officials said that the proposal has no bearing on the refugee issue, a position that Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) supports as well. Although the proposal was never completely accepted, some of the ideas presented in it were thought to be good compromises in resolving certain issues in final status negotiations later on. Contents of the agreement In the Beilin‚ÄìAbu Mazen Agreement,Text on JewishVirtualLibrary:The Beilin-Abu Mazen Document Israel would agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state on most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In turn, the Palestinians would give up their right of return to Israel proper and instead encourage Palestinian refugees to settle in the new Palestinian state. =Settlements= Israelis remaining within the borders of the Palestinian State would be subject to Palestinian sovereignty and Palestinian rule of law. They would be offered Palestinian citizenship or could choose to remain as alien residents.Article V of the Agreement =Jerusalem and Abu Dis= Jerusalem's municipal borders would be expanded to include nearby Arab neighborhoods (called \\"Palestinian boroughs\\") such as Abu Dis, as well as the Jewish settlements Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Ze'ev, Givon, and adjacent areas, together to be called the \\"City of Jerusalem\\"; a two-thirds Israeli majority in the \\"City of Jerusalem\\" would be guaranteed. One Municipality would be maintained in the form of a Joint Higher Municipal Council, with two (Israeli and Palestinian) sub-municipalities. The Palestinian boroughs would be under Palestinian sovereignty; the Israeli boroughs under Israeli sovereignty.The Beilin-Abu Mazen Document, Article VI: JERUSALEM, par. 2‚Äì4 and 7‚Äì8. The Palestinian boroughs to come under Palestinian sovereignty and to become \\"al- Quds\\" were defined in \\"Annex Three\\". The Western part of the city, would be the capital of Israel, called \\"Yerushalayim\\"; the Arab Eastern part would be the capital of Palestine, called \\"al-Quds\\". The ultimate sovereignty over the area inside the present municipal boundaries of Jerusalem (as of 1995), but outside \\"Yerushalayim\\" and \\"al-Quds\\" would be decided upon in future negotiations. The Haram ash-Sharif would come under Palestinian \\"extra- territorial sovereignty\\".Article VI, par. 9 and 13 of the Agreement The Parties would guarantee freedom of worship and access to all Holy Sites for members of all faiths and religions without impediment or restriction.Article VI, par. 10 of the Agreement Dore Gold, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, stated by looking at negotiation documents that the Palestinians always wanted to have East Jerusalem as their permanent, long- term capital and never intended to accept Abu Dis as a permanent substitute to Jerusalem. Abu Dis was merely meant to be the provisional, temporary Palestinian capital before the Palestinians acquired East Jerusalem in future negotiations. The Beilin‚ÄìEitan Agreement In 1997, Yossi Beilin concluded the Beilin‚ÄìEitan Agreement between the Likud block and Labor, which postulated that all of Jerusalem would remain under Israeli sovereignty and the \\"Palestinian entity\\" would never have its \\"governing center\\" within Jerusalem.

The battle over an important Confederate saltworks in town was fought by both regular and Home Guard Confederate units against regular Union troops, which included two of the few black cavalry units of the United States Colored Troops. The Union troops were led by Brig. Gen. Stephen G. Burbridge, then commander of US forces in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Confederates murdered both black and white wounded soldiers after the battle, in what has been called the Saltville Massacre.Encyclopedia Virginia: \\"Saltville During the Civil War\\" Saltville Massacre The battle was a Confederate victory. It has become known primarily for the Confederate massacre afterward of both white and black wounded Union troops. Both Confederate soldiers and irregular guerrilla forces under the notorious Champ Ferguson murdered white and black Union soldiers, on the battlefield and later some wounded who were being treated at the field hospital set up at nearby Emory and Henry College. A Union surgeon reported that 5-7 black soldiers and Elza Smith, a white lieutenant, were murdered at the hospital. Ferguson was tried after the war in Nashville, Tennessee, for these and other non-military killings. He was found guilty and executed on October 29, 1865. Confederate Brig. Gen. Felix Huston Robertson had bragged to another officer that \\"he had killed nearly all the Negroes.\\"\\"Was there a Saltville Massacre in 1864?\\" David Brown's analysis William C. Davis, in his book An Honorable Defeat. The Last Days of the Confederate Government (2001), says that Robertson personally \\"join(ed) in the act of villainy\\", although he escaped prosecution. When General Robert E. Lee learned of Robertson's conduct, he communicated to General John C. Breckinridge, Commander of the Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia, his dismay \\"that a general officer should have been guilty of the crime you mention\\" and instructed Breckinridge to \\"prefer charges against him and bring him to trial.\\"McKnight, Brian D. Contested Borderland: Civil War in Appalachian Kentucky and Virginia. University Press of Kentucky, 2006. p. 211 Estimates of the number of men massacred at Saltville vary, with most sources indicating around fifty casualties. Thomas Mays, in his book The Saltville Massacre (1995), argued that 46 Union soldiers were killed. An analysis of the National Archives records by Bryce Suderow, Phyllis Brown, and David Brown concluded that 45-50 members of the 5th and 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry (USCC) were murdered by Confederates. William Marvel had earlier analyzed the same records and concluded in 1991 that \\"Five black soldiers, wounded and helpless were definitely murdered at Saltville on October 3, and as many as seven more may have suffered the same fate there that day.\\" He said as many as two dozen Union men may have been murdered.

He was instrumental in establishing Bombay Missionary Union, and he was the founder of the Bombay Mission or American Marathi Mission, the first American overseas mission station in the world at Bombay. Biography He was born on 8 April 1784 in Tolland, Massachusetts to Elizabeth and Nathan Hall. He graduated from Williams College in 1808, and entered Andover Theological Seminary in 1810. While at the Andover Theological Seminay in June 1810, he joined the group of students like Adoniram Judson, Samuel John Mills, Samuel Newell, Samuel Nott, and Luther Rice, whose enthusiasm for overseas missionary service, presented themselves to the Massachusetts General Association; subsequently, resulted in the formation of American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), the first American overseas agency in North America. ABCM having endorsed Judson, Hall, Newell, Nott, and Price for missionary service, a committee of the board sent Judson to London to inquire the possibilities of cooperation with the London Missionary Society (LMS) like joint superintendence and support of missions from LMS, and still remain under the direction of board; however, LMS declined such an agreement and instead expressed their willingness to receive Judson and his associates under their patronage, instead of joint management. Upon return, the board determined to carry on its own program and appointed the above missionaries to serve in British East India Company colonies like India, Burma, and some contiguous territory out of the British jurisdiction‚ÄîThe board seems to have been unable to point any specific country to occupy. The missionaries were left to decide what field to occupy after their arrival in India; thus, the first overseas missionary program from United States commenced in 1811. Having been appointed as a missionary under ABCFM in September 1811, he studied medicine at Boston and Philadelphia together with Samuel Newell‚Äîhe attended medical lectures as it might increase usefulness as a missionary. He was ordained along with Judson, Mills, Newell, Nott, and Rice on 6 February 1812 by the ABCFM at Tabernacle church, Salem, Massachusetts. Hall, Rice, along with Judson, Newell, Nott and their wives in two different groups sailed to East India Company colonies‚ÄîJudson and Newell sailed from Salem on 9 February 1812, while Hall, Rice, Nott and his wife sailed from Philadelphia on 18 February 1812. Judson and Newell reached Calcutta (present Kolkata) on 17 June 1812, while Hall and others on 8 August 1812‚ÄîMills remained in United States, apparently, to promote and oversee the cause to which he was committed. All the missionaries were warmly received by already operating Christians of different denominations in Calcutta, including William Carey, one of the Serampore Trio. But Carrey's expectations of them were not high; however, they were soon denied residence by the East India Company on ground that they were not English subjects‚Äîand also, United States and United Kingdom being at war, lately. But, they were authorized to go other places that are out of the jurisdiction of the Company. Under these circumstances‚ÄîMr.& Mrs.Samuel Newell embarked for the Isle of France, now Mauritius‚ÄîJudson and Rice got baptized and resigned ABCFM that ultimately resulted in the formation of a Baptist Board for Foreign Missions in the United States‚ÄîHall and Nott, though engaged their passage to Isle of France, an unexpected detention of their vessel made them to change their plans to go Ceylon, now Sri Lanka; however, the arrival of Evan Napean, who was friend of missions and a vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society, as the governor of Bombay Presidency opened a better prospect for them. Hence, Hall and Nott evaded and sailed for Bombay (present Mumbai) and arrived the destination in February 1813. Later, they persuaded the Bombay governor and a vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society to allow them to stay, apparently, establishing the first American missionary station overseas on foreign lands at Bombay called Bombay Mission or American Marathi Mission, commencing the first mission to the Mahrattas. In 1816, he married Margaret Lewis, English woman resident of Bombay. American Marathi Mission American Marathi Mission or Bombay Mission, the first American mission station overseas, was one of the firstfruits of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), the first foreign mission agency in North America. Upon arrival after the establishment of mission station at Bombay, he soon devoted himself in learning local languages like Marathi, and others. When Americans (Hall and Nott) arrived, Mahrattas, originally an obscure piratical race, were dominant in Bombay in the early eighteenth century. For about a century, they ruled and ravaged a large part of India. Upon decline of their power, they were gradually absorbed by the British as their subjects. Americans were the first to go in among them‚Äî Unlike Tamil people in South India and northern districts of Ceylon, no preparatory work had been done for Bombay Mission, except merely that of conquest by a Christian power. At present, Mahrattas seems to stand different to the Christian religion from what they did in 1813. As part of evangelical and missionary work as people would not come to them, they had to go to the people; accordingly, after garnering a group of hearers at temples, markets, and other places of public resort, they used to read passages of Scriptures, explaining the truths contained in them. He preached in the English church, prepared literature in Marathi language, and gave medical treatments to English people and Indians. He opened the first of thirty-five schools in 1814 and supervised schools over the course of his subsequent missionary years. He evangelized the souls of Bombay Presidency and provided medical services, especially in Hindu temples and in bazaars. He and Nott were soon joined by Samuel Newell, who commenced Ceylon Mission, at Bombay. After Nott relinquished his labors due to ill- health and reverted to United States, Hall and Newell continued the missionary work. In 1818, two more new missionaries were added to the station, the number of schools were increased to eleven, and later to twenty-one schools. In March 1826, he visited Nassick, also spelled Nasik as part of missionary duties. When he arrived Nasik, Cholera was rampant in the town; as a result more than 200 died on the day of his visit. He stayed at Nasik till his books and medicine are distributed and set out to return home on March 18. Having already caught up with Cholera, he died on 20 March 1826 at Dodi Dapur, near Nasik, Maharashtra, India, after thirteen years of missionary work between 1813 and 1826. Bombay Missionary Union He was instrumental in the formation of the Bombay Missionary Union in November 1825. This society was formed by the missions of the American Board, English Church Missionary Society at Bombay, those of the London Missionary Society at Bombay and Surat, and that of the Scottish Missionary Society in the southern Concan (also spelled Konkan). On this occasion, he preached a sermon that was later published, and four new natives were converted and received to the fellowship of the church. Bibliography He published his sermons on foreign missions in 1812 and The Duty of American Churches in Respect to Foreign Missions in 1815. He wrote The Conversion of the World, or the Claims of the Six Hundred Millions in 1818, along with Samuel Newell‚Äîwith this publication, Hall and Newell \\"proposed a strategy whereby 30,000 missionaries could reach every person on earth.\\". They further argued: In October 1826, he published Appeal to American Christians on behalf of the twelve millions speaking the Mahratta language in Missionary Herald. He translated the portions of the New Testament (Gospel of Matthew) into Marathi language, prepared a harmony of the gospels, and distributed the Christian literature‚Äîevangelical literature and tracts.

National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 426pp, 2007. The CLARREO mission is intended to provide a metrology laboratory in orbit to accurately quantify and attribute Earth's climate change (see List of climate research satellites). The mission is also designed to transfer its high accuracy to other spaceborne sensors. It would serve as a reference calibration standard in orbit,N. Fox et al., \\"Accurate radiometry from space: an essential tool for climate studies,\\" Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A., 369 pp. 4028‚Äì4063, 2011. making climate trends apparent in their data sets within a 30-year time frame.Wielicki et al., \\"Achieving Climate Change Absolute Accuracy,\\" Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 1829 pp. 1519‚Äì1539, 2013. These measurements may go on to enable testing, validation, and improvement of climate model prediction. thumb Due to funding cuts in announced for the 2012 budget, the CLARREO mission was significantly scaled back, while remaining spaceborne projects were eyed to fill the gap. In the President's FY16 budget request, a smaller CLARREO Pathfinder (CPF) mission was provided $76.9M to demonstrate essential measurement technologies of the CLARREO Tier 1 Decadal Survey mission. That funding will potentially support the flight of the Reflected Solar (RS) spectrometer, which is one piece of the full Decadal Survey-recommended mission, hosted on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2020 (although the Trump administration's budget proposal of March 2017 appears set to defund this mission).  The CLARREO mission concept  Below is the mission concept presented at the Mission Concept Review in November 2010. CLARREO was then envisioned to consist of four observatories on two dual-manifested launches on Minotaur IV+ vehicles. *Three Instruments (two of each) **Infrared (IR) Spectrometer **Reflected Solar (RS) Spectrometer **Global Navigation Satellite System-Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) *Four Observatories, two dual-manifested launches on Minotaur IV+ vehicles **July 2018: Two infrared observatories, each with GNSS-RO **May 2020: Two reflected solar observatories *609 km polar orbits (90 degree inclination) Alternative mission concepts were developed to accommodate reduced available funding. A CLARREO mission on the International Space Station, to include one each of the RS and IR spectrometers, was found to provide the best science value for the lowest feasible cost. Due to the ISS orbital inclination of 51.65 degrees, CLARREO on ISS measurements would not include the polar regions, resulting in the mission being unable to track global spectral benchmarks compared to the version of the mission presented at the Mission Concept Review.  Pathfinder mission concept  In 2016, a Pathfinder mission to the full CLARREO mission received funding. \\"The allocated funds support the flight of a Reflected Solar (RS) spectrometer, hosted on the International Space Station (ISS) in the 2020 time frame. ... The CPF is a Class D mission with 1 year of operations on orbit and 1 year for analysis of acquired data.\\" The mission is designed to demonstrate essential measurement technologies in orbit that can be used to reduce the risk of a full CLARREO mission. CLARREO Pathfinder has two primary objectives: to demonstrate high accuracy on orbit traceable to International Systems of Units (SI) and to transfer that accuracy to other spaceborne sensors. Pathfinders threshold objective compared to the full baseline CLARREO mission is relaxed by a factor of two from 0.15% to 0.3% (k=1).https://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/2016-11IW/CPF_Workshop_2016_Fleming_Project.pdf  The science behind CLARREO  CLARREO could make highly accurate decadal change observations that are traceable to International Systems of Units (SI) standards. For example, at solar wavelengths this is intended to be confirmed after launch using comparison of actual data to theoretical simulations of lunar/solar radiance generated within a high-fidelity sensor model,http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/2014-10STM/Tuesday/Thome_rs_cds_summary_oct2014.pdf although it is unclear how such a non-experimental approach will ensure SI traceability. The Earth observations then made by CLARREO have sensitivity to the most critical but least understood climate radiative forcings, responses, and feedbacks, such as: *Infrared spectra to infer temperature and water vapor feedbacks, cloud feedbacks, and decadal change of temperature profiles, water vapor profiles, clouds, and greenhouse gas radiative effects *GNSS-RO to infer decadal change of temperature profiles *Solar reflected spectra to infer cloud feedbacks, snow/ice albedo feedbacks, and decadal change of clouds, radiative fluxes, aerosols, snow cover, sea ice, and land usehttp://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/pdf/CLARREO_Extended_Pre- Phase_A_Study_Plan_V9.2_no_budget.pdf  Reference intercalibration  Fig. 1. The CLARREO RS spectrometer has the capability to match measurements from other spaceborne sensors spatially, temporally, spectrally, and angularly. This approximate on-orbit data matching is enabled by CLARREO's ability to point its RS instrument in two dimensions. Current satellite-based sensors are not designed to meet the accuracy requirements needed for climate change detection. Many sensors used for climate measurements were designed to meet operational weather needs and are not optimized for climate sampling. These sensors, along with older instruments designed for climate, lack the on-board ability to test for systematic errors on orbit. The CLARREO mission will meet these goals through careful consideration of the instrument design, calibration traceability at all stages of development and operation, with spectral, spatial and temporal sampling focused specifically on the creation of climate records. Then after development of new cross-calibration methodologies far more accurate than those achieved today,M. Goldberg et al., \\"The Global Space-Based Inter-Calibration System\\". Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 92, 467‚Äì475., 2011. CLARREO may serve as an in-orbit standard to provide reference intercalibration for missions like the broadband Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), operational sounders including the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and imagers such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/docs/CLARREO_Mission_Overview_Jan%202011.pdf  CLARREO selection  The 2007 National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey report, \\"Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond,\\" provides the basis for the future direction of NASA's space-based Earth observation system. Missions were ranked according to scientific merit, contributions to long-term observational records, societal benefits, affordability, and technological readiness. The four missions recommended for earliest implementation by NASA were classified as ‚ÄúTier 1‚Äù missions and included CLARREO. The NRC Decadal Survey concluded that the single most critical issue for current climate change observations was their lack of accuracy and low confidence in observing the small climate change signals over decade time scales. CLARREO observations of climate change on decadal scales address this issue by achieving the required levels of accuracy and traceability to SI standards for a set of observations sensitive to a wide range of key climate change observations. Decadal Survey recommendations represent the community's input on the future direction of space-based Earth science; therefore, NASA will continue to engage the scientific community to refine mission requirements during the planning for CLARREO.  The CLARREO team  CLARREO was originally recommended as a joint NASA/NOAA missionhttp://spacenews.com/civil/nasa-langley-research-center- selected-lead-clarreo-mission.html where NOAA would contribute the total and spectral solar irradiance measurements and the Earth energy budget climate data records by flying the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) sensors. The NASA portion involved the measurement of spectrally resolved thermal IR and reflected solar radiation at high absolute accuracy. However, recent events have put such allocations in question. A team led by NASA Langley Research Center, with contributions from other NASA Centers, government organizations, academia, and NASA HQ, developed a mission concept that passed its Mission Concept Review (MCR) on November 17, 2010. Although the FY2012 budget cuts placed the full CLARREO mission into an extended pre-Phase A status, a CLARREO Science Definition Team, which had already been competitively selected, has continued to advance the science and technology development of the mission.  Societal benefits of an improved climate observing system  thumbright Fig. 3. Length of data set required to detect shortwave cloud radiative forcing trends with 95% confidence. With CLARREO transferring its high accuracy to CERES via reference intercalibration, it's possible that scientists could begin detecting the largest CMIP3 climate model shortwave cloud radiative forcing trend 15 years after the start of the mission. Without the improved accuracy provided by CLARREO it would take twice as long (about 30 years). After inter- calibrating with CLARREO ISS/Pathfinder and its newly relaxed accuracy objective of 0.6% (k=2) from 2020 onwards, the resulting measurements may be able to detect climate change signals by the year 2039 (move Red curve to year 20 or \`2020', rather than 0 start point in Fig. 3). However, since this will occur near a decade after year 31 or \`2031' in Fig. 3 which is the NASA estimate of when CERES will detect such trends ' the aid of CLARRE0 (grey dashed line), Pathfinder will likely be of much reduced benefit to climate science compared to the original 0.3% (k=2) concepthttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/49f7/879772831576f66ee85c812b88d7f2490c55.pdf in response to the 2007 decadal survey (with a 2013 launch datehttp://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/news/2008ScienceMeeting/doc/Session4/S4_08_Volz.pdf).

Media career  Pamela D√≠az began her television career participating on a beauty pageant in the show Venga Conmigo of Canal 13, hosted by singer Jos√© Alfredo Fuentes in 1996. In 1999 she gained fame in the Miss Mundo Chile beauty pageant where she came in second place behind Lissette Sierra. A year earlier she had participated in the Miss 17 pageant. While she did not win Miss Mundo Chile, it did help launch her career in television where she formed part of the youth program Mekano until 2000. From this, D√≠az would be very popular in Chilean television, especially for her role in an advertising campaign for Morenita brand beer. She also began performing in bikini photo shoots for magazines and Internet portals. She also ventured into television as a model in the Vina del Mar festival program La Movida del Festival from Canal 13. On May 10, 2005, D√≠az, along with 13 other participants, joined the Canal 13 reality show La Granja VIP, where she would live more than three months caring for the animals and harvesting her own food. During the first week, she had fights with fellow participants dancer Kathy Barriga, actress Sandra O'Ryan and Ukrainian teacher Viktoriya Leonenko. Because of this, the Chilean press christened her \\"La Fiera Vip\\" (The Beast VIP). D√≠az was the first person eliminated after losing in a competition to Santiago S√°nchez, but re-entered the program during the fourth week of \\"playoff\\" only to be immediately eliminated by Kathy Barriga. After the reality show, D√≠az participated during some weeks in a segment of the morning program of Canal 13 Viva la Ma√±ana as commentator of La Granja VIP. Later, she was hired by Chilevisi√≥n to be a panelist of the entertainment and celebrity program S√°lvese Quien Pueda (SQP). It was on this program where Diaz became infamous for being part of television scandals which fueled many publications of the national tabloid press. Her exit was sealed in 2006 after she had a fight with the producer of the program, Natalia Freire. However, despite offers from other channels to book her in their programs, D√≠az continued to work for Chilevisi√≥n, but in the Spotlight program, which was featured in a \\"docu-reality\\" series called Diary of a Bride, which showed all the preparations for her wedding to Manuel Neira, from the manufacture of designer clothing by the Chilean Miguel Angel Guzman to waltz classes. On December 15, 2006, the marriage took place in the church of Santa Gemita and was broadcast live and direct to Chile.Emol, La \\"Fiera\\" fue domada: Pamela D√≠az contrajo matrimonio con Manuel Neira, 15 de diciembre de 2006. Pamela Diaz became more known abroad when she participated in a fashion show in Germany during the World Cup 2006, where she shared the catwalk with other major international models, who were also pairs of players, such as Alena Seredova and Raica Oliveira. In April 2009, she returned to television through Telecanal with just them, a program that was broadcast Monday through Friday and chatted about issues of interest to the female public.LUN, \\"S√≥lo ellas\\" por Telecanal. ¬øHay algo m√°s peligrosos Because of her comments on that space, often appeared in the \\"Top Five\\" of CQC.

However, Channel 13 increased the amount of money and it is thus enters the reality for just 20 days, and who had a contract with Telecanal. In 2010, she was, during the summer, as a commentator on Canal 13's morning shows live the morning and as host of a souvenir program of the Festival of Vi√±a del Mar Vi√±a called freaks with Sebastian Jim√©nez. Later, she came to Mega to pair with Patricia Maldonado in the entertainment section of the morning to meet you. She was also a panelist Look who's talking.

Since then, he has taken human resource management positions at multiple corporations including Motorola, Citibank, AT&T;, Lucent, Jardine Fleming, JPMorgan Chase, and Macquarie Group. In 2006, he began serving as member of the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority council and chairman of the human resources committee. By 2009, Ng became Chairman of the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority. He was later appointed as Secretary for Education of Hong Kong in July 2012. Controversy In 2012, the government of Hong Kong attempted to introduce a new curriculum known as Moral and National Education. It was not well received by the residents of Hong Kong and was eventually shelved indefinitely. One of the reasons why it was turned down was because it was found that the \\"China Model National Conditions Teaching Manual\\", published by the National Education Services Centre under government fundings, was found to be biased towards the Communist Party of China and the so-called \\"China model\\". The teaching manual called the Communist Party an \\"advanced, selfless and united ruling group\\" (ÈÄ≤Ê≠•„ÄÅÁÑ°ÁßÅËàáÂúòÁµêÁöÑÂü∑ÊîøÈõÜÂúò), while denouncing Democratic and Republican Parties of the United States as a \\"fierce inter- party rivalry [that] makes the people suffer\\" (ÊîøÈª®ÊÉ°È¨•Ôºå‰∫∫Ê∞ëÁï∂ÁÅΩ).ÂúãÊ∞ëÊïôËÇ≤‰∏≠ÂøÉÂèçÊìäÊ¥óËÖ¶ÊåáÊëò, Oriental Daily, 13 July 2012 The minister for Education Eddie Ng defended that even though the teaching manual is biased, the subject should not be valued more broadly.Âê≥ÂÖãÂÑâÔºöÂúãÊÉÖÊâãÂÜäÊúâÂÅèÂ∑Æ , Mingpao Daily, 6 July 2012 Honours In 2004, Ng was appointed Justice of the Peace (JP) for Hong Kong.

He studied mathematics at the University of Tehran where he received his bachelor's degree. He was awarded the third prize in the International Mathematics Competition for University Students in 2000 and, shortly after, while still studying in the University, relocated to the UK as a refugee and asked for political asylum.Fields medal: UK refugee wins 'biggest maths prize', by Paul Rincon, at BBC.co.uk; published August 1, 2018; retrieved August 1, 2018 In 2001‚Äì2004 Birkar was a PhD student at the University of Nottingham. In 2003 he was awarded the Cecil King Travel Scholarship by the London Mathematical Society as the most promising PhD student. Upon emigrating to the UK he changed his name to Caucher Birkar, which means \\"migrant mathematician\\" in Kurdish. Research and career Together with Paolo Cascini, Christopher Hacon and James McKernan, Birkar settled several conjectures including existence of log flips, finite generation of log canonical rings, and existence of minimal models for varieties of log general type, building upon earlier work of Vyacheslav Shokurov and of Hacon and McKernan.C. Birkar, P. Cascini, C. Hacon, J. McKernan Existence of minimal models for varieties of log general type, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 23 (2010), 405‚Äì468. In the setting of log canonical singularities, he proved existence of log flips along with key cases of the minimal model and abundance conjectures. (This was also proved independently by Hacon and Chenyang Xu.) In a different direction, he studied the old problem of Iitaka on effectivity of Iitaka fibrations induced by pluri-canonical systems on varieties of non-negative Kodaira dimension. The problem consists of two halves: one related to general fibres of the fibration and one related to the base of the fibration. Birkar and Zhang co-solved the second half of the problem, hence essentially reducing Iitaka's problem to the special case of Kodaira dimension zero.C. Birkar, D.-Q. Zhang, Effectivity of Iitaka fibrations and pluricanonical systems of polarized pairs. To appear in Pub. Math IHES. In more recent work, Birkar studied Fano varieties and singularities of linear systems. He proved several fundamental problems such as Shokurov's conjecture on boundedness of complements and Borisov‚ÄìAlexeev‚ÄìBorisov conjecture on boundedness of Fano varieties.C. Birkar, Anti-pluricanonical systems on Fano varieties. arXiv:1603.05765C. Birkar, Singularities of linear systems and boundedness of Fano varieties. arXiv:1609.05543. In 2018, Birkar was given the Fields Medal for his Fano varieties and his other contributions the minimal model problem. In a video made available by the Simons Foundation, Birkar expressed hope that his Fields Medal will put ‚Äújust a little smile on the lips‚Äù of the world's estimated 40 million Kurds. Birkar's Fields Medal was stolen on the same day it was awarded to him. In a special ceremony at ICM 2018, Birkar was presented with a replacement medal. Birkar is also active in the field of birational geometry over fields of positive characteristic.

He spent the most successful years of his career in Italy, where he created many works inspired by the Divine Comedy and its author Dante Alighieri. CiucƒÉ's art has been displayed in nearly 100 exhibitions across Europe and the United States. Education and career Born in Miluani village, SƒÉlaj County, Ioana Vlasiu (ed.), \\"CiucƒÉ Eugen\\" in Dic»õionarul sculptorilor din Rom√¢nia secolele XIX-XX, vol. I, A - G, p.138-39. Editura Academiei Rom√¢ne, Bucharest, 2011 he studied Economics at the University of Cluj (1934-1938) and later went to the Academy of Fine Arts in Bucharest (1942-1946) and the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Bucharest (1945-1947). During the Second World War he served as a military officer and went on to create a monument to the heroes of the Romanian army at Pie≈°≈•any, Slovakia (To The Heroes ‚Äì 1946). After the war, CiucƒÉ set up a studio in Bucharest where he worked until leaving Romania in 1968. He also taught Anatomy Drawing at the University of Bucharest and was Director of the Monumental Sculpture Art Studio of Fondul Plastic, UAP, Bucharest (1958-1960). He held the first Romanian open-air exhibition on Calea Victoriei (1957) and designed The Festive Column (1964), a 20 m high concrete and stone monument that stands in HerƒÉstrƒÉu Park, Bucharest. His major Romanian exhibition at Sala Dalles (1965), which coincided with the 700-year anniversary of Dante's birth, brought CiucƒÉ notoriety and international recognition. In 1967 he was invited to Padua to build Monument to Dante in Pontelongo. Shortly after that he had two one-man exhibitions in Padua and Rome and was a major exhibitor at the Palazzo Al Valentino in Torino. The following year he represented Romania for the International Symposium of Sculpture Forma Viva in Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) with the wooden sculpture inspired from Romanian folk art, The Archaic Column (1968). Prompted by growing international success and the hardship and lack of opportunities in communist Romania, CiucƒÉ left his homeland in 1968. He first moved to Venice, where he set up a studio and continued to participate in many individual and joint exhibits. His work was widely sought after by many private collectors. CiucƒÉ became a US citizen in 1975, two years after establishing a residence and studio in Long Island, NY. A year later, during the festivities dedicated to the Bicentennial of the American Revolution, his sculpture, Universal Harmony, was put on display at the White House in Washington, DC and still remains in the collection of the Gerald R. Ford Museum. In 1976 a series of 220 of CiucƒÉ's paintings and sculptures dedicated entirely to Dante Alighieri were on exhibit for four months at the tomb of the poet at Chiostro Di Dante in Revenna. He kept working and traveling between Italy and the US for many years. In 1984, he moved his NY residence to Jackson Heights - Queens and his Italian residence to Cappricio ‚Äì Padua. He retired permanently to Jackson Heights in 1989, where he continued to work in spite of his old age. Artistic style CiucƒÉ was a prolific artist whose work, described as both folkloric and modern, encompasses many media. A master at sculpting in polychrome marble, granite, wood, onyx, ceramics, bronze, copper and mosaic, he also completed numerous paintings ‚Äì many on glass ‚Äì as well as watercolors, etchings and drawings. Throughout his career, which spanned more than a half-century, CiucƒÉ explored several themes and concepts. Through his work, he blended elements of Romanian folk art with the more contemporary concept of art's fourth dimension, in which the artist provides a visual expression for feelings such as optimism, curiosity, remorse or fear. A vast amount of CiucƒÉ's art was dedicated to Dante Alighieri, poet and author of The Divine Comedy. Inspired by the beauty of Dante's muse Beatrice, he created countless sculptures, paintings and drawings depicting the delicate feminine figure that would become his trademark. In addition to several monumental sculptures representing the poet, CiucƒÉ created a series of paintings named The Divine Comedy in 600 Images.

The Billion Dollar Gift and Mutual Aid were financial incentives instituted by the Canadian minister C. D. Howe during World War II. Due to its expenditure on war materiel, Britain lacked gold reserves and U.S. dollars,Canadian Encyclopedia online (retrieved 20 December 2012) to pay for existing and future orders with Canadian industry. At the same time, following expansion, Canadian industry was dependent on British contracts and before the war had had a positive balance of trade with the UK but with the establishment of Lend-Lease the UK might place future orders with the US. The Billion Dollar Gift was given in January 1942, coupled with a C$700 million non-interest bearing loan, both anticipated to last just over a year. It did not last until the end of 1942. It was replaced in May 1943 with the \\"War Appropriation (United Nations Mutual Aid) Act, 1943\\" which provided for aid to the UK and the other Allies and lasted until the end of the war. The magnitude of these contributions made them one of Canada's greatest contributions to the war effort. The two grants totalled over C$3 billion. Moreover, the Billion Dollar Gift triggered a strong unpopular reaction amongst Canadians, which was demonstrated particularly in Quebec. The rate at which the money was used was a key reason in creating this unpopular view, as well as the lack of funding that was provided to the other nations in the Commonwealth. The aftermath of the Gift led Canada's future funding to assist the Allies with an alternative approach; one that focused on loaning material goods instead of money. A further consequence led to a change in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and this enabled another Canadian loan of just over $1 billion for Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to share. In addition, Canada provided materiel and services, including things like food, ammunition, and raw materials, as well as things like corvettes, Park ships, and radar sets,Milner, Marc.

He made over 160 Football League appearances in the years after the Second World War. Career Born in Bedlington, Tait was an England Youth international who signed in September 1952 as a part-time professional for Newcastle United while qualifying as a mathematics and PE teacher. Alex Tait was the first signing by Fred Ford for ¬£5,000 in June 1960 from Newcastle United for Bristol City. Bristol City had just been relegated to the Third Division as Alex Tait made his debut at centre forward in a 4‚Äì0 win v Barnsley on 27 August 1960. Tait retained the no.9 shirt for the rest of the season with John Atyeo playing alongside as the dual strike force at inside right. City finished in mid table 14th position in 1960-61 when Tait made 35 appearances scoring 15 goals and Atyeo top scored with 19 goals. Tait scored two goals in a 2‚Äì5 defeat at Grimsby Town and another two goals in a 3‚Äì0 win v Newport County. He also played in the FA Cup 4th round replay 1‚Äì5 defeat at Leicester City. Both Brian Clark and Barrie Meyer were tried as partner to John Atyeo at the start of 1961-62 but with Bristol City lying in 13th place Tait came back as centre forward in October and held the position until the final two games of the season as Bristol City finished in 6th place in the Third Division. In 1961-62 Tait made 34 appearances scoring 13 goals including two goals in the 6‚Äì0 win v Notts County when Atyeo netted the other four goals. In the FA Cup Tait scored in both 1st round ties and then netted a hat-trick in the 8‚Äì2 win v Dartford in the 2nd round. The following season Tait began at centre forward but switched to outside right after four matches when Atyeo moved to centre forward and Brian Clark was introduced at inside right. City recovered from 20th place to finish in mid table at 14th with Tait making 37 appearances scoring 10 goals mainly on the right wing but deputising at centre forward for the injured Atyeo in the final games of the season. The \\"Robins\\" rose to 5th place in 1963-64 but Jantzen Derrick and Peter Hooper were the regular wingers with Tait making only 11 appearances without scoring when deputising for the regular wingers. Alex Tait moved to Doncaster Rovers in June 1964 and then onto Burton Albion in the summer of 1965 taking over as player manager from Peter Taylor. Burton Albion won promotion to the Premier Division of the Southern League by finishing 3rd in the First Division in the first season of Alex Tait's management. After retiring from football Alex Tait lived in Tutbury where he became deputy headmaster during 19 years service at Allestree Woodlands comprehensive before retiring in July 1991.

Railcars can be single cars, while in multiple units cars are marshalled together with a driving position either end. , 23 percent of the rail passenger cars used on Network Rail are part of a diesel multiple unit. Some prototype steam-powered railcars appeared in the mid-19th century, and at the start of the 20th century over 100 were built. Diesel motors became powerful enough for a railway use after World War I, and the Great Western Railway built several single cars and multiple units in the 1930s, which lasted until the 1960s. A 1952 report recommended the trialling of lightweight diesel multiple units, followed by plans in the 1955 Modernisation Plan for up to 4,600 diesel railcars. Most of these had a mechanical transmission, but the Southern Region had experience of DC electric multiple units, and diesel electric multiple units were introduced. In 1960 the Blue Pullman service was introduced using high-speed trainset consisting of coaches sandwiched between two power cars. This arrangement was later used for the InterCity 125 permitting a top speed of . Initially this train was considered to be a diesel electric multiple unit, but for operational reasons the classification was changed and the power cars became identified as Class 43 locomotives. Origins =Steam railcars= Steam railcar Enfield built by William Adams for the Eastern Counties Railway in 1849. Note the raised buffers for use with other rolling stock. From 1847‚Äì1849 William Bridges Adams built a number of steam railcars, vehicles with a steam engine for propulsion and passenger accommodation. These were the Express or Lilliputian, Fairfield and Enfield. Kitson and Company of Leeds built Ariel's Girdle in 1851. However, the next railcars were built in 1902 for the London & South Western Railway for the line from to , although before entering passenger service it was lent to the Great Western Railway (GWR). By 1908 the GWR had purchased or built 99 railcars (or railmotors as they called them), but from 1917 began converting them into autocoaches for use on push-pull trains with a steam locomotive, as these were more reliable and were able to haul additional carriages or goods wagons. Between 1905 and 1911 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) purchased or built seventeen steam rail cars, some running into the 1940s. After trials in 1924, the London & North Western Railway bought three types of steam railcars from Sentinel-Cammell and Claytons. a reconstructed GWR 1908 steam railmotor is operational, based at Didcot Railway Centre and an GWR autotrailer is being restored. =Petrol and Diesel railcars= One of the earlier, more-streamlined GWR diesel railcars, still in British Railways service in May 1956 An early petrol railcar was the 1903 Petrol Electric Autocar built by the North Eastern Railway. In 1914 the London and North Western Railway commissioned a petrol-electric railcar, although this was converted into a driving trailer in 1924. After World War I more powerful diesel engines were available and in 1928 the London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) commissioned a four-car diesel-electric multiple unit using a Beardmore engine, similar to that used on the airship R101, placed in a power car that had been used on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's electrified line from Bury to Holcombe Brook. In the early 1930s Armstrong Whitworth built three railcars for the LMS, LNER and Southern Railway. These had a Sulzer engine driving two GEC traction motors and could seat 60 passengers, able to pull trailers or run in multiple. English Electric built a prototype railcar called Bluebird with a engine. In 1938 the LMS built a 3-car articulated multiple unit at Derby, with two motors driving the axles using a torque converter, controlled using an electro-pneumatic system. Seating 162 including 24 first-class it ran in service between and , but was withdrawn in 1940 due to World War II. Between 1933 and 1942 the GWR received 38 diesel power cars. The first stream-lined car used one AEC engine, seating 69 passengers. This was followed by three cars with two engines for a cross country service between Birmingham and Cardiff, then suburban passenger cars and a parcels car. No 18 was designed to pull horse boxes and with electro-pneumatic multiple unit control, followed by twenty more to a similar design. The last four were built with only one driving compartment so as to operate in pairs with a trailer between them. a GWR diesel railcar is preserved in running order at the Didcot Railway Centre, one is a static exhibit at the Museum of the Great Western Railway and one is being restored at the Kent and East Sussex Railway. First generation DMUs The railways were placed under Government control two days before war was declared on 3 September 1939. After the war, the railways were in a poor financial state, with a maintenance backlog. Government control was relinquished when the Transport Act 1947 nationalised most of the railways in the United Kingdom and control passed to the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission, who inherited 37 diesel railcars. A 1952 report recommended lightweight diesel multiple unit trials, and a memo to the Board suggested diesel railcars could replace push- pull steam trains on 168 routes. After fuel rationing ended, the first order was placed in November 1952 for 21 x 2-car sets built at Derby Works, which became known as Derby lightweights. More were to follow until this class numbered 66 motor cars and 55 trailers. In 1952, British United Traction made numerous 4-wheeled single car railbuses. A Diesel Multiple Unit in 1983 As part of the 1955 Modernisation Plan of British Railways, plans were made for up to 4,600 diesel railcars. The British Railway workshops at Derby and Swindon did not have the necessary capacity, so private carriage builders such as Metropolitan-Cammell, Gloucester, Birmingham and Cravens received orders. Not all units could work in multiple with each other, but the blue square coupling code covered 84 percent of the cars built, using a four-speed gearbox with gear selection controlled pneumatically. Engines could vary in power output from and vacuum brakes were used. Internally the units could be classified as suburban with doors for each seating bay and 3+2 seating in second class, such as Class 118, low density with two doors per vehicle side, 3+2 bus style seating in second class, such as Class 114 and Intercity with interiors to the same standard as locomotive hauled stock, such as Class 124. In 1963, Richard Beeching's The Reshaping of British Railways report recommending the closure of of mostly rural branch railways, led to the Beeching cuts and halted the manufacture of new vehicles. , about 250 vehicles survive in preservation, and various vehicles (mainly 101s and 121/122s) survive in departmental use. Diesel electric multiple units Diesel electric multiple units were introduced on the Southern Region, where there was experience of DC electric multiple units. The Hastings line had special restrictions due to tunnels on the line and special narrow stock was needed. The six car sets had two power cars, each having diesel generator driving two standard Southern Region traction motors. Introduction had been planned for June 1957, but special services were run early following a fire at Cannon Street in London. When the full timetable started 12-car trains divided en route into non-stop and stopping portions. Elsewhere the standard loading gauge could be used and the trailer vehicles were similar to contemporary Southern Region electric multiple units. Two car sets were built for local services on unelectrified lines in Hampshire, followed by three car sets, for which the generator was uprated to . A Midland Pullman in 1960 The Blue Pullman was a class of high-speed luxury diesel-electric multiple units introduced in 1960. Six coach sets were used on the London Midland Region, all first class with at seat service served from two kitchen cars. The two power cars had diesel engines connected to a generators, both supplying four traction motors. The Western Region units had two additional second class coaches. All cars were double glazed and air-conditioned, the first on British Railways. There was a desire in British Railways for faster trains, but none of the main-line diesel locomotives could achieve anything faster than . It had been calculated that was needed, and after the Paxman Valenta engine with an output of became available, a prototype train with two Class 41 power cars and standard Mark 3 coaches was built. In 1973 this prototype achieved , and production InterCity 125 trains entered service in October 1976, becoming the first diesel train service in the world. Initially the rolling stock was considered to be diesel-electric multiple units, with coaches sandwiched between two power cars. Two prototype Class 210 DMUs were introduced in 1981, based on the Mark 3 coach bodyshell with a diesel engine mounted at the end of one of the driving cars. It was not a success due to complexity and cost. Second Generation DMUs The Pacer series grew out of a single car prototype developed for export that used a body designed by Leyland Motors with bus components mounted on a 4-wheeled high-speed freight underframe. Two car production units were introduced into Britain from 1981 to 1987. A 1980s Northern Rail Class 150 Sprinter at Knutsford A prototype Sprinter was built in 1983, based on the Mark 3 bodyshell design. The British Rail Engineering Limited Class 150 with a high density layout, followed by the 150/2 that had gangways between units. The Leyland Class 155 and Metro-Cammell Class 156 were built in 1987‚Äì89 and most Class 155 units were split into two single car units in 1991‚Äì92, (becoming Class 153), a new compact cab being fitted to the inner ends by Hunslet. The Class 158 was built for long distance routes with air conditioning and a quiet interior. Upgraded versions of the Class 158, the Class 159 were built for Network SouthEast for use on the West of England Main Line between Exeter and London Waterloo. The Networker Turbo was built for Network SouthEast in the early 1990s. The Class 165 is a two or three coach unit used on local services on Chiltern and Thames routes out of London and was followed by the Class 166 for long distance services. Privatisation A First Great Western Class 180 Train manufacturer British Rail Engineering Limited was privatised in 1989, and between 1994 and 1997 the rest of British Rail was privatised. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack on 1 April 1994; afterwards passenger operations were franchised to individual private-sector operators and the freight services sold outright. Rolling stock is owned by ROSCOs and leased to the train operators; competitive tenders are invited from manufacturers for new trains. During the privatisation process, there was a gap of nearly three years during which no new rolling stock orders were placed. The first new order placed was in June 1996 for four Class 168 Clubman DMUs for Chiltern Railways. These were a development of the Networker Turbo design already in use by Chiltern and other operators. The Bombardier Turbostar was an evolution of the Class 168 and purchased by Anglia Railways, Central Trains, Chiltern Railways, Hull Trains, London Midland, London Overground Rail Operations, ScotRail, South West Trains and Southern. As at September 2020, they are operated by Abellio ScotRail, CrossCountry, Govia Thameslink Railway, Northern Trains, Transport for Wales Rail and West Midlands Trains. Alstom Coradia units were built in between 1999‚Äì2001. The family consists of the Class 175 (27 units), built for First North Western and currently operating for Transport for Wales Rail and Class 180 Adelante, (14 units), a high-speed unit built for First Great Western and as at September 2020, operated by East Midlands Railway and Grand Central. The Siemens Desiro Class 185 is in service on TransPennine Express services. The 51 strong fleet was built between 2005‚Äì2006 for First TransPennine Express. The Bombardier Voyager family is a series of high speed DEMUs. Virgin CrossCountry were looking to replace a mixture of life expired loco-hauled trains and mid-life HSTs and have tilt for use on the West Coast Main Line. The result was the non-tilt Class 220 Voyager and tilting Class 221 Super Voyager. As at September 2020, they are operated by Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry.

The refuelling process is usually carried out by a qualified operator with knowledge of rail refuelling. The train driver would usually level the train up to the platform to meet the refuelling pipes assigned at measured distances according to the length of the DMU and the refill nozzles. A Rail Refuelling Flyte Coupler is used to connect the DMU to the fuel line. It is a screw in connection with a safety dry break mechanism to stop accidental leaks. The flow of fuel needs to high volume but low pressure to ensure the fuel does not overfill. Usually there is a float arm similar to a toilet cistern that cuts off the refuelling once a predefined level is reached, however if the pressure is too high, this can cause the train tank to overfill and leak fuel.

He then served at Galisteo Pueblo, and was still in charge of the mission in 1632 Early life Zambrano was born in the Canary Islands around 1586. As a young man, he moved to Spanish colony of New Spain, where he later became a Franciscan novice at the Convento Grande in Mexico City on 27 October 1609, and took religious vows a year later. Pecos missionary In the fall of 1616, Zambrano accompanied the mission supply caravan north to New Mexico, arriving before the end of January 1617. An early attempt had been made to establish a mission at Pecos Pueblo, but had been abandoned. Seventeen missionaries led by Fray Alonso de Peinado had arrived between 1610 and 1612, but had been assigned to other missions. Zambrano and his fellow-missionaries may have founded the convent at Pecos in makeshift quarters as early as August 1617. Zambrano was first mentioned as guardi√°n of Pecos in 1619. He probably built the first church, an isolated building on a narrow ridge about northeast of the pueblo's main quadrangle. The pueblo would not allow construction of a church closer to their dwellings. The missionaries were opposed in their efforts by the Governor of New Mexico, the veteran soldier Juan de Eulate, who held office from 1618 to 1625. The governor told the Pueblo Indians of the province that they did not have to renounce their traditional religious practices. According to Zambrano, Eulate protected \\"idolators and witches because they trade him tanned skins.\\" According to the missionaries the governor was not interested in protecting Indian rights, but was only interested in exploiting them. He gave his followers licenses that permitted them to take Indian \\"orphans\\" and use them as servants, as long as they did not mistreat them and taught them the Christian catechism. Later career At some time before August 1621, Zambrano changed place with the missionary serving Galisteo Pueblo. Zambrano was recorded as guardian of Galisteo in 1621, and was still in charge of the mission in 1632. On his arrival there he found that the Tanos were openly practicing idolatry. He was told by a native catechist whom he reproached for keeping a concubine that the Tanos were expecting to soon receive permission to \\"live as before they were Christians.\\" Zambrano blamed Eulate for the conditions at Galisteo, saying he was \\"more suited to a junk shop than to the office of governor he holds ... a bag of arrogance and vanity without love for God or zeal for divine honor or for the king our lord, a man of evil example in word and deed who does not deserve to be governor but rather a hawker and [a creature] of these vile pursuits.\\" On 11 April 1626 Zambrano said that Governor Eulate had ordered a deputy of the Confraternity of the Mother of God de la Concepc√≠on to be falsely accused and hanged because of his membership, and because he was a pious man. He said that due to Eulate's bad influence the settlers would rather gamble in his house than attend the confraternities. Zambrano was still in New Mexico in 1636, and was still attacking the governor of the day.

He is also a docent and a curator of international Group exhibitions. Life and work In 1972 Ringe began studying sculpture at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf (D√ºsseldorf Art Academy) under the instruction of professor Joseph Beuys. Ringe belongs to the Minimal Art tendency of Beuys- students such as Imi Knoebel and Blinky Palermo. In 1974 he modified the focus of this study and became scholar of professor Rolf Sackenheim and devoted himself to the study of graphic arts. In 1977 he was awarded \\"Master scholar\\" (\\"Meistersch√ºler\\") by Rolf Sackenheim. Since 2008, he has been a lecturer in the fields of drawing and illustration technique at the school of design \\"Ecosign\\", founded by Karin-Simone Fuhs. Since 2011 he is docent and since 2014 head of the studio for fine arts (\\"Atelier f√ºr Bildende Kunst\\") at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn. Ringe lives and works in Cologne, Germany. He is a member of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund Ringe is married to the US-American sculptor Heather Sheehan.  Curatorship  In 2014 Ivo Ringe curated together with Viola Weigel the group exhibition \\"Strukturen/Structures: British and German Painting in Dialogue\\", which was shown successively at the Kunsthalle Wilhelmshaven (May 10, 2014 to August 24, 2014) and at the Newlyn Art Gallery & The Exchange (October 11, 2014 to January 3, 2015). Eight British and German artists, whose abstract works are characterized by structures, showed their works.. The artists in the exhibition were selected by Ringe, who also had considered the concept of the exhibition. Also in 2014 (November 18 to December 13, 2014) Ivo Ringe curated together with Joe Barnes and Po Kim the group exhibition Painting Black for the Sylvia Wald and Po Kim-Art Gallery in New York with more than 30 artists from different countries. A group exhibition entitled Restructured took place at the Newlyn Art Gallery & The Exchange from July 18 to October 8, 2016, with artists from the first exhibition in 2014 and newcomers exhibiting their work. The artists were selected by Ivo Ringe.From 18 July to 6 August, many of the artists worked on site in a residency programme. Visitors were able to visit them in the studio and follow live how the works were created. Parallel to this, lectures and seminars by the artists took place. Blair Todd, the museum's curator, mentioned in a video interview that it was largely thanks to Ivo Ringe's \\"energy and passion\\" that this Artist-in-residence took place. James Green, the director, explains in the same video that the museum is not only interested in exhibiting current positions in abstract art, but above all in creating a \\"creative experimental space\\", in which artists can inspire each other. From February 10 to 24, 2018, another Artist in Residency on the theme of Structures took place in Penzance, again the artists were selected by Ivo Ringe.

After 1086 King William I made him lord of the estates of Bolton Abbey. Romille built the first Skipton Castle in 1090 to repel the expansions of Malcolm III of Scotland. In 1102 Romille's lands were greatly increased by Henry I of England to include all of upper Wharfedale and upper Airedale. His male line died out before 1310; but by his daughters he has many descendants today.  History  Said to have come from an 'old and respected family in Brittany and Normandy', it is uncertain where Robert de Romille came from. The oldest references state that the family was located in both Brittany and Normandy. There is a town in eastern Brittany named Romill√© that gave rise to a de Romill√© family, but Robert may instead have been a younger son of Rainfred Rumille from Remilly-sur-Lozon, 14 km from Saint-L√¥ in the County of Mortain. Estates In the Domesday Book the multiple estate of Bolton Abbey was listed as going from the lordship of Edwin, Earl of Mercia to the Clamores of Yorkshire. The Bolton Abbey estate then included 77 carucates of ploughland (9240 acres/3850ha): Halton East, Embsay, Draughton, Skibeden, Skipton, Low Snaygill, Thorlby, Addingham, Beamsley, Holme, Gargrave, Stainton, Otterburn, Scosthrop, Malham, Anley, Coniston Cold, Hellifield, Hanlith. But after 1086 that lordship was transferred to Romille. Finding the Saxon manse at Bolton Abbey beyond repair Romille selected a rocky outcrop in more strategic location in 1090 and built the eminently defensible Skipton Castle page 210Castle Explorer: Skipton Castle Access date July 2012 After 1102 King Henry I confiscated the nearby Craven lands of the rebellious lords Roger the Poitevin, Erneis of Burun and Gilbert Tison. He put those in upper Wharfedale and upper Airedale into the governance of Romille. Clearly intent that Craven become a compact structure the King added in estates from his own demesne. Descendants Robert de Romille's heir was his daughter Cecilia, who married William le Meschines, the lord of Copeland. Cecilia became famous as foundress of the Embsay Priory that became Bolton Abbey. Cecilia and William had two sons: Ranulph and Matthew but both died without issue, so their daughter Alice, wife of William fitz Duncan, was the eventual heir.

The story follows a slave named Jerzy, who is taken into an apprenticeship to become a Vineart. In the course of his studies his master becomes concerned by reports of attacks on Vinearts and sends Jerzy to study with another Vineart. He also instructs Jerzy to search for more information on the events that are occurring, but Jerzy is met with disapproval while there. The book was a Nebula nominee for Best Novel of 2009, and on Library Journal's list of ‚ÄúBest Books of 2009‚Ä≥.  Inspiration and influences  Gilman states that the inspiration for the book came from her agent, who jokingly suggested that she write a wine-based fantasy. The Berengia, where the majority of the book takes place, is based on time Gilman spent Burgundy. While in Burgundy Gilman visited vineyards and spoke extensively with winemakers. Vineyards which Gilman visited in Italy are the basis of Corguruth.\\"Get to Know Your Fantasy Author: Laura Anne Gilman\\", SimonShusterVideos, October 20, 2009  Plot summary  The book begins with a brief history of the Lands of Vin. It is narrated by a Washer, or preacher, of the Collegium, the main religious body. Nearly fifteen hundred years before the events that take place in Flesh and Fire, the Lands of Vin were ruled by arrogant prince-mages, who derived their power from spellwine. To put an end to the prince-mages' tyranny, Zatim, a demigod more commonly referred to as \\"Sin Washer\\", drastically reduced the magic contained in the spellgrapes used to make spellwine. The prelude of the book describes a mutant grub infestation Master Vinart Sionio of Iaja discovers in his vineyards. The mutation is caused by magic, and could only have been created by another Vineart. The plot then comes to Jerzy, an adolescent slave owned by Master Vineart Malech of The Berengia. When Jerzy in entranced by the smell of crushed grapes during the harvest, Malech takes interest in Jerzy. Malech then tests Jerzy's ability to sense magic, and begins training Jerzy to become a Vineart. During this time, the first of a series of strange events occur. First, an unusually large order of healwines is placed by the island kingdom of Atakus. Meanwhile, in Atakus, Prince Erebuh has just received a negotiator from a Vineart on the nearby island of Ekai concerning the loss of three ships carrying spellwine. This is highly unusual, as Atakus, a key port for ships, makes extensive use of spellwines to ensure fair weather. After Prince Erebuh gives the negotiator his reply, the prince's most trusted daughter, Thais, visits the negotiator, who kills her then commits suicide. Upon further investigation by Atakus's Master Vineart, Edon, it is discovered that the negotiator's actions were not his own, but under the influence of spellwine. Malech continues teaching Jerzy the process in crafting spellwines. A few months into Jerzy's training, Malech's primary field becomes infested with rootglow, though it is out of season for the disease. The infestation is contained, but does significant damage to Malech's vines. Then a wagon sent to collect healwines for a nearby town is destroyed, with no apparent cause. Malech begins to send inquiries to other Vineart, and discovers they have also been seeing an unusual number of accidents. In Aktakus, Prince Erebuh decides to completely isolated the island in a veil of fog, at the suggestion of Master Vineart Edon. Cooper Shen, a member of the Cooperage Guild then brings Malech news of sea serpents sighted near Atakus, the first sighting in over seven generations. Two weeks later, a messenger from Prince Ranulf arrives, and tells Malech that a sea serpent has destroyed the entire town of Darcen. The messenger also brings a request for spellwines to cleanse the area contaminated by the sea serpent, and Malech sends Jerzy with the messenger to determine which spellwine will be necessary. When Jerzy reaches Prince Ranulf's encampment, the sea serpent resurfaces, but is quickly killed by spells which Prince Ranulf and Jerzy cast. Jerzy returns with pieces of the serpent, and Malech determines that it was created using magic. Malech then sends Jerzy to study with Vineart Giordan of Aleppan, while secretly instructing Jerzy to find how much of the recent events has taken public interest. Giordan's dependence on the maiar of Aleppan is already under criticism from the Collegium, and when news of the exchange reaches Washers in Upper Altenne, they send Brother Darian to learn more about Jerzy. Jerzy arrives in Aleppan by boat, and begins his training with Giordan. Ao, a trader with the Eastern Wind Trading Clan, notices Jerzy's attempts to eavesdrop on the conversations of nobles, and offers to teach Jerzy how to be less conspicuous. Near Atakus, a Caulic ship attempts to locate the island, and determine the cause of its disappearance. The Caulic fleet also intends to capture Atakus's valuable ports. Jerzy also comes in contact with the maiar's daughter, Mahault, who shares how her father has not been acting normally in the past year. The sentiment is echoed by others who Jerzy meets with access to the court. After Ao and Mahault take interest in Jerzy's attempts to collect information, Jerzy solicits Ao's help in finding useful gossip. When Jerzy secretly tastes Giordan's grapes to determine if they were used to create the sea serpent, he is spotted by Brother Darian. Darian accuses Jerzy of break the Command, and apostasy, a crime punishable by death. During the trial, Giordan attempts to defer all blame to Jerzy, but the maiar and Darian are intent on finding Giordan guilty. Giordan panics, and attacks the guards. Mahault and Ao use the commotion to free Jerzy and the city.

It was adapted from Levin‚Äôs original stage dramatization of the same name, adapted from The Diary of a Young Girl, Anne Frank's diary. It aired on CBS on September 18, 1952, the eve of Rosh Hashanah, to critical acclaim, and again in November 1952. Meyer Levin Author Meyer Levin was born in 1905 to Jewish immigrants in Chicago. He began a journalism career at the age of 16 when he started reporting for the Chicago Daily News. In 1943 Levin was based in London as a war correspondent. He followed the stories of American Jewish soldiers and Germany‚Äôs genocidal campaign. Levin was one of the first American journalists to enter a work camp, Ohrdruf, then Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, and more. He suffered tremendous guilt as witness to the atrocities and wrote of his inability to tell the story of the Jews of Europe. That changed when he encountered The Diary of Anne Frank, the first personal diary to emerge from the war. Levin wrote to Otto Frank and met with him before leaving Europe, inquiring into the American publication and dramatic rights. He was the first to see the dramatic potential of the Diary. The Reappearance Producer Jennifer Strome discovered the Radio Play script in 1999 while researching Levin‚Äôs life story. She met a member of Levin‚Äôs family and was captivated by Levin‚Äôs history with the Diary of Anne Frank stage play. She contacted Levin‚Äôs son Mikael Levin who introduced her to his mother, French author Tereska Torres, and to Levin‚Äôs vast collection of books and films. With permission from Torres, Strome began her research in earnest at the Howard Gotleib Archival Research Center of rare book and manuscript collections at Boston University. More than 50 boxes of personal letters, trial transcripts, and articles belonging to Meyer Levin were made available. It was there that she came across Levin‚Äôs original, annotated script for the Radio Play, a document Levin‚Äôs family had never seen. It is a historical piece of literature that had fallen into obscurity after what appeared as a controversy between Levin and Otto Frank. Strome's effort to restore Levin's radio play as part of Anne Frank's legacy of dramatic adaptations resulted in a North American Educational Initiative, annefrankunites.org, as a contribution to the fight against intolerance. Strome was authorized by the Anne Frank Fonds, Basel Switzerland (AnneFrank.ch) to provide the materials with Limited Use July 15th 2013-2015. 2009 Live Performance  On September 14, 2009, Strome produced a private, live performance of Levin‚Äôs Radio Play at the Museum of Jewish Heritage--A Living Memorial to the Holocaust in NYC. It was the first time the play was heard since its original air date in 1952. This performance marks the first time that the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel, Switzerland, acknowledged Meyer Levin‚Äôs work on the Diary. The Museum performance was followed by a panel discussion moderated by Neil Baldwin, PhD and featuring author Cynthia Ozick and Strome.

According to this conception, the IDF plays a broader role than merely defending Israel's national security. Israel's regular army is relatively small, and thus its strength in emergency is based on reservists, which comprise much of the entire nation.http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Skin;=TAUHe&BaseHref;=DAV/1950/10/15&EntityId;=Ar00102&ViewMode;=HTMLhttp://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Skin;=TAUHe&BaseHref;=DAV/1951/11/25&EntityId;=Ar00121&ViewMode;=HTML Following the Suez Crisis, the Israeli newspaper Davar published the following: \\"Our army is, as is well known, the people's army, an army of reserves, the laborer and the clerk, [as] the laborer and the teacher had one day laid down their daily work and stabilized the flag\\".http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Skin;=TAUHe&BaseHref;=DAV/1956/12/07&EntityId;=Ar00302&ViewMode;=HTML  History of the Model  The model is based on David Ben Gurion‚Äôs belief that the universality that would derive from this ‚Äúmelting pot‚Äù ideal would help create cohesion among members of society, regardless of their backgrounds; this would serve as both a builder of national identity after the establishment of the state, bringing together people of different socioeconomic backgrounds and racial identities. There is also the idea that the IDF is by the people, for the people. The IDF allow soldiers to go home often and also allows regular communication with the ‚Äúoutside world.‚Äù After an initial training period, the formality commonly associated with military service dissipates, which serves as a tool to promote this ideal. One of the initial goals of the People's Army Model is to serve as an apolitical, strong force; in theory, it is the best functioning government institution .  Movement Away from the Model  With fewer large wars, fewer people are needed to serve at any given time. Additionally, reserves are no longer compulsory anymore. There are also fewer and more divisive career paths emerging with the modernization of the army . The melting pot ideal that served as the basis for the model has also begun to dissipate as a strong tie with socioeconomic status and racial identity serves as a mediating factor in army service. Availability of training courses towards certain more elite brigades has affected the authenticity of the ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù element of the army. There is also debate within the country on the definition of the term \\"People's Army,\\" because this suggests a similar intention to serve; however, there is a modern day divide among those serving to ensure that Israel maintains its status as a military powerhouse, and others who serve because it maintains a sense of Zionism. Service Exemptions: Further information: Exemption from military service in Israel Those exempt from service also affect the demographics of those who serve in the army; they are usually for medical or religious reasonings and limit the country's national representation.

The committee was established prior to the anticipated expiration of Tal Law which exempts Israeli yeshiva students from mandatory military service in the IDF. The committee included representatives of all the coalition parties, with the exception of representatives from the religious parties (Shas and the United Torah Judaism parties) who boycotted the committee. Towards the end of the committee's work, about a month and a half after it was established, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the committee on 2 July 2012, after several representatives on the committee withdrew from the coalition, since the way the committee was conducted was not to their liking. However, on 4 July, the chairman of the committee Yohanan Plesner published the committee's report although he was the only one who signed it.  Background  On 23 July 2002 the Knesset passed the Tal Law, based on the recommendations of the Tal committee. The Tal Law set the conditions for the exemption of yeshiva students from military service. The law was a temporary one pending further consideration and set to expire after 5 years. On 18 July 2007, the Knesset extended the law by a further 5 years. On 21 February 2012, the Israeli Supreme Court declared the Tal Law unconstitutional,Court Bans ‚ÄòTal Law‚Äô for Religious Exemptions from IDF. by 6 votes to 3, and that the law could not be extended after it expires on 1 August 2012. As a result, the government established the Plesner Committee. It consisted of ten members, included both Knesset members and representatives of the public. The committee began deliberations on 21 May 2012, and the Prime Minister asked them to report by the end of July 2012.  Members of the committee and professional teams  Committee members were: * MK Yohanan Plesner, a representative of the Kadima party. The committee chairman * MK Ze'ev Elkin, a representative of the Likud party. * MK David Rotem, a representative of the Israel Beiteinu party. Withdrew from the committee on June 28. * MK Uri Orbach, a representative of the Jewish Home party. Withdrew from the committee on June 28. * MK Einat Wilf, a representative of the Independence party. * Yehuda Segev, former head of Manpower Directorate. * Attorney Jacob Weinroth.

Netanyahu's instructions on the dissolution of the committee created a political crisis within the coalition and an unsolvable dispute between Netanyahu and Kadima's chairman Shaul Mofaz.  MK Plesner's report and recommendations  After the dissolution of the committee its chairman Yohanan Plesner published a report on 4 July 2012 which was based on the draft of the committee's report. Plesner stated that he wrote the report himself, and some members of the committee, including Yedidia Stern, ostracized it. The aim set by in the report is to recruit 80% of the Israeli Jewish Haredim from 2016 onwards, and imposing heavy fines on draft dodgers and on the yeshivas in at which large numbers of draft dodgers study. The main recommendations: * The main aim: from 2016 onwards about 80% of all male Israeli Jewish Haredim at the age of 18 would serve a significant amount of time in the army or in civil service. * Personal responsibility: the responsibility for serving the state would be on the individual - financial penalties, criminal punishment and the denial of benefits would be imposed on draft dodgers. * Recruitment age: all people would be required to serve until age 22 except for a selected group of 1,500 yeshiva students. * Service routes: the army and civil service will develop designated routes to accommodate the large number of male Israeli Jewish Haredi recruits. * Community and institutional responsibility: heavy fines and sanctions would be imposed on yeshivas at which large numbers of draft dodgers attend. = Proposed sanctions on individual haredi draft dodgers = * An immediate fine of 7,500 NIS. * An additional fine of 75 NIS for every day in which a draft dodger failed to report for military service. * Cancellation of the individual's yeshiva allowance and of the individual's special income support scholarship which is granted to yeshiva students. * Cancellation of the individual's yeshiva student status at the National Insurance Institute. * Eliminating the individual's eligibility for state support for housing and mortgages. * Eliminating the individual's eligibility for a discount on property tax. * A yeshiva which would have more than a quarter of its students absent would stop receiving support payments, and if at the next check up it would be the same that yeshiva would be closed. * Ministry of Education would visit yeshivas, and if any of the 1,500 selected yeshiva students would be missing from the school, it would be fined 50,000 NIS.

It was established as a unit of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by a Public Act of the Illinois State Legislature in 2008. The institute comprises four state scientific surveys: the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS), the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS), the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS), and the Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS), and the institute also houses the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center (ISTC). The institute has a combined total staff of more than 700 employees, with facilities located on the Urbana- Champaign campus of the University of Illinois, and field offices and research stations throughout the state. In FY 2018, the state appropriated US$14.8 million through the university to fund the institute.  Legislative mandate  In 2008, with the passage of Public Act 95-728, also known as the Illinois Scientific Surveys Act (110 ILCS 425)), the Illinois State Legislature established the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Scientific Surveys Act also transferred all the rights, duties, powers, property, and functions of the Scientific Surveys and the Sustainable Technology Center from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to the Prairie Research Institute. Under the Scientific Surveys Act, the Scientific Surveys are authorized to investigate, study, conserve and develop Illinois' natural and cultural resources; collaborate with and advise Illinois, other states, and the federal government about Illinois' natural resources; disseminate and educate the public about their research and investigations; and maintain relationships between and among the Scientific Surveys and Illinois' public and private colleges and universities. The institute itself is governed by the University of Illinois board of trustees, with its executive director reporting directly to the university's vice chancellor for research.https://research.illinois.edu/sites/research.illinois.edu/files/upload/december17_org_chart.pdf Research Researchers at the institute are engaged in basic and applied research across a spectrum of disciplines including agriculture and forestry, biodiversity and ecosystem health, atmospheric resources, climate and associated natural hazards, cultural resources and history of human settlements, disease and public health, emerging pests, fisheries and wildlife, energy and industrial technology, mineral resources, pollution prevention and mitigation, and water resources. Examples include impact and control of invasive Asian carp, Lyme disease vector ecology, Illinois water supply quality and quantity investigations, geologic carbon sequestration, development of geospatial tools, discovery and excavation of massive prehistoric settlements surrounding Cahokia in advance of new bridge construction, persistence of estrogens in dairy farm wastewater, electronics re-use to minimize electronic waste, and monitoring atmospheric deposition of radioisotopes in North America following the Fukushima reactor incident. Collections and data The institute is an important repository for many of Illinois' cultural and natural resource collections‚Äîwhether archaeological, biological, and mineral. The INHS's biological collections include insects, crustaceans, molluscs, annelids, reptiles and amphibians, birds, mammals, algae, bryophytes, fishes, fungi, and vascular plants. Most collections are also global in geographic coverage for many groups. For example, the INHS insect collection has more than 6,500,000 curated specimens, and is one of the largest and oldest in North America; digitization of the specimens and metadata from this collection continues with support from the National Science Foundation. The Illinois State Geological Survey conducts basic and applied geological research, creates new geologic maps, and gathers and manages the state's geological data. ISGS houses the legislatively mandated Illinois Geological Samples Library, a repository for drill-hole samples in Illinois, including cores drilled for mineral exploration and geologic investigations, as well as paleontological collections. The Illinois State Water Survey studies water resources. Founded in 1895, the ISWS was originally tasked with surveying Illinois waters to trace the spread of waterborne disease and help develop sanitary standards for drinking water, over the years the ISWS has expanded to include scientific research and service programs related to water and atmospheric resources in Illinois. The Illinois State Archaeological Survey curates research collections from more than 3,000 Illinois archaeological sites, including The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site near St. Louis, Missouri. Since its inception in 1985, the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center has been helping implement sustainable solutions to environmental and economic challenges locally and across Illinois by helping both citizens and businesses in Illinois prevent pollution, conserve natural resources, and reduce waste. ISTC continues to be a catalyst for the development of more sustainable technologies, processes, and practices, and does this through an integrated program of research, demonstration projects, technical assistance, and communication. The Prairie Research Institute Library, formed from the merger of the State Scientific Survey libraries, holds more than 45,000 titles and 81,000 items on earth and atmospheric sciences, ecology, environmental science, environmental sustainability, natural resources, and natural history with an emphasis on the state of Illinois and the surrounding region. The institute also collects and disseminates data on many aspects of the Illinois environment including weather and climate, water resources including surface and groundwater, oil and mineral resources, maps and geospatial data, and the distributions of plants and animals including native and invasive species. Public engagement Starting in 2009, the institute has hosted the Naturally Illinois Expo each March, concurrently with the Open House events of the College of Agriculture Environmental and Consumer Sciences, and College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The target audience of Expo includes Illinois K-12 students and the public. The Illinois Natural History Survey's Traveling Science Center visits schools and communities throughout Illinois to offer education on habitats and species diversity in the state. The Illinois State Geological Survey hosts regular field trips to locations of geological note; field trip guidebooks summarize the features of the destinations. The annual governor's Sustainability Awards, organized by the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center, recognize achievements in sustainability in Illinois, in both the private and public sectors. Administration The institute executive director reports to the vice chancellor for research of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the institute is governed by the board of trustees of the University of Illinois. The Prairie Research Institute Advisory Board is the external advisory body charged with providing input and advice related to the scientific and research agenda, management, and funding of the institute. The board meets twice per year, and transmits findings to the vice chancellor for research and the chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as the president of the University of Illinois. History In July 2008, the Institute for Natural Resource Sustainability was established within the University of Illinois to house four State Scientific Surveys (INHS, ISGS, ISWS, and ISTC). In February 2010, the Illinois Transportation Archaeological Research Program (ITARP), which had been housed within the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Department of Anthropology, became the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS) and joined the institute. In May 2011, the name of the institute was changed to the Prairie Research Institute. Each of the five divisions of the Prairie Research Institute has its own unique history, but there is much shared history, particularly among the Geological, Natural History, and Water Surveys, which have been connected administratively to one another and headquartered at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign since the early 20th century. Natural Resources Building, Peabody Drive, Champaign, IL. Dedicated in 1940, and the current location of Prairie Research Institute headquarters. In 1917, the State Laboratory of Natural History and research duties of the State Entomologist's Office merged and were renamed the State Natural History Survey, which along with Illinois State Geological Survey and Illinois State Water Survey were placed in the Illinois Department of Registration and Education. The Board of Natural Resources was established to administer the Surveys, its members being the director of the new department, the president of the University of Illinois or designee, and appointed representatives of core disciplines of biology, geology, engineering, chemistry, and forestry. In the 1930s, the State of Illinois appropriated $300,000 which was supplemented by a $245,454 Public Works Administration grant for a new building to house Illinois State Geological Survey and Illinois Natural History Survey operations. The Natural Resources Building, located on Peabody Drive in Champaign, was dedicated on November 15, 1940. Wings were added on the east and west ends of the original building in 1950. As of 2012, the headquarters of the Prairie Research Institute is in this building, along with many collections and laboratories of the Illinois State Geological Survey and Illinois Natural History Survey. There are numerous additional facilities of the institute located on the University of Illinois campus and in various locations around the state. In 1978, the Illinois Institute of Natural Resources was established by the Illinois General Assembly by a public act which transferred the three Surveys and related units out of the Illinois State Department of Registration and Education, effective January 1979. The creation of this institute was driven by :\\"a growing awareness that the state's economic and social well-being is dependent on the prudent management of our natural resources and a recognition that resource issues are complex and intertwined and cannot be dealt with successfully if the connections between issues are ignored.\\" The legislative mandate of the Institute of Natural Resources was :\\"to investigate practical problems, implement studies, conduct research and provide assistance, information and data relating to the technology and administration of environmental protection; energy; the natural history, entomology, zoology and botany of this State; the geology and natural resources of this State; the water resources and weather of this State; and the archeological and cultural history of this State.\\" In addition to the three Scientific Surveys, the Illinois Institute of Natural Resources included Divisions of Environmental Management, Resource Development, Resource Extension Service, the Illinois State Museum, plus The General Office in Springfield. The director of the institute was Frank Beal. The Board of Natural Resources and Conservation continued to administer the institute. In 1981 the Illinois Institute of Natural Resources became the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources, whose six divisions were the Illinois State Geological Survey, the Illinois Natural History Survey, the Illinois State Water Survey, Energy Programs, Policy and Planning, and the Illinois State Museum. The Hazardous Waste Research and Information Center (now the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center) was established within the Department of Energy and Natural Resources in 1984. In 1995, Governor Jim Edgar issued an Executive Order to restructure the state's environmental agencies. The Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources (in part), Illinois Department of Conservation, Illinois Department of Mines and Minerals, and several other related government units were combined to form the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). The Surveys (now four, including the Hazardous Waste Research and Information Center) plus the Illinois State Museum were placed under the Office of Scientific Research and Analysis within IDNR. The Surveys remained in IDNR until the institute was established within the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2008.

Biography =Youth in Vienna= Hilde Spiel was born in Vienna in October 1911, into a prosperous assimilated Jewish family. Her paternal grandfather had attained a level of prominence in Vienna as a salesman, living in the 1st district of the capital.Vienna Is Different: Jewish Writers in Austria from the fin-de-si√®cle to the present, Hilary Hope Herzog, Berghahn Books, 2011, p. 204 Her parents, who became Roman Catholics as adults,Gender, Memory and Judaism, ed. Judit Gazsi, Andrea Pet≈ë, and Zsuzsanna Toronyi, Balassi Kiado, 2007, p. 90 were Hugo F. Spiel, an engineering research chemist and an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I, and Marie (n√©e Gutfeld). For the first ten years of her life she lived in a garden apartment in Probusgasse in the prestigious Heiligenstadt, in the 19th district, where her mother's family had lived for generations, and then between Arenbergpark and Fasangasse in the 3rd district. She had no siblings, and was a nervous child. =Studies and emigration= After passing her school-leaving examination at the famous Schwarzwald School, she studied philosophy at the University of Vienna, under Moritz Schlick among others. From 1933 to 1935 she worked at the Industrial Psychological Research Centre at the University of Vienna; in 1933 she joined the Social Democratic Workers‚Äô Party (which was banned in 1934) and wrote her first two novels, Kati auf der Br√ºcke and Verwirrung am Wolfgangsee. In 1936 she married the German writer Peter de Mendelssohn, who, like her, had emigrated to London that same year as a result of the rise of Nazism in their respective countries. The couple had met in Vienna and planned to marry in London, but Hilde Spiel delayed her departure until she had gained her doctorate in philosophy. Her final decision to leave her native city was reinforced by the politically motivated murder of Moritz Schlick by a former student. On settling in London they had two children, Christine (later Shuttleworth), now a translator and indexer, and Felix de Mendelssohn, who became a psychoanalyst practising in Vienna and Berlin. In 1941, Hilde Spiel became a British subject, and from 1944 she contributed regularly to the New Statesman magazine. =Postwar years= On 30/31 January 1946, wearing British army uniform, she flew to Vienna in a military aircraft, as war correspondent for the New Statesman. Her declared intention was to 'compare my present life with my past, test my loyalty, and subject my powers of emotion to an experiment'. In Vienna she met, among others, the Czech painter Josef Dobrowsky, the Communist city councillor in charge of cultural affairs Viktor Matejka, and the young cultural critic Hans Weigel, who had returned from exile, and sought out the legendary intellectuals‚Äô coffee house Caf√© Herrenhof. She also visited refugee camps in Carinthia, and the Italian town of Udine, at that time also under British occupation. On 7 March 1946 she returned to London and wrote up the notes she had made on her observations in Vienna as a travel report. It was not until the late 1960s that she translated her English-language report into German, editing and expanding it substantially; it was published in 1968 under the title R√ºckkehr nach Wien (Return to Vienna). The report, according to one review, was a 'self-examination as well as an examination of a city, a mixture of personal and historical snapshots. All written in the crystal-clear, straightforward style of poetical and analytical precision already so typical of Spiel.' In 1946 she returned a further three times to 'the Continent' ‚Äì (Paris, Budapest, Brixen, Nuremberg), and soon afterwards settled in Berlin with her family until 1948. Here she was active as a drama critic for Die Welt as well as the New Statesman, La France Libre, the Berlin Tagesspiegel and the weekly magazine sie. On her return to Britain, Spiel worked as a cultural correspondent for the Neue Zeitung, the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, the Tagesspiegel, the Weltwoche, The Guardian and Theater heute, and also as a broadcaster. In the postwar years she was one of the most important literary critics in the German-speaking world, and promoted the breakthrough of the Austrian writer Heimito von Doderer among others. Over several decades she repeatedly found herself in ideological conflict with the writers Elias Canetti and Friedrich Torberg. Conversely, she counted many outstanding writers among her close friends, particularly the playwright and novelist Thomas Bernhard. =Return to Austria= From 1955 she had a second home in St Wolfgang in Upper Austria. In 1963 she finally returned to Austria, where she continued to work as a cultural correspondent for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) and published several volumes of essays and her memoirs. After her separation from Peter de Mendelssohn in 1963 and her divorce in 1970, she was married, from 1972 until his death in 1981, to the writer and retired BBC employee Hans Flesch von Brunningen. In the 1980s she spent another year in London as FAZ correspondent. Hilde Spiel was a member of the Austrian PEN Centre, and its general secretary from 1966 to 1971. In 1971 she took on the post of vice- president, and after the resignation of Alexander Lernet-Holenia in 1972, and at his suggestion, stood for election as president. However, her election was blocked by an initiative mainly conducted by Friedrich Torberg, who tried to persuade some of his friends to publish attacks on Hilde Spiel. After resigning from the Austrian PEN Centre in protest, she joined the German centre and remained active in International PEN, in particular, together with Heinrich B√∂ll, in its Writers in Prison Committee. In addition she joined the Grazer Autorenversammlung, today the largest writers‚Äô association in Austria, where she became a defender and mentor of controversial younger writers, such as Wolfgang Bauer and Peter Turrini. She also became an active member of the German Academy for Language and Literature in Darmstadt. Hilde Spiel died in Vienna in 1990. Like her parents and her second husband, Hans Flesch von Brunningen, she was buried in the cemetery at Bad Ischl. Her tombstone records her name as Hilde Maria Flesch-Brunningen. Career Apart from her journalistic work, Hilde Spiel was the author of novels, stories and works of cultural history. The biography Fanny von Arnstein oder die Emanzipation (Fanny von Arnstein: A Daughter of the Enlightenment, 1758‚Äì1818), her favourite among her own books, was described as ‚Äòa remarkable historical document ... the portrait, not only of one of the most brilliant and charming women of her time, but of a whole era of European culture and history‚Äô. Spiel was also a distinguished translator into German of English-language novels and dramas.

However, construction delays pushed back the field's completion to spring 2013. Due to the delays, Purdue, which was selected to host a regional in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, had to host the regional at U.S. Steel Yard in nearby Gary. It replaced Lambert Field as the home of the Boilermakers. With Loeb Stadium demolished to make way for a new stadium still under construction, the Lafayette Aviators will play the 2020 Prospect League season at Alexander Field. Features The stadium features a press box, clubhouse, indoor hitting facility, suites and stadium lighting.

The unusual art style variations, give the comic an almost college flair, while simultaneously remaining consistent with the story arc. It was released through Indie Comics, for its first record of public distribution. The plot revolves around an odd girl named Scarlett, who lives in a graveyard and seeks revenge on those who have wronged her. Creepy Scarlett features contributions from a number of artists including Felipe Sanhueza Marambio, Jessica M. Jimerson, J.C. Grande, Ozzy Longoria, Keith Perkins, Nadica Boskovska and others. Which add to the comic series, art style variation, from chapter to chapter, showing atmosphere changes along with the plot. While the list of inking and other artist is revolving, writer/creator Graeme Buchan, and colorist/letterer Jessica Jimerson are mundane to the project, working on it throughout the current three issues. Plot The story revolves a \\"creepy girl\\" named Scarlett, who lives in a graveyard just beyond a small town. Scarlett lives there alone with her only companion Mr. Ted, who she talks to frequently. In the first issue it is revealed that the townspeople have wronged her, along with a shady organization called \\"The Order of the Red Sun\\". Scarlett battles a variety of nemeses and later reveals she will have revenge, on everyone involved in her mysterious tragedy. However the seemingly immortal girl becomes nothing more than a fairytale to those without any direct history with her. \\"In volume #1 Scarlett faces serial killer Pumpkinface and the return of her nemesis Vincent Priest, head of the Red Sun Corporation. We then head back to 1968 as Scarlett unwittingly unleashes a horde of zombies into town and must put aside her hatred to rescue the townsfolk.\\" List of characters * Creepy Scarlett The main protagonist of the comic series.

The siblings were kept prisoner because their right to the Russian throne, according to the succession of Empress Anna, made them potential political threats to the Empress Elizabeth, Emperor Peter III, and eventually Empress Catherine the Great. In contrast to that of their elder brother, the deposed Ivan VI, who was placed in solitary confinement, the younger siblings were kept together with their father after the death of their mother in 1746. In Kholmogory, the family occupied the Bishop's house within the fortress compound, where they were allowed small garden and some animals. They were kept under watch by guards and kept a small retinue of servants: as their father retained sexual relations with the female servants, their staff eventually consisted of their half siblings. By an Imperial decree of 1750, the siblings were banned from learning to read and write. In 1766, their father was offered his freedom by Empress Catherine the Great, but he refused to leave without his children, and therefore remained with them until his death in 1776, by then blind. In 1780, Empress Catherine was arranging for their release and transfer to the custody of their paternal aunt, the Danish queen dowager Juliana Maria of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel in Denmark. Before their release, they were brought to Archangelsk to be interviewed and inspected by Governor Aleksei Melgunov. Melgunov provided personal descriptions of each sibling in his report. He reported that all the four siblings were physically weak and suffered from poor health; Peter was lopsided and bow-legged and seemed consumptive; Aleksei was physically stronger but suffered from seizures; Catherine was thin and deaf and suffered from seizures, could lipread but had poor control over her voice. As for Elizabeth, she was described as plump, energetic, talkative and reliable, and also as the dominant personality and as the spokesperson of the family. While being physically weak, however, all four siblings were described as intelligent, likable and humane people, who had learned to read and write on their own despite the prohibition of the Imperial decree. They reportedly had a friendly relationship with each other, spending their days tending to the garden and their hens and ducks, riding, chasing each other on the frozen lake at winter, and playing chess and cards. During the inspection of Melgonov, Elizabeth, described as the head of the family, described the siblings' life and wishes. She stated that when young, before their father had grown blind, they had all wished to be free, and hoped for the day when they would be released. They had asked for permission to ride a sleigh through the streets, but never received a reply to any demand made. As for herself personally, she had wished to be educated about the manners of the grand world and participate in high society. Now, however, they had lived all their lives as prisoners and had grown to be content with their lives. They had only three wishes; first, that they wished to be allowed to visit a meadow, as they had heard that it had flowers not to be found in their garden; second, that the wives of the officers should be allowed to visit them to provide company; and finally, they wished to learn how to put on and wear the complicated upper- class garments they were provided with, such as corsets, because neither themselves nor their servants knew how they should be put on or worn. If these three wishes were granted, she stated, all four of them would be content to continue living as before. Before their release, the siblings were provided with new wardrobes and household gifts from the Empress, so that Russia would make a good impression in Denmark. When told that they would be transferred to Denmark, they asked that they be housed in a remote place with few people there. While leaving Russia by ship on the 27 June 1780, the siblings reportedly started to cry upon seeing the fortress in Arhangelsk, believing that they had been tricked and would be separated and each placed in solitary confinement. On 30 August 1780, the siblings arrived in Denmark. Because of bureaucratic reasons, however, they were forced to separate from their servants (and half siblings) upon their arrival. In Denmark, their aunt, Queen Dowager Juliana Maria, reportedly never visited them even once. They lived under house arrest in Horsens in Jutland under the guardianship of Juliana Maria and at the expense of Empress Catherine. Although they were prisoners, they lived in relative comfort and retained a small \\"court\\" of between 40 and 50 people, all Danish except their Russian Orthodox priest.Marie Tetzlaff : Katarina den stora (1998) The siblings, being unused to their new degree of freedom in a new environment and surrounded by people whose language they could not understand, were reportedly unhappy in Denmark.

It is generally a systemic disease which may involve the periodontal tissue, the upper and lower respiratory tract, kidneys, middle ear, and female genitalia. It can be sight-threatening, and death can occasionally occur from pulmonary involvement. It has been speculated hola ligneous conjunctivitis may be a manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) involving the conjunctiva. Pathogenesis Histopathological findings from affected humans indicate that wound healing is impaired due to a deficiency in plasmin-mediated extracellular fibrinolysis. Episodes may be triggered by minor trauma, eye surgery, or by systemic events such as infections or antifibrinolytic therapy. Histology shows amorphous subepithelial deposits of eosinophilic material consisting predominantly of fibrin.

The founding principles of Benjamin Franklin University were based upon Benjamin Franklin's doctrine of thrift and self-reliance. The university was especially adapted toward students who had full-time employment during the day. The school gave students the opportunity to earn a bachelor's degree in commercial science after three years of classes in accountancy and business administration. The university also offered master's degrees in commercial science to graduate students.

It gave its name to the surrounding area, which is still known as the Vale of Red Horse or Red Horse Vale. The figure was first recorded in 1607, and in its earliest form was nearly 100 yards long.Pevsner, Nikolaus and Wedgewood, Alexandra. The Buildings of England: Warwickshire, Penguin, 1966, p.543 Various dates have been suggested for its creation, ranging from the Anglo- Saxon period to the 15th century. It was recut several times over the next two centuries in widely differing forms and locations, giving a total of at least five different horse figures in the Vale. The last Red Horse was finally covered over around 1910 or 1914. History of the Red Horse Although the cartographer John Speed refers to Red Horse Vale in 1606,Newman, P. (2009) Lost Gods of Albion: the Chalk Hill-Figures of Britain, History Press, p. 48. the first clear mention of the Red Horse of Tysoe occurs in the 1607 edition of William Camden's Britannia.Carrdus, Kenneth A. and Miller, George W. The Red Horse of Tysoe, 1965, p.11 Camden wrote: A second mention of the Red Horse was made in 1612 by the Warwickshire poet Michael Drayton, while another more explicit account was given by antiquary William Dugdale, who was given the task of recording features of interest around the country in case the Parliamentarians should seek to destroy them. In his Antiquities of Warwickshire Illustrated (1656), he wrote: Dugdale added that the figure was located \\"in the Red Horse ground, opposite the east window of Tysoe church\\".Newman (2009) p. 47. Whenever it was first cut, it appears that this first horse (called the \\"Great Horse\\" by its later researchers Carrdus and Miller) did not survive long after the 1650s.The Red Horse of Tysoe, the Hillfigure Homepage, accessed 16 July 2012 Later soil surveys clearly indicated a second, smaller horse (the \\"Foal\\") overlapping and adjacent to the \\"Great Horse\\", possibly identifiable with a figure seen by Celia Fiennes some thirty years after Dugdale: \\"a red horse cut on some of the hills about [the Vale], and the Earth all looking red the horse lookes so as that of the white horse vale\\".Mercia's Lost Hillfigures, the Hillfigure Homepage, accessed 16 July 2012Red Horse photo I, Hillfigure Homepage, accessed 16 July 2012 It has also been suggested that the \\"Foal\\" and the larger horse were a group of figures representing a mare and her colt.Newman (2009) p.50 Subsequent horses Inclosure Act, but later arranged for another, smaller figure to be cut on a different site. A third, substantially smaller figure, facing in the opposite direction (South) to the earlier horses, was extant in the 18th century, when there was much discussion of the figure by local antiquarians. Reverend Francis Wise put forward a theory, based on local tradition, that the horse had been scoured annually on Palm Sunday to commemorate Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick's participation in the Battle of Towton,Wise, Rev. Francis. Further observations upon the White Horse and other antiquities in Berkshire: With an account of Whiteleaf-Cross in Buckinghamshire: As also of the Red Horse in Warwickshire, and some other monuments of the same kind, Wood, 1742, p.49 while a Reverend William Asplin ridiculed Wise for his theories on this (and other) hill-figures.Newman, 2009, p.19 This incarnation of the horse was both confirmed on contemporary maps and in 1772 measured fairly exactly by Richard Gough, who described it (in an 1806 reference) as \\"croup to chest, 34 feet; shoulder to ears, under jaw to bottom of chest, 10 feet; shouder to ground, 16 feet or 57 hands; length of off foreleg, 12 feet; length of near foreleg, 9 feet; hindlegs, 10 feet; belly, 19.5 feet; sheath, 8 feet; tail (more like a lion's), 18 feet; width of each leg 1 foot; diameter of the eye, 1 foot 2 inches long\\".Hamilton, S. The Red Horse of Tysoe, Hillfigures Homepage It was acknowledged at the time that this was much smaller than the earlier \\"colossal\\" horse.Beesley, Alfred. The History of Banbury: including copious historical and antiquarian notices of the neighbourhood, 1841, p.310 The third Red Horse was eventually destroyed when a Mr Simon Nicholls, the landlord of nearby inn the Sun Rising, had it ploughed up around the time of the enclosures.Carduss and Miller (1965), p.5 However, Nicholls found that the ending of the annual fair or wake associated with the 'scouring' of the Red Horse affected his takings, and subsequently arranged for a fourth horse, even smaller, to be cut near Sunrising Covert around the beginning of the 19th century.Evans, H. A, Highways and byways in Oxford and the Cotswolds, 1905, p.122 Nicholls' Horse, which was regarded as having no antiquarian interest, had vanished by 1910. A possible fifth Red Horse was cut on Spring Hill, some distance from the original site, subsequent to the cutting of the fourth, but this final version had disappeared sometime shortly after 1914, although some elderly residents interviewed in the 1960s claimed to remember having seen it. Archaeological evidence Evidence for the earlier horses was uncovered in the 1960s by local historians K. A. Carrdus and G. W. Miller using a combination of aerial and other photographs, historical research, fieldwork and soil resistivity surveys; some of their findings were published as The Red Horse of Tysoe in 1965. In particular, they located the site of the first and largest Red Horse (along with the second and third) on a hillside called \\"the Hangings\\" ‚Äì referred to as \\"Red Horse Hill\\" on an enclosure map ‚Äì using aerial photographs to confirm the original figure to have been a galloping horse around long and high.Carrdus and Miller, 1965, p.10 Further excavations in 1968 confirmed the figure's outline and the presence of a red clay infill. The site of the Red Horse was planted with trees in the late 1960s.

He represented the United States in swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec. He was convicted of fraud in the savings and loan crisis, along with his more famous father, but the charges against him were later dismissed. His son, a Navy SEAL operator, was the third American service member to be killed while fighting ISIL in Iraq, in 2016. Early life and swimming Charles Keating III was born to Mary Elaine (Fette) and Charles Keating, Jr. on August 20, 1955. The elder Keating had won the national college championship in the 200-yard breaststroke at the NCAA swimming and diving championships in 1946. Charles Keating III is also the brother-in-law of four-time Olympic medalist Gary Hall, Sr., and the uncle of ten-time medalist Gary Hall, Jr. Charles Keating III qualified for Amateur Athletic Union national championships from the age of 13. At St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, he swam for the state champion varsity team all four years. During his senior year, he won the Ohio state championship in 200 IM and 100 breaststroke. After graduating from St. Xavier in 1973, he went on to swim for Indiana University Bloomington on a scholarship. He graduated in 1977. Keating won the AAU National Championship in 1976 and represented the United States that year at the Montreal Summer Olympics. He finished fifth in the final of the men's 200-meter breaststroke. He was inducted into the St. Xavier Hall of Fame in 2006 and has also been inducted into the Indiana University Hall of Fame. Real estate After graduation, Keating quickly rose through the ranks at his father's American Continental Corporation, becoming an executive vice president by 1986. In 1993, Keating was convicted on 64 counts of fraud and conspiracy as a co- conspirator with his father in the collapse of American Continental and Lincoln Savings and Loan Association (see savings and loan crisis). The younger Keating was sentenced to eight years and one month in prison and $97.3 million in restitution but remained free on bail pending appeals. In 1996, U.S. District Judge John Davies overturned their convictions, ruling that the jury in the 1993 case was prejudiced by rulings against the elder Keating at the state level. In April 1999, federal prosecutors agreed to a plea bargain with the elder Keating in which all outstanding charges were dismissed against his son. After the scandal, Keating continued to work as a real estate developer in Phoenix. Charles Keating IV Keating III's son, Charles Keating IV, graduated from Arcadia High in 2004 and went on to compete for the Cross Country team at Indiana University. After two athletic seasons, Keating IV joined the Navy SEALs and trained at the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California. He was deployed to the American-led intervention in Iraq, supporting Iraqi Kurdistan's Peshmerga forces in an advise and assist mission in a 30-man unit. On May 3, 2016, Keating IV, a petty officer, first class, was killed by small arms fire during an ISIL assault on a Peshmerga position approximately 3 to 5 kilometers behind enemy lines, near the town of Tel Asqof, 28‚Äì30 km north of Mosul. ISIL militants broke into the position using three truck bombs followed by bulldozers which cleared the wreckage away, the U.S. responded with fighter, bomber and drone carrying out 31 airstrikes; which killed 58 IS militants and destroyed 20 vehicles, stopping the attack. Keating IV was part of a nearly 20-man QRF that was sent to rescue a dozen U.S. advisors and to assist the Peshmerga, during the battle the SEALs ran low on ammunition and Keating's machine gun malfunctioned so he went back to a nearby coalition vehicle to get a new weapon and additional ammunition. Keating, now armed with a sniper rifle, climbed on top of a building and began firing on the ISIS fighters. It was at this point that Keating was struck by enemy fire. He was medevac'd to a hospital where he was declared dead. Arizona governor Doug Ducey ordered state flags be flown at half mast on May 4. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his actions in a battle against about 100 ISIS fighters on March 4, 2016, in Syria. The award was later upgraded to a Navy Cross, the US military's second highest award for valor.

Described by English mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, the fungus grows on rotten wood, drywall/plasterboard, and plaster in homes, damp cellars, and basements. It is known from Asia, Europe, North America, and Antarctica.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  The fungus was first described in 1877 by the British botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, based on specimens sent to him that had been found growing on the walls, ceilings, and floors of a house in Edinburgh that had been partially destroyed by fire. The species was transferred to genus Aleuria by Ethel Irene McLennan & Halsey in 1936, and later into Galactinia by Irma J. Gamundi in 1960; both of the binomials resulting from these generic transfers are synonyms of P. domiciliana. Peziza domiciliana is commonly known as the \\"domicile cup fungus\\".  Description  The fruit bodies of P. domicilia are cup-shaped; initially concave, they later develop an undulating margin and a depressed center. The outer surface of the cup is whitish, and the margin of the cup can either remain intact, or split. Fruit bodies reach an upper diameter of . The inner surface of the cup is the fertile, spore-bearing hymenium; it is initially white before turning buff, tan, or brownish. The whitish stem does not typically become longer than . The asci (the spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical or roughly so, reaching dimensions of 225‚Äì250 Œºm long by 15 Œºm wide. The spores are ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent) when young, often contain two small oil droplets, and measure 11‚Äì15 by 6‚Äì10 Œºm. The paraphyses are slender, contain septa, and are slightly enlarged above. The species is inedible. = Similar species = Peziza repanda is a lookalike species. Peziza domiciliana is similar in appearance to P. repanda and has often been mistaken for it. Peziza badia is darker brown, grows on the ground or well- decayed wood, and has longer spores measuring 15‚Äì19 by 7‚Äì10 Œºm. Other Peziza species have been reported to grow indoors, including P. varia and P. petersii.  Habitat and distribution  The fruit bodies of Peziza domiciliana grow singly, in groups, or in clusters on plaster, sand, gravel and coal-dust in cellars, caves, and greenhouses. The species is known from Europe, North America, and South America (Argentina). The fungus has been identified as one of several responsible for the degradation of construction wood used in historical monuments in Moldavia. It has also been recorded from Deception Island of Antarctica, and from the eastern Himalayas. The fungus has been implicated in a case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (called El Ni√±o lung in the original report), in which a previously healthy woman developed severe dyspnea and was found to have restrictive lung disease and evidence of alveolitis. A search of her home, which had recently been flooded as a result of heavy rains, revealed the mushroom in her basement, and air sampling confirmed the presence of P. domiciliana spores.

G. Wells published initially in three volumes. The first volume was published in September to coincide with Wells's sixtieth birthday, and the second and third volumes followed at monthly intervals.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (London & Chester Springs, PA: Peter Owen, 2012), p. 272. Plot summary As its subtitle suggests, The World of William Clissold is not a conventional novel. Only slightly more than half its pages are devoted to events in the eponymous protagonist's life; the others are devoted to extended discussions of general ideas, \\"everything as it is reflected in my brain.\\"H.G. Wells, The World of William Clissold (New York: George H. Doran, 1926), vol. 1, pp. 26‚Äì27; Book I, Ch. 1, ¬ß2 (\\"The World in the Crystal\\"). The World of William Clissold is written in the first person, except for a \\"Note before the Title Page\\" by Wells and an \\"Epilogue\\" by William Clissold's brother, Dickon. The rest of the novel is divided into six books. In \\"Book the First: The Frame of the Picture\\" William Clissold describes his general worldview, describing his loss of religious faith and view of human life as \\"The Adventure of Mankind;\\" this part includes a description of a meeting with Carl Gustav Jung, whom Wells had met in 1924.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (London & Chester Springs, PA: Peter Owen, 2012), p. 273. The first part of this book is said to have been written in his brother's London abode; the second part in William Clissold's house in Provence. \\"Book the Second: The Story of the Clissolds‚ÄîMy Father and the Flow of Things\\" recounts the upbringing of William Clissold and his brother Dickon, which was violently disrupted by the suicide of their businessman father, Richard Clissold, after he was convicted and sentenced to prison for fraud; it includes long passages on \\"systems in history,\\" the ideas of Karl Marx, and the development of the institution of money. \\"Book the Third: The Story of the Clissolds‚ÄîEssence of Dickon\\" tells the story of his brother's family life and innovative career in advertising, and includes extensive commentary on the historical importance of World War I. \\"Book the Fourth: The Story of the Clissolds‚ÄîTangle of Desires\\" focuses on William Clissold's love life, telling the story of his unsuccessful marriage to Clara and his affairs with Sirrie Evans and with Helen, a famous actress, and culminates in his meeting Clementina, a young Scotch-Greek woman who becomes the final love of his life. \\"Book the Fifth: The Story of the Clissolds‚ÄîThe Next Phase\\" is almost exclusively devoted to developing the notion of a worldwide \\"open conspiracy\\" of business leaders, politicians, scientists, and intellectuals to establish a \\"World Republic\\" devoted to the betterment of human life (a dominant notion in Wells's later life that is developed at length here for the first timeDavid C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Human: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 285.). \\"Book the Sixth: The Story of the Clissolds‚ÄîVenus as Evening Star\\" is an extended analysis of the relations between men and women, and culminates in his decision to marry Clementina. But as the epilogue recounts, the death of William Clissold and Clementina a few days later, on 24 Apr 1926, in an automobile accident, prevents the realisation of William Clissold's plans. Criticism At 797 pages, The World of William Clissold is H.G. Wells's longest novel. It is dedicated to Odette Keun, Wells's lover from 1924 to 1933 and with whom Wells lived in Lou Pidou, a house they built together in Grasse, France; the text often evokes the countryside of southern France.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Human: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 408. But Wells emphasizes in his introductory note that the house described in The World of William Clissold is not his own home. Wells received a ¬£3000 advance for the novel, and Benn spent ¬£1500 advertising it. The novel received more than a hundred reviews and was a commercial success. But critical reactions to the work were often negative and sometimes scathing, though John Maynard Keynes, George Bernard Shaw, Graham Wallas, and H.L. Mencken were appreciative. Few took the novel seriously as a work of art, seeing it instead as an exposition of \\"Wellsian philosophy.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Human: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 286. Biographer David Smith called The World of William Clissold \\"a watershed book in H.G.

It was originally created in 1949 as the Religious Association of Judaism, and renamed in 1992. The Association's seat is located in Warsaw, with seven administrative branches throughout the country. ZGW≈ª consists of approximately 2,000 members (1998) congregating in nine municipalities. The Union operates seven active synagogues and 15 prayer houses. Also, ZGW≈ª publishes its own periodicals, as well as the popular Jewish Calendar (Kalendarz ≈ªydowski). Since 2003, the president of the Union is Piotr Kadlƒçik. Activities The main goal of the Association is to organize religious and cultural life for its members. The Association continues the democratic traditions of the Jewish religious presence in the country preceding the Holocaust and the subsequent religious strife in Soviet-dominated Poland from before the Revolutions of 1989. The Jewish community was almost completely destroyed in World War II, along with most of its religious monuments. ZGW≈ª helps Polish Jews - including the descendants of the Holocaust survivors - in a variety of legal matters, both communal and personal, including aiding in the process of recovery and restoration of property once owned by the Jewish Kehilla (◊ß◊î◊ú◊î), and nationalized in Communist Poland, like the White Stork Synagogue in Wroc≈Çaw (see gallery). ZGW≈ª activities are financed by the resources of the union, and in part, by grants from the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC). Some specific projects are also supported financially by the Ministry of Culture, the Arts of Poland, and other private sponsors. The Union maintains all active synagogues, prayer houses, and historical cemeteries. It oversees the organization of ritual dining, slaughter of animals, distribution of kosher food, and communal baths. The Association also maintains specialized religious groups (such as the \\"burial brotherhood\\"), and manages its own health care resources and social support networks. It is a partner with many state institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGO's), working toward the preservation and promotion of the Jewish heritage in Poland. It also takes an active role in the preservation of Jewish historical monuments that are considered a part of the national heritage of Poland. The Association also runs language schools, and organizes educational courses, lectures, seminars, conferences, and training sessions, and publishes its own magazines and books. Organization The Union of Jewish Communities in Poland was officially registered in 1993, although at present it operates under the (later) Act of Polish Parliament \\"Dziennik Ustaw No. 41 par. 251\\", signed on February 27, 1997. It is a legal continuation of the Religious Union of Judaism (ZwiƒÖzek Religijny Wyznania Moj≈ºeszowego), which was established in 1946. The Association is composed of eight Jewish municipalities, including Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw, Krak√≥w, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Szczecin, Katowice, Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, and Legnica. All smaller Jewish communities are subordinate to the branch offices of the Association. ZGW≈ª brings together all adults of the Jewish faith along with people of Jewish nationality and origin who are not following any other religions, but who own Polish citizenship (or simply reside in Poland). The Chairman of the Association, who was elected in October 2003, is its former Vice-President, Piotr Kadlƒçik. Union representatives sit on the Board of Directors of several Jewish organizations, including the European Jewish Congress, the European Jewish Fund, the Foundation for the Preservation of Jewish Heritage in Poland, the American Jewish Committee (AJC), the National Council for Revindication Agreements in Poland, and the World Federation of Polish Jews.

On Norfolk's death it passed to his son, who sold it in 1688 to a John Wheely.\\"Sir Francis Jobson, who had been one of the Visitors of the Monasteries. His granddaughter brought them in marriage to Edward Brooke Esq. of Suffolk. Their daughter was mother of Sir James Norfolk, who acquired the Castle in 1656\\" Shortly before the return of Charles II to England and the restoration of the monarchy, ignoring those who held letters of patents for the office of Serjeant-at-Arms granted by Charles I, the House of Commons of the Convention Parliament appointed James Norfolk to the office on 25 April 1660.The four office holders who were ignored were Michael Crake, Edward Birkhead, and Richard and William Bishop . In January 1661 James Norfolk was instructed by the House to find the bodies of the regicides John Bradshaw, Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and Thomas Pride. He located the first three corpses which were then‚Äîon 30 January 1661 (12 years to the day since the execution of Charles I)‚Äîsubject to a posthumous execution: disinterred, hanged at Tyburn and beheaded. The bodies were thrown into a pit and the heads placed on spikes at the end of Westminster Hall (the building where the trial of Charles I had taken place). Norfolk was reappointed as Serjeant-at-Arms to the Speaker of the House of Commons in May 1661 with Royal consent. At the Restoration a new Mace had been commissioned but in 1670 Norfolk reported to the House that the Mace was no longer fit for service, so an order was issued to the Master of the Jewel House to have a new one made for the Serjeant-at- Arms' use. On 2 June 1675 the Speaker of the House of Commons ordered that Norfolk be apprehended and sent to the Tower of London for failure to carry out wishes of the House of Commons. However, he could not be found. His disappearance coincided with a dispute between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Commons had ordered Sergeant Norfolk to detain certain people overnight so that they could be brought to the bar of the House of Commons for questioning. Black Rod was ordered by the House of Lords to free the men. Black Rod had carried out his orders while Norfolk had failed to carry out his. Norfolk died and was buried in the churchyard at Romford Chapel on 18 November 1680.

Union Of India and Ors. (case number: Writ Petition (Civil) 356 of 1977; case citation: AIR 1980 SC 1789) is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India that applied and evolved the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution of India. In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court provided key clarifications on the interpretation of the basic structure doctrine. The court ruled that the power of the parliament to amend the constitution is limited by the constitution. Hence the parliament cannot exercise this limited power to grant itself an unlimited power. In addition, a majority of the court also held that the parliament's power to amend is not a power to destroy. Hence the parliament cannot emasculate the fundamental rights of individuals, and also includes the right to liberty and equality(which is not a fundamental right but considered a basic structure of the Constitution) . The ruling struck down article 4 and 55 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 enacted during the Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.. Judgement (5) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend by way of addition, variation or repeal the provisions of this Constitution under this article. The above clauses were unanimously ruled as unconstitutional. Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud explained in his opinion that since, as had been previously held in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, the power of Parliament to amend the constitution was limited, it could not by amending the constitution convert this limited power into an unlimited power (as it had purported to do by the 42nd amendment). Section 4 of the 42nd Amendment, had amended Article 31C of the Constitution to accord precedence to the Directive Principles of State Policy articulated in Part IV of the Constitution over the Fundamental Rights of individuals articulated in Part III of Indian Constitution. By a verdict of 4-1, with Justice P.N. Bhagwati dissenting, the court held section 4 of the 42nd Amendment to be unconstitutional.

The three story Greek Revival-style plantation house was completed in 1848. It was extensively recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1936 and 1937. It was named for the Yaupon holly trees that were once a prominent feature of the front grounds. Architectural historians at the Alabama Historical Commission consider it to be among the most notable of the \\"stately pillared houses\\" in Alabama. History Youpon was built for William T. Mathews under the direction of George Lynch, a contractor from Maryland. Mathews was a planter and local builder. The property was purchased by the Frank Tait family around the turn of the 20th century. It remained with descendants of the Taits until it was purchased by the Rutherford family in 1999.The Wilcox Area Chamber of Commerce website contains different spellings and dates than The Alabama Catalog, which was prepared by state architectural historians. Where conflicting information exists, The Alabama Catalog was relied upon as the most authoritative source. Architecture The east side and rear (south) of the main house, showing attached octagonal kitchen. The plan features a fully raised brick basement floor that is topped by two stories of wood-frame construction. The ground floor originally contained servant spaces, with the formal rooms on the principal floor and bedrooms on the uppermost floor. The floor-plan is rectangular. The house is bisected by a central hallway measuring wide and long, present on the two primary levels. The facade is five bays wide and four bays deep, with central doorways crowned by fanlights on the first and second floors of the front. The central three bays of the front facade are fronted by a monumental tetrastyle Doric portico, with a full-width cantilevered second floor balcony. The Greek Revival portico was added after the completion of the main house, which was originally built in the Federal style. The original octagonal detached kitchen was destroyed in a fire around 1900. Another octagonal dependency, with a tent-like flared roof, was then moved and connected to the rear porch of the main house to serve as a kitchen. The rear porch was enclosed in 1978.

He created large allegorical figures and stylized depictions of the American west. Early life and education Born in Massachusetts in 1896, Stevens first showed an interest in sculpture in his early adolescence, and began experimenting with figures after his grandfather demonstrated how to carve figures from a broken alabaster vase. He continued to study sculpture throughout high school, his progress prompting the art director for the school district to lobby the school district pay to send Stevens to evening classes with Harvard students at Copley Plaza Studios. Upon graduating, Stevens was accepted into the Boston Museum School where he continued his studies under the tutelage of Bela Pratt. Stevens volunteered for the armed forces in 1917 to fight in World War I. Upon his return from the war, he resumed his studies at the Boston Museum School and spent the two following summers at the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, which Tiffany founded to help encourage and fund up-and-coming young artists. Prix de Rome fellowship Stevens first garnered international attention when he won the Rome Prize for sculpture in 1922, receiving a fellowship to study sculpture at the American Academy in Rome as well as funds to travel to experience the art of Western Europe. Precedent dictated that the Prix de Rome fellows would spend time in Greece studying the classical sculpture there, but Stevens instead decided to go to Egypt. His time with the Ancient Egyptian bas-relief murals and stylized sculpture heavily impacted his style, which would continue to evoke ancient Egyptian and contemporary Art Deco influences throughout his life. Before his trip to Rome, Stevens would meet Daniel Chester French, a fellow American sculptor whose most famous work is the colossal statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. French confided to Stevens that he wished he had Stevens' position in the art world at a time when French believed America was beginning to gain clout and credibility in sculpture. Following this exchange, Stevens made his artistic focus to use his sculpture to glorify that which he believed was uniquely American, and American-made. During his trip to Europe, Stevens would express his disapproval at the number of American expatriate artists, condemning them as \\"un-American\\" and saying they lacked faith in American sculpture. Return to the USA After taking several commissions in New York, Stevens moved out west to Santa Barbara. It was in Southern California that he first met Millard Sheets, already an established artist and founding professor of the fine arts program at Scripps College. The two artists became friends, and Stevens accompanied Sheets on his yearly trip to Mexico in 1934, where the two painted watercolors. Stevens' sculpture \\"Monument to the Young Farmers of the Nation\\" (1938) currently stands at the entrance to the Millard Sheets Center for the Arts in Los Angeles, California. Sheets landed Stevens a one-man exhibition at Scripps in 1935 that displayed both Stevens' sculpture and the watercolors he had painted with Sheets. One of the pieces in the exhibition, a ceramic sea lion, was duplicated by Scripps professor William Manker and became the fountains in Scripps' Seal Court (the pieces were later recast in bronze by Paul Soldner). Sheets later persuaded Stevens to loan his 1931 piece \\"Doors of Life\\" to the college for the new Florence Rand Lang art building, now the Elizabeth Hubert Malott Commons, built in 1939. The doors remained on long term loan until Scripps College Trustee Mrs. G. F. Cruickshank agreed to donate the doors officially. Cody and WWII years Meanwhile, Stevens had been spending his summers in Cody, Wyoming working on expanding his American West-themed body of work. He modeled and sculpted in clay, plaster, bronze and marble everything from the animals and workers of the ranches to the champion bronco riders he saw at local rodeos. He was granted the first one-man show at Cody's Buffalo Bill Museum in 1932. It was in Cody that Cowboy High Style began to develop, catalyzed both by Stevens' work and the work of local furniture designer Thomas Molesworth, both of whom championed simple designs imbued with the spirit of the American West. Stevens' figures from this period are scattered all over the American Southwest. One of his largest commissions was for the Centennial Fairgrounds and Esplanade for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas. He created three monumental allegorical figures, \\"Tenor\\", \\"Contralto\\", and \\"Texas\\", along with a representation of the chimera-like nonsense creature of Texan folklore, the \\"Woofus\\". The bronze sculptures were melted down to help the war effort during World War II, but the figures were reconstructed in stainless steel in 2009 and have been restored to their original positions. After this commission, Stevens began to sculpt large allegorical figures such as \\"America\\" (1941), \\"American Sculptor\\" (1941), and \\"The Confederacy\\" (1941) as part of his canon in addition to his original cowboys and animals. In 1939 he won a competition to create colossal monuments for the New York World's Fair. Stevens volunteered for military service once more when the United States entered WWII, and was assigned to a secret unit called Project 19. Post-war years Stevens returned from the war and settled in Tulsa before moving to Arizona with his second wife. He lived and sculpted in Tempe, Arizona until his death in 1972.

The Ascoceratidae are divided into two, unequal subfamilies. Ascoceratinae have an exogastric ascoceroid stage characterized by the development of a protruding neck ending at the aperture, both ocular and hyponomic sinuses which form when fully grown, and camerae that are mostly confined to the dorsal half of the shell. The siphuncle is close to the venter and found only in the adapical portion. Siphuncle segments nummuloidal (beaded in appearance), septal necks cyrtochoanitic (flared outwardly) generally with recumbent (bent back on themselves) brims. The deciduous stage, which is the juvenile or immature, is orthoconic to cytroconic, with long but variable camerae, siphuncle with orthochoanitic septal necks and tubular segments, and generally straight sutures. Ascoceratinae includes the following genera, Ascoceras, Aphragmites, Billingsites, Glossoceras, Lindtroemoceras, Parascoceras, Suchertoceras. With the exception of Billingsites and Suchertoceras, which are from the Ordovician, these genera are all Silurian.

The company went out of business in 1976. Mark Records and Silver Crest Records are comparable labels. Keysor-Century had a pressing plant in Saugus.  History  James Bernard (\\"Bud\\") Keysor, Jr. (1906‚Äì2000) founded Keysor-Century Corporation of Saugus and was a partner in Century Record Manufacturing Company. He was also the Corporate Secretary. He founded Keysor-Century in 1954 as a manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride resins. RCA Records was Keysor-Century's biggest customer. Jim Keysor (1927‚Äì2014), son of James Bernard Keysor, Jr., had once served as President of Keysor-Century Record Company.

In 2002, Keysor-Century was producing PVC resins for the flooring and packaging markets in Saugus, California. The firm also operated a compounding facility in Newark, Delaware. The company had been a pioneer in creating PVC resins for the record industry. Keysor-Century produced (i) a black vinyl record compound called KC-B450 in the form of opaque black free flowing pellets (for standard records), (ii) a widely popular translucent red, yellow, green, and blue KC-B460/470 series, and later, (iii) an audiophile grade called KC-600. In two audiophile mass market tests by A&M;, Keysor- Century's KC-600 was used in the initial production of Supertramp's L.P., ...Famous Last Words... (fall 1982), and in the initial production (800,000 disks) of Styx's L.P., Kilroy Was Here (February 1983). In 1982, Keysor- Century had added plants in Delaware City, Delaware, and Ajax, Ontario. At that time, Keysor-Century, Lenahan Chemicals (Murfreesboro, Tennessee), and Tenneco Chemical, Inc., (Burlington & Flemington, New Jersey) were the top three American bulk resin suppliers for records. In 1985, Keysor-Century claimed to be the largest U.S. producer of record compound and its customers included Warner, RCA, Capitol, Motown, CBS, Musical Heritage Society, Nonesuch, Deutsche Grammophon, and A&M.; Keysor-Century Corporation was founded in 1954. Outside of the record industry, Keysor-Century was also a top-twenty supplier to general industry. Keysor-Century company also supplied bulk resin for injection molding applications in the production of cassette shells and the like, used by the industry as well as its own tape duplicating service.  Bankruptcy  The Keysor-Century Corporation submitted a voluntary petition March 19, 2002, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Fernando, California, for protection from creditors under Chapter 11, and after 21 months (in December, just before Christmas 2003), filed to liquidate under Chapter 7.

In all cases, the strata are products of terrigenous (non-marine) environments dominated by fluvial depositional and erosional systems (rivers and streams).  Brief geologic history  The rocks found in and around Wichita Falls result from southwesterly-flowing Permian streams that deposited sands in channels and silts and clays on the surrounding floodplains. Calcium- carbonate rich soils concurrently developed adjacent to these streams. These were likely buried by further Permian sedimentation and then lithified. Pleistocene erosion removed the younger rocks, exposing the current strata. Exposures of sediments indicate that northeast-flowing streams locally deposited silts, clays, sands, and some gravels on the Permian rocks. These are subsequently modified by modern (Holocene) stream erosion and deposition.  Permian Rocks  In the Permian geologic period, North-Central Texas was a part of the western coastal zone of equatorial Pangea, a super-continental land mass.Ziegler, A.M., Hulver, M.L. and Rowley, D.B., 1997, Permian World Topography and Climate.

The Petrolia Formation (of the Late Wolfcampian-Leonardian systems) dominates the exposed Permian strata in Wichita falls, as mapped by the 1987 Texas Atlas of Geology.Hentz, T. F., and Brown, L. F., Jr., 1987, Wichita Falls‚ÄìLawton sheet: The University of Texas at Austin, Bureau of Economic Geology, Geologic Atlas of Texas, 1 sheet, scale 1:250,000. The map describes the formation as 360‚Äì400 feet of weakly or unstratified mudstone with laminated, cross-bedded sandstone lenses. The formation increases in mudstone content upsection. Sandstone lenses contain terrestrial fossils of plants, vertebrates, and footprints. The unit contains calcareous nodules of varying sizes as well as poorly indurated \\"conglomerate\\" with vertebrate fossils. In general the entire package is only weakly lithified, perhaps indicating that the region was not appreciably covered by a thick package of younger strata. Several correlated sandstone units crop out in the immediate region. These dominate the region adjacent to the Seymour Highway, on the slopes to the south of the Wichita River (locally known as \\"the bluffs\\"). The Texas Atlas of Geology mapped these as ss6. Most outcrops are buff-colored, medium-grained, well-sorted quartzose sandstones. These exhibit extensive cross-bedding and soft-sediment deformation features. Some deposits are friable, others well cemented. Locally, there appears to be three prominent layers of sandstone separated by mudstone. Because of variable erosion rates, each influences topography by forming ledges and benches, and in places may form mesa-like landforms. In and around the city, these occur roughly at 960, 1000, and 1060 feet above sea level.  Pleistocene and/or early Holocene Sediments  Pleistocene and/or early Holocene quartzite and other hard-stone gravels on soil surface. Up to 30 feet of fluvial deposits of unconsolidated gravel, sand, and silt mapped as terrace deposition by the 1987 Texas Atlas of Geology. Gravels are granule-to-cobble size, with clasts of angular to well-rounded quartzite, quartz, and chert from distal sources and lesser fragments of local strata. The sands are orange-brown to tan, fine- to coarse-grained with preserved soils.  Holocene Sediments  Up to 30 feet of floodplain and channel sand, silt, clay, and gravel from the modern stream systems. This includes terrace deposits near floodplain, colluvium on valley slopes, and local wind-blown sand and silt. Structural Geology The region is largely underlain with shallowly west-dipping strata, but a significant uplifted block is found in the subsurface immediately north of Wichita Falls. This block, locally known as the Red River uplift, may be part of an uplifted system that extends eastward, joining the Muenster Arch. The uplifts offset Pennsylvanian and older strata in the subsurface and are thought to be contemporaneous with the Ouachita and Ancestral Rocky Orogenies. These Pennsylvanian orogenies resulted from the closure of the Iapetus ocean as the Gondwana and Laurentia continents collided to form Pangea.  Oil and Gas Resources Petroleum resources were discovered in the region in the early 1900s, and the area remains a locus of exploration and production. Water Resources =Groundwater= Groundwater in Wichita Falls is drawn from the Seymour aquifer or from alluvial aquifers associated with local streams.Duffin, G., L., and Beynon, B.E., 1992, Evaluation of Water Resources in Parts of the Rolling Prairies Region of North-Central Texas, Texas Water Development Board, Report 337, 93 p. Groundwater withdrawals are limited to individual property owners and do not feed into the municipal supply for the city of Wichita Falls. However, the nearby city of Burkburnett, located 15 miles north of (and down hydraulic gradient from) Wichita Falls relies in part on this aquifer for municipal supply.McGregor, W., Hancock-White, K., and Oswald, R., 2011, Texoma Water Resources, unpublished student report, Midwestern State University Geosciences. The Seymour aquifer may be locally confined under clay-rich soils and sediments. In the southern part of the city, the distribution and nature of the aquifer is consistent with one hosted by Pleistocene and/or Holocene fluvial channel deposits. The depth to water (hydrostatic head) averages 14 feet below the surface, closely correlated with topography. The water is likely sourced in coarse sands and gravels 10-19' below the surface. Dry holes in this same area contain no typically sand- gravel layers within the first 22 feet. The horizontal distribution of this shallow aquifer is irregular; dry holes may be adjacent to those with water yields. Cedar Springs Pools Seymour aquifer groundwater once fed the Cedar Springs Pools, a popular recreational public swimming facility in the 1930s and 40s. The two pools were located between Taft Boulevard and Robin Lane north of Hampstead Rd. in the southern part of Wichita Falls. Long-time residents have vivid memoirs of the frigid waters in these ponds. =Surface water= Wichita River watershed and adjacent streams and lakes The Wichita River Wichita Falls is located along the Wichita River roughly 25 miles southwest of its confluence with the Red River. The river essentially bisects the city into north and south. The river exhibits many of the classic morphological features associated with meandering streams; Lucy Park, an expansive city green space, occupies a large meander bend near downtown and the Tanglewood subdivision surrounds an oxbow lake. The upstream waters of the Wichita River are impounded for flood control and reservoir capacity. =Lake Diversion= Lake Diversion was impounded in 1924 in northwest Archer and northeast Baylor counties, 71 miles upstream from Wichita Falls. Lake Diversion sits at an elevation of 1,053 feet above sea level, has a surface area of 3,133 acres, and a maximum depth of 35 feet. The lake serves to alleviate flooding, and a source of water for the Dundee fish hatchery, and as an irrigation source, feeding a 135-mile network of irrigation canals that extend to the east side of Wichita Falls (Wichita County Water Improvement District #2).FindLakes website, 2011, http://findlakes.com/lake_diversion_texas~tx01011.htm. accessed November 26, 2011 =Lake Kemp= Located 8 miles north of Seymour in Baylor County and 40 miles upstream of Wichita Falls, Lake Kemp was developed in 1924 to alleviate persistent flooding issues downstream and to provide irrigation and drinking water for the city and the adjacent farming areas. The elevation of Lake Kemp is 1,142 feet asl and contains 245,308 acre feet (80 billion gallons) at its maximum capacity. The lake has 100 miles of shoreline, some of which is used for housing and recreation.\\"LAKE KEMP,\\" Handbook of Texas Online Published by the Texas State Historical Association. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rol46, accessed November 23, 2011 Lake Kemp was used as a source of drinking water through the 1950s but lost popularity because of its gypsum taste.

Additionally, Lake Kemp provides water to the American Electric Power Company in Oklaunion, Texas. Lake Kemp is named for entrepreneur Joseph A. Kemp. =Truscott Brine Lake= Truscott Brine Lake Truscott Brine Lake was completed in 1987 by the Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District.Haynie, M.M., Burke, G.F., Baldys, S., 2011, \\"Chloride Control and Monitoring Program in the Wichita River Basin, Texas, 1996-2009\\", United States Geological Survey Fact Sheet #2011-3018 The lake covers 2.98 acres with 24 miles of shoreline. The lake has a normal storage of 107,000 acre-feet, a maximum capacity of 116,200 acre-feet of water with a maximum discharge rate of 35,400 cubic feet per second. The lake drains a 26-square mile area.FindLakes website, 2011, http://findlakes.com/truscott_brine_lake_texas~tx05996.htm. accessed November 27, 2011. This project is aimed at controlling chloride and other salinity components in the Wichita River watershed. There are naturally occurring salt springs in the area. The salt springs result from the percolation of groundwater through Permian strata rich in evaporite minerals. Authorized in 1974, and completed in 1987, a 5-foot tall inflatable collection dam was constructed across the South Wichita River near Guthrie, Texas. During low flow periods, this salty water is piped 23 miles to Truscott Brine Lake, where the water is contained for eventual evaporation. An additional low-water inflatable dam has been installed on the Middle Fork of the Wichita River, but a pipeline to Truscott Lake has not yet been completed.\\"Truscott Brine Lake\\" Army Corps of Engineers website, 1999, http://www.swt.usace.army.mil/library/Chloride%20Control%20-%20Wichita%20River%20Basin/library/fs-110-00.pdf. accessed November 26, 2011 Holliday Creek Holliday Creek is a tributary to the Wichita River that originates south of Dundee in Archer County, Texas, to the north edge of Wichita Falls.

The lake is recharged from the Holliday Creek watershed and from irrigation conduits from Lake Diversion. The original lake covered 2,200 acres with a maximum capacity of 14,000 acre-feet of water. In 1995, the city constructed a new spillway that was 4.7 feet lower than the previous spillway.Howell, M., \\"After 15 years, Lake Wichita is Slowly Reaching Its New Potential\\", Times Record News, Wichita Falls, Texas, August 19, 2010. as part a flood control project on Holliday Creek. The current lake now covers 1,224 acres to a maximum depth of 8 feet at its deepest spot. Because of its shallow nature, this lake is currently only used for recreation and not as a municipal reservoir.\\"LAKE WICHITA,\\" Handbook of Texas Online Published by the Texas State Historical Association. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rol85, accessed November 10, 2011.

These enzymes utilize this potent radical intermediate to perform an array of unusual (from the perspective of organic chemistry) transformations, often to functionalize unactivated C-H bonds. Radical SAM enzymes are involved in cofactor biosynthesis, enzyme activation, peptide modification, post- transcriptional and post-translational modifications, metalloprotein cluster formation, tRNA modification, lipid metabolism, biosynthesis of antibiotics and natural products etc. The vast majority of known radical SAM enzymes belong to the radical SAM superfamily, and have a cysteine-rich motif that matches or resembles CxxxCxxC.  History and mechanism As of 2001, 645 unique radical SAM enzymes have been identified from 126 species in all three domains of life. According to the EFI and SFLD databases, more than 220,000 radical SAM enzymes are predicted to be involved in 85 types of biochemical transformations. The mechanism for these reactions entail transfer of a methyl or adenosyl group from sulfur to iron. The resulting organoiron complex subsequently releases the organic radical. The latter step is reminiscent of the behavior of adenosyl and methyl cobalamins.  Nomenclature  All enzymes including radical SAM superfamily follow an easy guideline for systematic naming. Systematic naming of enzymes allows a uniform naming process that is recognized by all scientists to understand corresponding function. The first word of the enzyme name often shows the substrate of the enzyme. The position of the reaction on the substrate will also be in the beginning portion of the name. Lastly, the class of the enzyme will be described in the other half of the name which will end in suffix -ase. The class of an enzyme will describe what the enzyme is doing or changing on the substrate. For example, a ligase combines two molecules to form a new bond. Superimposition of three radical SAM core domains. Side views of radical SAM enzymes BioB (PDB: 1R30), MoaA (PDB: 1TV8) and phTYW1 (PDB: 2YX0) are shown front and back.

The audience is highly encouraged to research more into current studies on radical SAM enzymes. Many of which are responsible for fascinating yet important reactions. Radical SAM enzymes and their mechanisms known before 2008 are well-summarized by Frey et al, 2008 (). Since 2015, more review articles on radical SAM enzymes are open to the public. The following are only a few out of many informative resources on radical SAM enzymes. # Recent Advances in Radical SAM Enzymology: New Structures and Mechanisms: # Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes: # Radical S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) Enzymes in Cofactor Biosynthesis: A Treasure Trove of Complex Organic Radical Rearrangement Reactions: # Molecular architectures and functions of radical enzymes and their (re)activating proteins: = Carbon methylation = Radical SAM methylases/methyltransferases are one of the largest yet diverse subgroups and are capable of methylating a broad range of unreactive carbon and phosphorus centers. These enzymes are divided into four classes (Class A, B, C and D) with representative methylation mechanisms. The shared characteristic of the three major classes A, B and C is the usage of SAM, split into two distinct roles: one as a source of a methyl group donor, and the second as a source of 5'-dAdo radical. The recently documented class D utilizes a different methylation mechanism.  Class A sub-family  * Class A enzymes methylates specific adenosine residues on rRNA and/or tRNA. In other words, they are RNA base-modifying radical SAM enzymes. * The most mechanistically well-characterized are enzymes RlmN and Cfr. Both enzymes methylates substrate by adding a methylene fragment originating from SAM molecule. Therefore, RlmN and Cfr are considered methyl synthases instead of methyltransferases.  Class B sub-family  * Class B enzymes are the largest and most versatile which can methylate a wide range of carbon and phosphorus centers. * These enzymes require a cobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor as an intermediate methyl group carrier to transfer a methyl group from SAM to substrate. * One well-investigated representative enzyme is TsrM which involves in tryptophan methylation in thiostrepton biosynthesis.  Class C sub-family  * Class C enzymes are reported to play roles in biosynthesis of complex natural products and secondary metabolites. These enzymes methylate heteroaromatic substrates and are cobalamin-independent. * These enzymes contain both the radical SAM motif and exhibit striking sequence similarity to coproporhyrinogen III oxidase (HemN), a radical SAM enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis * Recently, detailed mechanistic investigation on two important class C radical SAM methylases have been reported: *# TbtI is involved in the biosynthesis of potent thiopeptide antibiotic thiomuracin. *# Jaw5 is suggested to be responsible for cyclopropane modifications.  Class D sub- family  * Class D is the most recently discovered and has been shown to not use SAM for methylation which is different from the three classes described above. Instead, these enzymes use methylenetetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor. * The prototype MJ0619 is proposed to play a role in the biosynthesis of cofactor methanopterin which is required in methanogesis, an essential methane-producing pathway dominantly found in the Archaean domain. = Methylthiolation of tRNAs = Methythiotransferases belong to a subset of radical SAM enzymes that contain two [4Fe-4S]+ clusters and one radical SAM domain. Methylthiotransferases play a major role in catalyzing methylthiolation on tRNA nucleotides or anticodons through a redox mechanism. Thiolation modification is believed to maintain translational efficiency and fidelity. MiaB and RimO are both well-characterized and bacterial prototypes for tRNA-modifying methylthiotransferases * MiaB introduces a methylthio group to the isopentenylated A37 derivatives in the tRNA of S. Typhimurium and E. coli by utilizing one SAM molecule to generate 5'-dAdo radical to activate the substrate and a second SAM to donate a sulfur atom to the substrate. * RimO is responsible for post-translational modification of Asp88 of the ribosomal protein S12 in E. coli. A recently determined crystal structure sheds light on the mechanistic action of RimO. The enzyme catalyzes pentasulfide bridge formation linking two Fe-S clusters to allow for sulfur insertion to the substrate. eMtaB is the designated methylthiotransferase in eukaryotic and archaeal cells. eMtaB catalyzes the methylthiolation of tRNA at position 37 on N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine. A bacterial homologue of eMtaB, YqeV has been reported and suggested to function similarly to MiaB and RimO. = Sulfur insertion into unreactive C-H bonds = Sulfurtransferases are a small subset of radical SAM enzymes. Two well-known examples are BioB and LipA which are independently responsible for biotin synthesis and lipoic acid metabolism, respectively. * BioB or biotin synthase is a radical SAM enzyme that employs one [4Fe-4S] center to thiolate dethiobitin, thus converting it to biotin or also known as vitamin B7. Vitamin B7 is a cofactor used in carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions in many organisms. * LipA or lipoyl synthase is radical SAM sulfurtransferase utilizing two [4Fe-4S] clusters to catalyze the final step in lipoic acid biosynthesis. = Carbon insertion = Nitrogenase is a metallozyme with essential function in the biological nitrogen fixation reaction. The M-cluster ([MoFe7S9C-homocitrate]) and P-cluster ([Fe8S7]) are highly unique metalloclusters present in nitrogenase. The best-studied nitrogenase up-to-date is Mo nitrogenase with M-cluster and P-cluster bearing important roles in substrate reduction. The active site of Mo nitrogenase is the M-cluster, a metal-sulfur cluster containing a carbide at its core. Within the biosynthesis of M-cluster, radical SAM enzyme NifB has been recognized to catalyze a carbon insertion reaction, leading to formation of a Mo/homocitrate-free precursor of M-cluster. = Anaerobic oxidative decarboxylation = * One well-studied example is HemN. HemN or anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase is a radical SAM enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporhyrinogen IX, an important intermediate in heme biosynthesis. A recently published study shows evidence supporting HemN utilizes two SAM molecules to mediate radical-mediated hydrogen transfer for the sequential decarboxylation of the two propionate groups of coproporphyrinogen III. * Hyperthermophilic sulfate-reducing archaen Archaeoglobus fulgidus has been recently reported to enable anaerobic oxidation of long chain n-alkanes. PflD is reported to be responsible for the capacity of A. fulgidus to grow on a wide range of unsaturated carbons and fatty acids. A detailed biochemical and mechanistic characterization of PflD is still undergoing but preliminary data suggest PflD may be a radical SAM enzyme. = Protein radical formation = Glycyl radical enzyme activating enzymes (GRE-AEs) are radical SAM subset that can house a stable and catalytically essential glycyl radical in their active state. The underlying chemistry is considered to be the simplest in the radical SAM superfamily with H-atom abstraction by the 5'-dAdo radical being the product of the reaction. A few examples include: * Pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme (PFL-AE) catalyzes the activation of PFL, a central enzyme in anaerobic glucose metabolism in microbes. * Benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS) is a central enzyme in anaerobic toluene catabolism. = Peptide modifications = Radical SAM enzymes that can catalyze sulfur-to-alpha carbon or sulfur-to- beta thioether cross-linked peptides (sactipeptides and lanthipeptides, respectively) are important to generate an essential class of peptide with significant antibacterial, spermicidal and hemolytic properties. Another common name for this peptide class is ribosomally synthesized and post- translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Another important subset of peptide-modifying radical SAM enzymes is SPASM/Twitch domain-carrying enzymes. SPASM/Twitch enzymes carry a functionalized C-terminal extension for the binding of two [4Fe-4S] clusters, especially important in post-translational modifications of peptides. The following examples are representative enzymes that can catalyze peptide modifications to generate specific natural products or cofactors. # TsrM in thiostrepton biosynthesis # PoyD and PoyC in polytheonamide biosynthesis # TbtI in thiomuracin biosynthesis # NosN in nosiheptide biosynthesis # MoaA in molybdopterin biosynthesis # PqqE in pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis # TunB in tunicamycin biosynthesis # OxsB in oxetanocin biosynthesis # BchE in anaerobic bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis # F0 synthases in F420 cofactor biosynthesis # MqnE and MqnC in menaquinone biosynthesis # QhpD in post-translational processing of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase = Epimerization = Radical SAM epimerases are responsible for the regioselective introduction of D-amino acids into RiPPs. Two well-known enzymes have been thoroughly described in RiPP biosynthetic pathways. * PoyD installs numerous D-stereocenters in enzyme PoyA to ultimately help facilitate polytheonamide biosynthesis. Polytheoamide is a natural potent cytoxic agent by forming pores in membranes. This peptide cytotoxin is naturally produced by uncultivated bacteria that exist as symbionts in a marine sponge. * YydG epimerase modifies two amino acid positions on YydF in Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. A recent study has reported the extrinsically added YydF mediates subsequent dissipation of membrane potential via membrane permeabilization, resulting in death of the organism. = Complex carbon skeleton rearrangements = Another subset of radical SAM superfamily has been shown to catalyze carbon skeleton rearrangements especially in the areas of DNA repair and cofactor biosynthesis. * DNA spore photoproduct lysase (SPL) is a radical SAM that can repair DNA thymine dimers (spore product, SP) caused by UV radiation. Despite of remaining unknowns and controversies involving SPL-catalyzed reaction, it is certain that SPL utilizes SAM as a cofactor to generate 5'-dAdo radical to revert SP to two thymine residues. * HydG is a radical SAM responsible for generating CO and CN‚àí ligands in the [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase (HydA) in various anaerobic bacteria. * Radical SAM MoaA and MoaC are involved in converting GTP into cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Overall, both play important roles in molybdopterinbiosynthesis. = Other reactions = * A recent study has reported a novel radical SAM enzyme with intrinsic lyase activity that is able to catalyze lysine transfer reaction, generating archaea-specific archaosine-containing tRNAs. * Viperin is an interferon-stimulated radical SAM enzyme which converts CTP to ddhCTP (3 π-deoxy-3‚Ä≤,4 πdidehydro-CTP), which is a chain terminator for viral RdRps and therefore a natural antiviral compound.  Clinical considerations  * Deficiency in human tRNA methylthiotransferase eMtaB has been shown to be responsible for abnormal insulin synthesis and predisposition to type 2 diabetes. * Mutations in human GTP cyclase MoaA has been reported to lead to molybdenum cofactor deficiency, a usually fatal disease accompanied by severe neurological symptoms. * Mutations in human wybutosine-tRNA modifying enzyme Tyw1 promotes retrovirus infection. * Alterations in human tRNA-modifying enzyme Elp3 results in progression into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). * Mutations in human antiviral RSAD1 has been shown to be associated with congenital heart disease. * Mutations in human sulfurtransferase LipA has been implicated in glycine encephalopathy, pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid synthetase deficiency. * Mutations in human methylthiotransferase MiaB are related to impaired cardiac and respiratory functions.  Therapeutic applications  Microbes have been extensively used for the discovery of new antibiotics. However, a growing public concern of multi-drug resistant pathogens has been emerging in the last few decades. Thus, newly developed or novel antibiotics are in utmost demand. Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are getting more attention as a newer and major group of antibiotics thanks to having a very narrow of activity spectrum, which can benefit patients, as their side effects will be lesser than the broad-spectrum antibiotics. Below are a few examples of radical SAM enzymes have been shown to be promising targets for antibiotic and antiviral development. * Inhibition of radical SAM enzyme MnqE in menaoquinone biosynthesis is reported to be an effective antibacterial strategy against H. pylori. * Radical SAM enzyme BlsE has recently been discovered to be a central enzyme in blasticidin S biosynthetic pathway. Blasticidin S produced by Streptomyces griseochromogenes exhibits strong inhibitory activity against rice blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae Cavara. This compound specifically inhibits protein synthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes through inhibition of peptide bond formation in the ribosome machinery. * A new fungal radical SAM enzyme has also been recently reported to facilitate the biocatalytic routes for synthesis of 3'-deoxy nucleotides/nucleosides. 3'deoxynucleotides are an important class of drugs since they interfere with the metabolism of nucleotides, and their incorporation into DNA or RNA terminates cell division and replication. This activity explains why this compound is an essential group of antiviral, antibacterial or anticancer drug.  Examples  = Radical = Examples of radical SAM enzymes found within the radical SAM superfamily include: * AblA - lysine 2,3-aminomutase (osmolyte biosynthesis - N-epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine) * AlbA - subtilosin maturase (peptide modification) * AtsB - anaerobic sulfatase activase (enzyme activation) * BchE - anaerobic magnesium protoporphyrin-IX oxidative cyclase (cofactor biosynthesis - chlorophyll) * BioB - biotin synthase (cofactor biosynthesis - biotin) * BlsE - cytosylglucuronic acid decarboxylase - blasticidin S biosynthesis * BtrN - butirosin biosynthesis pathway oxidoreductase (aminoglycoside antibiotic biosynthesis) * Cfr - 23S rRNA (adenine(2503)-C(8))-methyltransferase - rRNA modification for antibiotic resistance * CofG - FO synthase, CofG subunit (cofactor biosynthesis - F420) * CofH - FO synthase, CofH subunit (cofactor biosynthesis - F420) * CutD - trimethylamine lyase-activating enzyme * DarE - darobactin maturase * DesII - D-desosamine biosynthesis deaminase (sugar modification for macrolide antibiotic biosynthesis) * EpmB - elongation factor P beta-lysylation protein (protein modification) * HemN - oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (cofactor biosynthesis - heme) * HmdB - 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase cofactor biosynthesis protein HmdB (note unusual CX5CX2C motif) * HpnR - hopanoid C-3 methylase (lipid biosynthesis - 3-methylhopanoid production) * HydE - [FeFe] hydrogenase H-cluster radical SAM maturase (metallocluster assembly) * HydG - [FeFe] hydrogenase H-cluster radical SAM maturase (metallocluster assembly) * LipA - lipoyl synthase (cofactor biosynthesis - lipoyl) * MftC - mycofactocin system maturase (peptide modification/cofactor biosynthesis - predicted) * MiaB - tRNA methylthiotransferase (tRNA modification) * MoaA - GTP 3',8-cyclase (cofactor biosynthesis - molybdopterin) * MqnC - dehypoxanthine futalosine cyclase (cofactor biosynthesis - menaquinone via futalosine) * MqnE - aminofutalosine synthase (cofactor biosynthesis - menaquinone via futalosine) * NifB - cofactor biosynthesis protein NifB (cofactor biosynthesis - FeMo cofactor) * NirJ - heme d1 biosynthesis radical SAM protein NirJ (cofactor biosynthesis - heme d1) * NosL - complex rearrangement of tryptophan to 3-methyl-2-indolic acid - nosiheptide biosynthesis * NrdG - anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase activase (enzyme activation) * PflA - pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme (enzyme activation) * PhpK - radical SAM P-methyltransferase - antibiotic biosynthesis * PqqE - PQQ biosynthesis enzyme (peptide modification / cofactor biosynthesis - PQQ) * PylB - methylornithine synthase, pyrrolysine biosynthesis protein PylB (amino acid biosynthesis - pyrrolysine) * QhpD (PeaB) - quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase maturation protein (enzyme activation) * QueE - 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine (CDG) synthase * RimO - ribosomal protein S12 methylthiotransferase * RlmN - 23S rRNA (adenine(2503)-C(2))-methyltransferase (rRNA modification) * ScfB - SCIFF maturase (peptide modification by thioether cross-link formation) * SkfB - sporulation killing factor maturase * SplB - spore photoproduct lyase (DNA repair) * ThiH - thiazole biosynthesis protein ThiH (cofactor biosynthesis - thiamine) * TrnC - thuricin biosynthesis * TrnD - thuricin biosynthesis * TsrT - tryptophan 2-C-methyltransferase (amino acid modification - antibiotic biosynthesis) * TYW1 - 4-demethylwyosine synthase (tRNA modification) * YqeV - tRNA methylthiotransferase (tRNA modification) = Non-canonical = In addition, several non-canonical radical SAM enzymes have been described. These cannot be recognized by the Pfam hidden Markov model PF04055, but still use three Cys residues as ligands to a 4Fe4S cluster and produce a radical from S-adenosylmethionine. These include * ThiC (PF01964) - thiamine biosynthesis protein ThiC (cofactor biosynthesis - thiamine) (Cys residues near extreme C-terminus) * Dph2 (PF01866) - diphthamide biosynthesis enzyme Dph2 (protein modification - diphthamide in translation elongation factor 2) (note different radical production, a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical) * PhnJ (PF06007) - phosphonate metabolism protein PhnJ (C-P phosphonate bond cleavage)  References   External links  *Structure Function Linkage Database (SFLD) List of Reactions Enzymes ","title":"Radical SAM"},{"id":"36467546","text":"Mary Coulter Montgomery (August 30, 1956 - August 24, 2017) was an American competition swimmer who won a silver medal in the 800 m freestyle at the 1975 Pan American Games.

Ganesh (born 4 December 1962) is a practitioner of the art of avadhana, a polyglot, an author in Sanskrit and Kannada and an extempore poet in multiple languages. He has performed more than 1300 avadhanas, in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu and Prakrit.Over 600 as of 2009, see Modern Sanskrit Writings in Karnataka. Over 965 as of 2012, see Kannadaprabha 29 November 2012 He is known for extempore composition of poetry (ƒÅ≈õukavita) during these performances, and even of chitrakavya. He is the only ≈öatƒÅvadhƒÅni from Karnataka. He once set a record by composing poetry for twenty-four hours continuously. From 30 November 2012 to 2 December 2012, he performed the first ever Shatavadhana entirely in Kannada. On 16 February 2014, in Bangalore, he performed his 1000th avadhƒÅna. Childhood and education Ganesh was born on 4 December 1962, in Kolar, Karnataka, to R. Shankar Narayan Aiyar and K. V. Alamelamma. Ganesh picked up Tamil, Kannada and Telugu from his environment as a child. Also in his childhood, he read Sanskrit and Kannada literature and was writing poetry at the age of sixteen. He learned English at school, and he later learned several other languages like Prakrit, Pali, Tamil, Hindi, Marathi, Greek, Latin and Italian. He has a B.E. degree in mechanical engineering from UVCE, an MSc (Engineering) degree in metallurgy from IISc, pursued research in materials science and metallurgy, has an MA degree in Sanskrit, and a D. Litt in Kannada, which was awarded by Hampi University for his thesis on the art of Avadhana in Kannada. Avadhana Ganesh is well known for his performances of avadhana, in which he composes extempore solutions in metrical verse to problems posed in parallel by the p·πõcchakas on stage, satisfying the constraints imposed by them, while simultaneously dealing with interruptions designed to break his concentration. The performance tests poetic skill, creativity, memory, concentration, scholarship, and wit. The main variants are the A·π£·π≠ƒÅvadhƒÅna (eight p·πõcchakas) and ≈öatƒÅvadhƒÅna (hundred p·πõcchakas), both of which he performs. Although there are records of Bellave Narahari Sastry performing avadhana in Kannada during 1933‚Äì36 (having learnt it from Telugu's Pisupati Chidambara Shastri), there was no living tradition of avadhana in Kannada when Ganesh took it up; thus he is credited with reviving avadhana in Kannada. In 1981, after seeing an avadhana performance for the first time, by Lepakshi Medavaram Mallikarjuna Sharma, he tried one himself in front of his friends. He performed 13 astavadhana between 1981‚Äì1987. In 1987, he gave a major astavadhana performance at Kolar in the centenary year of D. V. Gundappa, where thousands of people and several learned persons assembled. His 100th and 200th astavadhanas were also performed at Kolar, his native place. His astavadhanas became very popular and he gave hundreds of performances, some of which were viewed by people even in pouring rain. He has performed avadhanas using eight languages, including Sanskrit, Kannada and Telugu. He is also credited with introducing chitrakavya into avadhana, previously considered impossible to do in an avadhana. He has given more than 20 avadhana performances in American and European countries. He performed his first Shatavadhana at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bangalore on 15 December 1991. He did another one 15 days later, then one each again in 1992 and 1993, with his fifth, the first to be done entirely in Kannada, in 2012. In addition to his D. Litt thesis The Art of Avadhana in Kannada and the forthcoming Avadhana Sahasra, he has written books about the art of Avadhana to groom future avadhanis including 'Shatavadhana Sharade,Shatavadhana Srividye and Sataavadhaana shaashvati. He has also started lectures on poetry composition, prosody and poetics on the website of \\"Padyapaana\\" organisation. Other work He performed a shatavadhana in a single day in 1991. He also gives public lectures, on dance (nƒÅ·π≠ya ≈õƒÅstra), music, art, culture, literature, poetics, etc. In his kAvya-chitra shows, he performs with painter B.K.S.Varma, composing poems while the latter paints. He has also written lyrics and composed verses for dance performances. He learned the performance art Yakshagana and conceived the idea of eka vyakthi yakshagana (single-person Yakshagana), of which several performances have been given by Mantapa Prabhakara Upadhyaya. He has played the role of Horatio (dubbed Harshananda) in a Sanskrit production of Hamlet.

She was 17 years old at the time. Maitland's car was discovered the following day, backed into the side of an abandoned house about a mile (1.6 km) away from her workplace. She has not been seen or heard from since. Due to a confluence of circumstances, several days passed before Maitland's friends and family reported her missing. In the days and weeks following her disappearance, numerous tips were investigated by state law enforcement, including a claim that Maitland was being held captive in a house occupied by local drug dealers of whom she was an acquaintance; however, none of the tips resulted in her discovery. An alleged 2006 sighting of Maitland at a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, brought renewed interest to the case, but the woman seen was never properly identified. In 2012, law enforcement investigated a possible connection between Maitland's disappearance and serial killer Israel Keyes, who committed numerous rapes and murders in Vermont, New York, and throughout the Pacific Northwest, but he was ultimately ruled out as a suspect by the FBI. Maitland's case was profiled across various local media, on Dateline NBC, and the documentary series Disappeared. In 2017, the case was discussed in the documentary series on missing college student Maura Murray, who vanished a month prior to Maitland in Woodsville, New Hampshire. , Maitland's disappearance remains unsolved. Background =Early life= Brianna Maitland was born October 8, 1986 in Burlington, Vermont, to Bruce and Kellie Maitland (n√©e Fisher). She was raised with her older brother on their parents' farm in East Franklin, Vermont,Brianna Alexandra Maitland profile, charleyproject.org; accessed 6 February 2020. near the Canadian border. In her youth, she was extensively trained in jiu-jitsu. Maitland attended Missisquoi Valley Union High School before transferring to Enosburg Falls High School in nearby Enosburg Falls, during her sophomore year. =Prior to disappearance= On Maitland's seventeenth birthday in October 2003, she decided she wanted to move away from her parents' farm. Her mother, Kellie, said there were no serious stresses at home, but that Maitland wanted more independence, and to be closer to a group of friends who lived away and attended a different high school. Maitland enrolled at her friends' high school, but her living arrangements were unstable, as she moved in and out of several friends' homes. By the end of February 2004, she had dropped out of school and moved in with her childhood friend, Jillian Stout, in Sheldon, Vermont, approximately west of Montgomery. To complete her education, Maitland enrolled in a GED program. Three weeks prior to her disappearance, Maitland was physically attacked at a party by a former female friend, Keallie Lacross. The motive for the attack was unclear, though Brianna's father, Bruce, would later state that he believed it stemmed from jealousy over Maitland's interaction with a male peer at the party. One of Maitland's friends at the party claimed that Maitland, despite her martial arts training, refused to fight with Lacross, who subsequently hit her in the face several times while Maitland was seated in a truck. The altercation resulted in Maitland's suffering a broken nose and concussion; she later filed charges against Lacross. The complaint was subsequently dropped three weeks after Maitland disappeared, and police stated that Lacross was cleared of any involvement in her disappearance. Disappearance =Friday, March 19, 2004= Black Lantern Inn, Maitland's workplace and the last place she was seen alive On the morning of Friday, March 19, 2004, Maitland took an exam to receive her GED. After completing the test, she and her mother had lunch to celebrate the occasion; her father, Bruce, was out of state working in New York at the time. Her mother described her as being in good spirits, and that Maitland had discussed plans of attending college. After lunch, Maitland and her mother spent the afternoon shopping and running errands. While waiting in the check-out line of a store, Kellie said something outside caught Brianna's attention; she told her mother she would return shortly, and left the store. Kellie completed her purchase and met Brianna in the parking lot, and noticed that her daughter seemed unnerved, shaken, and agitated. She told her mother that she needed to go home and prepare for her upcoming work shift at the Black Lantern Inn, a restaurant in Montgomery. Not wanting to pry, Kellie did not ask what had happened, and dropped Brianna off at Stout's home between 3:30 and 4:00pm. This was the last time she saw her daughter. At some point before leaving for her work shift, Maitland left a note for Stout saying she'd return after work that evening. Maitland then departed for the Black Lantern Inn in a 1985 Oldsmobile sedan registered to Kellie. After completing her shift at work, Maitland clocked out and left the Black Lantern Inn at approximately 11:20 p.m. She told her co-workers she needed to get home and rest before working the next day at her second job in St. Albans. By all accounts Maitland was alone in her vehicle when she left. =Saturday, March 20, 2004= Discovery of vehicle Early the next afternoon, on March 20, a Vermont State Police trooper was dispatched to an abandoned house on Route 118 in Richford, about a mile from the Black Lantern Inn. Maitland's Oldsmobile was found backed into the side of the house. Known locally as \\"the old Dutchburn house,\\" the siding of the home had been breached by the rear end of the car. A piece of plywood that had been covering a window lay on the car's trunk. Two of Maitland's paychecks were on the front seat of the car, and outside it, law enforcement observed loose change, a water bottle, and an unsmoked cigarette. The trooper assumed the car had been abandoned by a drunk driver, and a towing company took the vehicle to a local garage. Maitland was not reported missing for a number of days. Her mother Kellie did not learn about the discovery of Maitland's car until five days afterward. Stout saw Maitland's note on Friday, March 19, spent the weekend away, and found the note undisturbed when she returned on Monday. Assuming Maitland was staying elsewhere, she did not call Kellie until the following day. On Tuesday, March 23, Kellie began calling various people in order to find Maitland, including friends as well as her employers, none of whom had seen or spoken to her. Failing in her efforts ‚Äî and still unaware that the vehicle Maitland had been driving had been recovered ‚Äî she filed a missing persons report that day. On Thursday, March 25, Maitland's parents gave photos of her to Vermont State Police in St. Albans. A trooper showed them a picture of the Oldsmobile found at the old Dutchburn house, upon which they immediately identified the car as their daughter's. Kellie said in interviews that she was \\"instinctively revulsed\\" by the photo, and believed someone else, not Maitland, had left the car in such a way. =Witness sightings= After Maitland's reported disappearance, several individuals came forward to law enforcement to report sightings of Maitland's vehicle at the old Dutchburn house the night she disappeared: * A man who drove by the house between 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. on March 19‚Äì20 said the car's headlights may have been on. He said he did not see anyone in or around the car. * A second man who drove by between midnight and 12:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 20, recalled seeing a turn signal flashing on the car. * Around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, March 20, a former boyfriend of Maitland's drove past the scene after a night of partying across the border in Canada. He thought he recognized the vehicle, but he did not see anyone in or around it. * The next morning, some passing motorists found the scene odd enough that they stopped and took pictures of it. One of the photographers reported some loose change, a water bottle, and a bracelet or necklace on the ground next to the car. Investigation =Initial findings= The Vermont State Police, who led the official investigation for the first months after Maitland's disappearance, were skeptical that foul play was involved, considering the possibility that Maitland was a runaway. The area surrounding the old Dutchburn house was combed on foot by police and search dogs, but nothing was found. Maitland's vehicle was processed by the state crime laboratory for evidence on March 30, 2004, after the car had been impounded at a local garage for several days. Upon the car's return to the Maitland family, Bruce noted that his daughter's ATM card, glasses, contact lens case, and migraine medication had all been left inside. It was later concluded by law enforcement that foul play was the probable cause of Maitland's disappearance, and a 2007 flyer provided by the FBI stated that the scene at which Maitland's car was discovered may have been staged to appear as an accident. Maitland's parents publicly speculated that she may have been abducted by multiple people, stating that it would have been difficult for a single assailant to subdue her given her jiu-jitsu training. The disappearance of Maura Murray, a college student from Massachusetts, in northwest New Hampshire the month before was deemed unrelated to Maitland's disappearance by law enforcement, in spite of the events occurring within of each other. In 2004, Maitland's family organized a website, now defunct, titled bringbrihome.org, with a posted maximum reward of USD$20,000 for information leading to her whereabouts. The website was active until at least 2009. According to a March 2017 article published in the Burlington Free Press, the reward remained available. In June 2017, however, it was reported that the reward was due to expire in early July of that year. =Allegations and affidavit= In the week following Maitland's disappearance, the Vermont State Police received an anonymous tip claiming that she was being held against her will in a house in nearby Berkshire, Vermont, from Montgomery. The rented house, then occupied by Ramon L. Ryans and Nathaniel Charles Jackson, two known drug dealers from New York, was raided by police on April 15, 2004. Various drug paraphernalia was discovered inside, as well as substantial amounts of cocaine and marijuana, but no sign of Maitland was found. Ryans was arrested during the raid for drug charges. Upon interviewing Maitland's close friends, law enforcement was informed that Maitland had allegedly experimented with hard drugs in the recent past, specifically crack cocaine, and was an acquaintance of Ryans and Jackson. In late 2004, police received a statement from an anonymous \\"older female\\" who implicated both Ryans and Jackson in Maitland's disappearance and alleged murder. The signed affidavit contained allegations, written in graphic detail, that Maitland had been murdered approximately a week after her disappearance. . The woman who provided the affidavit claimed that Ryans murdered Maitland during an argument over money she had lent him to purchase crack, and that her body had been temporarily stored in the basement of a recently incarcerated local woman's home; Maitland's body was then allegedly dismembered with a table saw and disposed of on a pig farm. Law enforcement was unable to corroborate the claims in the letter. The Maitland family additionally reported that they had received several uncorroborated anonymous phone calls from persons claiming Maitland was \\"tied to a tree in the woods,\\" and that she had been disposed of at the bottom of a lake. =Later developments= In 2006, security footage at the Caesars World casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey showed a woman resembling Maitland sitting at a poker table. The woman was never properly identified. In 2012, law enforcement investigated a potential connection between Maitland's disappearance and serial killer Israel Keyes, who committed numerous rapes and murders in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, as well as in Vermont and New York, where he owned property in Constable. The FBI ruled out Keyes's potential connection to Maitland's disappearance in late December 2012, shortly after Keyes committed suicide in Anchorage, Alaska. In March 2016, on the case's twelfth anniversary, investigators revealed to a local television station they had recovered DNA samples from Maitland's car. The results of the DNA tests were not made public. In July 2016, the farmhouse where Maitland's vehicle was discovered was destroyed in a fire. Media depictions Maitland's case has been profiled by Dateline NBC and on the Investigation Discovery documentary series Disappeared in December 2011. Maitland's disappearance was also mentioned in a 20/20. In 2016, her case was profiled on the podcast The Vanished. In 2017, her case was profiled in an episode of the documentary series The Disappearance of Maura Murray on the Oxygen network.

History Team of Sportivo Buenos Aires of 1928 The club was founded on 1 February 1918, when clubs Buenos Aires Isla Maciel and Sportivo Argentino merged. The Sportivo Argentino had been founded in 1915 by former players of Boca Juniors' youth and senior players separated from the club due to problems with its managers. The first name chosen for the club was \\"Petrolero\\" (\\"Oiler\\" in Spanish) but it was rejected by the Argentine Football Association so they changed to \\"Sportivo Argentino\\". Sportivo Buenos Aires affiliated to the Association in 1918 playing at the second division (then named \\"Divisi√≥n Intermedia\\") until 1920 when the team promoted to Primera Divisi√≥n to play at the \\"Asociaci√≥n Amateur de Football\\" (AAF), the amateur league. When football became professional in Argentina, Buenos Aires continued its tenure on the amateur league which lasted until 1934, when the AAF merged with the professional league. Sportivo Buenos Aires was relegated to the second division as well as all teams that took part in the AAF. The team continued to play in the second division until 1939 when it was relegated to the third division. Buenos Aires remained there until 1941 when the club disaffiliated from the Association. It is believed that the club was dissolved in the 1960s. Venues The first stadium was located in the Isla Maciel of Dock Sud district in Avellaneda Partido. In 1923 the club moved to La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires, in the same place where the River Plate stadium had been erected before moving to N√∫√±ez. The club's last location was on the corner of Alvarez Jonte and Sanabria streets in Floresta neighborhood, also in Buenos Aires. Notable players Most notable player for the club was striker Carlos Peucelle who played there from 1927 and 1930. He was acquired by River Plate in 1930 for $ 10,000, which was a huge amount of money by then. Due to this transaction River Plate was nicknamed The Millionaires, which has remained as the most distinctive nickname for both the club and its supporters. During his run on River Plate Peucelle played 307 matches scoring 113 goals. He also disputed with Argentina national team the 1930 World Cup held in Uruguay.\\"El primer √≠dolo\\", Ol√© sports newspaper References B B B ","title":"Club Sportivo Buenos Aires"},{"id":"36467919","text":"Lea Riders Group was a Swedish rock band with roots in Borgholm, Sweden. The band formed in 1961 when Hawkey Franz√©n started the Red River Band, a trio consisting of a drummer, accordionist and trumpet player, along with two of his friends. Additional members were added and after 1963, the Red River Band changed its name to Lea Riders Group. Many members came and went but founder and frontman Hawkey Franz√©n was the constant member in the band's lineup. After playing in schools and party places on the island of √ñland, in Kalmar, the rest of Sm√•land, Blekinge and √ñsterg√∂tland, the band got an opportunity to play in Stockholm in 1966. There they quickly built a name among students and youth, and the group became a popular indie band before the term had even been coined. Their first television appearance was in autumn 1966, when a live performance directed by Stefan Jarl and Jan Lindqvist was shown on SVT. A number of singles were recorded and released by Philips Records. It would once again collaborate with Jarl and Lindqvist when Lea Riders Group got to record some of the soundtrack to the film Dom Kallar Oss Mods. (\\"They Call Us Misfits\\" in English). Jarl and Lindqvist's choices for recording the soundtrack was between Lea Riders Group and a similar band called Baby Grandmothers. However the main theme was written and recorded by Lee Riders group that later was appearing on lists all around Europe. In the middle of 1968, most of the members deemed that gigs and jams were not going to move the band forward, and Franz√©n dissolved the group in May of that year. The band Made in Sweden was formed out of the ashes of Lea Riders Group by Bo H√§ggstr√∂m and Slim Borgudd. Well the real story was that Slim heard George play at a place called Sunside in a dance band named Stubinerna when Lea Riders was playing at the Golden Circle. So Slim asked Bosse to check out George, resulting inviting George to come up and jam. Well this resulted in George never stepped down and the trio Made in Sweden was formed. Music The Lea Rider Group's original instruments were replaced rather quickly to the more typical guitar, bass guitar, drums, piano/keyboards and harmonica. Despite this change, the band still occasionally played the accordion as the unusual instrument was well-liked by Franz√©n. The band had a broad song catalog and mixed many different styles of music during its relatively short career. They became famous in Sweden and abroad, as a \\"raw, gritty and authentic blues and R&B; group\\" in the style of similar blues-oriented British Invasion bands and American garage bands such as The Chocolate Watchband. The band's music also had psychedelic elements, pop influences and more melodic pieces. Discography Lea Riders Group never released any studio albums during the group's active years. The group's live radio recordings, however, were saved and an LP of live material and studio recordings were issued in 1989 on the small record label Garageland Records. The same material was released on CD in 1998. =Singles= *\\"Lost Love\\" / \\"Tryin\\" (1966) *\\"Got No Woman\\" / \\"But I Am, and Who Cares?\\" (1966) *\\"The Situation's Rare\\" / \\"Key To The Riddle\\" (1967) *\\"Is it Not Strange?\\" / \\"Beloved Baby\\" (1967) *\\"The Forgotten Generation\\" / \\"Dom Kallar Oss Mods\\" (\\"They Call Us Misfits\\") (1968) =Albums= *Lea Riders Group - The Forgotten Generation (LP 1989, CD 1998) External links *Hawkey Franz√©n's Lea Riders Group page *Progg.se - Hawkey Franz√©n page Swedish musical groups Swedish rock music groups Musical groups established in 1961 ","title":"Lea Riders Group"},{"id":"36467957","text":"Rafael Marques may refer to: *Rafael Marques (footballer, born 1983), Brazilian footballer who plays as a striker *Rafael Marques (footballer, born 1989), Portuguese footballer who plays as a goalkeeper *Rafael Marques (journalist) (born 1971), Angolan journalist and human rights activist *Rafa√´l Marques Dias Brito (born 1991), Portuguese footballer who plays as a midfielder *Rafael Marques Pinto (born 1983), Brazilian footballer who plays as a centre back See also *Rafael M√°rquez (disambiguation) ","title":"Rafael Marques"},{"id":"36467960","text":"The Oaks Airfield is an unlicensed private airfield located in The Oaks, New South Wales in the Wollondilly Shire, west of Sydney Australia. Originally built by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II, today the airfield caters mostly to recreational aircraft and flight training and is home to Dave's Flying School and the Sydney Recreational Flying Club. The airfield is a heritage listed site and is the only airport constructed during WWII to still be operational. Other airfields from the time in Sydney have either being converted or demolished, History The Oaks airfield was constructed in 1942 as a satellite field of Camden Airport, at the time a major operational base and RAAF station. The Oaks was built with a sealed runway and could function as a dispersal base to hide aircraft should the major bases in Sydney come under attack. The construction of Burragorang Road between the late 1940s and 1960 as the main access to Warragamba Dam cut across the original runway, and only the southern end of the site is still used for aviation purposes. The current owner purchased the airfield in 1975. In late 1981, the owner acquired a Hawker-Siddeley HS.125 training jet from Qantas and transported it to the field. The derelict jet has since become a popular attraction with aviation enthusiasts and photographers. In 1985, the Sydney Ultralight Flying Club (now Sydney Recreational Flying Club Inc.) was formed and began using The Oaks as a base for operations. On 21 September 2009, the Wollondilly Shire Council approved the construction of a telecommunications tower in McIntosh Street, The Oaks, within the circuit area for the airfield, at a distance of approximately from the runway edge. A judgement by the Supreme Court of New South Wales handed down on 10 February 2011 restricted the height of any tower on the approved site to be limited to a maximum height of thus reducing the impact on airport operations and the risk of a collision. Facilities and operations The airport has three grass runways, 2 parallel strips aligned north-south and a much shorter east-west strip just used only for emergencies. As the airport is not a licensed aerodrome and does not have a control tower, simultaneous operations on parallel runways are not permitted, so only one of these strips is in use at any one time, adopting the designation 18/36. The unused strip is allowed to lie fallow to maintain the runway surface. The airfield is generally restricted to aircraft with a Maximum Takeoff Weight under . There is no runway lighting so operations are limited to daylight hours. Pilots use non- controlled-aerodrones to coordinate arrivals and departures. The nearby, Oaks Township is an important landmark for visual flight rules pilots when approaching Camden Airport, placing this Aircraft Landing Area their approach- path. The primary user of The Oaks is Dave's Flying School, a Recreational Aviation Australia accredited flying school, which offers students an alternative to the congested Bankstown and Camden airports for initial flight training in the Sydney area. The Sydney Recreational Flying Club also uses the airfield, mainly on weekends. The Southern Cross Gliding Club regularly use The Oaks as an alternative field for training and emergency purposes. Approximately 80% of the movements at the airport (on average 200 per day) are conducted as flight training. The airfield is also used for balloon and parachute operations, as well as supporting aircraft operations by the New South Wales Police Force, National Parks and Wildlife Service and Australian Defence Force. The Oaks is an emergency alternative to Camden and Bankstown for general aviation traffic and there are no special permits required to land. Future The owner of the airfield has expressed a desire to restore the World War II site and incorporate an aviation and transport museum. As of 2009, the owner and management were working with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to upgrade The Oaks airfield as a registered airport to increase the scope of operations. Infrastructure Australia conducted analysis on a potential site close in the immediate vicinity of The Oaks Airfield for a second Sydney airport, however it was not selected as a suitable site.

The battle was fought between royalist forces, loyal to the Spanish crown, commanded by Juan Antonio Fuentes, and Mexican rebels, commanded by Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos and Rafael Valdovinos, fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. The rebels won.  Context  In 1811, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos arrived with his army to the area around Car√°cuaro, Michoac√°n de Ocampo and began to issue notices to the local population about the popular uprising initiated by Miguel Hidalgo, a movement Morelos himself had joined at Indaparapeo when he had previously met with Hidalgo. Hidalgo had named Morelos a lieutenant and commissioned him to operate in the south of the country where the important port city of Acapulco was situated. Upon his return to Car√°cuaro, Morelos raised his own army and traveled to the state of Guerrero to conduct his first military campaign which took place between October 1810 through August 1811. The battle With his stated intent to capture the strategic city of Acapulco de Ju√°rez, Morelos decided that it was vital to take the high ground at the Cerro del Veladero as this mountain surrounded the entire port city. Morelos sent 700 men, under the command of Captain Rafael Valdovinos, to take the mountain. Valdovinos was unable to initially take the mountain and was dislodged by royalist forces, losing his position on the mountain. Whilst these actions were taking place, the Guerrero brothers, Bravo and Vicente, arrived at the battle and bolstered the rebel forces with their own soldiers. The two sides took up strategic positions around El Valedero and Acapulco, with skirmishes occurring frequently between the two sides, until 30 April 1811 when the forces commanded by Morelos were able to overrun the mountaintop and force the Spanish forces to retreat.

He is most noted for being a minister at odds with Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy from 1636 to 1638, and for being an attending minister during the execution of Mary Dyer in 1660. Born into a prominent English family from Sudbury in Suffolk, his father was the chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and thus held a high position in the Anglican Church. Young Wilson was sent to school at Eton for four years, and then attended the university at King's College, Cambridge, where he received his B.A. in 1610. From there he studied law briefly, and then studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he received an M.A. in 1613. Following his ordination, he was the chaplain for some prominent families for a few years, before being installed as pastor in his home town of Sudbury. Over the next ten years he was dismissed and then reinstated on several occasions, because of his strong Puritan sentiments which contradicted the practices of the established church. As with many other Puritan divines, Wilson came to New England, and sailed with his friend John Winthrop and the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. He was the first minister of the settlers, who established themselves in Charlestown, but soon crossed the Charles River into Boston. Wilson was an encouragement to the early settlers during the very trying initial years of colonization. He made two return trips to England during his early days in Boston, the first time to persuade his wife to come, after she initially refused to make the trip, and the second time to transact some business. Upon his second return to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635, Anne Hutchinson was first exposed to his preaching, and found an unhappy difference between his theology and that of her mentor, John Cotton, who was the other Boston minister. The theologically astute, sharp- minded, and outspoken Hutchinson, who had been hosting large groups of followers in her home, began to criticize Wilson, and the divide erupted into the Antinomian Controversy. Hutchinson was eventually tried and banished from the colony, as was her brother-in-law, Reverend John Wheelwright. Following the controversy, Wilson and Cotton were able to work together to heal the divisions within the Boston church, but after Cotton's death more controversy befell Boston as the Quakers began to infiltrate the orthodox colony with their evangelists. Greatly opposed to their theology, Wilson supported the actions taken against them, and supervised the execution of his former parishioner, Mary Dyer in 1660. He died in 1667, the longest-lived of the early ministers in the Boston area, and his passing was lamented by those who knew him and worked with him, but he is also remembered for the roles he played in the persecution of those who did not embrace the Puritan orthodoxy.  Early life  John Wilson was born in Windsor, Berkshire, England about 1588, the son of the Reverend William Wilson (1542‚Äì1615). John's father, originally of Sudbury in Suffolk, was a chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund Grindal. His father was also a prebend of St Paul's in London, a minister in Rochester, Kent, and a rector of the parish of Cliffe, Kent. Wilson's mother was Isabel Woodhull, the daughter of John Woodhull and Elizabeth Grindal, and a niece of Archbishop Grindal. According to Wilson's biographer, A. W. M'Clure, Archbishop Grindal favored the Puritans to the extent of his power, to the displeasure of Queen Elizabeth. Eton College, where Wilson studied for four years Wilson was first formally educated at Eton College, where he spent four years, and at one time was chosen to speak a Latin oration during the visit of the duc de Biron, ambassador from the court of Henry IV of France. The duke then gave him a special gift of a gold coin called \\"three angels\\", worth about ten shillings. On 23 August 1605, at the age of 14, Wilson was admitted to King's College, Cambridge. While there he was initially prejudiced against the Puritans, but changed his stance after reading Richard Rogers' Seven Treatises (1604), and he subsequently traveled to Dedham to hear Rogers preach. He and other like-minded students frequently met to discuss theology, and he also regularly visited prisons to minister to the inmates. He received his B.A. from King's College in 1609/10, then studied law for a year at the Inns of Court in London. He next attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, noted for its Puritan advocacy, where he received his M.A. in 1613. While at Emmanuel, he likely formed a friendship with future New England divines, John Cotton and Thomas Hooker. He was probably soon ordained as a minister in the Anglican Church, but records of this event are not extant. In 1615 Wilson visited his dying father, who had these parting words for his son: \\"while thou wast at the university, because thou wouldst not conform, I fain would have brought thee to some higher preferment; but I see thy conscience is very scrupulous about somethings imposed in the church. Nevertheless, I have rejoiced to see the grace and fear of God in thy heart; and seeing thou hast hitherto maintained a good conscience, and walked according to thy light, do so still. Go by the rule of God's holy word, and the Lord bless thee.\\" Wilson preached for three years as the chaplain to several respectful families in Suffolk, one of them being the family of the Countess of Leicester. It was to her that he later dedicated his only book, Some Helps to Faith..., published in 1630. In time he was offered, and accepted, the position of minister at Sudbury, from where his family had originated. While there he met John Winthrop, and likely supported Winthrop's unsuccessful 1626 bid to become a member of Parliament. Wilson was suspended and then restored several times as minister, the issue being nonconformity (Puritan leanings) with the established practices of the Anglican Church. Like many Puritans, he began turning his thoughts toward New England.  Massachusetts  Wilson arrived in New England with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. Wilson was an early member of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and accompanied John Winthrop and the Winthrop Fleet to New England in 1630. As soon as they arrived, he, with Governor Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, and Isaac Johnson, entered into a formal and solemn covenant with each other to walk together in the fellowship of the gospel. Life was harsh in the new wilderness, and Plymouth historian Nathaniel Morton said that Wilson \\"bare a great share of the difficulties of these new beginnings with great cheerfulness and alacrity of spirit.\\" Wilson was chosen the pastor of their first church in Charlestown, being installed as teacher there on 27 August 1630, and in the same month the General Court ordered that a dwelling-house should be built for him at the public expense, and the governor and Sir Richard Saltonstall were appointed to put this into effect. By the same authority it was also ordered, that Wilson's salary, until the arrival of his wife, should be 20 pounds a year. After the Charlestown church was established, most of its members moved across the Charles River to Boston, after which services were held alternately on each side of the river, and then later only in Boston. Well before leaving England, Wilson was married to Elizabeth Mansfield, the daughter of Sir John Mansfield, and had at least two children born in England, but his wife had initially refused to come to New England with him. Her refusal was the subject of several letters sent from John Winthrop's wife, Margaret, to her son John Winthrop Jr., in May 1631. Wilson then made a trip back to England from 1631 to 1632. Though his biographer, in 1870, stated that she still did not come back to New England with Wilson until 1635, Anderson in 1995 pointed out that the couple had a child baptized in Boston in 1633; therefore she had to have come with Wilson during this earlier trip. On 2 July 1632 Wilson was admitted as a freeman of the colony, and later the same month the first meeting house was built in Boston. For this and Wilson's parsonage, the congregation made a voluntary contribution of 120 pounds. On 25 October 1632 Wilson, with Governor Winthrop and a few other men, set out on a friendly visit to Plymouth where they were hospitably received. They held a worship service on the Sabbath, and that same afternoon they met again, and engaged in a discussion centered around a question posed by the Plymouth teacher, Roger Williams. William Bradford, the Plymouth governor, and William Brewster, the ruling elder, spoke, after which Governor Winthrop and Wilson were invited to speak. The Boston men returned the following Wednesday, with Winthrop riding Governor Bradford's horse. On 23 November, Wilson, who had previously been ordained teacher, was installed as minister of the First Church of Boston. In 1633 the church at Boston received another minister, when John Cotton arrived and was installed as teacher. In November 1633 Wilson made one of his many visits outside Boston, and went to Agawam (later Ipswich), since the settlers there did not yet have a minister. He also visited the natives, tending to their sick, and instructing others who were capable of understanding him. In this regard he became the first Protestant missionary to the North American native people, a work later to be carried on with much success by Reverend John Eliot. Closer to home, Wilson sometimes led groups of Christians, including magistrates and other ministers, to the church lectures in nearby towns, sharing his \\"heavenly discourse\\" during the trip. In late 1634, Wilson made his final trip to England, leaving the ministry of the Boston Church in the hands of his co-pastor, John Cotton, and traveling with John Winthrop Jr. While returning to England he had a harrowing experience off the coast of Ireland during some violent winter weather, and though other ships perished, his landed. During his journey across Ireland and England, Wilson was able to minister to many people, and tell them about New England. In his journal, John Winthrop noted that while in Ireland, Wilson \\"gave much satisfaction to the Christians there about New England.\\" Leaving England for the final time on 10 August 1635, Wilson arrived back in New England on the third of October. Soon after his return, M'Clure writes, \\"the Antinomian Controversy broke out and raged for two...years and with a fury that threatened the destruction of his church.\\"  Antinomian Controversy  Wilson first became acquainted with Anne Hutchinson when in 1634, as the minister of the Boston Church, he was notified of some heterodox views that she revealed while en route to New England on the ship Griffin. A minister aboard the ship was questioned by her in such a way as to cause him some alarm, and word was sent to Wilson. In conference with his co-minister in Boston, the Reverend John Cotton, Hutchinson was examined, and deemed suitable for church membership, though admitted a week later than her husband because of initial uncertainty. John Cotton shared the ministry with Wilson at the Boston church. When Wilson returned from his England trip in 1635, he was accompanied aboard the ship Abigail by two other people who would play a role in the religious controversy to come. One of these was the Reverend Hugh Peter, who became the minister in Salem, and the other was a young aristocrat, Henry Vane, who soon became the governor of the colony. In the pulpit, Wilson was said to have a voice that was harsh and indistinct and his demeanor was directed at strict discipline, but he had a penchant for rhymes, and would frequently engage in word play. He was unpopular during his early days of preaching in Boston, partly attributable to his strictness in teaching, and partly from his violent and arbitrary manner. His gruff style was further highlighted by the mild qualities of John Cotton, with whom he shared the church's ministry. When Wilson returned to Boston in 1635, Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and immediately saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his. She found his emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of \\"evidencing justification by sanctification\\" (a covenant of works) to be repugnant, and she told her followers that Wilson lacked \\"the seal of the Spirit.\\" Wilson's doctrines were shared with all of the other ministers in the colony, except for Cotton, and the Boston congregation had grown accustomed to Cotton's lack of emphasis on preparation \\"in favor of stressing the inevitability of God's will.\\" The positions of Cotton and Wilson were matters of emphasis, and neither minister believed that works could help to save a person. It is likely that most members of the Boston church could not see much difference between the doctrines of the two men, but the astute Hutchinson could, prompting her to criticize Wilson at her home gatherings. Probably in early 1636 he became aware of divisions within his own Boston congregation, and soon came to realize that Hutchinson's views were widely divergent from those of the orthodox clergy in the colony. Wilson said nothing of his discovery, but instead preached his covenant of works even more vehemently. As soon as Winthrop became aware of what was happening, he made an entry in his journal about Hutchinson, who did \\"meddle in such things as are proper for men, whose minds are stronger.\\" He also noted the 1636 arrival in the colony of Hutchinson's in-law who became an ally in religious opinion: \\"There joined with her in these opinions a brother of hers, one Mr. Wheelwright, a silenced minister sometimes in England.\\" = Meetings of the ministers = Henry Vane was furious over Wilson's \\"sad speech,\\" which cast aspersions on Reverend Cotton. In October 1636 the ministers, realizing that a theological tempest was forming in the colony, decided to get to the heart of the issue, and held a series of meetings, which also included Hutchinson and some of the magistrates. In order to deal with the theological errors of the Hutchinson group, the ministers first had to come to a consensus about their own positions, and this they were unable to do. Hutchinson's followers used this impasse to attempt to have Wheelwright appointed as another minister to the Boston church, an expression of their dissatisfaction with Wilson. Winthrop came to Wilson's rescue, as an elder in the church, by invoking a ruling requiring unanimity in a church vote, and was thus able to forestall Wheelwright's appointment there. Instead, Wheelwright was sent about ten miles south to Mount Wollaston to preach. As the meetings continued into December 1636, the theological debate escalated. Wilson delivered \\"a very sad speech of the condition of our churches,\\" insinuating that Cotton, his fellow Boston minister, was partly responsible for the dissension. Wilson's speech was moved to represent the sense of the meeting, and was approved by all of the ministers and magistrates present with the notable exceptions of Governor Vane, Reverend Cotton, Reverend Wheelwright, and two strong supporters of Hutchinson, William Coddington and Richard Dummer. Cotton, normally of a very placid disposition, was indignant over the proceedings and lead a delegation to admonish Wilson for his uncharitable insinuations. On Saturday, 31 December 1636, the Boston congregants met to prefer charges against Wilson. Governor Vane launched the attack, and was joined by other members of the congregation. Wilson met the onslaught with a quiet dignity, and responded soberly to each of the accusations brought against him. The crowd refused to accept his excuses, and demanded a vote of censure. At this point Cotton intervened, and with more restraint than his parishioners, offered that without unanimity a vote of censure was out of order. While the ultimate indignity of censure was averted, Cotton nevertheless gave a grave exhortation to his colleague to allay the temper of the congregants. The next day Wilson preached such a conciliatory sermon that even Governor Vane rose and voiced his approval. = \\"Dung cast on their faces\\" = The Boston congregants, followers of Hutchinson, were now emboldened to seize the offensive and discredit the orthodox doctrines at services throughout the colony. The saddened Winthrop lamented, \\"Now the faithfull Ministers of Christ must have dung cast on their faces, and be not better than legall Preachers.\\" As Hutchinson's followers attacked ministers with questions calculated to diminish confidence in their teachings, Winthrop continued his lament, \\"so many objections made by the opinionists...against our doctrine delivered, if it suited not their new fancies.\\" When Wilson rose to preach or pray, the Hutchinsonians boldly rose and walked out of the meeting house. While Wilson was the favorite butt of this abuse, it was not restricted just to the Boston church, and similar gestures were being made toward the other ministers who preached a covenant of works. John Winthrop, after lamenting the attacks on the ministers, was buoyed by the results of the 1637 election In hopes of bringing the mounting crisis under control, the General Court called for a day of fasting and repentance to be held on Thursday, 19 January 1637. During the Boston church service held that day, Cotton invited Wheelwright to come forward and deliver a sermon. Instead of the hoped-for peace, the opposite transpired. In the sermon Wheelwright stated that those who taught a covenant of works were Antichrists, and all the ministers besides Cotton saw this as being directed at them, though Wheelwright later denied this. During a meeting of the General Court in March Wheelwright was questioned at length, and ultimately charged with sedition, though not sentenced. = Election of May 1637 = The religious division had by now become a political issue, resulting in great excitement during the elections of May 1637. The orthodox party of the majority of magistrates and ministers maneuvered to have the elections moved from Boston to Newtown (later Cambridge) where the Hutchinsonians would have less support. The Boston supporters of Hutchinson wanted a petition to be read before the election, but the orthodox party insisted on holding the election first. Tempers flared, and bitter words gave way to blows as zealots on both sides clamored to have their opinions heard. During the excitement, Reverend Wilson was lifted up into a tree, and he bellowed to the crowd below, imploring them to look at their charter, to which a cry went out for the election to take place. The crowd then divided, with a majority going to one end of the common to hold the election, leaving the Boston faction in the minority by themselves. Seeing the futility of resisting further, the Boston group joined in the election. The election was a sweeping victory for the orthodox party, with Henry Vane replaced by Winthrop as governor, and Hutchinson supporters William Coddington and Richard Dummer losing their positions as magistrates. Soon after the election, Wilson volunteered to be the minister of a military unit that went to Connecticut to settle the conflict with the Pequot Indians. When he returned to Boston on 5 August, two days after Vane boarded a ship for England, never to return, Wilson was summoned to take part in a synod of all the colony's ministers. Many theological issues needed to be put to rest, and new issues that arose during the course of the controversy had to be dealt with. = Trials of Hutchinson = While Wilson had little to say during Hutchinson's civil trial, he delivered the final pronouncement at her church trial. By late 1637, the conclusion of the controversy was beginning to take shape. During the court held in early November, Wheelwright was finally sentenced to banishment, the delay caused by the hopes that he would, at some point, recant. On 7 November the trial of Anne Hutchinson began, and Wilson was there with most of the other ministers in the colony, though his role was somewhat restrained. During the second day of the trial, when things seemed to be going in her favor, Hutchinson insisted on making a statement, admitting that her knowledge of things had come from a divine inspiration, prophesying her deliverance from the proceedings, and announcing that a curse would befall the colony. This was all that her judges needed to hear, and she was accused of heresy and sentenced to banishment, though she would be held in detention for four months, awaiting a trial by the clergy. While no statements made by Wilson were recorded in either existing transcript of this trial, Wilson did make a speech against Hutchinson at the end of the proceedings, to which Hutchinson responded with anger four months later during her church trial. Her church trial took place at the Boston meeting house on two consecutive Thursdays in March 1638. Hutchinson was accused of numerous theological errors of which only four were covered during the first day, so the trial was scheduled to continue the following week, when Wilson took an active part in the proceedings. During this second day of interrogation a week later, Hutchinson read a carefully written recantation of her theological errors. Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in communion with the church, with the possibility of even returning there some day. Wilson, however, did not accept this recantation, and he re-opened a line of questioning from the previous week. With this, a new onslaught began, and when later given the opportunity, Wilson said, \\"[The root of]... your errors...is the slightinge of Gods faythfull Ministers and contenminge and cryinge down them as Nobodies.\\" Hugh Peter chimed in, followed by Thomas Shepard, and then Wilson spoke again, \\"I cannot but reverence and adore the wise hand of God...in leavinge our sister to pride and Lyinge.\\" Then John Eliot made his statement, and Wilson resumed, \\"Consider how we cane...longer suffer her to goe on still in seducinge to seduce, and in deacevinge to deaceve, and in lyinge to lye!\\" As the battering continued, even Cotton chided her, and while concerns from the congregation brought pause to the ministers, the momentum still remained with them. When the final points of order were addressed, it was left to Wilson to deliver the final blow: \\"The Church consentinge to it we will proced to excommunication.\\" He then continued, \\"Forasmuch as you, Mrs. Hutchinson, have highly transgressed and offended...and troubled the Church with your Errors and have drawen away many a poor soule, and have upheld your Revelations; and forasmuch as you have made a Lye...Therefor in the name of our Lord Je[sus] Ch[rist]...I doe cast you out and...deliver you up to Sathan...and account you from this time forth to be a Hethen and a Publican...I command you in the name of Ch[rist] Je[sus] and of this Church as a Leper to withdraw your selfe out of the Congregation.\\"  Later years  Hutchinson left the colony within a week of her excommunication, and following this conclusion of the Antinomian Controversy, Wilson worked with Cotton to reunite the Boston church. Following Cotton's death in 1652, his position was filled, following four years of campaigning, by John Norton from Ipswich. Norton held this position until his death in 1663. Wilson was an early advocate of the conversion of Indians to Christianity, and acted on this belief by taking the orphaned son of Wonohaquaham, a local sagamore into his home to educate. In 1647 he visited the \\"praying Indians\\" of Nonantum, and noticed that they had built a house of worship that Wilson described as appearing \\"like the workmanship of an English housewright.\\" During the 1650s and 1660s, in order to boost declining membership in the Boston church, Wilson supported a ruling known as the Half-Way Covenant, allowing parishioners to be brought into the church without having had a conversion experience. In 1656, Wilson and John Norton were the two ministers of the Boston church when the widow Ann Hibbins was convicted of witchcraft by the General Court and executed in Boston. Hibbins' husband died in 1654, and the unhappy widow was first tried the next year following complaints of her neighbors about her behavior. Details of the event are lacking, because the great Boston journalist, John Winthrop was dead, and the next generations of note takers, Increase Mather and Cotton Mather had not yet emerged. A 1684 letter, however, survives, written by a Reverend Beach in Jamaica to Increase Mather in New England. In the letter Beach stated that he, Wilson and others were guests at Norton's table when Norton made the statement that the only reason Hibbins was executed was because she had more wit than her neighbors, thus implying her innocence. The sentiments of Wilson are not specifically expressed in the letter, though several writers have inferred that his sentiments were the same as Norton's.  Execution of Mary Dyer  Wilson exhorted Mary Dyer to repent, but it was her goal to hang as a martyr. In the 1650s Quaker missionaries began filtering into the Massachusetts Bay Colony, mostly from Rhode Island, creating alarm among the colony's magistrates and ministers, including Wilson. In 1870, M'Clure wrote that Wilson \\"blended an intense love of truth with as intense a hatred of error\\", referring to the Quakers' marked diversion from Puritan orthodoxy. On 27 October 1659 three Quakers--Marmaduke Stevenson, William Robinson and Mary Dyer--were led to the Boston gallows from the prison where they had been recently held for their Quaker evangelism, against which Massachusetts had enacted very strict laws. Wilson, now nearly 70, as pastor of the Boston church was on hand as the supervising minister. As the two Quaker men first approached the gallows, wearing hats, Wilson said to Robinson, \\"Shall such jacks as you come in before authority with your hats on?\\" Ignoring the barb, Robinson then let forth a barrage of words, to which Wilson angrily responded, \\"Hold thy tongue, be silent; thou art going to die with a lie in your mouth.\\" The two Quaker men were then hanged, after which it was Dyer's turn to ascend the ladder. As the noose was fastened about her neck, and her face covered, a young man came running and shouting, wielding a document which he waved before the authorities. Governor Endecott had stayed her execution. After the two executions had taken place, Wilson was said to have written a ballad about the event, which was sung by young men around Boston. Not willing to let public sentiment over the executions subside, Dyer knew that she had to go through with her martyrdom. After the winter she returned to the Bay Colony in May 1660, and was immediately arrested. On the 31st of the month she was brought before Endecott, who questioned her briefly, and then pronounced her execution for the following day. On 1 June, Dyer was once again led to the gallows, and while standing at the hanging tree for the final time, Wilson, who had received her into the Boston church 24 years earlier and had baptized her son Samuel, called to her. His words were, \\"Mary Dyer, O repent, O repent, and be not so deluded and carried away by deceit of the devil.\\" Her reply was, \\"Nay, man, I am not now to repent.\\" With these final words, the ladder was kicked away, and she died when her neck snapped.  Death and legacy  Richard Mather was one of several ministers remembered in Wilson's 1667 will. Wilson's final years were marked by a prolonged illness. In his will, dated 31 May 1667, Wilson remembered a large number of people, among them being several of the local ministers, including Richard Mather of Dorchester and Thomas Shepard Jr. of Charlestown. He died on 7 August 1667, and his son-in-law Samuel Danforth wrote, \\"About two of the clock in the morning, my honored Father, Mr. John Wilson, Pastor to the church of Boston, aged about 78 years and an half, a man eminent in faith, love, humility, self-denial, prayer, sound[n]ess of mind, zeal for God, liberality to all men, esp[ecial]ly to the s[ain]ts & ministers of Christ, rested from his labors & sorrows, beloved & lamented of all, and very honorably interred the day following.\\" His funeral sermon was preached by local divine, Increase Mather, and he was buried in the King's Chapel Burying Ground in Boston. Wilson was notable for making anagrams based on the names of his friends and acquaintances. M'Clure described them as numerous and nimble, and if not exact, they were always instructive, and he would rather force a poor match than lose the moral. An anecdote given by Wilson biographer M'Clure, whether true or not, points to the character of Wilson: a person met Wilson returning from a journey and remarked, \\"Sir, I have sad news for you: while you have been abroad, your house is burnt.\\" To this Wilson is reputed to have replied, \\"Blessed be God! He has burnt this house, because he intends to give me a better.\\" In 1809 historian John Eliot called Wilson affable in speech, but condescending in his deportment. An early mentor of his, Dr. William Ames, wrote, \\"that if he might have his option of the best condition this side of heaven, it would be [to be] the teacher of a congregational church of which Mr. Wilson was pastor.\\" Plymouth historian Nathaniel Morton called him \\"eminent for love and zeal\\" and M'Clure wrote that his unfeigning modesty was excessive. In this vein, M'Clure wrote that Wilson refused to ever sit for a portrait and his response to those who suggested he do so was \\"What! Such a poor vile creature as I am! Shall my picture be drawn? I say No; it never shall.\\" M'Clure then suggested that the line drawing of Wilson in the Massachusetts Historical Society was made after his death. Cotton Mather, the noted Puritan who was a grandson of both Richard Mather and John Cotton wrote of Wilson, \\"If the picture of this good, and therein great man, were to be exactly given, great zeal, with great love, would be the two principal strokes that, joined with orthodoxy, should make up his portraiture.\\"  Family  Wilson's wife, Elizabeth, was a sister of Anne Mansfield, the wife of the wealthy Captain Robert Keayne of Boston, who made a bequest to Elizabeth in his 1656 will. With his wife, Wilson had four known children, the oldest of whom, Edmund, returned to England, married, and had children. Their next child, John Jr., attended Harvard College in 1642 and married Sarah Hooker, the daughter of the Reverend Thomas Hooker. The Wilsons then had two daughters, the older of whom, Elizabeth, married Reverend Ezekiel Rogers of Rowley, and then died while pregnant with their first child. The younger daughter, Mary, who was born in Boston on 12 September 1633, married first Reverend Samuel Danforth, and following his death she married Joseph Rock.

Annie (Alison Brie) hosts a Dia de los Muertos party, the success of which depends on Jeff (Joel McHale) attending. At the party, Pierce gets high, causing trouble for the other characters. Jeff pursues their statistics professor, Professor Michelle Slater (Lauren Stamile). Finally, Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) is distressed due to her ex-husband's behavior. Plot Annie announces to the Spanish class that she will be hosting a Dia de los Muertos party for extra credit later that night. Annie hopes everyone will attend the Mexican Halloween party, especially Jeff, believing his popularity will influence others to come. Jeff checks in with Britta (Gillian Jacobs) to make sure that she does not see anything ever happening between them because he has decided to ask out his statistics professor. After Britta confirms this, Jeff waits after his statistics class that afternoon to ask Professor Michelle Slater (Lauren Stamile) out, but is rejected when she states that she does not date students. Annie catches up with Jeff in the hallway to make sure he agrees to come to her party. When he hesitates, Annie breaks down in tears while remembering her lack of popularity in high school, stating that crossing guards would lure her into traffic. Jeff agrees to stop by. At the Halloween party, the study group is dressed in their Halloween costumes: Britta came as a modest squirrel, Troy (Donald Glover) as Eddie Murphy, Abed (Danny Pudi) as Batman, Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) as Harry Potter, and Pierce (Chevy Chase) as Beastmaster. Jeff does not wear a costume. Senor Chang (Ken Jeong), dressed as a matador, lets Jeff know that his professor crush is attending the faculty party in the cafeteria. Starburns (Dino Stamatopoulos) runs into Pierce, who is in the bathroom taking his medication. Starburns suggests Pierce trade some of his pills for the ones that Starburns has; Pierce, trying to act cool, agrees. Jeff asks Senor Chang to make him his \\"plus one\\" to the faculty party so he can see Professor Slater. Chang agrees, once Jeff offers him 20 dollars. Jeff quietly grabs his coat and leaves Annie's party before anyone notices. Annie gathers everyone from the party in a circle to start the dancing. She invites Jeff up to have the first dance of the night with her. Once everyone realizes Jeff has left the party, people threaten to leave. Britta tries to cover for him, enlisting Shirley to help get him back. Pierce, meanwhile, is high on Starburns' pills and begins hitting on Annie, who rebuffs his advances. Jeff makes it into the faculty Halloween party wearing a cowboy costume. He finds Professor Slater dressed in a revealing Robin Hood outfit and immediately makes advances on her. Britta interrupts their conversation in an attempt to convince Jeff to go back to Annie's party. Meanwhile, Abed and Troy need help dealing with Pierce, and Shirley defaces Professor Slater's car out of anger. Britta then catches Shirley in Professor Slater's office with a water hose, at which point Shirley breaks down and confesses that her anger has to do with her ex-husband and not Professor Slater. Pierce begins to lose control because of the drugs, driving everyone out of the party. Back at the faculty party, Chang gives Jeff some advice to boost his ego so he can continue wooing Professor Slater. After talking to Chang, Jeff approaches Professor Slater and tries an honest, direct, self- deprecating approach. Professor Slater agrees to sleep with him. As Jeff and Professor Slater leave the faculty party together, they walk by the library, where Pierce has barricaded himself in with office furniture. Jeff tries to ignore Pierce's cries for help, but agrees to walk away from Slater to help his friends. Jeff enters the fortress, where he successfully calms Pierce down. The fortress begins to collapse on top of Jeff and Pierce, but Abed, dressed as Batman, comes to rescue them. The episode ends with Jeff dancing with Annie as Abed narrates as Batman over the proceedings.  Reception  In its original broadcast this episode was viewed by 5.32 million. The episode was met with positive reviews. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode positively with A- and liked the exploration of the characters, \\"I feel like we're going to get more backstory that explains everything about [Britta], but at the same time, I‚Äôm really enjoying how the show is gradually filling in both who she is and who she wants to be. But I feel like the show is doing that with all of the characters by this point.\\" Sean Gandert of Paste rated it 9.1/10 saying the episode, \\"shows off how silly, unique, and flat-out hilarious the show can be.\\" Jonah Krakow of IGN rated the episode 8/10 with \\"But this [episode] got things back on track by once again making Jeff (Joel McHale) the center of attention and giving his supporting cast the opportunity to provide solid laughs in short, razor-sharp bursts.\\" Alan Sepinwall likewise felt the episode represented a comeback after a string of disappointing episodes, remarking, \\"That's more like it. 'Introduction to Statistics' was the strongest episode the show's done in several weeks. It made good use of the whole ensemble, giving every character a chance to shine without anyone's schtick feeling overdone.\\" He praised the episode as an effective mix of \\"character-driven conflict ..., broad comedy ..., random pop culture references ... and sharp dialogue,\\" illustrating each element of the mix with his favorite examples from the episode.Alan Sepinwall. \\"Community, Introduction to Statistics: trips and treats,\\" What Alan's Watching, October 29, 2009. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic praised Danny Pudi's character as the highlight of the episode with, \\"As funny as those plot lines were [...] it was actually Abed dressed as Batman in the background that won us over.\\" Sepinwall likewise named Abed's Batman as an example of judicious use of quirky character material, and added that he was enjoying the show's use of Abed/Troy scenes as closers given that the two actors \\"work so well together that it seems right they get these weird little showcases. In a retrospective towards the end of season 4, Josh Sorokach of Vulture remarked that the episode was the first to hint at \\"the shape of absurdity to come\\" with a balance between capers and emotional stakes.

The battle resulted in a victory for the Spanish royalists. The battle In early May 1811, the Spanish Brigadier General, Miguel Emparan, at the head of 3,000 men with the colonels Pedro Garc√≠a Conde and the Count of House Rule as his second in commands, pursued the army of Ignacio L√≥pez Ray√≥n through the state of Aguascalientes. The Spanish caught up with the Mexican rebels in the area around the ranch of El Maguey on 3 May. Ray√≥n sent his infantry, baggage and supplies to the town of La Piedad de Cavadas, but remained in his position at El Maguey with 14 pieces of artillery and a cavalry picket to fight a rearguard action against the overwhelming advancing Spanish forces. The stand was meant to give his infantry time to escape their pursuers so they could make an organized retreat from the Spanish. General Emparan gave battle and the two armies maneuvered for position around the ranch. Ray√≥n took advantage of the confusion caused by the smoke and dust in the air and fled the action whilst Emparan continued his advance. In the end, the royalists were able to successfully take possession of all the rebel cannon left behind on the battlefield.

Bennington Public Schools, Elkhorn Public Schools, Potter-Dix Public Schools, and Riverside Public Schools were also named as Excellent districts. The new state system, Accountability for a Quality Education System, Today and Tomorrow (Accountability for a Quality Education System, Today and Tomorrow), designates all public school districts and school buildings as Excellent, Great, Good, or Needs Improvement. Auburn High School and Auburn Middle School were named as Excellent buildings. Calvert Elementary was classified as a Great building. The overall rating includes measures from two areas ‚Äî academic and effective instructional practices. AQuESTT focuses first on classifying schools and districts using state test scores, graduation rates, student participation rates, and year-to-year improvement and growth ‚Äì criteria that were used in the state's past accountability system. The second component goes even further. Under AQuESTT, districts and schools are required to self-assess their practices embedded in six tenets for successful schooling. These tenets are 1) Positive School Partnerships and Relationships and Student Success, 2) Transitions between grades and school buildings, 3) Educational Opportunities and Access, 4) College and Career Readiness, 5) Multiple Assessments, and 6) Educator Effectiveness. Each tenet is evaluated on a 0-3 scale: Not at All - 0; Limited Extent ‚Äì 1; Moderate Extent - 2; and Great Extent - 3. AQuESTT encourages schools to focus on every student every day and to build a system for continuous school improvement that supports students, educators and the school learning environment.  Nebraska Performance Accountability System  NePAS was Nebraska's testing accountability system prior to 2015. NePAS was developed to report how students in each of Nebraska's 249 school districts scored on statewide reading, math, science and writing tests. NePAS provided numerous rankings in four grade level configurations: grades 3-5; grades 6-8; grades 9-12; and district (grades 3-12). Within each grade level, districts received separate rankings for each statewide test: NeSA-Reading, NeSA-Math, NeSA-Science, and NeSA-Writing. These results can be found in the Status section of NePAS, which provides 15 rankings. Auburn Public Schools' district rankings in 2012 fell within the following percentages: * Top 10% - 2 indicators * Top 20% - 5 indicators * Top 25% - 9 indicators * Top 33.3% - 11 indicators * Top 50 % - 14 indicatorshttp://www.education.ne.gov/ When compared to schools of similar size in Nebraska, Auburn High School ranked 3rd in writing, 5th in science, and 10th in reading and math.

The steps are located at the corner of Prospect St and 36th St NW, leading down to M Street NW, and were built in 1895 during construction of the adjacent Car Barn. For The Exorcist, the steps were padded with half-inch-thick rubber to film the death of the character Father Damien Karras. Because the house from which Karras falls was set back slightly from the steps, the film crew constructed an extension with a false front to the house in order to film the scene.

Biography He studied medicine in Leuven, receiving his doctorate in 1849 . He was the son of Pieter Jan Willems, a gin distiller and the mayor of Hasselt between 1836 and 1842. His statue stands next to the National Genever Museum in Hasselt. Because of the gin industry the area around Hasselt had a large amount of livestock, as the waste products, fermented grains, were used to fatten cattle. An outbreak occurred around 1828 in Belgium of a lung plague, described as being like the farmer's disease. In 1833 the disease reached the Netherlands, particularly in the so-called \\"flushing district\\" in and around Schiedam. It reached Hasselt in 1838. It was contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, a disease that still occurred in outbreaks at the end of the twentieth century, such as France in 1980. In Australia a national eradication program led to disease-free status by 1973. In Asia, Africa, the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe in the late twentieth century, the disease was still present. It not until 1898 that the described causality was accepted. This disease, which ravaged livestock, hit the income of the Willems' family itself. Interested by a competition from the Academie Royale de Medecine de Belgique, the graduate physician focused on these issues, and he began re-training at the √âcole nationale v√©t√©rinaire d'Alfort near Paris, gaining further knowledge in the Netherlands and Germany. Soon he discovered in the lungs of diseased animals, microscopic organisms (genus Mycoplasma), which he labelled as agents of the disease (now known as Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides biotype small colony). Analogous with the treatment of smallpox, he injected an extract of the affected bovine lungs (pus) into the posterior end of laboratory animals, which produced a local infection that prevented the lung disease. The first method, namely injections in the abdomen of the cattle, all too often led to infection and death of the \\"treated\\" animals. He systematically investigated relocation of the vaccination site and also found that new injections had little additional negative effect. Dogs, sheep, chickens, rabbits and turkeys did not show a disease from the antigen, and he came to the conclusion that it was not insanitary conditions, but an internal agent peculiar to cattle that caused the epidemic. When he found that the organisms from the lungs of the diseased animals do not develop in animals, he decided that \\"an unspecified substance from the extract caused lung immunity.\\" Thus he described for the first time the immunity principle. In 1852 he wrote down his experiences and findings in a penciled letter to the then Minister of Interior, Charles Rogier. Following this letter a committee was established to investigate his findings. There was a worldwide controversy, with supporters and opponents in France, Germany, South Africa, Australia, the United States and Russia. At the time, there was still no consensus in medical circles about the causes of what, after the work of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, was generally described as infectious diseases: plague, tuberculosis, etc. Only in 1864 was the merit of his work recognized, and his ideas spread throughout Europe, Southern Africa and Australia, even though it was still a long time before the disease mechanism had been clearly defined. In a letter dated June 29, 1880 to Willems (Archives Beveren-Waas) Pasteur wrote: > I saw the very interesting corpuscles that you previously reported it, and > have some tests done to them to cultivate, so far without result. reportedly > are you there succeeded. I look forward to your publications in this regard. > I thank Mr. Bouley me by you in touch, and by whom I very much > appreciated've applied for your wonderful discovery of preventive > inoculation against infectious Pleuropneumonia. It was not until around 1900 before the vaccinations were widely accepted in scientific circles. Meanwhile, the vaccination methods were refined, and instead of requiring the extracts of diseased lungs, real vaccines were soon developed. Status Dr. Willems is considered one of the founders of bacteriology and immunology. In Diepenbeek the Dr. L. Willems Institute was established for both animal and human reproductive research. One of the many merits of this institute is the pioneering work it has done in the field of research on multiple sclerosis. The museum statue. It is the letter from William to the Minister, but also the crown of the Virga Jesse in Hasselt people who donated to the Virgin in gratitude for ridding the city of the bovine disease. In September 2002, a statue of Louis Willems of Hasselt by artist Luc Steegen was aptly placed behind the Provincial Library. This is where the paddock for the ancestral home of Doctor Willems would have been and where his animals grazed.

The area is primarily residential, but includes some commercial districts, including Five Points, the King Street District, and the Shoppes of Avondale. Riverside was first platted in 1868 and was annexed by Jacksonville in 1887. Its greatest growth occurred between the Great Fire of 1901 and the failure of the 1920s Florida land boom; this period included the creation of the original Avondale development in 1920. Today, Riverside and Avondale are notable for their particularly diverse architecture and their emphasis on planning and historic preservation, which have made them Florida's most architecturally varied neighborhood. Both neighborhoods are listed as National Register Historic Districts. Geography Riverside and Avondale are located to the southwest of Downtown Jacksonville along the St. Johns River. The neighborhood's boundaries are roughly Interstate 10 to the north, the St. Johns River to the east, Fishweir Creek to the south, and Roosevelt Boulevard and the CSX Railroad line to the west. It borders the Brooklyn and North Riverside neighborhoods to the north, Murray Hill to the west, and Lake Shore and Fairfax to the south. The boundary between Riverside and Avondale is not clear cut, even for those living in the neighborhood. It is sometimes given as Seminole Road and Belvedere Avenue, the northern limit of the Avondale Historic District.Duval County listings at National Register of Historic Places. Alternately, author Wayne Wood of the Jacksonville Historic Landmarks Commission puts it at about McDuff Avenue. History =Riverside= The H. D. Smith House in Riverside Riverside and Avondale were developed out of former plantation land. Most of this area was part of two plantations: Dell's Bluff, granted by the Spanish Florida government in 1801, and a tract eventually known as Magnolia Plantation, granted in 1815. Both changed hands several times before the American Civil War. In 1868, Dell's Bluff's then owner, Miles Price, sold off the southern part of the plantation to Florida Union editor Edward M. Cheney and Boston developer John Murray Forbes, who platted the original Riverside development. The northern part Price developed himself as Jacksonville's Brooklyn neighborhood. Riverside and Brooklyn saw modest growth until 1887, when the city of Jacksonville annexed them and established a streetcar line. Following the Great Fire of 1901, which destroyed most of Downtown Jacksonville, many displaced residents moved to Riverside. Wealthy citizens built mansions close to the river, while the less well-to-do purchased more modest bungalows and other homes further inland. The neighborhood grew steadily, with development continuing well beyond its original bounds to the south, until the collapse of the Florida land boom in the late 1920s. During this period, so many architects working in such a wide variety of contemporary styles experimented in Riverside that it has become the most architecturally diverse neighborhood in Florida. Largely due to Riverside's profusion of bungalow homes, Jacksonville has what is likely the largest number of such structures in the state. One notable section of Riverside is Silvertown, a subdivision developed in 1887 for African Americans. Initially isolated from largely white Riverside to the east, it was eventually absorbed into the growing neighborhood. As such, Silvertown residents became some of the few black homeowners in Riverside through the period of segregation. A few one-story wood-frame houses in the area may date to the original development, including one house owned by a woman and then her daughter from 1887 into the 1980s. =Avondale= 1487 Challen Avenue in Avondale Avondale was developed later as a new area of Riverside on former Magnolia Plantation land. In 1884 Northern developers planned and platted a community in this area called \\"Edgewood\\", however it did not take off and the land was largely undeveloped; hunters still pursued game there until the 1910s. In 1920 an investment group led by Telfair Stockton purchased Edgewood and surrounding land to develop as an exclusive upscale subdivision. Named for Cincinnati's Avondale neighborhood, home of former Edgewood owner James R. Challen, the development was billed as \\"Riverside's Residential Ideal\\", which was \\"...desirable because the right kind of people have recognized its worth and because the wrong kind of people can find property more to their liking elsewhere.\\" Avondale was a restricted, whites only development, and the most extensively planned community Jacksonville had ever seen. In contrast to the architectural diversity in the rest of Riverside, Avondale featured more uniform architecture predominantly in the Mediterranean Revival style. Following its success, several adjacent developments sprung up, which eventually became lumped together as part of Avondale. =Later history and preservation= The mid-20th century brought change to Riverside and Avondale, including the construction of Interstate 95 and the Fuller Warren Bridge, the establishment of St. Vincent's Medical Center, and the construction of office buildings along Riverside Avenue. Through this time, a number of Riverside and Avondale's historic buildings were demolished or allowed to decay. Neighborhood advocates fought this trend by forming a historic preservation organization, Riverside Avondale Preservation, in 1974, and lobbying for the creation of historic districts in the neighborhood. As a result, the Riverside Historic District, Jacksonville's first historic district, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; it now comprises 6870 acres and contains 2120 historic buildings. In 1989, the Avondale Historic District was added, and the following year the Jacksonville City Council established the Jacksonville Historic Preservation Commission in order to protect historic structures. Riverside Avondale Preservation has grown into one of the largest such organizations in the country. As a result of this focus on preservation and planning, the American Planning Association named Riverside and Avondale one of the country's top ten neighborhoods in 2010. Commercial districts Riverside and Avondale are chiefly residential, but they have some commercial zoning, including several commercial centers that are architecturally integrated with the rest of the neighborhood. =Five Points= Five Points Five Points is a small commercial district centered on the five-way intersection between Park, Lomax, and Margaret Streets. The area was originally residential, but transitioned to commercial uses after World War I and several retail buildings were constructed. The Park Arcade Building, an Italian Renaissance revival structure with storefronts marked by variant rooflines, set the architectural tone for the district when it was completed in 1928. Other notable features include Sun-Ray Cinema, formerly Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927 as the first movie theater in Florida equipped to show talking pictures. Over the last several decades, Five Points has become known for its edgy, bohemian character and many independent shops, restaurants and businesses. The area has also become a cultural center for Jacksonville's LGBTQ population, being home to various LGBTQ organizations, bars, clubs, and venues as well as the annual River City Pride parade which draws thousands to the district every October. =King Street District= Riverside Baptist Church in the King Street District The King Street District originated with Whiteway Corner, a group of commercial buildings at the intersection of King and Park Street built by the Nasrallah brothers beginning in 1927. The Nasrallahs' buildings included the novelty of electric exterior lights, hence the name \\"White Way\\". Other notable buildings at this corner are a 1942 Style Moderne structure built for Lane Drug Company by Marsh & Saxelbye, and the 1925 Riverside Baptist Church, designed by prominent architect Addison Mizner. Subsequently, commercial development and zoning spread along King Street and its cross streets. After several decades of decline, King Street has experienced a revival since 2005 following a successful streetscaping project. A popular beer bar that opened that year set the tone for later establishments, many of them craft beer oriented. Subsequently, the district has become the home of many bars, restaurants, stores, and night clubs, as well as an arts district and two craft breweries to the north. As a result of this growth, the King Street District emerged as Jacksonville's beer hub in the 2010s. =Shoppes of Avondale= The Shoppes of Avondale is an upscale shopping center comprising about 46 storefronts on St. Johns Avenue. Like Five Points, it dates to the 1920s, when Avondale was first developed. Its small-scale buildings were designed to blend with the residential neighborhood; the most notable is a 1927 edifice designed by Henry J. Klutho in partnership with Fred S. Cates and Albert N. Cole at 3556-3560 St. Johns Avenue. The center was renovated in 2010 under Jacksonville's Town Center Program, which allocated funds for revitalizing neighborhood commercial districts. Features City parks in Riverside and Avondale include Riverside Park and Memorial Park, which is situated on the river and features a statue of the \\"winged figure of youth\\" sculpted by C. Adrian Pillars. The Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens is located in Riverside; founded in 1961, it contains one of the world's three most comprehensive collections of Meissen porcelain, large collections of American, European and Japanese art, and two acres of Italian and English gardens listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The neighborhood is home to Robert E. Lee High School, one of the city's oldest schools still in use, and the Kent Campus of Florida State College at Jacksonville, the institution's oldest campus.

Usage The word \\"kgosi\\" is a Setswana term for \\"king\\" or \\"chief\\". Various affixes can be added to the word to change its meaning: adding the prefix di- creates the plural form dikgosi; the feminine suffix -gadi makes the word kgosigadi; and the adjectival suffix -kgolo, meaning \\"large\\", creates kgosikgolo, the word for \\"supreme leader\\". It is a title often given to tribal aristocrats in Botswana and surrounding countries where there are Tswana speaking people. The office of tribal leadership is called the bogosi while the person who assumes the office is the kgosi. Duties The Bogosi Act of 2008 defines the powers of dikgosi. According to the Bogosi Act, the kgosi of a tribe has several duties: to manage the tribe, to organize kgotla meetings, and to follow the rules and advice of the national government and the members of the tribe. The dikgosi of the eight main Batswana tribes automatically become members of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, an advisory body within the Parliament of Botswana. The kgosi has the ability to appoint a mothusa kgosi who acts as an acting leader while the kgosi is temporarily unable to perform his or her duties. This is different from the motshwarelela bogosi, an office created when the kgosi is permanently unable to perform his or her duties and a replacement kgosi is needed. The act has been criticised by tribal leaders because of the limitations on the powers of a kgosi. In 2010, Kgosi Kgafela II of the Kgatla tribe was accused of flogging, but he argued that dikgosi have immunity to the state's jurisdiction. The Botswana High Court dismissed the case on 11 May 2011, claiming that \\"dikgosi cannot act outside the constitution and laws prescribed by Parliament when all other functionaries of the state act within the statutory limitations.\\" To avoid the legal costs of the case, Kgafela moved to Moruleng, South Africa.

He explores the use of Oriental imagery in the appropriation of it within the West and the East and in both the past and the present. Elements found in Parnes' art include: ancient and modern history; mysticism; war; and fashion. He alters the context of the logos of corporate brands, such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Ferrari, Puma, Citibank, Subway, and Burger King. He does this to express a view of corporate influence and how its relationship with traditional cultures has developed.

The film was released in 2010 and directed by the Ford brothers. Plot Lieutenant Brian Murphy (Freeman), a United States Air Force engineer, is the sole survivor of the final evacuation plane out of Africa, which crashes somewhere off the coast of West Africa. The previous night, a zombie horde attacked many villages throughout that area. Brian gathers supplies from the plane crash and travels by foot until he finds and fixes a broken-down truck in a village he reaches. While driving, the truck gets stuck in a pothole as zombies close in. Daniel Dembele (Osei), a local African soldier gone AWOL in search of his son, rescues Brian from certain death. Daniel's wife had been killed in a zombie attack the previous night and a local military unit, heading north to a military base, had rescued his son. Daniel agrees to lead Brian to the nearest airport, a day's drive away, in exchange for his truck upon arrival for Daniel to use to find his son. At the airport, Brian attempts radioing for help using the air traffic tower's radio, but he receives no response. Daniel gathers fuel for the truck and the two agree it would be best to stick together and attempt travel to the military base, with Daniel hoping his son is there and Brian hoping they have a plane he can repair to fly back to the United States. They rest for a night at a village that has been converted to a survival colony safeguarded by a group of local soldiers. They leave the following morning. While driving through the African plains, the truck hits a tree, breaking the axle and disabling the vehicle. Brian and Daniel continue on foot and sleep around a fire that night. A zombie horde attacks the group in their sleep, leaving Daniel bitten and badly wounded. They manage to shoot their way out of the attack and continue moving forward. Daniel tells Brian of a necklace he wears and that he planned to pass down to his son. Daniel succumbs to his wounds soon thereafter. Brian continues the trek alone to the northern military base. After an arduous journey through dangerous and rough terrain, Brian reaches the base, which has become a survival colony. He repairs an old radio unit in the base and broadcasts his name, managing to reach fellow American military officer Frank Greaves at a U.S. military base in Henderson, Nevada. It is revealed that the epidemic has reached the United States, which is rapidly failing to hold out. When Brian asks about his family, Frank informs him that \\"they're gone.\\" Zombies invade the U.S. military base, ending the radio transmission. Brian goes back outside as zombies overwhelm the gates around the colony and begin killing all the survivors. At the last moment, Daniel's son approaches Brian, seeing his father's necklace in his hand, and they turn to face the overwhelming horde that approaches them. The film ends leaving their fate unknown. Cast Production The production encountered many problems, and rather than shooting in the planned six weeks, the crew actually ending up taking 12 weeks. A delay in the shipping of the equipment to Africa initially added three weeks to the schedule; other notable problems included the lead actor Rob Freeman contracting malaria and almost dying in the middle of filming. He was taken to the local hospital and put on an IV drip for several days. Another delay was caused by considerable damage to camera equipment. Shooting took place in Burkina Faso and Ghana. Post-production was done in Brighton, London and Elstree in the UK. The film sound mix was completed by Bafta nominated Adam and Graham Daniel shortly before Christmas 2010. Howard J. Ford published book, titled Surviving the Dead (2012), that detailed the troubled production history. Release The film had its world premiere in August 2010 at Frightfest and its U.S. premiere at Fantastic Fest. U.S. and UK rights were acquired by Anchor Bay Entertainment. After a UK theatrical the UK DVD and Blu-ray was released in September 2011. In the U.S., The Dead opened on over 150 screens. The U.S. DVD and Blu-ray commenced in February 2012. Other territories which picked up the film included France, Germany, Russia, Australia, Korea, Japan, Latin America, Scandinavia, and Benelux. Reception The reviews for the film were generally positive. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 72% approval rating with an average rating of 5.7/10 based on 18 reviews. Metacritic rated it 59/100 based on six reviews. Joe Leydon of Variety wrote, \\"With nary a trace of snark, satire or self-consciousness, Brit sibling filmmakers Howard J. and Jon Ford breathe some fresh life into zombie-thriller tropes.\\" Mark Adams of Screen Daily wrote, \\"And while the story offers nothing particularly new to the genre, The Dead is a film made with passion and enthusiasm and is certainly distinctive in tone and backdrop.\\" Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"This low-budget zombie movie rises out of the pack thanks to a smart and ambitious decision to shoot in Burkina Faso.\\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that the film has a possibly unintended, disturbing metaphorical subtext due to Africans killing each other. Of the road movie aspects, Genzlinger called it \\"a long, chemistry-free slog through the zombified countryside\\". The Los Angeles Times wrote that the setting initially helps the film's atmosphere but eventually overwhelms it with metaphors of violence in Africa. John DeFore of The Washington Post criticized casting, acting, and writing, though he said that the gore effects will satisfy horror fans. Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice called it \\"Night of the Living Dead reimagined as a Sergio Leone western\\". The Star Tribune rated it 2/4 stars and wrote that the film lacks enough social commentary and creepy scares to make up for its lack of fully using its setting. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that \\"the film provides a whole new way of looking at the same old dead things\\". Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine rated it 2/4 stars and called it \\"a perfectly serviceable horror movie\\" that \\"fails to transcend the banality of its inevitable theme\\". Matthew Lee of Twitch Film wrote, \\"Though the brothers generally treat their story with a fair degree of sensitivity, never patronising or exoticising anyone, other than the setting there's nothing that unique about it.\\" Mike Pereira of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and called it a \\"pretty routine\\" zombie film that will appeal to hardcore zombie fans. Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and called it one of the best recent zombie films. Sequel A sequel, The Dead 2: India, was released on 22 August 2013, and then on DVD on 16 September 2014. Unlike the first film, the setting takes place in India. The sequel follows the story of American engineer Nicholas Burton (Joseph Millson) in a race against time to reach his pregnant girlfriend Ishani Sharma (Meenu Mishra) during a virus outbreak. Burton enlists the help of an orphaned street kid Javed (Anand Krishna Goyal) together, they make a perilous 300-mile journey across deadly landscapes as a zombie apocalypse threatens to engulf the entire nation.

Donated by Joseph W. Drexel in 1888 to the Lenox Library (which later became The New York Public Library), the collection, located today at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, is rich with materials on music theory and music history as well as other musical subjects. It contains many rare books and includes a number of significant 17th-century English music manuscripts.Otto Kinkeldey, \\"The New York Public Library and Its Music Division,\\" Library Journal v. 4 (August 1915), p. 590.Susan T.

Sommer, \\"Drexel Collection,\\" Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, vol. 15 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 1973), columns 1846-1848. Bust of Joseph W. Drexel by John Quincy Adams Ward (1889), located at the 3rd floor entrance of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts  Origins  The musical library of Joseph W. Drexel had its origins in the library of Henry F. Albrecht (1822-1875). Born in Germany and trained as a musician, Albrecht's passion for collecting books on music had been fueled by Siegfried Dehn, musician and librarian of the Royal Library (today the Berlin State Library), whom he had met in Berlin.Nancy Newman, \\"Albrecht, Henry [Heinrich] F.,\\" Grove Music Online, accessed 16 July 2012. Albrecht emigrated to the United States in 1848 where he was one of the organizers of the Germania Musical Society, a touring orchestra in which he was the second clarinetist. Visiting many locations in the United States enabled Albrecht to collect music literature and scores. The Society disbanded in 1854, while in residence at Newport, Rhode Island. That year, Albrecht decided to join the Icarians in Nauvoo, Illinois, which required that members donate all their belongings.John Dwight, \\"The Germania Musical Society,\\" Dwight's Journal of Music (September 16, 1854), p. 189. Albrecht created an inventory of his collection of 661 volumes, intending to donate them to the Icarians. In writing about the demise of the Germania Musical Society and Albrecht's plans, John Sullivan Dwight remarked \\"His library of music and of musical books, for one collected by so young a man, is really quite a wonder.\\" Quoting from an unidentified article in the Newport Daily News, he added: \\"It is a well known fact that libraries of this kind are very rare\\" and that Albrecht's was \\"one of the most complete in America.\\" The Icarian community at Nauvoo failed by 1856 and its members dispersed. In 1858, Albrecht sold his library to Joseph W. Drexel and moved to Philadelphia. Drexel was a banker in the midst of a very profitable career as a partner in the firm Drexel, Morgan & Co. With Albrecht's assistance, Drexel kept adding to his library. In 1865, he purchased portions of the library of Dr. Rene La Roche (1795-1872) (also mentioned as a competing library in Dwight's article) which contained English, French, and Latin publications.Catalogue of an extensive and valuable medical and scientific library: being part of the collection of R. La Roche, M.D., of Philadelphia, which includes many very scarce works, in various languages, to be sold on Tuesday, October 24th, 1865. M. Thomas & Sons, Auctioneers. Philadelphia: M. Thomas & Sons, 1865. In 1869, Drexel published (with Albrecht's assistance) a catalog of the published works in his collection which at the time contained 2,245 volumes. Additional volumes inventorying musical autographs, musical scores, and iconography were planned but were never published. Sometimes Drexel's purchases made for social news. On November 17, 1876, the New York Herald Tribune announced that Drexel had purchased a manuscript missal of the fifteenth century written on vellum for $177.50.\\"The Menzies' Library Sale,\\" New York Herald-Tribune (November 17, 1876), p. 8. The most important later addition to Drexel's library was the purchase of a major portion of the library of Edward F. Rimbault which was auctioned in 1877.Catalogue of the valuable library of the late Edward Francis Rimbault, comprising an extensive and rare collection of ancient music, printed and in manuscript...which will be sold by auction, by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge ... on Tuesday, the 31st of July, 1877, and five following days. The significance of the library even merited a newspaper announcement.\\"Dr. Rimbault,\\" New York Herald-Tribune (August 30, 1877), p. 4. Rimbault's valuable collection was well-known, and it was with dismay that The Musical Times reported: \\"all [the English unica] should have been purchased for the British Museum: now unfortunately it is too late, as a large proportion are on their way to New York.\\"A. Hyatt King, Catalog of the Music Library of Edward Francis Rimbault Sold at London 31 July-7 August 1877, with the Library of Dr. Rainbeau, reprint (Buren: Frits Knuf, 1975), p. viii. (Purchases for Drexel at the Rimbault auction were made by the London firm of Joseph Sabin & Sons.) In 1877, Drexel also instructed Sabin to purchase at least two volumes from the estate of musicologist Edmond de Coussemaker (Aristoxenos's Auctores musices antiquissimi (1616) and Vincenzo Galilei‚Äôs Dialogo (1581), as well as volumes from the estate of Henry Aim√© Ouvry and several other minor figures. After this year his acquisitions appeared nearly to stop, except for purchases of rare books in 1880 from Ludwig Rosenthal‚Äôs Catalogue XXVI (purchased through the New York dealer F. W. Christern). Though Drexel was an active concert and opera attendee in the years of his retirement, very few contemporary musical works are present in his collection.  Death and donation to Lenox Library  An active philanthropist and a board member of several institutions after his retirement in 1877, Drexel made known his intention was that his library be donated to the Lenox Library upon his death.\\"The Right Use of Riches,\\" Wisconsin State Journal (March 30, 1888), p. 4. He died during the Great Blizzard of 1888. It was with surprise that newspapers noted that his will contained only a single bequest to a charitable organization: > All that portion of my library which consists of works relating to the > science of music, also all musical compositions and treatises on other works > on musical subjects\\" [be given to the Lenox Library] \\"upon the express > condition that the said trustees of The Lenox Library shall sign and deliver > to my executors, hereinafter named, a written acceptance of the said portion > of my library, and an agreement to keep the same separated from all other > books or collections of books, and to preserve the same in separate shelves > or cases, to be labeled \\"Drexel Musical Library.\\"\\"Joseph W. Drexel's Will. > Only One Public Bequest, to the Lenox Library, of New York,\\" Philadelphia > Inquirer (April 2, 1888), p. 3. \\"The collection of musical works in his library is considered one of the finest in the United States...\\" reported the New York Herald in its obituary of Drexel.\\"Joseph W. Drexel,\\" New York Herald (March 26, 1888), p. 5. The trustees of the Lenox Library voted on June 7, 1888 to accept the bequest. When the Lenox Library merged with the Astor Library and the Tilden Trust in 1895 to form The New York Public Library, the Drexel Collection was organized by subject based on the classification system of John Shaw Billings, the first director of the newly formed library. As stipulated by Drexel's will, his collection was given call numbers distinct from the rest of the library in the form of consecutive numbering, 1 through 6013 (some volumes contained many pamphlets or smaller works bound together). Although it has moved several times since its inception, the Music Division continues to house the Drexel Collection under special conditions for reasons of preservation.  Contents  Albrecht's interests were German music theory and history, as well as contemporaneous German and American publications. Once in the hands of Drexel, he sought to enhance publications in French. Sixteenth century music theory is well represented. Very little 16th century music is present, though the collection contains Baltazar de Beaujoyeulx 'Ballet de la Reine\\" from 1582, work known as a forerunner of opera. Thanks to the purchases from the Rimbault sale, the Drexel Collection has a number of unique sources (many of them manuscripts) of early seventeenth-century English music: *Drexel 3976 - \\"The rare theatrical, & other compositions\\" - a compilation of music by Matthew Locke *Drexel 4041 - a collection of English songs compiled before 1649, probably copied for Lord Ferrers. *Drexel 4175 - known as Ann Twice, Her Booke *Drexel 4180‚Äî4185 - a collection of six part books *Drexel 4257 - known as John Gamble's Commonplace Book *Drexel 4302 - known as Francis Sambrooke, His Booke *Drexel 5061 - Ayres for viols - containing sources for works by Henry Purcell and others *Drexel 5120 - Parthenia Inviolata, the only known copy of the second volume of keyboard music published in England *Drexel 5609 - an eighteenth-century collection of English dance music *Drexel 5611 - English keyboard music of the seventeenth century *Drexel 5612 - a collection of dance music from seventeenth-century England *Drexel 5856 - a collection of music copied by John Christopher Smith, one of Handel's copyists *Drexel 5871 - the manuscript of 27 works for viola da gamba by Carl Friedrich Abel  Publications  The following list contains selected publications that have depended on unique materials from the Drexel Collection. *Abel, Karl Friedrich. 27 Pieces for the Viola da Gamba: New York Public Library Ms. Drexel 5871.

The Beaver River Bridge is an example of a mid-20th century cantilever deck truss with preservation groups making efforts to save it from demolition as its structural style is becoming rare. About 20,000 vehicles travel across the bridge each day.  Replacement  In 2012, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission set aside nearly $300 million to replace the bridge, and began the design phase of its Milepost 12-14 reconstruction project. The project involves widening of the existing turnpike between the two mileposts to support a total of six 12' wide lanes, two 12' wide shoulders, as well as a 26' wide median. To support a wider road, three overhead structures along the turnpike were replaced between 2015 and 2016, and the ramp bridge over Route 18 at the nearby Beaver Valley Interchange was replaced with a temporary bridge. The interchange itself will also be completely reconfigured and the turnpike's mainline bridge over Route 18 will be replaced. Construction is expected to resume in 2019 to widen the turnpike, replace the bridge, and reconfigure the Beaver Valley Interchange.

It documents the rise and fall of his company, the online social network Muxlim. The author is David J. Cord, an American expatriate living in Finland. Summary Mohamed 2.0 chronicles the life of Mohamed El-Fatatry, an Egyptian national who grew up in the United Arab Emirates. While young, El- Fatatry became intensely interested in the Internet, and taught college-level courses on web development even before he graduated from high school. After deciding move to Finland to study technology, he created Muxlim there in 2006. It was intended as a social network for Muslims that was to be open and liberal, and to serve as a bridge between religions and cultures. However, both he and the site struggled against some of the more conservative elements of the religious community. Muxlim became quite popular, particularly with Muslims resident in America and Western Europe, and the site received extensive media coverage. El-Fatatry‚Äôs ideas of using the website as a meeting place of different nationalities and religions led him to be invited to speak to both the United Nations and American White House staff. Despite the widespread attention, the company continually struggled with finances. The book describes the attempts by El-Fatatry to simultaneously secure funding, increase sales, and develop the related websites. When the social network did not develop as the company had hoped, it transitioned first into a Muslim- related content aggregator and then into a business consultant. With meager sales and no more incoming venture capital and investment, Muxlim was shut down early in 2012. The book also details El-Fatatry‚Äôs philosophy and his future plans for developing technology-related businesses. Development The book was originally intended to be an autobiography, but El-Fatatry recommended the publisher contact Cord. The project then turned into a biography. Reception The book generated controversy even before it was released. Esa M√§kinen of Helsingin Sanomat received an advance copy and wrote a critical article about the poor financial performance of Muxlim. M√§kinen detailed the heavy financial losses the company sustained, the public funding it received, and the small size of the online traffic generated by the site. The article also erroneously reported that El-Fatatry contributed ‚Ç¨46,000 to Finnish Presidential hopeful Eva Biaudet‚Äôs campaign, an accusation that received heavy press coverage in Finland (the article has since been corrected). In response to some of the business-related criticism, ArcticStartup, the largest website reporting on technology startups in the Nordic region, defended growth entrepreneurship in an editorial and published a rebuttal from El-Fatatry. Critic Tommi Aitio of the business newspaper Kauppalehti praised Mohamed 2.0, saying it was \\"quality entertainment, drama that even Hollywood would never have come up with. Muxlim‚Äôs story might have been a glorious failure, but David J. Cord‚Äôs book is, even in its idealising, simply brilliant\\". Janne Wass of Nytid was more critical, suggesting it should not be called a \\"biography\\" since he learned very little about El-Fatatry from the book, and noted that his portrayal was \\"slightly sanitised\\". Wass also complained that El-Fatatry‚Äôs views on technology contained nothing new or revolutionary.

It has a coarsely granular surface and large eyes that are very close together. Distribution L. baudiniana has been found from Bermuda to the Yucat√°n Peninsula and south to Panama. Behavior They venture out in great numbers in the intertidal zone at low tide, then they retreat as the water returns, but they need the water to keep their gills warm and have never found more than from shore. They cannot live in seawater for extended periods, as can L. oceanica, for example. They survive best in moist environments, but cannot survive in fresh water, most likely due losing their vital salts via dilution. To hydrate, they turn away from the water and dip their uropods in the water and oscillate the distance between the uropodal spines to draw water up onto their gills. When it rains, they come out en masse several feet from the shore. L. baudiniana feeds primarily on the unicellular green algae that coat intertidal rocks, rasping them off with a vertical movement of the front half of its body. L. baudiniana changes coloring, lighter or darker, based on its background.

Flourishing approximately from AD 100 to 600, the culture's sites are common near the modern city of Vincennes, Indiana.Muller, Jon. Archaeology of the Lower Ohio River Valley. Walnut Creek: Left Coast, 2009. First defined in 1963,Maruszak, Kathleen, and Debi A. Jones. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Stoner Site. National Park Service, 1978-08. the culture was originally described as being divided into two phases ‚Äî Allison and LaMotte ‚Äî although some later authors have taught a single unified phase. Characteristics Allison-Lamotte sites are commonly located along the Wabash or its tributaries; they generally occupy land that was in prairie before white settlement of the region, and many are found near marshes. It was a moundbuilding culture, although unlike many other moundbuilding cultures of the period, its mounds were often not used for mortuary purposes. Many Allison-Lamotte villages featured a circular plan with a central plaza surrounded by circular houses. Judging by phenomena such as house sizes, it is believed that the society lacked a substantial class structure. Members of the culture hunted heavily, commonly preying on animals such as deer, turkeys, turtles, and shellfish; among their leading plant foods were hickory nuts and domesticated squash. The culture's pottery and lithic technology were typical of Late Woodland peoples; earlier generations of the culture seemingly produced cord-marked pottery and later generations are thought to have favored a process of stamping their pottery to produce rough edges, while Allison- Lamotte projectile points are of a form substantially identical to points found at nearby sites of other cultures, such as the Mann Site. Similarities between Allison-Lamotte and contemporary surrounding cultures are so great that after more than fifteen years of active research, no clear boundaries could be drawn between it and its neighbors. Cultural center and relationships One of the culture's most important sites is the Stoner Site, located in southeastern Illinois. Discovered in 1930, Stoner was intensively occupied by Allison-Lamotte peoples and lacks any evidence of substantial occupation by other peoples. Evidence from this and other sites appears to suggest that members of the culture highly valued lamellar flint knives. Robert Barth has proposed that the members of the culture eventually developed into the Vincennes phase of the Mississippian culture, which was contemporary with and would have maintained substantial relationships with inhabitants of the Angel Site of far southwestern Indiana and the Kincaid Site of far southern Illinois.

During the minority of his nephew Alfonso XI, he shared the regency of Castile with his mother and uncle, John el de Tarifa, between 1313 and his death.

Although she was betrothed to King Peter I of Portugal, the marriage never took place. In 1313, reached at divided the regency of the young Alfonso XI between Peter, John and Mar√≠a, with the men being described as tutores. This was confirmed by a cortes at Burgos in 1315. Throughout the disputes over the regency in the years 1312‚Äì15 that often devolved into open conflict, Peter supported his mother and was often at odds with his uncle. In 1316, Peter led a military expedition to the frontier of the Kingdom of Granada. According to Christian sources, he won a great victory in the field, but unsuccessfully besieged two castles. Muslims sources mention no victory. In 1317, he again invaded Granada, relieving the siege of Gibraltar and capturing the castle of B√©lmez de la Moraleda. In 1319, having received papal approval for a crusade against Granada, Peter and John jointly led an expedition to besiege the fortress of T√≠scar. They separated their armies and were ambushed by a Muslim relief force. Both Peter and John were killed in the ensuing rout, known as the Disaster of the Vega de Granada.

Jones worked in 889 major league games during that stretch. Umpiring career From 1936 to 1943, Jones was a minor league umpire with the South Atlantic League, Piedmont League and Southern Association. In 1942, Jones had an opportunity to get a pay raise by moving the American Association, but he turned it down, saying that he liked it when fans heckled him with a southern accent. He made his major league debut as third base umpire in a twelve-inning game between Philadelphia and Washington on April 18, 1944. In a 1946 game at Fenway Park, Jones was behind the plate when he received heckling from the Chicago White Sox bench. Jones was called a \\"meathead\\" and someone made \\"whoopee-cushion noises\\". Unable to pinpoint the culprits, Jones ejected fourteen from the Chicago bench. For many years, legend had it that the razzing came from a ventriloquist in the stands, but at least one player has identified Chicago coach Mule Haas as the source. Jones umpired his last MLB game in 1949. Umpire Bill McKinley described him as a good umpire but one who was easily distracted by comments from players and fans. \\"He heard everything,\\" McKinley said. \\"It took his concentration off the game. It bothered him so much that they finally had to fire him after six years.\\" Later life In 1950, Jones left umpiring and took a post in sales with the Pfeiffer Brewing Company in Detroit. He later worked in public relations for the Associated Brewing Company and briefly as a television commentator for the Cleveland Indians.

They can control electromagnetic radiation by applying the rules of quantum mechanics. In the broad sense, a quantum metamaterial is a metamaterial in which certain quantum properties of the medium must be taken into account and whose behaviour is thus described by both Maxwell's equations and the Schr√∂dinger equation. Its behaviour reflects the existence of both EM waves and matter waves. The constituents can be at nanoscopic or microscopic scales, depending on the frequency range (e.g., optical or microwave). Note: the DOI is linked to a full text article. Note: full text article available \\\\- click on title. In a more strict approach, a quantum metamaterial should demonstrate coherent quantum dynamics. Such a system is essentially a spatially extended controllable quantum object that allows additional ways of controlling the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Quantum metamaterials can be narrowly defined as optical media that: * Are composed of quantum coherent unit elements with engineered parameters; * Exhibit controllable quantum states of these elements; * Maintain quantum coherence for longer than the traversal time of a relevant electromagnetic signal. Research Fundamental research in quantum metamaterials creates opportunities for novel investigations in quantum phase transition, new perspectives on adiabatic quantum computation and a route to other quantum technology applications. Such a system is essentially a spatially-extended controllable quantum object that allows additional ways of controlling electromagnetic wave propagation. In other words, quantum metamaterials incorporate quantum coherent states in order to control and manipulate electromagnetic radiation. With these materials, quantum information processing is combined with the science of metamaterials (periodic artificial electromagnetic materials). The unit cells can be imagined to function as qubits that maintain quantum coherence \\"long enough for the electromagnetic pulse to travel across\\". The quantum state is achieved through the material's individual cells. As each cell interacts with the propagating electromagnetic pulse, the whole system retains quantum coherence. Several types of metamaterials are being studied. Nanowires can use quantum dots as the unit cells or artificial atoms of the structure, arranged as periodic nanostructures. This material demonstrates a negative index of refraction and effective magnetism and is simple to build. The radiated wavelength of interest is much larger than the constituent diameter. Another type uses periodically arranged cold atom cells, accomplished with ultra-cold gasses. A photonic bandgap can be demonstrated with this structure, along with tunability and control as a quantum system. Quantum metamaterial prototypes based on superconducting devices with and without Josephson junctions are being actively investigated. Recently a superconducting quantum metamaterial prototype based on flux qubits was realized.

The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. The battle began when Mexican insurgents numbering around 5,600 men under the command of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n, Mariano Matamoros y Guridi, Nicol√°s Bravo, and Hermenegildo Galeana attacked the city of Valladolid at midday on 23 December after the Spanish refused their demands to surrender the city. The Mexican insurgents, who numbered around 5,600 men, were commanded by Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n and the Spanish by Agust√≠n Cosme Dami√°n de Iturbide y Ar√°mburu who would later go on to become the Mexican emperor. The battle which lasted the better part of two days, resulted in a victory for the Spanish royalists. The tide of the battle turned when reinforcements arrived from Mexico City sent by the Viceroy of New Spain, F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja under the command of Ciriaco del Llano. Around midnight, the royalist forces succeeded in penetrating the insurgent camp, obliging them to flee the battle in disorder. This battle was significant in that it marked the decline of Morelos' military campaign for independence. Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, the insurgent leader.  Context  Mariano Matamoros, who commanded the third assault on Valladolid on 23 December. After the declaration of Mexican independence triggered war with the Spanish royalists, the priest of Car√°cuaro, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n met with rebel leader Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla on 20 October 1810 at Charo, Michoac√°n de Ocampo where he was commissioned to fight against the Spanish colonial government in the southern area of the viceroyalty with the established goal of capturing Acapulco de Ju√°rez. After the execution of Hidalgo on 30 July 1811, Morelos became the de facto leader of the insurrection. After the rebel forces failed to capture Acapulco at the Battle of El Veladero, they fortified themselves in Cuautla where they successfully defeated F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja at the Siege of Cuautla. From there the rebels marched to Tehuac√°n, and later to Oaxaca de Ju√°rez to take the city, something they succeeded in doing on 25 November 1812. In September 1813, the rebels convened the Congress of Chilpancingo, where news reached them of their successful capture of Acapulco. It was there decided that they should attempt to capture the city of Valladolid (present day Morelia) so that the congress could install itself in that city. In November, the rebel army traveled to the provincial capital of Michoac√°n de Ocampo, arriving in December. The battle F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja quickly uncovered the rebel plans to take the city of Valladolid through his extensive spy network inside Morelos' camp, also learning where Morelos was moving his forces and which forces were more concentrated than others. On 8 December, by order of the viceroy, Colonel Domingo Land√°zuri left Mexico City at the head of 1,000 soldiers. The Colonel Agust√≠n de Iturbide joined him at Puebla with the general Ciriaco del Llano, incorporating Land√°zuri's forces into their own on 23 December at Indaparapeo. Land√°zuri marched with one third of the troops directly to the city of Valladolid where he began preparations to resist a siege. Ram√≥n L√≥pez Ray√≥n informed Morelos of the Spanish royalist troop movements who then ordered Ray√≥n to attack the combined forces of Iturbide and Llano to gain time for his own troops to reach and capture Valladolid. Morelos further understood the need for expediency as he needed to capture the city before the arrival of further reinforcements sent from Mexico City. Ray√≥n and gathered his forces in pursuit of Llano. Various skirmishes took place on 21 December at Jer√©cuaro where the rebels were repulsed by Iturbide. After the royalists defeated Ray√≥n, they proceeded to chase his army through the campo de Santiaguito where Rafael L√≥pez Ray√≥n, the only son of the insurgent commander was killed in action. On the morning of 23 December, Morelos wrote Land√°zuri asking him to surrender the city of Valladolid, promising to respect the lives of the commander and the royalist defenders.Card Written by Morelos to Land√°zuri, 23 December 1813, Colecci√≥n de documentos hist√≥ricos de J.E. Hern√°ndez D√°valos, tomo IV, p√°gina 67) Land√°zuri ignored Morelos' offer and awaited the arrival of the attack. At midday, an insurgent division under the command of Hermenegildo Galeana began its assault on Valladolid. With just over 1,000 soldiers, Galeana entered the city from the north and routed the battalions placed there by Land√°zuri who for a time appeared to have been surrounded. About two hours later, the reinforcements under Iturbide and Llano arrived at the city who immediately clashed with the attacking forces under Galeana. Galeana decided to retire from the battle after he assessed his situation as hopeless in taking the city. Ciriaco del Llano had initially wanted to pursue the retreating Galeana, but was ordered not to do so by Iturbide who cited a tactical blunder which would be made in pursuit of the retreating forces. Galeana entered Morelos' camp and asked for reinforcements. Nicol√°s Bravo decided to attempt to attack the city again with his own division but was stopped by Llano and his troops at the center of the city, repulsing Bravo. Mariano Matamoros commanded the third and final attempt to take the city which failed similarly to the previous two attempts. After being informed of Matamoros' defeat by the Spanish Royalists, Morelos sent an emissary to Matamoros ordering him to return to camp so that they could again attempt to take the city the following day. The rebels camped in a heavily forested area on the outskirts of the Valladolid plains known as the Lomas de Santa Mar√≠a. Around midnight, the morning of 24 December, Iturbide had discovered the location of the rebel camp and was convinced by Llano to attack with expediency less the rebels be able to attack the city again the following day. Around 2 am,Time used in this article refers to Hora Central de M√©xico (UTC‚àí6). Llano and Iturbide attacked the rebel camp, killing about one fourth of the troops under Morelos' command. Due to the confusion and darkness, the rebel soldiers continued to fire at each other after royalist troops had already withdrawn. They fled the field in panic. This defeat marked the end of the fourth campaign initiated by Morelos and initiated the fifth where this southern noble would eventually meet his downfall and be executed by firing squad in 1815.  Aftermath  Execution of Matamoros. Due to concessions granted by members of the Supremo Poder Legislativo, installed by the Congress of Chilpancingo, Morelos decided to retreat with his forces from Valladolid and abandon all attempts to capture the city. He withdrew to Puebla and made plans to continue the fight at Puruar√°n. On 4 January 1814, Matamoros commanded a force of insurgents at the Battle of Puruar√°n against an army commanded by Iturbide alone as Llano had been by that time recalled to Spain and named the military commander of M√°laga, Andaluc√≠a. Matamoros' forces were utterly defeated at Puruar√°n and Matamoros himself was captured by a loyalist cadet named Leoncio Rodr√≠guez. He was taken prisoner by the Spanish forces and sentences to death on 23 January. Morelos attempted to save his life by offering the exchange of 200 Spanish royalist captured soldiers for Matamoros. The viceroy refused this offer and Matamoros was executed at the Portal del Ecce Homo on 3 February 1814. Upon discovering Matamoros' execution, Morelos ordered the massacre of all 200 Spanish prisoners. Morelos would meet his own death by execution at Spanish hands a year later in 1815.

The company name referred to the address of its original premises in Corsica Street, Highbury (Islington, North London). After a few years the business relocated further out of town to an alleyway off The Broadway, Cricklewood (Northwest London). Throughout its existence Corsica Coachworks remained small, never employing more than 20 people. Products Most Corsica bodies were fitted to the more sporting types of car, with bodies produced for Daimler, Bentley, Bugatti, Alfa Romeo, British Salmson, Frazer Nash, Humber, Lea-Francis, Rolls-Royce and Wolseley models. At least 14 Bugatti Type 57s were furnished with Corsica bodies. Just as the business was closed at the beginning of the war the company completed a Rolls-Royce limousine for Princess Marie Louise \\"and there may have been a few others like it\\". Design Every body would have been unique but a few dealers required short runs of a particular shape. If the owner's ideas on a body shape were too unformed, a contract draughtsman would be called in. The foreman body maker, Bert Skinner, would draw the entire body on plywood hanging on the wall including full-scale sideviews. After the body's frame had been built, the sheet aluminium or Dural would be shaped around it. Wings (mudguards) would be first outlined freehand in wire, then metal shaped to fit.

Weathering rind of a large granite glacial erratic eroding out of unconsolidated Permian till, Selwyn Rock, Inman Valley, South Australia A weathering rind is a discolored, chemically altered, outer zone or layer of a discrete rock fragment formed by the processes of weathering. The inner boundary of a weathering rind approximately parallels the outer surface of the rock fragment in which it has developed. Rock fragments with weathering rinds normally are discrete clasts, ranging in size from pebbles to cobbles or boulders. They typically occur either lying on the surface of the ground or buried within sediments such as alluvium, colluvium, or glacial till. A weathering rind represents the alteration of the outer portion of a rock by exposure to air or near surface groundwater over a period of time. Typically, a weathering rind may be enriched with either iron or manganese (or both), and silica, and oxidized to a yellowish red to reddish color. Often a weathering rind exhibits multiple bands of differing colors.Colman, SM, and KL Pierce (2001) Weathering rinds on andesitic and basaltic stones as a Quaternary age indicator, Western United States.

Although sometimes confused with weathering rinds, spheroidal weathering is a different type of chemical weathering in which spherical layers of weathered material progressively develop in situ around blocks of jointed bedrock beneath the Earth's surface, rather than in reworked and transported clasts such as cobbles and boulders.Fairbridge, RW (1968) Spheroidal Weathering. in RW Fairbridge, ed., pp. 1041-1044, The Encyclopedia of Geomorphology, Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences, vol. III. Reinhold Book Corporation, New York, New York.Ollier, CD (1971). Causes of spheroidal weathering. Earth-Science Reviews 7:127-141. Dating using weathering rinds Weathering rinds have a long history of being used to determine the relative age of either Quaternary sediments or landforms. This is done by comparing the thickness of weathering rinds of gravel composed of similar rock types. Deposits containing gravel with thicker weathering rinds are interpreted to be older than deposits containing rocks with thinner weathering rinds. Sedimentary deposits containing gravel with weathering rinds of the same thickness are interpreted to be approximately contemporaneous in age. The use of weathering rinds in relative dating is widely used in Arctic, Antarctic, and alpine regions and in the correlation of glacial moraines and tills and fluvial sediments and terraces.Goudie, AS, 2004, Rind, Weathering. in AS Goudie, ed., pp. 853-855, Encyclopedia of Geomorphology, vol. 2 J-Z Routledge, London-New York.

Arctic and Alpine Research. 13(1):25-31. In addition, weathering rinds have been used to determine the absolute amount of time gravel-size rock has been exposed to the weathering processes. This technique was proposed by Cernohouz and SolcCernohouz, J, and I Solc (1966) Use of sandstone wanes and weathered basaltic crust in absolute chronology. Nature 212:806‚Äì807. who first argued that the relationship between the thickness of a weathering-rind thickness and the time it took to form is expressed by a logarithmic function. This is done by determining the absolute age of sedimentary deposits containing either gravel-size rocks or artifacts using absolute dating methods such as C14 and measuring the weathering-rind thickness of rocks of similar lithology. The dates obtained from absolute dating techniques and measurements of weathering rind thicknesses are then used to construct an age versus thickness curve for dating rocks in other sedimentary deposits. This dating method has often been applied to glacial deposits in alpine regions.Chinn, T (1981) Use of rock weathering-rind thickness for Holocene absolute age-dating in New Zealand.

Geological Society of America Bulletin. 100(1):1224‚Äì1,236. =Obsidian hydration= Obsidian hydration dating is a type of dating that uses the weathering rind that develops within artifacts or gravel that are composed of obsidian. When fresh obsidian is exposed to air it typically contains less than 1% water. Over time, a weathering rind, known as an obsidian hydration band and composed of hydrated glass forms, as water slowly diffuses from a broken surface, which is normally associated with manufacture of an artifact, into the obsidian. The thickness of this band can be seen, and measured, using various techniques such as a high-power microscope with 40-80 power magnification, depth profiling with SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry), and IR-PAS (infra red photoacoustic spectroscopy).Walker, M (2005) Quaternary Dating Methods. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, England Stevenson, C, I. Liritzis, and M. Diakostamation (2002) Investigations towards the hydration dating of Œëegean obsidian. Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry. 2(1):93‚Äì109.Stevenson, C, and SW Novak (2011) Obsidian hydration dating by infrared spectroscopy: method and calibration. Journal of Archaeological Science. 3 (7):1716-1726. The determination of absolute age from the thickness of an obsidian hydration band is complicated and problematic. First, the rate at which the hydration of glass occurs varies significantly with temperature. The rate at which the obsidian hydration band forms increases with temperature. Second, the rate of hydration and obsidian hydration band formation varies with the geochemistry of the obsidian, including the intrinsic water content, seems to affect the rate of hydration. Finally, water vapor pressure may also affect the rate of obsidian hydration. If the rate of obsidian hydration band can be controlled for the obsidian's geochemistry (e.g., the \\"source\\"), temperature (usually approximated using an \\"effective hydration temperature\\" or EHT coefficient) and other factors, it might be possible to date an artifact using the obsidian hydration technique.Anovitz, LM, M Elam, L. Riciputi, and D Cole (1999) The failure of obsidian hydration dating: sources, implications, and new directions. Journal of Archaeological Science. 26(7):735‚Äì752. The presence or absence of an obsidian hydration band has been used to distinguish prehistoric obsidian debitage from obsidian debitage produced by modern flintknappers. This distinction can be made because it takes about 70 years for a band to enlarge sufficiently so that it is readily detectable on a freshly flaked surface of a piece of obsidian. For example, the basis of the lack of development of obsidian hydration bands, it was concluded that modern flintknappers brought specimens of obsidian to the Poverty Point Site in Louisiana.Boulanger, MT, MD Glascock, MS Shackley, C Skinner, and JJ Thatcher (2014) Likely Source Attribution for a Possible Paleoindian Obsidian Tool from Northwest Louisiana.

Available at the Mus√©e Vert, Le Mans (France) Representation of a pneumatic caisson, devised by Triger, dated 1846. Jacques Triger (10 March 1801 ‚Äì 16 December 1867)sometimes mistakenly quoted as Jules Triger, who is his brother; Birth Certificate from the city of Mamers, Sarthe, France, 10 March 1801 was a French geologist who invented the 'Triger process' for digging through waterlogged ground using a pressurised caisson. Triger was also Deputy Director of coal mining operations in Chalonnes-sur-Loire (Maine- et-Loire).  BiographyNotice sur la vie et les travaux de M. Triger, Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France, Tome 25 des bulletins, 1868  Triger was born in Mamers, a town in the Sarthe French county, on 10 March 1801. He studied at La Fl√®che and then in Paris, where he met Louis Cordier in 1825. Cordier was an eminent French geologist, who taught Triger his first lessons in geology. He was quickly interested in the technical challenges of this industrial sector. At 32 years old, together with skilled managers, he developed new industries in Sarthe and Mayenne. In this period he developed and launched three coal mines, a paper mill and a sawmill. In 1833 he was left by the woman he intended to marry. This disappointment in his personal life plunged him deeply into work: production of gravel from dolomite rock, construction of public fountains in Mamers and detailed study of phreatic groundwater tables near Le Mans. About 1834 he started the study and geological investigation of his region - Sarthe and Mayenne, and never stopped working on them until his death. These investigations, and discussions with Louis Cordier, drove him to Anjou (Maine-et-Loire) where coal was craft mined. Thus, in 1839, Triger seriously began to look at the Loire river and the way to reach solid rock underneath about 20 meters of waterlogged soil. After reading many articles on compressed air, he was convinced that he could use it to help dig through this layer of soil. His success does not lie on the idea of using compressed air, but in the invention of the airlock - to pass from the pressurised zone of the caisson to the zone of atmospheric air pressure, and especially in finding of a practical way to utilize the technique on an industrial scale. With the financial and administrative support of Emmanuel de Las Cases, 5 steel shaft linings were drilled by this invention, which was subsequently adapted and applied to dig foundations, bridges and many tunnels. While focused on his industrial activities, he did not step away from his geological research work. Helped by a liking for travel, he gradually established the first geological map of the Sarthe county. After more than 20 years of research, the document was presented in 1853 at the Geological Society of France. The topographic background, support of the geological layers, was designed by Triger himself. To design this document, he had to study all the fossils in his county and deal with some of the mysteries at that time - such as the structure of the Cretaceous terrain of Maine, or the study of the Silurian-Devonian- Carboniferous lands in the West part of France. Triger wanted the designation of the geological strata to be borrowed from paleontology (fossils names). He saw in this new system \\"the precious advantage of a universal language that one would understand everywhere, without comments and which would easily help the geologists from all regions of the globe to communicate\\". He was also a paleontologist, part of the first team to excavate the archaeological site of Roc-en Paille (Chalonnes-sur-Loire, Maine-et-Loire). His very large collection of rocks, fossils and minerals is now displayed at the Museum of Natural History in Angers. A last honorable task kept Triger busy until the end of his life: the constitution of regular geological cross-sections of the whole eastern part of France. This huge work was carried out by a team of geologists directed by Triger: geological sections from Paris to Brest, from Le Mans to Angers, from Paris to Rennes, Vend√¥me to Brest... On 16 December 1867 Triger died from a heart attack after a meeting at the Geological Society of France, where he served for 35 years. Triger's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.  Details of the Triger process  The work is done inside a chamber (known as a caisson) open at the bottom and in which compressed air is pumped to keep water out. Originally developed for use in a coal mine (Mines de Chalonnes-sur-Loire, 1839), it was later applied to bridge construction and civil applications as well. The process was used for the Brooklyn Bridge (1870) in the United States and the Forth Bridge in Scotland among others. The health hazards encountered working in a hyperbaric environment were gradually understood during these projects. The process was also used by Gustave Eiffel for the foundations of two of the four pillars supporting the Eiffel tower and by Attilio Muggia in Italy for the piers of the Caprigliola ‚Äì Albiano Magra bridge built in 1908 with reinforced concrete. Nowadays the method is still used in tunneling and shaft sinking operations. Modern Tunnel Boring Machines use compressed air to excavate soils below water tables.

The tunnel was constructed between 1830‚Äì1832; it was one of the first road tunnels built in Britain, and is the only pre-railway road tunnel in the country still in use. It was built to take a toll road underneath a steep hill to the north of Beaminster and make it easier for horse-drawn traffic to travel from the coast to the hinterland of Dorset. It underwent significant repairs in 1968 and again in 2009, but in 2012 a torrential rainstorm caused a landslide that resulted in the partial collapse of the tunnel's north entrance and the deaths of two people. Construction The tunnel is constructed from brick with walls thick, faced with Hamstone. It runs for under Horn Hill, a promontory to the north of Beaminster. The hill presented a major barrier to travellers passing from the newly enlarged harbour at West Bay on the Dorset coast to the hinterland; according to a contemporary writer, the hill was \\"a great impediment to the communication between the lower portion of Dorsetshire and a considerable district of Somerset, particularly with regard to Bridport harbour.\\" The main road passed over the hill, climbing almost 500 feet in a mile-and-a-half (150 metres in two kilometres). The steep gradient of 1-in-6 (17%) made passage difficult for horse-drawn transport. In the late 1820s, a Beaminster solicitor named Giles Russell proposed that the owners of the toll road over the hill, the Bridport 2nd District Turnpike Trust, should seek to build a tunnel under it to shorten and flatten the road. Russell played a key role in getting the project underway and managed to raise the ¬£13,000 required through loans and contributions from many of Beaminster's artisans and traders. In March 1830 Parliament passed the Bridport Turnpike Trust (Second District) Act, 1830 authorising construction of the tunnel, which began the following month. The engineer Michael Lane, a colleague of Marc Brunel who had worked on the pioneering Thames Tunnel in London, was in charge of the project, which took just over two years to complete. Only one fatality was sustained, a worker named William Aplin who died only three days before the tunnel opened when he was struck by a landslide outside one of the tunnel entrances. He was memorialised with a stone marked with a white cross which can still be seen in situ. The tunnel reduced the road's gradient from 1-in-6 (17%) to 1-in-10 (10%) and shortened it by a mile (1.6 km), as well as lowering its maximum elevation by . At the time of its opening, only a handful of road tunnels had been built in Britain; it pre-dates the construction of the first railway tunnels, and it is now the only pre-railway road tunnel in the country still in use. The area around Beaminster Tunnel before and after its construction (left: 1811, right: 1932). Note the changes in the alignment of the road running from the centre of the maps to the top left. =Opening= The tunnel was formally opened on 29 June 1832 with enthusiastic celebrations including a 21-gun salute fired from the top of the hill, a firework display and the launching of a hot air balloon. A procession of dignitaries, local people and the tunnel workers paraded through the tunnel accompanied by three flag-bearers, two bands, the project's patron in a four-horse open carriage and the Commissioners of the Trust and various officials in a mail wagon. A celebratory dinner was held afterwards in the White Hart inn in Beaminster, where Giles Russell was the guest of honour. A song was especially written for the occasion, including the lyrics: > The yielding soil, through able hands, A tunnel wide displays; And Lane‚Äôs > efficient aid demands Our warm, admiring praise In swelling streams may > cheering wealth To Beaminster descend: And ever joy-inspiring health Her > social sons attend. Commemorations of the opening of the tunnel became an annual tradition in Beaminster with \\"Tunnel Fairs\\" being held every Good Friday on Horn Hill until about the 1880s. In 1881, the tunnel became free to use when the tollgates were removed and the toll house at the north end was converted into a dwelling for the tunnel's lamplighter. The house was later demolished to allow the road to be widened. The two entrance portals are Grade II listed as being of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. Renovation and repairs By the 1960s, 130 years of exposure to the elements had resulted in the tunnel's brick walls crumbling from the effects of frost. To prevent falls of frost- damaged bricks, a cement mix known as gunite was sprayed onto the walls to stabilise them. However, this in turn became detached from the brickwork, and in October‚ÄìNovember 2009 the tunnel was closed to carry out repairs. The gunite layer was re-fixed to the brickwork using bolts and painted, and the drainage systems and portal arches were also renovated. The tunnel's lighting system was replaced at the same time, and the carriageway was also resurfaced. July 2012 partial collapse At around 22:10 on 7 July 2012, Rosemary Snell and Michael Rolfe, from Somerset, were driving through the tunnel and were caught in a partial collapse of the north entrance, caused by torrential rain. Several hundred tons of mud, earth, stones and vegetation fell onto the road and crushed their car, killing them. The flattened vehicle was entirely buried and was not found until 10 days later after the two were reported missing, prompting police to carry out a search of the debris. Their deaths were later ruled by a coroner to have been accidental. The local Dorset Police force was criticised for failing to find the bodies sooner and the case was voluntarily referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to be reviewed, but the IPCC subsequently declined to open an investigation. Although there were claims that tree-felling by Dorset County Council workers could have destabilised the slope above the tunnel portal, expert opinion suggested that the landslide had been triggered by a poorly-maintained drainage ditch above the tunnel breaching during the rainstorm, causing a sudden flood of water into an already saturated area. In the aftermath of the collapse, five options were put forward to remedy the tunnel, including stabilising the slope, permanently extending the tunnel, removing some of the soil from the hillside above the tunnel, removing the tunnel and building a cutting or bypassing the tunnel. A public consultation held in October 2012 found public support for the option of building a concrete hood at the entrance to the tunnel. It was estimated that this would cost about ¬£1.75 million and would take about six months to complete. The Department of Transport refused at the time to provide extra funding to meet the cost. The tunnel reopened on 29 July 2013 following ¬£2 million of work. By February 2014, it was reported that Dorset County Council had spent around ¬£2.5 million on remedial works around the tunnel.

Virgin ported the game to home computer systems MS-DOS, the Atari ST and the Archimedes, and the consoles Jaguar, Mega Drive, SNES and 3DO. The game is military-themed and based on shooting action with squad-based tactics. The player directs troops through numerous missions, battling enemy infantry, vehicles and installations. Cannon Fodder has a darkly humorous tone which commentators variously praised and condemned. Its creators intended it to convey an anti-war message, which some reviewers recognised, but the Daily Star and a number of public figures derided the game. In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines. Amiga Action awarded it an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year. Gameplay Cannon Fodder is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to five soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset, the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles such as Jeeps, tanks and helicopters as well as missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish their troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates \\\\- destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion \\\\- at less risk to their soldiers than retrieving them, but again at a greater risk of depleting ammunition. The player proceeds through 23 missions divided into several levels each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including jungle, snow and desert, some with unique terrain features and vehicles such as igloos and snowmobiles. The player must also contend with rivers (crossing which soldiers are slowed and cannot fire) and quicksand as well as mines and other booby traps. In addition to shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and-click control system more common to strategy than action games. As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, they must use caution, as well as careful planning and positioning. To this end, they can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas. Development Cannon Fodder was developed by Sensible Software, a small independent developer then of several years' standing, which had become one of the most prominent Amiga developers. Cannon Fodder \\\\- its working title from early in the development - was created after such successes as Wizkid, Mega Lo Mania and especially Sensible Soccer and was developed by six people in a \\"small, one room office\\". It was rooted in Mega Lo Mania, the \\"basic idea\\" being \\\\- according to creator Jon Hare \\\\- a strategy game in which the player \\"could send groups on missions, but that was all really.\\" The group nonetheless wanted to introduce action elements into the strategy ideas of Mega Lo Mania, giving the player \\"more direct\\" control, though retaining the mouse control and icons uncommon to shoot 'em ups. In accordance with habit Sensible's personnel eschewed storyboards when developing the starting point, instead writing descriptions of the concept and core gameplay functions. Sensible made an early decision to employ its signature \\"overhead\\" camera. Development of the basic scrolling and movement was another early step. Individual programmers then worked on various parts of the design, with the team play-testing rigorously as it went, often discarding the results of its experiments: \\"The reason we make good games is that if we put something in that turns out crap, we're not afraid to chuck it out\\", said graphics designer Stuart Cambridge. Hare elaborated: \\"[We] constructively criticise what comes out, gradually getting rid of the naff ideas and keeping any good stuff. We change it again and again and again until we get what we want.\\" A point of pride was the realistic behaviour of the homing missile code, while the rural setting of some of the levels was inspired by Emmerdale Farm. Earlier works- in-progress employed larger numbers of icons than would be featured in the final version. The mechanics also had more depth: individual soldiers had particular attributes \\\\- such as being necessary to use certain weapons or vehicles \\\\- and a greater capacity to act independently, both removed in favour of \\"instant\\" action rather than \\"war game\\" play. Final touches were the additions of the last vehicles and introductory screens. The designers named each of the game's several hundred otherwise identical protagonists, who were also awarded gravestones (varying according to the soldier's attained in-game rank) displayed on a screen between levels. Of this \\"personalisation\\", Hare said: \\"The graves show that people died, and their names mean they're not just faceless sacrifices\\". The theme was a departure from Sensible Software's usual non-violent games, and Hare stated \\"I'm only happy with this one because it makes you think 'Yes, people really die'. We're not glamourising anything, I don't think.\\" He said it was inspired by \\"all wars ever\\" and was \\"meant to be an anti-war thing.\\" He felt it would make gamers \\"realise just how senseless war is\\" and for this reason was \\"the game we've always wanted to write\\". CU Amiga however perceived \\"a fairly sick sense of humour\\" and predicted \\"The mix of satire and violence is bound to get some people pretty heated about the way such a serious subject is treated\\". Production of the game began in early 1991 but was then delayed as programmer Jools Jameson worked on Mega Drive conversions of other games. The proposed Cannon Fodder had been part of a four-game deal with Robert Maxwell's software publisher, which was liquidated after the businessman's death. Unusually for an independent developer, Sensible had little difficulty in finding publishers and after work resumed on the game, concluded a deal with Virgin in May 1993. The creators chose Virgin as it \\"seemed like a good bet\\" (Hare) as well as because of the straightforwardness of UK head Tim Chaney. Several months before its release, elements of the game were combined with Sensible Soccer, to create Sensible Soccer Meets Bulldog Blighty. This modified Sensible Soccer demo featured a mode of play that replaced the ball with a timed hand grenade. The magazine described it as a \\"1944 version of Sensible Soccer\\", though The Daily Telegraph compared it to the Christmas-time football match in 1914. Reception =Critical reception= Amiga Action said the game was \\"easily\\" the best of the year. The magazine compared it favourably to Sensible Soccer, saying the latter was \\"arguably the most playable and enjoyable game ever seen [...] At least, that was probably the best, as at this moment in time I believe this release [Cannon Fodder] to better it in terms of, well, everything.\\" The reviewer also wrote: \\"Only last month in my Frontier review, I stated that I had only given that game 93% because no game would ever be less than seven per cent from perfection. Sensible Software have forced me to eat those words almost immediately.\\" Amiga Computing praised the theme track as one of the best of the year. The reviewer could not find fault with the game and claimed to have given himself a headache in the attempt. He called it \\"one of the most playable games you will ever play and also one of the most fun. A rootin' tootin' shoot 'em up of the highest order.\\" Amiga Down Under said the game \\"rates highly on sheer entertainment value \\\\- a game you'll want to come back to time and time again\\". The reviewer's \\"only complaint\\" was that some of the missions verged \\"on the near-impossible\\". Amiga Format said \\"if there's one thing Cannon Fodder has in spades, it's addictability and killer playability.\\" The magazine also praised the graphics (\\"Great backgrounds. Excellent characters. Plenty of necessary detail\\") and sound (\\"A theme tune that sticks in your head, sound effects that work a dream \\\\- superb.\\") The reviewer said the game was \\"Extremely thought provoking\\" and \\"a highly enjoyable foray into the intelligent side of wandering around the place doing it to them before they do it to you.\\" He also said that despite the controversy, Cannon Fodder was \\"possibly the most anti-war game I've seen in a while.\\" Amiga Power's reviewer said \\"playing this game is now more important to me than eating, sleeping, or any other bodily function.\\" He praised the \\"groovetastic\\" UB40-inspired theme song, realistic sound effects and \\"intuitive\\" controls and said \\"I can't find anything wrong with the game\\". He nevertheless wrote that the lack of a two-player prevented it from scoring 100%, as well as joking that \\"It's got a finite number of levels\\" and \\"Not even real life is worth 100%.\\" The game went on to be ranked the sixth best game of all time in the history of the magazine.Amiga Power issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996 AUI also noted the lack of a two player option and said \\"23 missions will be completed sooner rather than later\\". The magazine however said \\"It is hard to criticise anything in Cannon Fodder\\" and \\"these are petty matters when compared to the sheer enjoyment of playing the game.\\" CU Amiga wrote: \\"Cannon Fodder is the best thing since gunpowder. It's bloody brilliant. It's better than sex.\\" The magazine praised the \\"toe-tapping\\" theme tune and \\"attention to sonic detail\\" in the sound effects. It noted the lack of order options but said \\"on the whole it's a very playable, very tough shoot 'em up\\". The One called the game \\"Sheer, unadulterated brilliance\\" and said \\"Cannon Fodder is quite simply one of the best strategy/action/shoot 'em ups to appear for ages.\\" The writer praised the \\"damn fine humour\\" and said \\"I can't find anything wrong with it\\". Amiga Format reported sales figures of over 100,000 for the game. Reviewing the Jaguar version, GamePro criticized that the control mechanics are imprecise and slow without the option of mouse control and that the small character graphics make it difficult to follow the action. However, they complimented the sound effects and concluded that \\"Despite its foibles, Cannon Fodder is a challenging contest that'll have you planning new strategies to overcome your failures.\\" Like GamePro, the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly complained that the characters are too small, but highly praised the fun, addictive gameplay and the sense of humor, and remarked that \\"Cannon Fodder stands high above the crowd of average Jaguar games.\\" They later awarded Cannon Fodder Best Atari Jaguar Game of 1995. Citing the high level of bloodshed and selection of vehicles, a reviewer for Next Generation assessed, \\"Put simply, this is the best Jaguar game ever. Period.\\" The 3DO version also received overall positive reviews from Electronic Gaming Monthly, Next Generation, and GamePro, with the critics largely reiterating the same praises and criticisms they gave to the Jaguar version. Electronic Gaming Monthlys review team, however, additionally remarked that the difficulty slope and accessibility make the game appealing to players of all skill levels. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, and stated that \\"This sui generis froth of strategy and action swings the needle on the old 'Just-One-More-Game' meter just a little higher.\\" In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Cannon Fodder as the 61st top retro game.Retro Gamer 8, page 67. Cannon Fodder was included in the 2011 list of the best violent video games of all time by The Daily Telegraph, with a comment that \\"this got a lot of people very upset\\" but \\"it was a relentlessly playable game, filled with dark humour and cartoony graphics.\\" That same year, Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the fifth best Amiga game.5\\\\. Cannon Fodder - 30 najlepszych gier na Amigƒô - Imperium gier, WP.PL =Controversy= The game drew criticism in the Daily Star for its juxtaposition of war and humour, its showcasing in London on Remembrance Day and especially its use of iconography closely resembling the remembrance poppy. The newspaper quoted The Royal British Legion, Liberal Democrat MP Menzies Campbell and Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, calling the game offensive to \\"millions\\", \\"monstrous\\" and \\"very unfortunate\\" respectively. Virgin Interactive initially defended the use of the poppy as an anti-war statement, which the Daily Star in turn dismissed as a \\"publicity writer's hypocrisy\\". Magazine Amiga Power became involved in the controversy because of its planned reuse of the poppy on the cover of an issue also to be released on Armistice Day. This had been changed in response to criticism in the Daily Star original article, but the newspaper published another piece focussing on a perceived inflammatory retort by Amiga Power editor Stuart Campbell: \\"Old soldiers? I wish them all dead.\\" The article featured further quotes from the British Legion. The magazine apologised for including the comment although Campbell himself felt he was \\"entitled to an opinion\\" regardless of its insensitivity. The game was ultimately released with a soldier rather than a poppy on the box art, though the poppy was still displayed on the game's title screen. Amiga Power also changed its cover after \\"legal scrapes with the British Legion over whether a poppy is just a flower or a recognisible symbol of a registered charity.\\" Stuart Campbell elsewhere pointed out that the game was ironically anti-war, while contemporary Amiga Format reviewer Tim Smith also praised the game as intelligently anti-war. Metro later acknowledged \\"a relatively profound statement on the futility of war\\" which had been unrecognised by the Daily Star. Kieron Gillen defended the game as ironic and anti-war in a retrospective. Amiga Computing reported the publicity as \\"perhaps the best advertising campaign\\" for which Virgin could have hoped.

Commission will provide a total of ‚Ç¨24 million in funding to support the project.News by Eltis, retrieved on 25 May 2012 According to the EU Commissioner for Transport, Siim Kallas, Green eMotion aims to link the currently ongoing regional and national electromobility initiatives, apply their results, and compare the different technology approaches, to support the best possible solutions for the European market. This platform will allow for co-operation among the various players and promote both new, high-quality transportation services and convenient payment systems for the users of electric vehicles.cf. Interview with Siim Kallas: \\"St√§dte k√∂nnen Vorreiter der Elektromobilit√§t sein\\", retrieved on 16 July 2012 Thus, the Commission is paving the way for the creation of a mass market for electric vehicles in the EU.
