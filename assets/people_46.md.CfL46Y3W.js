He finished the cathedral towerLuis Garc√≠a Ballester, Historia de la ciencia y de la t√©cnica en la Corona de Castilla, Volume 1, 2002, p. 555. and it is possible that he built the Chapel of √Ålvaro de Luna and also of his brother, both of which can be found inside the cathedral. Therefore, it is quite likely that he was also involved in the construction of Escalona Castle. He worked alongside his brother Egas Cueman on the chapter house of Cuenca Cathedral in 1454. Furthermore, he probably restored the choir of the same cathedral based on his previous works in Toledo. Hannequin also worked on the chapel of Master Pedro Gir√≥n. It is quite likely that he created the foundations of the Castle of Belmonte (Cuenca), for Juan Pacheco in 1456. This is a unique castle of its type due to its exterior aspect which has nine curtain walls and six slight towers that seem to form pincers. In 1465 he appeared with his son, Hanequin de Cuellar, in Cuellar to carry out the renovations and extensions of the castle of Beltr√°n de la Cueva, Duke of Albuquerque, who had taken possession of the village for the first time a year before. Albuquerque wanted to reinforce the construction because of Isabella I of Castile's views on the ownership of Cuellar. He had a barbican built all around the castle, extending the bailey.Maria Rosario Mondejar Manzanares, El Castillo de Cuellar, Segovia, 2007.

This was the beginning of the longest struggle in South Korea thus far, lasting over 1,000 days. Two years prior, these women had been hired by the Korea Railroad Corporation (KORAIL) as irregular workers with the promise of becoming regular workers with the appropriate benefits and compensation after one year of employment. However, in 2006, because of a change in management, KORAIL forced the workers to accept reduced benefits and wages as well as coercing the workers to perform additional work outside of their traditional duties. In addition to these unfair labor practices, KTX train attendants also reported experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace. All of these issues culminated into approximately 400 female workers joining 17,000 male workers from the Korean Railway Workers' Union (KRWU) on March 1 in the 2006 strike against KORAIL. The majority of the men from the KRWU stopped protesting after 4 days; however, the women continued their strike. Over the course of 12 years, many workers dropped out of the strike; however, 180 continued until 2018 when the Railway Workers' Union and KORAIL came to an agreement in which these 180 of the crew members were reinstated.  Background  KORAIL hired these women as irregular workers through the company, Hongikhoe, with the promise that they would become regular workers after one year of employment. However, KORAIL changed its management of the KTX train attendants to KTX Tourism Leisure and forced the workers to accept the reduced benefits and wages with the threat of difficulties during future rehiring processes. In addition to reports of sexual harassment, the workers were also forced into additional work outside their traditional duties, such as greeting customers while wearing hanbok (traditional Korean dresses). = Irregular employment = The KTX train attendants fall into the category of \\"atypical or non-standard employment arrangement\\" of irregular employment because they were hired full-time employment responsibilities without the benefits, compensation, or protection that should be guaranteed with such duties. Irregular employment entails lower wages, less benefits, and increased job insecurity, and recently, has seen an increase especially for women. Even though workers may be required to uphold the responsibilities of a regular employee, they are reclassified legally, so that management does not have the legal obligation to follow labor laws. In addition to experiencing sexual harassment and reduced compensation and benefits, the female KTX workers were also officially employed in subordinate positions compared to men, even though they had similar responsibilities. = Union = As a result of deregulations and privatization of telecommunication and railway companies in South Korea, companies had more freedom while labor unions had more difficulty in maintaining balanced power between employers and employees.Kwon, H. (2010). Labor and Public Sector Restructuring in South Korea: a Comparative Analysis of Telecommunications and Railways. Ph.D. Cornell University. Even though all unions were affected by the privatization of businesses, unions differ in their responses to defend workers in that some chose to organize and respond with protests or similar militancy while others cooperated with the government. KRWU, the union for the KTX workers, was one of the unions that had an increase in political access during the privatization process of the railway company and therefore was able to gain support and alliances. By the end of 2005, a majority of the female workers had joined the KRWU. The strike that began in 2006 is not singular in regards to protest by irregularly employed women. One of the first struggles occurred in 1998 against their own union, the Hyundai Motors Union. At that time, the Korean Women Workers Associations United (KWWAU) was limited in its power as it was an NGO and not a union. In August 1999, the KWWAU established the national Korean Women's Trade Union (KWTU), which allows any woman to join as a member of the union, even irregularly employed women workers.  Strike  On March 1, 2006, 400 female workers joined 17,000 male workers in a strike against KORAIL. After 4 days, the male protestors returned to work; however, the remaining KTX train attendants continued for the next 1000 days using varying forms of protest, such as head shaving, fasting, sit-in on iron towers, iron chaining. A particularly shocking protest took the form of KTX train attendants in their uniforms with white masks painted with large black \\"X's\\" while their bodies were shackled with chains. One month after the strike began, KORAIL Tourism Leisure sent text messages to the female workers on strike that their contracts were canceled, but that they would be rehired if the strike ended. The women did not stop the strike. KORAIL fired 280 crew members who refused to rejoin the company. In May 2006, approximately 80 female workers were arrested for occupying the KORAIL office in Seoul. In January 2007, KTX union leaders organized a sit-in at the Seoul central station, which continued on and off until July 2018. In August 2008, 3 unionists held a sit-in that lasted 20 days at the top of a lighting tower. In December 2008, 34 workers still on strike filed a lawsuit to reaffirm that they were employees of the Urban Railway Public Corporation. They won both trials of 2009 and 2011. KORAIL paid the workers four years worth of pay back but did not rehire them; it also brought the case to the Supreme Court. In 2012, around 100 laid-off workers also filed a lawsuit and were able to win at the first trial but not the second one. On February 26, 2015, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict of the first and second trials, stating that the KTX female workers were not employees of the Urban Railway Public Corporation. They deemed that the female crew workers were not involved with \\"safety work.\\" Following the Supreme Court's verdict, KORAIL won an injunction to collect \\"an average of KRW 86.4 million ($76,000)\\" that it had previously paid to each laid off crew member. In March 2016, a 36 year old former attendant committed suicide, leaving a note to her three-year-old daughter \\"I am sorry, my baby. All I can leave with you is debt.\\" On July 20, 2018, the Railway Workers' Union and KORAIL came to an agreement to resolve the issue. The KTX members who were laid off in 2006 would be reinstated and have employment status. This agreement excluded those who were previously employed in KORAIL's headquarters or subsidiary companies. = Support = In August 2007, the Korean Professors Association (gyosu moim) issued a petition that garnered international solidarity against KORAIL. The petition had signatures from approximately 200 professors in 18 different countries. On December 3, 2007, it was delivered to the CEO of KORAIL. Later that month, the CEO of KORAIL, Mr. Chul Lee sent a letter replying to the 200 professors, stating that the petition consisted of \\"one-sided assertions.\\"  References  Strikes (protest) ","title":"South Korean KTX Train Attendant Union Strike"},{"id":"60510742","text":"Bishop Gunn is a 4-piece blues Americana rock and roll country band from Natchez, Mississippi. It consists of Travis McCready (vocals/guitar/harmonica), Ben Lewis (bass/ backing vocals), Burne Sharpe (drums/ backing vocals) and Drew Smithers (Lead guitar/ backing vocals). Bishop Gunn are influenced by artists such as Wilson Pickett, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Soundgarden. The band are named after a tombstone they saw in Natchez, that was over the resting place of the sixth Bishop of Natchez, John Edward Gunn.  History  Frontman Travis McCready left his blue-collar job working as a welder in a steel mill to pursue a career in music full-time. Drummer Burne Sharpe was searching for a singer to perform with for a festival date, so they met and performed together at Great Mississippi River Balloon Race in 2014. The band was joined by former marine Ben Lewis on bass, then the Bishop Gunn line-up was completed in 2017 when they met guitarist Drew working in a guitar shop in Nashville.  Music career  Bishop Gunn recorded their first EP in Leipers Fork at producer Casey Wasner‚Äôs studio, The Purple House, and it was self-released on own label Farm2Turntable in February 2016. The EP tracks included: \\"Let the people know\\", \\"Eye of a hurricane\\", \\"Have your way with me\\", \\"Bank of the river\\" and \\"Riders\\". The band played together regularly at Smoot‚Äôs Grocery in Natchez and played regularly in 2017 in Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana including playing shows in the fall of 2017 supporting Lynyrd Skynyrd. Bishop Gunn worked on a new album throughout 2017 recording with new guitarist Drew at Muscle Shoals Sound, The Purple House and Fame Studios. They released their debut full-length album titled Natchez named after their hometown on May 4th 2018. Bishop Gunn played a SXSW showcase in March 2018, then toured with The Marcus King band, Blackberry Smoke, Whiskey Myers and played two cruises with Kid Rock. In May 2018 the band launched their first \\"Bishop Gunn Crawfish Boil‚Äù (BGCB) festival in Natchez, Mississippi. The event sold around 4000 tickets and took place in Bluff Park, Natchez. The band released first single \\"Shine\\" from new album Natchez in May 2018 to coincide with the festival. Directed by Tyler Barksdale the video, set in Natchez features people in different jobs and positions working in Natchez, from the Natchez Brewery to the steel mill Travis McCready once worked in. The band were included in Rolling Stone magazine's \\"10 New Country Artists You Need to Know: May 2018\\" along with The Felice Brothers and Maren Morris. The band released a second single from Natchez titled \\"Alabama\\" in October 2018 together with a video that featured comedian and broadcaster Theo Von. The story of the recording of the track \\"Alabama\\" is that Bishop Gunn were heading to the recently reopened Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals to record \\"Alabama\\" when they received a phone call telling them that Rick Hall, the studio's owner for more than 50 years, had passed away. At the urging of Hall's son, Rodney, Bishop Gunn continued driving to Fame, where they recorded \\"Alabama\\" with help from a number of local musicians, including rapper GMane who later starred in the music video. The video was produced and directed again by Nashville director Tyler Barksdale and features and eerie baptism scene replete with snakes and Pentecostal worship. The video was part of a series of videos that tell a story inspired on the song. In 2019 the band released a video for Makin‚Äô It' from the album 'Natchez', directed once again by Tyler Barksdale. The song (about the death of Travis McCready's brother) was featured in Rolling Stone magazine's top 10 country and Americana songs of February 2019. The band also won the Classic Rock magazine poll with the song in the same month. The band embarked on their first European tour February 2019 headlining shows from Dublin, to Cologne, including their first London show. The band also supported The Struts in Paris, then joined Slash for a run of European dates.

For the academic year 1933‚Äì1934 he studied theoretical physics at the University of Cambridge. In 1935/36 he worked for the Jahrbuch √ºber die Fortschritte der Mathematik. As a convinced pacifist (associated with the Quakers) and a political dissident, he left Germany. In 1937/38 he was a research assistant at the University College in Southampton and from 1938 to 1940 at the Free University of Brussels. After internment at Camp de Gurs in the Pyrenees, he succeeded in escaping to the United States in 1941. He was from 1942 to 1946 at Harvard University, in 1946/47 at the Franklin Institute, in 1947/48 at the Institute for Advanced Study, from 1947 to 1949 at the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1949 to 1959 at the University of Nebraska. At George Washington University he was a professor from 1959 until his retirement in 1972 as professor emeritus. After his retirement he was a visiting professor at the University of Maryland, at the National Cancer Institute, at the University of Uppsala, and at the University of Amsterdam.

He mounted an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the Norfolk City Council in 1978. Copeland ran for political office again in 1980, winning election to the Virginia House of Delegates, on which he served until losing reelection in 1995. During Copeland's 1995 legislative campaign, he altered a photograph of a bill-signing ceremony, giving the impression that only he was the only state legislator alongside Governor George Allen. Copeland's loss to Thelma Drake, whom he was facing for the second time, was considered a major upset, as the 87th House district was the only constituency in which a Republican candidate unseated a Democratic incumbent.

Tallon (12 March 1969 ‚Äì 16 November 2018) was a Belgian art historian. He used lasers to create a precise model of Notre-Dame de Paris, among other buildings. Early life and education Tallon was born on 12 March 1969 in Leuven, Belgium to mother Mary Beth Tallon Vander Vennet and father Andrew F. Tallon. In the fourth grade, Tallon lived in Paris while his mother worked on a dissertation in theater history. He attended high school in the US, graduating from Shorewood High School in Wisconsin. Tallon attended Princeton University for his undergraduate studies where he earned a degree in music in 1991. While enrolled, however, he took every class taught by Robert Mark--an engineer specializing in Gothic architecture and construction. He received an MA at Paris-Sorbonne University and a PhD at Columbia University under the advisement of Stephen Murray, an art historian. Career Beginning in 2007, Tallon worked at Vassar College in the Department of Art. Tallon described himself as \\"obsessed\\" with Notre-Dame de Paris. He used laser scanners to map the interior and exterior of the Notre-Dame, as well as 45 other historical buildings. Tallon began scanning Notre-Dame in 2010 with Paul Blaer, going over the interior and exterior of the building. All told, they repositioned the scanner fifty times for comprehensive detail, resulting in over one billion points of data. After the Notre-Dame de Paris fire in 2019, Tallon's work mapping the building's interior was cited as a potential resource for planned reconstruction. In addition to Paris, other French cathedrals he mapped were in Bourges, Chartres, and Sens. Along with Stephen Murray, Tallon initiated the Mapping Gothic France project, which was funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Mapping Gothic France is an open source project created to \\"establish linkages between the architectural space of individual buildings, geo-political space, and the social space resulting from the interaction (collaboration and conflict) between multiple agents--builders and users\\". In December 2014, Tallon mapped the Canterbury Cathedral in England, collecting 5.5 billion data points over the course of two and a half days. Tallon repositioned the scanner slightly fewer than one hundred times to obtain comprehensive coverage. This work resulted in the first accurate sectional views of the cathedral. Tallon was a member of the Society of Architectural Historians from 2006 to 2017. He was a founder of the Friends of Notre-Dame Foundation, a US-based organization that sought to collect donations for maintenance and renovations for Notre-Dame. Awards and honors Tallon contributed to a television documentary called Building the Great Cathedrals which first aired on Nova (part of PBS) in 2010. The program received two Emmy nominations: for Outstanding Science and Technology Programming, and for Outstanding Cinematography, News Coverage/Documentaries. An art exhibition based on Tallon's work was displayed in Notre-Dame, called \\"Notre-Dame of Paris: Nine Centuries in the Life of a Cathedral\\". Personal life Tallon was married to Marie Tallon-Daudruy and had four children. Tallon died of brain cancer on 16 November 2018 at his home in Poughkeepsie, New York.

He was returned as Member of Parliament for Wendover by a considerable majority at a by-election on 18 March 1728, presumably due to his distant cousin Lord Limerick, the other sitting Member. He was consulted by the 1st Lord Egmont on Irish matters in 1731, when he drafted a petition and bill to allow unenumerated commodities to go direct to Ireland from the colonies, instead of through Great Britain. He supported the Government, voting with them on the army in 1732 and the excise bill in 1733.

Early life  Goldberg was born and grew up in Tel Aviv. His parents, Gad Goldberg, born in Lublin (Poland) and Rachel Raya (n√©e Farber), born in Vilnius (Lithuania), immigrated to Palestine shortly after Hitler became Germany's chancellor in 1933. Career After completing his undergraduate studies, Goldberg served in the Israel Defense Forces for three years. Released at the rank of captain, he resumed his studies, earning his Ph.D. from Tel Aviv University in 1973 under the supervision of Saul Abarbanel. After a postdoctoral position at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), he joined the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in 1979, and in due course became the Ruth and Samuel Jaffe Professor of Mathematics. In 2013 he retired as Professor Emeritus. Research Goldberg has published over 80 research papers and given over 100 talks at international conferences. His co- authors include Richard F. Arens, Michael Cwikel, Robert Guralnick, Thomas J. Laffey, W. A. J. Luxemburg, Ernst G. Straus, and Eitan Tadmor. His visits to some of the world's leading universities have included sabbaticals at UCLA, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and Universit√© Paris Dauphine (Paris 9). He has served on over 20 editorial boards of mathematical journals and on numerous national and international professional committees. Goldberg began his scientific career by studying computational fluid mechanics. He then turned to a variety of other topics, including finite-difference approximations to hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential systems, linear and Multilinear algebra, matrix and operator theory, functional analysis, and various types of algebras. A substantial part of his work has focused on various aspects of norms, seminorms, and subnorms. One such project deals with a natural extension of the classical spectral radius to finite- dimensional power-associative algebras. This study, which encompasses the Cayley‚ÄìDickson algebras, is relevant to stability of norms and subnorms, and to the well-known Gelfand formula.See items 17 and 19 in selected publications.

The park is at the northeast corner of the intersection of South Lane Street and 7th Avenue South, near the eastern edge of the CID. It was built in 1981, renovated in 2012, and features a bronze dragon play sculpture by Gerard Tsutakawa. Features and description The affectionate nickname \\"Dragon Park\\" derives from The Dragon, a bronze dragon sculpture and play structure created by Tsutakawa in 1978 under a commission from the Parks Department. The original circular center of the park was divided into a yin-yang shape, with the southern half as a grass lawn and the northern half as a sand play area. The bronze dragon was originally located in the sand portion. The northeastern corner of the original park featured \\"The Mountain\\", a small rock hill for climbing with a slide from the top into the sand area, connected by a bridge on the eastern edge of the park to another pile of rocks and a play structure in the southeastern corner. The northwest corner had a \\"Neon Pavilion\\" with seating, and the southwest corner (at the corner of 7th and Lane) had a large stone berm/planter. The park was updated in 2012, removing the berm/planter in the southwest corner and rearranging elements of the play structures. \\"The Mountain\\" was replaced by seating. History Land for the International Children's Park was donated by Dennis Su in the late 1970s. The original design for the park is credited to Joey Ing and the landscape architect Thomas Berger. The original International Children's Park opened in 1981. Because of poor visibility from the street and potential safety issues, the park was underutilized. =Renovation= In 2007, the community organization Friends of International Children's Park (FICP) was formed to explore options to update the park's design. FICP partnered with the Department of Landscape Architecture at the University of Washington (led by Professor Jeff Hou) and the Wilderness Inner-city Leadership Development (WILD) program for a collaborative exploration of potential designs. The redesign emphasized making the park more inviting for adults accompanying children to the park. In 2008, $500,000 to restore the park was authorized by the Parks and Green Spaces levy, which also provided $3 million for the Hing Hay Park expansion. In total, the redesign cost $750,000, with the balance made up by donors. The draft design concepts for International Children's Park were finished by the landscape architect Karen Kiest. Several design workshops were held in 2009 to present three concepts for community review and comment; Kiest planned to retain most of the existing trees along the north and east edges of the park and expand the southwest corner as a curb extension. The final developed concept relocated the dragon to the northern edge of the park and kept the play structures along the eastern edge, allowing for a potential future expansion should the narrow parking lot east of the park be acquired by the city. The renovation also added new artistic elements from Stuart Nakamura based on toys from the Asia-Pacific cultures of the Chinatown-International District: \\"Spin\\" (a spinning top in stainless steel), \\"I-Ching Coin\\", and \\"SepakTakraw Ball\\". The grand re-opening of the park was held on March 3, 2012. =Donnie Chin= Donald Gregory (Donnie) Chin (October 7, 1955 ‚Äì July 23, 2015) founded the International District Emergency Center (IDEC) in 1968 as police and fire services were generally slow to respond to emergency calls in the CID. Chin provided first responder services through IDEC on a volunteer basis for decades until he was shot and killed during a suspected gun battle between two rival groups in the early morning of July 23, 2015. the murder is still unsolved. Spontaneous tributes to Chin following his death included a \\"crossed-ladder\\" salute from the Seattle Fire Department and flowers left at his family's shop in Canton Alley. Mayor Ed Murray, Governor Jay Inslee, and former King County Executive Ron Sims also paid tribute to Chin. Mayor Murray launched a campaign to rename the International District Childrens Park to Donnie Chin International Childrens Park in February 2016. Chin was called \\"instrumental in the creation of the [original] park\\", as he had identified the need for a children's park in the CID during the 1970s. In June 2016, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to rename the park, making an exception for Chin, as typical city park policy requires renaming requests to wait until three years after death.

She is best known for being the Director of Hearings in the presidential administration of her then brother-in-law Carlos Menem, and for being charged in the drug money laundering scandal which came to be called Yomagate. Her nickname \\"Amira\\" means \\"princess\\" in Arabic. She is the youngest of eight siblings, including and Zulema Yoma. Other notable members of her family are her cousin , her brother-in-law Carlos Menem, and her niece Zulema Menem. Biography From ages 6 to 20, Amira Yoma lived in Damascus, Syria, where she would learn to speak Arabic. She returned at the request of her sister Zulema. In 1983 she began working with Carlos Menem as Director of Hearings in La Rioja Province, then went on to hold a position at the provincial bank. In late 1986 she married Ibrahim al Ibrahim, and they lived in Wilde until 1989 when they moved to Buenos Aires. They divorced later that year. Also in 1989, after Menem's election as president, Yoma would be designated Director of National Hearings, the most prominent office of the Casa Rosada after the president's. In the early years of the administration she was an emblematic figure in official meetings and among Menem's favorites. In 1991 she was forced to resign due to a drug money laundering scandal, which would also affect her ex-husband Ibrahim al Ibrahim, who was in charge of the Ezeiza customs office. At the president's direction, several attempts were made to grant her some political function, one of which was denied by Guido di Tella, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Yoma also called the FrePaSo deputy Graciela Fern√°ndez Meijide to request that her return to power not be fiercely criticized by the opposition. In her declaration before the Senate on 1 December 1994, she would take responsibility for issuing a passport to arms dealer Monzer al-Kassar. In 1995 she married journalist Jorge \\"Chacho\\" Marchetti and, that same year, she would travel to Spain to meet with the Narcogate judge, Baltasar Garz√≥n. She was rarely interviewed on television, granting exceptions to Mirtha Legrand and Mariano Grondona. After several years with a low profile, Yoma returned to the government in August 1998, when she was appointed as an advisor to the White Helmets Commission for six months. The government justified this appointment, which she celebrated on Legrand's program on 18 August 1998 and which carried a monthly salary of 1,730 pesos, based on her mastery of Arabic. Her strong personality brought her into conflict with White Helmets leader , so she left the post. As a result, she asked her ex-brother-in-law to relocate her, and she was eventually hired by the then Ministry of Labor and Social Security. When she was discovered by the press in a new political position, she explained her hiring: \\"I do different things, but I cannot speak of them.\\" On 7 May 1999 she became part of the orbit of Antonio Erman Gonz√°lez in the Ministry of Labor with a salary of 4,000 pesos. After this, according to her statement, she rejected a proposal to be an advisor to the Ministry of Social Development offered by then minister Jos√© Figueroa, \\"because it did not seem ethical to have another contract.\\" She became unemployed after Gonz√°lez resigned as minister. She next moved to Marbella, where many Syrians lived, and where her husband \\"Chacho\\" Marchetti decided to open a restaurant. Despite this, four police officers continued to guard her house in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of , as it was said that she was on an official mission. The business closed due to a mad cow scare, and the couple returned to Buenos Aires. Yomagate or Narcogate In the 1990s, Cali Cartel accountant Ram√≥n Humberto Puentes was arrested in Punta del Este at the request of Spanish judge Baltasar Garz√≥n, on suspicion of smuggling cocaine into Uruguay. Among his belongings was a hardcover notebook that exposed figures of Argentine power at the time. Amira Yoma was mentioned as moving a \\"cargo\\" from New York, in an entry reading \\"Amira 720 (‚Äì 50)\\". After further investigation, the name of her then husband Ibrahim al Ibrahim, who had been appointed head of the customs office of Ezeiza by decree of Vice President Eduardo Duhalde, was also found, designated as having moved \\"7,559,000 dollars\\". On 1 March 1991, the Spanish magazine Cambio 16 published that Judge Garz√≥n was investigating figures of power very close to Carlos Menem, including Amira Yoma, Ibrahim al Ibrahim, and Mario Caserta, Undersecretary of Public Services. According to an informant, the job of Yoma and Ibrahim was to pick up suitcases of money in New York and take them to Buenos Aires as sealed baggage, where they were then collected and taken to Uruguay. In July 1992, Yoma was arrested and released on bail on the charge of bringing suitcases with \\"narco-dollars\\" into the country. Her case would eventually be dismissed by the Argentine court in April 1994 at the request of the prosecutor Carlos Stornelli and recorded by chamber secretary , despite the fact that the Spanish justice system continued with the international arrest warrant. 2004‚Äìpresent Yoma was in court on another charge in 2004, this time for alleged irregularities in credits contracted by the family tannery Yoma SA, known as the Yoma Group, with national, provincial, and city banks. The family's entire case would be dismissed that September by federal judge Claudio Bonadio. In November 2009 while Yoma was driving her car to a friend's house, she was intercepted and her vehicle was fired at twice before she escaped. Then, at 3:00 am, she received a phone call in which she was threatened. \\"Enough doing press. We're going to kill you. You are going to have to leave the country.\\" On a television program in October 2012, Yoma spoke about the incident with the suitcases: Amira Yoma currently runs a Middle Eastern restaurant in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Belgrano with her husband, former journalist Jorge \\"Chacho\\" Marchetti.

Biography Matteson was born in Tranek√¶r, Langeland, Denmark in 1835 to Hans C. and Karen Sonia Johanson Mathiason. Even though he came from a poor family, he was given a good education in literature and music. Two years after starting work as a postal clerk, he became an immigrant to the United States in 1855 with his parents and two sisters and made their home in New Denmark, Wisconsin. Matteson became a Christian at the age of 24 and the next year went to a Baptist seminary in Chicago to become a minister. After his graduation two years later, he married Anna Sieverson, who had been born in Tromso, Norway. They later had seven children together. They moved to Wisconsin, where Matteson ministered to a Danish-speaking Baptist church. Matteson and his wife became Seventh-day Adventists in 1863, and Matteson converted almost all of the members of the Baptist church, making it the second Scandinavian Seventh-day Adventist Church in the United States. Matteson became an evangelist and preached the Seventh-day Adventist message of the love of God. From his preaching, many churches were established in the Midwest. He wrote the first Danish language tract, \\"Det Nye Testamentes Sabbat\\" (\\"The New Testament Sabbath\\"). He also edited the first Seventh-day Adventist Danish-Norwegian songbook. Matteson became editor of The Advent Tidende at the age of 37, a Scandinavian magazine for members in the United States. This magazine was also sent to Scandinavia which sparked a large interest in the Seventh-day Adventist Church and a request for missionaries. Matteson and his family moved to Denmark in 1877, his preaching in Denmark and Norway led many to be baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The growth of the church was so great that in 1880 the first conference was established outside the United States, with headquarters in Christiana. Matteson started publishing the magazine Tidernes Tegn (Signs of the Times) in 1879 and Sundhedsbladet (The Health Magazine) in 1881 and a songbook which he wrote. He founded a publishing house in Christiana it published books, magazines, and tracts that led to many baptisms. Matteson came back to the United States in 1888, and continued to be editor of the church's Scandinavian publications. He also taught Bible classes in the Danish-Norwegian department at Union College. Halfway through his third year at Union College, he became sick and went to live with his son in Southern California, hoping to get better. Matteson died two months later from chronic bronchitis.John Gottlieb Matteson International Adventist Musicians Association Retrieved April 16, 2019 He died March 30, 1896 at 60 years old, in Los Angeles County. Matteson is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica, Los Angeles County. His autobiography Mattesons Liv (\\"The Life of Matteson\\") is available in Danish and English.

The song was written by Madonna and her son David Banda, alongside her longtime collaborator Mirwais, while produced by Madonna and the latter of the three. It features the Batukadeiras Orchestra, an all-women group that play drums on the song. It is a batuque song with influences of Afrobeat, featuring a call and response structure, and the lyrics of the song are about \\"overcoming adversity\\". \\"Batuka\\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with some deeming it as one of the album's highlights. An accompanying music video for the song was released on July 19, 2019, which was an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of the first time Madonna met the Batukadeiras Orchestra, as well as their journey together. The song was included on Madonna's 2019‚Äì2020 Madame X Tour, with the group performing in a semi-circle, playing drums, while Madonna performed batuque moves. Background and recording In 2017, Madonna relocated to Lisbon when seeking a top football academy for her son David Banda, who wanted to become a professional association football player. While living in the city, she began meeting artists; painters and musicians, who would invite her to \\"living room sessions\\". In the sessions, they would bring food and sit around the table, and musicians would start playing instruments, singing Fado and samba music. One of the first musicians Madonna met was a man named Dino D'Santiago, who introduced her to the Batukadeiras Orchestra, a collective of drummers from Cape Verde; the members ranged from teenage girls to older women. Madonna described her first encounter with them as an \\"amazing\\" experience, stating that their music was \\"mesmerizing and hypnotizing\\" and left her impressed as she had never heard anything like that. After meeting, they agreed on recording a song for Madonna's new album, Madame X. In the recording studio, the singer wrote down some words that she encouraged the Batukadeiras Orchestra to \\"just repeat\\" after her. Through D'Santiago, who acted as a translator, she explained to them the meaning of the song; according to Madonna, the group liked it as their philosophy was about \\"fighting for their rights and empowering women\\". After recording the song, they insisted on everyone in the studio all praying together, afterwards the Batukadeiras Orchestra blessed Madonna and wished her well. The singer commented that it was a positive encounter and a moment of \\"hugging and tears\\". According to Madonna, the first title of the song was \\"Fernalism\\" because it was meant to be a feminist manifesto, and she also did not want to say \\"feminism\\" due to her feeling it sounded conventional or predictable. Once she realized it was too abstract, the singer retitled the song to \\"Batuka\\" because according to her, \\"that's what it is, that's the style of music that it is. That seemed to work. Created by women, played by women.\\" Composition and lyrics \\"Batuka\\" was written by Madonna, Mirwais and Banda, while production was handled by the singer and Mirwais. Madonna stated that even though all of her children sing on the song, Banda was the only one who asked for songwriting credits. It was described as a batuque song, with influences of Afrobeat. It features drums played by the Batukadeiras Orchestra, and a call and response structure, with the group singing their own solos in the Cape Verdean Creole language. The lyrics deal with \\"overcoming adversity\\", while Madonna warns of \\"a storm ahead\\" over vocodered vocals. The lyrics \\"Get that old man/put him in a jail/where he can‚Äôt stop us\\" were considered a reference to current President of the United States Donald Trump. Will Hodgkinson from The Times noted that the song \\"has a wayward quality reminiscent of Brazil's late-1960s tropicalia movement\\", while Lucy O'Brien, writing for The Guardian, commented that it \\"has a dark, percussive female power\\". Critical reception Justin Ravitz from Refinery29 called the track \\"a defiant, joyful cry for rebellion with a rousing call-and-response structure\\". Nicholas Hautman of Us Weekly stated the song was \\"literally a banger\\", while C. M. from The Economist called it \\"hypnotic\\". C.M.'s opinion was shared by The Quietus CJ Thorpe-Tracey. For musicOMHs Nick Smith, the song \\"could almost have been lifted from a Nelly Furtado album\\", while for Craig Jenkins from New York magazine, \\"Batuka\\" is \\"the kind of drum-driven call-and- response number M.I.A. and Diplo sold to the international community on Piracy Funds Terrorism 15 years ago\\". Xavi Sancho from El Pa√≠s wrote that the Batukadeiras Orchestra gives \\"a martial rhythm to something that could be a mix between Gwen Stefani and Carlinhos Brown and that ends in something, again, fresh and rich\\". Mike Wass of Idolator commented that the song successfully \\"combines a choir, African instruments and a Portuguese drum collective\\", while calling it \\"dynamic and utterly compelling\\". Sean Maunier from Metro Weekly opined that the song \\"may be the greatest departure for Madonna\\", and that her accompanied by the \\"all-women Batukadeiras Orchestra, produc[es] an absolutely otherworldly effect\\". Kristi Kates of the Northern Express newspaper said that fans would appreciate songs like \\"Batuka\\" on the album. Varietys Jeremy Helligar was similarly positive, selecting the song as one of the highlights from Madame X. Robbie Barnett from the Washington Blade noted that the song was one of \\"the most notable examples of the influence Portugal has injected into Madonna since she moved to Lisbon\\", coming off \\"like a fabulous jam session\\". Alexandra Pollard from The Independent classified it as a \\"rabble-rousing chant\\". In a mixed review, Wren Graves of Consequence of Sound commented that the Batukadeiras Orchestra provide a \\"much-needed spark\\" to \\"Batuka\\", though called the song \\"repetitive\\". A negative review was provided by Daniel Megarry from Gay Times, who ranked it as the last track on his list of Madame Xs best tracks, saying, \\"Unfortunately, this song just didn't do anything for us. Nothing. Na-dah. Zilch.\\" Music video Filming for the music video for \\"Batuka\\" took place during April 2019, in Praia de S√£o Juli√£o of Sintra, Portugal. It was directed by Emmanuel Adjei, who was also director of the video for \\"Dark Ballet\\" (2019), and premiered on July 19, 2019 through Refinery29. In an interview with the website, Madonna said that she and the directing team wanted to honor how she met the Batukadeiras Orchestra and their journey together, with an \\"organic\\" and \\"beautiful cinematic\\" experience. They found a house that looked like a typical one from Cape Verde, and chose a more natural environment for their first meeting place, with Madonna saying it \\"wasn't easy to replicate the significance of our first meeting and how it all happened\\". Madonna elaborated, stating that she hoped it \\"captures the range of emotions that I felt coming from them, and their music\\", wanting to show the strength and the history, as well as how \\"expressive\\" she felt like their faces were and having wanted to capture it in the close-ups. Madonna, surrounded by the Batukadeiras Orchestra, during the song's music video The music video begins with a message that reads, \\"Batuque is a style of music created by women that originated in Cape Verde, some say the birth place of slave trade. The drums were condemned by the Church and taken away from the slaves because it was considered an act of rebellion. The women continued their singing and dancing and the Batuque lives on today\\". It cuts to scenes focusing on the women of the Batukadeiras Orchestra, showing a series of portraits of their faces while they sing, beat out rhythms on drums, walk, and stand on a clifftop, from which the group look out to the sea. Madonna then appears, wearing a green and black dress, distinguished from the white-garbed women. Madonna performs a freestyle dance, as she thought that \\"there was no need or call for choreography. The dancing was organic and fluid; I just watched them move and joined them.\\" Upon its release, it received positive reviews from critics. Little Black Book website staff called the video \\"groundbreaking\\", and said: \\"Arguably no music video, in more than 70 videos that Madonna has made in her incredible career, has been more like an authentic document of a real event\\", while they deemed it as a \\"heartfelt expression of the power of music to cross boundaries, to raise spirits, and to heal\\". Ravitz branded the visual \\"striking\\", while Attitude and Rolling Stone labeled it as \\"stunning\\". Kirsten Spruch from Billboard noted how the video references Portugal's \\"brutal history\\". The staff of P√∫blico opined that it was \\"full of emotion\\" and \\"willing to put its finger on the colonial wound, with ghost caravels\\". Mike Nied from Idolator said that \\"she has, once again, expertly achieved her goals\\" of capturing the emotions Madonna felt from the Batukadeiras Orchestra. Live performance Madonna included \\"Batuka\\" on the setlist of her 2019‚Äì2020 Madame X Tour. She was joined by 14 of the 22 women of the Batukadeiras Orchestra while performing. The performance began with the group gathering around in a semi-circle and pounding away at drums, while Madonna sat to the side on a stairwell before eventually joining them, and doing some \\"hip-shimmying\\" batuque moves. According to Bradley Stern from Paper magazine, the performance was \\"essentially the song's music video come to life\\". For Leslie Katz of San Francisco Examiner, it was \\"the evening's most joyous number\\", while Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic said it was \\"one of a number of relatively shapeless Madame X songs improved in person by intensity and imagery\\".

Prior to that, he was provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and vice-chancellor in the royal court, and briefly elected Bishop of V√°c. Early career Theodore was born into a prominent Transdanubian family, which originated from Tengerd in Fej√©r County. His father was vice-judge royal Nicholas I, who bought the village and the surrounding lands in 1256. Theodore had two elder brothers, Nicholas II and Ladislaus I, who actively participated in the royal military campaigns against the Kingdom of Bohemia in the early 1270s. Ladislaus had a daughter Anne, who married James Hah√≥t. The brothers' branch died out by the middle of the 14th century. The Rumi and the Botka de Sz√©plak noble families descended from Theodore's uncles.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Tengerdi kinship 1. Rumi branch) Theodore was first mentioned by contemporary records in 1274, when Ladislaus IV of Hungary recovered the estate of Sitke and donated Chuef√∂ld, which then belonged to Szolgagy≈ër Castle (present-day ruins in Hlohovec, Slovakia), to the three brothers for the bravery and loyalty of Nicholas and Ladislaus in the previous years. As the youngest one, Theodore entered ecclesiastical service. He bore the title of \\"magister\\", demonstrating his potential education and skills in science. Consequently, he perhaps attended a foreign universitas. He elevated into the dignity of provost of Szeben (today Sibiu, Romania) by 1284, serving in this office until 1287. Simultaneously, he also acted as a personal notary of King Ladislaus IV. Theodore was also a confidant of the queen mother, Elizabeth the Cuman and the queen consort Elizabeth of Sicily: the two queens jointly donated Dencs and Sztup√°n, accessories to the Segesd lordship, to Theodore and Ladislaus in June 1284 (their brother Nicholas died by then). Ladislaus made Theodore as his vice- chancellor in 1286. In the next year, he was also elected provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, thus he held both offices simultaneously, which have traditionally belonged together in the previous decades. During his appointment, he was granted Iv√°ncsa by the king's spouse, Queen Elizabeth of Sicily. A single charter from 1289 also styled him as Bishop-elect of V√°c, but he was unable to take the office for unknown reasons. Crown guard and bishop It is possible that Theodore supported Archbishop Lodomer, who entered into an alliance with the rebellious K≈ëszegi family against the immoral and weak-handed Ladislaus IV and agreed to offer the crown to the king's distant relative Andrew the Venetian, who arrived to Hungary in early 1290. However Andrew was captured and surrendered him to Duke Albert. Ladislaus was assassinated by his favored Cuman subjects on 10 July 1290. Following the assassination, Lodomer managed to free Andrew from his captivity in order to crown king. As provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Theodore also functioned as guardian of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Upon Andrew's arrival, his unidentified opponents tried to bribe Theodore not to hand over the crown jewels to the soon-to-be-king, but the provost refused them. Archbishop Lodomer crowned Andrew king in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on 23 July 1290. Theodore was a staunch supporter of Andrew III throughout his reign. He retained his positions of vice-chancellor and provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r too. He was one of the main organizers of the diet, which took place in √ìbuda in the first days of September 1290, where Andrew III promised to preserve the rights and privileges of the nobility. As vice-chancellor, Theodore drafted the text of the laws. At his own request, one of the articles stated \\"the old right of the church of Feh√©rv√°r to the position of vice-chancellor to be held\\", thus officially combined the two dignities, confirming the existing customary law. The Hungarian diplomacy already began a search for a suitable spouse for their new king before his release from captivity and the coronation. After the closure of the diet, Theodore traveled to Kuyavia in the Kingdom of Poland to escort Andrew's fianc√©e Fenenna, the daughter of Ziemomys≈Ç of Kuyavia to Hungary. The wedding took place before the end of 1290. Theodore sent a large army (banderium) to Andrew's military campaign against the Duchy of Austria in the summer of 1291. Thereafter the concluded peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert of Austria had seized from the K≈ëszegis, who, in response, rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging Charles Martel of Anjou, as King of Hungary. The royal troops subdued the rebellion by July, but Ivan K≈ëszegi captured and imprisoned Andrew during his journey to Slavonia in August. Theodore arrived to the province with his army. He saved the royal property, jewels, and treasures from the robbers, and transferred them to the royal court. Alongside other lords and bishops, Theodore negotiated with the notorious Ivan K≈ëszegi over the liberation of Andrew. He was among those partisans, who sent their relatives ‚Äì his brother Ladislaus and nephews ‚Äì as hostages to the K≈ëszegis, thus Andrew was freed. As a result, they were granted Hal√°sztelek by Andrew III in January 1293. Theodore and his relatives bought B√©k√°smegyer for 120 silver denari from Ladislaus Balog, lector of Buda chapter. The family also acquired forts and towers in the nearby Margaret Island. Theodore Tengerdi was elected Bishop of Gy≈ër around April 1295. Therefore he was replaced as provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r by Gregory Bicskei still in that month, but, despite the aforementioned law, which legitimized a custom right, he retained the office of vice-chancellor until 1297, when Bicskei succeeded him in those dignity too. Theodore attended the diet in Pest in the summer of 1298, which authorized Andrew to destroy forts built without permission and ordered the punishment of those who had seized landed property with force. The Diocese of Gy≈ër, which laid in the borderlands between the expansionary K≈ëszegi and Cs√°k domains, was threatened constantly by looting and plundering raids. Ivan K≈ëszegi pillaged and unlawfully seized the bishopric's several lands in Western Transdanubia. In response, Theodore excommunicated the treacherous and greedy lord, but without any consequences and results. During his episcopate, Theodore donated privileges to the fishermen and millers of the nearby R√©vfalu (today a borough of Gy≈ër). Interregnum Andrew III died in 1301. With his death, the House of √Årp√°d, the first royal dynasty of Hungary, ended. A period of Interregnum and civil war between various claimants to the throne ‚Äì Charles of Anjou, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Otto of Bavaria ‚Äì followed Andrew's death and lasted for seven years. It is plausible that Theodore initially supported the claim of Wenceslaus, alongside the majority of the Hungarian prelates. However the arriving papal legate Niccolo Boccasini convinced most of the bishops to accept Charles's reign. Upon the invitation of Pope Boniface VIII, Theodore was a member of that Hungarian clerical delegation, which visited the Roman Curia and met the pope and Charles' grandmother Mary, Queen of Naples. Pope Boniface, who regarded Hungary as a fief of the Holy See declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31 May 1303. The Hungarian prelates, led by Stephen, Archbishop of Kalocsa traveled further to the Neapolitan court, while Theodore returned to Hungary. He already resided in Szombathely on 24 June 1303. To strengthen his son's position, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia came to Hungary at the head of a large army in May 1304. However, his negotiations with the local lords convinced him that his son's position in Hungary had dramatically weakened. Accordingly, he decided to take his son back to Bohemia and even took the Holy Crown of Hungary with himself to Prague. According to the narration of the Steirische Reimchronik (\\"Styrian Rhyming Chronicle\\"), perceiving the intrigue, Theodore Tengerdi and his small accompaniment caught up to the royal escort before crossing the border. There, the bishop asked and begged King Wenceslaus not to take the Holy Crown and the royal insignia out of the Kingdom of Hungary, but the Bohemian king replied angrily the crown is not entitled to anyone more than the rightful king who is his son, and the Holy Crown must be kept where the king resides. Theodore and his banderium participated in the invasion of Bohemia in the autumn of 1304. Theodore Tengerdi died sometimes between May and October 1308, when he was succeeded by Ivan K≈ëszegi's illegitimate son Nicholas, who was Theodore's deputy as provost of the collegiate chapter of St. Adalbert church in Gy≈ër prior to that.

Drawing inspiration from reports that Richard Sackler had stated, upon the launch of the drug Oxycontin into the market, that ‚ÄúThe prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white,‚Äù protesters dropped fake Oxycontin prescriptions into the museum rotunda before unfurling banners and staging a die-in. Banners including tests such as \\"400,000 dead\\" and \\"Take Down Their Name.\\" Fake Oxycontin prescriptions included excerpts from communication between top Purdue Pharma executives, including members of the Sackler Family, about how to increase sales of the drug and the likelihood that it would be abused. = Metropolitan Museum of Art = The Metropolitan Museum of Art was the location of P.A.I.N. protests in 2018 because its largest gallery space is named after the Sacklers. This demonstration included scattering empty prescription bottles around the Temple of Dendur in the Sackler Wing of the museum and staging a die-in. In February 2019, Nan Goldin led protesters from the Guggenheim Museum to the steps of the Metropolitan Museum to continue to put pressure on the museum. Goldin has committed to returning annually to the museum in protest until the institution divests from the Sackler Family, including removing the Sackler name from any museum spaces and declining future donations. = National Portrait Gallery = London's National Portrait Gallery declined a $1.8 million donation from the Sackler Trust towards its $65 million renovations after pressure from the art community and the public, including statements by Nan Goldin that she would not show her work there if they continued to accept support from the Sacklers. = Freer-Sackler Gallery = Nan Goldin led a group of P.A.I.N. protesters with \\"Shame on Sackler\\" banners into the Smithsonian's Freer-Sackler Galleries in April 2018 to draw attention to the support that the Smithsonian institution has received from the Sackler Family. = Louvre = On July 1, 2019, a protest led by Nan Goldin and P.A.I.N. at the Louvre Museum resulted in the removal of the Sackler family name from wall placards in the Oriental Antiquities gallery, formerly the Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities.  Impact  Purdue Pharma has responded to P.A.I.N.'s efforts with reports of an initiative on Corporate Social Responsibility, launched in March 2018. The corporation also spearheaded a PR campaign against activist Nan Goldin to discredit her criticism, before shifting their marketing focus from the United States to the developing countries. Daniel Weiss, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has revealed that the museum is reviewing policies which guide the acceptance of gifts to the museum. New York Academy of Sciences and Columbia University have also announced that they will review the philanthropic support they receive from the Sackler Family. In March 2019, major museums and galleries began to reject support from the Sackler Trust UK, including the National Portrait Gallery and Tate. Tate had previously accepted approximately ¬£4 million from Sackler Family philanthropies. Sackler Trust UK responded by halting new donations. The Louvre was the first museum, in July 2019, to remove the Sackler name from galleries as a result of protests two weeks earlier, although museum leadership refused to comment on the timing of the removal and instead cited museum policy on the duration of naming rights for funders.

It's part of the Cascade Range and is within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Mount Defiance is situated west of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff on the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. The nearest higher peak is Granite Mountain, to the east-southeast, and Bandera Mountain is to the southeast. Mount Defiance can be reached by trail, with access via the Ira Spring, Talapus Lake, or Pratt Lake trailheads. Climate Mount Defiance is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Mount Defiance and Mason Lake seen from Bandera Mountain Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Dakota Access Pipeline  On September 17, 2016 Sapiel was a speaker at a protest in Portland's Congress Square Park against the Dakota Access Pipeline that brought together Penobscot Nation members and climate activists. The protest was aimed to call on President Obama to reject a $3.8 billion proposed pipeline in South Dakota. On October 28, 2016 Sapiel's son, David Demo, was arrested for protesting the oil pipeline in North Dakota. In an interview she addressed the ongoing battle between the water rights with the state of Maine and the Penobscot people. Sapiel and other Penobscot Nation members in addition to the Bangor Social and Economic Justice Coalition prepared a candlelight vigil in Bangor, Maine as well as Portland, Maine to \\"stand in solidarity.\\" In January 2017 Sapiel helped organized a protest in Bangor, Maine outside of TD Bank demanding they withdraw funding from the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Titles  = Title I - Communications Access = Title I of the CVAA mandates that \\"advanced communications services and products\\" (including electronic messaging, VoIP, and video conferencing) be accessible to users with disabilities. Mobile web browsers must be accessible to users who are blind or visually impaired. VoIP providers must contribute to the interstate Telecommunications Relay Services Fund, while the definition of a TRS is updated to take into account scenarios such as deafblindness and communications between different types of relay users. \\"Telephone-like devices\\" designed for use with advanced communications services must have hearing aid compatibility, and the FCC received authorization to \\"ensure reliable and interoperable access to next generation 9-1-1 services by people with disabilities.\\" After multiple extensions, waivers to these rules covering communications systems in online video games lapsed after December 31, 2018. = Title II - Video Programming = Title II of the CVAA imposes accessibility requirements on television programming and streaming video. Programming that contained closed captioning when originally aired on television, or is \\"generally comparable\\" to linear television (excluding \\"consumer-generated media\\") must offer closed captioning when distributed as streaming video. The user interfaces of televisions, and set-top boxes from television providers, must offer accessibility options for the blind and visually impaired. Under the CVAA, the Federal Communications Commission has the authority to regulate the inclusion of audio description (known in the law as \\"video description\\") ‚Äî an audio track that contains narration describing key visual elements of a program for the blind and visually impaired ‚Äî in television programming. All devices capable of receiving video programming (including in addition, devices with screens less than 13 inches in size) must have the capability to support closed captioning and video description. If achievable, devices capable of recording television programming must be able to retain captioning and video description in their recordings when played back. The FCC also established the Video Programming and Emergency Access Advisory Committee (VPEAAC) in December 2010, which consists of working groups devoted to accessibility in video programming.  Video description  Effective July 1, 2012, under an FCC report and order implementing the Act, affiliates of the four major networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC) in certain media markets, and television providers with more than 50,000 subscribers, via the top 5 non-broadcast networks as determined by Nielsen ratings, are required to broadcast a minimum amount of programming containing video description per-quarter. All stations and television providers that have the technological capability to do so must be able to pass audio description tracks if provided by a programming source (with reasoning against doing so including the second audio program already being occupied by Spanish-language audio, or not having the required equipment, for instance). Broadcasters and program guides are encouraged to promote the availability of descriptions, but there is no requirement to do so. The quotas are to be gradually increased over time: it initially applied to the top 25 markets for broadcast stations, and required that 50 hours of described programming be aired per-quarter, as either \\"children's\\" (aimed towards viewers aged 16 and younger, unrelated to the Children's Television Act definition that restricts advertising load) or primetime programs. The top non-broadcast channels that must supply video descriptions are refreshed every three years, based on the previous year's ratings: upon the introduction of the rules, they were Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, TBS, TNT, and USA Network. This tally excludes channels dedicated primarily to programming aired within 24 hours of production (\\"near-live\\", which largely excludes news and sports channels that rely on live programming). The video description requirement expanded to the top 60 markets beginning July 1, 2015, and increased to 87.5 hours per-quarter effective July 2018 (but can now be scheduled any time between 6:00 a.m. and midnight, rather than only primetime or children's programming). As of the current policy, Nickelodeon and Disney Channel have since been displaced by History and HGTV on the top 5 non-broadcast channels, respectively.  Audible crawl  Under the act, broadcasters, television providers, and video programming devices must be able to convey \\"emergency information\\" in a format accessible to the blind and visually impaired. The FCC imposed this directive beginning May 26, 2015, requiring that emergency information displayed in a textual format outside of the Emergency Alert System and newscasts (such as in a news ticker displayed by the broadcaster) must be dictated on the SAP audio channel. The FCC required that non-textual information also be described in this manner, but the deadline for this mandate was delayed to May 26, 2023 after requests from the American Council of the Blind, the American Foundation for the Blind, and the National Association of Broadcasters, who assessed that technology for doing so in an automated, and non-burdening manner had not yet been developed. Also after consultation with broadcasters, the FCC removed a requirement for school closings to also be considered as \\"emergency information\\", as their intense length, coupled with a requirement for this information to be read twice, would be too unwieldy.

Plot summary The adventure is set in the World of Cypher. Thematically similar to the contemporaneous movie The Cannonball Run (1981), the player characters are participating in a five-team race held only once every seven years. To win, the characters must traverse 600 miles of wilderness, overcoming geographical obstacles, combat with the other teams, and ravenous monsters, in order to be the first to reach the City of Cypher and place a crystal orb in the crown of King Kornilian. Although spellcasting is allowed during the race, no teleportation magic can be used. Publication history Cover of second edition (1984)Catapult Run was designed by Joe Thwaites, Chris Abbott, and Ian Hartshorn, with interior art by Colin Nordel and Ken Broad, cover art by Jeff Lowe, Chris Abbott, and Colin Nordel, and cartography by Stephen Mortimer. The appendix includes weather conditions for each day of the race, pre-generated characters, and optional overland movement rules. Both editions were published by Canadian publisher Fantasy Factory in 1984. The adventure is played using the rules of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons published by TSR, Inc.. Fantasy Factory, a Canadian publisher based in Brampton, Ontario, had no connection to TSR, and its use of the AD&D; rules was unlicensed. The first sentence of the introduction to this adventure claimed \\"This is the first in a group of modules, each of which can be played on its own or as part of the series\\", but no further adventures were ever published. =First edition= The first edition (1984) is a 44-page saddle- stapled digest-sized softcover book that has a simple grey and red cover with a black & white illustration. The inside front cover has a pocket that holds a 28-page map booklet, an errata sheet and an 8-page illustration booklet. =Second edition= The second edition (also 1984) is a 32-page saddle- stapled softcover book featuring a much more professional four-colour bi-fold cover. Reception In the June 1985 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 74), Allen Varney called the writing \\"clear and professional\\", but thought the art was \\"bad or dull, or both.\\" Varney found the various encounters to be \\"complete and sometimes imaginative\\", and the new rules for drowning and overland travel \\"intelligent\\". But Varney was ambivalent about this adventure, saying, \\"I think most adventurers would want a more coherent approach. The race is a flimsy device for stringing together a batch of completely unrelated encounters.\\" He concluded, \\"Catapult Run is a respectable product, but it lacks imagination, replay value ‚Äì the race is run once every seven years ‚Äì and a useful story line. Whether it might have been improved had TSR authorized and supervised its production is problematic. Anyway, it's okay for a first effort.\\" Reviews * Abyss, Issue 36 (Winter 1985) * Alarums & Excursions, Issue 503 (September 2017) References Fantasy role-playing game adventures ","title":"Catapult Run"},{"id":"60511566","text":"Norka Rouskaya (born Delia Franciscus in 1899) was a Swiss eccentric dancer and actress.

History The Kingston Gazette was started by the partnership of Stephen Miles, Charles Kendall, and Nahum Mower. The paper has been described as the first newspaper between Montreal and Toronto (York), and for much of the War of 1812, the only paper in Upper Canada. Nahum Mower was a printer in Vermont in 1805, when a new apprentice began in his employ, Stephen Miles. Born in Royalton, Vermont on October 19, 1789, Miles accompanies Mower to Montreal in 1807, where Mower starts the Canadian Courant (Current). Three years later they arrive in Kingston, transporting their small printing press by batteau, or flat bottom riverboat, on September 13, 1810. The three begin publishing the Kingston Gazette with a prospectus in June 1810, followed by the first issue in the fall, with Mower standing for Miles since he was still not of age. Mower appears to have returned to Montreal and the Courant, being listed as an agent for the Gazette by 1818. One item of note would be that although the paper cost 15 shillings per year for subscription, the proprietors also accepted wood cords, farm produce or clean rags, the later useful in paper-making. Miles would leave the paper on April 6, 1811, travelling to Montreal, New York, then returning to Kingston on October 29. At this time Kendall had decided to return to America, and Miles had been requested to return to the paper. The request had come from one of the new owners, Richard Cartwright, who had submitted articles as requested of ‚Äúgentlemen of science and leisure.‚Äù This group of businessmen and professionals would sell the paper back to Miles on easy terms. The next few years prove eventful for Miles, serving in the War while still publishing the paper. These issues included Upper Canada's 2nd and 3rd Statutes of the 6th Parliament. He marries Laura Spaford on June 22, 1812, opening a bookstore and tri-weekly circulating library, continuing to print and publish until 1818. At this point, tired of the political climate and the harassment by Robert Gourley, Scottish land agent and anti-Family Compact advocate, he decides to sell his stake in the paper. Alexander John Pringle and John Alexander Macauley (owners of The Kingston Chronicle) purchase and rename the paper, keeping Miles on as printer until 1821. For the next seven years Miles serves as printer for the Upper Canada Herald, owned and edited by his brother-in- law. During this time Miles marries his second wife, Lucinda Daniels of Windsor on Aug 21st, 1822. In 1828 he establishes the Gazette and Religious Advocate, the first religious weekly in Upper Canada. It ran from June 20 of that year until overshadowed by Egerton Ryerson's Christian Guardian, ending on March 26, 1830. Afterwards, Miles was printer for the Canadian Watchman, a Presbyterian sheet published by Ezra S. Ely, then in 1831 he moved to Prescott, Ontario, buying and renaming the Telegraph as the Grenville Gazette, publishing from January 1832 to April 1833. Miles would sell the paper to Donald McLeod and return to Kingston and the Chronicle as foreman until 1835, when he begins the process of becoming an ordained Wesleyan Methodist preacher. He would pass away at Clark's Mills (Camden East) on December 13, 1870, his son Elijah in business as printer and proprietor of the Hastings Chronicle in Belleville. The paper continued until 1819 when it became the Kingston Chronicle under Pringle and Macauley.

Mortuary archaeology aims to generate an understanding of disease, migration, health, nutrition, gender, status, and kinship among past populations. Ultimately, these topics help to produce a picture of the daily lives of past individuals. Mortuary archaeologists draw upon the humanities, as well as social and hard sciences to have a full understanding of the individual. Mortuary archaeologists also use living groups to their advantage when studying populations that are no longer living. Mortuary archaeologists also are involved in conflict archaeology, and study mass burials from different historical events, like World War II and the Guatemalan genocide. There are different methods that contribute to mortuary archaeology including analyzing different burial techniques between and within populations and creating a biological profile of the individual(s).  Methodology  There are two main methods used by bioarchaeologists to analyze the context of a burial as well as the individual that is buried. The first type of method looks at the burial and human remains context. The next method looks at the remains in the lab to see what information can be collected from the remains. These methods help researchers understand different aspects of the culture of a group. Archaeologists using the Burial Excavation method of Mortuary Archaeology to determine what an individual from the past was like and how they lived, from their skeletal remains. = Burial Excavation = Analyzing burials helps understand the social organization of populations and the meaning behind how individuals are buried. Burial Excavation has been a source of controversy because remains are removed from their original burial in the process, and as a result it has been compared to \\"grave robbing\\". All cultures have a different way of disposing of the dead. These differences can stem from the environment that populations live in and their beliefs. One well known phrase, ‚Äúthe dead do not bury themselves,‚Äù means that the living places their ideas of the deceased as well as death on the burial practices. Some cultures have different burial practices depending on age and sex. When analyzing the burial, researchers look at: #Type of disposal #Location of disposal #Body preparations # Articulation #Deposition #Orientation #Grave goods  Disposal of the body  There are two broad categories for the disposal of the body: simple and compound disposal. A simple disposal is one inhumation at a specific point in time. Simple disposal has three different types of inhumations First, the body is placed underground or in a mound. Second, is aquatic disposal, in which the body is placed in water directly or in a craft and sent afloat. Third is a surface disposal, where the body is left on the surface to decompose naturally through the exposure of different living organisms. A compound disposal deals with two or more stages of disposal. These different stages include a variation of two of the following: exposure, burial, reburial, and cremation. There are two processes in a compound disposal. First, the reduction process, where the body decays completely before the next process. Second is the final or secondary disposal. This is the location where the individual will eventually end up permanently.  Location of Burial  The researcher takes note of where the burial is located. While Western cultures usually bury their dead in cemeteries, many ancient cultures did not have designated cemeteries. Some cultures would bury their dead in the floor of the house or in a tomb if they are of higher status. Other areas of location can be between houses, in trash areas (middens), caves, or other culturally preferred areas of disposal.  Body Preparation  The preparation of the body is looking at how the living prepared the deceased for burial. Body preparation can be embalming, being painted, or dressed in particular clothing. The researchers can analyze this as well as how the individual is buried, like in an urn or wood coffin.  Articulation  The articulation of a remains helps researchers determine how the individual was buried. A primary burial is the first and only interment of the body. This is the only time that remains should be found correctly articulated. A secondary burial is when an individual decomposes somewhere else and then is interned in their final resting spot. This can take the form of a bundle burial, where the bones first decompose and are collected before being in the ground.  Position  The position of the burial looks at the body, the head, and the arms separately. The position could help researchers say something about the populations ideas of death as well as common burial practices. There are two positions the body can be placed in. First is the extended position, where the individual is laid flat. The second is flexed, where the individual is in a fetal position. The position of the arms is suggested to be analyzed separately from the body because of intentional placement. The arms can be along the side of the body, crossed over the pelvis, folded across the chest, or have the hands over the face. The position of the head is looking at the rotation of the head around the central axis. In some cultures, it is important for the head to be facing a particular direction. These practices vary between cultures as well as time period trends.  Deposition  The deposition of the body is the ‚Äúmanner in which it has been deposited into the earth.‚Äù Through articulation, the researcher can determine if the individual was placed on the back, the face, the side, or a seated position. The extended position has two different depositions. First is supine, where the individual is on their back. Second is the prone position, where the individual is placed on their stomach face down.  Orientation  Researchers analyze the orientation of the body, grave, and disposal container. The orientation of the grave and container correlate with each other. The researcher observes the long axis of the grave and container. However, container will not be present if buried in perishable materials but could leave a stain to indicate that there was a container. The orientation of the body refers to the ‚Äúdirection in which the head lies in relation to a line between the skull and the center of the pelvis.‚Äù The orientation of the body, grave, and container can be described using degrees, cardinal directions, various subdivisions, or in relation to a natural ground feature, like a river.  Grave Goods  The grave goods that are found in context with the burial help the researcher understand a culture‚Äôs burial practices. The grave goods can be placed around, in, on the body, and in the fill around the body. Some researchers believe that the gender and status of an individual can be studied based on the grave goods placed with the individual. = Creating a Biological Profile = The remains are then analyzed in the lab to create a biological profile. The researchers look at: # Sex #Ancestry #Age #Stature #Trauma #Pathology #Taphonomy #Minimum number of individuals (MNI) The steps need to happen in chronological order because depending on the methods used, some rely on other aspects of the profile. For instance, there are age methods for specific ancestries. Many of the methods that are used by bioarchaeologists are created by forensic anthropologists. These methods can be used because there are similarities between the bones at different time periods. However, it is advised to look at methods that correlate directly to the time period and group or culture being analyzed. The techniques for each of the different aspects of the biological profile can be found in Standards: For Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains, the manual for researchers edited by Jane Buikstra and Douglas Ubelaker.  Sex  When estimating the sex of an individual, this is looking at biological sex (male or female) not gender (boy or girl). The most common elements used for sexing an individual is the skull and the pelvis, because they are the most sexually dimorphic elements. The skeletal anatomy of younger individuals does not show sexual dimorphism so they cannot be sexed. There is no definite outcome when sexing the remains because the traits will vary in each individual. For this reason, researchers us possible or probably male/female. The first researchers to look at the skull for estimating sex was Gy Acsadi and J. Nemerskeri. Philip Walker revised their method because it only looked at individuals of European descent. Walker looked at individuals from the Hamann-Todd collection as well as the Terry collection. The two collections included European, American, Native Americans, and African descent. Walker looked at five different features on the skull. Each trait is placed into a range of one (gracile) to five (robust), with individuals ranking at a three to be more indeterminate. All traits are averaged together to see if an individual is female or male. The other element that researchers have looked at is the pelvis. This element is thought to be the best indicator of sex because of the difference in childbirth. The first person to look at the pelvis was T.W. Phenice in 1969. Phenice created a nonmetric method analyzing the traits of the pelvis to obtain an outcome. In 2012, Alexandra Klales, Stephen Ousley, and Jennifer Vollner revised Phenice‚Äôs method. Klales and colleagues looked at three traits scored on a one to five scale, similar to that of the skull.  Ancestry  When estimating ancestry, most methods use nonmetric traits, or observable traits. The researcher looks at different morphological traits indicative of an ancestry. This causes more biases in the estimation. Researchers can also use metric traits from Standards and input the measurements into FORDISC to receive a result. Nonmetric traits of the crania are probably the most well known for estimating ancestry. Stanley Rhine is one of the most cited researchers for estimating ancestry using five cranial features. Even with the use of these traits, the outcome is only an estimation because of human variation. Joseph Hefner and Ousley use the same traits but score them differently. With this new scoring method, traits characteristic of American Blacks are scored at a 0 and Whites scored as 1. Once the traits are scored, they are added together. With the compiled score 3 and below means of American Black ancestry while 4 and above is White. Dental characteristics can also be used to estimate ancestry. Heather Edgar looks at the different dental characteristics that might be able to help researchers distinguish ancestry. Some of these traits are shovel-shaped incisors indicative of Asians and Native Americans and Carabelli‚Äôs cusps characteristic of European descent. The methods for estimating ancestry are scarce more work needs to be done. There also needs to be a protocol for collecting data for estimating ancestry.  Age  When aging remains, there are many different methods. However, the research first needs to see if the remains are fused or unfused before applying the different aging techniques. Individuals going through growth will have different aging methods than those of adults. There are four different aging techniques for adult individuals. These include cranial sutures, degradation of the pubic symphysis, auricular surface, and the sternal rib end of the first and fourth rib. Younger individuals age is based on tooth eruption and fusion of bone at different rates. Once the individual is aged, then they can be placed in different age categories: young adult (20‚Äì34 years), middle adult (35‚Äì49 years), and old adult (50+ years). There are two different types of methods that researchers use for aging an individual: phase and component. The phase method looks at various traits on a bone and lumps them together into a phase. These methods include the pubic symphysis and first and fourth rib. The component method looks and scores each trait individually, assuming that degradation follows a set pattern. Cranial sutures is a good example of this method. The auricular surface displays both types of methods, where the traits are placed in a phase to create a composite score to be placed in an overall phase. The method for cranial sutures was developed by Owen Lovejoy and Richard Meindl in 1985. (Lovejoy and Meindl 1985). This technique looks at the degree of closure for each cranial suture and then adds them together to get a composite score that will give an age range. This technique can be difficult when working with remains that have had cranial modification. The next technique is looking at pubic symphysis degradation. The main contributors used today are Acsadi and Nemeskeri as well as Judy Suchey and Sheilagh Brooks, both of whom created aging methods based on the pubic symphysis. The first mention of looking at this trait was made by Todd in 1920. Between these two methods, Suchey and Brooks‚Äô method is the preferred use when looking at this trait. The third trait that can be used is the auricular surface. This trait is located where the sacrum attaches to the pelvis. This technique was first introduced by Lovejoy and colleagues in 1985 (Lovejoy et al. 1985). In 2002, Buckberry and Chamberlain revised this method, updating how to place an individual into a degradation phase. Daniel Osborne, Tal Simmons, and Stephen Nawrocki in 2004 also revised the work that Lovejoy and colleagues made. Osborne and colleagues refined the number of phases down from eight to six and showed how each phase might look. The last form of aging for adults is looking at the first and fourth rib degradation. The fourth rib was the first of the two analyzed to create this method. The degradation of the fourth rib was identified by Ellis Kerley. M. Iscan, Susan Loth, and Ronald Wright in 1984, in hopes of creating a method that ages as well as the pubic symphysis. The issue with this method however, is that it was based purely on white males. Two complementary methods were created by Iscan and colleagues for studying white females and African Americans. Kunos and colleagues believe that the fourth rib is not the best to use due to misidentification in a disarticulated skeleton. Charles Kunos, Scott Simpson, Katherine Russel, and Israel Hershkovits created an aging method using the first rib. Elizabeth DiGangi, Jonathan Bethard, Erin Kimmerle, and Lyle Konigsberg revised the method and looked at two features on the rib.  Stature  The estimation of stature is only possible if there are complete long bones available There are two different techniques that can be used when estimating stature: anatomical and mathematical methods. The anatomical methods use all elements of the skeleton that contribute to height. These elements include the femur and tibia, the vertebral body heights, including the first sacral segment, talus and calcaneus, and the basion-bregma measurement of the skull. The mathematical methods, also known as the regression methods, look at the length of a single long bone or a group of bones. The mathematical methods, also known as the regression methods, look at the length of a single long bone or a group of bones. The idea of the anatomical method was first introduced by Thomas Dwight in 1894. However, in 1956, G. Fully was the first one to create and apply this type of method. In his method, Fully adds together all components that contribute to statue and a soft-tissue correction. (Fully 1965). Michelle Raxter, Benjamin Auerbach, and Christoper Ruff revised Fully‚Äôs method adding an age correction factor to the combined components and soft-tissue correction. The mathematical method was first introduced by Karl Pearson in 1899. (Pearson 1899). Mildred Trotter and Goldine Gleser created one of the earliest mathematical methods. Two different publications by Trotter and Gleser includes a sample of individuals of African American and White American males, with some Native Americans, Mexican, Puerto Rican males, and African American and White American females. Rebecca Wilson, Nicholas Hermann, and Lee Meadows Jantz revised the Trotter and Gleser methods creating new regression formulae due to secular change in heights over time. With the introduction of technology, researchers can use a statistical software called FORDISC created by Stephen Ousley and Richard Jantz to automatically calculate the stature of individuals, as well as give the best bone and bone combinations for estimating stature for that individual. When estimating stature with any of the mathematic methods ancestry and time period needs to be known to create an accurate estimation.  Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI)  The minimum number of individuals (MNI) is used to determine how many individuals were buried together, either comingled or disturbed. Keith Dobney and Kevin Rielly created a method looking at long bones divided into morphological zones. This method was introduced for looking at animal remains that are fragmented in hopes of determining how many types of animals there were in a particular area. Christopher Knusel and Alan Outram created a different method, called the zonation method in order to estimate MNI. This method divides the bone into different zones, so when the specific zone is analyzed, one can see how many zones are present in the collection to help estimate MNI.  Taphonomy and Pathology  Taphonomy was first brought on by paleontologists in the 1930s. Taphonomy is the study of biological organisms and natural affects on the bone at the time of and after death. Various taphonomic processes include termite damage, water erosion, root damage, as well as many others. There are three categories of taphonomic processes: environmental, individual, and behavioral or cultural. Environmental factors are broken down further into two different categories, abiotic (nonliving factors like sun radiation and rainfall) and biotic (living factors like rodents and roots). Individual factors are ‚Äúthe intrinsic traits that the decedent brings to the decomposition process.‚Äù These include weight, age, and sex. Behavioral or cultural factors are the affects that other humans have on the remains during burial practices. This includes the embalming process. Pathology is looking skeletal markers to understand diseases, nutrition, and the evolution of certain diseases in order to understand diseases today. The Osteological Paradox also helps researchers understand health among populations. The Osteological Paradox was introduced by James Wood in 1992 and says that there are three types of situations when it comes to pathological markers on bone. The first is that an individual was so unhealthy, that when particular disease was contracted, they die before it has a chance to leave lesions. Next you have the healthier individuals that have the disease and was able to fight it off, but not before lesions were formed. Lastly, an individual did not become sick and they died from other causes. Pathology is not only due to diseases, it can be caused by nutritional deficiencies, which are formed in the growth and development phase of bones. Some examples of nutritional pathologies are Harris lines and linear enamel hypoplasia. These form at a younger age and can also stunt the growth if the deficiency took place for a long period of time. A difficulty with studying pathology is that different diseases can cause similar lesions on the bone. However, pathologies are helpful for studying the health of individuals in a society. Donald Ortner writes extensively on different pathologies and different diseases affects on the bone.  Trauma  There are three types of trauma to keep in mind: ante-mortem, peri-mortem, and post-mortem trauma. Ante-mortem trauma is injuries to the bone before death that has evidence of healing. An example is when someone breaks their bone and it has started to heal or has healed completely. Cranial trepanation can also be considered ante-mortem trauma if there is evidence of healing, otherwise it would be considered peri-mortem trauma. Peri-mortem trauma is evidence of an injury to the bone at or around the time of death and could be the cause of death. Examples of this are a bullet wound for more contemporary cases, or an arrow wound in prehistoric cases. Post-mortem trauma is any break or taphonomy to the bone after death when the bone has dried. The researcher also looks at blunt force trauma, sharp force trauma, or ballistic trauma. Blunt force trauma is seen as the most common form of trauma. It results in abrasions, bone fractures, lacerations, or contusions. An example of this type of trauma is falling from a high elevation. Sharp force trauma is ‚Äúa narrowly focused, dynamic, slow-loaded, compressive force with a sharp object that produces damage to hard tissue in the form of an incision.‚Äù This can involve a variety of weapons or tools, like knives, that have beveled edge. Lastly, ballistic trauma is caused by projectiles.

It is part of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, and is one of four cemeteries in the complex. Since 1932 it has been part of the , which refers to it as the Necropolis of the XVIII century (). It covers 0.7 hectares. The cemetery came into existence with the establishment of the city of Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century. With the death of Peter's sister, Natalya Alexeyevna, in 1716, Peter instructed that she be buried in the grounds of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, which was under development at that time. In 1717 Natalya Alexeyevna was interred in the Church of St Lazarus, the first stone building in the monastery complex, and from which the cemetery took its name. The location soon became the burial site for other members of Peter's family and court, and became the most prestigious burial ground in the city, requiring Peter's personal permission to be interred there. The remains of Natalya Alexeyevna and other members of the imperial family were reinterred in the monastery's Annunciation Church soon after their original burial, but the church and cemetery complex remained popular sites for the St Petersburg elites, and many noble families established their family plots here. By the early nineteenth century the cemetery was becoming full, and new cemeteries were opened in the monastery complex. The last burials in the Lazarevskoe Cemetery took place in the early twentieth century, and the cemetery was closed to new burials in 1919. During the Soviet period, the cemetery became a place of interest for its elaborate funerary monuments and the graves of historically important figures. In 1932 it was declared the \\"Necropolis of the XVIII century\\" and became part of the . Graves deemed less significant were cleared away, while monuments and remains considered more artistically or historically important were moved into the cemetery from churches and burial grounds that were in the process of being demolished. Today the cemetery operates as a museum, displaying the funerary sculpture of a wide range of important artists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. History Natalya Alexeyevna, sister of Peter the Great. Her burial in 1717 marked the beginning of the cemetery complex. Burials began in 1717 when Natalya Alexeyevna, the sister of Peter the Great, was interred in the burial vault of the Church of St Lazarus, from which the cemetery took its name. During the early years of its existence it required the Emperor's permission to allow burials in the cemetery, making it the chosen location for the burial plots of St Petersburg's elite. By the end of the eighteenth century burial was extended to the wealthy merchant class, in exchange for the payment of large sums of money. The wealthy and powerful commissioned tombstones and monuments from the most prominent Russian sculptors. The cemetery includes funerary monuments by Ivan Martos, Mikhail Kozlovsky, Vasily Demut-Malinovsky, Andrey Voronikhin, Fedot Shubin, Fyodor Tolstoy and other masters. By the nineteenth century the cemetery was becoming overcrowded, and the first of the new cemeteries in the Lavra, the Tikhvin Cemetery, was opened in 1823. Burials in the Lazarevskoe Cemetery became less frequent in the nineteenth century, and in the twentieth century occurred in only exceptional cases. One of the last people to be interred was Count Sergei Witte in 1915, and in 1919 the cemetery was closed to new burials. During the Soviet period the cemetery was closed and placed under state protection, administered by the society \\"Old Petersburg\\" (). The People's Commissariat for Education proposed in the early 1920s that the cemetery become a museum displaying the sculpture of funerary monuments, a proposal that the Leningrad city administration, agreed to. Work began on studying and recording the details of the memorials, and in 1932 it was declared a museum and part of the , but remained generally closed to visitors. The head of its administration from 1932 was the historian N. V. Uspensky. A group of Soviet writers visited the cemetery in 1934, and with the support of Maxim Gorky, declared it of great cultural and historical significance. Map of the cemetery with the locations of important graves and memorials marked From 1935 Lensovet proposed that the Museum of Urban Sculpture collect the most significant pieces of memorial sculpture into the cemetery. During the 1930s the Soviet authorities \\"sought to establish a formal pantheon of dead Russian cultural heroes modelled after the national pantheon in Paris.\\" The Lazarevskoe and Tikhvin Cemeteries, as well as the Volkovo Cemetery, were designated as the sites for development. Those memorials thought to have low historical or artistic interest were cleared away, while those considered to have higher historical or artistic interest were brought from other cemeteries across the city, quite often without the remains that they commemorated. One such example is Agust√≠n de Betancourt, originally interred in the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery with a columnar monument designed by Auguste de Montferrand. Betancourt's remains and monument were transferred to the Lazarevskoe Cemetery in 1979, where the monument has undergone restoration. The remains and funerary monuments of architect Jean-Fran√ßois Thomas de Thomon and mathematician Leonhard Euler had been transferred from the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery in 1940 and 1956 respectively. During the Second World War the museum carried out inspections of the city's monuments and carried out some repair and restoration work. Large scale restoration work was carried out after the ending of the Siege of Leningrad, with the museum opening to the public in 1952. Cemetery church View of the Church of St Lazarus in 2012 The Church of St Lazarus () was built in 1717, and is located along the banks of the . Peter the Great's sister, Natalya Alexeyevna, had died in 1716, but Peter delayed her burial until his return from a journey abroad. The stone octahedral church, the first stone building of the Monastery, was built behind the Lavra's Annunciation Church, and was probably consecrated on 17 October 1717, shortly after Peter's return, and at the time of the transfer of the relics of St Lazarus. On 23 December 1718 court physician Robert Erskine was interred in the crypt, and on 26 April Peter's infant son, Tsarevich Peter Petrovich, was buried there. In 1723, the remains of Peter the Great's relatives were transferred to stone tombs in the Annunciation Church. In 1719 Peter's close associate Count Boris Sheremetev was buried in the cemetery, beginning a long association with the Sheremetev family. Other military compatriots of Peter were also interred here, including Adam Veyde and Avtonom Golovin. By the middle of the eighteenth century the Lazarevskoe Cemetery contained about 5,000 burials. The church was rebuilt and expanded between 1787 and 1789, with the addition of a small sacristy at the northern end, and refectory on the western end. Most of the funding was provided by Ivan Yelagin, a prominent figure of Catherine the Great's reign, with further funding of 1,600 rubles from Count Nikolai Sheremetev to include the grave of Borish Sheremetev and to bring the church to its present dimensions. Sheremetev, who had scandalised society by marrying Praskovia Zhemchugova, an actress and opera singer of serf origins, arranged for a lavish funeral on her death in 1803, and for requiem services in the following years. On his own death in 1809 he was interred next to her in the church. The cemetery church in 2016 Numerous other members of the Sheremetev family were interred in the vaults over the years, as were those of other important Russian noble houses. Between 1835 and 1836 the church was completely rebuilt by architect L. Ya. Tiblen at the commission of Count D. N. Sheremetev. The roof and floors were replaced, the foundations redone and the walls rebuilt to an increased height. By the completion of the work in May 1836 the church had been fundamentally redesigned, only retaining the floorplan of the original. Further repair works in 1845 and 1867 altered the iconostasis and renewed the paintings. Burials continued to take place in the church vaults, with the last being Ekaterina Vasilyevna Dashkova, the widow of the writer and statesman of the Arzamas Society , in 1890. Viktor Kochubey, one of a number of public figures whose remains and monuments were reinterred in the church during the Soviet period The church was closed with the rest of the cemetery in 1923, and for a time served as a warehouse for storing monuments and gravestones brought from other cemeteries that were being demolished. With the establishment of the necropolis museum in 1932, the church interior was heavily remodelled. The iconostasis was dismantled and the walls and ceiling were painted over. Most of the icons were removed, though many of the historical monuments were retained. With the demolition of the Lavra's Dukhovskaya Church in 1937, a number of monuments were transferred to the museum, and over the next few years the remains of several famous historical figures were transferred and interred in the Church of St Lazarus, including; Prince Ioane of Georgia, Viktor Kochubey and Ekaterina Ilyinichna Kutuzova, the wife of Mikhail Kutuzov. Other monuments were brought from the Feodorovskaya Lavra Church, the Smolensky Armenian Church and the Catholic Church in Tsarskoye Selo. The remains of Count , the father-in-law of Decembrist Prince Sergei Petrovich Trubetskoy were reburied in the church, but his monument was never installed. The church was damaged several times during the siege of Leningrad, with repair work beginning in 1944. It reopened several years later, and serves as an exhibition hall for funerary monuments of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Eighty-two monuments are now located in the Church of St Lazarus, thirty-three of which have been brought from other locations. Burials The grave of Leonhard Euler, transferred from its original location in the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery in 1956 Many of the early burials were those of the associates of Peter the Great. These included military figures such as Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev and General Adam Veyde, and the Court Physician Robert Erskine. The cemetery's exclusivity made it a desirable burial site, and many of the leading figures and families of St Petersburg acquired plots. Among them were the academics Mikhail Lomonosov and Stepan Krasheninnikov; playwrights Denis Fonvizin and Yakov Knyazhnin; architects Ivan Starov, and Andrey Voronikhin; statesmen and politicians Alexander Stroganov, Nikolay Mordvinov, Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky and Sergei Witte; and military officers such as Vasily Chichagov. The family vaults of the Beloselsky-Belozersky, Trubetskoy, Volkonsky and Naryshkin ancient noble houses were located here, as were those of some of the prominent merchant dynasties such as the Demidovs and Yakovlevs. Art historian wrote \\"It was as if all those who had once formed a close circle of court society gathered here after death. A whole epoch, a whole world of obsolete ideas, almost all the court society of Elizabeth, Catherine and Paul were buried in the small space of the Lazarevskoe cemetery\\". The remains and monuments of Jean-Fran√ßois Thomas de Thomon, mathematician Leonhard Euler and engineer Agust√≠n de Betancourt, all originally interred in the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery, were transferred to the Lazarevskoe Cemetery in 1940, 1956 and 1979 respectively.

She specialized in miniature portraits on ivory, though her \\"miniatures\\" tended to be larger than average.  Early life  Mira Edgerly was born on January 18, in Aurora, Illinois, to Rosa Haskell and Samuel Haven Edgerly. Her father was the director of the Michigan Central Railroad. The family moved to Jackson, Mississippi and then to Detroit, where Edgerly attended The Liggett School. Around 1892, Edgerly moved with her mother and sisters to San Francisco. Following the death of her father, Edgerly needed to find work to help support her impoverished family. Inspired by a magazine article about American miniature portrait painter Amalia K√ºssner Coudert, Edgerly began teaching herself to paint miniatures on ivory.  Mid-life and career  = Pre-World War I = Edgerly moved to New York around 1900, continuing her self-taught portraiture practice in a studio on 35th Street. According to writer Burges Johnson, Edgerly quickly gained access to the upper-class New York social scene. She also traveled to London at the invitation of Mrs. Patrick Campbell, where she began painting commissioned portraits of \\"the pre-World War I 'privileged classes.'\\" Edgerly became friends with portrait photographer Arnold Genthe and posed for him. The two had a \\"mutually inspiring friendship,\\" and discussed portraiture, arrangements, and composition. Between 1905 and 1914 Edgerly also had a studio in Paris. There she was encouraged in her work by John Singer Sargent, who appreciated the unusually large size of Edgerly's ivory miniatures. She also became friends with Gertrude Stein, who wrote about her as \\"Myra Edgerly\\" in The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas: Mira Edgerly-Korzybska secured the funds for Mildred Aldrich to move into this house, where she wrote her best-seller, A Hilltop on the Marne (1915) > Mildred Aldrich once brought a very extraordinary person Myra Edgerly. I > remembered very well that when I was quite young and went to a fancy-dress > ball, a Mardi Gras ball in San Francisco, I saw a very tall and very > beautiful and very brilliant woman there. This was Myra Edgerly young. > Genthe, the well known photographer did endless photographs of her, mostly > with a cat. She had come to London as a miniaturist and she had had one of > those phenomenal successes that americans do have in Europe. She had > miniatured everybody, and the royal family, and she had maintained her > earnest gay careless outspoken San Francisco way through it all. She now > came to Paris to study a little. She met Mildred Aldrich and became very > devoted to her. Indeed it was Myra who in nineteen thirteen, when Mildred's > earning capacity was rapidly dwindling secured an annuity for her and made > it possible for Mildred to retire to the Hilltop on the Marne. Myra Edgerly > was very earnestly anxious that Gertrude Stein's work should be more widely > known. When Mildred told her about all those unpublished manuscripts Myra > said something must be done. And of course something was done. She knew John > Lane slightly and she said Gertrude Stein and I must go to London. But first > Myra must write letters and then I must write letters to everybody for > Gertrude Stein. She told me the formula I must employ. I remember it began, > Miss Gertrude Stein as you may or may not know, is, and then you went on and > said everything you had to say. In late 1913 or early 1914, Edgerly traveled to Ottawa, where she painted the portrait of Princess Patricia of Connaught. On February 1, 1914 she married Frederick Burt. The marriage lasted only a few months. = World War I and after = In August of 1914, Edgerly returned to the United States, where she continued painting portraits commissioned by wealthy society members. She had an exhibition at the women-only Colony Club in New York in 1915. According to a story from the United States Department of Labor, Edgerly also volunteered as a farmhand in Westville, Indiana during this time. Edgerly also visited in Washington, D.C., where she met Count Alfred de Skarbek Korzybski, at the time a Polish soldier. On January 17, 1919, the two married, making Edgerly the Countess de Korzybska. In the years that followed, Edgerly-Korzybska continued to paint, while also helping Alfred develop the theories that would lead to his creation of general semantics. In his 1921 book, Manhood of Humanity, Alfred thanked her for \\"her steady and relentless work and her time, which saved my time.\\" The Art Institute of Chicago holds a 1922 painting by Edgerly- Korzybska titled The Time-Binder, a reference to Alfred's theory of time- binding, which he would first present at the International Mathematical Congress in 1924. From 1927 to 1933, the Korzybskis lived in Brooklyn and prepared Alfred's Science and Sanity for publication. Beginning in 1937, Edgerly-Korzybska spent two years in South America, traveling and painting. She then moved to Chicago, where the Institute of General Semantics was located.  Later life and death  From 1943, Edgerly-Korzybska experienced arthritis which prevented her from painting. Around this same time, she began studying anthropology at the University of Chicago, and worked on writing an autobiography, which was never published. Mira Edgerly-Korzybska died on July 13, . She was cremated and buried next to her husband in Lime Rock, Connecticut.

E-mail interview. 26 Apr. 2019.  History  The Independent was founded by James J. Mackin, President; Bridget LeRoy, Vice President; Lee Minetree, Treasurer; and Jodi Della Femina, Secretary. The first issue (vol.1, no.1) of the newspaper was released on September 1st, 1993. The paper, originally named The East Hampton Independent, was renamed The Independent when they expanded to cover the entire East End. The paper is owned by East Hampton Media, previously known as The East Hampton Independent News Co. In 2005, the Independent acquired the Traveler Watchman. The Traveler Watchman is a newspaper from North Fork, Long Island, dating back to the 1800s. Ultimately, Jerry Della Femia became a partner and was the majority owner of the paper until 2017. Jerry Della Femina is the father of daughter and co-founder of The Independent, Jodi Della Femina. On Wednesday April 19, 2017, the paper was sold to billionaire investor Ronald O. Perelman. Perelman, a resident of East Hampton himself, wanted to support and generously fund the paper's initial mission. In an article for Patch East Hampton he stated \\"As the paper's new owner, I am absolutely committed to supporting The Independent's mission with a continued focus on covering local news and events while enhancing and expanding the paper's focus and coverage of the vibrant local arts, culture, dining, social scene and real estate.\\"  Coverage  Every Wednesday, The Independent publishes coverage of local news and events on the entire East End. The print version of the paper is divided into several sections. In addition to the expected sections such as news & opinion, it includes several unique sections such as Indy Style which discusses latest trends, store openings and designers and Indy Snaps which highlights photography from all aspects of East End life. The website is divided into five sections, news & opinion, arts, real estate, sports & health and the 2019 camps guide. The categories are then further divided into subsections encompassing the most important parts of each section. For example, the news & opinion header is separated into six sections, such as police and obituary. Within the sports section & health section of the paper, there is an entire subdivision focused on high school sports within the town. While The Independent covers all high school sports teams on the East End, they often cover sports within Pierson Middle-High School. One unique section of the newspaper that runs in the spring and summer months is the 2019 Camps Guide. The Camps Guide describes children's summer camps throughout the New York Area such as Future Stars Camp and the Art Farm. The article contains a directory of camps with extensive summaries in addition to providing links and contact information for each camp. In addition to the paper's online presence,The Independent has an online archive section of 767 copies online going back more than ten years.  Merger and sale  On June 9, 2020, The Independent announced that it would be merging with competitor Dan's Papers to form a new media entity, Dan's Independent Media. While the merger was attributable partly due to falling advertising sales at the two publications as a result of COVID-19, discussions regarding the merger reportedly began in February of 2020, prior to the major economic effects of the Coronavirus recession. After the merger, The Independent became online- only In September 2020, Dan's Independent Media was acquired by Schneps Media.  Awards  At the 2018 New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest Awards held in Albany, NY, The Independent won 21 awards. It won five first- place awards and nearly a dozen other awards; it additionally was awarded six honorable mentions. The most prestigious award in the design category of the better newspaper contest is the Richard L. Stein Award for Overall Design Excellence. Although The Independent didn't receive this award, they received a significant honorable mention for the overall design and appearance of the entry provided. In addition to awards for individual contributors as well as presentation and design, editors Jessica Mackin-Cipro and Bridget LeRoy received awards for their writing. * 1st Place, Editorial Award, Jessica Mackin-Cipro and Bridget LeRoy, (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 1st Place, Best News Story ‚ÄúDeportations Of Those Convicted Of Crimes Ramp Up.‚Äù Award (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 1st Place, Best Editorial Cartoon, Karen Fredericks \\"Is it Just Me?\\" (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 1st Place, Photography, Karen Fredericks \\"Is it Just Me?\\" (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 1st Place, Best Spot News Photo, Michael Heller \\"Is it Just Me?\\" (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 1st Place, Best Sports Action Photo, Peggy Spellman Hoey\\"Is it Just Me?\\" (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 2nd Place, Best Large Space Ad, Ty Wenzel (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 2nd Place, Best Online Dynamic Ad, Ty Wenzel (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 2nd Place, Best Obituaries, Ty Wenzel (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 2nd Place, Best Large Space Ad, Bridget LeRoy and Jessica Mackin-Cipro (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 2nd Place, Picture Store, Ed Gifford (2018) - New York Press Association Better Newspaper Contest * 3rd Place, Sports Action Photos, Gordon M.

Katebi works with publishers to provide free ebooks of each reading, and ends each unit with a global conversation on Youtube Live with different guests. Past guests have included Naomi Klein and Arundhati Roy. Katebi's #BecauseWeveRead has been featured in media outlets including Dazed Magazine and Refinery29.  Clothing co- operative and garment labor activism  = Blue Tin Production = Katebi supports ethical fashion and advocates for the abolition of fast fashion. She argues that fast fashion subjects garment workers to \\"systemic gender-based violence\\" including sexual and verbal abuse by their employers as well as dangerous working conditions in sweatshops. In early 2019, Katebi launched a clothing co-operative, Blue Tin Production, which is run by refugee and immigrant women and promotes ethical garment production and is the first of its kind in the United States. In an interview with Vogue, Katebi stated \\"her overall goal is to offer designers in the U.S.‚Äîand abroad‚Äîa no-brainer alternative to sweatshops with ‚Äúradical transparent production.‚Äù In December 2019 Blue Tin Production published its first annual report. Katebi's activism and Blue Tin Production has garnered attention from international fashion and journalism outlets, including Vogue, The Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, The Guardian, and Medium. = 'Revolution-Washing' = In 2017 Katebi coined the term 'Revolution Washing' which has since been used to describe the ways in which fast-fashion brands attempt to brand themselves as progressive to appeal to conscious consumers while simultaneously exploiting garment workers to produce their apparel. In August 2019 Katebi went on a delegation to Indonesia to meet with garment workers working in Nike, H&M;, GAP, and other fast-fashion sweatshops. = Acknowledgements and awards = * The Pioneer Award given by the Chicago Foundation for Women * 20 In Their 20s by Crain's magazine  References  Writers from Chicago American women bloggers American bloggers Iranian emigrants to the United States American writers of Iranian descent American fashion businesspeople Writers from Oklahoma ","title":"Hoda Katebi"},{"id":"60512147","text":"Leslie George Snow (1907-1995) was an English athlete.

Original series =Main characters= ; : :The protagonist of the series, Itami is a 33-year-old otaku and JSDF soldier. After successfully escorting hundreds of citizens to safety during the attack on Ginza, Itami is promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and tasked to investigate the world on the other side of the Gate. He is a certified JSDF Ranger and Special Forces trooper (although this only occurred due to his superiors' futile attempts to discipline him), and while he is notable for being a slacker and a fast runner from trouble, he is honest and compassionate and can be quite capable when under stress. He is also later rendered immune from bodily harm due to a contract Rory Mercury makes with him, in exchange for him becoming her servant upon his death. With his heroic acts during the battle of Ginza and in the world beyond the Gate, he also becomes a role model for his fellow JSDF soldiers and his friends in Alnus Town. :Itami's family name is derived from the city of Itami in the Hy≈çgo Prefecture, where the JGSDF Central Army headquarters is located. ; : :A 19-year-old princess from the Empire that rules the other world. Born to an Imperial concubine, and 10th (3rd in the anime) in the line of succession to the throne, Pi√±a Co Lada is dedicated to the Empire's welfare. Idealistic but inexperienced, she has at first trouble dealing with the realities of political life, but matures during the course of the series. After seeing the JSDF's military power in action, she wishes to establish peace with Japan, as she knows that a war with them will eventually lead to the Empire's ultimate destruction. During her first visit to Japan to meet with several officials, Pi√±a develops an obsession with yaoi d≈çjinshi and later has her Rose Knights translate more of them for her to read. After being rescued from Zorzal's clutches, Pi√±a is appointed Crown Princess by Emperor Molt and ends up falling in love with Itami. Oddly, her name is taken from the rum-based cocktail Pi√±a colada. ; : :Tuka is a 165-year-old High Elf, an adolescent by her race's standards. She loses her father who sacrifices himself to save her when her village is attacked by a Flame Dragon, and since then travels with Itami and co. However, she has a hard time coping with her father's death, and eventually begins to lapse into insanity, starting to view Itami as her lost father. But even after overcoming her loss with Itami's help, she keeps calling him \\"father\\" both out of habit and out of bashfulness about her budding true feelings for him. She has also entertained a temporary crush on Mari Kurokawa. ; : :A 15-year-old witch from the other world, a former member of the Rurudo nomad tribe, and a student to an elderly sorcerer who is notable for her platinum-blonde hair and perpetually emotionless expression. She considers herself legally married to Itami after the latter unwittingly fulfilled an ancient wedding custom, which involves a couple spending three consecutive nights in the same room. Brilliant and inquisitive, Lelei quickly learns the Japanese language and becomes the interpreter/translator for Itami's party. Thanks to the knowledge of physics acquired during her visits to Earth, combined with her natural magical abilities and a gift from the underworld goddess Hardy, she eventually becomes capable of opening a Gate between the Special Region and Japan at will. ; : :A 961-year-old demigoddess and the Apostle of the god Emroy. She's usually dressed in her formal apostle wear, which strongly resembles gothic lolita fashion. Rory's status as a demigoddess entails that she cannot die and can recover from any wound; upon her 1,000th birthday, she will ascend and become a full goddess. She's superhumanly strong, which allows her to wield her extremely heavy signature halberd with ease, and very fast and agile, with centuries of combat experience. Her presence and status as an Apostle are also a great help to Itami's group in establishing social relations within the Special Region. Her only major weakness is her fear of going underground, due to her dislike for Hardy, who desires Rory as her bride. After meeting Itami, she takes a particular interest in him because of his sincerity, and owing to this affection, she later elects to become the Goddess of Love upon her ascension. ; : :A Dark Elf who is over 300 years old; her middle name is a reference to the underworld goddess Hardy, who is worshipped by her people. She seeks the JSDF's aid when the same dragon that attacked Tuka's village moves to the forest where her tribe lives, becoming a threat to them. After the dragon is vanquished, and after learning that the Apostle of Hardy was responsible for its rampage, she renounces her faith in Hardy, changes her name to (with \\"Ro\\" in reverence of Rory Mercury, who came to the aid of her people) and offers herself to Itami as a slave. Unlike the other three girls in Itami's company, she isn't as relentless in pursuing his affections, but she is just as perplexed about his seemingly indifferent attitude about their relationship, especially since her penchant for bad luck keeps her self-esteem low and she regards Itami as a pillar of support. =Japanese characters= Third Recon Unit While the Recon Unit encompasses a total of eleven members, the characters listed here are those who gain special prominence in the story. ; : : A petite but buxom Sergeant First Class of the Third Recon Unit under Itami, she does not hold him in high regard due to his otaku nature. She idolizes the Japanese Ranger and Special Forces; a perception which is somewhat disillusioned when she learns that Itami is a certified member of both. She excels in hand-to-hand combat and prefers charging head-first into a battle to take on her opponents with just her rifle-mounted bayonet. She remains in the Special Region when the Gate is closed, because the new world presents her with a chance to cut loose with her combative nature and because she has fallen in love with her teammate Tomita, despite him being already involved with Bozes of the Rose Knights. ; : : Sergeant First Class Tomita, a 27-year- old trained Ranger, is the gentle giant of the unit who is a solemn but kind man and often acts as the voice of reason within the group. He and Bozes enter a relationship, and as a result he is one of the JSDF servicemen remaining in the Special Region when the Gate is closed. ; : : A 21-year-old sergeant in the JSDF and driver on the recon team, he is also an otaku like Itami, with a special fetish for catgirls. His geeky fantasy becomes reality when he meets Persia, a housemaid of the Formal Clan who happens to be half-cat. The two become close very quickly and are nearly inseparable whenever Kurata visits Italica. Owing to this affection, Kuruta is one of the JSDF servicemen who voluntarily stays in the Special Region when the original Gate is shut down. ; : : The medic of the Third Recon Team with the rank of Sergeant First Class, at 190cm she is an (for a Japanese) unusually tall woman. Her father is a submarine commander in the Japanese Navy force. She can be uncomfortably sharp-tongued in her opinions at times, especially to Itami if she suspects he has ulterior motives related to his otaku hobbies. While she cares for the well-being of those under her supervision, especially civilians, she can be very vicious with disobedient patients, often using sadistic-looking means of intimidation to discipline them. At the end of the series, she has returned to Earth and become head nurse of the JSDF Central Hospital. ; : : A fifty-year- old Sergeant Major who serves as Itami's second in command. As the oldest member in the unit, he has experience and wisdom of training and leading recruits on the field. He replaces Itami as team leader after the latter runs off to kill the Fire Dragon on his own and is consequently relieved of his command. After the original Gate has closed, he retires from the SDF and works at a security firm while spending time with his newly-born grandchildren. ; : : A leading private in the Third Recon Team who used to work in his family's first-class restaurant until he got into an argument with the new management, and joined the JSDF to gather the funds to open his own restaurant. During the team's mission in the Imperial Capital, he goes undercover as a chef after his cooking gets the interest of Prince Zorzal. There he falls in love with Tyuule, Zorzal's Warrior Bunny concubine and secret adversary; they end up aiding each other in thwarting the tyrannical prince, and after Tyuule's death and the closure of the Gate, he and Delilah open a restaurant in Tokyo in her memory. JSDF Special Region Task Force ; : : A JSDF Lieutenant General in charge of the JSDF task force within the Special Region who holds Itami in high regard despite the latter's reckless attitude. As a responsible commander, he is one of the JSDF servicemen who stays behind when the Gate is shut down. ; : : A First Lieutenant who serves as General Hazama's aide. He dislikes Itami due to the latter gaining his rank due to the Ginza Incident, whereas he had to earn it by hard work himself. Unlike Itami, who cares about the people of the Special Region and wants to help them, Yanagida sees no problem in manipulating and exploiting the Special Region's people and resources for Japan's gain. He eventually develops a grudging respect for Itami despite the fact that the two seem to antagonize each other over minor details, especially regarding Itami's nonchalant attitude and his ability to gain allies so easily. ; : :A major in the Special Region Task Force and Itami's immediate superior, who is usually frustrated by Itami's lax attitude violating military protocol. ; : :A JSDF colonel and commander of the Special Region Task Force's 4th Combat Unit, an air assault company, and a veteran of Italica and the evacuation of the Jade Palace. Despite their age difference and language barrier, he begins a relationship with Rose Knight Beefeater E Caty, and is one of the servicemen remaining in the Special Region after the Gate's collapse. ; : :A colonel and the commander of the 1st Task Force Combat Unit, a mixed infantry corps. ; : :A somewhat hot-blooded lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Air Force, and the leader of the JASDF branch of the Task Force, flying a F4 Phantom. He stays in the Special Region upon the Gate's closure because of the lack of flying restrictions in that world, and because of his romantic attentions towards the Rose Knights. ; : :A major and chief of the JSDF detachment stationed in Akusho, the Imperial Capital's red-light district. Japanese government and citizens ; : :The Japanese Minister of Defense and Itami's old friend. Like Itami, he is also an otaku. Strong- willed and patriotic, he succeeds Prime Minister Morita as an interim candidate after he and the other Cabinet members expose Morita's cowardice in intending to surrender administration of the Gate to a foreign international conspiracy instead of defending his nation's sovereignty. At the end of the series, he has retired from politics and thus become free to pursue his otaku passions once more. ; : :Itami's ex-wife and a yaoi doujin artist whose hobby of collecting dolls leave her broke quite frequently. Having been former classmates in college, she and Itami married for convenience: Itami provided money for Risa's hobby and Risa looked after the household for Itami. Risa divorced Itami after she tried to convince Itami not to go to the Special Region and realized that he never really loved her. Nevertheless, they still care about each other, with Itami still providing financial support to Risa. Risa still loves Itami, even though she knows he'll never realize it on his own. After encountering Pi√±a, she becomes the princess' main source for doujin mangas. ; : :One of several Japanese civilians who were captured by Imperial Scouts prior to the Ginza Incident. She was taken to the Imperial capital, where she became Prince Zorzal's sex slave. When the Japanese learn of Noriko's existence, the JSDF rescues her and warns the Empire there will be consequences if all other Japanese slaves are not repatriated. Despite her traumatic experience and the loss of her entire family during the Ginza Incident, she returns to Alnus to act as a liaison between the locals and the Japanese media. After witnessing the callous sensationalist pursuits of the Japanese media in the Special Region (especially as personified by Kazunari Komurazaki), she begins to crusade against this bias, determined to serve only the truth to the Japanese public. ; : :Shino's younger sister and a rookie newscaster. After she finds out that the news concerning the Special Region are censored by elements in the Japanese government looking out for their own interests instead of the public's, she dedicates herself to relaying tellings of the true events in the other world and root out the corruption in the Japanese media. After the closure of the Gate, she establishes a popular online news studio. ; : :A Ministry of Foreign Affairs official who is sent to the Special Region as an ambassador to the Empire as part of a delegation to convince the Empire to seek peace with Japan. When he meets Sherry Tyueri and she falls in love with him, he is quite awkward about her affection for him considering her tender age, but genuinely cares about her. When Zorzal takes over the throne and his Oprichnina arrests members of the nobility who seek peace with Japan, he saves Sherry by declaring that she is his fianc√©. Before the Gate is closed, he decides to remain in the Special Region to maintain the diplomatic ties between Japan and the Empire. ; : :The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in charge of the Special Region. ; : :A leading member of the Japanese Defense Intelligence Headquarters and later of the Public Security Division, who acts as a guide and head of personal security during the official visits of Itami's troupe in Japan. Later he proves instrumental in deposing Prime Minister Morita for conspiracy against Japan's national interests and installing Minister Kan≈ç as an interim candidate in his place. ; : :An extremely arrogant, superficial Japanese journalist who constantly tries to score negative press about the JSDF in the Special Region solely for publicity's sake. His selfishness and recklessness endanger and even cause the death of some of his support personnel in his sensationalist pursuits, making him very unpopular with the Japanese on-site. =Special Region characters= The Empire The Empire has at the time of the JSDF's arrival remained the dominant political domain in the Special Region for over 687 years. Its political, cultural and military systems are patterned after those of the ancient Roman Empire. Humans form the primary social class; demihumans are by Imperial law considered non-citizens. ; : :First Prince of the Empire, Pi√±a's eldest half-brother, and the main antagonist of the series. Mentally unstable, arrogant and vain, yet cunning enough to play the role of a foolish upstart (for his father to believe that he could be easily used as a proxy once he retires), Zorzal is a sadist who enjoys committing rape, murder and genocide, and owns a number of sex slaves. After Itami frees his Japanese prisoner Noriko from his clutches, Zorzal swears revenge, installs himself as the new Emperor, and attempts to wage a new war against Japan, heedless of the JSDF's technological superiority. In the end, after a reckless all-out attack on Pi√±a before the gates of Italica, he loses all and is killed by Tyuule, although he succeeds in taking her with him. ; : :Zorzal's sex slave and the former Queen of the Warrior Bunny Tribe. Her tribe was at war with the Empire, but realizing they could not win, she gave herself up to Prince Zorzal as his slave in exchange for him sparing her tribe. However, Zorzal did not keep his word and brutally slaughtered and enslaved her people while lying to the survivors that Tyuule sold them out to save herself, which gained her her tribe's hatred. Upon learning the truth, Tyuule swore revenge to bring down the Empire by appearing submissive to Zorzal while secretly manipulating him into waging a suicidal war with Japan that would bring the Empire to complete ruin. She falls in love with Furuta Hitoshi, but in the end cannot let go of her vengeance against Zorzal, and when she is found out, she and the prince end up killing each other. ; : :The Special Region's ruthlessly pragmatical Emperor and Pi√±a's father. Despite knowing that the Japanese forces far outclass the Empire's, he is initially reluctant to seek peace with them, fearing that they might be truly unstoppable should he give them time to establish a foothold. After being rescued from Zorzal's clutches, and after realizing that the JSDF are his best hope for preserving the Empire, he allies himself with them and appoints Pi√±a as his rightful successor. ; : :The king of Elbe Kingdom, Duran was part of the second wave of forces sent by the Empire to recapture Alnus hill from the JSDF \\"invaders\\". His forces were annihilated, and when Princess Pi√±a found him, he was a crippled shell of a man waiting for his death, either from the Empire or his own people. Later on, he secretly poses as a disabled refugee at Alnus and is rehabilitated by the JSDF with prosthetic limbs and medical treatment. He later serves as a pivotal person in allowing the JSDF to cross the Elbe kingdom and help Itami defeat the Fire Dragon, and as a member of the pro-Imperial coalition against Zorzal. ; : :A former founding member of the Order of the Rose Knights, who after leaving the group became a viscount. He participated in and was captured during the Imperial attack on Ginza, and seeking to repay Japan for his humiliation, he becomes one of Zorzal's military advisors during the Imperial civil war. His main ambition is to prove himself Pi√±a's better, a prospect in which he fails when he is unceremoniously captured after the Second Battle of Italica. ; : :The ambitious but cowardly younger brother of Zorzal who seeks the throne despite not being next in the line of succession. When Zorzal takes over, he flees to Alnus in order to enlist a foreign power in aiding his ascension, resulting in him entering a deal with the Chinese government to make him the Emperor in return for delivering Lelei to them. However, after the Chinese betray him, Rory Mercury appoints him as the nominal \\"puppet\\" governor of the Alnus Living Community to satisfy his ambitions. ; : :Sherry is the 12-year-old daughter of the Tyueri family, a noble family related to Marquess Casel, an influential senator. Wanting to improve his connections to Casel, Sugawara offered to have a pearl necklace delivered to Sherry following their meeting at a party. Following this, Sherry fell in love with Sugawara, and attempted to pursue him whenever he was near. She quickly demonstrates a wisdom and maturity beyond her years, showing a keen understanding of the awkward interactions between Japan and the people of the Empire, as well as the problems this would pose to Japan and her \\"future husband\\"; for this reason, she eagerly offers to aid Sugawara and help bridge the gap between their nations. After her parents' death during Zorzal's purge of the Imperial pro-peace factions, Marquess Casel adopts Sherry as his ward, and Emperor Molt later appoints her as his emissary in Japan, a role which she fulfills with uncanny capability. When the Gate is closed, she moves in with Sugawara's family to await the reunion of the two worlds. ; : :The Empire's Minister of Internal Affairs, and chief adviser and right hand of Emperor Molt Augustus. In some translations his name is spelled \\"Marx\\". Order of the Rose Knights The Order of the Rose Knights, founded and led by Imperial Princess Pi√±a Co Lada, consists of a predominantly female group of noble women from the Empire. Originally, they served as color guard and \\"decorative\\" pieces for the Empire's Army and were never used in battle. Their first actual battle came at the Siege of Italica, where rogue Allied Soldiers became marauders and attacked the merchant city, an event where the Knights demonstrated their skills and loyalty to the Empire and their princess. ; : :A commoner by birth and a veteran Imperial knight assigned under Princess Pi√±a who also served as the Rose Knights' mentor and combat instructor. ; : :Princess Pi√±a's page, who is two years her junior. She was part of Princess Pina's group during the Siege of Italica and assisted Pi√±a in making a treaty with the JDSF. After her own interaction with the JDSF, she feels reliable, dependable, and trustful towards the actions and words of Itami and his 3rd Recon Team. ; : :Second daughter of Marquis Palesti, and second in command of Princess Pi√±a's order of Knights; given the title of the Gold Rose. She develops mutually shared feelings for Tomita, formalizes a forbidden relationship with him and becomes pregnant with his child, Mai. ; : :A member of the Order, as well as a close friend of Princess Pi√±a. Her later love affair with Pi√±a's brother Diabo makes her both his reluctant accomplice and a moderating influence in his own ascension plans. ; : :A captain of the Rose Knights and one of Princess Pi√±a's oldest acquaintances. She later enters into a relationship with Colonel Kengun of the 401st Company, who led the Jade Palace rescue. It wasn't clear if author Takumi Yanai based her character name \\"Beefeater\\" on the Yeoman Warders, who are also called \\"Beefeaters\\", or on a popular Gin brand that also goes by the same name. ; : :A young Imperial noble who is part of the Order of the Rose Knights. Shandy has a weakness for famous people, and tends to romanticize owing to her enthusiasm. She is the one who originally reports the Flame Dragon's defeat to the Empire, and later assists Itami and his group guarding Leilei from assassins during her Master Exam. During the Imperial civil war, she is killed in the Second Battle of Italica after being overwhelmed by the Haryo tribe members while defending Emperor Molt. Clan Formal Clan Formal is a neutral clan that resides in the city of Italica, an important agricultural town. The former patriarch was Count Colt Formal, a nobleman who took in many poor residents and humanoids as servants and as a personal \\"hobby\\". The maids are also skilled in combat in case the household is threatened. With the founding of the Alnus settlement, several of the Formal household servants move there to aid the JSDF as public workers (shopkeepers, barmaids, etc.). After the failure of Zorzal's coup d'etat and the rescue of Princess Pi√±a and Emperor Molt, Italica becomes the temporary seat of the legitimate Imperial government. ; :The third and (at 11 years) youngest daughter of Colt Formal and his wife, who perished in an accident, and his heir and nominal leader of the Formal household. ; : :The de facto guardian of Countess Myui and head of the female household servants. While she dislikes the Empire because it subjugated her homeland by force, she is a gracious host and trustworthy ally. Her primary interest is the protection of the Countess, though, which initially drives her into employing her household servants as spies against the JSDF in order to discern their ultimate motives. ; : :A Warrior Bunny maid and spy for Clan Formal at the Alnus Community. A proud warrior of her people, she refused to subjugate herself to slavery after Zorzal captured her queen Tyuule, whom she wants to kill due to Zorzal's lies. She and other fugitives from her people were eventually taken in by Count Formal. After she is tricked by Tyuule, Bouro and a traitor within House Formal into attempting to murder Noriko, she opens a relationship with Akira Yanagida and joins the Japanese Special Forces in their forays against Zorzal's forces during the Imperial civil war. After the war's conclusion, she moves to Japan before the Gate's closure and together with Furuta opens a restaurant dedicated to Tyuule's memory. ; : :A young catgirl maid from House Formal who has taken up work at the Alnus settlement's PX shop. ; : :A pince-nez-wearing catgirl maid who becomes romantically involved with Kurata. ; : :A Warrior Bunny maid. ; : :A Medusa maid at House Formal. Unlike her mythological template, she is very pretty and does not turn people to stone, but rather drains their life energy and memories. She was hired by the late Count to ease the passing of dying house members into the afterlife. Deities The Special Region is home to several deities - both full-fledged gods and demigods - who act as guardians against undesired developments amongst the other world's people, either by sponsoring those who promote the natural balance or by eradicating any elements which threaten it. Demigods, also called Apostles, are first selected from among mortal beings with great potential; they maintain a physical form, but remain eternally young and alive even after suffering dismemberment, until they become spiritual beings and ascend to godhood upon their 1,000th year. These newly ascended gods are free to claim one of the domains held by the deity they served, or any aspect not yet claimed by another deity, or become a specific region's divine patron. Many denizens of the Special Region base their middle names on the name of the deity they personally worship. ; :The Goddess of the Underworld in the Special Region, whose main temple is located in the city of Belnago. The uniforms of her priestesses are similar to Rory Mercury's clothes in a lolita-type fashion, except that they are colored white. Hardy is very whimsical and likes to act upon her own desires; she is also a lesbian, and would like to claim Rory as her bride. As an incorporeal being, she can only directly interact with the mortal world if she takes possession of someone's body. She is also responsible for opening the original gateway to Earth in order to see the Empire plunged into chaos and enable a new beginning, and for awakening the Flame Dragon to destroy the Gate; a plan which was foiled when Itami killed the monster. ; : :Giselle is a member of the dragon folk, the youngest of the Twelve Apostles in the Special Region (at an age of just over 400 years), and Hardy's personal servant.

Upon her mistress' orders, she later ends up aiding the JSDF against Zorzal's forces and the cataclysmic effects of the Gate's continued existence. ; :Mentioned often but never seen, the God of Darkness, War, Violence, and Death is commonly represented by his Apostle, Rory Mercury. Under his doctrine, killing is not considered a sin, though the reason behind any killing determines the judgement which the perpetrators receive from Emroy. The souls of those who fall bravely in battle are drawn into Emroy's domain to serve him; most other souls are instead left for Hardy to claim. ; and :The Twin Gods of Knowledge and Learning, who founded the city of Rondel during their Apostle period. ; :The Special Region's God of Music. Sages of Rondel Rondel is a university city for studies in magic, natural science and history. It was founded by Elran and La over 3,000 years ago, and has produced a great number of renowned magicians and sages since that time. Next to Italica and the settlement at Alnus, it is also one of the few places within the Empire where demihumans enjoy the same basic rights as human beings. ; : :A magician who took in Lelei as his second disciple in magic. A slightly eccentric character, he moved away from Rondel to settle at the outskirts of Coda village, where he and Lelei first met the JSDF. In spite of his lecherous sense of humour, he plays a fatherly role for the refugees evacuated to Alnus by Itami; many in Rondel regard him as one of the strongest mages. In the anime series, however, he is reduced to the role of an oddball side character. ; : :Lelei's 24-year-old stepsister. She mainly focuses on alchemy and more specifically the study of minerals. This field is quite expensive in her world and receives little funding, causing her to live a life of poverty. To compensate for this, she works to create copies of books by hand (as the printing press wasn't invented in the Special Region), but the stress of her current lifestyle leaves her prone to violent fits of hysteria. And while she deeply cares about Lelei, Arpeggio feels jealous about how Lelei continually outachieves her and thus puts her authority as older sibling in question, and as a result of that the two sisters oftentimes end up quarreling. Owing to this volatile temper, Arpeggio is commonly nicknamed \\"Iron Alfie\\" by her peers. ; : :An elderly human sage specializing in natural history, and Arpeggio's mentor, who upon an assignment by Rory Mercury discovered the importance of the Gate to the Special Region races' collective history. She is very friendly and a happy-to-go personage, but unappropiately girlish for her age and quite accident-prone. ; :A young Elven research sage (sages not using arcane magic) specializing in astronomy, and the only one of his kind pursuing an academic career. He has a crush on Arpeggio, who is both flattered and embarrassed by his attentions and gentle manner. He does not appear in the anime. Other residents ; : :A male High Elf and Tuka's father, who was apparently killed by the Flame Dragon destroying their village while saving his daughter's life. However, it is later found out that he is still alive, if amnesic, and under the care of the Rurudo nomads, Lelei's ethnic tribe, where he has built up a harem and sired a half-blood daughter. ; : :A beast-man who is the leader of the Haryo, a tribe consisting of demihuman mixed-bloods who consider themselves the true rulers of the Special Region.

After the JSDF establishes a secret base in that area, she becomes the spokeswoman of the local demihuman prostitutes and their liaison with the SDF, particularly Mari Kurokawa, for medical treatment. In the novel and manga series, she becomes interested in Lt. Kenzaki, a Special Forces soldier stationed at the Imperial Capital outpost. Following Zorzal's takeover and the subsequent lockdown of the capital, she and the other demihumans forsake their former profession and get wealthy on smuggling much-needed food supplies past the blockade. ; : :A Siren, she was once a member of the bandit army that attacked Italica before being captured by the JSDF.

It's part of the Cascade Range and is a half mile east of the crest of the range. Mount Thomson is situated northeast of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff on the mountain drains into the Middle Fork of Snoqualmie River. The nearest peak is Alaska Mountain to the southeast, and the nearest higher peak is Chikamin Peak, to the east. The mountain was named for Reginald Heber Thomson (1856-1949), a Seattle city engineer who reshaped the face of Seattle. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1917 by Joe Hazard and B. French. Climate Mount Thomson is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Mount Thomson in winter Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology Mount Thomson The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Gameplay Capitol was a computer-moderated play-by-mail game involving twelve identically sized teams of 4‚Äì8 players in a race against the other teams to conquer the galaxy. A group of players could join the game as a team; otherwise, individual players were assigned to one of the teams. (Adventures by Mail tried to group individual players geographically so that they could contact each other to discuss strategy.) The game map was a 98 x 98 grid (9,604 squares) across which hundreds of worlds were scattered. Players would use the resources of their home world to design and build ships, then fan out, seeking to conquer new worlds, which in turn would give them the resources to explore further. When a player discovered a world controlled by a player from a different faction, combat would result. The object of the game was to be on the team that controlled the most worlds when the game ended, which could happen in one of two ways: * When three of the twelve teams had no worlds left * When the team with the most worlds had more than twice as many worlds as the second place team Turns were moderated by a computer every 10 days. The cost to play was $2.50 for the rulebook and plastic map overlay, and $2.50 per turn for up to 60 orders. (Players could buy 30 more orders per turn for $1.) Reception In the April 1985 edition of Dragon (Issue 96), Mike Gray liked the team aspect of the game, which differentiated it from other play-by-mail games of the time, and thought the team approach worked well. However he had a less-than-satisfactory experience in his first game, admitting that his inexperience led him to spend too much time developing his homeworld rather than exploring and discovering new worlds in order to harvest their resources. He concluded on an upbeat note, saying, \\"Capitol is a fun and very different experience. The rules are clear and easily understood, the overlays are a nice touch, and the teamwork aspect will prepare a novice for the individual diplomacy that must be developed in most other PBM games.\\" In the May-June 1985 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 74), Edmund Hack also had a less-than-optimal experience when, as an individual player, he was placed on a team with other players who were scattered across a wide geographic area. In the days before email, this made it difficult or expensive to coordinate turn- by-turn strategy. Hack's advice was to only sign up as a complete team, not as an individual: \\"I would recommend Capitol only for teams of players who ask to be set up together in the game... If you end up, like I did, on a 'pickup' team of players from different parts of the country who do not know each other, you are likely to be in for an uphill struggle. However, as a team game with your friends, Capitol can be challenging and exciting.\\" References Play-by-mail games ","title":"Capitol (play-by-mail game)"},{"id":"60512298","text":"Ustad Niaz Mohammad Chowdhury (born 25 October 1952) is a Bangladeshi classical and modern singer.

The fake sabotage was conducted during the night of January 29-30,1943 and was designed to fool German reconnaissance aircraft into believing that a large bomb had detonated inside the factory‚Äôs power plant. With the help of Jasper Maskelyne, a professional magician, and a team of camouflage experts, replica sub-transformers were created out of wood and papier-m√¢ch√©, buildings were camouflaged, and debris was littered around the plant to create the appearance from the air that it was damaged by an explosion. Eddie Chapman, a British double agent, was used to inform the Abwehr of the success of the \\"attack\\", which is what his German handlers sent him to England to do. The ruse proved successful in fooling the Abwehr, and Chapman was even awarded the Iron Cross in reward for his work.  Background  In prison at the time of the German occupation of the Channel Islands, Eddie Chapman concocted a plan to get off the island by notifying German officials of his willingness to become a spy. After transferring him to Fort de Romainville in Paris, Captain Stephan von Gr√∂ning, the head of Abwehr in Nantes, trained Chapman in espionage activities such as radio communications, explosives, and parachute jumping. Following his training, Chapman was dispatched to Britain to sabotage the De Havilland factory in Hatfield, which was manufacturing the Mosquito bomber aircraft. Shortly after landing off target near Littleport, Cambridgeshire, Chapman turned himself in to local police and offered to work for MI5, who decided to use him as a double agent. In order to maintain the German handler‚Äôs faith in Chapman, MI5 officials decided to fake the sabotage operation he came to Britain to conduct. Most importantly, they believed it needed to be widely reported throughout the media and the Times‚Äîthe British news source Stephan von Gr√∂ning followed. With the help of the Hatfield factory owner, who was made aware of the plot, Chapman traveled to the De Havilland plant and surveyed the site as if he was actually going to conduct the sabotage. After all, he would be interrogated upon his return to the Abwehr and must have a solid, consistent story of how he accomplished his mission. Upon analyzing the site, Chapman developed his ‚Äúplan‚Äù. After climbing a small barbed wire fence, he would place one suitcase, containing thirty pounds of explosives, nearby four transformers housed within a walled yard. Another suitcase would be placed in what German reconnaissance incorrectly identified as a subsidiary powerhouse but was really an old facility used for a swimming pool no longer in use. By priming the fuses on a one-hour delay, Chapman would be able to escape in time and deal a devastating blow to the factory. Realizing that it would be nearly impossible for one man to carry sixty pounds of explosives in two suitcases over a fence, he determined that he would need an ‚Äúaccomplice‚Äù. Before leaving for Britain, Abwehr officials told Chapman he could use members of his former ‚ÄúJelly Gang‚Äù, his small pre-war criminal group, as accomplices if needed. Therefore, Chapman would notionally seek the help of the former leader of the Jelly Gang, Jimmy Hunt, who was actually still in prison. In order to convince the Germans he was able to create the bombs, Chapman also went around to various stores to test whether it was possible to obtain all the ingredients necessary. Even with wartime rationing, he found it surprisingly easy to do this. = Significance of the De Havilland factory = For both military and political reasons, the Abwehr had designated the De Havilland factory as a target for sabotage operations in 1942. The Mosquito aircraft was designed at this factory north of London, and production began in 1940. The Nazis found the quick, versatile aircraft difficult to deal with, as it was capable of making trips to Berlin with 4000 pounds of bombs and had a maximum speed of four hundred miles per hour. The two-man crew planes were built almost entirely of wood and were able to be cheaply assembled by carpenters and cabinetmakers. Nicknamed \\"the Wooden Wonder\\", the aircraft was mainly used for target bombing missions because it was so light and was able to deliver bombs accurately. During the war, Mosquito bombers were responsible for the attacks on Gestapo headquarters in Norway and Denmark and the Amiens jail in German-occupied France. The head of the Luftwaffe, Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, was particularly envious of the British Mosquito: > It makes me furious when I see the Mosquito. I turn green and yellow with > envy. The British, who can afford aluminum better than we can, knock > together a beautiful wooden aircraft that every piano factory over there is > building, and they give it a speed which they have now increased yet again. > What do you make of that? They have the geniuses and we have the > nincompoops! After the war is over, I'm going to buy a British radio set ‚Äì > then at least I'll own something that has always worked! With the Nazis failing to effectively handle the Mosquito threat, they devised the plan to sabotage the De Havilland factory manufacturing them. If the production could be stopped, they thought, it could tip the scale of the air war in their favor. For Chapman‚Äôs handler Stephan von Gr√∂ning, the sabotage would demonstrate the skills of his newest spy and boost the reputation of the Abwehr as a whole. If the De Havilland factory proved to be too challenging of a mission for Chapman, contingency plans included attacking refineries of sugar and rubber, an aircraft propeller factory southwest of London, or simply leaving bombs in lockers at tube-stations.  Preparation and execution of fake sabotage  = Camouflaging the factory = Understanding that convincing the Germans that the sabotage at the De Havilland factory actually occurred would be a difficult task, the British sought the help of a professional magician, Jasper Maskelyne, and a team of camouflage experts. For this task, the British told them to make it ‚Äúlook, from the air, as if the place had been blown to Kingdom Come‚Äù. Initial plans called for placing asbestos sheets on the roof of the factory and then starting a fire, but this option was denied due to worries that the Luftwaffe would see the burning factory and may try to bomb it. Instead, the British decided to create a ‚Äúveil of camouflage‚Äù that would make it look, from both the air and the ground, as if the factory power plant was blown up by a large bomb. Four replica sub- transformers were created using wood and papier-m√¢ch√©, and two of them were rolled over as if they had been blown sideways by the explosion of the bomb. The real transformers were disguised, ‚Äúwith netting and corrugated iron sheets‚Äù, to create the appearance from the air that it was really just a large hole in the ground. On the night of January 29-30, the green wooden gates to the building that housed the transformers was replaced with green wooden gates that were damaged. The smaller building was covered by tarps that were painted to look like a half-demolished brick wall. Other walls of buildings were covered in soot as if the explosion blackened them, and debris was spread around the factory within a radius of 100 feet. The night to conduct the fake sabotage was decided, by military meteorologists, to be January 29-30 due to the long hours of darkness and lack of cloud cover. Since the moon was not expected to rise until 2:30AM, the British would have several hours of darkness to deploy their camouflage veil on the factory, and the lack of cloud cover would ensure the Germans could see the aftermath of the ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù. = Importance of the press = While creating a scene that the factory had exploded was vital to the operation, another vital aspect was that news sources in Britain published stories about the incident. Since Stephan von Gr√∂ning followed The Times looking for messages from Chapman, they decided that planting a false story in it of the sabotage would be most effective. However, the editor of The Times, Robert Barrington-Ward, refused to publish the story. Placing a story in his paper that he knew was not true, he said, went against his entire policy. With their first option being denied, MI5 decided to approach the Daily Express next. The editor, Arthur Christiansen, also noted that publishing a fake story was against his policy, but regardless decided to oblige. However, wartime censorship prevented newspapers from publishing anything that was likely to \\"encourage the enemy\\", and this certainly fit that category. Knowing that censors would call him and force him to remove it as soon as they saw the story, Christiansen decided to make a compromise with MI5 officials. He would publish the false account in the earliest edition of his paper that was sent to Lisbon, where the paper was distributed to German officials in Germany and across its occupied territories. The British concluded that even if the Germans realized the story was only published in the first edition, they would believe it was taken out in later editions because of the censors. Chapman notified his German handlers of the impending ‚Äúsabotage‚Äù, and the RAF Fighter Command was instructed to look for reconnaissance planes in the Hatfield vicinity but to in no circumstance engage them. If factory employees inquired about the camouflage, the owner of the factory was prepared to say it was a test ‚Äúto see if high- altitude photography can pick up minor damage‚Äù. In the event members of the press showed up, they were to be informed that ‚Äúsomething had occurred, but very small and not worthwhile reporting.‚Äù With all of this in place, MI5 officials believed rumors would begin to circulate about the alleged incident. On the night of January 29-30, the camouflage experts moved to the De Havilland factory and set up their ruse. Looking at the scene, MI5 officials were convinced that their plot would fool the Germans, despite the fact that there was thicker cloud cover than expected. Ronnie Reed, an MI5 officer responsible supervising Chapman, commented that ‚ÄúThe whole picture was very convincing‚Äù and that ‚Äúaerial photography from any height above 2,000 feet would show considerable devastation without creating any suspicion‚Äù. Following the operation, Chapman delivered a wireless message to Stephan von Gr√∂ning, who replied with a congratulations for completing the operation successfully. Upon his return to the Abwehr, Chapman was heavily interrogated but continued to fool the Germans that the sabotage actually took place. He was rewarded with 100,000 Reichsmarks for his work in England, and in recognition for his ‚Äúoutstanding zeal and success‚Äù, Stephan von Gr√∂ning presented Chapman with an Iron Cross. He remains the first and only British citizen to ever receive the medal.

He played mainly in the position of forward. He was known as Enderlin (I) because his brother Hermann Enderlin (II) played for Basel during the same period, but as a defender. Club career Between the years 1926 and 1933 Enderlin (I) played a total of 138 games for Basel scoring 68 goals. 85 of these games were in the Swiss Serie A, 13 in the Swiss Cup and 40 were friendly games. He scored 39 goals in the domestic league, 11 in the cup and the other 18 were scored during the test games. A well-documented curiosity was that at the end of Basel's 1929‚Äì30 season, the team set off on a Scandinavian football tour, including a visit to Germany. Six games were played in Norway, but the first was played in Leipzig. The team travelled with 15 players, their trainer Kert√©sz and two functionaries. The journey started with a train ride on 2 June 1930 at quarter past seven in the morning from Basel and they arrived in Leipzig at half passed eight that evening. The game against VfB Leipzig was played the next evening. The following one and a half days were spent travelling by train, train, ship, train and train again to Drammen in Norway. Only a few hours after their arrival, the team played a game against a joint team Mj√∏ndalen IF / SBK Drafn. The next day was a train journey to Porsgrunn and two matches in 24 hours. Following that they travelled per bus and then by ship in a 48-hour journey to Bergen for a match against SK Brann. Another ship voyage, this time to Stavanger, two games against Viking FK, then a ship voyage back to Bergen. Finally, the tour ended with three train journeys in three days, Bergen/Oslo/Berlin/Basel, arriving at home on 20 June. The result of this tour was seven games, four wins, one draw, two defeats and approximately 160 hours of travelling. Enderlin (I) was participant in this tour, but he played only in two of the games. Enderlin (I) was a member of the Basel squad that won the Swiss Cup in the 1932‚Äì33 season. The final was played in the Hardturm stadium against Grasshopper Club.

Narrated by musician and director Rob Zombie, the documentary focuses on the Manson family murders told from Manson's perspective using never-before-seen case files, pictures and exclusive interviews with so-called \\"Manson Family\\" members, Barbra Hoyt, Catherine Gillies, and Bobby Beausoleil. The documentary presents an \\"alternate theory\\" behind the so-called \\"Manson Family\\" crimes, proposing the murders were the result of a series of interconnected events surrounding Charles Manson, in contrast to the Los Angeles District Attorney's theory that the murders were the result of Manson's desire to start a race war he called \\"Helter Skelter.\\" The film premiered on REELZ Channel to much acclaim and was awarded the 2017 Audience Award at the Red Rock Film Festival, Best Dramatic Documentary at the Atlanta Docufest 2017, as well as and Official Selection of CUFF.Docs 2017 and the Calgary Underground Film Festival. The film was listed as recommended viewing by both the New York Times and the Washington Post. In 2018, Day directed the documentary Charles Manson: The Funeral for MyEntertainment which documented the legal battle over Manson's remains and subsequent funeral held by Manson's grandson Jason Freeman. In 2019, Day directed a third Manson related film called Manson: The Women for the Oxygen Channel. The documentary featured Lynette \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme, Sandra \\"Blue\\" Good, Diane \\"Snake\\" Lake, and Catherine \\"Gypsy\\" Share. Day wrote a book about his experiences speaking with Charles Manson, and the Manson Family, entitled Hippie Cult Leader: The Last Words of Charles Manson. The book featured Day's conversations with Manson over the last year of Manson's life, during which time Day uncovered an \\"alternate theory\\" for the Manson murders that disputes the alleged race-war motive known as Helter Skelter.\\"  Filmography  = Feature Length Documentaries = * The Salvation of Todd Bentley (2015) *Goalie: My Life in the Crease (Co-director) (2015) *Carisa Hendrix: Girl on Fire (2016) = Television Series and Specials = * Wild Obsession (2012- 2013) * Seasons of the Wild (2015) * Expedition Earth (2016) * The Shocking Truth (2015 - 2017) *Charles Manson: The Final Words (2018) *Casey Anthony: Her Friends Speak (2018) *Sex, Lies & Murder (2018 - 2019) *Slender Man Stabbing: The Untold Story (2019) *Charles Manson: The Funeral (2019) * The Disappearance of Susan Cox Powell (2019) *Manson: The Women (2019) *The Disappearance of the Millbrook Twins (2019)  References  External links * Canadian documentary film directors Canadian documentary film producers Living people Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"James Buddy Day"},{"id":"60512353","title":"List of ambassadors of Iran to Egypt"},{"id":"60512357","text":"Cim is a suburb of the city of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Contents In the early 1980s, some religious groups accused TSR, the publisher of Dungeons & Dragons, of encouraging sorcery and the veneration of demons. This was exacerbated in 1982, when Patricia Pulling's son killed himself. Pulling blamed D&D; for her son's suicide, and formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons) to attack the game and the company that produced it. In 1984, the Christian publisher Moody Publishing released Playing with Fire, a 91-page book by John Weldon and James Bjornstad that was critical of tabletop role-playing games, attempting to prove that role-playing games are morally ambiguous and dangerous for young, impressionable minds. Playing with Fire was subsequently favorably quoted by other Christian publications including Demon Possession and the Christian (C. Fred Dickason, Crossway, 1989) and Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs (John Ankerberg & John Weldon, Moody Publications, 1996). Reception In the May-June 1985 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 74), Steve LaPrade commented that \\"Like it or not, RPGers, parents are reading this book or hearing from those who have.

Prior to its acquisition by Oneida Ltd. in 1983, the company was one of the largest manufacturers of commercial chinaware in the United States. Early history 200x200pxBuffalo Pottery was founded in 1901 by John D. Larkin (1845-1926) to supply the Larkin Company with premiums for its customers. The company's first general manager, Louis Bown, recruited a number of skilled craftsmen and artisans from throughout the United States, including William J. Rea, Anna Kappler, and Ralph Stuart. Buffalo Pottery was located on 8.5 acres at Seneca Street and Hayes Place in Buffalo, New York. At the time of its completion in 1903, the 80,000 square foot plant was the largest fireproof pottery in the world; and it was also the only pottery in the world completely operated by electricity. 314x210px In addition to the china produced for distribution as premiums to Larkin customers, Buffalo Pottery produced many lines of semi-vitreous china, including Deldare Ware, Roosevelt Bears, and Abino Ware, as well as the first Blue Willow dinnerware manufactured in the United States. These wares were distributed via wholesale and retail channels. By 1911, the company had 250 employees and was selling its exports to 27 countries. In 1915, the company began manufacturing vitrified china and a few years later the plant was enlarged to 300,000 square feet. During World War I, it mainly manufactured china for the US armed forces. Under the leadership of John D. Larkin, Jr. (1877‚Äì1945) in the late 1920s, Buffalo Pottery changed its focus to manufacturing custom institutional, restaurant, railroad, steamship, and hotel ware. The company would produce ware for such entities as the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (George Washington and Chessie Cat services), the Greenbrier, the Ahwahnee Hotel at Yosemite, the Roycroft Inn, the 1939 New York World's Fair, and the US Navy. In 1931, Buffalo Pottery began production using its patented Lamelle process which reinforced the china to reduce breakage. From 1934‚Äì1937, Buffalo Pottery's art director was the noted modernist artist Ilonka Karasz. Buffalo Pottery George Washington Plate Made for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Intermediate years During World War II, the company again manufactured primarily for the US military. However, the company was declared a non- essential factory and was not permitted to replace employees who left to serve in the military. Having lost some of its best skilled labor and with competitors not subject to similar regulation, the company turned to automation, with new equipment funded by the sale of several buildings. In 1946, Robert E. Gould (1900‚Äì1979), known in the ceramics industry as the \\"master potter,\\" was named president. By this time, economic efficiency had forced the company to drop customization in favor of mass production of a limited catalog of designs. In 1956, the company changed its name from Buffalo Pottery to Buffalo China, Inc. Harold M. Esty, Jr. (1914‚Äì1986), John D. Larkin's grandson, served as the company's president from 1964 until 1970, overseeing the production of a wider range of designs and the installation of state-of-the-art direct screening, offset printing, and glaze equipment. By 1965, the company was producing a quarter of a million pieces of vitrified china per week in more than 50 patterns. Esty remained on the board of directors until the company's sale in 1983. Later years In 1970, John C. Heebner (1922‚Äì2013) became Buffalo China's fifth and last president. He oversaw a modernization project, completed in 1979, which increased the plant's capacity by 50 percent. In 1983, Oneida Limited purchased Buffalo China with Heebner serving on Oneida's board until 1994. Oneida increased Buffalo China's manufacturing space and added a manufacturing plant in Mexico. In 2004, due to an economic downturn, Oneida sold the factory in Buffalo to Niagara Ceramics Corporation and closed the factory in Mexico, thus ending Buffalo China's 100-year history of china manufacturing. As of 2019, Oneida still retains the Buffalo China trade name and logos, and sells a few lines of Buffalo brand dinnerware. Collectibles Buffalo Pottery and pre-1983 Buffalo China chinaware is considered highly collectible by antique, porcelain, hotel/restaurant ware, and railroad collectors. Rarer hand- decorated pieces of lines such as Deldare Ware and Abino Ware frequently selling for thousands of dollars each.

The changes were approved by 88.83% of voters who voted, with a 44% turnout. Preparation Plans to amend the constitution were prepared by the General Intelligence Directorate (Mukhabarat) around December 2018, with nearly daily meetings headed by el-Sisi's son Mahmoud el-Sisi, Deputy Director of the Mukhabarat. Some meetings were also attended by Abbas Kamel, the Director of the Mukhabarat. The initial plans were to extend the presidential term to six years while retaining a maximum of two terms and to weaken the powers of Parliament. Security services planned \\"wide-reaching arrest campaigns of civilian public figures from across the political spectrum\\" as a method of \\"not [tolerating] dissent on any scale regarding the amendments\\". Proposed amendments Article 140 is amended to lengthen the presidential term from four to six years and article 241 changes to lengthen el-Sisi's current term and allow him to stand for an additional term in office. Other changes restore the president's ability to appoint Vice-Presidents (which had been abolished in 2012) and strengthen the powers of the president over the judiciary, with modifications to articles 185, 189 and 193 making the president head of the Higher Council for Judicial Authorities, which would appoint the public prosecutor and judicial leaders, as well as giving the president the power to directly appoint the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court. Two amendments further embed the role of the military in government, with a proposed change to article 200 to state that the military should \\"preserve the constitution and democracy, maintain the basic pillars of the state and its civilian nature, and uphold the gains of the people, and the rights and freedoms of individuals\\". A revision of article 234 would make the army's role in selecting the Defence Minister a permanent requirement. Further amendments make the parliament a bicameral body, with the Shura Council abolished in 2014 restored as the Senate, which would consist of 120 elected members and 60 appointed by the president. Changes to article 102 reduce the number of members of the lower house from 596 to 450, with at least 112 seats reserved for women. On 16 April 2019, Parliament approved changes to the constitution; 22 MPs voted against the changes, with another MP abstaining. The changes were required to be put to a referendum within 30 days. Campaign The proposals were supported by Free Egyptians Party MP Mohamed Abu Hamed, who claimed el- Sisi needed more time in office to continue reforms. Multiple political parties, including the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, the Constitution Party, the Reform and Development Party, the Freedom Egypt Party, the Socialist Party of Egypt, the National Conciliation Party, the Conservative Party, and the Dignity Party (as well as MPs from the 25-30 Alliance), came together on 5 February 2019 to form the Union to Defend the Constitution, which launched a three-pronged campaign to defeat the amendments (gathering signatures, creating a \\"media platform\\" and opposing the amendments through the courts). Constitution Party member Khaled Dawoud claimed the proposals were a power-grab, while the Civil Democratic Movement has come out in opposition to the amendments. Other parties and organizations also opposing the amendments included the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party and the Revolutionary Socialists. The International Commission of Jurists called for the changes to be rejected, noting that the change to article 140 on presidential term lengths violates the entrenched clause of article 226, forbidding changes to texts pertaining to presidential re- election, except with more guarantees. A campaign named \\"BƒÅtil\\" (\\"null and void\\") was launched the week of 7 April to oppose the proposed amendments. However, the campaign website was blocked on 9 April 2019 after gathering over 60,000 signatures against the changes; according to NetBlocks, the government subsequently blocked over 34,000 other domains in order to restrict access to the campaign site. Opponents to the amendments faced government oppression according to Al-Monitor, which reported on a secretive grassroots group that hung banners and used graffiti to oppose the proposals. In his reading of the proposed amendments, political analyst and columnist Maged Mandour concludes that the changes to the constitution \\"will re-draw the Egyptian political system and remove the last pretence of separation of powers or the subordination of the military to the elected government. Egypt is set to become a military dictatorship in name as well as deed.\\" Conduct A judge in charge of a polling station in Cairo laid out various issues regarding electoral conduct, including combining unregistered and registered voters ballots, members of the pro-government Nation's Future Party at polling stations (and as poll workers), bribery with food and no oversight during the counting of ballots. Results Reactions Minutes after the results were announced, Sisi commented in a tweet, thanking the Egyptian people for voting 'Yes': \\"Wonderful scene done by Egyptians who took part in the referendum... will be written down in our nation's historical record.\\" The New Arab reported: \\"Pro-government media, business people and lawmakers had pushed for a \\"Yes\\" vote and a high turnout, with many offering free rides and food handouts to voters, while authorities threatened to fine anyone boycotting the three-day referendum.\\" Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists had previously urged the Egyptian government to withdraw the amendments, for they \\"would undermine judicial independence and expand military trials for civilians. If adopted, the amendments would weaken the rule of law, further erode fair trial guarantees and enshrine impunity for members of the Egyptian Armed Forces.\\" While National Election Authority chairman Lashin Ibrahim talked about \\"forces of darkness and evil\\" which boycotted the referendum in order \\"to destroy the democratic atmosphere in which it took place,\\" prominent Egyptian writer Alaa Al-Aswany, in an opinion piece on Deutsche Welle Arabic, provided reasons for why the referendum was \\"void, unconstitutional and undemocratic, describing el-Sisi as a \\"military dictator () exercising unprecedented repression upon people.\\" The BBC stated that the Egyptian authorities did not give the corporation accreditation to report on the vote.

The Kizh are an Indigenous people of Californiahttps://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:68f3a9ce-7d00-4fbb- af70-2cc47bfe1407pg8 from the Los Angeles Basin and the Southern Channel Islands, an area covering approximately . In the precolonial era, the people lived in as many as 100 villages and primarily identified by their village name rather than by a pan-tribal name. In 2013, it was reported that the Kizh Nation is based in San Gabriel, California and includes about 500 members.  Name controversy  During colonization, the people were referred to as Gabriele√±o and Fernande√±o, names derived from the Spanish missions built on their land: Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel and Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a. The name Tongva is the subject of considerable controversy within the Kizh Nation, who understand it as coming into existence in 1903 from the accounts of one ethnographer, C. Hart Merriam. Conversely, the Kizh understand that the name Kizh has origins in the earliest records of contact as a name the people used to refer to the willow branch, tule, and brush houses they lived in and was used widely by various ethnographers in the 19th and early 20th century. Despite this, Tongva remains the most widely circulated name, gaining popularity in the late 20th century. The word Tongva was recorded by C. Hart Merriam in October 1903 from a single informant, a 'Gabriele√±o' woman named Mrs. James Rosemyre (n√©e Narcisa Higuera), who lived around Fort Tejon, near Bakersfield. Merriam could not pronounce the village name Toviscangna, misinterpreted her response as a pan-tribal identifier, and abbreviated it as ‚Äútonve‚Äù or ‚Äútonvey‚Äù in his field notes; by his orthography, it would be pronounced , . Since tribal members referred to themselves primarily by their village name rather than a \\"national\\" or \\"pan-tribal\\" name. It is argued that Rosemyre was referring to her village name, not a overarching tribal name. From the perspective of the Kizh, Tongva was falsely promoted in the 1980s and 1990s until the point that it reached favorability. As stated by Kizh Nation (Gabriele√±o Band of Mission Indians) tribal spokesperson Ernest Perez Teutimez Salas, Tongva gained notoriety in 1992 when the tribe was approached by non- Native people who expressed that in order to save a sacred spring in Santa Monica from a major development project and receive federal recognition that the tribe needed to use the name \\"Tongva.\\" Although Salas had reservations about doing so and had never heard the term before, the tribe hesitantly supported the decision in order to save the spring, which was saved under the ‚ÄúGabriele√±o/Tongva Springs Foundation.‚Äù About a year later, contact with these individuals was cut off. As stated by Nadine Salas: \\"we used to have get- togethers, and then it was like they got what they wanted; they didn‚Äôt want anything to do with us anymore.‚Äù Kizh Nation biologist Matt Teutimez stated, \\"When you just throw it out into the universe, and it sticks, you go with it, and that‚Äôs what happened with the Tongva.\\" E. Gary Stickel observes that ethnologist John Peabody Harrington, who conducted extensive ethnographic work among the Southern California tribes, wrote in his notes (presently housed at the Smithsonian Institution archives) that the word tongva refers to where the Gabriele√±o people ground their seeds on rocks, and that the noun must be accompanied by a positional prefix. Stickel writes that the term tongva has been used mistakenly to refer to the tribe \\"when, according to Harrington, it refers to what archaeologists call a 'bedrock mortar', which is a rock outcrop with depressions in it created by Indians pounding pestles into them to process acorns and other plant products.\\" = Kizh = \\"Desert Cahuilla woman\\" by Edward S. Curtis (1926). The neighboring  î√≠vilÃÉuqaletem (Cahuilla) referred to the Kizh as Kisianos which has been cited as a potential source of Kizh. The name Kizh (pronounced Keech), sometimes spelled Kij, comes from the first construction of Mission San Gabriel in 1771. The people of the surrounding villages who were used as slave laborers to construct the mission referred to themselves as \\"Kizh\\" and the Spanish hispanicized the term as \\"Kichirenos,\\" as noted by ethnographer J.P. Harrington's consultant Raimundo Yorba. The word Kizh referred to the houses they lived in, \\"most of which were dome-shaped and made with a framework of willow branches and roofed over with thatching.\\" The neighboring  î√≠vilÃÉuqaletem (Cahuilla) referred to the people as Kisianos or \\"people of the willow-brush houses,\\" which has been cited as a potential source for the term Kizh. Following the destruction of the original mission, the Spanish relocated the mission five miles north and began to refer to the Kizh as \\"Gabriele√±o.\\" > ...Kizh for the Indians living near San Gabriel (i.e. Whittier Narrows > area)... According to Harrington's (ethnographer J.P. Harrington) consultant > Raimundo Yorba, the Gabrielino in the Whittier Narrows area referred to > themselves as Kichireno, one of a bunch of people that lived at that place > of San Gabriel which is known as Mission Vieja. Kichereno is not a place > name, but a tribe name, the name of a kind of people. In 1846, scholar Horatio Hale used the term Kizh in a United States government report on ‚ÄúEthnography and Philology.‚Äù Lieutenant Amiel Weeks Whipple, Thomas Ewbank, and William Turner used Kizh when publishing a ‚ÄúReport upon the Indian Tribes‚Äù in 1855 for the U.S. War Department. German scholar Johann Carl Eduard Buschmann used the term in a study on language in 1856 published in the German Royal Academy of Science. Further notable scholars who used Kizh throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries include George Bell (in 1856), Robert Gordon Latham (in 1860), Lewis H. Morgan (in 1868), Albert Samuel Gatschet (in 1877), Hubert Howe Bancroft (in 1883), Daniel G. Briton (in 1891), David Prescott Barrows (in 1900), and A. L. Kroeber (in 1907). In 1875, H. C. Yarrow stated that the name Kizh could not be verified at Mission San Gabriel. He reported that the natives called themselves Tobikhar and spoke the Spanish language more than their own. In 1885, Hoffman also referred to the natives as Tobikhar. In 1900, David Prescott Barrows used the term Kizh and stated that use of the term Tobikhar was incorrect: \\"Mr. Gatschet is in error when he speaks of the Serrano and San Gabriel Indians calling themselves Takhtam and Tobikhar, respectively. The words are unknown as tribal designations among these Indians themselves, and precisely this point constitutes the objections to them.‚Äù = Gabriele√±o = Gabriele√±o was the name assigned to the Indigenous peoples surrounding Mission San Gabriel by the Spanish. It was not a name that the people ever used to refer to themselves. However, it remains a part of every official tribe's name, either as \\"Gabriele√±o\\" or \\"Gabrielino.\\" Because of the disagreement between tribal groups surrounding usage of the term Tongva, Gabriele√±o has been used as a mediating term. For example, when Debra Martin, a city council member from Pomona, led a project to dedicate wooden statues in local Ganesha Park to the Indigenous people of the area in 2017, there was considerable conflict over which name, Tongva or Kizh, would be used on the dedication plaque. A tentative agreement was reached to use the term Gabriele√±o, despite its colonial origins.  History and culture  For a summary of Kizh history and culture, see the relevant content available on Tongva.  Toponymy  Eagle Rock adjacent to California State Route 134 (the Ventura Freeway) From the Spanish colonial period, Kizh place names have been absorbed into general use in Southern California. Examples include Pacoima, Tujunga, Topanga, Rancho Cucamonga, Azusa (Azucsagna), and Cahuenga Pass. Sacred sites that have not been totally demolished, destroyed, or built over include Puvunga, Kuruvungna Springs, and Eagle Rock. According to Kizh Nation chairman Andrew Salas, Eagle Rock was referred to as Ah-sowt-To-tah or \\"golden eagle rock\\" for the golden eagles that frequented that area. In other cases, toponyms or places have been recently named to honor the indigenous peoples. The Gabrielino Trail is a 28-mile path through the Angeles National Forest, created and named in 1970.

In an effort to design new antimalarial drugs, Niles studies the malaria parasite and investigates how it interacts with human hosts.  Early life and education  Niles was born in Anguilla, and stayed there until he finished high school. In high school he became interested in biology and chemistry. Niles studied chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated in 1994. During his undergraduate degree he completed a research project on nitrogenase. He was a graduate student in the Harvard‚ÄìMIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology, and worked under the supervision of Steven R. Tannenbaum. He earned an MD and PhD in Molecular Toxicology. During his doctorate he studied DNA damage caused by chronic inflammation and nitric oxide. He looked to understand the increased cancer risks with inflammatory diseases. Niles was a postdoctoral scholar in the University of California, Berkeley with Michael Marletta. His postdoctoral work was supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute.  Research and career  Niles was appointed to the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2008. He was awarded an National Institutes of Health Director's New Innovator Award. His research considers engineered parasites for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of malaria. He develops tools to regulate gene expression, as well as probes to interrogate the heme metabolism in malarial parasites and host‚Äìpathogen interactions. To do this, Niles developed an automated deformability cytometer that can measure the dynamic, mechanical responses of red blood cells. Niles is also interested in how plasmodium falciparum controls heme levels and designed a technique to monitor heme. Heme is a biomolecule that interacts with several malarial drugs. To study this, he created a heme-sensing protein, whose fluorescence diminishes upon binding to heme. By expressing the heme-sening protein in the target plasmodium falciparum parasite, Niles made it possible to monitor the levels of heme through changes in fluorescence. Niles used this to show that malarial parasites contain high levels of labile heme than anticipated. Additionally, Niles demonstrated that CRISPR could be used to disrupt parasite genes, which provides information about how parasites invade and replicate inside red blood cells. The Niles lab collect publicly available genomics and transcriptomics data of these parasites, then builds a sequence of technologies to enter parasites and manipulate when genes are expressed. Niles performs phenotypic screening to understand which parasites should be taken for further development. Niles embeds target information within the phenotypic screening, which, alongside compound efficacy, provides information about exactly which targets the compound is interacting with. Niles uses CRISPR gene editing to embed the technologies to control when genes are turned on or turned off. Once Niles has identified the specific genes a compound might target, he can control the expression of that gene to make parasites more susceptible to the compound, then map the sensitivity relationships to understand the relationships between compounds and target genes. He is part of a multi-institution investigation into apicomplexan parasites, working with Karine Le Roch at University of California, Riverside.

He served as captain of the national team in its first two modern-era test matches in 1976. Early life and club rugby career Bordley was born circa 1947, the eldest son of Robert Austin Joseph Bordley and Martha Ann Bordley (born Robinson). Bordley attended Landon School, graduating in 1966. During his time as a student at Landon, Bordley was a multi-sport athlete and earned 17 varsity letters. Bordley then attended Princeton University, where he was a member of the university's football and lacrosse teams, earning all-Ivy League honors in each sport. Bordley played at wide receiver for the football team and also returned punts and kicks. Bordley graduated from Princeton in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. After graduating from Princeton, Bordley joined the Washington Rugby Football Club (RFC) in 1970 and played with the team for more than a decade. During his time with Washington RFC, Bordley served as team captain, and was also selected for and captained representative teams with the Potomac Rugby Union and Eastern Rugby Union (ERU). In 1976, Bordley joined the ERU All Stars on a tour of South Africa.

She spent most of her life in Canton, Illinois, and is best known for serving as one of the first female finance executives in the United States. She served as director of the First National Bank of Canton from 1877 until her death in 1907, and as Vice President of the bank from 1899 until her death. Banking During the years prior to the American Civil War, U.S. banking was a largely unregulated profession. Banks were not government-inspected for financial probity and could issue their own paper currency. Other businesses, such as the distillation of alcoholic liquor, were also unregulated. In 1861-1865, as part of the Civil War, the Lincoln Administration adopted a sharply different policy. To control alcohol consumption and raise money to fight the war, distillers were heavily inspected and made to pay a substantial federal tax. Banks were strongly encouraged to seek a charter as a \\"national bank\\" in their communities. The Lincoln Administration took steps, under the table, to steer banking charters and distillery licenses to their friends in the Republican Party. Strongly Republican, the city of Peoria and its central-Illinois environs became a hub of the banking and distilling industries. This was good news for Peoria's James Harvey McCall and Louisa Raymond McCall, who had married in 1845. In 1862, the couple saw an opportunity to become ground-floor participants as the Peoria area moved into a new business paradigm. The couple and their family moved to a nearby town, Canton, to operate a distillery. Soon, the couple helped start up a national bank to serve Canton. The bank was chartered in 1864 and was successful, but in 1873 James McCall died. After some litigation, Louisa McCall was left with a substantial fortune, including a major equity stake in her hometown bank. In 1877 the First National Bank of Canton elected the widow to be a bank director. She is believed to be the first female director of a bank in United States financial history. Louisa McCall maintained her stake and her active participation in bank affairs. Her colleagues elected her Vice-President of the bank in 1899, thus extending her status as a financial pioneer. By this time Canton had become a small industrial city with a substantial presence in coal mining and farm machinery, and the First National Bank of Canton had survived through a long list of financial panics and economic recessions. McCall continued as Vice President and director of the First National Bank of Canton until her death on January 11, 1907. See also * Maggie L.

History Pavel Yaguzhinsky ‚Äì First Prosecutor General of Russia The post of Prosecutor General was established by Peter the Great on January 12, 1722. Its predecessor, but with lesser powers, was the post of auditor general, which existed in 1715 ‚Äì 1718. The first prosecutor general was appointed Pavel YaguzhinskyProsecutor General // Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary: in 86 Volumes (82 Volumes and 4 Additional) ‚Äì Saint Petersburg, 1890‚Äì1907. The Prosecutor General was initially the head of the Senate office and was in charge of the Senate office work; at the same time, he headed the prosecutor's office, which consisted of a three-stage system of control over the Senate and all administrative and judicial institutions, both central and local. Assistant to the Prosecutor General in the Senate was the Chief Prosecutor. Control over the activities of the authorities was carried out through subordinates ‚Äì prosecutors and fiscals. The initial duties of the procurator-general included checking that the Senate decisions comply with the laws in force, as well as overseeing decency during meetings. The Prosecutor General was also a mediator in matters between the Senate and the sovereign. Supervision contributed to putting in order the production of cases both in the very presence of the Senate and in its office; the value of the Senate as an effective authority has grown. On the other hand, the establishment of the post of Prosecutor General deprived the Senate of its former relative independence; often, by law, equal to the entire Senate, the Prosecutor General in many cases actually prevailed over him. After the death of Peter I, the value of the post fell along with the influence of the Senate itself: the Supreme Privy Council established on February 8, 1726, became the most powerful. Prosecutor General Yaguzhinsky was appointed a resident in Poland, and the post of Prosecutor General was effectively abolished; her nominal execution was entrusted to the Chief Prosecutor Voeikov, who had no influence in the Senate. In March 1730, after the abolition of the Supreme Privy Council by Empress Anna Ioannovna, the Senate was restored to its authority, and in October it was deemed necessary to reinstate the position of prosecutor general; however, a year later, after the establishment of a new central authority ‚Äì the Cabinet (consisting of three cabinet ministers) ‚Äì the influence of the Senate fell again; no appointment has occurred. In the interregnum from the death of Anna Ioannovna to the accession of Elizabeth Petrovna, the role of the Senate began to increase; the post of Prosecutor General was reinstated; Prince Nikita Trubetskoy was appointed to it. On December 12, 1741, shortly after taking the throne, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna issued a decree abolishing the Cabinet and restoring the Governing Senate; convenient prince Trubetskoy remained in his post and held this post almost all the time of the empress's reign, in his subordination was also the all-powerful Secret Office. All the prominent political courts of Elizabethan rule passed through his hands: the case of Andrey Osterman, Burkhard von M√ºnnich in 1742; the case of Field Marshal Stepan Apraksin in 1757 and Chancellor Bestuzhev-Ryumin in 1758. In 1762, Catherine the Great significantly reformed the Senate on her accession to the throne; Prince Alexander Vyazemsky was appointed to the post of Prosecutor General. He was among the special trustees of Catherine, she entrusted him with many complex cases. After some time, the duties of the Prosecutor General already included the management of justice, finance, the state treasury, and, as before, state supervision of the authorities. Like his predecessors in the post, he headed the body of political investigation ‚Äì the Secret Expedition, the \\"heiress\\" of the Secret Chancellery. He supervised the investigation of Yemelyan Pugachev and other impostors (False Third Peters), Alexander Radishchev, publisher Nikolay Novikov and others. After his resignation in 1792, the duties of the Prosecutor General were distributed among several officials. With the reform of public administration undertaken by Alexander I, since 1802, the position of the head of the Senate was combined with the position of minister of justice and acquired his final terms of reference: the prosecutor general was the head of the prosecutor's office and the office of the Senate and also enjoyed the right to supervise the activities of officials of the entire judicial department. Without significant changes, the post of Prosecutor General existed until the February Revolution of 1917.

The election was officially nonpartisan. The election was won by Boise City Council president Lauren McLean, who defeated the incumbent Dave Bieter in a runoff election held on December 3, 2019. Background In the 2019 Boise mayoral election, incumbent mayor Dave Bieter sought a fifth term. He had won re-election four years earlier with a 40-point lead over his closest challenger, Judy Peavey-Derr, and had enjoyed comfortable margins in each of his previous re-election campaigns. During his fourth term, Bieter faced controversy, in particular opposition to his plan to build a $100 million library. The proposed library was perceived by some, including 2019 mayoral candidate Wayne Richey, as a \\"West Coast amenit(y)\\". Former mayor (and future candidate) H. Brent Coles, at a city council meeting, argued the money should be spent instead on police and fire stations. Ada County Clerk, Phil McGrane, refused to place the issue on the 2019 ballot, and stated that he would change his mind only in the event of a challenge in court. Bieter declined to mount a legal challenge, in part due to the fact that initial cost estimates were far lower than subsequent estimates. In a statement, Bieter wrote that he \\"believe(s) a new Main Library is vital to the future of our city and (he) will remain dedicated to making sure we have one [...] However, with little time before ballots must be printed, and to avoid further confusion among residents, a court action simply isn‚Äôt viable at this time.\\" Candidates *Rebecca Arnold, Ada County Highway District president *Dave Bieter, the incumbent mayor since 2004, ran for his fifth term. Bieter is a member of the Democratic Party. *H. Brent Coles, former mayor of Boise who resigned after accepting an trip to the 2002 Winter Olympics from an insurance company *Adriel Martinez, former Boise City Council candidate. *Lauren McLean, Boise City Council president, ran in what the Idaho Statesman called \\"a direct challenge\\" to Bieter's attempt at a fifth term. *Cortney Nielsen, a representative for Acosta Sales & Marketing General election As Boise's mayoral elections are nonpartisan, neither party nominated a candidate. A total of seven candidates appeared on the ballot. The race featured two candidates who had been mayors of Boise: the incumbent mayor, and 1993-2003 mayor Brent Coles. Incumbent mayor Bieter emphasized that his goals for a fifth term included ensuring access to affordable housing, making Boise carbon-neutral by 2035, and building the new library, while \\"making sure the project is completed within the budget set by the city\\". Coles was appointed mayor in 1993 then twice won re-election, but was removed from office in 2003 when he, as well as his chief of staff and the city human resources director, pleaded guilty in 2003 to misusing public funds. Coles campaigned on his record as mayor, including the consolidation of the city's transport system and his expansion of the police department. He also vowed to \\"re-prioritize public safety and neighborhoods and curb the growth in city spending\\". City Council President Lauren McLean campaigned on affordable housing, improved transit conditions, and transparency in local government. She received the endorsement of Planned Parenthood. McLean argued that discouraging sprawl is the most effective way to address the influx of newcomers to the city. She also refused to accept funds from corporations for her campaign, although she did receive donations from business people. Candidate Rebecca Arnold, the three-times-elected President of the Ada County Highway District, described herself as a \\"fiscal conservative\\" and was openly critical of Mayor Bieter, arguing that he had displayed an \\"inability to work with other agencies, such as ACHD and the legislature\\". She also argued property tax increases were excessive, and that the city was spending money on a number of \\"vanity projects\\". Wayne Richey, an auto mechanic, campaigned on a platform of discouraging Californians from migrating to Boise. He argued that they were changing the culture of the city, expected too many \\"amenities\\", and drove up housing prices. He mounted his campaign at the behest of former Idaho Senator Larry Craig, his neighbor. Cortney Nielsen argued that the city's wages were too low, and also promised to \\"advocat(e) for a statewide emissions test to clean our air\\". Bieter and McLean each raised more than $200,000 for their campaigns. Boise State Public Radio wrote that the race was much closer than usual, and quoted College of Idaho professor Jasper LiCalzi, who argued that the candidates defied the typical categorization of \\"a typical Republican and a typical Democrat and a few fringe people\\", positing that there were \\"three significant campaigns\\" vying for votes, which made a runoff election (in the event that no candidate yields more than 50 percent of the vote) more likely than usual. Bieter and McLean advanced to a runoff mayoral election, the first in Boise since 1965, when Jay S. Amyx defeated Eugene W. Shellworth. In 2006, the city abolished runoff elections for City Council seats, but maintained runoff elections for mayoral races. McLean won the runoff by a landslide, defeating Bieter by over 31%.

The Watson Lake Rearing Unit, a division within the hatchery, is responsible for rearing approximately 300,000 catchable trout each year. The hatchery stocks fishing sports in Wellington, Fort Collins, Loveland, Longmont and Jumbo Reservoir near Julesburg and Hale ponds. This hatchery also contains Colorado's Fish Research Hatchery, which first began operation in 1968. The staff is responsible for the improvement of hatchery techniques and aquaculture advancement. Methods include conducting feed and fish strain performance evaluations and work to improve both rearing survival and post- stocking survival of hatchery fish. Various areas of study include whirling disease resistant strain research, broodstock, and optimization of production. History Bellvue-Watson was inaugurated in 1914 and its building was completed in 1924. The fish research hatchery followed these establishments in 1968. In September 2013 a flood devastated the hatchery, forcing it to close. After several years of repairs, the hatchery was able to reopen in 2017 Mission An overarching mission among the hatchery staff is educating the public. The facilities provide fish for stock in many areas which supports angling recreation. The facility offers educational materials and tours. Along with this, hatchery technique advancement is a strong goal of the aquatic research facility. Fish Species The Bellvue-Watson hatchery raises catchable rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, splake, brown trout and rainbow/cutthroat trout hybrids.

Arye was a New York-based artist and most of her exhibitions were in New York City. Education Leonora Arye was born in New York City in 1931. There she took several courses at the Arts Student League, focusing mainly on painting. She was admitted into Heidelberg College, now known as Heidelberg University, where she obtained her bachelor's degree. After graduating from college, she moved to Mexico for a few years, where she studied at the University of Mexico (UNAM.) Her work was heavily influenced from her time in Mexico and some of her pieces are derived from the indigenous community found there. Arye's learning and studying did not end there, though. She also worked alongside Lorrie Goulet and Hana Geber, who are credited as having brought awareness to women in sculpting. Arye infused Goulet's core beliefs into her own sculptures; both artists' work dealt with motherhood and the struggles female artists face when trying to expand their careers. Personal life Arye was for 37 years married to Leonard Arye, who founded Arye, Lustig & Sassower, P.C. On October 8, 2001, Leonora Arye succumbed to with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a rare type of cancer. Arye was survived by her husband, three sons, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. One of her sons went on to marry and have a son and daughter. Selected artworks =La Madre= The Spanish title of this sculpture translates to \\"The Mother\\". This is an alabaster sculpture that physically shows a mother holding her child close to her chest. Her woman's is \\"distorted\\" to show the struggles of women, especially those coming from a minority background. Arye wanted to show the difficult decision some women faced when deciding what path they waned to follow, either choosing motherhood or a successful career. According to Latin American Women Artists of the United States, this was particularly true for Arye. After starting a family her career was somewhat hindered. =El Rebezo= The title of this alabaster sculpture roughly translates to \\"The Shawl\\" in English. This sculpture infuses a cultural staple in Latin American culture, the rebozo. This piece of clothing is worn mainly by women and has been referred to as a ‚Äúpowerful symbol of Mexican culture.‚Äù Arye portrayed a woman with strong facial features. Often those features are correlated to people of indigenous descent. Her hair is long and flows down her back. This woman shows no fear, and her face is looking up, showing resilience and hope. =Amigas= This sculpture is composed of three different woods: chestnut, rosewood, and maple. This makes this piece very rare in Arye's collection, as most of her pieces are composed of alabaster. This sculpture shows two grown women holding each other in a caring, intimate way. Yet at the same time there is a sense of distance, because both figures are looking past each other. Per the artist, this sculpture represents women in the art world. Although most female artists help each other throughout their careers there are certain obstacles that could only be crossed individually.

While there have been a number of other murders, the term \\"Mount Isa Murders\\" here refers to the Spear Creek Killings. This triple murder took place in October 1978 and remained unsolved until April 2019.  History of the area  The Mount Isa area has a history of murders and unsolved crimes. Historically, the Mount Isa area was a region of economic and social instability. In the 1930s, entrepreneurs seeking economic gain from mining and farming land in the area caused significant social change. The introduction of a class structure disrupted the social balance of the area. These social structures were a fundamental influence on the type of crimes that were committed. During the Depression and World War II, itinerant workers entered the Mount Isa area in large numbers, increasing crime rates significantly. Thefts and violent crime greatly increased. It was a time of social, political and economic pressure. There were tensions between social groups, mining and farming industries, and classes. This pressure is no longer so prevalent but crime rates have remained high. From 2012 to 2018, crime rates in North West Queensland have increased from 7,310 offences, to 9,842 offences. Violent crime rates in far North Queensland are more than double the Queensland average. In the Mount Isa area specifically, crime rates are quadruple the state average. This could be explained by the relatively low socio-economic status and the high unemployment rates of the Mount Isa area.  The Spear Creek Killings  On the morning of October 24, 1978, a passing Mount Isa local came across three bodies in the Spear Creek bushland. The trio, Karen Edwards (23), Tim Thomson (31) and Gordon Twaddle (21) and their 9 month old Doberman, Tristie, were last seen leaving a caravan park in Mount Isa on October 5, 1978. Edwards and Thomson rode on a distinct red and gold 1977 BMW 100s with a homemade side car which carried their Doberman. Gordon rode a blue 1977 Suzuki GS750. Witnesses saw the three friends accompanied by an unidentified man on the same day. This unidentified man became a suspect, with sightings of both him and his vehicle (a brown and white Toyota Land Cruiser) in several locations around the time of the murders. He was never found or charged and his identity remains unknown. Police reopened the case in March 2019, urging anyone with information to come forward. = Victims = Karen Edwards and her partner Tim Thomson, along with his friend Gordon Twaddle were on a motorcycle expedition through central Australia, travelling from Alice Springs towards Melbourne. They were last seen in the Moondurra Caravan Park in Mount Isa, where they appeared to have befriended another man, who police later stated was a person of interest. All three were found shot dead north of Mount Isa in North West Queensland at Spear Creek on October 24, 1978. The body of Karen Edwards was discovered by local resident, Stan Harris while on a walk at Spear Creek with his greyhounds. He found her body sprawled against a tree. The following morning, police found the bodies of Tim Thomson and Gordon Twaddle, nearby and similarly positioned. All three bodies had been left to decompose in the open. = Timeline of Events = * September 30, 1978: Edwards arrived in Alice Springs where she met up with Thomson and Twaddle before they rode North. * October 2, 1978: The trio stopped at Aileron in the Northern Territory where they camped overnight. * October 3, 1978: The friends made four stops at Wauchope, Devils Marbles, The Three Ways and Frewena before they camped overnight in the Barry Caves. Between The Three Ways and Frewena, they met up with another male motorcyclist who travelled on with them to their campsite at the Barry Caves. * October 4, 1978: It is believed this male cyclist continued to travel with the friends until they reached Moondarra Caravan Park, where the trio and their dog checked in for two nights. That evening, another unidentified man driving a brown and white Toyota Land Cruiser joined the friends at the campsite. * October 5, 1978: The trio were last seen leaving the caravan park in the morning. That afternoon, the Toyota Land Cruiser returned to the caravan park and witnesses reported hearing a male voice calling for Thomson's Doberman, Tristie. * October 6, 1978: Tristie was found abandoned at the Mount Isa Dump. * October 24, 1978: The bodies of Edwards, Thomson and Twaddle were discovered by a local on a morning walk. * October 30, 1978: The helmets, gloves, jackets, tents and other possessions of the friends were found at the Mount Isa Dump. = Police investigation = The original investigation focused on linking the triple murder to other murders at the time. The murder of John Tzelaidis in Western Australia was originally thought to be associated with the Mount Isa Murders. There is little public information on the original investigation and a suspect was never identified or charged. In 2018, detectives from the Cold Case Investigation Team along with the Mount Isa Criminal Investigation Branch launched a review of the unsolved triple homicide. This included a review of the information provided by witnesses over the years. In March 2019, a new appeal was made by police, urging anyone with information regarding the murders to come forward. These appeals led to almost 50 leads in the span of a week. Police revealed that while some of these contained information they already had, there were some new leads.  Conviction  On Friday 12 April 2019, the Homicide Cold Case Investigation Team arrested 63 year old Goulburn man and former prison guard, Bruce John Preston, on three counts of murder. Preston was known to the victims, and was originally interviewed by police in 1978, when they found him in possession of Edwards' distinct red and gold motorcycle with sidecar. Preston had the motorcycle cleaned, the wheels changed and parts removed. In 1978, he was convicted of theft of the vehicle and fined $300. Despite this progress in the 2019 investigation, police continue to look for any further information regarding the killings, and are offering indemnity from prosecution for any accomplice who can provide insight. Detective Senior Sergeant Tara Kentwell stated that little was known regarding Preston's motives. Preston's lawyer appeared in court on behalf of the accused in April 2019, stating that his client denied being in Mount Isa at the time of the murders and would be appealing the charges. His claim contradicted by an earlier statement in an interview prior to his arrest when he stated that he was in Mount Isa when the three friends went missing. Preston remained in custody and was not permitted to apply for bail. The crown prosecutor in the case denied bail based on remarks made by Preston which indicated he might take his own life to avoid a prison sentence: \\"I am not going to prison. I'd rather walk out into the street and blow my head off before I go to jail.\\" Preston made this comment during a recorded phone conversation with his wife while in police custody.  Circumstantial evidence  The friends were last seen entering a brown Toyota Land Cruiser. At the time, Preston's father owned a car similar to this description. Preston was also on a motorcycle trip across Australia at this time. Witnesses saw a man matching Preston's description with the victims the night prior to their murder and he was found in possession of Edwards' distinct red and gold motorcycle. He was charged with theft at the time but maintained that he had found the motorcycle.  Victim statements  The following are excerpts from family members of the victims in 2019, following the : \\"Tim was a kind and gentle and much loved brother and always obliging when asked for help in any way... He loved his dog and old motorcycles in equal parts...Tim invited me to go on the trip through the centre of Australia with him and Gordon and Karen but I was unable to go otherwise I would probably not be writing this letter. My parents were shattered by the murders and I still feel a numbness that I don‚Äôt think will ever disappear.\\" - Statement from David Thomson (Tim Thomson's brother) \\"I write this statement for my brother Gordon Twaddle who was murdered in Australia. This horrible event has played on my mind for 40 years and I feel for the families of these three friends who were cold bloodily murdered. Gordon my brother was not only my best friend but we had a common interest in motorcycling which created a very strong bond between us. I also knew Tim as a friend but unfortunately had never met Karen but knowing the two boys I am sure she was a lovely person. It was that interest in motorcycling that found him in the wrong place at the wrong time. I feel that a result and conviction of the person (persons) responsible for these murders would bring some peace of mind and form some closure but it will never take away the pain of knowing how their lives ended far too soon in such a horrible way. Finally, I would like to thank the Australian Police for continuing to investigate this case over such a long period of time. I trust that you may now have a solid case to convict this person (persons). - Statement from John Twaddle (Gordon Twaddle's brother)  Other murders in northern Queensland  The Murder of Frederick and Phillis Mabb, 2009 In 2009, an 82 year old man was found murdered in his Mount Isa home, and his wife (71) was found seriously injured. She sustained significant head injuries and was placed in an induced coma at Mount Isa Base Hospital. She later died in hospital. The suspect, Donald Tommy George, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2012, with a mandatory non-parole period of 20 years. The Murder of Scott Maitland and Cindy Masonwells, 2012 In July, 2012, Mount Isa couple Maitland and Masonwells were murdered by Cairns mechanic Peter MacGowen after a disagreement over restoration to their panel van. Maitland was shot in the back of the head, and Masonwells was stabbed. Their bodies were dumped near a dam in Copperload, Cairns. MacGowen was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, and his appeals were dismissed. The Murder of Kyle Coleman, 2014 In February 2014, Mount Isa teenager Coleman (17), left on a camping trip with his friend James Coleman (no relation) (21). James returned home some days later, but earlier than expected, and without Kyle. A few days later, James took his own life. In a statement released by the coroner Stephanie Williams, there was no concrete evidence to suggest that James had intentions to harm Kyle, and the coroner proposed that it was likely Kyle died of a shooting accident. Investigating officers, however, believed James' statements to be misleading and untruthful, with his subsequent suicide suggesting his guilt. The murder of Michael McCabe, 2015 25 year old North Queensland man, McCabe, was murdered in 2015. His badly battered body was found decomposing in a creek bed in a national park near Townsville. Three people stood on trial for their alleged involvement in McCabe‚Äôs murder, one charged with murder, another with unlawful assault occasioning bodily harm whilst in company, and the third charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder. All three pleaded not guilty in front of the Townsville Supreme Court. The autopsy report documented fractures believed to be from blunt force trauma with blows to the skull potentially caused by a rock. On May 15, 2015, a 45 year old Townsville man who underwent a separate trial was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty for the murder. Witness statements suggested that the motive behind McCabe's murder might have been a $10,000 debt he owed to the Rebels Motorcycle Club. The Murder of Toyah Cordingley, 2018 Cordingley, a 24 year old Cairns woman, was found murdered on Wangetti Beach in far North Queensland in October 2018. Detectives believe the young woman was attacked on October 21, 2018 while walking her dog. Media outlets have released speculation that a suspect has fled the country. Police have not provided any further information other than revealing the investigation is ongoing.

She wrote three pocket diaries for the years 1863, 1864, and 1865 recounting her perspective on the Emancipation Proclamation, the battle of Gettysburg, and the mourning of President Lincoln.Memorable Days: The Emilie Davis Diaries at Villanova University web site Davis attended the Institute for Colored Youth. She was affiliated with several black churches.  Writings  Between 1863-1864, Emilie described going out for ice cream on four separate occasions, an indication of the expanding space that black Philadelphians inhabited during the Civil War. Earlier, in the summer of 1857, Charlotte Forten and a friend had been refused service at three Philadelphia ice cream parlors before they gave up. Emilie was a member of the Ladies' Union Association of Philadelphia, that raised money and collected supplies for the U.S. Colored Troops. Ladies' Union members fought street car segregation in the city.Judith Giesberg, Army at Home: Women and the Civil War on the Northern Home Front, Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2012, Chapter 4. Davis wrote about several notable lectures and concerts she attended. On January 25, 1865, she attended a lecture by Reverend James Sella Martin, a former slave and fiery Baptist minister. On February 16, 1865, she attended a lecture by Frederick Douglass. On February 27, 1865, she attended a lecture by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper. On May 11, 1964, she attended a concert by Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield. On September 14, 1865, she attended a concert by Thomas Wiggins, which was segregated and where she was required to sit in the balcony.  Marriage and family  On December 13, 1866, Emilie (\\"Emily\\" on the marriage registry) married George Bustill White, a barber, whose father, Jacob C. White, Sr., was a prominent black businessman. Emilie's brother-in-law was Jacob C. White, Jr., who co-founded the Philadelphia Pythians, a black baseball team, and who became principal of the all-black Roberts Vaux Junior High School. George was active in the Pennsylvania Equal Rights League, a group that lobbied successfully in Harrisburg for state support for federal civil rights amendments and for a variety of state level measures, such as integration of Philadelphia's streetcars in 1867. Emilie and George had six children, Jacob C. White (b. 1867), Maria, Emilie (b. 1873), George (b. 1875), Carry (b. 1877), and Julia (b. 1881). In the 1880 census, Emilie‚Äôs occupation was listed as ‚Äúhousekeeper.‚Äù In later years, Emilie contributed money to her church and rented a pew under her own name.

It measures and has been held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum since 1910. Sometimes described as a nocturne, it depicts a group of men on horseback lit by the moon in the murky pre-dawn. An unseen adversary has fired upon the man on a white horse. The painting was bought by William T. Evans in November 1909, and he donated it to the Smithsonian Gallery of Art, now the Smithsonian American Art Museum. It was the first painting by Remington to be acquired by a US public gallery. The painting was displayed in the Oval Office during the presidency of Harry S. Truman. Later presidents preferred bronzes by Remington, such as The Bronco Buster or The Rattlesnake. Remington's paintings of the Wild West were later copied by Western filmmakers, with John Ford saying that his 1948 movie She Wore a Yellow Ribbon: \\"I tried to copy the Remington style there.

The Minard Editor Award is named in his honor. Early life Lawrence Minard was born in Seattle, Washington, to Nancy and Everett Lawrence Minard Jr., on November 19, 1949. He had two brothers, Frank and Michael, and spent part of his childhood in Juneau, Alaska. Minard earned a B.A. in economics from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and studied political economics at The New School in New York City. Career Minard joined Forbes magazine in 1974 as a researcher and reporter. He soon forged a friendship with Steve Forbes, then a fellow rookie reporter, that lasted the rest of his life. In 1977, Minard and David Warsh shared the 1977 Gerald Loeb Award for Magazines for their article \\"Inflation Is Too Serious a Matter To Leave to the Economists,\\" in which they argue that inflation is made worse by higher taxes forcing merchants to raise their prices, and that economists fail to take historical factors into account. Minard was a special correspondent in Asia in 1978. He moved to London to become the Europe bureau chief in 1979, then to Los Angeles in 1983 to be the West Coast and Asia bureau chief. In 1985, he was promoted to assistant managing editor. He became the deputy managing editor in 1987, and was named managing editor in 1989. Forbes came under criticism in 1996 over allegations in Fortune magazine that Forbess biggest advertisers were shown and allowed to make changes to articles in advance of publication, but were themselves off- limits to editorial criticism. Minard responded that advertisers were shown articles critical of them in case they wanted to pull their ads from the issues containing those articles, but they did not affect editorial decisions at the magazine. Minard was widely expected to eventually replace James Michaels as the top editor of Forbes when he was instead chosen to become the first editor of Forbes Global magazine in 1997. Forbes had been licensing its name to various international publications, but decided to launch its own international business magazine to compete with The Economist and the international editions of Business Week, Fortune, and The Wall Street Journal. Forbes Global launched in April 1998 with Minard editing from New York City as well as writing the \\"Sidelines\\" column. Minard described the magazine's target reader as \\"[a] Swedish woman working for a French company based in Singapore and selling to the Chinese.\\" In 2001, he moved to London to better focus the magazine on the business world outside of North America. Minard won the Business Journalist of the Year award twice while at Forbes Global: first in 1999 for the November 30, 1998, cover story, \\"Act Two\\", then again in 2000 for the October 4, 1999, cover story, \\"Young, Rich, and Restless.\\" Personal life Minard married Elizabeth Bailey, and they had two children, Sara and Julia. He enjoyed travel, skiing, sailing, and mountain climbing. On August 2, 2001, Minard and his daughter Julia went on a guided climb to the top of Mount Rainier in Washington. While ascending Disappointment Cleaver, he stopped at 12,000 feet elevation complaining of difficulty breathing, then stopped breathing altogether after a few minutes. A guide administered CPR to no avail. The coroner ruled he died from a heart attack caused by coronary artery disease. Honors The Minard Editor Award was created in Minard's honor after his death by the UCLA Anderson School of Management as part of the Gerald Loeb Awards to recognize business editors whose work does not receive a byline or whose face does not appear on air for the work covered. Minard received the first award posthumously in 2002. The trophy was presented to his wife Elizabeth by his longtime friend Steve Forbes at the awards ceremony.

It was founded in 2012 by Shmuel Auerbach, as a reaction to the Bnei Brak-based Degel HaTorah's perceived moderate approach to the question of conscription of Haredim into the Israel Defence Forces by the Israeli government that came up following the expiration of the Tal Law. The organization is known for its civil disobedience against Haredi conscription that takes the form of street demonstrations that often end in arrests. It has its own newspaper, Hapeles, and political party, which has won city council seats in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, and Modi'in Illit. It has been referred to as \\"hard-line\\",Blumenthal, Itay (12 March 2018) \\"Jerusalem Faction Members Clash with Police in anti-Draft Protest\\", Ynetnews.com \\"extremist\\",Rabinowitz, Aaron (26 February 2018) \\"Analysis: Extremist ultra-Orthodox Sect Left Directionless by the Death of Its Leader\\", Haaretz. Retrieved 16 April 2019. and \\"radical\\".  History  = Status quo agreement = The status quo agreement, hammered out in the Knesset (Israeli parliament) informally between David Ben Gurion and the religious parties, granted draft exemptions to yeshiva students who qualified to the status of Torato Umanuto (lit. \\"His trade is Torah\\"). For many years the Torato Umanuto arrangement had the status of a regulation under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense (Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion also had the Defense portfolio). In 1998, the High Court of Justice of Israel ruled that the Defense minister had no authority to determine the extent of these exemptions. The Supreme Court postponed the application of the ruling to give the government time to resolve the matter. = Tal Law = In accordance with the judicial ruling, Prime Minister Ehud Barak set up the Tal committee in 1999. The committee reported its findings in April 2000, and its recommendations were approved by the Knesset in July 2002; the new \\"Tal Law\\", as it came to be known, was passed with 51 votes in favour and 41 against. The new law provided for a continuation of the Torato Umanuto arrangement under specific conditions laid down in the law, such as substituting a one-year civilian service instead of the 3-year military conscription. It was hoped that the number of exemptions would gradually diminish. The new law did not however put an end to controversies and disagreements. In 2005, then Justice Minister Tzipi Livni stated that the Tal Law, which by then had yet to be fully implemented, did not provide an adequate solution to the issue of Haredi conscription, as only 1,115 of the 41,450 yeshiva students covered by the arrangement had taken the \\"decision year\\" provided by the law, and of these only 31 had later enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2007 the Tal Law was extended until August 2012. In January 2012, Ehud Barak, serving as Defense Minister, said his ministry was preparing an alternative to the Tal Law. Dozens of IDF reserve soldiers had put up what they called \\"the suckers' camp\\" near the Tel Aviv Savidor Central Railway Station, to protest the possible extension of the Tal Law. Several politicians, public figures, disabled IDF veterans, and high school and university students visited the protest encampment. In February 2012, the High Court of Justice (a role of the Supreme Court of Israel) ruled that the Tal Law in its current form was unconstitutional and could not be extended beyond August. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the government would formulate a new bill that would guarantee a more equal sharing of the burden by all parts of Israeli society. The issue was also part of a possible government collapse leading into the 2012-2013 election. = Death of Yosef Shalom Elyashiv = The attitude of the Haredi community towards the outside world had historically been guided by the opinions of its gedolim (lit. \\"great ones\\", rabbinical leaders) who through their Da'as Torah were able to create consensus. The death of Yosef Shalom Elyashiv in the critical year of 2012 created a power struggle among his successors Aharon Leib Shteinman and Shmuel Auerbach surrounding the draft controversy, with the former taking a more moderate approach while the latter took a harder stance. In the end Shteinman's leadership prevailed, which led to Auerbach's founding of the Jerusalem Faction as a protest movement. = Leadership = Following the death of founder Shmuel Auerbach on 24 February 2018, a group of twelve rabbis calling themselves Council of Sages of the Torah World convened in Auerbach's former home to plan the future of the Jerusalem Faction. In particular, two disciples of Degel HaTorah political party founder Elazar Shach, dayan Tzvi Friedman of Bnei Brak and Baruch Shmuel Deutsch of Kol Torah yeshiva, appeared to have assumed joint decision making responsibilities for the group. Yisrael Yitzchak Kalmanovitz and Azriel Auerbach (brother of Shmuel) served as ideological leaders.Sharon, Jeremy (5 March 2018) \\"New Rabbinical Council of Jerusalem Faction Vows to Continue Hardline Path\\", The Jerusalem Post. Retrieved 16 April 2019.  Politics  The Jerusalem Faction runs a political party, , under the Hebrew call letters ◊¥◊¢◊•◊¥ (lit., Etz). The party claims to be the political heir of Elazar Shach, whose Degel HaTorah had in their view been compromised from its original principles. While the Faction also has a focus on threats to the Haredi education system, it mainly concerns itself with fomenting a strong opposition to the draft, which it deems a major threat to young Haredi men and women. The Faction created a Committee for Saving the Torah World to co-ordinate these activities, seeking to prevent any erosion of the status quo.Cidor, Peggy (22 July 2018) \\"Chaim Epstein: The Wild Card in the Jerusalem Mayoral Race\\", The Jerusalem Post.

A quilt is a multi-layered textile, traditionally composed of three layers of fiber: a woven cloth top, a layer of batting or wadding, and a woven back, combined using the technique of quilting, the process of sewing the three layers together. The pattern of stitching can be the key decorative element if a single piece of fabric is used for the top of a quilt (a \\"wholecloth quilt\\"), but in many cases the top is pieced from a patchwork of smaller fabric pieces; and the pattern and color of these pieces will be important to the design. Patterns, fabric, and styles differ greatly based on the time period and area that they were produced in. The quilts produced in Gee's Bend, Alabama are great examples of the history and use of quilts in specific space and time. Quilting is the process of sewing two or more layers of fabric together to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a quilt or quilted garment. The process of quilting uses a needle and thread to join two or more layers of material to make a quilt. The quilter's hand or sewing machine passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up. The process is repeated across the entire area where quilting is wanted. History =Composition= Quilting, sewing together layers of fabric to create a cohesive whole, has been around for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Europe, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States all have examples of quilts that are hundreds of years old. Depending on the time period and area that they were produced in, quilts can be made of varying textiles, have a myriad of different colors, and be pieced together using different methods. Some quilts produced in the Civil War era were created using silk ribbons. Silk material such as these ribbons often suffer from what is referred to as \\"shattering,\\" caused by metal salts that were applied to silk fabrics to create desired \\"rustles\\" in women's dresses, and were used as a weighting agent in these dresses.Benner, J. (2014). \\"Conserving Shattered Silk in an Early 20th Century Souvenir Ribbon Quilt.\\" The Denver Art Museum. The metal components do considerable damage to silk fabric over time. Quilts containing metal salts formed a minority of these objects, however, they provide an example of the types of features to be identified when considering treatment. The Minnesota Historical Society has some guidelines for preserving quilts that include insights such as looking for deterioration issues due to certain fabric types such as silk as well as specific dyes.Bede, D. (1997). Preserving Historic Quilts. Minnesota History Interpreter, 3-6. Retrieved from http://www.mnhs.org/sites/default/files/lhs/techtalk/techtalkseptember1997.pdf. In the twenty-first century, quilts are frequently displayed as non- utilitarian works of art, but historically quilts were often used as bed covers. The use of quilts as bedcovers persists today. =Processes/Techniques= After their creation, the use and production style of quilts varied; initially a utilitarian product used mostly for bed coverings, quilts have evolved to become decorative pieces as well.History of Quilts. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.quilting-in-america.com/History-of- Quilts.html Due to the changing uses of these items, techniques for creating them have evolved over the last few centuries. Some common historical and current quilting techniques include the following: * Patchwork & Piecing ** One of the primary techniques involved in quilt making is patchwork, sewing together geometric pieces of fabric often to form a design or \\"block.\\" Also called piecing, this technique can be achieved with hand stitching or with a sewing machine.International Quilt Study Center & Museum (2013). \\"Patchwork.\\" World Quilts: The American Story. Retrieved April 23, 2019. * Applique **Appliqu√© is a sewing technique where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a ground fabric. * Reverse Applique ** Reverse appliqu√© is a sewing technique where a ground fabric is cut, another piece of fabric is placed under the ground fabric, the raw edges of the ground fabric are tucked under, and the newly folded edge is sewn down to the lower fabric. Stitches are made as inconspicuous as possible. * Quilting ** Quilting, typically a running stitch, can be achieved by hand or by sewing machine. Hand quilting has often been a communally productive act with quilters sitting around a large quilting frame. * Trapunto **Trapunto is a sewing technique where two layers of fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to a portion of the design to increase the profile of relief as compared to the rest of the work. * Embellishment ** Additional decorative elements may be added to the surface of a quilt to create a three-dimensional or whimsical effect. The most common objects sewn on are beads or buttons. Decorative trim, piping, sequins, found objects, or other items can also be secured to the surface. * English Paper Piecing ** English paper piecing is a hand-sewing technique used to maximize accuracy when piecing complex angles together. A paper shape is cut with the exact dimensions of the desired piece. Fabric is then basted to the paper shape. Adjacent units are then placed face to face, and the seam is whipstitched together. When a given piece is completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the basting thread is cut, and the basting and the paper shape are removed. * Foundation Piecing **Foundation piecing is a sewing technique that allows maximum stability of the work as the piecing is created, minimizing the distorting effect of working with slender pieces or bias-cut pieces. Conservation and Restoration Science The conservation and use of all materials in a museum should be balanced to suit the object and the public. Best practices for the conservation/restoration of items start with the identification of the materials the item is constructed of. This identification allows conservation scientists to effectively treat and preserve the items for future generations. Though referred to my many names, (i.e. conservation scientists, cultural heritage scientists, etc.) these museum professionals have very specific skill sets using knowledge in physical science, forensics, the humanities, engineering, computer science, and economics. Conservation scientists use the skills they developed in these fields to conserve/restore objects from a wide array of museum areas including; statues, historical sites, paper, and textiles. As a composite textile, quilts require special consideration. The environment that they are stored in is one basic factor to consider. Being a single piece composed of possibly multiple different fabrics; all of the different fabrics' compositions need to be considered for conservation, storage, display, and treatment purposes. The large size of quilts requires special attention as well, specifically during handling, storage, and display. Due to the fragile nature of textiles, trained professionals are often the best choice to decide on the necessity of repairs and to perform them. Agents of Deterioration For the most part, all objects are susceptible to forces (agents of deterioration) that cause them to decay over the course of time through chemical, physical, biological deterioration, or some combination of the three. As with most of these objects, preventive conservation is one of the cornerstones to maintaining quilts for future generations. Through understanding the different agents of deterioration and examining the greatest threat to the objects, the museum can develop a plan to mitigate these risks. As a composite textile often containing different colors, quilts are vulnerable to light. Overexposure to light can change the colors and strength of the fabrics within them.The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). (n.d.). Caring for your Treasures. Retrieved from https://www.culturalheritage.org/website-search-results?indexCatalogue=site- search&searchQuery;=textile&wordsMode;=0 Light is not the only agent that affects textiles such as quilts; composed of organic materials, they contain carbon, are susceptible to temperature and relative humidity levels, may absorb water, and can even become homes for mold and sources of food for pests.NPS. 2012. National Park Service: Museum Handbook. Part One. Chapter 4. 4:7 ‚Äì 4:10, and, 4:16 (D) - 4:20 Quilts, and textiles in general, can be sensitive to chemicals, dust, dirt, oils, smoke, stains, perfume, and even excessive washing.Beginning Quilt Restoration. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.whitebluffscenter.org/index.php?ID=27 Susceptible to all of these agents, quilts can undergo changes that may cause discernible damage. According to the National Park Service Museum Handbook, 2012, \\"chemical changes in textiles caused by interaction with light also weaken the fabric so that physical damage such as rips and tears are more likely to occur.\\" To create more habitable environments for quilts, conservators can cycle each specimen in and out of lighted areas and storage, monitor RH and temperature levels, seal them in individual cases created for them, and more. Preventive conservation is an extremely important tool in the conservators handbook, giving them agency beyond restoration and ideally giving them more control over the natural process of deterioration that is impossible to halt completely.International Quilt Study Center & Museum Quilts Exhibition =Light= * Light is necessary to view objects in museums, but can cause quite a bit of damage if quilts are left exposed. Ultraviolet radiation and visible light can each affect textile materials such as quilts. Light can cause fading, darkening, yellowing, embrittlement, stiffening, and more. Many museums utilize motion activated lights and rotating displays to mitigate the effects of light on objects. =Relative humidity and temperature= * Relative humidity refers to the amount of moisture in the air. Fluctuations in moisture can cause textile materials to expand and contract at different rates and can also promote mold, mildew, corrosion, and bleeding of dyes. * Much as with incorrect relative humidity, the presence of water can cause mold, mildew, bleeding of dyes, and further damage to quilts. * High and low temperatures and temperature fluctuations can case damage to the different textiles in quilts. High temperatures can speed up chemical reactions and cause damage to fibers and dyes. =Pollutants= * Pollutants may be many things including dirt, grease, ash, soot, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and ozone. Many of these pollutants/contaminants may cause issues with textiles such as quilts, especially in the case of certain composite quilts or those made with silks that have metals included. Common pollutants that may affect textiles such as quilts include; sulfuric and nitric acid which react with cotton, linen, and viscose materials and can cause them to discolor and become weak and brittle.Museums Galleries Scotland - Reducing air pollution. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.museumsgalleriesscotland.org.uk/advice/collections/identifying- and-reducing-air-pollution/ =Physical forces, fire, and pests= *Physical forces can include shock, vibration, abrasion, and more that can cause cumulative damage. Quilts are often touched by visitors which can cause physical damage as well as imparting oils, creams, and salts from hands. Due to their large size, quilts require adequate support to ensure that they do not come apart under their own weight. * Thieves, Vandals, and physical forces are factors for conservators, restorers, and other museum staff to consider, especially regarding storage and presentation. *Fire can be an issue for quilts in museums as most textile materials are flammable, though storing them correctly can help keep them away from smaller fires. If quilts are exposed to fire, they can be charred, destroyed, embrittled, scorched, or even harbor smoke. * Pests, mainly insects and rodents, can damage quilts through consumption, perforation, cutting, grazing, tunneling, weakening, disfiguring, and more. Throughout history, quilts have been made of many different types of materials. If they are made of animal based, synthetic, or plant based textiles materials, different pests can be attracted to them. Most quilts are made of cotton or linen, though silk is also an option. Silverfish, carpet beetles, and moths are all common pests that can damage quilts.Museum Textile Service. (n.d.).  Pests. Retrieved from http://www.museumtextiles.com/blog/category/pests * Disassociation, often the mishandling or misfiling of objects, can become a problem especially in museums that have multiple quilts and do not keep good records on them. One could be forgotten about, not recorded as moved, or lost entirely. This quilt, created in 1884, is being held at the Brooklyn Museum. Composed of velvet and silk, this piece requires careful thought when conserving/restoring it. Preventive Conservation Direct treatment may be necessary for some objects in a museum but, for many others, preventive conservation is often considered the best course of action. Preventive conservation, sometimes called collections care, involves any actions taken to prevent or delay the deterioration of cultural heritage. The primary goal is to identify and reduce potential hazards to heritage with thoughtful control of their surroundings.Collections care. (2019, February 22). Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collections_care Preventive conservation utilizes environmental monitoring and regulation to create the ideal space for objects. The aim is to reduce deterioration; this method can be used for most items in museums including quilts.The Field Museum. (2018, June 14). Preventive Conservation. Retrieved from https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/conserving- collections/preventive-conservation If preventive conservation options run out, then treatment by a professional can commence. Conservation treatment becomes necessary when there is damage from the absence of preventive care, with improper care, other issues, or even with inherently unstable objects. =Environment= The correct storage of textiles such as quilts is important for their long-term safety. Light, temperature, and humidity are the main factors that impact a textile's deterioration rate. Pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also damage quilts in storage and display environments. Conservators monitor and evaluate museum environments to ensure the longevity of objects stored within. Besides monitoring for pests, chemicals, pollutants, light and humidity levels by themselves, these museum professionals check for any other visible signs and causes of deterioration. =Storage= Quilts and other similar textiles can be stored in more than one way. The prerequisites for all storage environments include a clean, dark, cool, and dry space with constant temperature and relative humidity. Flat storage such as shelves and drawers may be used for smaller quilts, but for larger quilts, rolled storage may become necessary. Best practices for storage of quilts include; rolling quilts around acid-free or fabric-covered tubes and storing horizontally on racks, storing them in archival-safe containers, and airing them out before storing. If utilizing other fabrics in the storage of quilts, it is common practice to boil-wash these fabrics to remove the manufacturer finish and any pollutants, as well as to soften the fabric. =Handling= The handling of textiles can vary depending on age, materials, and level of damage. If a quilt is in need of treatment, however, handling may become necessary. When handling any object, it is important to first plan ahead and make sure that the object is not being handled unnecessarily and that it is supported at all times. Best practices in the handling of textiles such as quilts involves clean cloth gloves, a clean working and display area, and the use of pencils instead of ink pens in the work area. Other physical factors may cause damage while handling a quilt; this includes snagging and pulling, uneven support, and improper movement. To reduce risks of these hazards, best practice include the following; avoiding jewelry and clothing that could snag the item, working on surfaces larger than the quilt itself, and maintaining even support through the process of transportation. =Display/Exhibition= As with handling and storage, environmental factors need to be taken into account when displaying quilts and textiles. Though each individual item will need to be examined and treated based on its individual needs, there are some commonalities between them that museums take into account when putting them in exhibitions. According to the International Quilt Study Center & Museum, quilts are displayed for one out of ten years total, though not necessarily consecutively. This \\"minimizes the amount of light exposure and reduces the wear and tear from hanging on display.\\" A majority of quilts are put on display using cord suspension systems and often have cotton sleeves attached to reduce stress to the fibers. =Maintenance/Housekeeping= Before any maintenance or housekeeping can take place, conservators first examine the quilt to decide on the best course of action moving forward. Vacuuming, wet cleaning, dry cleaning, steaming, and ironing are possible methods of maintenance of quilts. Vacuuming is often considered one of the least invasive and easiest ways to clean a quilt and allows dirt and dust to be removed in a minimally-invasive way. As wet cleaning is more invasive than vacuuming, best practices recommend it only be used when necessary. Understanding the chemical composition, characteristics of the fibers, which dyes were used, and what soils are present is important before using any wet-cleaning methods on the quilt. Conservation Treatment In terms of restoring museum objects, buildings, textiles, etc., treatment refers to more than just the physical processes used to bring these items back to their original state. Treatment is the process from assessment and analysis to the physical work to restore the item. Often called interventive conservation, this \\"refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object.\\"Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. (2019, April 02). Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_cultural_heritage#Interventive_conservation Interventive treatment can be done for \\"aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity.\\" Preventive conservation is commonly preferred over treatment, but treatment can become necessary. Staff, including the conservator, the curator, designer, and other professionals communicate to decide if treatment is the most viable option. Textile Conservators have a big part in quilt restoration and conservation. The International Quilt Study Center & Museum notes that \\"using tools like microscopes, magnifying lenses, and high-resolution digital cameras to closely examine antique quilts and textiles can reveal a great deal about their past and help us determine the best way to safeguard them - and other textiles like them - for the future.\\" Though all treatment can be said to be irreversible, unnecessary and excessive treatment can be especially damaging. When it comes to actually performing treatments on textiles such as quilts, some aspects can be performed by non-professionals: preparing storage, vacuuming, etc. However, according to the National Park Service, conservators must perform the interventive treatments such as \\"wet and dry cleaning, repair using needle and thread techniques, consolidation with adhesives, application of linings, restoration and reconstructions\\" and more.NPS. 2002. National Park Service: Museum Handbook. Appendix K: Curatorial Care of Textile Objects Keeping quilts free of dust and pests are great preventive conservation techniques, but may also be considered treatment. To clean a textile such as a quilt, you can vacuum the surface, clean with wet or dry means, or spot treat. As quilts are composite textiles sewn together with thread, a needle and thread may be used to repair them as well - to close seams and provide support. Depending on the specific type of fabric that composes the quilt (inorganic textiles such as silk vs. organic textiles such as cotton), a needle may not be effective or may cause excessive damage. In cases such as this, adhesives may be used to repair/treat the affected area.

Her work met with critical esteem during the 1920s, when she exhibited actively, but it has since been largely forgotten.  Life  Monnier was born in Paris, during the final decade of the nineteenth century, to parents Clovis and Philiberte (n√©e Sollier). Monnier was married to painter and printmaker Paul-Emile B√©cat. Her elder sister, Andrienne Monnier, was the proprietor of the famous Parisian bookstore, La Maison des Amis des Livres.  Work and Critical Reception  Marie Monnier exhibited her embroideries in Paris at La Maison des Amis des Livres and Galerie E. Druet during the 1920s to the acclaim of critics and writers including Paul Val√©ry and L√©on-Paul Fargue. She contributed illustrations to editions of Fargue‚Äôs collection Ludions (1930) as well as Paul Val√©ry‚Äôs Moralit√©s (1931). Val√©ry‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúLes Broderies de Marie Monnier‚Äù opened the catalog for her 1924 exhibition at Galerie E. Druet (then managed by Eugene Druet's widow), which included her illustrations for his ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAbeille and ‚ÄúPalme,‚Äù Arthur Rimbaud‚Äôs ‚ÄúLes Chercheuses de poux,‚Äù and Fargue‚Äôs ‚ÄúF√©erie.‚Äù In that essay, Val√©ry described her work thus: > Look at the marvelous coloring of these panels. They have a brilliance akin > to life's rosiest products‚Äìinsects' wings, birds' feathers, shells, petals. > No painting can match the force or delicacy that appears in these subtle > associations of bits of dyed silk.

Transition‚Äôs editors included a biographical note esteeming Monnier: \\"To call the work of MARIE MONNIER ‚Äòembroidery‚Äô is inadequate and unjust. Her compositions are magnificently organized but, because of her unique medium, she is able to use colors and textures which are denied a painter in oils and watercolors.‚Äù They added that her current exhibition at La Maison des Amis des Livres had ‚Äúastonished art lovers of Paris,‚Äù and that her patient sensibility in her craft stood as a ‚Äúdeliberate artistic undercurrent beneath the apparent restlessness and confusion of the age.Monnier, Marie.

In his essay ‚ÄúBroderies,‚Äù published in La Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise in June 1927, Fargue similarly praised Monnier‚Äôs art at length. Describing his encounter with her embroideries on exhibit La Maison des Amis des Livres, he wrote, > There was a singular vibration, a lucig√®ne [related to a type of oil lamp] > state (first aspect of the sun across flowers, leaves, the work of insects). > No pigment heaviness.

Digital mediums are growing rapidly to compete with books as the superior means of communication. Needing to meet the current needs of society, educational leaders are aware that there is a growing need to change the current practices and make a shift towards incorporating more technology into the classroom. Digital media in education refers to the use of interactive multimedia in the classroom setting.Kraidy, Ute (2002-10-01). \\"Digital Media and Education: cognitive impact of information visualization\\". Journal of Educational Media. 27 (3): 95‚Äì106. doi:10.1080/1358165020270302. ISSN 1358-1651. Digital media in education involves the processes of incorporating digital media, such as specific software, mobile devices as a tool for learning, and many other things.  How Digital Media Creates Voice  Digital media can take several different forms in terms of creating voice, such as email, video, websites, photos, and slideshows. Emails allow direct communication with a student and teacher outside the classroom. Students can have dialogue at any time with their professors on problems or questions they are having. In a study done by Alison Cook-Sather, students tend to be more comfortable with communicating by e-mail. It has the effect of socially leveling the student and teacher. Through visual presentations students and professors can put forth their information with video and photo. Showcasing their topic through video and photo has become a major theme in the classroom. For example, in an article by Jon M. Wargo and Kara Clayton, U.S. secondary students amplified by a global political climate of fear, oppression, and increased nationalism, used multimodal composition, and video production in particular, as a means to participate in politics and voice their opinion.Wargo, Jon M., and Kara Clayton. \\"From PSAs to Reel Communities: Exploring the Sounds and Silences of Urban Youth Mobilizing Digital Media Production.\\" Learning, Media & Technology, vol. 43, no. 4, Dec. 2018, pp. 469‚Äì484. EBSCOhost, . Through video production they were able to create a message and display it to a larger audience. The study showed that presenting information in the form of a video production increased student interactions amongst each other and themselves, and amplified youth voice. Students felt more in control of their work, and production process allowed for them to voice their own opinions. Through the internet and websites students, professors, and anyone can obtain information on any subject. Digital media allows students and teachers to advance communication techniques.  Opportunity through digital media  Digital media allows people to showcase their work, social standpoints, and more. Student‚Äôs work can reach a larger crowd and receive comments and opinions. Reddit, YouTube, Vimeo, pages like these allow public display of anyone‚Äôs ideas and work. This feedback also gives students perception on how there work will be received in the real world. Students looking for work or internships to strengthen their resum√© also will find opportunity online through sites such as Linkedin. Linkedin is a social networking site that allows one to network and to build their professional portfolio. It also enables anyone to search for job opportunities.  How digital media is being incorporated into education  The use of digital media in education allows students to access more useful information, communicate, find opportunity, or join learning groups. As time has passed different forms of digital media, such as laptops, video, and online research have been incorporated into daily education. New programs and classes are being added to curriculum every year. For instance, the University of Connecticut launched a digital media and design major in 2015. This includes various classes such as web design, digital culture, animation, and more. Next year they will be offering a video and film concentration.  Digital Media Literacy  Even though there is no exact definition of media literacy, it can be closely defined as the ability to decode information from digital media, take meaning from it, and adequately communicate the idea to others. Media literacy is a practice that allows people to access, critically evaluate, and create media. Information presented in the form of digital media is absorbed and expressed differently than when in the form of traditional media.Huntington, Heidi (2011). \\"Digital Media in Education: Expanding the Technology Acceptance Model\\". Rochester Institute of Technology ‚Äì via ProQuest. Evidently, literacy has always been a form of social power. Even though not everyone has the accessibility and opportunity to engage in such practices, the world of today is saturated with digital media. It is important to implement these technological changes into the education system to prepare individuals to be engaged in political, social and economic aspects of society.Kellner, D, Douglas, J (2007). \\"Critical Media Literacy, Democracy, and the Reconstruction of Education\\". Media literacy: A reader. Due to this, it is crucial for education systems to examine distinct forms of teaching and provide the appropriate resources and knowledge for the contemporary world. One of the reasons why digital media literacy is taught is because our society is becoming increasingly saturated with media content and messaging.Koltay, Tibor (2011-03-23). \\"The media and the literacies: media literacy, information literacy, digital literacy:\\". Media, Culture & Society. doi:10.1177/0163443710393382. Media contains messaging that can influence perceptions, beliefs and attitudes, and digital media literacy education teaches students how to discern messaging techniques. In education, media literacy encourages students to ask questions about what they watch, hear, and read. These questions might address source bias, reliability, and authority.Buckingham, David (2015). \\"Defining digital literacy-What do young people need to know about digital media?\\". Nordic Journal of Digital Literacy. 2006-2016: 25 ‚Äì via Idunn. Engagement with media platforms such as blogs, websites and podcasts are key to creating a cooperative education environment. \\"Cooperative education takes seriously the social and reciprocal nature of teaching and learning. It empowers teachers to relinquish authoritarian control, and encourages them to weave their expertise into the community of learning that emerges dynamically in the courses they teach.\\" Long, Christopher P. (December 2010). \\"Cultivating Communities of Learning with Digital Media: Cooperative Education through Blogging and Podcasting\\". Teaching Philosophy: 361. Media literacy also involves the ability of students to understand strategy to market media. Understanding trends, keywords, timing, and more assets that allow successful marketing. Media literacy is a major focus in the Digital Media in Business Education concentration study. A student coding for a web design class.  Benefits of Digital Media in an Education Context  There are many benefits that digital media provides in an educational context. Firstly, It can increase student engagement. Unlike other mediums, when one is working on digital assignments, students ate able to act as a producer. In addition, it helps students work through difficult concepts. Digital instruction helps show difficult topics that are often hard to understand. In addition, the use of digital media In education helps to promote critical awareness. Lastly, digital media also helps foster equality. When students use digital technology in a course, all the students in the classroom have the opportunity to hone those digital skills.  Implication of Digital Media in Education  There are two main implications for this practice. First, it allows teachers and students the opportunity to engage in dialogue based on mutual respect and reciprocity. Secondly, there is a link between the virtual and the actual based on the fundamental human relationship at the foundation of all teaching and learning  References  Digital media Educational technology ","title":"Digital media in education"},{"id":"60513833","text":"K√∂ppen climate types in Ohio now showing majority as humid subtropical. Climate change in Ohio is of concern due to its impacts on the environment, people, and economy of Ohio. The annual mean temperature in Ohio has increased by about 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit (.7 degrees Celsius) since 1895. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, \\"All regions of Ohio have warmed.\\" Effects of climate change in Ohio =Temperature= Higher average annual temperatures will increase the incidence of heatwaves. \\"Northern cities like Cleveland are vulnerable to heat waves, because many houses and apartments lack air conditioning, and urban areas are typically warmer than their rural surroundings.\\" If current emissions trends continue, \\"Cincinnati would face at least two heat waves per summer like the one that killed hundreds in Chicago in 1995. Cleveland would face at least one.\\" A publication by the Climate System Research Center of the University of Massachusetts Amherst projects that, under the higher emissions scenario where global average temperature increases by 4.0-6.1 degrees Celsius, Cincinnati, Ohio would experience over 80 days a year with temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and 29 days a year over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. =Precipitation= Ohio, along with the rest of the Midwest, experienced a 37% increase in the amount of precipitation falling in multi-day precipitation events from 1958 to 2012. Ohio will experience greater amounts of precipitation, but less snowfall in the winter due to the higher temperatures. Accordingly, the risk of flooding in Ohio is due to increase. Greater heavy rainfall in the Midwest are leading to soil erosion and nutrient loss. =Agriculture= Severe droughts would hurt crop yields. \\"In rural Ohio, ozone levels are high enough to significantly reduce yields of soybeans and winter wheat.\\" Climate change may have some benefits in certain respects, however. \\"Longer frost-free growing seasons and higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide would increase yields for some crops during an average year.\\" =Ecosystems= Changing temperatures will affect which plant species survive in Ohio. \\"Species that prefer cool soils like Eastern hemlock will find fewer and fewer suitable locations to survive.\\" =The Great Lakes= Lake Erie in January 2014. Ice cover \\"on the Great Lakes is forming later or melting sooner.\\" \\"Between 1994 and 2011, reduced ice cover lengthened the shipping season on the lakes by eight days. The Great Lakes are likely to warm another 3¬∞ to 7¬∞F in the next 70 years, which will further extend the shipping season.\\" Higher water temperature leads to greater algae blooms. Worsening storms also increase run-off into the Great Lakes, and overflow of sewers into the Great Lakes, worsening water quality. =Disease= Areas in Ohio are potentially vulnerable to \\"formerly tropical illnesses\\" like Zika and West Nile making their way into the state. Tickborne Diseases (spread by ticks) are an increasing concern in Ohio too as it has been one of the frequently suffered disease. Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is also known common. Adaptation to climate change in Ohio Ohio has not adopted or developed a statewide adaptation plan, though local governments like Cleveland and Columbus have. =Proposed adaptations= Due to things like stronger storms, worsening droughts, and higher incidence of \\"mold toxins, like aflatoxin in corn, soy, and small grain crops,\\" farmers in Ohio \\"will need to adapt by developing new cropping schedules and different crop choices.\\" Changes in fertilizer management are needed to address elevated phosphorus in agricultural runoff in the Maumee River watershed, which contributes to toxic algae blooms of cyanobacteria in Lake Erie. While spring rainfall and average precipitation are going to increase, droughts in summer are likely to worsen. Drier times would require irrigation to make up for moisture loss, driving up food costs. The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center of Ohio State University published a report, the \\"Columbus Climate Adaptation Plan,\\" which includes a list of proposed actions to adapt and respond to climate change in Central Ohio. Ohio State University held its first Climate Change Symposium in March 2019. Greenhouse gas emissions in Ohio \\"Ohio is the fourth largest producer of global warming emissions among all the states,\\" with per capita emissions nearly \\"19 percent higher than the national average.\\" This is \\"mainly because 87 percent of Ohio‚Äôs electricity comes from coal-fired power plants (compared with the national average of 50 percent).\\" Electricity generation accounts for 49% of greenhouse gas emissions in Ohio, followed by 26% from transportation and 14% from industry.

The churches were founded in 1914 by minister William Sowders (1879-1952).  Origins  The beginnings of Gospel Assemblies may be traced to Paducah, Kentucky in 1914. Sowders, a former Louisville policeman,Watchman Fellowship Profile: Gospel Assembly Church evangelized primarily in the lower Ohio River valley region, settling in Louisville, where he established a congregation and ministered there until his death in 1952.Watchman Fellowship Profile: Gospel Assembly Church Sowders' designated successor, T. M. Jolly, ministered in St. Louis until 1991. Doctrine Like other evangelical denominations, Gospel Assembly churches believe the Bible to be the pure Word of God. Members utilize the term 'the Body of Christ' to refer to their fellowship exclusively, and 'Babylon' to refer to the remainder of the church world. They consider their movement to represent a restoration of the early church.https://www.watchman.org/profiles/pdf/gospelassemblychurchprofile.pdf No formal doctrinal statement is published because they consider themselves to be continually growing in the grace and knowledge of the Lord. However, they are distinctly nontrinitarian. Like most churches, primary worship services are traditionally held on Sundays, however, most often they are in the early afternoon, in a departure from standard practice.Gospel Assembly Church Indianapolis - ScheduleGodfrey Gospel Tabernacle - Godfrey, IL They believe in spiritual communion, meaning that their communion takes place over the fellowship of the Word of God, and therefore do not practice the literal Lord's Supper with the elements. Certain factions of the fellowship have likewise moved away from practicing literal water baptism as an outward ritual, and instead, emphasize the spiritual aspect of the ordinances. Order and practice Gospel Assemblies is Pentecostal by experience. They ascribe to holiness as the result of a sanctified heart, expressed in standards of speech and demeanor, modest dress, and a lifestyle of humility and moderation.http://gospelassemblyfree.com/gac/photo.html Music is orchestral- based, with many of their published hymns and choruses having been written by their own members, particularly; Ruth Wetherington, John W.

Albert, Norma Wilson, Mable Schofield, Michael T. Laramore, Beverly Raffield, Bernard Lewis, Lydia Oeschleager, Rachel Martin, Cynthia Leech, Matthew Beckley, Carol Anderson, Jim Fairhurst, Sandra Blackwell and Doris Daves. Their worship services are conducted in 'open-order' fashion, somewhat similar to Quaker worship services, encouraging active participation by the congregation in music and in the ministry of the Word, as led by the spirit of God.

His research on the fossil records of mammals also founded examination into the period after the arrival of humans and their role within the ecology of the Australian continent. His excavations and research into mammalian palaeontology also included description of unknown species of extinct marsupials.  Biography  Merrilees was born in Sydney and graduated from the city's university with a degree in chemistry in 1942. His qualifications saw him deployed during the Second World War to a Tasmanian wood pulping industry. His interest was drawn at this time to the study of igneous rock and then to the examination of fossilised mammals. He moved to Western Australia in 1951, after discontinuing a teaching career, and began lecturing in scientific literacy at the University of Western Australia. An overlapping role with the works of the Western Australian Museum was eventually altered to a full time position of curator of the palaeontology, mineral and meteorite collections. His major focus in palaeontology was what he referred to as the \\"large extinct marsupials\\". He retired to a location near Manjimup in the southwest of Australia.  Works  Amongst the works reporting the findings of excavations at fossil sites and study of the museum's specimens, Merrilees published a thesis on the impact of human practices introduced to the environment. In his proposed model of ecological changes after the first arrival of humans, the disappearance of megafauna as a direct consequence of their activities in Australia is comparable to Quaternary extinction events on other continents. Merrilees presented his research and conclusions, conducted under the supervision of W. D. L. Ride, in his presidential address to the Royal Society of Western Australia in 1967. The archaeological sites he examined includes Devils Lair during 1970, an important source of fossilised material, in collaboration with Charles Dortch. His conservation activities were associated with a personal interest in farming, and in overseeing an official program of semi-cleared land purchase that sought to both enhance the agricultural potential and rehabilitation of bushland to its previous state. Twenty-four papers were published with his professional contributions; a further six articles were authored as non-scientific works. He described two extinct species of Sthenurus, a kangaroo-like marsupial. According to the anonymous author of the obituary issued by his museum, Merrilees insisted on being listed in alphabetical order in the credits of papers he wrote with other, less senior, authors to elevate their name in the citations. Forty volumes of his field notes from archaeological sites around Australia are held at his museum's library.

An excised piece of smooth muscle tissue is held in an oxygenated solution in a chamber. The tissue is attached to a lever, which transmits its contraction to a myograph, thus recording the physiological response. Drugs under investigation can be administered directly to the chamber An organ chamber, organ bath, or isolated tissue bath is a chamber in which isolated organs or tissues can be administered with drugs, or stimulated electrically, in order to measure their function. The tissue in the organ bath is typically oxygenated with carbogen and kept in a solution such as Tyrode's solution or lactated Ringer's solution. Historically, they have also been called gut baths. It is used in pharmacology research, particularly when studying the contraction of smooth muscle in tissues such as ileum, colon, vas deferens, trachea, bladder, corpus cavernosum, and blood vessels such as aortic rings. The contraction of smooth muscle tissues can be readily measured with a myograph; this type of physiological response is more readily quantifiable than that of other tissues. Organ baths were originally developed to study the effects of agonists and antagonists on excitable tissues, such as nervous tissue and muscle though they have been adapted to study tissues such as epithelium. Typical tissues and receptors studied with organ bath preparations include nicotinic, muscarinic and histamine receptors in the ileum or beta adrenoceptors in the bladder. Tissues are typically taken from rodents, such as guinea pigs, mice and rats. For studying the effects of drugs on receptors in drug discovery and combinatorial chemistry, novel techniques such as high throughput screening, ultrahigh throughput screening and high content screening, pharmacogenomics, proteomics and array technology have largely superseded the use of organ baths. These techniques can allow more receptor specificity than organ bath preparations, as a single tissue sample can express many different receptor types. The use of organ bath preparations for the measurement of physiological tissue responses to drug concentrations allows the generation of dose response curves. This in turn allows the quantification of a drug's pharmacological profile in the tissue in question, such as the calculation of the drug's EC50, IC50, and Hill coefficient. Historical contributions Examples of important contributions made using this technique include: *The 1921 discovery by Otto Loewi of Vagusstoff using frog hearts resulted in the identification of acetylcholine as the first neurotransmitter. *Enkephalin using bioassays such as the mouse vas deferens as a bioassay. *Nitric oxide using both assays of bull retractor penis and aortic ring.

She won election to that office after defeating incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 Chicago aldermanic elections. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.  Early life, education, and career  Rodriguez-Sanchez was born in Humacao, Puerto Rico in 1978. Her father was a community organizer, and Rodriguez- Sanchez cites attending a protest against the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station's practice of diverting water from her community as one of her earliest moments of political consciousness. She received a Bachelor‚Äôs in Theater Education from the University of Puerto Rico at R√≠o Piedras in 2003, as well as a Master‚Äôs in Applied Theater from the University of Manchester in 2007. Rodriguez-Sanchez worked as a drama teacher in Puerto Rico before austerity cuts to public education on the island led her to move to Albany Park, Chicago and accept the position of Resident Director of the Albany Park Theater Project. While working with APTP to create community theater that reflected the daily struggles of people in working-class, largely immigrant community, Rodriguez-Sanchez became involved with the Immigrant Youth Justice League, an organization led by undocumented youth to combat deportations.

Rodriguez-Sanchez placed first in the February 26, 2019 general election with 42.1% of the vote, advancing to a head-to-head runoff with the incumbent Deb Mell. She then won the April 2, 2019 runoff election by 13 votes, ending nearly 44 years of Mell family control of the 33rd Ward seat. = Aldermanic career = Rodriguez Sanchez assumed office as a member of Chicago City Council on May 20, 2019, and is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform, and Latino Caucuses.

The monastery now belongs to the Franciscan order. The church is in a region of the national nature preserve of Parco regionale dell'Abbazia di Monteveglio.  History  A church and monastery at this site were probably first erected before the 9th-century, as reflected by portions of the crypt and apse; but the present brick Romanesque structures were built mainly between the 11th and 12th centuries. The monastery was likely expanded in the 11th-century under the patronage of Matilde di Canossa, and assigned to the Order of Canons Regular of San Frediano di Lucca. In 1455, this order was replaced by the Canons Regular of the Lateran, also an Augustinian order. In 1796, the monastery was suppressed by the Napoleonic forces. After various changes of hand, the convent now houses Franciscan friars. The abbey underwent restoration during 1925-1934 under Giuseppe Rivani.

The helmet is made of Polyamide Plastic. It is designed with double- layered plastic cladding that are overlapped, foam lining, and mesh fabric on the inside. As it is not bulletproof, its main purpose is as a helmet for training exercises. It does however protect the user against explosive fragments.

After suffering heavy losses the UN abandoned the positions. Background From 26 to 30 March 1953 the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) had mounted a series of attacks on the US 1st Marine Division outpost positions north of the Jamestown Line, US I Corps' Main line of resistance (MLR) known as the Nevada Complex. The Nevada Complex was located on low hills, approximately northeast of Panmunjom and the same distance north of Munsan-ni. The PVA had seized Outpost Reno, but had been pushed back from Outpost Vegas and both sides had suffered heavy losses in the battle. In early May 1953 the US 25th Infantry Division moved to the US I Corps zone in exchange for the US 2nd Infantry Division, it had relieved the US 1st Marine Division on the frontline. 25th Division commander General Samuel Tankersley Williams assigned the responsibility for the defense of the Nevada Complex and neighboring outposts, Berlin and East Berlin, to the attached Turkish Brigade under Brig. Gen. Sirri Acar on 5 May. Facing the Turkish forces were the three Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) regiments, the 358th, 359th and 360th of the 120th Division, 46th Army. Since the PVA seizure of Outpost Reno in March, the area had remained quiet except for the customary probes and patrols. But the PVA capability of mounting a large-scale attack upon the Nevada Complex Outposts: Vegas, Elko and Carson and other nearby hills posed a constant threat that demanded constant vigilance. Tactically, possession of the Nevada Complex by the PVA would mean improved observation of the Jamestown Line. Since I Corps regarded these defensive positions as critical, the Turkish forces were instructed to hold them against all PVA attacks. This promised to be a difficult task if the PVA were determined to take the outposts, for they were at a considerable distance from the MLR and the PVA's approach routes were easier than those of I Corps. Battle On 25 May, after the UN Command had made its final offer at the Panmunjom truce talks, the PVA artillery began to open up on the Nevada Complex. For the next three days the shells came in with growing frequency and PVA troop movements in the area increased. General Acar secured artillery support from I Corps and the 1st Marine Division artillery, in addition to that which the 25th Division could provide, to counter the PVA concentrations. From the Marine 1st Tank Battalion, 34 tanks rolled into position to funnel direct fire support to the outposts. When the first attack came on the evening of 28 May, the Turkish units defending the outposts were well dug in and adequately armed. Barbed wire, trip flares, and mines were in place and automatic weapons sited to cover the enemy approach routes. There were 140 men at Vegas, 44 at Carson, 33 at Elko, 27 at Berlin, and 16 at East Berlin. Following an intense artillery and mortar preparation, the 120th Division sent four battalions forward, two to the east against the main objective, Vegas, one to the south against Carson and Elko, and one in a diversionary attack against Berlin and East Berlin. The diversionary attack was halted and broken off early in the evening. On Vegas the PVA succeeded in taking one small finger of the hill and clung tenaciously despite the heavy automatic weapons, small arms, artillery, and mortar fire at them. The Turks sent a reinforcing platoon in to bolster the defenders and it arrived in time to help throw back a three-pronged PVA assault on the outpost. After reorganizing, the PVA again sent a force estimated at two battalions to take the position. Ammunition began to run low and the Turkish 2nd Battalion commander sent another platoon accompanied by Korean Service Corps personnel to resupply the embattled troops. After a brief respite in the fighting, the PVA tried again and this time they pushed through and hand-to-hand combat broke out in the trenches. Meanwhile, the PVA had added a second battalion to the assault on Carson and Elko and closed upon the Turkish positions. Bayonets and hand grenades were used freely as the Turks managed to repel the attack. The battalion commander sent an engineer platoon, then committed the rest of the engineer company to the defense of Carson. Shortly after midnight the pace slackened, but observers reported that a third PVA battalion was assembling to join in the assault. Fire support from the 1st Battalion of the Turkish force and the US 35th Infantry Regiment helped to disperse this reinforcing PVA battalion. As the night wore on, Elko held out against continuing PVA attacks, but the Turkish soldiers on Carson were being gradually eliminated. A few managed to slip over and join their comrades on Elko, but the majority died in the trenches and bunkers from PVA fire. By morning Carson belonged to the PVA. Convinced of the PVA determination to take the Nevada Complex, General Williams placed the US 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment under General Acar so that he could commit his reserves to the counterattack. However the PVA gradually gained control of the northwest portion of Vegas and Turkish casualties were increasing. In a desperate effort to blunt the PVA drive, the Turks began a counterattack to clear the hill and they slowly swept the PVA off of Vegas. Undaunted, the PVA regrouped and reinforced their offensive units, then came back again. The edged their way up Vegas and met the Turks, who refused to move. Late in the morning of 29 May, the Turks launched a four- platoon attack that cleared Vegas. But the PVA in turn would not accept defeat and sent wave after wave of men against the Turkish positions, as casualties on both sides increased sharply. On Elko the battle continued throughout of the night of 28‚Äì29 May, as the PVA increased the pressure against the remnants of the Turkish force on the hill. General Acar ordered Lt. Col. Carl E. Mann, the commander of the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry, to send one of his companies to reinforce Elko and to retake Carson on the morning of 29 May. Company B approached Elko from the southeast, overran the PVA around the outpost, and secured the objective after a 25-minute fight. Using two platoons in the attack and two in the support roles, Company B then advanced west on Carson. Midway between Elko and Carson, the company began to receive heavy automatic weapons, artillery, and mortar fire, and the assault slowed, then halted. Withdrawing to Elko, Company B tried twice to gather momentum enough to break through the PVA wall of fire on Carson. Each time it failed and had to turn back. UN artillery, mortars and automatic weapons could not silence the PVA weapons nor dislodge the defenders. After the third assault ground to a halt, the PVA retaliated. Six times they crossed from Carson to Elko and on several occasions managed to advance within hand grenade range. Company B, supported by artillery, tank, mortar and automatic weapons fire, forced the PVA to break off the attack each time and Elko remained in UN possession. Aftermath By mid-afternoon on 29 May, General Williams and I Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Bruce C. Clarke evidently felt that the Chinese intended to remain on the offensive until the outposts were taken. UN strength on Vegas was down to approximately 40 men, many of them wounded, and to 20 on Elko. Over 150 men had been killed and 245 had been wounded in the defense of the Nevada Complex. On the other hand, the PVA casualties were estimated at 3,000 men. The question was should the UN Command hang on to the outposts while the losses on both sides mounted, or should the terrain be evacuated and more UN lives be conserved? Under the circumstances the commanders decided that the outposts had served their main purpose in uncovering and delaying the PVA attack. Early in the evening of 29 May orders went out for the Turks to withdraw from Vegas and for the US troops to leave Elko. It had been a bitter struggle as the losses on each side attested. Over 117,000 rounds of artillery fire and 67 close air support missions had aided the UN ground units in withstanding the determined assaults of the PVA. The PVA had sent 65,000 rounds of artillery and mortar fire in return, up to this point an unprecedented volume in the Korean War. The tenacity of the PVA attack following the submission of the UNC 25 May proposal at Panmunjom indicated that the PVA were beginning to jockey for improved positions along the front in anticipation of an armistice. Undeterred apparently by the casualties incurred, the Chinese now seemed ready to use personnel and carefully hoarded supplies of ammunition with a free hand as the negotiations entered the final phase.

Pennington seems to have been frequently at odds with his fellow officers: his arrival in America was signalized by a duel with the Royal Navy captain who brought him over, and in 1793, he was publicly reprimanded by the Duke of York for court-martialing an adjutant over a trifle. After thirty years of service in the Coldstream Guards, he received the colonelcy of the 131st Regiment of Foot in 1795, only for it to be disbanded the next year. He married late in life, in 1802, and promptly had one son. His last command was a Royal Veteran Battalion in 1806, which he resigned in 1813 upon inheriting his brother's barony and estates, dying five years later. Early life Pennington was the third son of Sir Joseph Pennington, 4th Baronet, and his wife Sarah. The Penningtons were an old Cumberland family, seated at Muncaster Castle since 1208. He was commissioned an ensign in the Coldstream Guards on 4 November 1764, and would serve with the regiment for the next thirty years. He was promoted lieutenant on 20 October 1772. American Revolution Pennington was ordered to join the Guards detachment serving in America in July 1777. His friend Sir Willoughby Aston, 6th Baronet, recommended that he take passage to New York City aboard HMS Zebra; Zebra's new captain, Hon. John Tollemache, had married Aston's sister-in-law. The experience proved unfortunate. Tollemache and Pennington fell out during the voyage, to a degree that provoked a duel. The duel was fought on the night of their arrival, at Hull's Tavern. Contemporary journals, the New-York Gazette and Rivington's Gazette, reported that Tollemache was killed by a single thrust through the breast, while Pennington sustained multiple wounds. A contemporary letter by Horace Walpole, presumably reflecting the report of the time, attributes the quarrel to \\"humming a tune\\". Pennington was brought before a general court-martial in Philadelphia on December 15 to be tried for murder in Tollemache's death. Aston, Pennington, and his fellow-passenger Capt. Primrose Kennedy all testified that Tollemache had verbally abused Pennington during the voyage, and expressed a desire to kill him in a duel. Pennington's absent-minded humming after dinner was said by Kennedy to have produced a particular outburst from Tollemache. The court- martial acquitted Pennington of murder. Later accounts of the event became more fanciful, relating that Pennington and Tollemache exchanged fire with a brace of pistols before resorting to smallswords, and attributing the quarrel to a sonnet made by Pennington on Tollemache's wife; these embellishments do not appear to be supported by contemporary accounts. Pennington was promoted to captain of a company in the Guards, succeeding Wadham Wyndham, on 14 December 1778. He sat on the board of enquiry investigating the Battle of Paulus Hook. At the Battle of Young's House on 8 February 1780, Pennington brought up a party of grenadiers to reinforce the troops engaged, following which Young's house was successfully stormed. During the Guards' campaign in the south, Pennington commanded the grenadier company of the 1st Battalion. He was given leave by Cornwallis to go from Suffolk, Virginia to New York on 16 July 1781. He thereby escaped the capitulation at Yorktown. He brought with him a servant named Abraham, formerly a slave owned by Peter Rose. Pennington returned from America in November 1781. French Revolutionary Wars He was promoted to second major of the Coldstream Guards on 1 February 1793. He commanded the 1st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards during the Flanders Campaign. At the Battle of Raismes on 8 May 1793, he led the battalion against La Marli√®re's division, driving them from the forest of Vicoigne and back to their entrenchments. However, his attempt to storm that position was repelled with heavy losses. Pennington displayed an irascible temper throughout the campaign, which steadily worsened and markedly impaired his relations with the other Guards officers. During the Siege of Valenciennes, matters came to a head when he requested the court-martial of Captain Wynyard of the Coldstream Guards, an equerry to the Duke of York, over a triviality. The Duke let the court-martial proceed, to avoid accusations of favoritism; Wynyard was honourably acquitted, and the Duke, who thought Pennington \\"perfectly mad\\", excoriated him before the other officers afterward. Nonetheless, he was favourably recognized by the Duke, together with the other Guards commanders, for his gallantry in leading the Coldstream Guards at the Battle of Lincelles the following month. On 20 December 1793, he was promoted to the rank of major-general. On 1 April 1795, he was promoted to first major of the Coldstream Guards. On 23 June 1795, he was appointed colonel of the 131st Regiment of Foot. The regiment was disbanded in 1796, and Pennington went on half-pay. Later life and family On 29 June 1799, Pennington was promoted to lieutenant-general. On 13 January 1802, he married Esther, the widow of Capt. James Morrison and daughter of Thomas Barry. They had one child, Lowther Augustus John Pennington (1802‚Äì1838). In 1806, he was appointed colonel of the 10th Royal Veteran Battalion, raised to provide garrison troops in Canada, and on 25 April 1808, he was promoted to general. In 1813, he succeeded his elder brother as Baron Muncaster by special remainder, and to the family estates in Cumberland and Yorkshire, subsequently resigning his colonelcy. He died in 1818 in his house at Grosvenor Place, and was succeeded by his only son, Lowther.

The HouseGuests try to avoid eviction with the aim of being the last remaining HouseGuest in order to win a grand prize of $250,000. Prior to the season finale the viewers were able to vote for their favorite HouseGuest of the season thereby awarding them the title America's Favorite HouseGuest and a prize of $25,000. During their time inside the Big Brother House the HouseGuests would periodically take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who would win safety and power. The winner of the Head of Household competition was immune from nominations and was instructed to nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest became Head of Household, he or she was ineligible to take part in the next Head of Household competition. The winner of the Power of Veto competition won the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction. If the Veto winner exercised the power, the Head of Household then had to nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. On eviction night, all HouseGuests except for the Head of Household and the nominees voted to evict one of the nominees. This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room by the host and in the event of a tie, the Head of Household would break the tie and reveal their vote in front of the other HouseGuests.

In the first twist the HouseGuests discovered that Anthony Scaramucci was a fake HouseGuest and he subsequently left the House on Day 6. The second twist allowed the viewers to give one HouseGuest a new power called the Power of the Publicist and granted the holder of this title the ability to save themselves from eviction from Days 14‚Äì20. The viewers were able to vote for the HouseGuest they wanted to receive this power by posting a tweet that included a specific hashtag created by CBS that corresponded with the HouseGuest's name. Tamar won the power but never used it because she was not nominated for eviction. The third and final twist was revealed to be a safety competition on Day 24. The winner won immunity from the double eviction, but was ineligible to become Head of Household. Tamar won the competition. During the first twenty-four days Jonathan, Ryan, Joey, Kato, Natalie and Tom evicted from the game. Kandi became the seventh evictee during the live season finale on Day 29. Ricky won the final Head of Household competition guaranteeing his spot as a finalist. He then chose to evict Dina and Lolo which made Tamar the other finalist. The nine evicted HouseGuests then voted on who should win the season with Tamar winning with a unanimous vote and receiving the grand prize. Ricky became the runner-up after receiving zero votes to win and was awarded $50,000. Tom was later named America's Favorite HouseGuest and was awarded $25,000.

Originally from Ontario, LaGrange moved to Red Deer in 1981. LaGrange was elected on April 16, 2019, and was appointed as the Minister of Education on April 30, 2019. In the 2019 Alberta general election, LaGrange won her constituency with a total of 12,739 votes based on a 62.6% voter turnout in Red-Deer North.  Career  LaGrange received a diploma in Rehab Studies from Humber College, and worked with the mentally and physically disabled before entering the political arena. In her time in Red Deer, LaGrange has served as the president of the Alberta Catholic School Trustees' Association until her resignation in June 2018, vice-president of the Canadian Catholic School Trustees' Association, and has also served as a trustee on the Red Deer Catholic School board between 2007 and 2018. LaGrange is the former president of Red-Deer pro-life, and was on the board of directors for Alberta pro-life.  Political career  LaGrange ran her campaign specifically on improving healthcare in the Red Deer area, re- configuring the education system, and lowering taxes to create jobs in Alberta. LaGrange used various mediums to communicate her platform to the public, including door-to-door canvassing, hiring volunteers, and using social media. =Minister of Education= Since her appointment to the Minister of Education, LaGrange has announced various legislation concerning Alberta's education system. On June 5, 2019, LaGrange introduced the new Education Act under the United Conservative Party. LaGrange was critiqued in the legislature by the leader of the official opposition, Rachel Notley, that the new Education Act does not protect LGBTQ students. LaGrange expressed that the Act will have the most advanced Gay‚Äìstraight alliance provisions in all of Canada. On August 22, 2019, LaGrange appointed a panel of education experts from a variety of school districts and post secondary institutions to oversee the previous education legislation enacted by the Alberta New Democratic Party. On October 23, 2019, Lagrange announced that the United Conservative Party revised the usage of seclusion rooms in public schools, limiting their usage to situations of a \\"last resort\\". On November 1, 2019, LaGrange announced that the United Conservative Party plans to build 15 new schools in Calgary along with 25 new education projects throughout the province such as modernization and updating infrastructure of schools currently operating. On November 20, 2019, LaGrange announced an independent financial audit and governance review of the Calgary Board of Education after the Board announced the cutting of 300 temporary teaching jobs. LaGrange claimed the reasoning behind the audit and governance review was to investigate the accountability of the Board's decision making with its finances. After the announcement of layoffs, LaGrange mentioned that the UCP was not aware of the actions. This was due to the fact that the Board met with the United Conservative Party the day before the announcement, and in that meeting, layoffs were not mentioned. On March 28, 2020, LaGrange significantly cut the budgets of school boards in Alberta, directing them to lay off approximately 20,000 - 25,000 employees. LaGrange had previously promised to maintain funding during the pandemic. This was the biggest single layoff in Canadian history.

This included Scenic Bow Place, with its Scenic Bow group homes, included GSS assisted-living facility‚Äîa long-term residence for approximately 200 developmentally challenged residents, with a staff of 300 staff. According to a July 25, 2020 Calgary Herald article, PDD guardians abd care givers attempted to submit a petition signed by 3,000 to Sawhney's Calgary office regarding privatization fears. According to a July 2020 CSS statement, the alternative service affects how services are delivered, not who will pay for them. The government will continue to pay for them but they will be contracted to \\"community-based organizations\\" that already provide 99% of residential and personal care services in Alberta. On July 17, 2020 CSS published a Request for Information (RFI) what is \\"currently available in the marketplace\\" as \\"alternative delivery model\\" for 24-hour Direct Operations programs in the Calgary and Edmonton regions, which could include \\"transitioning of residential and direct client services to contracted service providers\\". If all the facilities concerned are privatized, the government will save e C$3.48 million. In 2019, the UCP government conducted several forums on public policies relevant to persons with developmental disabilities. The New Democratic Party had raised concerns about \\"underfunding, low staff pay and shortages of training and affordable housing.\\" =Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped= Sawhney was Minister of Minister of Community and Social Services (CSS) when the unpopular October 24, 2019 provincial budget decision to de-index the Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) benefit from the Consumer Price Index, was announced. The UCP policy means that the maximum AISH rate for a single person will remain at C$1,685 per month and will not increase with the inflationary cost of living until at least 2023. The budget decision reverts the 2018 Bill 26: An Act to Combat Poverty and Fight for Albertans with Disabilities, enacted by the previous provincial New Democratic Party government. The budget included both generous decrease in corporate tax rates and deep cuts to health and education program budgets as part of the UCP 2019 election campaign commitment to balance the budget by 2021. In the fall of 2020, Sawhney's AISH portfolio attracted media attention as AISH was again under consideration for further cuts. In response to a Postmedia report revealing that the CSS was reviewing AISH and potentially making cuts, On September 14, Sawhney dismissed concerns saying, \\"Let me state definitively that there will be no cuts to AISH financial benefits.\\" On September 15, Premier Kenney said that the UCP was examining \\"eligibility criteria\\" for AISH benefits in order to cut provincial government costs. AISH attracted media attention again in early October as AISH benefits cheques were late due to a banking technical problem. =Homelessness and the Covid-19 pandemic= The UCP government announced $25 million in March and another $48 million in early August to help community organizations that work on homelessness by providing shelters and support for homeless people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CSS said in September that there was enough capacity for emergency shelters in Calgary. Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness's CEO, Tim Richter, told the Canadian Press, that normally winter emergency response planning is done in the summer. Concerns were raised that these plans had not been made by September, and the funding had not been allocated. Sawhney told the CP that she was working with her counterpart in the UCP cabinet‚ÄîSeniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon‚Äîto address the \\"very dire need\\" for \\"permanent supportive housing in Alberta.\\" In his response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's September 23, 2020 speech from the throne at the opening the 43rd Canadian Parliament, in which the federal government \\"focussed on entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada\\", Calgary mayor, Naheed Nenshi, said that the federal commitment to end homelessness could result in Calgary ending homelessness in two years, if the municipal, provincial, and federal governments work together.

Life Grave of Joseph von Hauer at the St. Marx Cemetery, Vienna Joseph von Hauer, son of Karl Josef von Hauer, member of the Austrian Imperial War Council, studied law until 1798 at the University of Vienna. In 1800 he became district commissioner in Korneuburg. After 1807 he worked at the Imperial Finance Bureau in Vienna, serving as its vice-chairman from 1831 until his retirement in 1848. He also performed various diplomatic tasks. In 1805 he served in the army commissariat with the Russian troops, and after the Battle of Austerlitz with the French troops. In 1807 he carried out an economic tour of the Alpine districts. In 1809 he was involved in the relocation of archival and artistic materials, including the Imperial \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" (Naturalienkabinett), from Vienna to Hungary to escape the French. He was able to return this to Vienna in 1810. In 1810 he traveled with Karl Chotek of Chotk√≥w to France to survey economic and political conditions there for the imperial government. In 1811 he became a member of the commission for the elimination of banknotes, and in 1816 he was involved in the regulation of the coinage. He also published writings on topics of the financial and administrative system. In addition to his profession Hauer was interested in science, especially in paleontology. For example, he explored the Tertiary strata of the Vienna Basin. Fossil material of foraminifera which he discovered and collected was used by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1846 for his monograph on the foraminifera of the Vienna Basin. In 1846 Hauer became a member of the Association of Freunde der Naturwissenschaften. In 1847 he was admitted to the Geology and Paleontology Section of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Von Hauer is buried at the St. Marx Cemetery in Vienna. His collection is now in the Mountain Museum of the Geological Survey in Vienna. His son, Franz Ritter von Hauer, was also active as a geologist and paleontologist, another son, Karl von Hauer, was a captain in the imperial army and a chemist.

She was professor of History at University of California, Davis from 1989 until her retirement in 2010. Her 1997 book Precious Records: Women in China's Long Eighteenth Century won the Joseph Levenson Book Prize in the field of pre-20th century China and the American Historical Association awarded the Fairbank Prize for the best book in East Asian history to The Talented Women of the Zhang Family (2007). In making their award, the Historical Association said both books were \\"path-breaking interventions\\", praising the former for recognizing the important influence of elite Chinese women and the latter for exploring the significance of same-sex social environments for both genders in elite Chinese society, adding that both \\"brilliantly demonstrated how placing women and gender at the center of the inquiry changes our overall view of Chinese history.\\" She was President of the Association for Asian Studies (2000) and has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2013. Education and career Mann graduated in Far Eastern languages and literatures from the University of Michigan, then earned her master's degree in Asian languages at Stanford University and then her doctorate there in 1972. Her doctoral dissertation concerned the eighteenth century scholar, Hong Liangji. She taught briefly at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago in the mid-1970s, and at University of California, Santa Cruz before joining the University of California, Davis, in 1989. At Davis she served as chair of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures and the Department of History. She received the Outstanding Mentor Award from the UC Davis Consortium for Women and Research. She was married to the anthropologist G. William Skinner until his death in 2008. Scholarship on gender and women Mann's first works focused on the relation between the Chinese merchant class and local officials, but while at the University of Chicago, The Women's Union asked Mann to be their sponsor. The students discussed feminist theory, which led Mann to ask new questions. She then turned her attention to women and gender relations in Chinese history. Mann joined feminist scholars in the 1980s and 1990s, including Patricia Ebrey, Charlotte Furth, Dorothy Ko, Evelyn Rawski, Paul Ropp, Ann Waltner, and Ellen Widmer, who turned their attention to the roles of women in the late Ming dynasty and early and mid Manchu Qing dynasty, the 16th through early 19th centuries. This period was relatively unstudied in spite of being the most richly documented period of Chinese history before Western influences became powerful in the 19th century. Economic growth and urbanization brought social mobility, while an expansion of printing and literacy gave voice to women. These recent scholars used texts written women and women in addition to texts written by men or women. They found that the anti-traditional biases of modern Chinese intellectuals against Confucianism and the traditional family had too often confirmed the same sorts of bias among Western scholars. The new work moved to correct misunderstandings about Confucian traditional society and the assumption that women were passive victims who helped to perpetuate their own victimhood because they were ignorant and powerless. Precious Records: Women in China's Long Eighteenth Century (1997), won the Joseph Levenson Prize from the Association for Asian Studies, and The Talented Women of the Zhang Family (2007), was a group biography of women in several generations of a literati family in the lower Yangzi region. The first, Precious Records, showed that upper-class women, although kept in the \\"inner quarters\\" and not allowed to participate in political life outside the home, were not mere victims of Confucian patriarchy. Mann used both the writings of the literati in their families, who wrote often appreciative accounts, and their own writings, mainly poetry. Mann's second prize-winning book, The Talented Women of the Zhang Family, explores many of the same themes but through portraits of three women, a mother, her daughter, and a great-niece, over a period from the 1790s to the 1860s, going from the height of Qing prosperity and peace to the chaos of the Taiping Rebellion.Mann not only translates the poetry of the women, but allows herself to recreate their feelings and invent some scenes that reveal their character. Gender and Sexuality in Modern China reprinted a range of her essays. Margaret Kuo, writing in China Review International praised her insights on gender and sexuality in modern China and described her as a leading authority on the subject. The essays use approaches from history, literature, philosophy, religion, and other disciplines, but build into an argument that has larger dimensions. Mann shows that the Chinese state played a generous role in regulating gender and sexuality, categories which in turn give historians materials that they can use in innovative ways. Kuo singled out her \\"masterful treatment\\" of the rise and fall of dynasties for \\"illustrating how adopting sexuality as an analytic category enables the historian to tackle areas in which actual women may not have been present but gendered power formations and sexualized ways of understanding the world certainly were.\\" Mann argues that the Chinese state was distinctive for the outsized role it played in regulating gender and sexuality, a role in which \\"the family, gendered division of labor, and processes of reproduction were more closely tied together with the operation of the state than perhaps in any other political system.\\" Selected publications     References   Notes  External links  * Mann, Susan Louise (1943- ) WorldCat Authority Page. * Susan Mann Google Scholar citations 1943 births American sinologists University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts alumni Stanford University alumni University of California, Davis faculty Presidents of the Association for Asian Studies 20th-century American historians 21st-century American historians American women historians Living people ","title":"Susan L.

He is a member of the United Conservative Party and was appointed to the Executive Council of Alberta as the Alberta Minister of Health on April 30, 2019. Early life Tyler Shandro was born in Edmonton, Alberta, and later moved to Calgary to attend the University of Calgary and begin his legal career. During his legal career he served as a member of several boards, including the Criminal Injuries Review Board, the National Parole Board, and the Municipal Government Board. Tyler also served on the Calgary Police Commission. Previously he was appointed as a member of the Disaster Advisory Committee after the 2013 Alberta floods. Tyler Shandro's great-uncle Andrew Shandro served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for the Whitford electoral district from 1913 to 1922 representing the Liberal Party of Alberta. The hamlet of Shandro, Alberta in Lamont County is named in honour of Tyler's pioneering ancestors. Political life Shandro was a long time volunteer with the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta. Following the party's defeat in the 2015 Alberta general election, Shandro would run unsuccessfully for Party President against Katherine O'Neill. During this time Shandro rejected calls to merge the Progressive Conservatives with the Wildrose Party, calling the idea \\"insulting to most of our members\\". Following Jason Kenney's enterance into provinical politics, Shandro would have a change of heart, supporting the amalgamation, and writing one of the legal briefs arguing the amalgamation was legally possible. Shandro served on the committee which set out the terms forming the United Conservative Party of Alberta following the 2017 merger of the Progressive Conservatives and Wildrose Parties. Shandro would contest the 2019 Alberta general election in the district of Calgary-Acadia which was previously held by New Democratic MLA Brandy Payne, who retired from politics following the closure of the 29th Alberta Legislature. Shandro would capture 12,615 votes (54%) defeating five other opponents including the next closest candidate, Kate Andrews representing the NDP with 8,049 votes (35%). =Minister of Health= On 30 April 2019, Shandro was appointed to the Executive Council of Alberta as the Minister of Health. Scandal and controversy In March 2020, Shandro was implicated in a scandal after CBC news made it public that Shandro's wife was head of an insurance company that profited off of changes to provincial physician reimbursement that led to physicians having to fire staff and shutter practices. Shandro later publicly attacked a physician who shared a meme critical of the apparent conflict of interest on social media, screaming at and berating the physician that his wife was receiving threats as a result. Incidents were also revealed related to Shandro directly contacting his constituents to harass and bully them in reply to messages sent to his wife's company, detailing a clear conflict of interest. Both Shandro and his wife were witnessed screaming, crying and bullying a neighbour. The same article reveals that Shandro harassed a constituent and called her a madwoman when she complained regarding the apparent conflict of interest, in that a company both he and his wife are deeply involved in are benefiting from legislative changes that he pushed through, Shandro then threatened to send provincial security services after the woman. Minister Shandro was also accused of illegally obtaining the personal phone numbers of two physicians from Alberta Health Services, and contacting them. Sharon Polsky, president of the Privacy and Access Council of Canada, said: \\"That's tantamount to obtaining a personal home address and knocking on the door and saying 'Hi, I'm your boss the minister, I'd like to have a chat with you.'\\" Following media coverage of the confrontation, political opposition and citizens called for the resignation of Shandro. Despite the public outcry, and the physician fearing for his family's safety, Shandro refused to publicly apologize to the physician. Shandro did, however, apologize to citizens for distracting from the COVID-19 pandemic and received support from United Conservative Party leader, Jason Kenney, who agreed that Shandro's behaviour was justified given that Shandro felt he was defending his family.. Shandro has struggled to recover from this incident, with a mere 34% of Albertans expressing their approval for his handling of COVID-19 (the lowest approval rating in Canada). In a July 2020 survey of Alberta doctors, 98% of respondents said that they had lost confidence in Shandro.

They were split into three groups/ranks, The Kibei Boys (Japanese-Americans from Japan), Isei Boys (1st generation Japanese- Americans), and the Nisei Boys (2nd generation Japanese-Americans).  History  During World War 2, then current American president Franklin D. Roosevelt passed Executive Order 9066 which infamously criminalized the being of any Japanese person or person of Japanese ancestry, and forcefully relocated all Japanese and Japanese-Americans into concentration camps, and stripped them of American Constitutional Rights. The most infamous of these camps was Manzanar, where over 100,000 Japanese Americans were jailed. Due to the cruel, unfair, and harsh conditions, a group of rebellious Japanese youths and adults quickly formed a gang. At first there was a power struggle between other gangs in the camp, however, after the Manzanar Riots, almost all gangs united into the Tokyo Boys a.k.a. Manzanar Black Dragons. Throughout the lifetime of the camp, The Tokyo Boys were not involved in high-level crimes, but rather trivial offenses such as stealing extra rations and harassing non-Japanese prisoners.  Post-Manzanar History  After the Japanese-Americans were released from Manzanar, many went to California to work legally and reintegrate into American society. However, due to the time period (1940s-1950s), many Japanese Americans couldn't find work, and even if they could, it wouldn't be enough to support themselves and their families. This combined with the scars of internment and rampant racism has caused many Japanese-Americans to this day remain under the poverty line in places along the West Coast (California, Nevada, and Oregon). Due to their socio-economic position, many members of the Tokyo Boys continued their lifestyle of crime after their release, however, as time progressed, so did the severity of their crimes. The majority of Tokyo Boys moved to San Francisco where they adapted to become a modern street gang, and with the creation of Japan Town in 1968, cemented themselves into the Bay Area. The gang functioned in normal activities such as narcotic sales and prostitution, and in the 1970s expanded into other cities and created new factions such as Daly Nihon in Daly City, South Side Tokyo Boys in South San Francisco, and Sakura Tokyo Boys in Oakland. In the late 1970s, The Tokyo Boys formed connections with Japanese Yakuza across the Pacific and was soon involved in both street level and highly sophisticated crime. At this time, Tokyo Boys was thought to have at least 500 members all across the Bay Area. Also at this time, Tokyo Boys made small alliances with members of the Wah Ching gang. During the 1990s, when a faction of the Wah Ching gang returned to San Francisco, the Tokyo Boys welcomed them back warmly since the Wah Ching was now significantly more powerful and an alliance was both beneficial and profitable. The Wah Ching, though relatively small compared to the Tokyo Boys (The Wah Ching in SF had ~100 members compared to the Tokyo Boys ~750) they supplied the Tokyo Boys with most of their narcotics and weapons, and soon the Tokyo Boys relied on the Wah Ching for supplies, and the Wah Ching relied on the Tokyo Boys for manpower. This close criminal relationship eventually led to the Tokyo Boys assimilating into the Wah Ching to create the Jackson-Side Wah Ching, and thus in the present day, many members of Jackson Side Wah Ching (JS-23) will refer to themselves as Tokyo Boys and vice versa. After the Alliance, the newly founded Jackson-Side Wah Ching expanded even further across state lines into Reno, Nevada to gain control of the criminal side of legal casinos, which led to some conflicts with the American Mafia.

Unlike other MHC types such as MHC class I and MHC class II, of which their structure and functions in immune response are well defined, MHC class III are poorly defined structurally and functionally. They are not involved in antigen binding (the process called antigen presentation, a classic function of MHC proteins). Only few of them are actually involved in immunity while many are signalling molecules in other cell communications. They are mainly known from their genes because their gene cluster is present between those of class I and class II. The gene cluster was discovered when genes (specifically those of complement components C2, C4, and factor B) were found in between class I and class II genes on the short (p) arm of human chromosome 6. It was later found that it contains many genes for different signalling molecules such as tumour necrosis factors (TNFs) and heat shock proteins. More than 60 MHC class III genes are described, which is about 28% of the total MHC genes (224). The region within MHC class III gene cluster that contains genes for TNFs is also known as MHC class VI or inflammatory region. In contrast to other MHC proteins, MHC class III proteins are produced by liver cells (hepatocytes) and special white blood cells (macrophages), among others. Gene structure MHC class III genes are located on chromosome 6 (6p21.3) in humans. It covers 700 kb and contains 61 genes. The gene cluster is the most gene-dense region of the human genome. They are basically similar with those of other animals. The functions of many genes are yet unknown. Many retroelements such as human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) and Alu elements are located in the cluster. The region containing genes G11/C4/Z/CYP21/X/Y, varying in size from 142 to 214 kb, is known as the most complex gene cluster in the human genome.. =Diversity= MHC class III genes are similar in humans, mouse, frog (Xenopus tropicalis), and gray short-tailed opossum, but not all genes are common. For example, human NCR3, MIC and MCCD1 are absent in mouse. Human NCR3 and LST1 are absent in opossum. However, birds (chicken and quail) have only a single gene, which codes for a complement component gene (C4). In fishes, the genes are distributed in different chromosomes.

It is located directly west of the village of Santo Ni√±o (former Ibayo), separated from it by the Estero de Tripa de Gallina stream, and between Tambo to the north and the Para√±aque poblacion of La Huerta to the south. The barangay also includes the southernmost section of Bay City, including portions of the Asia World subdistrict such as Entertainment City and Marina Bay. Don Galo is home to the Para√±aque Fisherman's Wharf, also known as the Bulungan Market, a wholesale coastal fish market where fish catch are sold to the highest bidder by \\"whispering\\" of prices. It is also the location of a Taoist temple known as the Kiu Pat Liong Shiao Temple, a prominent landmark along the Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway. As of the 2015 census, it had a population of 11,645. History The village was originally known as Santa Monica, and was named for the barrio's patroness whose image is enshrined in the Santa Monica chapel on Santa Monica Street originally built in the 17th century.Dulce Festin Baybay, Ariel Marquez-de Guzman (2001). Palanyag to Para√±aque: A History, p. 182. City of Para√±aque, Philippines. It takes its present name from a local hero of the Red Sea incident during the 1574 Battle of Manila, so named for the blood of invaders that spilled on it on November 30, 1574. The man, known simply as Galo, was said to have led his barrio folks in a successful effort to stop the advance of invading forces led by the Chinese pirate Limahong. The man was knighted by the Spanish colonial government in Manila for his heroism and was granted the title of \\"Don\\" after leading his barrio folks against the pirates. From a traditional fishing village occupying a narrow strip of land on an estuary leading to the Manila Bay, Don Galo now covers a total land area of through land reclamation in the 1970s and 1980s. The Asia World subdistrict, part of the Boulevard 2000 project initiated by the Philippine Reclamation Authority in 1977, added of land to Para√±aque now shared between Don Galo and Tambo. The Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway, also built on reclaimed land in the foreshore area of Don Galo, Tambo, La Huerta and San Dionisio, was opened in 1985. The national government appropriated of these reclaimed lands in Don Galo for socialized housing in 2005. A monument commemorating the 1574 Battle of Manila with the statues of Don Galo and Limahong was unveiled at Don Galo Park in 2012. Education The village is home to the following institutions: * Don Galo Elementary School * God's Heritage Christian Academy * Para√±aque National High School (Don Galo Annex) Transportation The Para√±aque Integrated Terminal Exchange in Don Galo Don Galo is traversed by Elpidio Quirino Avenue on its eastern section which serves as its main street connecting it to La Huerta to the south via the Don Galo‚ÄìLa Huerta Bridge over the Para√±aque River and Tambo and Baclaran to the north. Along its western section runs the Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway where the proposed Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 will be constructed. The village is connected to its Bay City extension via a narrow road crossing under the Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway called Enrique Factoran Road. It connects to Pacific Avenue which serves as the main east-west street of Marina Bay village and which is also linked to the expressway via a flyover interchange constructed in 2018. Macapagal Boulevard starts at its junction with Pacific Avenue and links Don Galo to the Mall of Asia complex in Pasay. The Asia World station of LRT Line 1 will serve Don Galo and the adjacent Asia World subdistrict of Bay City once completed and will be located on the east service road (Tambo Service Road) of the Manila Cavite Expressway.

He was elected in the 2019 Alberta general election to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the electoral district of Edmonton-South West. Early life Kelechi Madu was born and raised in Southeastern Nigeria, and would attend the University of Lagos graduating with a Bachelor of Laws, and being called to the bar in Nigeria. He would migrate to Edmonton in 2005 with his wife Emem for her postgraduate studies at the University of Alberta. Madu would work for Alberta Hospital, Legal Aid Alberta and the Government of Alberta in a number of different roles. Political life Kelechi Madu was an active member of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta, organizing delegate selection meetings, and later supporting the merger of the party with the Wildrose Party in 2017. Madu would volunteer and support Jason Kenney during the 2017 PC leadership election and the 2017 United Conservative Party leadership election following the merger. During the 2019 Alberta general election Madu would contest the constituency of Edmonton-South West, which was previously held by New Democratic Party MLA Thomas Dang, who chose to run in Edmonton-South following the 2017 Electoral Boundary Re-distribution. Madu would defeat four candidates capturing 10,245 votes (45%), above the next closest candidate John Archer, a former reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and Brian Mason's press secretary, representing the NDP with 9,539 (42%). Madu would be the only United Conservative Party candidate elected within the boundaries of the city of Edmonton. =Minister of Municipal Affairs= On 30 April 2019, Madu was appointed to the Executive Council of Alberta as the Minister of Municipal Affairs, and held that role until August 25, 2020 when he was appointed Minister of Justice and Solicitor General. Early in his mandate, Madu wrote an op-ed published in Postmedia newspapers titled Spending by Alberta's two big cities‚Äî is unsustainable which called on municipal leaders in Calgary City Council and Edmonton City Council to lower spending and reduce taxes, claiming the cities placed an \\"undue burden\\" on residents. The article was published on October 22, 2019, two days prior to the introduction of the provincial budget. Claims made in the op-ed were challenged by the Mayors of Calgary and Edmonton, including that the data supplied by Canadian Federation of Independent Business significantly overestimated the 10-year growth in municipal expenditures, and did not account for inflation. During his time as Minister of Municipal Affairs, Madu was responsible for a number of controversial funding reductions to Alberta municipalities. Among those decisions, included the repealing of the City Charters Fiscal Framework Act which legislated provincial transfers to the Cities of Edmonton and Calgary; reductions to the Municipal Sustainability Initiative, a infrastructure financing program which was reduced cumulatively by $236-million over two years from 2020-21 to 2021-22; and reduction of the Grants in Place of Taxes program by 50%, which provides municipalities with grants which off-set the property tax requisitions for provincially owned buildings. Madu oversaw the beginning of property assessment valuation changes to oil and gas infrastructure, changing from a valuation based on the replacement cost, to the depreciated value of the asset, which led to the leaders of a number of rural municipalities in Alberta speaking out. According to CTV News, municipalities in rural Alberta raised concerns that the proposed changes would \\"cost them millions\\" by reducing the property tax base by between $108-million to $291-million. Madu introduced Local Authorities Election Amendment Act, 2020 (Bill 29) to the Alberta Legislature in June 2020, which amended the legislation which outlines the rules for municipal and school board elections. The amendments to the Local Authorities Election Act removed the requirement for candidates to disclose their donors prior to election day, removed limits on spending by third-party advertisers outside the local election campaign period from May 1 to election day in October, and allowed individuals to donate up to $5,000 to as many candidates as they want during an election. The Alberta Urban Municipalities Association, which represents urban municipal elected officials in Alberta released a statement shortly after the introduction of Bill 29, stating the relationship between Minister Madu and the association was \\"Broken\\". Bill 29 and other policy decisions were cited as the reason for the statement by the AUMA. One month following the statement, Premier Jason Kenney shuffled his Cabinet, moving Madu to Minister of Justice and Solicitor General, and promoting backbench MLA Tracy Allard to the role of Minister of Municipal Affairs. On March 4, 2020, Kaycee Madu was designated as a Queen's Counsel by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta via an Order-in-Council. Queen's Counsel is the highest honour awarded to lawyers who have made significant contributions to the advancement of law and society.

History =1840s up to Russian Revolution= While the first Russian Orthodox archimandrite arrived in Palestine in 1844, Russia's focus on the area began when Napoleon III took over control of France in an 1851 coup d'√©tat and moved to seize control of properties in the Holy Land held by members of the Greek Orthodox Church (GOC). The court of the Czar had long held itself to be the main patron and protector of Orthodoxy, especially after most of the membership of the Greek Orthodox Church from 1460 until 1821 fell under the control of the Islamic Ottoman Empire (with its oppressive Devshirmeh and jizya laws). Through diplomacy and a show of force Napoleon III forced the Ottoman Empire to recognize France as the \\"sovereign authority\\" in the Holy Land. This moved control of many Christian holy sites and buildings out of Orthodox hands and under Catholicism. These events were one of the main triggers for the Crimean War of 1856. Despite defeat in the war by 1856, Russia continued actively pursuing its interests vis-√†-vis the position and influence of the Ottoman Empire and its European allies. Czar Alexander II continually worked to make sure Russia would have a presence in Palestine. Towards these ends a consulate was created in 1858. The Czar also funded the work of Constantin von Tischendorf in finding the Codex Sinaiticus at the Saint Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai. The Czar's brother, the Grand Duke Constantine, and his wife the Princess Alexandra toured the area at this time. Significantly it was also around this period that Bishop Euspensy began missionary work in the area (his detractors claim he was \\"a czarist agent\\" with a \\"scheme of wresting the Jerusalem patriarchate away from the church's liturgical twin, the Greek Orthodox Church.\\"). Euspensy's efforts did not produce much but a few Christian Arab converts switching from the GOC to the ROC. The Russian government began using its diplomatic influence to persuade the Ottoman sultans to refuse the berat to candidates for patriarch to any GOC bishop that disagreed with them. By 1860 the Russian Palestine Society was founded. The society guided pilgrims to the Holy Land and bought property in Jerusalem and Nazareth. In addition it ran a theological seminary that also focused on teaching politics. The Russian Palestine Society built hospices for Russian pilgrims and churches (where the liturgy was in Slavonic) all over the country \\"to the great annoyance of the Greek patriarchal element.\\" The ROC soon attracted more Arab Christians as it championed the idea that local Arab clergy should be promoted to bishops and hierarchs instead of having clergy from Greece imported and put in authority over them. Also in the 1860s the Russians began building an extensive group of buildings outside the city of Jerusalem on Jaffa road, known as the Russian Compound. These consisted of a large and elaborate church where the Russian archimandrite officiated, massive hostels for the pilgrims, a hospital and several other buildings capable of housing 1000 pilgrims, all within walking distance of the Russian consulate headquarters at the time. The ROC also built an ornate church at Gethsemane, and another at the site where their tradition holds that Jesus made his Ascension at the Mount of Olives. Another Russian hospice was built in the Muristan, along with an asylum for the insane, and schools. Russian pilgrimages were not only encouraged, but even subsidized by the Czar's government. At the time both Russia's political enemies and many within the GOC saw these projects as an intrigue of the Czar to make himself \\"a center of the Greek faith [i.e. Orthodoxy] which should rival Rome itself.\\" This would all change with the fall of the Russian monarchy. =After the Russian Revolution= With the rise of the communists most of the church properties in Palestine remained in the hands of those at odds with the Bolsheviks, and the majority of these joined with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). Some properties of the ROC remained completely closed until 1941, when the Politburo ordered the churches reopened. An invitation was extended by the Soviets for all Orthodox prelates in the Middle East to come to Moscow to witness the installation of Patriarch Alexei I. In 1952 the Soviets reopened the Russian Palestine Society under the direction of Communist Party agents from Moscow, replaced Archimandrite Vladimir with communist trained Ignaty Polikarp, and won over many Christian Arabs with communist sympathies to the ROC. The members of other branches of Orthodoxy refused to associate with the Soviet led ROC in Palestine. The ROCOR maintained control over churches and properties in the Jordanian-ruled West Bank unmolested until the late 1980s. =Eviction by the Palestinian Authority = In 1997 Patriarch of Moscow Alexei II attempted to visit a ROCOR held monastery in Hebron with Yasser Arafat. It has been noted that \\"The Moscow- based church has enjoyed a close relationship with Arafat since his guerilla fighter days.\\" Upon arrival Arafat and the patriarch were refused entry by the ROCOR clergy, who held that Alexy had no legitimate authority. Two weeks afterwards police officers of the Palestinian Authority arrived and by \\"assaulting and cursing priests and nuns\\" they managed to evict the ROCOR clergy and then turned over the property to the ROC. ROCOR Mother Superior Juliana said \\"We were told you have to leave because this man has to come here. This man was from the red church [i.e. the ROC].\\" Another nun stated \\"They put me on the floor and they dragged me like a sack of potatoes.\\" Alexy made another visit in early January 2000 to meet with Arafat and asked \\"for help in recovering church properties\\" as part of a \\"worldwide campaign to recover properties lost to churches that split off during the Communist era\\". Later that month the Palestinian Authority again moved to evict ROCOR clergy, this time from the Jericho Gardens with a Chapel. Five ROCOR monks and two nuns were forcibly removed from the property and ROC clergy took their places. The monks and nuns who were evicted said that they had been \\"badly manhandled.\\" A monk claimed he was \\"knocked to the ground, handcuffed and beaten.\\" The ROCOR clergy stated that \\"the police refused to produce any documentation\\" and all seven of the ROCOR evictees required hospitalization. The claims that the PA police used force were disputed by Palestinian Security Chief Jibril Rajoub \\"This is not true. It did not happen. It will never happen in the future. ...As the responsible authority in Hebron and all parts of the West Bank, we have the right to do our best to help them [the ROC].\\" The eviction of the ROCOR clergy at the Jericho Gardens (with a Chapel) gained international attention because two ROCOR nuns who were American citizens managed to sneak into the confiscated monastery and barricade themselves inside a portion of the complex. Further media attention became focused on the event when it was discovered that one of the nuns was Maria Stephanopoulos the sibling of George Stephanopoulos the former advisor to U.S. President Bill Clinton. Maria and her fellow nun Xenia Cesena communicated with reporters their motivation \\"No matter what happens to the property, we made it clear to the world what the Moscow church is doing to us.\\" The supervisor of the ROCOR mission Archbishop Mark declared that they had \\"been talking with the Palestinian administration but so far no solution has been found, unfortunately.\\" He said that the International Red Cross had been denied access to the nuns and any request for ROCOR clergy to visit the women had been rebuffed. He declared \\"The PA interfered in church affairs without a legal right. It's a state interference into church affairs [and] a violation of human rights.\\" The compound was \\"bustling with staff from the Russian Consulate\\" and it was reported that they were giving food to the nuns. During the incident the five evicted monks maintained a vigil outside the monastery sleeping in their car. As the nuns were American citizens the U.S. Consulate in East Jerusalem became involved to ensure their safety. When Arafat visited the US while the incident was ongoing the subject was raised by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Ibrahim Kandalaft, in charge of Christian Affairs in the PA Ministry of Religious Affairs, told reporters \\"There is nothing so important here. This monastery belonged to the church of Moscow before 1917. It is returned to them.\\" The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the PA raid, saying it \\"violated the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements under which both sides are to respect holy sites.\\" After confining herself to a section of the monastery without running water for over 60 days Sister Maria Stephanopoulos (who began limiting herself to a bread and water diet as a form of hunger strike) appealed to Pope John Paul II (who was making a historic visit in the area) to use his influence on Arafat to resolve the conflict, she said \\"I would hope this issue's going to resonate with him. He was in Poland and he really had a lot to do with the downfall of communism there, so he should certainly understand.\\" Roman Catholic Bishop and the Vatican's ambassador to Jerusalem Kamal Bathish stated bluntly that the pope would not meet with Sister Maria or intervene on her behalf. Sister Maria complained of \\"brusque treatment at the hands of the Palestinian Authority guards\\" and being \\"harassed by the Moscow Patriarchate monks who occupy the other half of the compound.\\" In an address to reporters her sibling, George Stephanopoulos, stated that he planned to meet with her in Hebron, and said \\"My greatest concern, as her brother, is that Sr. Maria remains safe and healthy, and I admire her determination.\\" An agreement brokered by U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Rep. Tom Lantos and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan with the PA, the U.S. consulate and the Moscow Patriarchate was made to allow Sister Maria and Sister Xenia Cesena greater access to the entire property, especially the monastery's chapel. Despite this, Sister Maria stated that the ROC monks were still preventing her from worshiping in the chapel, \\"Anytime we get close they close the door in our face. There's no such thing as equal access.\\" She told reporters she had no intention of relenting, saying \\"I believe in the new martyrs, what they stood for. The freedom of the church in the end is what it's about.\\" =Current Situation= Today, both the ROC and ROCOR have a continued, and separate existence in the Holy Land, but the 2007 signing of the Act of Canonical Communion has brought about a new era of cooperation between the two parts of the Russian Church.

Election as Abbot General  On 2 January 1643, when he was not yet 37 years old, Dr. Claude Vaussin was elected abbot of C√Æteaux. He came from an influential but non-aristocratic family in Dijon, had become a monk in Clairvaux and later served as Prior in Froidmont Abbey.Nguyen-Dinh-Tuy√™n, Histoire des Controverses √† Rome (see Literature), p. 11-12. He was the successor of none other than the infamous Cardinal Richelieu, who had let himself be elected to this position in 1635 in order to manipulate the warring factions in the Cistercian Order to his personal benefit. Many abbots did not accept his election. Claude Vaussin's election was rejected by the Reform movement; yet after his election had been investigated and repeated, Vaussin emerged on 10 May 1645 once again as the Abbot of C√Æteaux and therefore Abbot General. It took almost four years before Vaussin received confirmation from the Holy See and the King of France, finally allowing him to take office in C√Æteaux in 1649. Although validly elected, he still faced opposition from the Strict Observance. They dominated the General Chapter of 1651 and were granted a certain amount of independence by being able to form their own congregation, but that was not enough: They wanted control of the Cistercian Order.J√∂rg Oberste, Die Zisterzienser (Stuttgart 2014), p. 246. The ascetic measures initiated by the Strict Observance at the beginning of the 17th century had been encouraged by the French kings. In 1634, Cardinal La Rochefoucauld added his support to the movement, leading to much controversy and seemingly unending polemics; the War of Observances also had its political dimensions. Some supporters of the Strict Observance saw it as a way of dividing the Cistercian monks from the order's hierarchy, not least of all from the Vatican itself. The unity of the Order was in great danger.Louis Lekai, The White Monks. A History of the Cistercian Order (Okauchee, Wisc., 1953), p. 100.  Accomplishments as Abbot General  Claude Vaussin used canonical visitations as a means of monitoring monastic life in Cistercian abbeys. He made two large trips through French monasteries as a visitor in 1648 and 1653. 1654 saw him visiting Swiss, German, Bohemian and Austrian abbeys. The \\"National Chapter\\" at Rottweil in 1654, during which Vaussin himself presided at, improved the unity of the Upper German Congregation within its own ranks and strengthen its ties to its mother abbey of C√Æteaux. The German abbots became Vaussin's strongest allies in his conflicted relations to the French abbots of the Strict Observance. The following abbatial elections in the primary abbeys of Clairvaux (1653) and La Fert√© (1655) resulted in abbots who Vaussin had endorsed. But after 1656, the Strict Observance rose to new dominance. The French court continued their support, and in 1660, La Rochefoucauld declared the Reformed statutes to be binding. Vaussin canceled the General Chapter which had been called for 1661 and protested against the court's actions to the Vatican, traveling there personally in order to attain its retraction. Pope Alexander VII. (1655‚Äì1667) called a meeting of representatives of both observances to be held at Rome on 26 January 1662, (Feast of St. Alberic, Abbot of C√Æteaux): Vaussin represented the Order, and the abbots Dominique Georges (Le Val-Richer Abbey) and Jean de Ranc√© (La Trappe Abbey) represented the Strict Observance. The result was the founding of a special commission to examine the dispute between the camps.Compendium of the History of the Cistercian Order (Trappist, Kentucky 1944), p. 250-251. Several years later, the special commission produced the Apostolic Constitution of 19 April 1666 titled In suprema. It was accepted by all parties, including the Strict Observance. A General Chapter was held in 1667 and officially distributed and endorsed the text. The General Abbot died after 24 years of service as the head of the Order, aged 63, in Dijon.  Legacy  The next two General Chapters (1672 and 1683) continued to wrangle with the conflicts among monastic camps, until finally in 1683 the Chapter granted the Strict Observance the measure of autonomy that they had desired for so long. Vaussin did not end the Cistercian War of Observances; however, he strengthened the international unity of the Order and prohibited the isolation of French abbeys from the rest of the Order. Vaussin was also influential in the reform of the Cistercian Rite, which had previously been spared from the Tridentine Reforms. Under his leadership, the liturgical books were adapted to the Roman Rite and distributed widely among the abbeys.  References  * Louis J. Lekai: The Cistercians. Ideals and Reality (Kent/Ohio, 2.

The publication was initiated by Cistercian monks of the Strict Observance. An expanded edition was published in 1892 in Solesmes, edited by Father Hugues S√©jalon.  Contents  Narrative texts about the origins of the Cistercian movement open the book. They describe the early history, the fervor of the monks, their way of life and biographical details about the monks who wrote the early legislation. The collection proper consists of three parts. The first contains the Rule of St. Benedict, the Carta Caritatis, the Usus Antiquiores and several resolutions approved by the General Chapter. The second contains, among others, deliberations among abbots under Pope Urban IV. and a text by Pope Clement IV. regarding the interpretation of the Carta Caritatis. The third section contains the reform bull Benedictina and papal missives to various Cistercian General Chapters.  Purpose  The Nomasticon was intended to strengthen the position of the Strict Observance in their endeavor to \\"reform\\" the Cistercian Order according to a literal interpretation of the Rule of St. Benedict. The editor, Julien Paris, who taught at the University of Paris and was abbot of Foucarmont Abbey, was himself a supporter of the Strict Observance.cf. authorship note in the Nomasticon He sought to return to a way of life he believed to have been lived by Cistercians in the first generations after the movement began in 1098. He writes in his foreword that the order's reputation for sanctity was based on the strict adherence to their early legislation.Quis enim nesciat harum beneficio Legum, hunc ipsum Ordinem, in ea tunc temporis apud omnes sanctitatis existimatione fuisse, immo et ad eum perfectionis statum pervenisse, ut fere omnes pertraheret ad sanctiorem vivendi et agendi rationem? He perceived many of the monks of his day, among them those who belonged to the Common Observance, to be decadent. The Nomasticon was meant to give them the rules and regulations that would lead to sanctity.Quis enim non aegre ferret, Leges tam sanctas, tam accuratas, tam omni ex parte perfectas haberi neglectui, immo et aliquando contemptui, etiam ab iis qui non nisi earum beneficio vivunt et subditis imperant?  Role in research  In both the first edition and that of 1892, the Nomasticon has served as an important collection of sources for Cistercian research. Scholars of recent generations have noted that the medieval sources in the book are not edited according to contemporary standards. Many more sources have become available since it was published. The edition published by S√©jalon (1892) is the most recent.  Literature  * Julien Paris, Hugues S√©jalon (eds.): Nomasticon Cisterciense seu antiquiores Ordinis Cistercienses constitutiones.

The eastern provinces of interwar Poland were inhabited by an ethnically mixed population, with ethnic Poles as well as Polish Jews dominant in the cities. These lands now form the backbone of modern Western Ukraine and Western Belarus. The annexation of the Polish territories, which were added to Soviet Byelorussia, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic alone, resulted in the Soviet state gaining , and increasing its population by over seven million people. Annexation of eastern half of interwar Poland On September 17, 1939 the Red Army entered Polish territory, acting on the basis of a secret clause of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Soviet Union would later deny the existence of this secret protocol, claiming that it was never allied with the German Reich, and acted independently to \\"protect\\" the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities in the disintegrating Polish state.Anna M.

The elections were designed to give the annexation an appearance of validity, but were far from free or fair. The voters had a choice of only one candidate, often a local communist or someone sent to western Belarus from Soviet Belarus for each position of deputy; the communist party commissars then provided the assembly with resolutions that would push through nationalization of banks and heavy industry and transfers of land to peasant communities., pp. 29‚Äì30. Elections took place on October 22, 1939; the official numbers reported participation of 93 percent of the electorate, 91 percent of whom supported the appointed candidates. Based on these results, the People's Assembly of Western Belarus voted unanimously to thank Stalin for liberation and sent a delegation to Moscow to ask for formal inclusion of the territories into the Belarusian SSR. The Supreme Soviet voted to do so on November 1, 1939 and on November 15 a law was passed making the former eastern Polish territories a part of the Belarusian SSR. On October 30, the People's Assembly of Western Belarus session held in Belastok (Polish Bia≈Çystok) affirmed the Soviet decision to join the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR) with the USSR.

During the two years following the annexation, the Soviets arrested approximately 100,000 Polish citizens across Kresy. Due to a lack of access to the secret Soviet and Belorussian archives, for many years after the war the estimates of the number of Polish citizens deported to Siberia from the areas of Western Belorussia, as well as the number who perished under Soviet rule, were only estimated. In August 2009, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion, the authoritative Polish Institute of National Remembrance announced that its researchers reduced the estimate of the number of people deported to Siberia to 320,000 in total.

The mountain is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Snohomish County and Chelan County, and also straddling the boundary between Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest. White Mountain is located to the west-southwest of Kololo Peaks, and immediately north of White Pass. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the south slope of the peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into the White River, White Chuck River, and Sauk River. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is north-northeast of White Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to White Mountain, volcanic ash is common in the area and provides fertile soil for an abundance of wildflowers. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate White Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Its work focuses on international project and export financing. The banks headquarter is located in Frankfurt, where the KfW IPEX-Bank uses the Westarkade, which was completed in 2011. History The KfW, founded in 1948, used the instruments of export and project financing (E&P;) within its business model quite early on. In 1950 the KfW was given this task. This branch of their business became increasingly important in the 1980s and 1990s and, not least because of this, attracted the attention of the competition authorities of the European Union, who regarded the Bank's activities as a German development bank in the area of E&P; as non-competitive. This is mainly because this business activity did not take place under market conditions within the protected area of a development bank secured by the German state and thus created an inadmissible competitive advantage. The outsourcing of the KfW's international project and export financing goes back to an agreement between Germany and the European Commission on the orientation of legally independent development institutions in Germany. Under the terms of the agreement, the KfW may use the refinancing benefits in the form of federal guarantees only for its original promotional activities as defined in a list of tasks. All other activities were, according to the agreement, spun off until the beginning of 2008 into a privately organized credit institution, which operates under the competitive conditions of the market. On August 15, 2003, the Deutscher Bundestag implemented this agreement in the F√∂rderbankenneustrukturierungsgesetz (Development Bank Restructuring Act). As of January 1, 2004, the brand KfW IPEX-Bank (IPEX stands for International Project and Exportfinanzing) was constituted within the framework of a four- year transitional phase (the so-called bank-in-the-bank phase). On 1 January 2008, it was spun off in the legal form of a Limited liability company as a company and is subject to full tax liability and in particular the banking supervision, which does not apply to the parent company, the KfW. In 2014, KfW successfully lobbied for the KfW IPEX-Bank to remain under national supervision on the grounds that its parent group is in the ownership of the German government; the bank had origionally been on a list of 24 German lenders that were among 128 banks across the eurozone deemed significant enough to be supervised directly by the European Central Bank.Alexander Huebner (February 12, 2014), Germany's KfW wants its export bank removed from ECB oversight Reuters.Alice Ross (April 20, 2014), KfW presses regulators to take investment arm off ECB list Financial Times. Operations =Strategic focus and financing products= The KfW IPEX-Bank is a specialist bank for export and project financing. The tasks of the KfW IPEX-Bank consist of financing in the interest of the German and European economy and are derived from the statutory mandate of the KfW. The focus is on the provision of medium and long-term earmarked financing to support the export economy, the development of economic and social infrastructure, and environmental and climate protection projects. The KfW IPEX-Bank is active in the business sectors Basic Industry, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Trade & Health, Energy & Environment, Shipping & Ports, Aviation & Airports, Rail & Road, Construction & PPP.

Tellurium improves machinability of copper. Overview Tellurium is usually added to copper to improve machinability (\\"free cutting\\"). ASTM specification B301 has 0.5% tellurium; at concentrations of up to 0.75% machinability is improved whilst electrical conductivity and hot working behavior is maintained. Mechanical properties are similar to tough pitch copper, whilst machinability is similar to brass - the alloy's hardnesses are increased by precipitation of copper telluride. Tellurium copper is not suited to welding though can be welded with gas shielded arc welding or resistance welding; it can be readily soft soldered, silver soldered, or brazed. Tellurium copper can be used as the electrode in electrical discharge machining (EDM) - the alloy is used to replace copper when grinding wheel loading occurs during fine finishing of the electrode - the alloy retains the properties of copper in the EDM process.

Constructed in the late 19th century, it was in use until 1958. In the 21st century it has been restored after being dilapidated and vandalized. History The frame building was constructed in either 1887 (for $400) or 1892 (for $500) as a one-room school for black (\\"colored\\") children under segregation. It was initially called Colored School #A or Cedar Lane Colored School; in 1892 it was sold to the Broad Run School District and from then to 1896 was called Farmwell Colored School. Up to 50 students in Grades 1 to 7 were taught there until 1958; in 1959 the property was sold at auction. Loudoun School For The Gifted purchased the building as part of the site for a new school in 2014, and a group of students began restoring it in 2016. After a vandalism incident in 2016, $100,000 was raised through donations and the renovation was completed and the building opened as a museum, with a dedication ceremony held in September 2017 attended by at least one former student and the brother of the last teacher. Seventh-grade students at Farmwell Station Middle School successfully obtained grants and applied to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources for a historical marker at the school. Vandalism incident In September 2016, after the Loudoun School students had raised funds for over a year and had begun renovations by replacing the windows, the building was defaced with graffiti including swastikas, penises and breasts, dinosaurs, and slogans including \\"white power\\" and \\"brown power\\" by five 16- and 17-year-olds, two of them white and the other three minorities. In February 2017 they were ordered by a judge to read one book a month for the next year from a list of 35 books on experiences of discrimination and write a report on each, to listen to an oral history account by a former student at the Ashburn School, to visit the Holocaust Museum and the exhibit on Japanese American internment camps at the Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and write a final 3,500-word essay about the effects of swastikas and white power slogans on African Americans and on the community as a whole, including references to Nazism, lynching, and legal discrimination. Alejandra Rueda, a prosecutor and deputy commonwealth attorney, proposed and worked out the alternative remedy in the belief that education would be more effective than community service, recalling her own upbringing in Guadalajara, Mexico, when she learned about discrimination by reading, beginning with books chosen by her librarian mother. A teacher objected to the use of reading as punishment, and some, particularly members of the black community, saw the disposition as lenient, but Rueda argued that it was more demanding than what juveniles with no prior criminal record would normally receive. The county has since reformed its juvenile justice system and a younger boy has received a reading sentence modeled on the Ashburn School disposition.

Background In March 1952 the US 1st Marine Division was transferred to US I Corps and moved onto the Jamestown Line, the UN's Main line of resistance (MLR) across Korea. The segment of the Jamestown Line assigned to the 1st Marine Division extended southwest from the Samichon River and the left flank of the British 1st Commonwealth Division, crossed the 38th Parallel (the original demarcation between North and South Korea) shifted to the south bank of the Imjin River in the vicinity of Munsan-ni, continued to the conflux of the Imjin and Han River, and then followed the south bank of the Han past the Kimpo Peninsula. Opposing the Marines on the Jamestown Line, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) had the 65th and 63rd Armies, totaling 49,800 troops. Battle =Outpost Siberia (9-10 August)= Shortly after midnight on 9 August, the PVA seized Outpost Siberia (Hill 58A), the site of a squad-size outpost, and also probed the positions of the 1st Marine Regiment. Siberia lay midway between the MLR and the line of PVA outposts. PVA possession of Siberia would provide observation posts to adjust artillery and mortar fire against the nearest segment of the Jamestown Line. As a result, Colonel Walter F. Layer's 1st Marines, on the right of the division's line, counterattacked at once, using the same unit, Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines that had dispatched the squad driven from Siberia. PVA artillery and mortar fire, directed from Hills 110 and 120, stopped the counterattack short of its objective. The Marines called for air strikes and additional artillery fire before renewing the counterattack on Siberia. At 06:50, four F9F jets from the 1st Marine Air Wing struck, dropping Napalm and 500-pound bombs. Shortly before 10:00, Air Force F-80 jets dropped 1,000-pound bombs, and a platoon from Company A, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, the regimental reserve of the 1st Marines, stormed the hill, with the support of a platoon from the 2nd Battalion's Company E. The PVA again replied with mortars and artillery but could not stop the assault, which seized the crest. The supporting platoon from Company E joined in organizing the defense of the recaptured outpost, which came under a deadly torrent of accurate fire that forced the Marines to seek the protection of the reverse slope, nearer the MLR, where they held out until midafternoon before falling back. The PVA's artillery and mortars had fired an estimated 5,000 rounds, wounding or killing three quarters of the Marines who had attacked Siberia on the morning of 9 August. While Companies E and A reorganized the task of recapturing Siberia fell to Company C, which attacked with two platoons starting uphill at 01:16 on 10 August. A firefight erupted, lasting four hours, but the Marines gained the crest and held it until dawn, when driven from Siberia by a PVA counterattack. The losses suffered by the 1st Marines, 17 killed and 243 wounded within 30 hours, convinced Colonel Layer that his regiment could not hold Siberia if Hill 122, nicknamed Bunker Hill, remained in PVA hands. He and his staff planned a sudden thrust at Bunker Hill, possession of which would enable his command to dominate Siberia and observe movement beyond the PVA outpost line. =Battle for Bunker Hill (11-15 August)= To disguise the true objective, Lieutenant Colonel Roy J. Batterton attacked Siberia at dusk on 11 August with one company from his 2nd Battalion. The 1st Tank Battalion supported the maneuver with four M46 Patton tanks each mounting a 90mm gun and an 18-inch searchlight fitted with shutter to highlight a target in a brief burst of illumination, and four M4A3E8 tanks, each carrying a flamethrower. While the M46s hammered Hill 110, the M4A3E8s climbed Siberia, using bursts of flame to light their way and gained the crest before doubling back toward Marine lines. As the flame-throwing M4A3E8 withdrew, the M-46s opened fire on both Siberia and Hill 110, illuminating targets with five-second bursts of light from their shuttered searchlights and Company D overran Siberia, holding the crest until midnight when the diversionary attack ended. The Bunker Hill assault force, Company B, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines under the operational control of Batterton's 2nd Battalion‚Äîreached the crest by 22:30 and began driving the PVA from the slope nearest the MLR. The PVA defenders recovered from their initial surprise, but the bypassed pockets of PVA soldiers, though they tried to resist, could not check the Marine advance. In the wake of the assault force, other Marines and members of the Korean Service Corps manhandled sandbags, wire, and shovels up the hill to help Company B organize the defenses of the objective against the counterattack that was certain to come. PVA mortars and artillery harassed the Marines on Bunker Hill until dawn on 12 August, but the counterattack did not come until mid-afternoon, after Company B passed under the operational control of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines. The defense of Bunker Hill became the responsibility of the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Gerard T. Armitage. The volume and accuracy of the shelling increased at about 15:00, a barrage that lasted an hour and forced the Marines to seek the protection from direct fire afforded by the reverse slope. Company I, 3/1 Marines, reinforced the embattled Company B in time to help break up an attack by some 350 PVA and hold the southern slope of Bunker Hill. While the battle raged on Bunker Hill, 1st Marine Division commander General John T. Selden moved his reserves closer to the fighting. Company I, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, took the place of Company I 3/1 Marines on the MLR, and by the end of the day, all of the 3/7 Marines, had come under the operational control of the 3/1 Marines. Selden attached the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, to strengthen the reserve of the 1st Marines. Meanwhile, Col. Layer moved two provisional platoons from his reserve, the 1st Battalion, to reinforce the 3rd Battalion, and the 3rd Battalion's reconnaissance platoon established an outpost on Hill 124, linking Bunker Hill with the MLR. This shuffling of units proved necessary because the 1st Marine Division was so thinly spread over an extended front. During the realignment, supporting weapons, ranging from machine guns through mortars and artillery to rocket batteries, prepared to box in the Marines holding the near slope of Bunker Hill, hammer the PVA at the crest and beyond, protect the flanks, and harass movement on the routes PVA reinforcements would have to use. As daylight faded into dusk on 12 August, the Marines defending the reverse slope of Bunker Hill struggled to improve their hurriedly prepared fortifications, for the anticipated PVA night counterattack. The comparatively gentle incline of the reverse slope of the ridge that culminated in Bunker Hill reduced the amount of dead space that could not be covered by grazing fire from the Marine position. Moreover, weapons on the Jamestown Line could fire directly onto the crest, when the expected attack began. By 20:00, all the supporting weapons had registered to help the two companies hold the position. Just as the Marines had attacked Siberia on the evening of 11 August to divert attention from Bunker Hill, the PVA sought to conceal the timing of their inevitable counterthrust. Shortly before midnight on the night of 12 August, the PVA probed the division's sector at three points. While one PVA patrol was stumbling into an ambush set by Korean Marines, another harried a Marine outpost east of Bunker Hill. The third and strongest blow, however, landed after midnight at Stromboli, a Marine outpost on Hill 48A northeast of Bunker Hill at the far right of the sector held by the 1st Marine Regiment, near the boundary with the 5th Marine Regiment. In conjunction with the attack on Stromboli, launched in the early hours of August 13, the PVA hit Company F on the right of the line held by the 1st Marines. The PVA failed to crack the Jamestown defenses, but they inflicted so many casualties at Stromboli that reinforcements had to be sent. The reinforcing unit, a squad from Company F, came under mortar and machine gun fire from the PVA probing Company F's defenses and had to return to the MLR. Pressure against Stromboli and its defenders continued until the commander of Company F sent a stronger force that fought its way to the outpost, breaking the PVA encirclement. The 5th Marines moved one company into a blocking position behind the Jamestown Line near Stromboli in case the fighting again flared at that outpost. Meanwhile, the PVA attempted to seize Bunker Hill. At about 01:00 on 13 August, intense PVA artillery and mortar fire persuaded Captain Connolly of Company I to request box-me-in fires, which the 11th Marine Regiment provided immediately. PVA infantry, supported by machine gun fire, advanced behind bursting shells, but the Marines fought back with every weapon they could bring to bear - artillery, mortars, tank guns, rockets, rifles, and automatic weapons. After almost four hours, the violence abated as the PVA relaxed his pressure on Bunker Hill. Company G, 3/7 Marines, joined 3/1 Marines before the PVA broke off the action and withdrew behind a screen of artillery and mortar fire. Except for a determined few, whom the Marines killed, the PVA abandoned Bunker Hill. Colonel Layer took advantage of the lull to send Company H, 3/7 Marines, to relieve the Marines holding the hill. He afterward withdrew all the other elements of the 7th Marines that had reinforced his regiment, but not until a patrol from Company I had reconnoitered the far slope of the hill. In keeping with their usual tactics, the PVA tried to divert attention from Bunker Hill before attacking again. Mortars and artillery shelled Combat Outpost 2, overlooking the Panmunjom corridor on the left of the sector held by the 3/1 Marines, and also harassed the MLR nearby. The main PVA thrust, directed as expected against Bunker Hill, began at about 21:00 on the night of 13 August. While shells still exploded on Combat Outpost 2, the PVA intensified the bombardment of Bunker Hill, which had been under sporadic fire throughout the afternoon. PVA troops hit Company H, attacking simultaneously near the center of the position and on the right flank. High explosive shells boxed in the Marines, and illuminating rounds helped them isolate and kill the few PVA who had penetrated the position. The Chinese battalion that attacked Bunker Hill on the night of 13 August again tested the Marine defenses at 02:25 on 14 August. Before this unit's second attack, a PVA machine gun on Siberia began firing onto Bunker Hill. Marine M-46s illuminated Siberia with briefly with their searchlights and silenced the weapon with 90mm fire, revealing the position of the tanks and enabling PVA artillery fire to wound a crewman of one of them. The 1st Marines responded to the fighting of 13 and 14 August by reinforcing both Bunker Hill and the nearest segment of the Jamestown Line, the so-called Siberia Sector, in anticipation of further PVA attacks. As part of the preparation, Company H, 7th Marines, which still held Bunker Hill, patrolled the slopes where the PVA had launched several attacks but found no Chinese, a situation that rapidly changed. At 01:18 on 15 August, a deluge of PVA artillery began pummeling the Marine position, while PVA infantry jabbed at the defenses. Once again, Marine supporting weapons laid down final protective fires that prevented this latest attack from gaining momentum. The crew of an M-46 tank triggered the shutter of its searchlight and illuminated a force of PVA massing in a draw. Before these soldiers could launch their assault, fire from tanks, artillery, and mortars tore into the group, killing or wounding many and scattering the survivors. Even though Marine-supporting weapons had deflected this planned thrust, the PVA regrouped, called in additional supporting fire and advanced. The bombardment by mortars and artillery attained a volume of 100 rounds per minute before ending at about 04:00, when the PVA apparently realized they could not overwhelm Bunker Hill and called off the attack. When the threat abated, Company H withdrew to the MLR, leaving the defense of Bunker Hill to Company B. The quiet lasted only until late afternoon. At 16:40, the PVA attacked during a thunderstorm, avoiding the use of mortars or artillery, presumably to achieve surprise, but once again the attack failed. The PVA refused, however, to abandon their attempts to seize Bunker Hill. At 00:40 on 16 August, a PVA battalion attacked behind mortar and artillery fire, penetrating to the crest of the hill. Company B which now held the hill, called for reinforcements, and a platoon from Company I, 3/7 Marines, arrived as this assault was ending. The PVA again probed the hill with fire but did not press the attack. Before Company C, 1/1 Marines, Company B, it came under artillery fire three more times. The succession of Marine companies that took over Bunker Hill had to repel seven attacks before the end of August, but only one, on the night of 25‚Äì26 August, threatened to overrun the outpost. The struggle for Bunker Hill cost the Marines 48 killed, 313 seriously wounded, and hundreds of others who suffered minor wounds. The number of known PVA dead exceeded 400 and total casualties may have numbered 3,200. The month ended with Bunker Hill in Marine hands. As the month of August wore on, any lull in the action around Bunker Hill usually coincided with a surge in the fighting elsewhere, usually on the right of the MLR, the segment held by the 5th Marines, commanded after 16 August by Colonel Eustace R. Smoak. On 6 August, while Colonel Culhane still commanded the regiment, the PVA began chipping away at the outpost line in front of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, which consisted of Outposts Elmer, Hilda and Irene. Because the battalion manned the outposts only in daylight, the PVA simply occupied Elmer, farthest to the southwest, after dusk on 6 August and employed artillery fire to seal off the approaches and prevent the Marines from returning after daybreak. The PVA took over Outpost Hilda on the night of 11 August, driving back the Marines sent to reoccupy it the following morning. The same basic tactics enabled the PVA to take over Outpost Irene on the 17th. During an unsuccessful attempt to regain the third of the outposts, Private First Class Robert E. Simanek saved the lives of other Marines by diving onto a PVA hand grenade, absorbing the explosion with his body, suffering severe though not fatal wounds, and earning the Medal of Honor. Heavy rains turned roads into swamps throughout the Marine sector, swept away a bridge over the Imjin River, and forced the closing of a ferry. Bunkers remained largely unaffected by flooding, but the deluge interfered with both air support and combat on the ground. Since the rain fell alike on the UN and PVA forces, activity halted temporarily when fell between 23 and 25 August. Major General Edwin A. Pollock assumed command of the 1st Marine Division on 29 August 1952 and he immediately had to deal with renewed PVA pressure against the Bunker Hill complex, now held by Company E, 2/1 Marines, attached temporarily to the regiment's 3d Battalion. On the night of 4 September, PVA gunners began shelling the outpost and probing its right flank, but small arms fire forced the enemy to pull back. The resulting lull lasted only until 01:00 on 5 September, when PVA mortars and artillery resumed firing, concentrating on Bunker Hill. Apparently confident that the barrage had neutralized the defenses, the attackers ignored cover and concealment and moved boldly into an unexpected hail of fire that drove them back. After regrouping, the PVA attacked once again, this time making use of every irregularity in the ground and employing the entire spectrum of weapons from hand grenades to artillery. This latest effort went badly awry when a force trying to outflank Bunker Hill lost its way and drew fire from Marines on the MLR. The attackers tried to correct their mistake only to come under fire from their fellow PVA who had penetrated the extreme right of Bunker Hill's defenses and may have mistaken their comrades for counterattacking Marines. Amid the confusion Company E surged forward and drove the PVA from the outpost. The Marines of Company E suffered 12 killed and 40 wounded in routing a PVA battalion while killing an estimated 335 PVA. =Outpost Bruce (5-6 September)= Yet another diversionary attack on Outpost Stromboli coincided with the thrust against Bunker Hill. The Marines defending Stromboli sustained no casualties in breaking up an attack by a PVA platoon supported by machine guns. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 5th Marines fought to defend their outpost line from Allen in the west, through Bruce, Clarence, Donald, Felix, and Gary, to Jill in the east against a succession of attacks that began in the early hours of 5 September. At Outpost Bruce, manned by Company I, 3/5 Marines, under Captain Edward Y. Holt, Jr., a company of attacking infantry followed up a savage barrage. Private First Class Alford L. McLaughlin killed or wounded an estimated 200 PVA, victims of the machine guns, carbines and grenades that he used at various times during the fight, and survived to receive the Medal of Honor. Private First Class Fernando L. Garcia, also earned the award, although already wounded, he threw himself on a PVA grenade, sacrificing his life to save his platoon sergeant. Hospitalman Third Class Edward C. Benfold saw two wounded Marines in a shell hole on Outpost Bruce; as he prepared to attend to them, a pair of grenades thrown by two onrushing PVA soldiers fell inside the crater. Benfold picked up one grenade in each hand, scrambled from the hole, and pressed a grenade against each of the two soldiers. The explosions killed both the Chinese, as Benfold sacrificed himself to save the two wounded Marines, earning a posthumous Medal of Honor. When dawn broke on 5 September, Company I still clung to Outpost Bruce, even though only two bunkers, both on the slope nearest the Jamestown Line, survived destruction by mortar and artillery shells. Reinforcements, construction and other supplies, and ammunition were rushed to the battered outpost despite harassing fire directed at the trails leading there. Marine and Air Force pilots tried to suppress the PVA gunners with 10 air strikes that dropped napalm as well as high explosive. On the morning of 6 September, the defenders of Outpost Bruce beat off another attack, finally calling for box-me-in fires that temporarily put an end to infantry assaults. At dusk, however, the PVA again bombarded the outpost, this time for an hour, before attacking with infantry while directing long-range fire at neighboring Outpost Allen to the southwest. The Marines defending Outpost Bruce survived to undergo further attack on the early morning of 7 September. Two PVA companies tried to envelop the hilltop, using demolitions in an attempt to destroy any bunkers not yet shattered by the latest shelling. For a total of 51 hours, the PVA besieged Outpost Bruce before breaking off the action by sunrise on the 7th. At Bruce, the site of the deadliest fighting in this sector, the Marines suffered 19 killed and 38 wounded PVA killed and wounded at Outpost Bruce may have totalled 400. In late September, the PVA again attacked the combat outposts manned by Colonel Layer's 1st Marines, especially Hill 122 (Bunker Hill) and Hill 124 at the southwestern tip of the same ridge line. The PVA struck first at Hill 124, attacking by flare-light from four directions but failing to dislodge the squad dug in there, even though most of the Marines suffered at least minor wounds. The entire ridge from Hill 124 to Hill 122 remained under recurring attack for the remainder of September, especially Bunker Hill itself, where the PVA clung to advance positions as close as to Marine trenches. The PVA frequently probed Bunker Hill's defenses by night, and the Marines took advantage of darkness to raid PVA positions, using portable flamethrowers and demolitions to destroy bunkers while fire from tanks and artillery discouraged counterattacks. Aftermath As October began, heavier PVA shelling, the prelude to a series of attacks on outposts all across the division front from the Korean Marine Corps on the left, past the 1st Marines and Bunker Hill, to the far right, where the 7th Marine Regiment, had taken over from the 5th Marines, now in reserve. To make communications more secure, The 7th Marines redesignated Outposts Allen, Bruce, Clarence, Donald, Gary and Jill, replacing proper names, in alphabetical order, with the randomly arranged names of cities: Carson, Reno, Vegas, Berlin, Detroit, Frisco, and Seattle. The first three outposts would becomes known as the Nevada Complex and would be the scene of further intensive fighting in the coming months. Despite regular small ambushes and artillery attacks UN forces would hold Bunker Hill until the end of the war. As Bunker Hill lay within the Korean Demilitarized Zone set out in the Korean Armistice Agreement the Marines had only 72 hours after the ceasefire began to evacuate the position. Moreover, anything salvaged from Bunker Hill had to travel over a primitive road described as \\"particularly tortuous,\\" which made the transfer \\"of first the ammunition and then the fortification materials a physical ordeal.\\"  References  Conflicts in 1952 Battles of the Korean War Battles of the Korean War involving China August 1952 events United States Marine Corps in the 20th century ","title":"Battle of Bunker Hill (1952)"},{"id":"60516655","text":"The Europe Zone was one of the two regional zones of the 1947 Davis Cup. 20 teams entered the Europe Zone, with the winner going on to compete in the Inter-Zonal Final against the winner of the America Zone.

The school was again renamed Horley Methodist School in 1962. History Established originally as a Government school which passed into the control of the Methodist Mission in 1899, due to the efforts of the Reverend W E Horley who was based in Ipoh and had founded the Anglo-Chinese School, Ipoh in 1895. The Teluk Anson school was an attap thatched building on stilts, enclosed with weather boarding of split bamboo. In 1904, Rev. Horley held a meeting of the leading residents of Teluk Anson in the Lower Perak Chinese Club and collected funds to put up a bigger and better school. In 1913, the new school building was completed and officiated in commemoration of the Coronation of King George V. The school progressed gradually, and by the 1910 Teluk Anson's conservatism being pushed aside, Indian and Chinese sought admission for their daughters in that school since there was no girls‚Äô school in the town. The school remained a co-educational school; until long afterwards when a ruling by the Senior Inspector of Schools, Perak, in 1938 compelled all the girls to leave and go over to the Convent School. Secondary education commenced in the school as early as 1922 with a few boys taking the Senior Cambridge Examination. In 1930 the school underwent an extension due to its rapid growth.

He was the ancestor of Harisimhadeva. He established his capital in Simraungadh and ruled the greater Mithila region for 50 years. He is known for his generosity, courage, and patronage of scholars. He was from Karna Kshatriya Kula and began to rule Mithila from Simraungadh in 1097 CE. The stone inscription found at Simraongarh and NepƒÅlava·πÉ≈õƒÅvalƒ´Kamal P. Malla (1985).

Etymology and names Nanya is a word of Karnatic origin and Sanskritised form of Nanniya. Nanyadeva means \\"the dearest of god\\" (Nanya means \\"dearest\\" and deva means \\"god\\"). The Andhratharhi inscription of his minister, Shridhardas refers Nanyadeva as Mahasamantadhipati, Dharmamavaloka and Sriman Nanyapati. Early life It is believed that Nanyadeva arrived in the region as part of the Chalukaya invasions of the North during the second half of the 11th century. The Chalukyas would likely have been accompanied by many military adventurers who carved out small principalities of their own in North Bihar and Nanyadeva would have been among them. His original stronghold was Nanapura in Champaran district of Bihar however he later shifted his capital to Simraungadh in modern-day Nepal which would remain as the main capital until the end of the Karnat dynasty. Rule of Mithila In Vidyapati's Purush Pariksa, Nanyadeva is confirmed to have gained control of Mithila by 1097 CE. During his rule, Mithila came into conflict with the Pala dynasty of Bengal. Legacy Many modern scholars, as well as the people of the region, view Nanyadeva as a \\"son of Mithila\\" who liberated the region following the fall of the Videhan monarchy. The Karnata rule is not viewed as foreign as they established their power in Mithila itself, unlike others who ruled from outside. he was succeeded by two sons, Gangadeva and Malladeva. =Literary works= He cultivated several melodies and recorded his knowledge in the Sanskrit musicological treatise called the Sarasvati Hridayalankara and the Grantha-Maharnava. These works are an in-depth assessment of different musical notes and how they can lead to certain feelings and sentiments ranging from heroism to anger. He completed these works following his ascendance to power in Mithila. Descendants Many Rajput zamindars in North Bihar (which is part of the Mithila region), especially in Saharsa district claim Nanyadeva to be their ancestor.

Belonging to the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it is part of Kafj√§rden Parish in the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s. Until 1995, it was the main church of the historical J√§der Parish.  Architecture  J√§der Church is a significant work of Swedish renaissance architecture, and is sometimes locally jokingly referred to as Rekarne domkyrka, \\"Rekarne Cathedral\\", owing to its unusually large size for a village church and extensive renaissance decorations. The church is situated on a hill surrounded by fields and built in stone and brick. It consists of a western nave, a choir of similar dimensions in the east, a sacristy to the north, the Brahe burial chapel opposite the sacristy to the south, a church porch and a western tower. The burial chapel and the sacristy form the arms of a latin cross. The walls have pointed arched windows, and the gabled roof is covered in roof slate. The western tower is crowned by a multi-levelled Neo-Renaissance spire. The exterior is mainly characterised by the brick walls and mid-17th century ornamental sandstone decorations on the gables.  Interior  Altarpiece by Jan Borman and Jan van Coninxlo. The white-washed walls and vaults give the church interior a largely uniform appearance, although the vaults range in age from the late Middle Ages to the 17th century. The choir has more marked gothic influences. There are several epitaphs for local nobility created in the 17th century by Heinrich Wilhelm. The late Gothic winged altarpiece in Brabant style was originally commissioned for Storkyrkan in Stockholm and is one of the foremost examples of this altarpiece style in Sweden, built 1514 in Jan Borman's workshop in Brussels and painted by Jan van Coninxlo the Younger.  History  The northern wall incorporates parts of a Romanesque 12th century church which was expanded upon during the second half of the 13th century, likely using an aisleless design, with the original medieval porch and sacristy. The tower and vaults were added during the 15th century. During the patronship of Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna the church was significantly expanded upon and rebuilt, in order to serve as the burial church of the Chancellor and his family. The choir with the Oxenstierna burial vault was rebuilt between 1641 and 1643. In 1651‚Äì1652 the present sacristy and porches were added and the Brahe burial chapel was finished in 1659 to mirror the sacristy. The spire has been replaced several times over the course of the history of the church. The present spire was designed in Neo-Renaissance style by Helgo Zettervall and finished in 1880.  Burials  Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna (1583-1654) J√§der Church was used by the influential Oxenstierna family of nearby Fiholm Castle as a burial church for several generations, and owes it present renaissance appearance mainly to the Swedish statesman Axel Oxenstierna, who commissioned the extensive mid-17th century additions to the church. The Brahe burial chapel and vault was commissioned by Margareta Brahe for the remains of her two first husbands, Bengt Bengtsson Oxenstierna and Johan Oxenstierna, and finished in 1659. * Anna √Ökesdotter B√•√•t (1579-1649), Countess of S√∂derm√∂re and wife to Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna, Maid of honour to Dowager Queen Catherine Stenbock. * Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna af S√∂derm√∂re (1583-1654), Count of S√∂derm√∂re, Privy Councillor and statesman, Lord High Chancellor of Sweden 1612-1654 * Axel Eriksson Oxenstierna af S√∂derm√∂re (1652-1676), Count of S√∂derm√∂re * Bengt Bengtsson Oxenstierna af Eka och Lind√∂ (1591-1643), Privy Councillor and diplomat, Governor-General of Ingria and Livonia * Carl Gustaf Oxenstierna af S√∂derm√∂re (1655-1686), Count of S√∂derm√∂re, diplomat * Erik Axelsson Oxenstierna af S√∂derm√∂re (1624-1656), Count of S√∂derm√∂re, Privy Councillor and statesman, Lord High Chancellor of Sweden 1654-1656 * Johan Oxenstierna af S√∂derm√∂re (1611‚Äì1657), Count of S√∂derm√∂re, Privy Councillor and statesman, Lord Marshal of the Realm * Clas Tott (1630-1674), Count of Karleborg, Field Marshal, Privy Councillor, Governor-General of Livonia  References  :This article incorporates material translated from the article J√§ders kyrka on Swedish Wikipedia. * Churches in S√∂dermanland County Churches in the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s ","title":"J√§der Church"},{"id":"60516779","text":"Terry Murphy is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s.

Proclamation During the Bonn Challenge 3.0 high-level meeting in March 2018, El Salvador announced plans to propose a United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021‚Äì2030, aimed at boosting existing efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. El Salvador's leadership on ecosystem restoration arose out of its support for the Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares of degraded ecosystems globally by 2030, and endorsement of the New York Declaration on Forests. As one of the six Bonn Challenge pilot countries, El Salvador has pledged to restore 1 million hectares, equivalent to half of the country‚Äôs territory. 71 countries supported the proposal at its presentation by El Salvador‚Äôs Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, Lina Pohl, to the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018. On 1 March 2019, the UN General Assembly officially adopted the resolution declaring 2021‚Äì2030 the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration. According to Minister Pohl, ‚ÄúEcosystem restoration promoted through this UN Decade takes a multi-functional landscape approach, looking at the mosaic of interdependent land uses in which ecological, economic, social, and development-based priorities can find convergence, balance, and complementarity.\\" Rationale The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 will focus on balancing ecological, social and developmental priorities in landscapes where different forms of land use interact, with the aim of fostering long term resilience. An ecosystem includes all living organisms, and their interaction with each other and their physical environment (such as soil, climate, atmosphere, and weather). Each organism plays a key role and contributes to the health and productivity of the ecosystem as a whole. Ecosystems are interdependent, and damage or imbalance can have devastating and far-reaching consequences. Biodiversity underlies all ecosystem services, which are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems, indispensable to health, survival and wellbeing. They include provisioning services (food, freshwater, wood and fibre, and fuel), regulating services (modulating climate, disease, food supply, and water purity), and cultural services (serving aesthetic, spiritual, and educational needs). Human activities are affecting the capacity of ecosystems to provide these goods and services. Drivers of biodiversity loss and decline in ecosystem functioning include climate change, deforestation, desertification and land degradation, freshwater decline, overexploitation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and pollution. Degradation of land and marine ecosystems adds to the threat of mass species extinction, and has a negative impact on the well-being of some 3.2 billion people, costing around 10% of the annual global gross domestic product (c. $6.3 trillion) in loss of species and ecosystem services. Agricultural land and ecosystem degradation reduces resilience to climate change, which enhances the risk of catastrophic collapse in the face of rising temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns. The benefits future generations can obtain from ecosystems will be greatly diminished unless these problems are addressed. Ecosystem restoration seeks to repair some of the damage done to ecosystems and biodiversity. It assists the recovery of degraded, damaged and destroyed ecosystems, to regain ecological functionality and provide goods and services of value to humans. The beneficial effects of ecosystem restoration include increased food and water security, contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and managing the associated risks of conflict and migration. The restoration of 350 million hectares of degraded terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by 2030 could generate US$9 trillion in ecosystem services and remove 13 to 26 gigatons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The benefits obtained from ecosystem generation on average exceed the costs of the initial investment tenfold, whereas the cost of inaction is at least three times the cost of ecosystem restoration. Opportunity and aims Around 2 billion hectares of degraded lands worldwide have potential for ecosystem restoration. Most of the rehabilitation work could take the form of ‚Äúmosaic restoration‚Äù, in which forests are combined with protected areas, agriculture, waterbodies, and human settlements on a landscape-wide scale. Transformational ecosystem restoration requires strong commitment, and the efforts of countries, the international community, civil society, the private sector, and other actors. Achieving the Bonn Challenge objective of restoring at least 350 million hectares of degraded landscapes by 2030 could realize up to $9 trillion in net benefits, and alleviate poverty in many rural communities. The UN Decade aims to promote a concerted and holistic landscape- focused approach to the interdependence of ecosystems, human needs, and biodiversity, to accelerate the progress needed to maintain and restore ecosystems. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration was established in order to: *Build a common vision, prioritizing ecosystem restoration from the global to the local level to accelerate reversal of ecosystem degradation *Mainstream ecosystem restoration in policy and planning to address current developmental challenges due to land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change vulnerability *Foster a holistic approach to achieving international commitments and national priorities through ecosystem and landscape restoration *Enhance cooperation and resource mobilization to increase the flow of financial resources, technologies, knowledge, and capacity building to countries and jurisdictions working to meet national goals and international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals, through ecosystem restoration *Encourage partnerships and investments, promoting a resilient economy by increasing support for smallholders' generation of value from land use products and potential to contribute to ecosystem restoration *Promote cooperation between funds providers, governments, civil society, and the private sector to help overcome barriers to scaling up resource-efficient productive systems in association with ecosystem restoration *Raise awareness of the importance of functional ecosystems for human well-being and productive activities, local development and the economic sustainability of society Links to other initiatives Ecosystem restoration is recognized as a key component in achieving targets under existing international conventions and agreements. These include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and, under it, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and its target of Land Degradation Neutrality, the Ramsar Convention, and the United Nations Strategic Plan on Forests 2017 ‚Äì 2030. Ecosystem restoration will contribute to all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, in particular to SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Paragraph 27 of the Ministerial Declaration of the High-Level Political Forum on the SDGs held in July 2018 sets out commitments made to achieve sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally by 2020. Planned activities during the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration are also designed to contribute to the Bonn Challenge to restore degraded and deforested land. The UN Decade builds on regional restoration efforts, such as Initiative 20x20 in Latin America, which aims to restore 20 million hectares of degraded land by 2020; and the AFR100 African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, that aims to bring 100 million hectares of degraded land under restoration by 2030. Ecosystem restoration resolutions Resolutions relevant to ecosystem restoration adopted during past Environment Assemblies (UNEA) of the United Nations Environment Program (UN Environment) include: * UNEP/EA.1/L.08 Ecosystem-based adaptation * UNEP/EA.2/L.24 Combating desertification, land degradation and drought and promoting sustainable pastoralism and rangelands * UNEP/EA.3/L.10 Addressing water pollution to protect and restore water-related ecosystems The following resolutions adopted during the fourth UNEA, from 11 to 15 March 2019, highlight the importance of ecosystem restoration: * UNEP/EA.4/L.11 Innovations on biodiversity and land degradation * UNEP/EA.4/L.19 Conservation and Sustainable Management of Peatlands * UNEP/EA.4/L.14 Sustainable coral reefs management * UNEP/EA.4/L.13 Sustainable Management for Global Health of Mangrove Key bodies and partners UN Environment and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) will lead the implementation of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Other key bodies and forums involved are the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Global Landscapes Forum (GLF). In supporting the UN Decade, they will partner with other UN agencies, bodies and convention secretariats, and with international and indigenous organisations.

In its own publicity material it is described as \\"not a museum in the classical sense, but an interactive experience that thrills its visitors and seeks to offer constantly new experiences through special exhibitions and changing presentations ...\\". Biography Karl-Heinz Rehkopf was born and grew up in Fredelsloh, a picturesque village in the hills between Hanover and Kassel. His father was the manager of the small dairy which his parents ran together. There was an awareness, as he grew up, that the family was not wealthy. Nevertheless, by the time he was 11, in 1947, his father had acquired a car, and he would later recall that thanks to the reassuringly indulgent approach of the local policemen, even at the age of eleven he enjoyed being permitted to steer and later, long before reaching the legal minimum driving age of 18, drive his father's prewar Opel, provided he did not stray outside the village. Around the time he was 20 his father died. In any event, he always had to work in order to support himself first in order to buy his first motor-bike \\"to impress the girls\\", then to obtain a qualification in business administration and later to support his young family. In 1961 - reportedly on a whim - he and his first wife took over the village store in the nearby village of Elliehausen. He had purchased the motorbike in 1952 for 100 Marks. It was a 1938 Victoria V99. In 1972 Rehkopf teamed up with Rainer Wunderlich to establish \\"Teppich-Dom√§ne Harste\\" (\\"loosely, \\"Carpet World Hartse\\"\\"), a discount retailer of carpet-tiles and other floor coverings and furnishings. The business was installed in buildings previously used to accommodate cattle, pigs and horses, while the manor house was adapted for administrative use, on a former landed estate in the village of Harste, not far from G√∂ttingen. Forty-five years later, rebranded in 2007 as \\"tedox\\", the range had expanded, but with the focus still on home furnishing and redecoration. Around the same time the Rehkopf family withdrew from active involvement in the firm. There are now (2017) more than 100 retail outlets and approximately 2,800 employees. In 2009 Karl-Heinz Rehkopf set up the \\"Kulturstiftung Kornhaus\\" (literally, \\"Grain Silo arts foundation\\") in the little town of Einbeck, introducing into it 40 Million Euros of his own money. The project for which the foundation had been created involved converting the PS Speicher, a brick-built grain silo constructed to the west of the town (but subsequently subsumed into it) in the 1890s. Between 2012 and 2014 the structure was thoroughly cleaned and the interior reconfigured. On 23 July 2014 it opened as a modern museum of cars and motorbikes produced during the preceding 130 years. Most of the 2,000 old- timer bikes and cars were initially from Rehkopf's own collection. In April 2015 a press release announced that during its first nine months as a \\"museum\\" the PS Speicher had attracted 50,000 visitors. The announcement was accompanied by a picture of a surprised but happy family from Korbach, the wife clutching a large bouquet of flowers and the daughter a large bag of free souvenirs, with the museum director Alexander Fillies looking on. It was not clear from the press release which of the five family members was visitor number 50,000. Beyond the PS Speicher project, Rehkopf has made numerous philanthropic donations. On 7 December 2016, his eightieth birthday, in the presence of around 500 guests, Sabine Michalek, the mayor of Einbeck awarded him the town's \\"ring of honour\\", the highest award in her gift. Those who were there to congratulate him included Bernd Busemann, vice-president of the regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\") Personal From his first marriage Rehkopf has two sons and one daughter. In 2004 he married, as his second wife, the Berlin art historian Gabriele Rehkopf-Adt.

It was originally released in 1995 as a benefit single for Italian anti-AIDS associations LILA (Lega italiana per la lotta contro l'AIDS, in English \\"Italian League for the Fight against AIDS\\") and ANLAIDS (Associazione nazionale per la lotta all'AIDS, in English \\"National AIDS-fighting Association\\") and subsequently included in the band's compilation Peerla. Superficially intended as a genuine Christmas song, the track is actually a lighthearted parody of the genre, as well as a send-up of charity songs, with particular reference to \\"We Are the World\\". Structure and lyrics The song starts with an introduction by keyboardist Sergio Conforti (a.k.a. Rocco Tanica), who uses a synthesized French horn timbre ‚Äì similar to the one used by Quincy Jones at the very start of \\"We Are the World\\" ‚Äì to play two short quotes from \\"Jingle Bells\\" and \\"White Christmas\\"; this is followed by a piano passage vaguely reminiscent of Roberto Vecchioni's 1971 song \\"Luci a San Siro\\", after which Romani starts singing in a deliberately hoarse voice and a dramatic tone. The lyrics to the song are written in an over-simplified form of English, with a few lines in Italian, as a satirical list of stereotypical Italian traditions during the Christmas holiday period. Elio sings three lines in the second verse, while the choruses are sung by Romani with the rest of the band ‚Äì joined, on the final chorus, by various DJs and hosts from Radio Deejay (specifically uncredited), who perform in the style of a gospel choir, with additional percussion and handclaps. Before the ending chorus, the song also features a melodic guitar solo by guitarist Davide Civaschi, a.k.a. Ces√†reo. = Lyrics = :I am in the room, waiting for Santa and for Claus. *Santa Claus is jokingly referred to as two separate people, and \\"Claus\\" is pronounced like the German name \\"Klaus\\" [i.e. KLAH-oos], rather than the English \\"clause\\". :Suddenly by night they will arrive, :Can't you feel the typical cling-cling-cling-cling-cling? *Immediately after \\"by night\\", the band shouts out \\"By night! By night! By night! By night!\\", starting much faster than the main beat and speeding up. This was a recurring gag on the band's comedy show Cordialmente on Radio Deejay. Also, on the second line quoted above, Romani uses the verb feel instead of hear - a possible ironical reference to a literal but wrong Italian-to-English translation, which recurs in several other lines. :Presents for the good, coal for the bad, :Proprio come diceva mia mamma! *The Italian line above means \\"Just like my mom said!\\" and is sung by Romani in a forced North American accent, like the rest of his vocals. Black-colored, coal-shaped rock candies are traditionally given as a gift to \\"naughty\\" children at Epiphany, rather than Christmas. :Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want, :Peace between Blur and Oasis! :Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want, :Don't throw atomic bombs because it's Christmas time! *The first line in the chorus is another intentional Italian-to-English mistranslation - in this case, of the well-known Italian proverb Natale con i tuoi, Pasqua con chi vuoi [i.e. (Spend) Christmas with your family/folks, Easter with whoever you want]. The first half of the line is a literal word-by-word translation of the Italian original, while, in the second half, Elio (who wrote the lyrics) jokingly simplified the unmetrical \\"whoever\\" into \\"what\\". The chorus also mentions the feud between British bands Blur and Oasis during their 1990s Britpop phase, and, in the fourth line quoted above, it satirizes the notorious French nuclear tests on Moruroa, particularly the 1995 ones conducted by then-President Jacques Chirac. :Panettone is on the table, and everybody's drinking Moscato Panettone is the traditional Christmas cake from Milan. The first half of the line is a parody of \\"The book is on the table\\", one of the first English sentences which Italian schoolboys learning English are usually taught; the word Moscato, the name of a famous Italian sparkling wine, is pronounced as Moss-KAY-doh, again in a strong American accent. :Go to buy a tree, but not a true tree, :Because otherwise it would die-die-die-die- die! :Panettone is on the table, but it is another one. *All of the above lines are sung by Elio in a very non-English, exaggeratedly Italian accent (with hints of Milanese). In his first line, continuing with his intentional mistranslations, he sings true rather than real, then pronounces \\"die-die-die- die-die\\" as \\"d√†i-d√†i-d√†i-d√†i-d√†i\\", in the style of an incitation from a football head coach to players on the field (meaning c'mon, c'mon, c'mon... in Italian). Romani resumes his vocal on the following line. :Infatti √® quello senza canditi! :Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want, :Peace between Lino and Cecchetto! :Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want, :Don't drop atomic bombs, at least at Christmas time! *Romani's Italian line above, meaning Indeed it's the one without candied fruit!, completes Elio's previous reference to \\"Panettone [...] another one\\": it is both a slight satire of a 1995 holiday season advert, featuring comedy actress Franca Valeri, for a panettone without candied fruit which Veronese firm Melegatti had just launched at the time, and a jocular reference to the ensuing debate in Italy between admirers of Melegatti's new version of the Milanese cake and traditionalists, who viewed it as a betrayal of a long-established Christmas tradition. The second chorus goes on to mention Radio Deejay host Pasquale Di Molfetta, known as Linus, and founder Claudio Cecchetto; at the time, the latter was on the verge of splitting from Radio Deejay because of a heated contractual dispute between him, Di Molfetta and other broadcasters; Cecchetto would go on to found his own radio station, called Radio Capital (unconnected to the UK network). The two names are respectively pronounced by Romani as LINE-oh and say-shadow. *During Ces√†reo's guitar solo, Romani sings the following lines - the fourth one, below, meaning Do you know what my mom said? :Oh, it's Christmas time, :Please don't drop the bomb, don't drop it! :Proprio come diceva mia mamma. :Sai come diceva mia mamma? After the solo, Romani and the choir from Radio Deejay (mentioned above) sing a gospel rendition of the \\"Lino and Cecchetto\\" version of the chorus; Romani concludes with \\"Living the refreshing world of Christmas!\\" and \\"Monsieur Chirac, garde la bombe avec toi!\\". The intentional malapropism refreshing alludes to a jingle for Italy's popular \\"Brooklyn\\" brand of chewing gum (\\"Feel the refreshing world of Brooklyn!\\"), sung by Romani himself in 1980, while the French line, meaning Mister Chirac, keep the bomb to yourself!, is another and more explicit reference to Chirac's controversial 1995 nuclear test. On his very last line, Romani also quotes Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown's 1984 song \\"Unity\\", by shouting \\"Peace! Love! Unity! And having fun!\\" Track listing All tracks written by Elio, Rocco Tanica, Ces√†reo and Faso [a.k.a. Nicola Fasani]. #\\"Christmas with the Yours\\" #\\"Christmas with the Yours (Get Far mix)\\" #\\"Christmas with the Yours (Say Shadow Puppastic Mix)\\" *Track 1 is the original mix, later included on Peerla; track 2 is a house/techno remix by DJ Mario Fargetta; track 3 is the same as track 1, but slightly extended and overlaid with spoken Christmas greetings by Radio Deejay hosts and broadcasters ‚Äì not including Claudio Cecchetto. On the track, DJ Paola Pelagalli, a.k.a. Paoletta, in true broadcaster style, manages to slip in her greeting between two sung lines - namely, Elio's third (and final) solo line and Romani's re-starting line. The artwork for the single features the song's title displayed on a large chocolate Easter egg ‚Äì another intentional malapropism ‚Äì made by pastry maker Pasticceria Colzani in Cassago Brianza.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The construction of the bridge, as a multi-span stone masonry arch type, is extremely rare in Michigan because of the lack of good sources of stone material. It is the longest known stone highway bridge in Michigan. History The Marshall Avenue Bridge was likely constructed in about 1899, using material from a deposit of sandstone near Marshall. The bridge was renovated in 1951, with much of its surface coated with concrete, greatly detracting from the aesthetics of the original design. It was renovated again in 1996, and the concrete was removed. The bridge is in good repair and open to traffic. Description Marshall Avenue Bridge at street level The Marshall Avenue Bridge is a stone masonry-arch bridge with three 25-foot spans. It has a 42-foot-wide deck, which holds a 35-foot-wide roadway and two sidewalks on either side. The entire length off the structure is 82 feet. The stonework of the bridge rises above the roadway to create solid railings along each side of the bridge, topped by concrete coping. The stonework also extends beyond each end of the bridge into the abutments and flared wing walls. Below the roadway, the spans are defined by broad archivolts outlined by narrow voussoirs. The surface of the arch barrels are lined with concrete.

Early life and high school career Mac Jones was born September 5, 1998 to parents Gordon and Holly Jones. His father played tennis at Florida State University and Flagler College his senior year. Jones led Flagler to the NAIA national championship in 1977 and later played professionally throughout the United States. His love of sports was passed on to Mac and his two siblings, both of whom played collegiate sports. Mac's brother, Will, played soccer at Mercer University while his sister Sarah Jane played tennis for the College of Charleston. At the age of 5, Jones signed up for his first Pop Warner football team, which spawned a love of football. While he played other sports, his favorite was clear and from the time he was five years old, his mother would find him drawing out football plays. Jones received Pop Warner Scholar recognition in his youth and as he approached middle school, Coach Joe Dickinson began mentoring Mac to become an elite quarterback. Jones played his high school football at The Bolles School where he was coached by Corky Rogers. Entering his sophomore season, Jones attended the GAIN Sports Bus Tour visiting up to 20 colleges over 8 days which helped Mac earn a scholarship from the University of Kentucky before his junior season.

The Chinese name of the newspaper is Xƒ´n Jƒ´ng B√†o (), meaning \\"New Beijing News\\", which is a reference to the defunct Peking Gazette (). The Chinese publications serial number of the newspaper is CN11-0245. History The Beijing News began publishing on 11 November 2003 by a joint venture of Guangming Daily Press and Nanfang Media Group (also transliterated as \\"Southern Newspaper Group\\" or Southern Daily Press Group), both owned by the sub-committees of the Chinese Communist Party, the ruling party of China since 1949. Guangming Daily Press was owned by the Central Committee while Nanfang Media Group was owned by the Guangdong provincial committee of the Party. Initially, staff from Nanfang Media Group dominated the day-to-day operation of the newspaper, turning The Beijing News into one of Beijing's most influential newspapers. According to Dr. Jonathan Hassid, an assistant professor (from 2015 to 2018) at Iowa State University, the two publishers had different difficulties in their publishing business. Guangming Daily had a valuable central-level administrative rank but was the country poorest major publisher, while \\"Nanfang\\" had money to invest but its administrative rank was restricting the publisher to obtain new publication number or expand outside their home province Guangdong. According to another article by Congressional- Executive Commission on China, \\"the Guangming Daily consistently follows the Party's line, while the Southern Daily Press Group's publications tend to be more commercially-oriented and willing to test Chinese censors\\". In 2005, staff and online readers protested the sacking of the editors of the newspaper. In July 2011, the newspaper defied the ban on reporting Wenzhou train collision. However, in the same month, the newspaper scrapped 9 pages of special reporting. On 1 September 2011, the newspaper was taken over by the Publicity Department of the . In 2013, it was reported that Dai Zigeng, a publisher of the newspaper, had verbally resigned due to political pressure from the propaganda authorities. In 2014, it was reported that the Publicity Department had acquired the remaining 49% stake from Nanfang Media Group. According to the South China Morning Post, an English newspaper from Hong Kong, general public were feared that The Beijing News would turned into a \\"propaganda mouthpiece\\".

Richard Allen Schools. Retrieved on April 17, 2019. \\"118 W. 1st Street, Suite 620, Dayton, OH 45402\\" It operates schools in Dayton and Hamilton. It was named after the founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) and a former slave, Richard Allen. History Jeanette Harris and Reverend Earl Harris established Richard Allen in August 1999 in Dayton. The first campus was in the Edgemont neighborhood. The former became the president and CEO of the school system. For a period Institute of Management and Resources (IMR) operated the school, and Michelle Thomas served as the superintendent. In 2009 the school system gave more than $1 million to consultancy firms established by Jeanette Harris; state taxpayers sent over $6.5 million to the system that year. Dave Yost, the Ohio Auditor of State, ruled that Richard Allen paid $1.5 million in money to IMR in excess of what it should have; IMR sued Yost, but the 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals, on December 10, 2015, upheld the decision. A new audit in 2013 stated that IMR had overcharged an additional $452,281, meaning the total overspent funds were now $2.2 million. In the summer of 2017 IMR stopped its operations of the schools, and IMR filed for bankruptcy in March 2018. Richard Allen became the sole charter school system operated by EDMG, established in April 2017. In 2018 the Ohio Department of Education stated that it would no longer sponsor the school system. In 2019 legal proceedings had been opened against both Thomas and IMR. Schools * Richard Allen Preparatory (Dayton) - One K-3 campus and one 4-8 campus ** the Dayton campuses had a total of about 500 students. The two buildings were both on Salem Avenue, with about between them. Previously the Dayton schools were organized as Richard Allen I, II and Prep. * Richard Allen Academy (Hamilton) - K-6 ** it had 160 students. It was previously known as Richard Allen III. Student body the school system had a total of 525 students. Previously it had a total enrollment of 964; its 2013 enrollment was around that size. Academic performance In 2013 the Dayton campuses had academic performances superior to those of schools of Dayton Public Schools while the Hamilton campus had academic performances inferior to those of schools of the Hamilton City School District. In 2011 Christopher Magan and Margo Rutledge Kissell of the Dayton Daily News stated that the school system was \\"known for the type of strong academic performance that would make any urban educator envious.\\" References Further reading * External links * Richard Allen Schools Charter schools in Ohio Education in Dayton, Ohio Education in Butler County, Ohio Buildings and structures in Hamilton, Ohio 1999 establishments in Ohio Educational institutions established in 1999 ","title":"Richard Allen Schools"},{"id":"60517354","text":"The SMI Expanded is a capitalization-weighted stock index of large-cap and mid-cap companies listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

It comprises a section of the old poblacion of Para√±aque along the south bank of the Para√±aque River by its mouth on the Manila Bay. The coastal village encompasses the area from Don Galo on the north, Santo Ni√±o (former Ibayo) and Moonwalk on the east and San Dionisio on the south. A portion of Global Airport Business Park along C-5 Road Extension is also under the jurisdiction of La Huerta. It also extends west to the reclaimed area in Manila Bay and covers the northernmost section of Freedom Island in the Las Pi√±as‚ÄìPara√±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area. As of the 2015 census, it had a population of 9,569. History Old fa√ßade of the Para√±aque Cathedral The village was named for the presence of an orchard in the area during the Spanish colonial period. The first known European to discover the area of La Huerta was a Catholic missionary, Fray Juan de Orto of the Order of Saint Augustine, who arrived in 1575. Five years later, La Huerta was established as the center of the Augustinian missionary town of Para√±aque. It was also in 1580 when the mission convent of San Andr√©s el Apost√≥l (later rebuilt as the Saint Andrew Cathedral) was completed under the leadership of Fray Diego de Espinar as its first superior. Out of this settlement grew the visitas and towns of Don Galo, Tambo, San Dionisio and Las Pi√±as in southern Manila Province which was then transferred to the supervision of the Order of Augustinian Recollects. In 1776, the Recollects built the chapel of San Nicolas de Tolentino east of the Augustinian convent by the Para√±aque River. This stone chapel was used as a barracks for Spanish soldiers during the Philippine Revolution. From being the second biggest barrio in Para√±aque next only to San Dionisio in the early 20th century, La Huerta is now the second smallest barangay in the city at after several villages were created out of its old territory in the 1970s, including Don Bosco, Marcelo Green, Sun Valley and Merville. In 1985, the Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway was opened on a reclaimed area in the foreshore of La Huerta. The village also expanded with the creation of Freedom Island by the Philippine Reclamation Authority in the 1970s and 1980s as part of the South Reclamation Project under Boulevard 2000. Education St. Andrew's School in La Huerta La Huerta is home to the oldest school in Para√±aque, St. Andrew's School established in 1917. The following educational institutions are also located within the village: * La Huerta Elementary School * Para√±aque National High School (La Huerta Annex) * St. Paul College of Para√±aque Culture La Huerta is known for its colorful fiestas such as the biannual Sunduan festival where local bachelors in their barong Tagalog fetch their dates from their homes dressed in traje de mestiza and carrying a parasol, and parade them around town to the San Nicolas chapel at the town plaza. This festival is held in honor of the village's patron, Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, and dates back to 1876. The village also hosts the Caracol festival where men carry cascos or floats with effigies of saints held biannually in September since 1912. Transportation Elpidio Quirino Avenue, La Huerta's main street Being the old town proper of Para√±aque where the municipal hall once stood, several major thorougfares are routed through La Huerta. They include Elpidio Quirino Avenue (formerly Calle Real), the former main street that runs north-south across the old district in the area of the Para√±aque Cathedral, and Ninoy Aquino Avenue which gives access to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway travels along the western edge of the old center, and an extension of C-5 Road also runs along its eastern sector. The C-5 South Link Expressway will parallel the existing C-5 network and will also cut through the village's eastern sector once completed. The planned Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 extension to Cavite includes the construction of a station on Ninoy Aquino Avenue in La Huerta.

It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of Arrow. The episode was written by Judalina Neira and Kelly Wheeler, and is the directorial debut of Danielle Panabaker. Grant Gustin stars as Barry, and is joined by principal cast members Candice Patton, Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Hartley Sawyer, Danielle Nicolet, Jessica Parker Kennedy, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin. The episode focuses on the aftermath of Nora West-Allen's partnership with Eobard Thawne being exposed to Team Flash, and flashbacks showing how the two initially met. BD Wong voices the title character in a guest role. \\"Godspeed\\" originally aired on The CW on April 16, 2019, and was watched by a total of 1.31 million viewers. The episode received positive reviews from critics, although some criticized the treatment of the title character as a \\"one-off\\" villain.  Plot  In flashforwards to 2049, Nora West-Allen is a forensic scientist working with her best friend and colleague Lia. Together, they discover a mysterious speedster‚Äîwhom Lia dubs Godspeed‚Äîis stealing chemicals from laboratories. While Nora and Lia investigate a potential target, Godspeed hits Nora with lightning, exposing her speedster abilities. Initially believing Godspeed was responsible for her powers, Lia finds traces of a power dampening chip, revealing Nora was a speedster since birth and that it was implanted by her mother Iris West, which soon causes an argument between them. Later, Nora and Lia discover Godspeed's next target is Stagg Industries. Nora tries to fight Godspeed on even footing, but her inexperience with her powers allows Godspeed to steal what he wanted and kill Lia in the process. Upon further investigation, Nora learns Godspeed is August Heart, a former intern from Mercury Labs, and that he is stealing chemicals to create an everlasting version of Velocity 9, a drug that was previously used by speedsters Zoom and Trajectory to give them more speed. Nora realizes the only person who can help her is Eobard Thawne, who is incarcerated at Iron Heights. Thawne initially refuses to help Nora, but she eventually manages to convince him; allowing her to defeat Godspeed and avenge Lia. Nora celebrates her first victory with Thawne, who tells her to find the Time Vault to learn her father's true secret. At the vault, she discovers that her father Barry Allen was the Flash and Barry's final message to her before his assumed death. In the present, Team Flash has been reading Nora's journal. After realizing Lia was murdered, Iris releases Nora from the cell she was imprisoned in by Barry after her partnership with Thawne was exposed, allowing her to tell her side of the story and give her a second chance. Barry however, takes Nora back to 2049 without consulting his team and orders her to never return to the present. He then confronts Thawne, who is awaiting execution for his crimes.  Production  = Development = In July 2018, it was announced that Danielle Panabaker, who plays Caitlin Snow on The Flash, would be making her directorial debut with an episode of the fifth season.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The West-Allen family faces a shocking development in \\"Godspeed,\\" an episode that reaches new emotional heights under the thoughtful direction of cast member Danielle Panabaker.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode 7.6 out of 10. He reacted negatively to the onscreen treatment of Godspeed, saying that the episode underused its title character and turned him into a \\"throwaway, one- off villain\\", whereas he is much more three-dimensional in the comics. Despite this criticism, Schedeen enjoyed the main storyline involving Nora, as well as her interactions with Thawne, and felt the episode captured the essence of the show's first season, being \\"fun and simpl[e]\\". Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek too did not like the treatment of Godspeed as a \\"one-off\\" villain but said, \\"This was an excellent hour of The Flash, and one that I really hope is enough to shake the show completely out of the rather safe rut it has been in for much of the season.\\" He was particularly appreciative of the performances of Gustin as Barry, and Cavanagh as both Thawne and Sherloque.
