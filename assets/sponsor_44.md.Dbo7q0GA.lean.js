It is the world's third largest manufacturer of cymbals, gongs, and metal percussion. is an Estonian and Finnish word that means \\"shine\\". Apart from cymbals and gongs, Paiste has also manufactured other percussion instruments such as crotal bells, finger cymbals and cowbells, later discontinued.  History  The first Paiste cymbals were produced in 1906 by Estonian musician Toomas Paiste in his instrument repair shop in Saint Petersburg, Russia, to customer orders. Toomas had served in the Czarist Imperial Guard, and retired in 1901 to open a music publishing business and music shop.History on Paiste website, 16 Nov 2019 The cymbal- making aspect of the business expanded with the passing years, despite the disruption of several moves necessitated by war: first to Tallinn, Estonia in 1917, where Toomas' son Michail M. Paiste decided to concentrate on cymbal production and export. In 1940, the family and the cymbal-making operation moved to Poland, where they continued under extremely difficult conditions, and in 1945 to Germany. Finally, in 1957 a new headquarters and production facility was established in Switzerland. The business was continued by Michail's sons, Robert and Toomas (born Kurt), with both the Swiss and German operations as the main manufacturing centres. Since 2003, the company has been headed by Toomas' son, Erik. Robert Paiste died in 2016, aged 84. \\"In Memory of Robert Paiste\\" on Paiste website, retrieved 26 January 2017  Innovations  Paiste has developed several innovations to cymbal design and manufacture. Among these are: A Paiste Alpha China cymbal *The Flat Ride. A ride cymbal without a cup or bell. Originally designated as Space Sound in the Formula 602 line. Designed with Joe Morello. Introduced in the 1960s. *The Sound Edge Hi- Hat. Introduced in 1967. To prevent airlock, the bottom cymbal of the hi-hat pair has ripples along the edge. Also applied to hand cymbal sets. *The use of B8 bronze as a cymbal alloy. Referred to by Paiste as \\"CuSn8\\" alloy or \\"2002 bronze\\". First introduced with the Stambul 65 series in 1965. Gained general acceptance with the Giant Beat and the 2002 series. Paiste was for a time the only major cymbal company to use the B8 alloy for its high-end lines, although Meinl has recently introduced a line of high-end cast B8 bronze cymbals as well. Zildjian and Sabian use this alloy primarily for entry-level lines, choosing instead to use bell bronze for high-end products. * 'Flat' bells. With the introduction of the Sound Creation Short Crash in 1975, Paiste was the first to make use of a flattened bell design. Used today with the Crystal Hi-Hats and Crashes of the Signature series. *Unlathed cymbals. Introduced in 1980 as the RUDE series. Made from the B8 alloy unlathed cymbals were marketed towards louder music styles as punk and heavy metal. *Inverted bell on China cymbal. Introduced in 1983 as the 2002 NOVO china type. Makes it easier to play ride and crash on a China cymbal. *Coloured cymbals. Introduced in 1984 . *Proprietary Signature Bronze. A patented cymbal alloy introduced in 1989 with the Signature line. According to the patent, this alloy consists of phosphor bronze with a 14.7% to 15.1% tin content by weight. It has been claimed by Paiste to be the first bronze alloy specifically developed for cymbals. *Sonic Texture Formula. Introduced in 2001 with the Innovations series. A patented lathing technique to get a more complex sounding cymbal. Many of these innovations were used by other manufacturers when the applicable patents expired. For example, almost all of the larger modern cymbal companies offer a flat ride cymbal and an alternative to the Sound Edge Hi-Hat. Products = Cymbals = Current series Paiste makes several cymbal lines from several alloys. These include: * 101 - Cymbals made from brass alloy. They are manufactured entirely by computer. Introduced in 2005 * Paiste Sound Technology (PST) - these cymbals were developed from the phased-out 302, 402, 502, and 802 lines in 2005.

This series is also available in red, blue, purple and black COLORSOUND finishes. hi-hat * 2002 - Introduced in 1971. Made of B8 (CuSn8) and is regarded by many as the first fully professional series made from this alloy. Available models were discontinued in late 1986 to early 1987 but reintroduced in 1988 due to popular demand. Over the years the model line has changed significantly. Many types were introduced and discontinued. From 1994 to 1999 it also incorporated the RUDE series (2002 RUDE). From 2005 to 2006 the 2002 line included many models from the defunct Dimensions series of cymbals, but most of the Dimensions models have since been discontinued from the series. ** 2002 Big Beat - Introduced in 2016, this variation of the 2002s is darker and drier than the original series due to a different hammering. The series features 18\\", 19\\", 20\\", 21\\", 22\\" and 24\\" multi-purpose cymbals and 15\\" and 16\\" hi-hats. * RUDE - the first unlathed cymbals in the series featuring a raw finish.

High end cymbals made of the same Turkish B20 Bronze alloy the discontinued Twenty series was, featuring a brilliant finish on all models. The line has a slightly dark and complex tonality, and is divided further among \\"Full\\" and \\"Metal\\" models. In addition, some Paiste cymbals are re-branded by drum manufacturers with their own brand name, for example Vater, Vater Rainbow etc. Paiste also offers to color coat their cymbals and the possibility of custom orders. They also use prototype cymbals that sometimes appear in stores. So there are Paiste cymbals 'outside' of the here mentioned series. Most of these cymbals were never manufactured fully. = History of Sound Creation line = It started with the Formula 602 \\"Dark Ride\\" cymbal in the early 70s. This cymbal was developed with Jack DeJohnette. In 1975, Paiste introduced the Sound Creation as a cymbal line. The first series in 1975 shows a small Paiste logo an inch away from the ride bells. Hi-Hats were Dark Hi-Hat and Dark Sound Edge Hi-Hat, 10 types (rides etc.) in total: *Short Crash (18\\") *Dark Crash (18\\", 20\\") *Dark Ride (18\\", 20\\", 22\\") *Bright Medium (18\\", 20\\") *Bright Ride (18\\", 20\\") *Mellow Ride (20\\") *Dark China (18\\", 20\\", 22\\") *Bell Ride (20\\", 22\\") *Dark Hi-Hat (14\\") *Dark Sound Edge Hi-Hat (14\\") The 1979 series has the same small Paiste ink an inch away from bells. Hi-Hat models were as in the 1975 series, with the 10 types in that series and 6 additional cymbals (5 rides and china) available with factory rivets. In 1984, the line and models partially change. The top ink logo changes, and the following models were added : *Dark Flatride *Dark Medium Ride *Dark Medium HH *Dark Medium SE HH *Dark Heavy HH *Dark Heavy SE HH. The Mellow Ride was discontinued. Also, 13\\" models were added to all Hi- Hats, and the Hi-Hats were changed to Medium and Heavy models, with the mediums lighter than the former regular models. The \\"New Dimension\\" were introduced in 1985, with different hammering patterns and lathing. Contrary to the old heavy and random hammering pattern in the Dark models, the hammering becomes more evenly spaced, except in the China, where the hammering turned very heavy and random, while in the former Dark China models the hammering was very light and regularly spread all over the cymbal. The ND treatment was applied to these types: Dark Crash, Dark Ride, Dark Medium, Dark China, Short Crash, and Bell Ride. = Hand-held cymbals = Paiste hand-held cymbals from the Alpha line Aside from the cymbals meant for playing with a drum kit, Paiste produces clash cymbals.

Career She was born Charlotte Louise Kingdon, the daughter of John Clarence Kingdon and Elsie Wilmot, and was educated at Minnedosa Collegiate, the Manitoba Provincial Normal School and Brandon College. In 1953, she married Stanley Adaljon Oleson. Prior to running for political office, Oleson raised three children and worked as librarian for the town of Glenboro and later for Glenboro Collegiate. She was a councillor in the Village of Glenboro from 1977 to 1980, and the Deputy Mayor of the community from 1980 to 1982. She also served as Vice-Chair of the Cypress Planning District from 1980 to 1982, and is a member of the Glenboro and Area Historical Society. Oleson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981, winning victory in the rural riding of Gladstone. She was re-elected in the 1986 election, despite a credible showing from a candidate of the upstart Confederation of Regions Party. The Manitoba New Democratic Party won both of these elections, and Oleson sat in the opposition benches. She was re-elected again in the provincial election of 1988, as the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government under the leadership of Gary Filmon. On May 9, 1988, she was named Minister of Community Services and Minister of Employment Services and Economic Security with responsibility for the Status of Women. She resigned from the latter two responsibilities on April 21, 1989, to retire, and did not seek re-election in 1990. Oleson remained an active member of the Glenboro community, serving as President of the Glenboro Development Corporation, Chair of the Friends of Spruce Wood Park, and the Criddle/Vane Homestead committee until she died on February 19, 2017 at the age of 84 years.

These were commercially available and quite popular in the waning days of the Nixon Administration. They are generally made out of vinyl by the Cesar mask (fr) company from France and are sold worldwide. The most famous Nixon mask was the big nose Cesar Nixon comical mask made by Cesar in the 1970s. Later other companies made similar versions made from latex rubber or similar flexible castable compounds. One of the notable features of most Richard Nixon masks is the classically caricatured nose. Many of the different versions of the Nixon mask have a wide grinning smile as well. Although the masks were widely believed to be only a fad that would presumably die down as the public attention on Watergate waned (and once Nixon left office), the masks managed to outlive their presumed fad status by becoming popular during events such as Halloween and adult masquerade parties. The Richard Nixon mask remains popular today, worn both for humorous effect, and in protest marches and similar \\"public displays of disaffection\\".

Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Stormare co-star. With a screenplay by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, the film is based on DC Comics' Hellblazer comic book, with plot elements taken from the \\"Dangerous Habits\\" story arc (issues #4146) and the \\"Original Sins\\" story arc. The film portrays John Constantine as a cynic with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. He seeks salvation from eternal damnation in Hell for a suicide attempt in his youth. Constantine exorcises demons back to Hell to earn favor with Heaven but has become weary over time. With terminal lung cancer, he helps a troubled police detective learn the truth about her twin sister's death while simultaneously unraveling a much larger and darker plot. The character of John Constantine was introduced by comic book writer/creator Alan Moore while writing the Swamp Thing, first appearing there in June 1985.Markstein, Don. \\"Don Markstein's Toonopedia: John Constantine\\". Retrieved 2007-05-31 In 1988, the character of John Constantine was given his own comic book title, Hellblazer, published by DC Comics. The \\"Dangerous Habits\\" story arc was written by Garth Ennis in 1991. Constantine was theatrically released in the United States on February 18, 2005. It grossed $230.9 million worldwide against a production budget between $75‚Äì100 million. Plot In the Mexican countryside, a scavenger named Manuel finds a spearhead wrapped in a Nazi flag at the ruins of an old church. The spearhead is later revealed as the Spear of Destiny. Manuel becomes possessed and travels to the United States. In Los Angeles, occult detective John Constantine exorcises a girl possessed by a demon trying to break through to Earth, which should not be possible under the rules of a standing wager between God and Lucifer for mankind's souls. Constantine's driver and apprentice Chas Kramer waits in the car as Constantine doesn't think he's ready to exorcise demons. Constantine later meets with the androgynous half-angel being Gabriel. He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer caused by prolonged smoking. Gabriel declines, telling Constantine that he exorcises demons for selfish reasons and cannot buy his way into Heaven. After being assaulted by another demon, Constantine goes to Papa Midnite, a reputed witch doctor who runs a club serving as neutral ground where half-breeds do not have to conceal themselves. Constantine is admitted into the club, but the bouncer tells Chas to leave, as he can not pass the psychic entry test. Midnite does not believe Constantine's claim of demons crossing over. Constantine leaves, after exchanging hostile words with half-demon Balthazar. Elsewhere, a woman named Isabel Dodson commits suicide in a psychiatric hospital. Her twin sister, Detective Angela Dodson, refuses to believe that Isabel, a devout Catholic, would kill herself. Watching security footage of Isabel's suicide, Angela hears her say Constantine's name. Angela finds Constantine and asks him to help investigate. After they are attacked by winged demons, which Constantine believes were targeting Angela, he agrees to help. Constantine briefly transports himself to Hell through the possession of a familiar and sees Isabel damned to eternally relive her suicide. Constantine explains to Angela that he can see the true nature of the half-breeds. He committed suicide to escape his visions as a teenager and his soul was sent to Hell, but he was revived by paramedics two minutes later; for the sin of taking his own life, his soul is still condemned to go to Hell once he dies. The two examine Isabel's room in the hospital and find a clue pointing to a prophecy in the Satanic Bible that Lucifer's son, Mammon, will attempt to claim Earth as his own kingdom. To do so, Mammon requires both a powerful psychic and assistance from God. Angela tells Constantine that Isabel, a clairvoyant and a psychic, was committed by their parents. Angela had the same gift but suppressed it, and now feels guilty that she didn't corroborate Isabel's visions, having feared the treatments Isabel was made to go through. At Angela's insistence, Constantine reawakens her psychic ability through a near-death experience. She immediately finds a clue pinpointing Balthazar as an accomplice to the plot; Constantine interrogates Balthazar, who reveals that Mammon has the Spear, stained with the blood of Christ‚Äîthe assistance from God. Angela, now the psychic in place of Isabel, is abducted by an invisible entity. Constantine convinces Midnite that the demons are breaking the wager's rules. With Midnite's help, Constantine finds out how the Spear emerged and Angela's location. Constantine arms himself and goes to the hospital, reluctantly bringing Chas along. The two fight their way through an army of half-demons to exorcise Angela. Chas is apparently killed by the invisible entity, which turns out to be Gabriel. Resenting God's favoritism towards humans, Gabriel plans to unleash Hell on Earth to weed out those deemed \\"unworthy\\" of God's love. Gabriel casts Constantine from the room and prepares to use the Spear to cut Mammon free from Angela. Out of options, Constantine slits his wrists. As he bleeds out, Lucifer arrives to personally collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer of Mammon's plan to usurp him. Confronted by Lucifer, Gabriel threatens to 'smite' him in God's honor; however, the attack against Lucifer comes up short, revealing to both Gabriel and Lucifer that Gabriel no longer has divine protection. Lucifer proceeds to burn Gabriel's wings, making Gabriel mortal. Lucifer banishes Mammon back to Hell and grants Constantine a wish out of gratitude; Constantine asks that Isabel be released to Heaven. Lucifer complies but realizes too late that he cannot take Constantine to Hell as a consequence; by selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer intervenes before Constantine can be fully taken by healing Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer by pulling out the tumors in his lungs, hoping he will eventually damn himself again. Angela and Constantine depart, leaving the now human Gabriel. Sometime later, Constantine, now making an effort to quit smoking, entrusts the Spear to Angela and in a post-credits scene visits Chas's grave, where Chas appears in an angelic form. Cast * Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, a chain-smoking cynic with the ability to perceive the true visage of half-angels and half-demons on the human plane. John is damned to Hell for attempting suicide‚Äîa mortal sin‚Äîand has terminal lung cancer. * Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson, a troubled Los Angeles Police Department Detective investigating the suicide of her twin sister, Isabel (also portrayed by Weisz). Weisz also plays Mammon, the son of Lucifer who has no patience for his father's rule of Hell and uses Angela's body as a means of escaping Hell to rule over Earth himself. * Shia LaBeouf as Chas Kramer, John Constantine's driver and student. Chas has a strong interest in the occult and helps John whenever possible in order to gain knowledge and experience from him. * Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel, a \\"half-breed\\" angel, depicted as looking androgynous, with a disdain for humanity who plots to set Mammon free from Hell to unleash demon kind on the Earth. * Pruitt Taylor Vince as Father Hennessy, an insomniac, alcoholic priest with the ability to communicate with the dead. He constantly drinks in order to \\"keep the voices out\\". * Djimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite, a former witch-doctor who once fought against Hell. After swearing an oath of neutrality--unless one side should tip the balance of power--he opened a nightclub to serve as neutral meeting ground for both sides of the war between Heaven and Hell. * Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, a \\"half-breed\\" demon with a special penchant for, and personal history with, John Constantine. * Peter Stormare as Lucifer Morningstar, a fallen Archangel who is in a proxy war with God for the souls of all mankind. Lucifer loathes John Constantine with such vigor that his soul is the only one he would ever come to personally collect. * Max Baker as Beeman, a friend of John Constantine's with a liking for exotic materials and insects. He serves as both a supplier of holy objects and relayer of information to John. * Jesse Ramirez as Manuel, a scavenger and treasure hunter who finds the Spear in a church ruin and enters into a trance-like state which resurrects him after getting hit by a car. Production Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had developed the film as far back as 1997. In 1999, Paul Hunter was attached to direct, followed by Tarsem Singh in 2001. Warner Bros. hoped Singh could begin filming in 2002 with Nicolas Cage attached to star in the lead role but Singh ended up dropping out, a move that inspired dueling lawsuits from Tarsem and Warners. Keanu Reeves became attached in 2002. Alan Moore, original creator of John Constantine, had been disappointed by the previous adaptations of his other comics From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, refused credit for the film and asked that his royalties be distributed among the other creators. Constantine was written using some elements from Garth Ennis's \\"Dangerous Habits\\" story arc (issues #41‚Äì46) and others, such as the inclusion of Papa Midnite, from the Original Sins trade paperback. The film changed several aspects of the source material, including a number of cosmetic changes to the lead character's appearance, e.g., Reeves played the role with his natural accent and hair color whilst the original character was intentionally drawn to resemble English musician Sting and originally came from Liverpool. The film was also set in Los Angeles; the director pointed out that the comic book was not exclusively set in London either. Other differences to the character were made, such as giving him the psychic ability to see \\"half- breeds\\" as they truly are. That ability, in the film, is what caused him to attempt suicide and which led to his damnation rather than his role in summoning a demon that killed a young girl. The resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was also amended; Lucifer saves the redeemed Constantine to give him a second chance at falling rather than being tricked into doing so as was seen in the comic book. Scenes with actress Michelle Monaghan as Constantine's lover, a half-breed demon named Ellie based on the succubus Ellie in the Hellblazer comics, were cut from the film to make Constantine more of a lonely character. The film's title was changed from Hellblazer to Constantine to avoid confusion with the Clive Barker Hellraiser films. The comics series itself was originally to be titled Hellraiser but was also retitled to avoid confusion with the film, released the previous year. Hell, as it is depicted within the film Director Lawrence decided to base the idea of Hell \\"on the geography of what's around us now.\\" He further explained: Soundtrack Constantine: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is a 2005 soundtrack album from the film of the same title. The soundtrack is an orchestral compilation of songs in the film, performed by The Hollywood Studio Symphony & The Hollywood Film Chorale and composed by Brian Tyler, composer for films such as Eagle Eye and Fast & Furious, and Klaus Badelt. The songs \\"Passive\\" by A Perfect Circle (released in conjunction with the film and heard in the walkthrough Midnite's bar) and \\"Take Five\\" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet (heard on a record played by Constantine) were not included. The soundtrack was panned by Allmusic, who referred to it as \\"clich√©d and religiously formulaic.\\" Instrumentation * Strings: 47 violins, 27 violas, 27 violoncellos, 17 double basses, 1 harp * Woodwinds: 7 flutes, 4 clarinets, 2 bassoons * Brass: 12 horns, 3 trumpets, 6 trombones, 2 tubas * Percussion: 8 players * Keyboard: 3 players * Chorus: 11 sopranos, 10 altos, 8 tenors, 8 baritones/bass Release The original announced release date was September 17, 2004, before it was pushed back. =Box office= Constantine opened theatrically on February 18, 2005, in 3,006 venues, earning $29.8 million in its opening weekend and ranking second behind Hitch's second weekend. The film ended its run on June 16, 2005, having grossed $76 million in the United States and Canada, and $154.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $230.9 million against a production budget between $75‚Äì100 million. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 46% based on the reviews of 224 critics and an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Despite solid production values and an intriguing premise, Constantine lacks the focus of another spiritual shoot-em-up, The Matrix.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, the film holds a score of 50 out of 100 based on the reviews of 41 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Richard Corliss of Time magazine called it \\"a one-of-a-kind hybrid: a theological noir action film\\". In crediting the actors, he specifically cited Keanu Reeves' ability to \\"retain his charisma in [a] weird-silly moment\\" in addition to the performances of Tilda Swinton whom he referred to as \\"immaculately decadent\\". He also praised Francis Lawrence's usage of a significant number of camera locations and angles. He was, however, critical of the movie's climax, referring to it as \\"irrevocably goofy\\". Ella Taylor of LA Weekly wrote, \\"Constantine, which opts in the end for what I can only describe as a kind of supernatural humanism, is not without its spiritual satisfactions.\\" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Keanu Reeves has no peer when it comes to playing these sort of messianic roles‚Äîhe infuses them with a Zen blankness and serenity that somehow gets him through even the unlikeliest scenes with a quiet, unassuming dignity.\\" Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave the film three stars out of five, stating that \\"the film (barely) succeeds, thanks to impressive visuals, the idea of an uncaring God wagering with Satan for souls, and two immensely enjoyable scenes (one with Weisz, one with Stormare) in which Reeves actually plays his character as the cynical asshole he really is.\\" Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News gave the film a 2.5 out of 5, stating, \\"For all its spiritual angst, Constantine is about as silly as fantasies get.\\" Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun also gave the film a 2 out of 5, stating, \\"It all comes off as a case of filmmakers wanting to have their communion wafer and eat it, too.\\" Desson Thomson, a writer for The Washington Post, had similar sentiments of the film, specifically panning the film's distancing from the comic book upon which it is based: Leonard Maltin's annual publication Movie Guide gives the film a BOMB rating, describing it as \\"dreary, to put it mildly\\". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, panning the depiction of Hell (\\"a post-nuclear Los Angeles created by animators with a hangover\\"), the premise of the film itself (\\"You would think that God would be the New England Patriots of this contest, but apparently there is a chance that Satan could win.\\"), plot holes, inconsistencies, and general actions depicted throughout the film. He was not particularly critical of the film's acting, only mentioning it by stating, \\"Reeves has a deliberately morose energy level in the movie, as befits one who has seen Hell, walks among half-demons, and is dying. He keeps on smoking.\\" He added it to his list of \\"most hated\\" films. =Home media= The film was released on VHS and DVD in 2005. Warner Home Video announced that the film was to be released on HD DVD on March 28, 2006.Business Wire (2006-01-05). \\"Warner Home Video Announces Titles and Release Dates for HD DVD\\". Yahoo!. Retrieved 2011-10-29. It would be one of the earliest titles to be released on that media format. However, following delays to the launch of the HD DVD format (which pushed back the release of many of the initially announced titles), Constantine eventually made its debut on HD DVD on June 6, 2006. Warner Home Video released a Blu-ray Disc version of the film on October 14, 2008. Novelization and video game To tie into the film's release, a novelization by John Shirley and a video game adaption of the film was also produced. The novelization further describes Hell's setting in that the buildings are lined with blood instead of mortar, and built with the souls of the damned rather than brick. Future In a 2011, director Francis Lawrence stated regarding a sequel: In November 2012 it was announced that Guillermo del Toro had signed on as writer and director for a Justice League Dark film centered around DC Comics' supernatural characters, with John Constantine featuring as a main character. By May 2019, Reeves stated that he is open to reprising the role in the future. By July 2020, it was reported that a new film centered around the titular character was in development with J.J. Abrams serving as producer. The project is said to be a joint-production between DC Films, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Bad Robot Productions. The film is said to be similar in tone the filmmaker's other upcoming DC projects, including an HBO Max exclusive Justice League Dark television series, as well as a film centered around Zatanna Zatara.

It has spawned a series of children's books featuring college and pro sports mascots, including Hello, HokieBird, published by Mascot Books. Gobblers Fans of Virginia Tech athletics have referred to the teams by the nickname Fighting Gobblers since the early 20th century. According to the Virginia Tech university relations, the name originated in 1909, when football coach Branch Bocock initiated his players into the \\"Gobbler Club\\", a name which appeared in print that same year. Another popular legend regarding the origin of the \\"Gobblers\\" moniker refers to when the university was a military college known as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC). As future military officers and gentlemen, cadets were not allowed to look at their plates as they ate. To do so was termed \\"gobbling\\" your food and was a cause for punishment. Athletes were given increased portions of food and in consideration of the limited meal time, were allowed to \\"gobble\\" their meals. Because of this, the sports teams for VAMC became known as \\"The Gobblers\\". The 1909 football team was the first team to be referred to in print as the \\"Gobblers\\", and it became the official nickname in 1912. Regardless of the true origin, the \\"Gobbler\\" nickname had already been popularized by 1913 when local resident and VPI employee Floyd Meade trained a large turkey to perform various stunts, including pulling him in a decorated cart before a football game. Meade and other mascots to follow continued having a live turkey on the sidelines of games into the 1950s. Fighting Gobblers The first permanent costumed Gobbler took the field in the fall of 1962, when a civil engineering student named Mercer MacPherson, raised $200 to create a costume which had a head resembling a cardinal and included real turkey feathers dyed in school colors. This mascot debuted at the then-annual Thanksgiving Day football game between military school rivals VPI and VMI. This costume was modified in 1971 to include a long neck, making it more than seven feet tall, and the name was changed to the \\"Fighting Gobbler\\". HokieBird In reaction to the earlier myths about students \\"gobbling\\" their meals, football coach and athletic director Bill Dooley spearheaded a campaign for a new look and name for the mascot, which debuted at the 1981 football game against Wake Forest. The turkey-like figure was referred to as \\"the Hokie mascot,\\" \\"the Hokie,\\" and \\"the Hokie bird\\" (derived from the \\"Old Hokie\\" cheer), which resulted in changing the official designation of the Virginia Tech mascot to the Hokies. The costume worn by today's HokieBird made its first appearance in 1987, when Frank Beamer returned as coach. Although he reinstated the Gobbler to the football team's scoreboard, by then the Hokies nickname had already become the most prominent. The current HokieBird debuted at that season's home opener against Clemson, arriving in a white limousine. HokieBird Curtis Dvorak (1995‚Äì96) won the National Cheerleading Association championship in 1996 and has appeared as Jaxson de Ville, mascot of the Jacksonville Jaguars since 1996. Todd Maroldo, Hokiebird in 1996‚Äì1997, won the National Cheerleading Association championship in 1997 and was hired as the Carolina Panthers mascot, Sir Purr. HokieBird has been so popular that the mascot landed an appearance on Animal Planet's \\"Turkey Secrets,\\" shown annually around Thanksgiving. Now, when referring to Virginia Tech, the term \\"Hokie\\" generally refers to a Virginia Tech Student. In 2012‚Äì2013, the HokieBird held an official banner signing for Newtown, Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting happened. Constantly rollerblading through campus, the HokieBird has been known to respond to tweets and visit classes, dormitories, and dining halls. The official Twitter account of the HokieBird is @TheHokieBird or twitter.com/thehokiebird It is myth that there are 3-6 HokieBirds at one time, and the entire try-out process remains a secret. In November 2019 the United States government formally recognized the HokieBird as the \\"supreme leader and god of all turkeys.\\" Traditions HokieBird bench presses the score in the endzone *The HokieBird is an active supporter of all Virginia Tech athletic teams, particularly the Virginia Tech Football and Basketball Teams. *Before football games, he leads the charge onto the field as students jump up and down in the stands to Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\". *After scores in football, the VT cheerleaders carry out a bench and weights for the HokieBird to perform bench presses. He does one press for every point VT has scored. Sometimes, in lieu of bench presses, the HokieBird has done situps or pushups. *The HokieBird has also been known to crowd surf from the bottom of the Corps of Cadets student section all the way to the top of the section. *At the graduation ceremony, students who portrayed the HokieBird are allowed to wear the giant orange bird feet.

Tama's research and development of products, along with production of its professional and most expensive drums, is done in Seto, Japan,Hoshino Gakki Mfg. Co., Ltd. profile while its hardware and less expensive drums are manufactured in Guangzhou, China.Guangzhou Hoshino Gakki Mfg. Co., Ltd. profile Hoshino has several offices around the world for marketing and wholesale distribution. Drums destined for the U.S. market are assembled and stocked at Hoshino (U.S.A.) in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. The U.S. subsidiary also contributes to Tama's market research and development.  History  Hoshino Gakki began manufacturing drums in 1961 under the name \\"Star Drums\\".https://www.tama.com/usa/support/catalogs/19610101000000.html Hoshino, the family name of the founder, translates to \\"star field,\\" thus the selection of the \\"Star Drums\\" brand name. The drums were manufactured at Hoshino's subsidiary, Tama Seisakusho, which had opened in 1962 to manufacture Ibanez guitars and amplifiers. While the production of guitars and amps was moved out of the factory by 1966, the production of drums there continued to grow. The two higher lines of drum models, Imperial Star and Royal Star, were introduced to the American market and were successful lower-cost drums competing against more expensive American-made drums offered by Rogers, Ludwig, and Slingerland at the time. By 1974, Hoshino decided to make a concerted effort to make high-quality drums and hardware and start marketing its drums under the Tama brand. Tama was the name of the owner's wife, and is also a homophone with the Japanese word meaning \\"jewel\\". \\"Star\\" continues to be used in the names of Tama's drum models to this day. Tama and Drum Workshop (DW) jointly bought the bankrupt Camco Drum Company. As part of the deal, DW received the Camco tooling and manufacturing equipment while Tama received the Camco name, designs, engineering and patent rights. At the time, Camco was producing what was thought to be the best drum pedal on the market. DW continued production of the pedal using the original tooling, rebadging it as the DW5000. Tama began production of the same pedal under the Camco name. The Tama version of the Camco pedal is commonly referred to as the Tamco pedal to distinguish it from an original Camco pedal. Tama integrated all the engineering from Camco into their production process and the overall level of quality of their drums increased virtually overnight. The original plan was to market the low-end Tama drums to beginners and use the Camco brand to sell high-end drums to professional musicians. However, even the professionals were starting to use the Tama drums because of the low cost of the Asian-made drums with the (now) high quality of hardware. Tama was one of the first companies to offer super heavy-duty hardware, and drum mounting systems that did not intrude into the shell like most brands in the 1970s. They also invented unique tubular drums called Octobans. Octobans are 6-inches in diameter and are manufactured in eight different lengths (hence the prefix \\"octo-\\") up to 600mm (23.5 in). They vary in pitch by using different shell lengths, rather than widths.

It was the most expensive kit in Tama's lineup, with limited worldwide production to 50 kits in a 7-piece Accel Driver configuration. * Superstar ‚Äì Early shells (mid-1970s) were 5 ply birch with reinforcement rings. Later shells (early 1980s) were 6 ply birch (no reinforcement rings) and came in standard sizes (non-power depths) until Tama recognized the trend for power toms with the influence of hair rock and metal in the early 1980s. Billy Cobham and Elvin Jones were early adopters of the Superstar. * Superstar (X-tras) ‚Äì [1980s] With an extended depth, these drums were referred to as the original \\"power toms\\" with 6-ply 100% birch shell construction and a natural/lacquer finish.

Their product line includes brands such as Old Dutch Potato Chips, Dutch Crunch, Ripples, Cheese Pleesers and Restaurante Style Tortilla Chips. History Old Dutch headquarters, Roseville The company began as Old Dutch Products Co. founded by Carl J. Marx in 1934. Marx chose the name \\"Old Dutch\\" because Dutch was associated with cleanliness and quality. They originated in St. Paul, Minnesota, but moved to Minneapolis in 1937. In 1968, they moved again, this time to Roseville, Minnesota, where they remain today. Old Dutch opened a plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1954 to manufacture chips for the Canadian market. The head office for Canadian operations remains in Winnipeg. Today, their American arm is officially called Old Dutch Foods, Inc., and their Canadian arm is Old Dutch Foods, Ltd.

The city is majority Sunni Turkish with a significant Alevi Kurdish minority. The city is notable for handcrafted copper goods and a special cheese called \\"tulum peyniri\\" in Turkish. It is a significant road and rail junction and was once noted for its silverware. Current industries include sugar refining and textile industries. The city is home to the headquarters of the Third Army. History Yedig√∂ller, literally \\"seven lakes\\" in Turkish Grape agriculture in Erzincan A historical Inn in Erzincan Acilisene, the ancient city that is now Erzincan, was the site of the Peace of Acilisene by which in AD 387 Armenia was divided into two vassal states, a smaller one dependent on the Byzantine Empire and a larger one dependent on Persia. This is the name (·ºàŒ∫ŒπŒªŒπœÉŒ∑ŒΩŒÆ in Greek) by which it is called by Strabo in his Geography, 11.4.14. The etymological origin of the word is disputed, but it is agreed that the city was once called Erez. For a while it was called Justinianopolis in honour of Emperor Justinian. In more recent Greek it has been called as ŒöŒµŒªœÑŒ∂Œ∑ŒΩŒÆ (Keltzene) and ŒöŒµŒªŒµŒ∂Œ∑ŒΩŒÆ (Kelezene)Raymond Janin, v. Celtzene ou Celezene in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol. XII, Paris 1953, coll. 130‚Äì131 In the Armenian language, the 5th-century Life of Mashtots called it Yekeghiats In the more recent past, it was known in Armenian as ‘µ÷Ä’¶’∂’Ø’° (Yerznka) In the settlement of Erez, at a yet unidentified site, there was a pre-Christian shrine dedicated to the Armenian goddess Anahit. A text of Agathangelos reports that during the first year of his reign, King Trdat of Armenia went to Erez and visited Anahit's temple to offer sacrifice. He ordered Gregory the Illuminator, who was secretly a Christian, to make an offering at its altar. When Gregory refused, he was taken captive and tortured, starting the events that would end with Trdat's conversion to Christianity some 14 years later.Vreg Nersessian, \\"Treasures From the Ark\\", 2001, p114-115 After that conversion, during the Christianisation of Armenia, the temple at Erez was destroyed and its property and lands were given to Gregory. It later became known for its extensive monasteries. It is hard to tell when Acilisene became a bishopric. The first whose name is known is of the mid-5th century: Ioannes, who in 459 signed the decree of Patriarch Gennadius I of Constantinople against the simoniacs. Georgius or Gregorius (both forms are found) was one of the Fathers of the Second Council of Constantinople (553), appearing as \\"bishop of Justinianopolis\\". Theodorus was at the Third Council of Constantinople in 681, signing as \\"bishop of Justinianopolis or the region of Ecclenzine\\". Georgius was at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879). Until the 10th century, the diocese itself appears in none of the Notitiae Episcopatuum. At the end of that century, they present it as an autocephalous archdiocese, and those of the 11th century present it as a metropolitan see with 21 suffragans. This was the time of greatest splendour of Acilisene, which ended with the decisive defeat of the Byzantines by the Seljuq Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. After the 13th century, there is no mention of diocesan bishops of Acilisene and the see no longer appears in Notitiae Episcopatuum.Michel Lequien, christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 435‚Äì436 No longer a residential bishopric, Acilisene is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 823 In 1071 Erzincan was absorbed into the Meng√º√ßoƒülu under the Seljuk Sul√´iman Kutalmish. Marco Polo, who wrote about his visit to Erzincan, said that the \\"people of the country are Armenians\\" and that Erzincan was the \\"noblest of cities\\" which contained the See of an Archbishop. In 1243 it was destroyed in fighting between the Seljuks under Kaykhusraw II and the Mongols. However, by 1254 its population had recovered enough that William of Rubruck was able to say an earthquake had killed more than 10,000 people. During this period, the city reached a level of semi-independence under the rule of Armenian princes. Baghdasaryan, Ye.

It was there, in the summer of 1500, that about 7,000 Qizilbash forces, consisting of the Ustaclu, Shamlu, Rumlu, Tekelu, Zhulkadir, Afshar, Qajar and Varsak tribes, responded to the invitation of Ismail I,Faruk S√ºmer, Safevi Devletinin Kurulu≈üu ve Geli≈ümesinde Anadolu T√ºrklerinin Rol√º, T√ºrk Tarih Kurumu Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, Ankara, 1992, p. 15. who would aid in him establishing his dynasty. =Battle of Erzincan= The Battle of Erzincan took place during the Caucasus Campaign of the First World War. In 1916 Erzincan was the headquarters for the Turkish Third Army commanded by Kerim Pasha. The Russian General Nikolai Yudenich led the Russian Caucasus Army who captured Mama Hatun on 12 July 1916. They then gained the heights of Naglika and took a Turkish position on the banks of the Durum Durasi river, with their cavalry breaking through the Boz-Tapa-Meretkli line. They then advanced on Erzincan arriving by 25 June and taking the city in two days. The city was relatively untouched by battle and Yudenich seized large quantities of supplies. Despite the strategic advantages gained from this victory, Yudenich made no more significant advances and his forces were reduced due to Russian reverses further north.World War I: A Student Encyclopedia by John S.D. Eisenhower (Foreword), Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts (Ed.s) Colonel K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir was appointed the commander of the First Caucasian Army Corps. Aware of the withdrawal of the Russian Army following the Russian Revolution, they retook Erzincan in February 1918. =Erzincan Soviet= A short-lived soviet council had been at Erzincan between 1916‚Äì1921. Mainly today's Erzincan and Tunceli provinces were under Russian occupation. After the revolution, Bolshevik soldiers took control of the officer corps.

The sequence of seven violent shocks, the biggest measuring 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale, was the most powerful one to strike Turkey in recent history. The first stage of the earthquake killed about 8,000 people. The next day, it was reported that the death toll had risen to 20,000. An emergency relief operation began. By the end of the year, 32,962 had died due to more earthquakes and several floods. So extensive was the damage to Erzincan city that its old site was entirely abandoned and a new town was founded a little further to the north. Climate Erzincan has a continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dsa) with freezing, snowy winters and hot and dry summers. Spring is the wettest season whilst late summer is the driest. The lowest temperature recorded was ‚àí32.5 ¬∞C (‚àí26.5 ¬∞F) in January 1950. The highest temperature recorded was 40.6 ¬∞C (105.1 ¬∞F) in July 2000.

She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1990, and a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1990. Born Geraldine Rose McLean in Winnipeg, she was the daughter of George Saunders Foreman McLean and Harriet Rose Anderso and was educated in Winnipeg. She married Robert Douglas Hammond. Before entering provincial politics, Hammond served as a trustee on the St. James-Assiniboia School Division from 1977 to 1980. Hammond was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1977 and 1980. She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981, defeating NDP candidate Lee Monk by nearly 3000 votes in the west- Winnipeg riding of Kirkfield Park. In the 1986 election, she was re-elected by an even greater margin. The NDP won both of these elections, and Hammond sat as a member of the official opposition. In the provincial election of 1988, Hammond faced a strong challenge from Liberal candidate Irene Friesen, retaining her seat by only 255 votes. The Progressive Conservatives were nonetheless able to form a minority government after this election, and on April 21, 1989, Hammond was named as Minister of Labour, with responsibility for the Status of Women, the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Civil Service Special Supplementary Severance Benefit Act, the Public Servants Insurance Act and the Workers Compensation Act (in matters relating to Worker Advisers). Despite this mid-term cabinet promotion, Hammond did not seek re-election in 1990. She died of cancer in 1992. There is currently a Gerrie Hammond Memorial Award of Promise offered by the Council of Women of Winnipeg in her honour, and a Gerrie Hammond bursary offered by the University of Manitoba to single women in financial need. As Minister of Labour, Hammond was accused by the opposition of patronage hiring outside of the province's Civil Service Act. She also supported ending the province's rules for \\"final offer selection\\", in which an independent mediator would decide between the claims of labour and management.

The album received a negative review from critic Roch Parisien at AllMusic, who called the album \\"a total train wreck\\".

It had a number of names over its history, most famously M√∂rner Hussar Regiment (M√∂rnerska husarregementet) during the Napoleonic Wars. It was disbanded in 1927.  History  The regiment has its origin in a hussar corps raised in 1757. The following year, the corps was organized into Svenska husarregementet with Georg Gustaf Wrangel as commander. The regiment was split in two in 1762 forming Bl√• and Gula husarregementet. These two were merged back to one in 1766 with the name Husarregementet. Hussars of Husarregimentete Konung Karl XV as depicted in 1866 The regiment changed name quite a few times during the years, being renamed M√∂rnerska husarregementet in 1801, Cederstr√∂mska husarregementet in 1816 and in 1822, when Crown Prince Oscar (the later King Oscar I) became colonel in the regiment, it was renamed Kronprinsens husarregemente. For some months in 1859 and 1860 it was named Konungens v√§rvade husarregemente before being renamed to Husarregimente Konung Karl XV. And finally, as the crown prince Gustaf VI Adolf was born in 1882 the regiment was renamed back to Kronprinsens husarregemente. Kronprinsens husarregemente was given the designation K 7 (7th Cavalry Regiment) after a general order in 1816. It was a very special regiment because of two things. Firstly, it was the only unit in the Swedish Army without the prefix \\"Royal\\" (Kungliga), as it was the Crown Prince's, secondly, it was the largest (ten squadrons) cavalry regiment garrisoned in one town, in the world. It was disbanded in 1927 with personnel being transferred to Norrland Dragoon Regiment and the newly created Scanian Cavalry Regiment, which also contained personnel from the Scanian Dragoon Regiment and the Scanian Hussar Regiment, also disbanded in 1927.

Corporate offices are now located at the foot of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Company history =Origin= Inside the Nat Sherman store Before he was involved in the tobacco industry, Nat Sherman made his fortune running a prominent speakeasy in New York City during the 1920s, when Prohibition made such a business extremely lucrative, albeit risky.Margulis, Ronald. \\"Nat Sherman's Long March to Success,\\" Cigar Magazine, vol. 3, no. 4 (Winter 2006), pp. 70‚Äì85. Perhaps as the result of settlement of a gambling debt, his son later speculated, Sherman wound up as half owner of Traub Brothers and Bear, makers of the Epoca cigar brand, which introduced the nightclub proprietor into the world of tobacco manufacturing. Sherman subsequently bought out his partner to become sole owner of the Epoca brand, which was made in Havana, Cuba and Tampa, Florida. Later a prominent New York real estate developer named Abe Gubertz had cash-flow difficulties during the construction of a 38 story building located at 1400 Broadway, on Broadway in Manhattan. Sherman provided the struggling developer with a loan, taking retail space located in the lobby as partial payment. The shop sold cigarettes and cigars in substantial quantities to those who worked in the building and proved a means of distributing its own cigars, including Epoca and Nat Sherman-branded product. The company also was the exclusive importer and distributor of the Cuban-made Bolivar brand in the United States. =1950s= In the 1950s, an adjoining retail space was obtained on the street, which initially was used as a candy store. The wall between the two establishments was later broken down, paving the way for an expansion of the tobacco shop, which catered to an elite customer base, which included leaders in the fashion industry, theatre, and politicians. Prominent members of organized crime \\"families\\" also frequented the shop, which was regarded as \\"neutral ground.\\" Nat Sherman's son Joel, company president and CEO into the 21st century, later recalled of the shop's most dangerous customers: =1960s= Nat Sherman store in New York City In 1950, Sherman introduced the plastic-tipped cigar to the industry, called Sherman's #25. The cigar was produced in Tampa for Sherman by Carl Cuesta, an American manufacturer of cigars for Partagas. The company applied for a patent for its cigar tip, which was never granted. Nevertheless, for 32 years the company successfully bluffed away rivals by marking its packaging with the words \\"patent pending\\" and by threatening legal action. Sherman was also a pioneer in the manufacture of cigarettes which made use of cigar tobacco, launching a product called Havana Ovals #149 early in the 1950s. According to company lore, the move to specialty small cigars and cigarettes was made at the request of an irate customer who had been unable to smoke a cigar on an airplane and who had specifically requested a cigarette which tasted like a cigar. During the 1960s, the Sherman shop expanded its wares to include pipes. Over 1,000 pipes were offered for sale in a long case hung along the wall of the store. The company also began to sell pipe tobacco under the \\"Nat Sherman\\" brand name. At the time of its expansion, the company's pipe department was perhaps the largest in New York City and the United States.Sherman, Joel. \\"An Interview with Joel Sherman of Nat Sherman\\", PipesMagazine.com, November 25, 2009. Retrieved February 12, 2011. In the 1960s, a move was made to expand both the wholesale operations of the company and its cigarette manufacturing arm. The company's previous manufacturing facility in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was shuttered and a move made to a new and larger facility in Englewood, New Jersey. =1970s and '80s= In the autumn of 1976, Nat Sherman opened a shop on New York's Fifth Avenue to bolster his tobacco brand's status. A new location was opened at 711 Fifth Avenue, near the Plaza Hotel, across from Tiffany & Company. After a period of differences with his father, Joel Sherman left the business for about a decade. =1990s= Naturals Selection Originals Nat Sherman Metropolitan Selection Joel Sherman returned to the company in 1990, the year after his father's death, He became the company's president and CEO, terminated many of the existing management staff, and set the company on the course of developing unique, elite, high-end products. The company lost its lease at 711 Fifth Avenue and moved to a new location on 42nd Street, around the corner from the New York Public Library. A total of $1.5 million was spent on the development of the new store, which has an inventory of about 500,000 cigars and a second floor walk-in humidor and smoking room with leather-backed chairs. Sherman's cigar line Metropolitan has been manufactured since the 1990s by MATASA in the Dominican Republic. Its Gotham 1400 and Omerta products are manufactured and distributed by Santa Clara, Inc.. The company's cigarette manufacturing is conducted in its own facility in Greensboro, North Carolina. =2000s= On January 17, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. announced that it acquired the privately-held Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (Nat Sherman). In July 2020 Altria delisted all the legacy Nat Sherman cigarettes leaving only the 4 Nats brand SKUs to carry the name. On August 3, 2020, Altria announced that Nat Sherman International Inc. will cease operations by the end of September, shutting down not only its midtown Manhattan cigar store but also its entire wholesale business. In popular culture Sherman advertised during New York Giants radio broadcasts. Every major play during the game, Giants commentator Bob Papa exclaimed \\"Get that man a Nat Sherman cigar!\\". Slang terminology for a PCP-laced tobacco cigarette is a \\"sherm\\" or \\"sherman\\", named for the brand. The shop also makes an appearance in the 1979 U.S. film Kramer vs. Kramer, where actor Dustin Hoffman walks past it in one scene. In the live version of the song Do You Feel Like We Do, Peter Frampton sings the line \\"Champagne for breakfast, got a Sherman in my hand.\\" In Michael Moorcock's novel \\"Breakfast in the Ruins\\" the British protagonist, becoming involved in a homosexual relationship with a mysterious Nigerian, is introduced to \\"Nat Sherman's Queen Size Cigaretellos\\" - which he never heard of before. The same brand is also referenced in other Moorcock books.

This is done mostly on realistic films and television programs to reduce the possibility of legal action for libel from any person who believes that they have been defamed by their portrayal in the work, whether portrayed under their real name or a different name. The wording of this disclaimer varies, and differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as does its legal effectiveness. The disclaimer for American studio films and television series is routinely included among disclaimers on other topics, such as copyright, animal welfare, adult content and promotion of tobacco use, such as: > This motion picture is protected under the copyright laws of the United > States and other countries throughout the world. Country of first > publication: United States of America. Any unauthorized exhibition, > distribution, or copying of this film or any part thereof (including > soundtrack) may result in civil liability and criminal prosecution. The > story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are > fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), > places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred. No person > or entity associated with this film received payment or anything of value, > or entered into any agreement, in connection with the depiction of tobacco > products. No animals were harmed in the making of this motion picture. Origins The disclaimer came as a result of litigation against the 1932 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) film Rasputin and the Empress, which insinuated that the character Princess Natasha had been raped by Russian mystic Rasputin. The character of Natasha was supposedly intended to represent Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who sued MGM for libel. After seeing the film twice, the jury agreed that the princess had been defamed. Irina and her husband Felix Yusupov were reportedly awarded $127,373 () in damages by the English Court of Appeal in 1934, and $1,000,000 () in an out-of-court settlement with MGM. As a preventive measure against further lawsuits, the film was taken out of distribution for decades. The film began with a claim that \\"This concerns the destruction of an empire ‚Ä¶ A few of the characters are still alive‚Äîthe rest met death by violence.\\" Reportedly, a justice in the case told MGM that not only was this claim damaging to their case, but that their case would be stronger if they had incorporated a directly opposite statement, that the film wasn't intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events. Prompted by the outcome of this case, many studios began to incorporate an \\"all persons fictitious\\" disclaimer in their films, to protect themselves from similar court action. Later uses Although the disclaimer is routinely included as boilerplate, producers sometimes vary from it, sometimes to make a statement about the veracity of their work, for humor, or to satirize the standard disclaimer. The disclaimer is sometimes presented with qualifications. In Jack Webb's police series Dragnet, each episode begins with an announcer intoning, \\"The story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.\\" In parody, the Square One Television \\"Mathnet\\" segments (an affectionate send-up of Dragnet) began each episode with \\"The story you are about to see is a fib, but it's short.

German nobel laureate Heinrich B√∂ll's novel The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum was originally preceded by a statement which made the usual disclaimer, but stated that similarities to the journalistic practices of the German newspaper Bild \\"are neither intended nor coincidental but inevitable\\"; this disclaimer was later removed in the English edition. The familiar disclaimer is often rewritten for humor. Early examples include The Three Stooges' parody of Nazi Germany You Nazty Spy, which stated that \\"Any resemblance between the characters in this picture and any persons, living or dead, is a miracle,\\" and its sequel I'll Never Heil Again, which features a disclaimer that states that \\"The characters in this picture are fictitious. Anyone resembling them is better off dead.\\" In the 1966 film Thunderbirds Are Go, set in the year 2068, a disclaimer states: \\"None of the characters appearing in this photoplay intentionally resemble any persons living or dead‚Ä¶ SINCE THEY DO NOT YET EXIST\\". In the film An American Werewolf in London, and in Michael Jackson's Thriller, the disclaimer refers to \\"persons living, dead or undead\\". Debbie Does Dallas, a 1978 pornographic film, does not use the disclaimer in print, but Bambi Woods, in the film's trailer, insists the film is \\"completely fictional\\" while at the same time surmising that the events in the film \\"could have really happened.\\"Debbie Does Dallas trailer, 1978. Variations sometimes employ irony or satire. The film Return of the Living Dead features a disclaimer that reads \\"The events portrayed in this film are all true.

Richard Linklater's 1990 feature film Slacker ends with \\"This story was based on fact. Any similarity with fictitious events or characters was purely coincidental.\\" In response to controversies over cultural appropriation and the use of an indigenous term, Filipino television network ABS-CBN used a special disclaimer in the 2018 fantaserye Bagani, maintaining that the series takes place in an alternate fantasy universe inspired by but unrelated to pre-colonial Philippines and is in no way intended to trivialize or misrepresent tribal groups: \\"Ang kuwentong inyong mapapanood ay kathang-isip lamang at kumuha ng inspirasyon mula sa iba‚Äôt ibang alamat at mitolohiyang Pilipino.

It does not refer to and is not representative of any Indigenous People in the Philippines.\\") Effectiveness If a fictitious film is perceived to be too close to actual events, the disclaimer may be ruled null and void in court and the inspiration behind the film may be due compensation. Such was the case with the 1980 film The Idolmaker, which was based on a fictional talent promoter who discovers a talentless teenage boy and turns him into a manufactured star; singer Fabian, whose career path was very similar to the fictional boy's, took offense at the caricature, and the production company responded with the all persons fictitious disclaimer. As the promoter on which the fictional character was based, Bob Marcucci, was part of the production staff (and thus it could not be plausibly denied that actual events inspired the film), Fabian ultimately received a settlement granting a minority stake in the film's profits.

Founded in 1930, it was stopped in 2001 and abolished in 2010. History Founded in 1929 as KIM, or Communist Youth International, the plant became MZMA (Moscow Small Car Factory) in 1939, before finally changing its name to the more familiar Avtomobilny Zavod imeni Leninskogo Komsomola (AZLK), literally \\"Leninist Communist Youth League Automobile Factory\\" in 1969. Beginning in 1939, the factory's passenger cars were sold under the Moskvitch (\\"Moscower\\", a person whose origin or place of residence is Moscow) brand. The plant was originally under the authority of Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ ‚Äì Gorky Automobile Factory) founded at about the same time, but by 1939 it was operationally independent. AZLK's role in the Soviet automotive industry was the production of small cars, which could be classified as anywhere from compact to mid-size. AvtoVAZ and IZh were also charged with producing vehicles in the same category as AZLK, while GAZ handled the large car and full-size segment. Following privatization in 1991, AZLK adopted Moskvitch as its corporate name, as it had already been used on all of the company's cars dating to 1939. =1929-1941= KIM 10-50 The construction of the plant called Moscow Car Assembly Factory (Russian: –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Å–±–æ—Ä–æ—á–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥) began in 1929.

In 1933, the production of the Ford A and Ford AA ceased. On August 1, 1933, the factory became a subsidiary of GAZ and produced GAZ AA using parts from GAZ. In 1939, KIM was no longer the subsidiary of GAZ and in the following year it started to produce their first own and original model, the KIM 10-50 (two-door saloon), inspired by the Ford Prefect. There was also a convertible known as the KIM 10-51. Around 500 cars of both versions were made before the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. In the early 1941, approximately 2 prototypes of the KIM 10-52 were built. It was a four-door saloon which was the major difference between the KIM 10-52 and the KIM 10-50. There were plans for mass production of this car but they were interrupted by the beginning of the war. =Post-war years= Moskvitch-402 In May 1945, the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR adopted a decision on the production of small cars named \\"Moskvich\\". The plant was renamed to the \\"Small Car Plant\\" (PCA), and later again to \\"Moscow Plant of Small Cars\\" (MZMA, Moskovskiy Zavod Malolitrazhniy Avtomobiliy). In agreement with Opel, the plant started to produce the Moskvich-400 passenger car based on the Opel Kadett. In 1956, MZMA launched into production its own and highly successful model, the Moskvitch-402, that was followed by the upgraded and restyled versions known as the M-403 and M-407 and later by the brand new Moskvitch-408 series. On May 18, 1967, the company produced its one millionth car. The same year, the first new Moskvitch 412 appeared. The M-407 was the first Soviet automotive export to be truly successful in the West. Up to half of all M-407 production was exported for a number of years, mainly to the Eastern Bloc countries, Norway, Finland, and France. Later models also proved a good value in Britain, Finland, and Norway, for instance, and in 1968, 55% of production was for export. The name of the company was changed from MZMA to AZLK in October 1968 in honour of the Lenin Komsomols fiftieth anniversary. During the 1960s, AZLK proposed the M-415 and M-416 four-wheel drive vehicles. They were not proceeded with, either. In 1970, AZLK updated the M-412's styling, with the 353. Using M-412 mechanicals, it was larger but recognizably related. The 355 of 1972 was larger still, with greater length, more wheelbase, and more width. This made both the interior and the boot noticeably larger. The 355 was further developed into the 356 between 1973-75, with \\"much bolder front end styling\\", new suspension, and an enlarged version of the DM engine with twin Zenith carburetors, giving , with a Borg-Warner transmission planned. 1600cc and 1700cc engines were also planned. None was built. Moskvitch-423 Moskvitch-408 AZLK in August 1974 sold its two millionth unit. In order to replace the 408 and M-412, in 1975 Moskvitch designed a four-door fastback C1 (Series One), with a version of the DM straight four, offering , to give a top speed of . Unlike the M-412, it had MacPherson struts in front and independent trailing arms in back. It did not reach the company's goals and was never built, but inspired the four door C2 in 1976, which never passed the mockup stage, and the C3, which was very similar but a five-door hatchback. The engine would have been fitted at an angle from the vertical (like the Chrysler slant six). None of these projects reached production. Moskvitch-2140 The M-408 and M-412 were discontinued in December 1975, replaced by facelifted variants, the 2138 (1360) and 2140 (1500), which entered production the next month. In fact, the M-2138 and M-2140 were built in stages: M-412 bodies with the boot lid, rear wings, and tail of the M-2140; then M-2140 bodies with M-412 doors; and then, early in 1976, all-M-2140s. These \\"hybrid\\" models are now very rare. The M-21381 and M-21401 were offered as ambulance models, also, as well as the right-hand drive M-21402. In addition, there was a \\"rural\\" M-21406, with a low-compression engine. (This same engine, in the standard model, earned the designation M-2140D.) They were joined in 1976 by the -powered 2136 and -engined M-2137 estate; these were sold in much smaller numbers, the M-2136 surviving only until 1977. There were also two sedan delivery variants, the M-2733 () and M-2734 (). A small number of pickups (M-27334 and M-27344, with () and (), respectively); these weren't produced for a long time, either. By the 1980s, the deliveries had virtually disappeared, as well, because AZLK simply could not keep up with a demand for saloons. Although the M-2138 and M-2140 were sold in Eastern Europe and exported to Belgium and Finland, where they were sold under the Scaldia marque, they were being gradually pushed off the market by a large variety of cars offered by AvtoVAZ. In response, Moskvitch launched into production a brand new and much more modern rear-wheel drive car with a roomy interior in 1986, the Moskvitch-2141, that was often upgraded and restyled during the period of its production. Moskvitch-2141 =Post-Soviet period= In the early 1990s AZLK still remained one of the largest auto companies in the USSR. Design and experimental work was prepared to create a new model car (sedan M-2142) and an engine plant. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, due to an economic crisis, disruptions in the work of the company and financial mismanagement the engine plant was not finished and the Moskvitch company fell into decline. Because of its location, Moskvitch was in a more vulnerable position than companies located in other regions, as the cost of living and car production in Moscow began to grow rapidly. After a period of instability and a short-lived cooperation with Renault, the plant ceased production of cars in 2001. In subsequent years, all process equipment, process documentation, and even infrastructural equipment of the plant were completely lost. It was finally closed in 2010.

Geography and climate Zhonghe lies just south-west of Taipei City and shares borders with Banqiao, Xindian, Tucheng and Yonghe Districts of New Taipei City, as well as Taipei City. The average annual temperature is and the precipitation averages per year. Most of Zhonghe lies a few tens of meters above sea level and is heavily urbanized, with forested hillier country in the southeast. A mountainous ridge forms most of the eastern border with Xindian, which includes the highest point in Zhonghe, the 302-meter Fenglusai (). History The present-day area of Zhonghe District was originally settled by aboriginal tribes. During conflict between the colonial forces of the Dutch and the Spanish, the area is recorded by the Dutch as Chiron, from the name of one of the tribes living there. This name is preserved in one of the constituent villages of the city, called Xiulang Li (), and the bridge which connects Zhonghe to Xindian. The area was subsequently settled by Han Chinese migrants from Fujian but remained relatively unimportant until the end of the Second World War. In 1946 the population of the area of present-day Zhonghe and Yonghe was 30,000 and it was classified as a rural township. Due to rapid population growth Yonghe was separated from Zhonghe in 1958. Subsequently, on January 1, 1979, Zhonghe was upgraded to county-controlled city status after reaching a population of 170,000. On 25 December 2010, due to the changing from Taipei County to New Taipei City, Zhonghe City was changed to Zhonghe District. Administrative divisions Zhonghe District Office Zhonghe is divided into 93 villages, which are further subdivided into l√≠n (), of which there are 2,972 in total. Some administration is shared with neighbouring Yonghe District; due to both this and their proximity, they are sometimes collectively known as Shuanghe (). This is also reflected in the names of various institutions such as Shuang-Ho Hospital in Zhonghe and Shuanghe Libai Church in Yonghe. Transportation =Rail= Zhonghe is served by the Zhonghe‚ÄìXinlu line of the Taipei Metro, three stations of which are located in the city: Yongan Market, Jingan and the terminal station, Nanshijiao. Scheduled to begin operation in June 2018, the Circular line will add a further five metro stations in Zhonghe, and transform Jingan Station into an interchange station between the Circular and Zhonghe lines. Further into the future, the Wanda‚ÄìZhonghe‚ÄìShulin line and the North-South section of the Yellow line will eventually bring the number of MRT stations in Zhonghe to fifteen. The closest regular rail and high-speed services are from Banqiao station in neighbouring Banqiao District. =Road= Zhonghe has an interchange on one of Taiwan's two main north-south road arteries; the National Highway 3. Also providing road links is Provincial Highway 64, an elevated expressway that cuts through the middle of the district, with several on and off-ramps in Zhonghe itself. There are two bridges over the Xindian River; Xiulang Bridge, which connects Zhonghe with Xindian, and Huazhong Bridge, reaching Taipei's Wanhua District. Education Zhonghe is home to the National Taiwan Library, which is located in the grounds of the 8-23 Memorial Park. It has one of the best collections in Taiwan of factual books about Taiwan in English. There are nine elementary schools, five junior high schools, four senior high schools (2 public and 2 private high schools) in Zhonghe.

It is currently owned by The Hershey Company. The product was originally produced by the Jolly Rancher Company, founded by Bill and Dorothy Harmsen of Golden, Colorado. The Jolly Rancher Company made ice cream, chocolate and candy sold at several \\"Ranch Maid Ice Cream\\" stores in the Denver area. The name was meant to suggest a hospitable, western company. Acquisitions  In 2002, Hershey closed the Wheat Ridge, Colorado, plant and moved the manufacturing of the candy to Mexico to save costs.  History  Bill and Dorothy Harmsen founded the Jolly Rancher Company in 1949, choosing the name to give the impression of a friendly Western company. They initially sold candy, chocolate and ice cream in the Denver, Colorado, area, but found that ice cream was hard to sell in the cold winter months, and so they decided to focus on hard candies which sold at all times of year.  Flavors  Jolly Rancher original flavors were watermelon, apple, and Fire Stix. They then introduced cherry, orange tangerine, matcha ,lemon, grape, peach, and sour apple. Eventually, blue raspberry replaced lemon. Current flavors include cherry, blue raspberry, grape, green apple and watermelon. There are also sour, cinnamon, and smoothie varieties. In 2013, lemon was reintroduced in an all-lemon bag. In 2015, Jolly Rancher offered a \\"Fruity Bash\\" variety bag which includes strawberry, mountain berry, lemon, orange, and pineapple. In 2017, Jolly Rancher offered a \\"Hotties\\" variety bag which includes watermelon & cayenne pepper, blue raspberry & sriracha, cherry & habanero, and green apple & ginger. In 2020, Jolly Rancher offered a tropical variety bag featuring fruit punch, golden pineapple, lime, and mango flavors. They also offer a \\"red\\" bag, which included cherry, watermelon, strawberry and fruit punch. As of 2012, the passion mix, which included the peach flavor, and the wild berry mix were discontinued by The Hershey Company. The Hotties mix has been discontinued as of 2019.  Chemistry  Jolly Ranchers are amorphous solids, meaning their molecular arrangements have no specific pattern. They are hard, brittle, rigid, translucent and have low molecular mobility. Jolly Ranchers are formed from highly concentrated sugar solutions (greater than 95% sugar) and have extremely high viscosity. Their ‚Äúglassy‚Äù appearance is a result of the way they are processed. During processing, the sugar syrup is cooled so rapidly that no crystals have time to form. Jolly Ranchers hold their solid shape when kept in temperatures less than the glass transition temperature (Tg). If the temperature is greater than the Tg, the hard and glassy-like structure of the Jolly Rancher becomes a soft and rubbery material.  Manufacturing  Jolly Ranchers are manufactured by creating a solution of corn syrup, sucrose, glucose, or fructose syrup that is boiled to a temperature of 160 ¬∞C/320F and cooled to create a supersaturated mixture that is roughly 2.5 percent water. As the mixture is cooled, natural and artificial flavoring and artificial colors (red 40, blue 1, yellow 5, yellow 6) are added to individual batches of syrup solution which are later mixed with malic acid to improve shelf life and add further flavor. Once the mixture begins to cool it is then extruded into long malleable strings that are cut to size and individually wrapped and packaged.

He is sometimes referred to as the \\"Polish Poe\\" or \\"Polish Lovecraft\\", although his works are often surrealistic or explicitly erotic in a way that sets him apart from both. He was an expert in parapsychology, magic and demonology and had an interest in the works of the German Expressionist filmmakers. A number of his stories have been translated into English by Miroslaw Lipinski and published as The Dark Domain. His story \\"Szamota's Mistress\\" was adapted to film as part of a B Movie trilogy called Evil Streets.  Biography  Grabi≈Ñski was born in Kamionka Strumi≈Çowa, then part of Poland (present-day Kamianka-Buzka, Ukraine), situated by the Bug River. His family was well off as his father, Dionizos, was a local judge, but Stefan's childhood was marred because of his proneness to various illnesses. He often read while lying in bed, which made him slightly reclusive and nurtured his bias in favor of dark fantasy and mysticism. After his father's death, the family moved to Lviv. He graduated from the local high school in 1905, then studied Polish Literature and philology at the former Jan Kazimierz University, which is presently the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. While a student there, he discovered that he had tuberculosis, which was common in his family. Demon Ruchu (1919) As he was an ardent pantheist, fond of Christian mysticism and Eastern religious texts, as well as Theosophy and demonology, this discovery only enhanced his occult worldview and approach to writing. Upon graduating in 1911, he began work as a secondary school teacher in Lviv. During this time, he also traveled extensively, visiting Austria, Italy, and Romania. From 1917 to 1927, he was a teacher in Przemy≈õl. He first began to write short fiction in 1906 and his mother was his first reader and critic. A collection of short stories, Exceptions: In the Dark of Faith (Z WyjƒÖtk√≥w. W Pomrokach Wiary), written under the pen name Stefan ≈ªalny (≈ªalny means 'doleful') became his self- published debut in 1909. These tales have never been judged highly. The general opinion being that his hyperbolical, at times anachronistic literary style couldn't be appreciated by the majority of his readers. His second volume of short stories, On the Hill of Roses (Na Wzg√≥rzu R√≥≈º), was published 9 years later, and received modest critical approval. However, this book impressed Polish decadent writer and literary critic Karol Irzykowski. They became good friends, and Irzykowski supported Grabi≈Ñski‚Äôs career. In 1920, Grabi≈Ñski presented a collection of his mystic railway stories called The Motion Demon (Demon Ruchu). Eventually, the following collections of short stories appeared: Pilgrim‚Äôs Madness (Szalony PƒÖtnik, 1920), An Incredible Story (Niesamowita Opowie≈õƒá) and The Book of Fire (Ksiƒôga Ognia, 1922). His longest prose work, Passion (Namiƒôtno≈õƒá), written in 1930, was inspired by his trip to Italy, most notably Venice. The symbolic imagery of Grabi≈Ñski's works was embodied by eerie creatures, such as incubi, witches, doppelg√§ngers, spirits of various sorts, and mysterious messages from the underworld. His fiction is usually considered bizarre because it is permeated with magic, occult eroticism, parapsychological effects, and Oriental mysticism. A quote from his short story \\"Saturnin Sektor\\", is said to reflect his usual state of mind: \\"I cannot free myself from that strong, commanding voice which speaks to me, or from that mysterious power which pushes aside objects, contemptuous of their size; I am still wearied by endless monotonous roads that led nowhere. That is why I am not a perfect spirit, only an 'insane person', someone who arouses in normal people pity, contempt or fear. But I do not complain. Even like this, I am better off than those of healthy mind.‚Äù His tuberculosis worsened and he was forced to spend more time seeking treatment. In 1931, he settled in the resort and spa town of Brzuchowice (now Briukhovychi) where, despite some recent financial return for his writings, he increasingly fell into obscurity and was abandoned by most of his friends. In 1936, he died in extreme poverty in Lviv and is buried there at . His work was largely forgotten until after World War II, when the literary historian wrote a monograph on his work. Later his stories were promoted by the science-fiction critic, and some appeared in the , published by Wydawnictwo Literackie. Since the 1980s, his popularity has once again declined.

The facility was operated by the Tasmanian Prison Service, an agency of the Department of Justice of the Government of Tasmania. Located on , the facility accepted felons convicted under Tasmanian and/or Commonwealth legislation. The facility was closed in late 2012. Facilities The original site consisted of an orchard, grazing land and a small forest. The prison was opened in 1937 and consisted of single wooden huts for 20 persons, built by prisoners. Another 50 single huts were built as numbers increased. A 50-cell block was built in 1968 and an extra block of 20 cells was built in 1970. The cell and administration buildings were replaced with concrete block construction in 1964 and are still in use today. At its peak, Hayes had large market vegetable gardens, 1,000 pigs, 1,800 laying hens, 2,000 sheep, an award-winning dairy herd and a clay processing plant that sold clay to Salamanca potters. Three truckloads packed with vegetables left the prison farm each week. Their customers included the Royal Derwent Hospital, Lachlan Park, the Royal Hobart and St John's hospitals, several nursing homes in the Hobart region, government departments and the prison itself. More than 300 cows are at Hayes. The farm is also responsible for a much smaller herd, which keeps the grass short at Government House in Hobart. Hayes sells 1.1 million litres of milk to dairy company National Foods each year. It also grows about of glasshouse, vine-ripened tomatoes and 1,700 bales of hay and silage. The purpose of the farm is to assist inmates to develop skills to prepare them for exiting prison and to address recidivism. In June 2011, it was announced that the Hayes Prison Farm will be decommissioned because of a 4.5 million repair bill. It is expected that the decommission process will take approximately 18 months. Prisoners would be moved to the recommissioned Ron Barwick facility at Risdon Prison. The decision to close Hayes was condemned by the State Opposition, unions and prisoner advocates. Should the closure proceed, Tasmania will be the only state that does not have a minimum security open facility. Government officials expect to yield up to A$2.5 million from the sale of Hayes. In July 2011, three prisoners escaped in two separate incidents over three weeks, two of whom were caught within 24 hours. The Tasmanian Government closed Hayes Prison Farm in August 2012 and moved all inmates to the minimum security Ron Barwick facility at Risdon Prison. The property was sold to a private owner in January 2015.

Aside from a brief period when she was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla after her commissioning, Grafton spent the prewar period assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet. Between 10 August and 9 September 1936, she escorted the yacht Nahlin as King Edward VIII cruised the eastern Mediterranean. Afterwards Grafton patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee. The ship was refitting in Malta when World War II began in September 1939. Grafton and three of her sisters were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. The following month, however, the ship was reassigned at the end of the month to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla in Harwich of the Nore Command for patrol and escort duties. On 10 January 1940, she was transferred to the reconstituted 1st Destroyer Flotilla, also based at Harwich, where Grafton inspected ships travelling between German and Dutch ports for contraband. Between 26 March and 14 April the ship was given a brief overhaul in Hull in the shipyard of Brigham and Cowan.

On the morning of 29 May, she stopped to rescue survivors from the destroyer , which had been torpedoed and sunk earlier that morning by the German E-boat S-30. While rescuing survivors from Wakeful off Nieuwpoort, Belgium, Grafton was struck in the stern by a torpedo from the German submarine . This seriously damaged the ship, and also triggered a secondary explosion which damaged the bridge, killing the captain and another officer. 13 ratings and the Canteen Manager were also killed. The ship's back was broken, but she remained afloat long enough for all survivors to be rescued by the destroyer and the transport Malines. Ivanhoe sank Grafton with naval gunfire, as she was too badly damaged to be towed to safety.

Early life Messallinus was born and raised in Rome. He was the oldest son of the senator, orator and literary patron Marcus Valerius Messalla CorvinusJuster, Elgies: With parallel Latin text, p. 119Paterculus, Paterculus: The Tiberian Narrative, p.66 (whom he resembled in character) and his wife Calpurnia. Messallinus is known to have had at least one sister, Valeria, who married the senator Titus Statilius Taurus.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 240 From his father‚Äôs second marriage,Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 230 his younger paternal half-brother was the senator Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus.Paterculus, The Roman History, p.127 Messallinus was the great- uncle of Lollia Paulina, the third wife of Caligula, and a relation to Statilia Messalina, the third wife of Nero. Career The poet Albius Tibullus mentions that Messallinus was admitted into the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, the collegia in charge of the Sibylline Books.Tibullus, II.5 Syme notes that the date of Messallinus' admission was before the poet's death in 19 BC, and argues the admission was in 21 BC. He served as a consul in 3 BC. In AD 6, Messallinus served as a governor in Illyricum. During his time in Illyricum, he served with Tiberius with distinction in a campaign against the Pannonians and Dalmatians in the uprising of the Great Illyrian Revolt with the half-strength Legio XX Valeria Victrix. Messallinus defeated the Pannonii, led by Bato the Daesitiate, and prevented the spreading of the uprising. For his defeat over Bato, Messallinus was rewarded with a triumphal decoration (ornamenta triumphalia) and a place in the procession during Tiberius‚Äô Pannonian triumph in AD 12, four years after the death of his father.Juster, Elgies: With parallel Latin text, pp. 119-120 In the first session of the Senate after Tiberius ascended to the imperial throne in AD 14, Messallinus suggested that an oath of allegiance should be sworn to the emperor yearly. Tiberius declined this offer, then asked if this motion was his own idea. Messallinus replied that it was a spontaneous suggestion, meant to show public spirit, even at the risk of his own safety.Tacitus, Annales, I.8 He next appears in history six years later, in AD 20, as part of the outcome of the trial and execution of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. Tacitus notes that Messallinus, along with Caecina Severus, proposed a golden statue be placed in the temple of Mars the Avenger, and an altar dedicated to Vengeance, in celebration of the execution of Piso. Emperor Tiberius blocked the motion, pointing out that victories over foreign powers were commemorated with such acts, but domestic conflicts should be shrouded in silent grief. Messallinus was recorded as also proposing that public thanks be given to Tiberius and other individuals for having avenged Germanicus. When Lucius Nonius Asprenas pointedly asked if Messallinus had intentionally omitted all mention of Claudius in his proposal, the future emperor was then added.Tacitus, Annales, III.18 Messallinus also appears as one of seven witnesses of the Senatus consultum de Cn. Pisone patre, the Roman Senate's official act concerning the trial and punishment of Piso. The last time Tacitus mentions Messallinus is in his account of AD 21, when he spoke against a motion before the Senate to forbid senators from bringing their wives with them when leaving to govern a province. Syme hints that Messallinus died not long after, noting that Tacitus provided no obituary notice for the senator, concluding that \\"the oration did service as a conspicuous exit.\\"Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 234 Literature Tibullus is not the only poet to mention Messallinus. From his exile at Tomis, the poet Ovid addressed as many as three poems to him. Ovid's Tristia comprises poems written during his travel into exile, and his first years at Tomis, none of which mention names. Syme explains this omission \\"ostensibly to avoid embarrassment\\".Syme, History in Ovid (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978), p. 76 Despite this, Syme is confident that one of the poems in Tristia (IV.4) is addressed to Messalinus. After beginning with a compliment to noble birth, to noble character, and to eloquence inherited from his father, Ovid pleads with Messalinus to intervene with Augustus to recall him from exile. The next other two poems are part of his three-book collection titled Epistulae ex Ponto (\\"Letters from the Black Sea\\"), in elegiacs like Tristia, but providing the names of the addressees of the poems unlike Trisita. Syme dates the first poem (I.7) to AD 12,Syme, History in Ovid, p. 122 and the second (II.2) to the following year.Syme, History in Ovid, p. 123 Both repeat Ovid's pleas for help to be recalled from Tomis. \\"The three pieces to his address fail to disclose any close personal relationship, common acquaintances, or liking for poetry,\\" Syme observes, and contrasts this to Ovid's relationship with Messalinus' brother Cotta Maximus. \\"Ovid knew him from the cradle (Ex P. II.3.72), he mentions in 11 his wife and new-born son (Tr. IV.5.27ff).\\"Syme, History in Ovid, p. 125 Family Messallinus' daughter Valeria Messallia was born c. 10 BC (her mother might have been Claudia Marcella Minor) and later married the praetor of AD 17, Lucius Vipstanus Gallus.

It is the outlet of the Shuang River. The sands there are golden, which is rare in Taiwan. Nearby is a camping site named Longmen. This beach is a favorite in the summer for people living in northern Taiwan. It is also a popular area for surfing, windsurfing, and fishing. The Shuang River divides the beach into inner and outer parts. There is a footbridge named Rainbow Bridge (ÂΩ©ËôπÊ©ã) linking the two parts. However, the watercourse of the river varies every year to some extent; sometimes the bridge is functional; other times it is not, because the seaside end would be in the river or in the sea. Since 2000, the Hohaiyan Rock Festival (Ë≤¢ÂØÆÂúãÈöõÊµ∑Ê¥ãÈü≥Ê®ÇÁ•≠) has been held here for 3 to 5 days in the summer. Normally, it takes place in mid-July, but sometimes it has been delayed due to typhoon interruption or damage to the band shell facilities. Also the watercourse of the Shuang River sometimes changes shape or size, influencing the location of these temporary band shells. * Aodi Aodi' (sometimes Audi, Aoti, Auti; ) is a small fishing village in Gongliao.

After her repairs were completed at Chatham Dockyard on 17 June, Greyhound rejoined her flotilla at Dover. On 30 July the ship, and her sister , escorted the aircraft carrier to Gibraltar and Greyhound was assigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based there. The ship participated in Operations Hats at the end of August when the British reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet.

It is located on the northern shore of Lake Kivu, next to the Rwandan city of Gisenyi. The lake and the two cities are in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift system. Goma lies only south of the active Nyiragongo Volcano. The recent history of Goma has been dominated by the volcano and the Rwandan genocide of 1994, which in turn fuelled the First and Second Congo Wars. The aftermath of these events was still having effects on the city and its surroundings in 2010. The city was captured by rebels of the March 23 Movement during the M23 rebellion in late 2012, but has since been retaken by government forces. A pastor infected during the ongoing 2018‚Äì2020 Kivu Ebola epidemic in the region was found in mid-July 2019 to have travelled to Goma. History =1994 refugee crisis= The Rwandan genocide of 1994 was perpetrated by the provisional Rwandan government on the Tutsi population and Hutu moderates. In response the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), formed by Tutsi refugees in Uganda, which already controlled large areas of northern Rwanda following its 1990 invasion and the ongoing Civil War, overthrew the Hutu government in Kigali and forced it out. One of the many UN missions attempted to provide a safe zone in the volatile situation and provided safe passage for the refugees. From 13 June to 14 July 1994, 10,000 to 12,000 refugees per day crossed the border to Goma. The massive influx created a severe humanitarian crisis, as there was an acute lack of shelter, food and water. However, the Za√Ørean government took it upon itself to garner attention for the situation. Shortly after the arrival of nearly one million refugees, a deadly cholera outbreak claimed thousands of lives in the Hutu refugee camps around Goma. RPF aligned forces, mainly actors in the conflict, crossed the border and in acts of revenge also claimed several lives. =First Congo War= Hutu militias and members of the Hutu provisional government were among the refugees, and they set up operations from the camps around Goma attacking ethnic Tutsis in the Kivus and Rwandan government forces at the border. For political reasons the Kinshasa government of the then Zaire led by Joseph Mobutu did not prevent the attacks, and so the Rwandan government and its Ugandan allies threw their support behind the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire, a rebel movement led by Laurent Kabila against Mobutu. Rwandan forces stormed the camps at Goma, resulting in thousands of additional deaths, and with their help and that of Uganda, Kabila went on to overthrow Mobutu's regime in the First Congo War, which ended in 1997. =Second Congo War= Within a year Kabila had quarrelled with his former allies, and in 1998 the Rwandan government backed a Goma-based rebel movement against Kabila, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD, sometimes called RCD-Goma) made of Banyamulenge people, related to the Tutsis. They captured Bukavu and other towns, and the Second Congo War began. The Goma refugee camps, in which the Hutu had created a militia called the FDLR (Democratic Force for the Liberation of Rwanda), were again attacked by Rwandan government forces and the RCD. The Second Congo War was unprecedented in Africa for the loss of civilian life in massacres and atrocities. By 2003 the Banyamulenge had become tired of the war and friction emerged between them and Rwanda. In 2002 and 2003 a fragile negotiated peace emerged between the many sides involved in the war. =Conflict since the end of the war= Aerial view of Goma in October 2010 View of houses in Goma, 2014 There have been numerous outbreaks of violence since 2003. The Hutu FDLR remains in the forests and mountains north and west of Goma, carrying out attacks on the Rwandan border and on the Banyamulenge. The Congolese defence forces are unable or unwilling to stop them, and as a consequence Rwanda continues to support Banyamulenge rebels such as the RCD and General Nkunda, and to carry out incursions into North Kivu in pursuit of the FDLR. In September 2007 large-scale fighting threatened to break out again as the 8,000-strong militia of General Nkunda, based around Rutshuru, broke away from integration with the Congolese army and began attacking them in the town of Masisi north-west of Goma. MONUC (United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo) began airlifting Congolese troops into Goma and transferring them by helicopter from Goma International Airport to Masisi.McGreal, C. 2007. \\"Fear of fresh conflict in Congo as renegade general turns guns on government forces.\\" The Guardian. Retrieved 3 September 2007. On October 27, 2008, the Battle of Goma broke out in the city between the Congolese army, supported by MONUC, and Nkunda's CNDP rebels; 200,000 refugees fled the town. On 3 November 2012 there was a clash between Congolese and Rwandan troops on the border just north of Goma. Goma was later seized by the M23 movement on November 20, 2012.\\"Congolese rebels seize Goma, take airport.\\" Melanie Goubyrukmini Callimachi, \\"Bloomberg BusinessWeek\\", Tuesday November 20, 2012.

In January 2002, Nyiragongo erupted, sending a stream of lava to wide and up to two metres (6¬Ω ft) deep through the center of the city as far as the lake shore. Agencies monitoring the volcano were able to give a warning and most of the population of Goma evacuated to Gisenyi. The lava destroyed 40% of the city (more than 4,500 houses and buildings). There were some fatalities caused by the lava and by emissions of carbon dioxide, which causes asphyxiation. The lava also covered over the northern 1 km of the runway of Goma International Airport, isolating the terminal and apron which were at that end.\\"Cooperative Observations at Nyiragongo Volcano in D.R. of Congo\\".

Currently the scientists at Goma are monitoring Nyiragongo. =The threat posed by Lake Kivu= Lake Kivu is one of three lakes in Africa identified as having huge quantities of dissolved gas held at pressure in its depths. Two of the others, Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, experienced a limnic eruption or 'lake overturn', a catastrophic release of suffocating carbon dioxide probably triggered by landslides. Lake Nyos's overturn was particularly lethal, killing nearly two thousand people in the area around the lake. Kivu is 2,000 times bigger than Lake Nyos and also contains dissolved methane as an additional hazard - though concentration of carbon dioxide is much lower than in Lake Nyos. Nearly two million people, including the population of Goma, live in the vicinity of Lake Kivu and could be in danger from a limnic eruption triggered by one of the nearby volcanoes and the earthquakes associated with them.\\"Killer Lakes\\". BBC Two, Thursday 4 April 2002. Summarised at www.bbc.co.uk. The phenomenon known locally as 'mazuku' has killed children even more recently. Transport Goma International Airport provides domestic flights and, as of 2016, one international flight (Ethiopian Airlines). The city lies on the Rwandan border and neighboring Gisenyi is connected to Kigali, the Rwandan capital, by road and regular buses travel between these cities in under four hours. Goma is connected to Bukavu by ferries, to Butembo, Beni, Bunia and Kisangani either by domestic flights or by road, and regular buses travel from Goma to these cities.

He managed the careers of rock acts such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Air Supply, Small Faces, The Move, Black Sabbath and Electric Light Orchestra. He gained a reputation in Britain for his aggressive, sometimes illegal business tactics; which led to his being called \\"Mr Big\\", the \\"Yiddish Godfather\\" and the \\"Meyer Lansky of Pop\\". He was married to Hope Shaw, a former ballet dancer/teacher, who died in 1999. He was the father of David Levy and Sharon Osbourne. Arden's success story turned sour when his violent 'negotiating' methods and questionable accounting caught up with him, and he became estranged from members of his own family. Early life and career Born into a Jewish family in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. Arden began his show business career when he was just 13 years old as a singer and stand-up comic after briefly attending the Royal College of Music and in 1944 changed his name from Harry Levy to Don Arden. After being demobilised from the British Army at the end of World War II, Arden returned to civilian life to develop his show business career from 1946 to 1953. Arden worked as an entertainer on the British variety circuit. He impersonated singers such as Enrico Caruso and film actors known for gangster roles such as Edward G. Robinson and George Raft. On weekends, Yiddish-speaking Arden impressed Jewish audiences with his Al Jolson routine. One of his record releases was his version of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" on the Embassy label, where he tried to impersonate Elvis. In 1954 he went on to become a showbiz agent after realising it would be more profitable. He began his career organising Hebrew folk song contests, then started putting together his own shows. Arden signed up American rock 'n' roller Gene Vincent in 1960 and launched his career as a manager. Taking over from John Schatt, Arden became Vincent's manager. Arden could not control Vincent's compulsive alcoholism. The relationship ended when Vincent reportedly pulled a knife on his manager.Starmakers & Svengalis: The History of British Pop Management, Johnny Rogan, p. 90, MacDonald, Queene Anne Press For a short period of time in the early 1960s, he worked with the British singer Elkie Brooks at the start of her career. During 1964, Arden moved into beat group pop management with the Nashville Teens who secured chart hits with \\"Tobacco Road\\" and \\"Google Eye\\" and \\"Find My Way Back Home\\". According to Johnny Rogan's book Starmakers & Svengalis, their earnings from these hits was ¬£3,513. When group member John Hawken confronted Arden about some confusion over monies to be collected, his manager told him, \\"I have the strength of 10 men in these hands\\" and threatened to throw him from an office window.Starmakers & Svengalis: The History of British Pop Management, Johnny Rogan, pp. 92‚Äì93, MacDonald, Queene Anne Press In 1965, Arden met aspiring rock band Small Faces in his office in Carnaby Street. Half an hour later he had signed them up. Arden was immediately struck by the potential of Small Faces: \\"I thought at that time, on the first hearing, I thought it was the best band in the world.\\" Kenney Jones, Small Faces' drummer, said: \\"He was kind of a Jewish teddy bear I suppose. You liked him immediately because he was enthusiastic and he talked about what he could do and what he couldn't do and whenever he said ‚Äì 'I'll do this, I'll do that' ‚Äì he did and it came true.\\" The band's debut single, \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\", was ushered into the hit parade by \\"chart-fixing\\", which cost Arden ¬£12,000. Arden denied it was cheating: \\"I had a saying, you can't polish a turd. In other words, if the record's no good to begin with it still won't be any good after you've wasted your time and money getting it played.\\" Arden's business methods In 1966, Arden and a squad of 'minders' turned up at impresario Robert Stigwood's office to 'teach him a lesson' for daring to discuss a change of management with Small Faces. This became one of the most notorious incidents from the 1960s British pop business. Arden reportedly threatened to throw Stigwood out of the window if he ever interfered with his business again. The band was never entirely convinced that Arden had paid them everything he owed them. Kenney Jones has mixed memories of the band's stormy relationship with Arden: Arden tried to rekindle his former glories as a family entertainer by releasing a single of his own in 1967: \\"Sunrise Sunset\\", from the musical Fiddler on the Roof, but it failed to chart. Arden returned to music management in 1968 when he signed the Move. He struck gold when two groups formed by ex-Move members, ELO and Wizzard (1972), started having international hits such as \\"See My Baby Jive\\" and \\"Angel Fingers\\" (1973) and ELO with \\"10538 Overture\\" (1972) and \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1973). With later albums like Out of the Blue (1977) and Discovery (1979), ELO became a prominent act. Arden took over management of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul in 1973 who provided him in the following year with the first hit on his new Jet label, \\"No Honestly\\", which was also the theme tune to a hit ITV comedy No, Honestly. By 1976, Arden was embroiled in a lawsuit with the distraught singer over what she claimed was late payment of money owed to her. De Paul commented: She eventually reached a settlement with Arden in 1978. He brought his son David and daughter Sharon into the business, intending to build an Arden showbiz dynasty. Estrangement from Sharon Osbourne and legal problems In 1979, one of Arden's successes, Black Sabbath, sacked their vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Sharon entered into a relationship with Osbourne, and took over his management from her father. Arden was livid. Reportedly, the next time Sharon visited Don, his vicious pet dogs savaged her. She was pregnant at the time and lost the child. Sharon eventually married Osbourne and had no contact with her father for 20 years. In 1979, investigative reporter Roger Cook used the dispute with Lynsey de Paul to probe into Arden's controversial management style on BBC Radio 4's Checkpoint programme. This proved to be a colourful encounter. \\"When you fight the champion you go 15 rounds, you've got to be prepared to go the whole way\\", Arden tells Cook. \\"I'll take you with one hand strapped up my arse. You're not a man, you're a creep.\\" Arden threatened to break the neck of anyone who talked to Cook in his on-air interview. From the late 1970s into the early 1980s, Arden enjoyed the high-rolling lifestyle of a top music mogul. In the mid-1980s, he bought Portland Recording Studios (formerly IBC Studios) from Chas Chandler and installed his son David as manager. The studio's equipment was by this time very outdated and much of the income was being generated by another company who ran half the facility known as RadioTracks, and by George Peckham (Porky Prime Cuts), a well known cutting engineer whose cutting rooms were on the ground floor at the back of the building. Arden had acquired shares in RadioTracks through buying out Chandler without the knowledge of the other directors. Arden's son, known legally as 'David Levy', appeared at the Old Bailey in 1986 for his role in an alleged assault on an accountant working for Jet Records. The incident occurred at the offices at 35 Portland Place. Convicted, Levy spent several months in an open prison. Arden, tried separately on related charges, was acquitted. The drawn-out legal problems meant Arden was unable to attend to business, and legal bills proved a fatal strain on Jet Records, which collapsed. Portland Recording Studios were considerably in arrears with rent to the Prudential, who owned the building at Portland Place, close to the BBC's Broadcasting House. Eventually, the Prudential evicted Jet Records. From 1986 to the mid-1990s, Arden shuttled between his homes in Beverly Hills and Parkside in Wimbledon, London. Reconciliation and final years In 2001 Sharon Osborne told The Guardian: \\"The best lesson I ever had was watching him fuck his business up. He taught me everything not to do. My father's never even seen any of my three kids and, as far as I'm concerned, he never will.\\" Later the same year, at Ozzy's insistence, Sharon and Arden finally reconciled, with Arden taking a walk-on role in the successful reality TV show The Osbournes in 2002. He also met his grandchildren Jack and Kelly for the first time. In August 2004, Sharon Osbourne stated her father had Alzheimer's disease. A \\"tell all\\" biography about Arden's life, entitled Mr Big, was published in 2007 shortly before Arden's death in Los Angeles on 21 July 2007. Sharon Osbourne paid for her father's care in the last years of his life. He was buried in Agecroft Jewish Cemetery, Langley Road, Pendlebury, in Salford on 25 July 2007. On 29 October 2007, a memorial headstone was unveiled at Agecroft Jewish Cemetery by his sister Eileen (Somers) and daughter Sharon Osbourne with her son Jack Osbourne, along with nephew and niece Danny Somers and Cathy Cowan. A line of inscription on the stone reads \\"His beautiful voice will sing in our hearts forever. Shalom\\". Later in the morning a plaque was unveiled at Higher Crumpsall Synagogue, Cheetham Hill, Manchester, with the addition of the words \\"It all started here\\" with a line of musical notes. This refers to the time when Arden (then Harry Levy) sang in the synagogue choir as a very young man. Carnaby Street plaque Carnaby Street plaque On 8 September 2007 a commemorative plaque dedicated to Don Arden and Small Faces was unveiled at 52‚Äì55 Carnaby Street, London, Arden's former offices. Kenney Jones, ex-drummer of Small Faces, said: \\"To honour the Small Faces after all these years is a terrific achievement. I only wish that Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane and the late Don Arden were here to enjoy this moment with me\\".

Her musical career began as a soloist in British folk clubs in the mid 1960s. After working with guitarist John Renbourn, she co-founded Pentangle. Pentangle rapidly established itself as one of the earliest exponents of the British folk rock movement. However, in addition to attracting fans of traditional British folk, they also drew audiences from the rock, pop and psychedelic folk worlds. The original band played a mixture of ballads, blues, and jazz, often blending these genres in the same piece. In 1994, McShee formed a new band named Jacqui McShee's Pentangle which, with a few personnel changes, is still performing today. In 1995 McShee performed as a session singer, along with her husband, drummer Gerry Conway, on the album Active in The Parish by the singer- songwriter David Hughes. It was voted the Q magazine's 'Album of the Year'. In 1998 McShee teamed up with Ulrich Maske to record The Frog and the Mouse and The Cat and the Fiddle.

The battle unfolded from Wheeler's attempt to storm Spanish positions at Las Guasimas de Sevilla, in the jungles surrounding Santiago de Cuba, with the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry and the 10th Regular Cavalry. Approaching on June 24, American reports suggested the Spaniards were digging in with a field gun; however, Cuban scouts contradicted these, revealing the Spaniards were preparing to abandon their position. In fact, the Spanish troops had received orders to fall back on Santiago. Wheeler requested the assistance of the attached Cuban forces in an immediate attack, but their commander, Col. Gonzales Clavel, refused. Wheeler decided to attack anyway, rushing his men forward with two field guns in tow. During the excitement of the battle, Wheeler, a former Confederate officer, supposedly called out \\"Let's go, boys! We've got the damn Yankees on the run again!\\". Wheeler's forces moved to encircle the Spaniards' first battle line, assaulting its front and right flank, but were repulsed. During a pause in the fighting, both sides reinforced their positions. The Spaniards sent forward two companies of the San Fernando Battalion, along with artillery. After midday the U.S. attack was renewed, but the Spanish Provisional de Puerto Rico Battalion once again checked the American assault. After halting the American advance, the Spanish resumed their withdrawal towards Santiago. The battle had cost U.S. forces seventeen dead and fifty-two wounded, while Spanish forces suffered seven dead and fourteen wounded. The American \\"yellow\\" press, unaware of the facts of the ground, described the battle as a rout of the Spaniards; later, historians severely faulted Wheeler for wasting the lives of his men in a frontal assault. Background Troops land, unopposed On June 23, the Spanish garrisons of Sigua, Siboney and Daiquir√≠, retiring before American landings in their vicinity, clashed with a Cuban advance guard column of 250 men under Colonel Carlos Gonz√°lez Clavel near Sevilla, east of Santiago de Cuba. Having lost three dead and 10 wounded in the skirmish and inflicted roughly the same casualties, the Spaniards retired to a lightly entrenched position at Las Guasimas de Sevilla, on the road to Santiago (4 miles northwest of Siboney beach). Brigadier-General Lawton, commander of the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. Volunteers V Corps, had been appointed chief of the landing operation by Major General William Rufus Shafter, Commander-in-Chief of American forces in Cuba. American reports suggested the Spaniards were digging in with a field gun; however, Cuban scouts contradicted these, revealing the Spaniards were preparing to abandon their position.David W. Trask, The War with Spain in 1898 (New York: The Free Press, 1981) p. 220 On the 23rd, Major General Joseph Wheeler, received orders from Shafter to throw pickets to Siboney, but found the enemy in retreat towards Sevilla, with about 100 Cubans engaging their rear.Wheeler, J., 1899, The Santiago Campaign in Campaigns of Wheeler and His Cavalry, Atlanta: Hudgins Publishing Company Wheeler decided to attack the new Spanish positions the next day, which were established three miles from Siboney, with the aid of General Castillo.

These forces were deployed in three echelons: 3 companies of Puerto Rico and 1 company of movilizados covering the crossroads of the Siboney trails, with 2 other companies (San Fernando) guarding the surrounding heights; 3 companies (San Fernando), the engineers, and the artillery holding the Asiento de Sevilla; and 5 companies of Talavera and 1 company of movilizados at La Redonda under Colonel Bory, covering the trails to Justic√≠ and El Pozo. The American side included the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, or \\"Rough Riders\\", under Leonard Wood, the 1st U.S. Regular Cavalry, and the 10th U.S. Regular Cavalry (this consisted of Afro-American soldiers, then called Buffalo soldiers). Supported by artillery, the American forces numbered 964 men, supported by 800 men from Castillo. The first sign the Americans had of the enemy's proximity was a Cuban Army soldier lying dead by the road. The engagement began with shots by U.S. artillery. Spanish infantry returned fire, pinning down the advancing American units with rifle volleys. The Spaniards were armed with superior 7mm 1893 model Mauser repetition rifles that fired round after round of smokeless gunpowder, making them exceedingly difficult to target in return. =1st & 10th Cavalry attack Las Guasimas on the right road= Wheeler's forces moved to encircle the Spaniards' first echelon, assaulting its front and right flank. Brigade commander SMB Young personally supervised the positioning of a battery of one pounder Hotchkiss field guns 900 yards from the Spanish main position on a dominant ridge pointing Southwest. Wanting to be absolutely sure that the troops on the hill were not Spanish, he fired several rounds at the hill. Immediately, two 75mm Spanish Krupp-designed mountain guns returned fire. Satisfied that he was up against the Spanish. Writing in his serialized set of articles (and later book), \\"The Rough Riders,\\" Theodore Roosevelt described the opening phase of the battle that started on the right road and involved the 1st and 10th Regular Cavalry in Chapter III \\"General Young's Fight.\\" as follows: > The denseness of the jungle and the fact that they used absolutely smokeless > powder, made it exceedingly difficult to place exactly where they were, and > almost immediately Young, who always liked to get as close as possible to > his enemy, began to push his troops forward. They were deployed on both > sides of the road in such thick jungle that it was only here and there that > they could possibly see ahead, and some confusion, of course, ensued, the > support gradually getting mixed with the advance. Captain Beck took A Troop > of the Tenth in on the left, next to Captain Galbraith's (K) troop of the > First; two other troops of the Tenth were on the extreme right.

Spanish claims that they had twice repulsed the American attack were not born by any battlefield reports of Troop commanders that day. =1st Volunteer \\"Rough Riders\\" attack Las Guasimas on the left trail= On the left trail, at approximately 7:20am, the four man point patrol 250 yds ahead of L Troop commanded by Captain Alyn Capron came across the dead Spanish soldier killed by a Cuban attack the previous day and which the Cubans had told Wheeler would indicate the proximity of Spanish lines running left and right across the road. When informed of this by Capron, Leonard Wood, who was about 500 yards back on the bridle path and commanding the Rough Riders ordered \\"Silence in the Ranks\\" and immediately deployed several troops to the left under Major Brodie and several troops to the right under Lt. Col. Roosevelt. It was while this deployment was occurring that the point man shot a Spaniard and triggered an immediate return fire by volleys on the part of the Spaniards. Rough Riders on both left and right sides of the trail moved forward and eventually forced the Spaniards back to their second line of trenches. Continuing to advance, the Rough Riders eventually forced the Spanish to withdraw completely from their final positions. Rough Riders from A Troop on the far right linked up with their regular counterparts and helped them seize the Spanish positions on the long finger-like hill to the right of the right road, with both Rough Riders and Regulars meeting at the base of the finger-like hill. By this time it was approximately 9:30. Reinforcements from the regular 9th Cavalry arrived, but it was already 30 minutes after the fight. After halting the American advance, the Spanish inexplicably resumed their ongoing withdrawal towards Santiago's outer defenses instead of profiting from the sharp reverse inflicted on the Americans, allowing \\"American observers [to] unanimously but incorrectly assume their attack had forced the enemy to retreat.\\"Trask, p. 221 Spanish forces suffered 7 dead and 7 wounded, as reported by general Rubin, although these figures are sometimes revised upward. (The discrepancy occurs because the Spaniards at Las Gu√°simas escorted a convoy carrying wounded troopers, as can be read in the order of retreat sent to General Rubin by Lt. General Arsenio Linares on the afternoon of the 24th.) Aftermath Both sides emerged satisfied with their perceived \\"little victory.\\" Rub√≠n had conducted a successful rearguard operation while guaranteeing the safety of his forces, moving away from the menacing, large-caliber guns of the U.S. Navy along the coast and connecting with the Spanish defenders of Santiago.Nofi, A.A., 1996, The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898, Pennsylvania: Combined Books, After satisfactorily drawing \\"first blood\\" at Las Guasimas,Roosevelt, T., 1899, The Rough Riders, New York:C. Scribner's Wheeler concentrated the U.S. Volunteer V Corp with General Calixto Garc√≠a's 5,000 Cubans and invested Santiago's first lines of defense. American morale and confidence soared. The position at Sevilla, briefly occupied by American forces, turned out to be of little value for the aimed advance towards Santiago. General Shafter considered installing his headquarters at La Redonda once the landing was completed, moving it afterwards to El Pozo. The Spanish retreat did unbar the way to the strong points that covered Santiago on the east side, mainly Fort Aguadores, San Juan Hill, Canosa, El Caney, and Fort El Viso, where a set of bloody battles would be waged on July 1. Many of the Spanish officers and soldiers that fought at Las Guasimas de Sevilla were to be in the fight again at the bloody encounter of San Juan Hill. Although Colonel Gonzalez Clavel was criticized by some U.S. officers for not taking part in the attack, he had in fact acted in accordance with military protocol and his directives from General Lawton, the supreme authority during the landing, the Headquarters' orders being not to advance until the landing was completed. Gonzalez Clavel's actions were warmly approved by General Lawton and General Calixto Garcia. Moreover, historical scrutiny of the operation has suggested the Americans erred badly in pursuing a frontal attack against a Spanish position which might have been turned or enveloped with much less difficulty; had the Spaniards elected to hold their ground, Wheeler may have sustained a very severe defeat.Trask, p. 223 An officer with the Rough Riders reflected: \\"It is a good thing we are not at war with England or Germany or France, for we should not last a week.\\"Trask, p. 222 The Spanish deployment around Santiago has likewise been sternly criticized. Observers faulted Linares for failing to challenge the American disembarkation at Siboney altogether and Rub√≠n for yielding the ridges at Las Guasimas‚Äîdespite orders to this effect‚Äîto an American column that had failed to eject him. One historian suggested the Spaniards could not oppose the American advance without exposing themselves to a potentially devastating bombardment from long-range naval guns. The inefficacy of American naval gunfire against shore-based positions throughout the war may cast doubt on this assertion. In fiction This engagement was featured in the miniseries Rough Riders starring Tom Berenger as Theodore Roosevelt. The film depicts it as an American success, albeit a costly one. It was also mentioned in Benjamin's Field: Rescue, the first book of a fictional trilogy by author J. J. Knights. Knights describes the battle as a costly and wasteful venture that had an enduring negative impact on the novel's protagonist, Benjamin Kyner, who fought in the battle as a corporal. =Inaccuracies= There are several inaccuracies in the movie. The Colt Rapid Firing guns seen in the movie's depiction of the battle were never used in the actual fight as the mules that hauled the disassembled weapons, bolted with the first Spanish fire dumping the guns on the ground and temporarily jamming their firing mechanisms beyond easy field repair. Lieutenant Pershing was not in command of the regular cavalry troops. In the final assault, the commander of the two regular and volunteer regiments were no where near each other. The Rough Riders were on the left flank and the regulars were on the right ‚Äì exactly the opposite to the movie. Roosevelt was not at the far right end of the Rough Riders line, near the regulars. Instead, he was on the far left end of the Rough Riders, having been ordered to take over the wounded Major Alexander Brodie's squadron of troops D, E and F. Trooper Harry Hefner was not found dying at the old dystellery house. He was left, wounded, prompted up and continuing to fire. He was found dead after the battle. The man shot along with Hamilton Fish was Trooper Ed Culver. He was not the porter to the officers. =Accuracies= The Spanish Mauser rifles were authentic. The map seen at the final assault is an enlargement of a map drawn by Harpers Monthly War correspondent, Caspar Whitney. Notes References  * Spencer C.

It broadcasts at 95.3 MHz and is operated by students at Harvard College. History Previous logo WHRB was one of America's first college radio stations, initially signing on as a carrier current station on December 2, 1940. After acquiring funding from The Harvard Crimson the station's first call sign was WHCN (Harvard Crimson Network). It broke from the Crimson in 1943 and adopted the call sign WHRV (Harvard Radio Voice). Harvard Radio Broadcasting Co., Inc., the non-profit corporation that owns the station, was formed February 1, 1951, and the current call sign adopted. In order to reach audiences beyond Harvard's campus, the corporation acquired a commercial FM broadcast license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and began regular broadcasting on May 17, 1957 at 107.1 MHz. A few years later, the station changed frequency to 95.3 MHz, where it has remained since. The broadcast area expanded considerably in 1995 when the main transmitter was relocated from atop Holyoke Center (now called the Smith Campus Center) in Harvard Square to its present location atop One Financial Center in downtown Boston. (A facility remains at the Smith site for backup purposes.) Broadcasts went global when internet retransmission of its programs began on November 18, 1999. In 2009, WHRB made available for download the first stand-alone college radio station iPhone \\"app\\".\\"Listen to Harvard radio station on your iPhone\\" (Cambridge Chronicle, March 27, 2009) Accessed 2012-04-13 Programming WHRB is a confederacy of on-air departments, each with its own staff, training requirements, and allocation of airtime. Departments include Classical Music, The Jazz Spectrum, The Blues Hangover, Sports, WHRB News, The Darker Side, and Record Hospital. During the academic year, the station publishes several detailed program guides, describing its regular programming as well as the Orgy periods that end each semester. Orgies (the term is a registered trademark of the station) are consecutive presentations of the entire musical output of composers, record labels, or genres, sometimes running 24 hours a day for a week or more. Station legend has it that these began when an exuberant undergraduate in 1943 decided to celebrate his passing a difficult exam by broadcasting all nine Beethoven symphonies in order. Orgies continue to take place during exam periods, allowing the station to be run with a reduced on-air staff at these busy times. \\"Orgies\\" are broadcast each year throughout most of December, and again from the beginning of May through Harvard's commencement ceremony near the end of that month. Some of WHRB's regular programs have long histories of their own. For example, the country music program Hillbilly at Harvard dates back to 1948,\\"'Hillbilly at Harvard' hosts heady hoedown weekly\\" (Beth Potier, Harvard University Gazette, January 10, 2002) Accessed 2008-09-27 and Sunday Night at the Opera is one of the longest-running programs in its genre in the United States.

The brothers appear as fictional ESPN tape librarians who amuse themselves by watching old, campy sports broadcasts and lampooning them. Produced by Mark Shapiro, Showrunner, Todd Pellegrino, James Cohen and Joseph Maar, Cheap Seats was originally an hour- long program. There were eight one hour-long episodes in the first season, all of which were edited to fit a 30-minute time slot. A number of actors and comedians were featured in various in-studio comedy skits on the show, including Jim Gaffigan, H. Jon Benjamin, Paul Rudd, David Cross, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Eugene Mirman, Michael Ian Black, Nick Kroll, Kristen Schaal, Judah Friedlander, Nick Swardson, Mike Birbiglia, Doug Benson, Kathy Griffin, Carlos Alazraqui and Patton Oswalt. Regular segments Cheap Seats debuted on February 4, 2004, with the opening of the episode showing \\"Ron Parker\\" (played by Michael Showalter), the show's browbeating original host, injured by a shelf full of tapes after it collapses on him, thus forcing the Sklars to fill in as hosts. This skit was part of the show's opening theme until the second season, which featured a new introduction while all references to Parker were removed (although in the theme song which opened episodes of Season 4, the lyrics include \\"going farther than Ron Parker\\"). In addition to the Sklars' regular commentary, Cheap Seats contained regular segments such as \\"Do You Care?\\" (in which the Sklars informed viewers of obscure facts related to the shows they were watching), and \\"The Cheapies\\", where awards in nonsensical categories were given out to in-episode personalities at the show's closing. Other regular segments included \\"Breakdown\\", where then-ESPN analyst Sean Salisbury would comedically break down an athlete's performance; and \\"What Got Cut\\", in which other humorous elements of an episode that were edited due to time constraints were glossed over by the Sklars. \\"Cheap Shot of the Week\\" showcased an athlete featured earlier in the show or in a prior episode at their worst. Original sketches parodying a topic relevant to a particular program were filmed by various comedians. The set featured a wall-mounted poster that would appear on camera prior to commercial breaks, which read \\"Attention ESPN Staff: Do Not Lend Tapes to This Person\\" and contained a photograph of a then-relevant notorious celebrity or athlete, such as Vince McMahon or Barry Bonds. A photo of the Sklars themselves was seen in the series finale. =Live-audience era= Cheap Seats briefly included a live studio audience and virtual laugh track during the second season, starting with an episode on the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Only six shows were produced with this format, and the audience was gone by the premiere of the third season on September 19, 2005. The episodes with the audience were edited to minimize their presence in future reruns. =On the Road= Two episodes were taped in locations other than New York or Los Angeles. In October 2005, ESPN Classic aired \\"Cheap Seats on the Road\\" from the Sklar brothers' hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, where the second Busch Stadium was being torn down because part of it was on the same land on which Busch Stadium III was being constructed. On the episode, the Sklars try to convince city officials to cancel the stadium's demolition by combining the two into a bizarre superstructure. During Season 3, Cheap Seats went to Hillsborough, New Jersey, after a contestant won a contest for the Sklars to film an episode in their home. The episode was titled Cheap Seats on the Road: A Fan's Couch. =Utilityman: The Quest for Cooperstown= This particular episode, which is not officially a part of the Cheap Seats canon, is a 2004 ESPN special (produced by MLB Productions). It features the Sklars going on a trip to St. Louis and then to Cooperstown. The Sklars went all the way to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on a campaign to get beloved 1980s and 1990s St. Louis Cardinals player Jos√© \\"The Utilityman\\" Oquendo inducted for his versatility to play almost any position on the baseball field. (In 1988, Oquendo became the first National League player since 1918 to have played all nine positions in one season.) The special includes the Sklars receiving Oquendo's blessing to lobby for his spot in Cooperstown, collecting signatures for the petition and giving a lackluster presentation to the HOF's committee. After initially denying their claim, the committee agreed to place his plaque in a spot that best fit Oquendo and his skills: the utility closet. It remains there to this day. Source material Most of the broadcasts are from ESPN's archives. Among them: * Wide World of Sports broadcasts * Professional wrestling * Scripps National Spelling Bee * World Series of Poker final tables * Steve Garvey celebrity sporting events Cheap Seats was shot in New York City (with segments filmed in Los Angeles) and had made use of local comedians as guest stars in its sketches. Most of the bit parts were played by stand-up comics whom Jason and Randy met during their years on the road as standup comedians themselves. The show was influenced chiefly by Mystery Science Theater 3000 and MTV's Beavis and Butt-head, as the hosts' comment on the material in the style of a peanut gallery. The \\"Creative Breaking/K-1 Fighting\\" episode guest-starred the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000, in their theatrical silhouette form, cracking on sketches the Sklars performed. ESPN Classic broadcast an all-day marathon of Cheap Seats episodes on Thanksgiving Day in 2004, an homage to the similar marathons of MST3K that were frequently run on Comedy Central during Thanksgiving in the first half of the 1990s. After the first season, a SportsCentury mockumentary was filmed about how its first season made a large impact on the world. Archived interviews from past SportsCentury episodes were edited into the program as if the interview subjects were speaking about the show itself. Series finale A special titled This is Inside Cheap Seats that aired on April 17, 2006, though most of the content therein was fictional. The fourth and final season premiered on June 5, 2006. In the \\"Fall Preview\\" article in the September 25, 2006 issue of ESPN The Magazine, the Sklars announced that \\"after 77 episodes, we're bringing Cheap Seats to a close by cleaning out our video closet in a very special series finale.\\" It aired on November 19, and included racquetball, amateur bowling, curling, model airplane racing, and ping-pong. The episode's main focus was on the Sklars (fictitiously) getting a job as anchors on ESPN's SportsCenter. However, it turned out they weren't hired to be anchors, but as errand boys to do the anchors' bidding, causing the brothers to consider going back to the show, which was currently being hosted by then New York Yankees outfielder Johnny Damon (a fan of the show) and a recurring character called the \\"Score Settler.\\" Before the last episode, ESPN Classic presented 12 previous episodes in a six-hour \\"finale-a-thon.\\" Cheap Seats reruns do not currently air on ESPN Classic or any other network. Selected episodes from the first season were at one time, but are no longer, available for purchase through the iTunes Store.

When the main body of the church was forced out of Nauvoo, Illinois, in the winter of 1846, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848. The building was damaged by fire and a tornado before being demolished. In 1937, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern Latter-day Saint temple. On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple. History Harper's Monthly The Latter Day Saints made preparations to build a temple soon after establishing their headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1839. On April 6, 1841, the temple's cornerstone was laid under the direction of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement and Sidney Rigdon gave the principal oration. At its base the building was long and wide with a clock tower and weather vane reaching to a total height of --a 60% increase over the dimensions of the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple had a full basement which housed a baptismal font. Because the Saints had to abandon Nauvoo, the building was not entirely completed. The basement with its font was finished, as were the first floor assembly hall and the attic. When these parts of the building were completed they were used for performing ordinances (basement and attic) or for worship services (first floor assembly hall). A Sunstone from the original Nauvoo Temple in a case in front of LDS Church's Visitor Center in Nauvoo The Nauvoo Temple was designed in the Greek Revival style by architect William Weeks, under the direction of Joseph Smith. Weeks' design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including Sunstones, Moonstones, and Starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the Three Degrees of Glory in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be \\"a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb's wife\\" (Wandle Mace, Autobiography 207 (BYU Special Collections)). In this regard Mace references John's statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the \\"woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\\" This explains why the Starstones are at the top of the temple (\\"crown of twelve stars\\"), the Sunstones in the middle (\\"clothed with the sun\\") and the Moonstones at the bottom (\\"moon under her feet\\"). Construction was only half complete at the Death of Joseph Smith in 1844. After a succession crisis, Brigham Young was sustained as the church's leader by the majority of Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo. As mob violence increased during the summer of 1845, he encouraged the Latter Day Saints to complete the temple even as they prepared to abandon the city, so portions of it could be used for Latter Day Saint ordinance, such as baptisms for the dead in the basement font. During the winter of 1845-46, the temple began to be used for additional ordinances, including the Nauvoo-era endowment, sealings in marriage, and adoptions. The Nauvoo Temple was in use for less than three months. Most of the Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo, beginning in February 1846, but a small crew remained to finish the temple's first floor, so that it could be formally dedicated. Once the first floor was finished with pulpits and benches, the building was finally dedicated in private services on April 30, 1846, and in public services on 1 May. In September 1846 the remaining Latter Day Saints were driven from the city and vigilantes from the neighboring region, including Carthage, Illinois, entered the near-empty city and vandalized the temple. Initially the church's agents tried to lease the structure, first to the Catholic Church, and then to private individuals. When this failed, they attempted to sell the temple, asking up to $200,000, but this effort also met with no success. On March 11, 1848, the LDS Church's agents sold the building to David T. LeBaron, for $5,000. Finally, the New York Home Missionary Society expressed interest in leasing the building as a school, but around midnight on October 8‚Äì9, 1848, the temple was set on fire by an unknown arsonist. Nauvoo's residents attempted to put out the fire, but the temple was gutted. James J. Strang, leader of the Strangite faction of Latter Day Saints, accused Young's agents of setting fire to the temple. However, Strang's charges were never proven. On April 2, 1849, LeBaron sold the damaged temple to √âtienne Cabet for $2,000. Cabet, whose followers were called Icarians, hoped to establish Nauvoo as a communistic utopia. = Destruction = Nauvoo Temple burning Artist Frederick Piercy passed through Nauvoo in 1853 and produced this artwork of the temple ruins.Lisle G. Brown. BYU Studies 41 no. 4, page 4. https://mds.marshall.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir;=1&article;=1013&context=lib_faculty After the fire of October 9, 1848, only the four exterior walls remained standing. The Icarian leader Cabet was fascinated by the temple and planned to reconstruct it, and a considerable amount of money was spent in the endeavor. However, on May 27, 1850, Nauvoo was struck by a major tornado which toppled one of the walls of the temple. One source claimed the storm seemed to \\"single out the Temple\\", felling \\"the walls with a roar that was heard miles away\\". Cabet ordered the demolition of two more walls in the interests of public safety, leaving only the fa√ßade standing. The Icarians used much of the temple's stone to build a new school building on the southwest corner of the temple lot. By 1857, however, most of Cabet's followers had left Nauvoo and over time many of the original stones for the temple were used in the construction of other buildings throughout Hancock County. In February 1865, Nauvoo's City Council ordered the final demolition of the last standing portion of the temple--one lone corner of the fa√ßade. Soon afterwards, all evidence of the temple disappeared, except for a hand pump over a well that supplied water to the baptismal font. Three of the original sunstones are known to have survived and are on display--one is on loan to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Visitor Center in Nauvoo, one is in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C, and the third and only one that has not been restored is displayed, along with the only moonstone on display, at the Joseph Smith Historic Center of the Community of Christ.  Nauvoo Illinois Temple  From 1937 to 1962, the LDS Church reacquired and restored the lot on which the temple stood. In 1999, church president Gordon B. Hinckley announced the rebuilding of the temple on its original footprint. After two years of construction, on June 27, 2002, the church dedicated the Nauvoo Illinois Temple, whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern LDS temple. Architecture At its base the Nauvoo Temple was long and wide with a tower and weather vane reaching to . The second temple of the Latter Day Saint movement was built 60% larger in dimensions than its predecessor, the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, it had a full basement which housed a baptismal font. =Exterior= The limestone used for the original temple was quarried from a site just west of the temple. Much of that quarry, however, was submerged by rising water behind the Keokuk Dam in 1912. Therefore, Russellville, Alabama, subsidiary of Minnesota's Vetter Stone Company, was chosen by the Church to provide stone for the new temple. Church officials say the quarry was selected because it provided stone that is a close match to the limestone originally used. =Basement= Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple basement The basement of the Nauvoo Temple was used as the baptistry, containing a large baptismal font in the center of the main room. The basement was accessed by spiral staircases at the northwest and southwest corners of the temple. The staircase landing was made of wood and opened to a short hallway heading east, leading to the basement proper. Between the two hallways was an unfinished room sealed off from the rest of the temple, containing an old well that had been dug but never used. The room was discovered by an anti- Mormon mob who broke through the floor of the vestibule above. The basement proper was one hundred feet long and forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sizes on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With the exception of the two rooms at the western end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to the center of the room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font. During an archaeological investigation of the temple site, two highly polished limestone blocks were discovered. Approximately twelve feet east of the entrance to the baptistry and ten feet from either the side of the support piers rested the blocks, roughly fourteen inches square, which projected seven inches (178 mm) above the brick floor. These objects are not mentioned in any account of the basement, and their purpose is unknown. They may have held some type of support columns, dividing the font from the entrance to the basement, or they may simply have been a decorative element beneath a vase or something similar. They may have been part of a feature planned, but not used, in the final construction. The baptismal font The baptismal font (French engraving of 1850) Every visitor who wrote about the temple mentioned the baptismal font. It was clearly the most impressive feature of the temple. There were actually two fonts built during the lifetime of the temple, a temporary wooden one, and a permanent limestone one. The first font was built out of tongue and grooved white pine and painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. The lip of the font was seven feet from the floor. The font's cap and base were carved molding in an \\"antique style\\" and the sides were finished with panel work. Two railed stairways led to the font from the north and south sides. The font was held up by twelve oxen as are almost all temple fonts. They were carved from pine planking that was glued together. They were patterned from the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the region. The head, shoulders and legs protruded beyond the base of the font, and they appeared to have sunk to their knees into the pavement. The most perfect horn that could be found was used to model the animals' horns. A decision was made to replace the wooden font in 1845, apparently because the water caused a mildew odor, and possibly because the wood had begun to rot. The new limestone font followed the pattern of the wooden one. Twelve oxen held up the basin, four on each side and two at each end. The oxen were solid stone and similarly were placed and appeared sunken into the floor. Where the oxen met the basin, the stone was carved to suggest drapery. The ears of the oxen were made of tin. The stairs were moved to an east/west orientation making access to the font easier. A well on the east side of the font provided the water supply. There may have been some kind of tank at the eastern end of the baptistry to store and heat water. =The vestibule= Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple first floor \\"Great Hall\\" and vestibule A flight of eight broad steps led to a landing where two more steps entered three archways. These archways led to the vestibule, the formal entrance to the temple. The archways were approximately nine feet wide and twenty-one feet high. The vestibule itself was forty-three feet by seventeen feet in dimension. It was composed of limestone on all four of its walls. The floor has been speculated to be made of wood, because when the mob occupied the temple briefly in late 1847, they broke through the floor to reach a sealed off room in the basement. Had the floor been limestone, it seems unlikely that they would have dug it up. Two large double doors on the east wall opened to the first floor assembly hall of the lower court, known as the \\"Great Hall\\". Two doors, one on the North wall, and another on the South opened to the landing of two spiral staircases, one in the Northwest corner, and the other in the Southwest corner which led all the way to the attic. These were the only access points to the rest of the building. One report stated that on the east wall of the vestibule was an entablature, similar to the one in the facade, which read in bright gilded letters, \\"THE HOUSE OF THE LORD - Built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - Commenced April 6th, 1841 - HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\\"Nauvoo Temple Page =The stairwells= The two stairwells were constructed of dressed limestone walls. One rose from Northwest corner and the other at the Southwest corner of the temple. They were not true circles but were flatted on four sides. Nor were they symmetrical, being sixteen feet in diameter from East to West and seventeen feet in diameter from North to South. This was done to support landings and other support structures. The staircases, made of wood, provided access to all of the temple from the basement to the attic with a landing at each floor. They had lamps for illumination at night, and had windows for daytime illumination. William Weeks' elevation of the front facade does not show windows at the basement level of the two stairwells, and photographic evidence is inconclusive. However, Joseph Smith's youngest son, David Smith, rendered a painting of the temple's damaged facade, clearly shows half- circular windows at the basement level in the north and south corners of the facade. The staircase in the northwest corner was never completed. It was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the risers. Workmen used this staircase to gain access to the building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845-1846 when persons were using the other staircase to reach the attic for ordinance work. The southwest staircase was completely finished for use. It included lamps for night illumination, and may have been carpeted near the attic landing. =The Great Hall= Entrance to the first floor assembly hall, called the \\"Great Hall\\", was through two large double doors at the east end of the vestibule. The Great Hall occupied the remainder of the floor space East of the vestibule. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall. An arched ceiling spanned some fifty feet in breadth, in the center. the floor was stained wood and the walls were painted white. There were two rooms to the north just past the entrance. It has been suggested that these rooms were used initially by William Weeks, because they are referred by Thomas Bullock as the \\"architect's room.\\" Their eventual intended use is not clear. Pulpits At the East and West ends of the hall were two sets of similar pulpits. Resembling the pulpits used in the Kirtland Temple, and repeated in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting of a group of three semi-circular stands. The lowest level was a drop-table which was raised for use in the sacrament. The pulpits to the East, standing between the windows, were reserved for the Melchizedek Priesthood. Accordingly, each pulpit had initials identifying the priesthood office of the occupant. The top most pulpits read P.H.P., which stood for President of the High Priesthood. The next level down had P.S.Q for President of the Seventy Quorums. Below that, the labels were P.H.Q. which stood for President of the High priests Quorum, and the folding table had the inscription P.E.Q. standing for President of the Elders Quorum. Above the Eastern pulpits, written in gilded letters, along the arch of the ceiling, were the words,\\"The Lord Has Seen Our Sacrifice - Come After Us.\\" The pulpits to the West end were reserved for the Aaronic Priesthood. Each pulpit similarly had initials identifying the priesthood officers who occupied that stand. The highest three pulpits bore the initials P.A.P., which stood for President of the Aaronic Priesthood. The next lower pulpits had P.P.Q., for President of the Priests Quorum. Again, the next had P.T.Q., for President of the Teachers Quorum and on the table at the bottom was written P.D.Q., for President of the Deacons Quorum. Pews Similar to the Kirtland Temple, the hall was fitted with enclosed pews with two aisles running down its length. There were also pews for a band and choir. The room could accommodate up to 3,500 people. Because there were pulpits on both ends of the room, the pews had movable backs which could be swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding - the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood. =First floor mezzanine= Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple first floor mezzanine Access to the first floor mezzanine was directly from landings of the two staircases in the west end of the building. A foyer, corresponding in size to the vestibule below, connected the two stairway landings. Evidence suggests that this mezzanine had fourteen small rooms, seven along each side of the North and South wall. Each room had a small circular window supplying light. These rooms may never have been completed, except perhaps some kind of partition dividing them. =Second floor assembly hall= Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple second floor assembly hall The second floor hall was similar in construction to the Great Hall, except that it included the foyer area where the vestibule would be. This made the room about seventeen feet longer. A stone arch ran north and south between the circular stairwells supporting the massive timbers for the tower above. It had seven large windows along the north and south wide, with four windows along the east wall. The floor would have a similar configuration as the Great Hall with a set of double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed. Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only rough timber, not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches. =Second floor mezzanine rooms= Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple second floor mezzanine The second mezzanine was similar to the first floor mezzanine. It was accessed via the two staircases at the West end of the building. There was no foyer connecting the two stairwells. The second floor mezzanine is also presumed to have been divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along each side of the North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, there is no evidence that these rooms were ever completed, except perhaps for the partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic. =Attic= Floorplan of the Nauvoo Temple attic At the top of the two stairways, opening to a foyer, was the attic floor. The attic was not built of limestone but of wood. It was composed of two sections. The West end of the temple was a flat roofed section that supported the tower. The rest of the attic was a pitched-roof section running the length of the temple. The flat-room section was further divided into two sections, the foyer on the west side, and a suite of rooms to the east. When the attic was used for ordinance work, they were used as a pantry, wardrobe and storage rooms. The area was illuminated by six windows along the foyer's west wall. Outside windows also provided light along the north and south sides. The roof had four octagonal skylight windows to provide light to the interior rooms, in addition to a twenty-foot arched window. The incline of the roof prevented a six-foot-tall man from standing erect along the outside wall. The second room from the south-east corner had a stairway leading to a room in the mezzanine below. =Tower rooms = Rising from the plateau of the attic is an octagonal tower. The tower was divided into three sections, each accessible by a series of stairways leading from the attic to an observation deck at the top. The lowest section was the belfry. The bell was rung for various occasions. Between the observation deck and the belfry was a section containing the four clockwork mechanisms.

The lake has been raised by the Corra Linn Dam and has a dike system at the southern end, which, along with industry in the 1950s-70s, has changed the ecosystem in and around the water. The Kootenay Lake ferry is a year-round toll-free ferry that crosses between Kootenay Bay and Balfour. The lake is a popular summer tourist destination.  Geography  Kootenay Lake is a long, narrow and deep fjord-like lake located between the Selkirk and Purcell mountain ranges in the Kootenay region of British Columbia. It is one of the largest lakes in British Columbia, at 104 km in length and 3‚Äì5 km in width. It is, in part, a widening of the Kootenay River, which in turn drains into the Columbia River system at Castlegar, British Columbia. Although oriented primarily in a north-south configuration, a western arm positioned roughly halfway up the length of the lake stretches 35 km to the City of Nelson. The lake is 532m above sea level, with the adjacent mountains rising up to a maximum of approximately 2700m. The average residence for water in the lake is 1.5 years, although the west arm has a much faster rate of water replacement; about 3‚Äì4 days.Kootenay Lake, Retrieved February 15, 2011 Beach at Kokanee Creek Provincial Park Kootenay Lake was formed through river erosion and, later, glaciation. The erosion began during the late Cretaceous until ice filled the resulting valley in the Pleistocene. When the valley was filled with ice, glaciers from the mountains (the Selkirks and Purcells) fed the valley's ice mass. The glacier that occupied what is now the west arm of Kootenay Lake flowed into the Kootenay ice mass. As the ice melted from this glacier, drainage flowed over an area near what is now Nelson, causing the west arm of the lake to drain toward the west. A large moraine formed near what is now the large bend in the Kootenay River near Libby, Montana. As ice melted, a lake formed behind the moraine and drained southward over top of it. The southerly drainage over the moraine eventually stopped and the Kootenay River began to follow its present course.  History  Kootenay Lake is part of the traditional territory of the Sinixt and Ktunaxa peoples. These native populations used the lake and associated river systems as part of their seasonal migration and trading routes.International Lake Environment Committee, Promoting Sustainable Management of the World's Lakes and Reservoirs, KOOTENAY LAKE, Retrieved February 15, 2011. In 1958 the Kootenay Lake Crossing, an electrical power line, was built, running across the north arm of Kootenay Lake. It was destroyed in 1962 by protestors and rebuilt later that year.Fortis BC, Retrieved February 15, 2011. The lake originally seasonally flooded an approximately 80 km long marsh lying to the lake's south within the Creston Valley. However, this has now been diked and converted to commercial agriculture. A smaller wetland area has been protected in this area. In 1931, Corra Linn Dam was built at the outflow from Kootenay Lake, where it once again became a river.BC geographical names, Corra Linn Dam, Retrieved February 15, 2011. The dam provides flood control and winter power generation by raising the normal water level by two meters. Just down river is Bonnington Falls, today the site of several hydroelectric dams. In 2003 the lake discharged 16.9 billion cubic metres of water. High water for that year was a normal 533 metres, the record is 537 metres in 1961.http://www.ijc.org/rel/boards/Kootenay_Lake/klbc_2003_annual_report.pdf In 1967 as part of the Columbia River Treaty the Duncan Dam was constructed above Kootenay Lake on the Duncan River, creating a 7,145 hectare reservoir for flow control. Also part of the treaty Libby Dam in Montana, was completed in 1975.  Fauna  Kootenay Lake is populated with many species of fish, such as Rainbow trout, Bull Trout, Burbot, Mountain Whitefish, White Sturgeon, Brook Trout, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch and Kokanee Salmon. There was a large decrease in the numbers of Kokanee in the west arm of the lake in the late 1970s. The salmon fishery was closed in 1980 and remains closed as of 2011. The reason for the decline is not known; possibilities include reduced numbers of Mysis relicta (which had been introduced as a food source for the Kokanee in 1949)Fly Fish BC, Kootenay Lake Karma, Retrieved February 15, 2011. into the west arm due to the increased control of water levels, the disruption of rearing habitat due to recurring drawdown of the lake, reduced productivity of benthos due to the reduction of the amount of nutrients into the lake (after the close of the fertilizer plant), overfishing in the 1960s to 1970s or competition between the Mysis relicta and immature fish. In 1990 the lake's southern Kokanee stocks neared extinction, and an experimental fertilizing program was started, with some success.Royal BC Museum, Retrieved February 15, 2011.

He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the Old Faithful bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. He also competed in the men's individual pursuit at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree has been very open about living with bipolar disorder and depression, and the fact that he has attempted suicide three times in his life, using his experiences as a means of encouraging other sportspeople to talk about their own mental health. His life and exploits have been dramatised in the 2006 film The Flying Scotsman and more recently in the documentary film Battle Mountain: Graeme Obree's Story, which follows his journey to Battle Mountain, Nevada to compete in the 2013 World Human Powered Speed Championships. In March 2010 he was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame. Biography =Origins= Obree was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire but has lived almost all his life in Scotland and considers himself Scottish. An individual time triallist, his first race was a 10-mile time trial to which he turned up wearing shorts, anorak and Doc Marten boots. He thought the start and finish were at the same place and stopped where he had started, 100 metres short of the end. He had started to change his clothes when officials told him to continue. He still finished in \\"about 30 minutes.\\" Obree suffers from bipolar disorder.Graeme Obree reveals he is gay He attempted suicide in his teens by gassing himself. He was saved by his father, who had returned early from work. In the 1990s he took an overdose of aspirin washed down by water from a puddle. He had personality problems, sniffed the gas he used to weld bicycles, and was being chased for ¬£492 owed in college fees. The bike shop that he ran failed and he decided the way out of his problems was to attack the world hour velodrome record. It had been held for nine years by Francesco Moser, at 51.151 kilometres. Obree said: :The record had fascinated me since Moser broke it. It was the ultimate test ‚Äì no traffic,The slipstream from passing traffic can increase the speed of time- triallists on busy roads one man in a velodrome against the clock. I didn't tell myself that I will attempt the record, I said I would break it. When your back is against the wall, you can say it's bad or you can say: 'I'll go for it.' I decided, that's it, I've as good as broken the record. =The bike= Obree had built frames for his bike shop and made another for his record attempt. Instead of traditional dropped handlebars it had straight bars like those of a mountain bike. He placed them closer to the saddle than usual and rode with the bars under his chest, his elbows bent and tucked into his sides like those of a skier. Watching a washing machine spin at 1,200rpm led him to take the bearings, which he assumed must be of superior quality, and fit them to his bike.Cycling Weekly, 29 March 1997 Obree later regretted admitting to the bearings experiment, because journalists referred to that before his achievements and other innovations.Graeme Obree: Homegrown Hero Obree called his bike \\"Old Faithful\\". It has a narrow bottom bracket, around which the cranks revolve, to bring his legs closer together, as he thought this is the \\"natural\\" position. As shown in the film, he thought a tread of \\"one banana\\" would be ideal. The bike has no top tube, so that his knees did not hit the frame. The chainstays are not horizontal to the ground. Thus the cranks can pass with a narrow bottom bracket. The fork had only one blade, carefully shaped to be as narrow as possible. A French writer who tried it said the narrow handlebars made it hard to accelerate the machine in a straight line but, once it was at speed, he could hold the bars and get into Obree's tucked style. :At a high enough speed, [I could] tuck in my arms. And, above all, get in a very forward position on the bike, on the peak of the saddle. The Obree position isn't advantageous simply aerodynamically, it also allows, by pushing the point of pedalling towards the rear, to benefit from greater pressure while remaining in the saddle. You soon get an impression of speed, all the greater because you've got practically nothing [deux fois rien] between your hands. Two other things I noticed after a few hundred metres: I certainly didn't have the impression of turning 53 √ó 13, and the Obree position is no obstruction to breathing. But I wasn't pedalling at 55 km/h, 100 turns of the pedals a minute, yet my arms already hurt. = Taking the record = Obree attacked Moser's record, on 16 July 1993, at the Vikingskipet velodrome in Norway.The track, 250m round, was built of Siberian pine in three and a half weeks to convert the indoor speed skating arena to a velodrome for the cycling world championships, and was removed shortly afterwards. He failed by nearly a kilometre. He had booked the track for 24 hours and decided to come back the next day. The writer Nicholas Roe said: :To stop his aching body seizing up, Obree then took the unusual measure of drinking pint upon pint of water so that he had to wake up to go to the lavatory every couple of hours through the night. Each time he got up, he stretched his muscles. On the next weary day, he was up and out within minutes, at the deserted velodrome by 7:55 am and on the track ready to start just five minutes after that. He had barely slept. He had punished his body hugely the previous day. Surely this was a waste of time? Obree said: :I was Butch Cassidy in terms of swagger. I didn't want any negativity. This was blitzkrieg. I'm going in there. Let me do it. I'm not going to be the timorous guy from Scotland. That's what the difference was. Purely mental state. The day before, I had been a mouse. Now I was a lion. On 17 July 1993, Obree set a new record of 51.596 kilometres, beating Moser's record of 51.151 kilometres by 445 metres. =Losing the record= Obree's triumph lasted less than a week. On 23 July 1993, the British Olympic champion, Chris Boardman broke Obree's record by 674 metres, riding 52.270 km at Bordeaux during the rest day of the Tour de France. His bike had a carbon monocoque frame, carbon wheels, and a triathlon handlebar. Their rivalry grew: a few months later Obree knocked Boardman out of the world championship pursuit to take the title himself.Cycling Weekly, 23 September 1995, p22 =Regaining the record= Francesco Moser, whose record Obree had beaten, adopted Obree's riding position‚Äîadding a chest pad‚Äîand established not an outright world record but a veterans' record of 51.84 kilometres. He did it on 15 January 1994, riding in the thin air of Mexico City as he had for his outright record, whereas Obree and Boardman had ridden at close to sea level. Obree retook the record on 27 April 1994, using the track that Boardman had used at Bordeaux. He had bolted his shoes to his pedals, to avoid what had happened in the final of the national pursuit championship, when he pulled his foot off the pedal during his starting effort.Bolting shoes to the pedals was pioneered by the Australian sprinter John Nicholson at the world championship in Leicester in 1970. Riders today use cleats on the soles of their shoes, which combined with specially designed pedals, make the accidental separation of the shoe from the pedal highly unlikely when the tension is properly adjusted. He rode 52.713 kilometres, a distance beaten on 2 September 1994 by the Spanish Tour de France winner, Miguel Indur√°in. =Old Faithful banned= The world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale, grew concerned that changes to bicycles were making a disproportionate influence to track records. Among other measures, it banned his riding position: he did not find out until one hour before he began the world championship pursuit in Italy.\\"Cycling's world pursuit champion has ridden into trouble again\\", The Independent Judges disqualified him when he refused to comply. The magazine Cycling Weekly blamed \\"petty-minded officialdom.\\" Obree developed another riding position, the \\"Superman\\" style, his arms fully extended in front, and he won the individual pursuit at the world championships with this and Old Faithful in 1995. That position was also banned.\\"Obree's riding position banned\\", The Independent However, in May 2014 the UCI relented, acknowledging that fixing the kind of equipment to be used was hindering technical progress. It restored previous banned world records, from 2000, now to be described as \\"Best hour performance\\". The original Old Faithful bike is on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, while two near-replicas built for use in the Flying Scotsman film are displayed in the Riverside Transport Museum in Glasgow. In March 2018, Obree tested another replica of Old Faithful in the Mercedes-Benz F1 team's wind tunnel to gauge the aerodynamic efficiency of his various riding positions on the bike, having never previously participated in wind-tunnel testing before. It was found that the (drag coefficient) of Obree's initial \\"tuck\\" or \\"crouch\\" position was 0.17, compared to a conventional 1990s bike position of 0.20 and a modern conventional position of 0.188, leading to an estimated gain in speed of about 2-2.5 km/h over his rivals in the nineties and a gain of 1.5 km/h over contemporary track cyclists: meanwhile the \\"Superman\\" position was found only to be marginally more efficient than the 1990s conventional position, and less efficient than the modern conventional position. Obree however noted that the discomfort of the \\"crouch\\" position takes a lot of energy out of the rider through holding the hands and shoulders in place, whilst the \\"Superman\\" position was much more manageable. =Other achievements= Obree was individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He broke the British 10-mile individual time trial record in 1993, won the RTTC 50-mile championship the same year (a record 1h 39m 1s), and won the 25-mile championship in 1996. In 1997 he joined forces with coach Joe Beer and clocked 18m 36s in a 10-mile time trial (V718 Hull) and next day won the British Cycling Federation 25-mile championship - this was part of building towards an hour record attempt that was to be eventually shelved. The writer Peter Bryan, of The Times, said: > To see Obree in full flight, shoulders hunched and elbows tucked into his > ribs, is a memorable sight. His face contorted with pain illustrates the > effort he is putting in. And yet, not too many minutes after he has finished > a ride the champion is sufficiently relaxed to talk with a queue of > pressmen. =Professional career= Obree rode his hour records as an amateur. He took a professional licence after winning his first world championship, telling Bryan: \\"I reckon I can make more money on the bike than I get from unemployment benefit.\\" He joined Le Groupement, a French team but did not attend a meeting in Les Carroz d'Ar√¢ches (fr) and was fired for \\"lack of professionalism.\\" Obree had been racing in Florida when the team first met. But he was on holiday there when the team met again for publicity photographs. He got to the next get-together but flew to Paris instead of Lille, where the meeting was held. The team manager, Patrick Valcke, said: :\\"If a rider has that attitude, it's best to stop working together as soon as possible. We paid for his tickets [to fly from Glasgow to Geneva] and he didn't even turn up, didn't even phone to explain why he was not coming. He said that he did not want to leave his family so soon after the death of his brother (see below) but he could have phoned to tell us that. I don't want any more to do with him.\\" Obree said: \\"I was too ill to attend the get-together and had no success when I attempted to contact team officials on 1 January. My wife, Anne, who is a nurse, insisted I was not well enough to travel to France.\\" The Le Groupement team fell apart after a short time, when the sponsoring company was involved in scandal, with accusations that it was nothing but a pyramid selling scheme. Some of the team members claimed that they were owed money, and their wages had not been paid. =Attitude to doping= Obree said of his short professional career: :\\"I still feel I was robbed of part of my career. I was signed up to ride in the prologue of the Tour back in 1995, but it was made very obvious to me I would have to take drugs. I said no, no way, and I was sacked by my team. So there I was, 11 years later, sitting there waiting for the Tour cyclists to come by, and something welled up in me. I feel I was robbed by a lot of these bastards taking drugs. I also hate the way that people think anyone who has ever achieved anything on a bike must have been taking drugs. I was surprised how resentful I felt when I was in Paris. It had obviously been simmering away in there for years. That's something new I'll have to talk to my therapist about.\\" In 1996, he told the magazine L'√âquipe: :\\"In my opinion, 99 percent of riders at √©lite level take EPO or a similar drug, not particularly to dope themselves but to be at the same level as the others. And that's rather sad.\\"L'Equipe Magazine, France 19 October 1996\\"A mon avis, 99% des coureurs de l'√©lite prennent aujourd'hui de l'EPO ou une drogue similaire. Pas forc√©ment pour se doper, mais pour √™tre au m√™me niveau que les autres. Et c'est plut√¥t navrant.\\" His web site says: :\\"AND by the way, I never took drugs to improve my performance at any time as has been happening in the sport for a long time. I will be willing to stick my finger into a polygraph test if anyone with big media pull wants to take issue. In other words, if you buy a signed poster now it will not be tarnished later.\\" = Further suicide attempt = Obree's brother, Gordon, died in a car crash in October 1994, and Graeme Obree again slid in and out of depression. In 2001 he was found unconscious at Bellsland Farm in Kilmaurs, 12 km from his Ayrshire home. The Obree family horse was stabled there, and he was discovered by a woman checking a barn. He had tried to hang himself. His wife, Anne, said he had been diagnosed as having severe bipolar disorder three years earlier. =Present day= Obree is divorced from his wife, with whom he has two children. He continues to race occasionally in individual time trials for Ayrshire-based Fullarton Wheelers cycling club. In May 2005, he crashed in the rain in the national 10-mile time trial championship near Nantwich in Cheshire. He was a member of the winning three-man club squad that took the team title in the Scottish 10-mile championship in May 2006. In December 2006, he competed in the track event, Revolution 15, in a four kilometre pursuit challenge. In January 2011, Obree disclosed in an interview with the Scottish Sun that he is gay and that his difficulty with coming to terms with his sexual orientation contributed to his earlier suicide attempts. \\"I was brought up by a war generation; they grew up when gay people were put in jail. Being homosexual was so unthinkable that you just wouldn't be gay. I'd no inkling about anything, I just closed down.\\" He came out to his family in 2005. =New Hour record attempt= In May 2009, Obree announced that he would make an attempt at the \\"Athlete's Hour\\" record on a bike he had built himself during 2009. Obree said in October 2009 that the attempt had been cancelled as the bike he'd built himself was not suitable for the conditions. He will not be attempting this again. In December 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame while in March 2010, he was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame. =Human-Powered Vehicle land speed record= In December 2011, Obree announced that he would make an attempt at the human-powered vehicle (HPV) land speed record, hoping to hit 100 mph. In May 2012, he revealed that the bike he is building for this attempt is a prone bike. The attempt was originally to take place in Britain, and the record speed was then . However, he competed in the 2013 World Human Powered Speed Championships in Battle Mountain, Nevada, where the record was also set. He achieved a speed of on the morning of Friday, 13 September. While Obree did not break the HPV land speed record, he did set a new record for a rider in the prone position. The previous day, Obree had set a speed of , which was a record speed in the prone position on a two-wheeled HPV (the overall prone record being held by a trike).  Book and films  He published his autobiography in 2003 titled The Flying Scotsman.Published by Birlinn, UK, with a foreword by Francesco Moser He said: \\"It started with the psychologist saying it would do me good and ended up as my life story.\\" A film based on the book premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2006, starring Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Boyd. In November 2006 Metro-Goldwyn Mayer bought world distribution rights and the film was released in the US on 29 December 2006; it was given a UK release on 29 June 2007. The DVD was released in the UK on 5 November 2007. Battle Mountain: Graeme Obree's Story, a documentary film about Obree's appearance at the 2013 World Human Powered Speed Championships in Battle Mountain, Nevada, premiered at the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film, directed by David Street with music by Alun Woodward of Chemikal Underground, went on public release on 21 March 2016, with a tour of cinemas featuring a question-and-answer session with Obree following screenings. The film was crowdfunded through the Kickstarter website.

He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, grew up in Winnipeg and first became involved in politics at the age of twelve. He joined the British Columbia Social Credit Party when it was still a fringe organization. Smith obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and History from the University of British Columbia, a Bachelor of Education from Simon Fraser University and worked as a teacher in Birtle, Manitoba. He sought the Progressive Conservative nomination for a February 1969 provincial by-election in the Birtle-Russell electoral division, but lost to Harry Graham. He later became involved with the New Democratic Party (NDP). He was elected to the Winnipeg City Council in 1980 for the division of Sargent Park, retaining his seat until 1986. In the provincial election of 1986, Smith was elected in the Winnipeg riding of Ellice, defeating Progressive Conservative Seech Gajadharsingh by over 2,000 votes. He was not appointed to the cabinet of Howard Pawley, and lost to Liberal Avis Gray by 724 votes in the 1988 election. In 1998, Smith came out of political retirement to run for the Winnipeg City Council again, representing the Daniel McIntyre Ward on city council. In 2002, he was re-elected over Maureen Pendergast by almost 3000 votes. Despite being the incumbent candidate, Smith lost the endorsement of the NDP going into the 2010 civic election in favour of Pat Martin's constituency assistant Keith Bellamy. Smith decided to contest this decision and ran as an independent in the 2010 Winnipeg civic election. On October 27, 2010, Smith won a narrow victory over four other candidates and retained his seat as councillor for the Daniel McIntyre ward. In 2004, he filled out the NDP nomination forms for a provincial by-election in the riding of Minto, but soon withdrew from the race. In the city council election of October 22, 2014, he lost to Cindy Gilroy. Smith died on March 12, 2017 at the age of 80 following a brief illness. He was not married and did not have any children.

Biography Johnson was born in Lincolnshire in England, the second son of John Henry Johnson and Anna Braithwaite. He attended Magdalen College School, Oxford and then earned a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford. He studied the classics and Arabic in preparation for a career in the Egyptian Civil Service. In Egypt, he became a papyrologist, discovering a papyrus by Theocritus that was 900 years older than any such previously-discovered manuscript. Johnson returned to Oxford during World War I, physically unfit for military service. He became Assistant Secretary to the Delegates of Oxford University Press. In 1918, he married Dorothea, the daughter of his supervisor Charles Cannan. They had a son whom they named Charles, and a daughter, Paulla. In 1925, Johnson became Printer to the University at Oxford, and in 1928, he was awarded an Honorary D. Litt for his work on the Oxford English Dictionary. During World War II, in addition to his printing responsibilities, he became responsible for security at Oxford University Press, living on-site until his retirement in 1946. During that time, he became a collector of what he called \\"printed ephemera\\", establishing \\"The Constance Meade Memorial Collection of Ephemeral Printing\\" at Oxford University Press. Johnson's definition of printed ephemera was \\"Everything which would ordinarily go into the wastepaper basket after use, everything printed which is not actually a book.\\" He continued to build up the collection until his death. In 1968 the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library, where it is now known as the \\"John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera\\"; the collection has been substantially enlarged since its acquisition by the Bodleian, and continues to grow.

At birth he was likely heir to great wealth, but due to the political failure of his father and uncle, he inherited very little. He was the son of John Neville, Earl of Northumberland (and later Marquess Montagu) and a nephew of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. George's mother was Isobel Ingoldsthorpe, only daughter and heiress of Sir Edmund Ingoldsthorpe and Joan Tiptoft. At birth George was the likely or possible heir to considerable property. Most definite were the property of his father's earldom, his mother's Ingoldsthorpe estates, and the more modest jointure of his parents. The latter two were by themselves sufficient to support a baron. He was also heir presumptive (after his father) to the Neville estates of his uncle Warwick. These were entailed to heirs male and the earl had only daughters. Finally, George was likely to inherit (after his mother and grandmother) a third share of the Tiptoft property held by his childless grand-uncle, John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester, whose sister and heiress Joan was George's maternal grandmother. These inheritances altogether would yield around 4,000 pounds a year, comparable to the 4,500 pounds annual income of the Duke of Clarence, the king's brother and the greatest magnate of the time. George Neville was made Duke of Bedford in 1470, as the intended husband of Elizabeth of York. The title had lain unused since John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, died on 14 September 1435. However, his father and his uncle Warwick rebelled against King Edward IV the following year and were slain. An act of attainder was never passed against them, but George received no inheritance from them or from his maternal ancestors. An act of Parliament in 1475 gave the Neville inheritance in the north of England to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, husband of one of Warwick's daughters.Ross 30 George had a half-interest in the estates of his maternal grandfather, Sir Edmund Ingoldsthorpe, and his maternal grandmother, Joan Tiptoft.Ross 30 footnote Shortly before he came of age in 1478 he was denied the title of duke by act of Parliament, ostensibly for lack of money to maintain the style of a duke. The title was subsequently given to the infant George Plantagenet of York, the 3rd son of King Edward IV.

Life  Sy Oliver was born in Battle Creek, Michigan. His mother was a piano teacher and his father was a multi-instrumentalist who made a name for himself demonstrating saxophones at a time that instrument was little used outside of marching bands. Oliver left home at 17 to play with Zack Whyte and his Chocolate Beau Brummels and later with Alphonse Trent. He sang and played trumpet with these bands, becoming known for his \\"growling\\" horn playing.

As a composer, one of his most famous songs was \\"T'ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)\\", which he co- wrote with Trummy Young in 1939. In 1933, Oliver joined Jimmie Lunceford's band as a trumpet player, arranger and songwriter. He contributed many hit arrangements for the band, including \\"My Blue Heaven\\" and \\"Ain't She Sweet\\", as well as his original composition \\"For Dancers Only\\" which in time became the band's theme song. He was co-arranger with pianist Ed Wilson; Oliver primarily taking the up-tempo numbers, Wilcox the ballads. Oliver's arrangements \\"were a dashing parade of innovation that rivaled Ellington's for consistency and originality.\\" The Rough Guide, p.483 In 1939, when band leader Tommy Dorsey decided he wanted a swing band, his first step was to hire Oliver as an arranger away from Lunceford for $5,000 more a year.The Rough Guide Oliver then became one of the first African Americans with a prominent role in a white band when he joined Tommy Dorsey. (Fletcher Henderson, another African American composer/arranger, had joined the Benny Goodman orchestra as the arranger some years earlier.) He led the transition of the Dorsey band from Dixieland to modern big band. His joining was instrumental in Dorsey luring several major jazz players, including Buddy Rich to his band. With Dorsey, Oliver continued sharing arranging duties with other arrangers, primarily Axel Stordahl, Oliver doing up tempo tunes, Stordahl ballads. As James Kaplan puts it, \\"Tommy Dorsey's band got a rocket boost in 1939 when Dorsey stole Lunceford's great arranger Sy Oliver.\\"James Kaplan, \\"Frank: The Voice\\", Doubleday, New York, 2010, p. 647 His arrangement of \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" was a big hit for Dorsey in 1946, as were his compositions \\"Yes, Indeed!\\" (a gospel-jazz tune that was later recorded by Ray Charles), \\"Opus One\\" (originally titled as \\"Opus No. 1\\", but changed to suit the lyric that was added later), \\"The Minor Is Muggin'\\", and \\"Well, Git It\\". Oliver left Dorsey after seven years, in 1946, and began working as a freelance arranger and as music director for Decca Records. One of his more successful efforts as an arranger was the 1961 Frank Sinatra album I Remember Tommy, a combined tribute to their former boss. June 26, 1950, Sy Oliver and his Orchestra recorded the first American version of C'est si bon (Henri Betti, Andr√© Hornez, Jerry Seelen) and La Vie en rose (Louiguy, √âdith Piaf, Mack David) for Louis Armstrong. In 1974 he began a nightly gig with a small band at the Rainbow Room in New York. He continued that gig until 1984, with occasionally time off to make festival or other dates, including at the Roseland Ballroom in New York.

It is 7,426 metres long and 162 m high. It impounds the large Guri Reservoir (Embalse de Guri) with a surface area of . The Guri Reservoir that supplies the dam is one of the largest on earth. The hydroelectric power station was once the largest worldwide in terms of installed capacity, replacing Grand Coulee HPP, but was surpassed by Brazil and Paraguay's Itaipu. History and design The dam and reservoir as seen from space. Technical and economic feasibility studies were begun in 1961, conducted by the Harza Engineering Company. An international consortium of six firms was awarded the contract for the construction of the plant, including four United States companies participating under the Alliance for Progress. In 1963, construction began for the hydroelectric power station Guri in the Necuima Canyon, about 100 kilometers upstream from the mouth of the Caron√≠ River in the Orinoco. By 1969, a 106 m high and 690 m long dam with the official name of Central Hidroel√©ctrica Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (previously named Central Hidroel√©ctrica Ra√∫l Leoni from 1978 to 2000) had been built. It created a reservoir which is the largest fresh water body of water in Venezuela and one of the largest man-made blackwater lakes ever created, with its water level at 215 metres above sea level. The power station had a combined installed capacity of 1750 megawatts (MW). By 1978, the capacity had been upgraded to 2065 MW, generated by ten turbines. Because the electricity demand grew so fast, 1976 saw the beginning of a second building stage: a 1300 m long gravity dam was built, another spillway channel and a second powerhouse containing 10 turbines of 725 MW each. The powerhouse's inside walls were decorated by the Venezuelan kinetic artist Carlos Cruz-D√≠ez. This increased the dam's dimensions to 162 m in height and to 7426 m (according to other sources 11,409 m) in crest length. The water level rose to 272 mCVG Electrificaci√≥n Del Caron√≠, C.A.: Cifras 2006, . Caracas, Agosto 2007 and the reservoir grew in size and volume to a capacity of 138 billion cubic m for flood storage or floodwater evacuation. The structure was inaugurated on 8 November 1986. Since 2000, there is an ongoing refurbishment project to extend the operation of Guri Power Plant by 30 years. This project is to create 5 new runners and main components on Powerhouse II, and close to the end of 2007 is starting the rehabilitation of four units on Powerhouse I. Generating failures and blackouts =2010= Due to government policy in effect from the 1960s to minimize power production from fossil fuels in order to export as much oil as possible, 74% of Venezuela's electricity comes from renewable energy like hydroelectric power. the Guri Dam alone supplied more than a third of Venezuela's electricity Part of the power generated at Guri is exported to Colombia and Brazil. The risks of this strategy became apparent in 2010, when, due to a prolonged drought, water levels were too low to produce enough electricity to meet demand. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government imposed rolling blackouts to combat low water levels behind the dam due to drought. =2016= In April 2016, water levels again became low, and the government announced blackouts of 4 hours per day, for 40 days or until water levels stabilized. Government employees were told not to come to work on Fridays, president Maduro urged women not to use hair dryers, and the electricity supplied to fifteen shopping malls was rationed. Three days were added to the 2016 Easter national holiday, allowing for a one-week shutdown of public services and private businesses. =2019= On 7 March 2019, shortly before 17:00 local time, the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Hydroelectric Plant failed, leaving most of Venezuela's 32 million citizens in darkness. In the days following the onset of the blackout, at least four attempts were made to restart the key San Ger√≥nimo B substation, which distributes 80% of the country's electricity, but all failed, and no date was set for the plant's reactivation. Government officials claim the blackout was \\"an act of sabotage\\", while experts attributed the failure to aging infrastructure and insufficient maintenance.

History Holy Trinity Church, The modest Gothic Revival structure was built in 1847 by architect Henry Bowyer Lane, who also designed Little Trinity Anglican Church at 425 King Street East, and St. George the Martyr Church at 197 John Street (only the clock tower remains). The funds for its construction were a gift from Mary Lambert Swale of Settle, England. Swale had originally made the donation anonymously, but her name was eventually revealed. She had provided the gift with the stipulation that the church be open to the public, with no reserved pews. Other Torontonians assisted with the completion of this public project including Alexander Dixon who assisted with the project both financially and politically. The lands for the church were given by the Honourable John Simcoe Macaulay in 1845. Macaulay's cottage, 'Teraulay' was then situated on an estate named Macaulay's Fields which extended from present day Yonge to Bay (then known as Teraulay) Streets, and from today's Albert Street (then known as Jeremy Street) to just south of Dundas Street. Building lots filled in the edges of the property to the north, south, and west of the Trinity site, and the central portion of the property was donated for the construction of the church. Eventually the east side of the Trinity site was sold to permit retail frontage on Yonge Street, enclosing Trinity Church, although a roadway connected Trinity to Yonge Street. The building was dedicated on October 27, 1847.https://archive.org/stream/landmarkstoronto04robeuoft#page/17/mode/1up Holy Trinity was the fourth Anglican church in Toronto, after St. James' Cathedral, Little Trinity, and St. George the Martyr Church. The church's first rector was Henry Scadding. Architecture Designed by Henry Bowyer Lane, the Church of the Holy Trinity is approximately five storeys tall. Though the scale of the church is modest, its height is emphasized through details which point upward. In relation to human scale, the church feels big, tall, and strong. Even though it is surrounded by modern buildings, its role as a terminating vista has been preserved for the pedestrian lane from Bay Street to Trinity Square and also for Hagerman Street. It is visible from Toronto City Hall's podium green roof. The church adheres to the Gothic church architecture characteristics with a cruciform plan. The church's Gothic Revival design is evident in the materials and elements of the building. This style emphasizes verticality and light, which is achieved through the use of tall stained glass windows and twin turrets outlining the main entrance of the church. Like many Gothic churches, the Church of the Holy Trinity uses limestone for its foundation and window tracery, as well as sandstone, brick, and wood. This church follows the Gothic church characteristic of a cruciform in plan. The pointed arch is repeated throughout the whole building, present in the doors, windows, and Gothic vault. The stained glass windows are translucent and allow daylight into the church, each with its own unique design. Together, the variety of window designs speaks about the Bible and the history of the building. A unique element on the exterior of the church is the line of colourful shields under the eaves. Mary Lambart Swale died at the age of 25 and gave the Toronto diocese a gift of 5,000 sterling to build a church. She requested that the church in the Gothic style, that the name be Holy Trinity, that the reading desk and pulpit not be placed as to obstruct the view of patrons, and that the pews were to be free for everyone forever. Along with the original gift she also gave a Font that can still be found in the church today. The Gothic style chosen for The Church of the Holy Trinity was the late medieval Tudor Style. The four pointed arch (also known as the Tudor Arch) in combination with the tall and narrow oriel windows are of Tudor style. The decorative chimney caps on most of the eleven chimneys are also in the style of Tudor architecture. The two towers flanking the west entrance of the church became a landmark of Toronto in the mid-nineteenth century and could be seen throughout the city. There are emblems, symbols, and initials on crests under the eaves of the entire exterior, a unique feature of the church. These crests bear the initials of early rectors, the architect, and the builder. The symbols include an open book, King Soloman's head, and several other masonic symbols. A brochure can be picked up at the entrance to the church showing and explaining the crests. Community involvement Located at 19 Trinity Square with offices and program space at 6 and 10 Trinity Square, the Church of the Holy Trinity is surrounded by the Toronto Eaton Centre on the north, south, and east sides, a Marriott hotel and the Ted Rogers School of Management to the northwest, and the office building known as Bell Trinity Square to the southeast. The original Eaton Centre construction plans called for the church to be demolished as well, but the parishioners successfully resisted and forced the mall's design to be changed. Since its construction, the city of Toronto has expanded so that the church now finds itself in the middle of Toronto's urban core. As a result, the church has tailored its ministry to the urban homeless and needy, and maintains a memorial outside the church doors which lists the names of homeless people who have died on the streets of Toronto. The church also has an active outreach to Toronto's LGBT community. Prior to acquiring its first building in 1985, the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto worshipped there, and the church vocally supported Anglican priest James Ferry after he was inhibited by the Anglican Church in 1991 when his sexual relationship with another man was discovered. Holy Trinity has also become an important venue for artistic events. The church participates as a venue in Toronto's annual Nuit Blanche, and presents a weekly series of classical, choral, and jazz concerts throughout the year, as well as a dramatization of the Christmas story every December since 1937. Due to the church's excellent acoustics, Canadian band Cowboy Junkies recorded their 1988 breakthrough album The Trinity Session at the church on November 27, 1987. In 2006, they returned to record a 20th anniversary edition of the album, Trinity Revisited.

It served as a companion UART chip for the widely popular 6502 microprocessor. Intended to implement RS-232, its specifications called for a maximum speed of 19,200 bits per second with its onboard baud-rate generator, or 125kbit/s using an external 16x clock. The 6551 was used in several computers of the 1970s and 1980s, including the Commodore PET and Commodore Plus/4. It was also used by Apple Computer on the Super Serial Card for their Apple II series, and by Radio Shack on the Deluxe RS-232 Program Pak for their Color Computer. Commodore International omitted the 6551 from the popular VIC-20, C64, and C128 home computers. Instead, these systems implemented a bit-banging UART via KERNAL routines. This RS-232 implementation was not reliable over 1200 bit/s (see errata comments in the 6526 article), forcing some programmers of terminal programs to write carefully calibrated custom serial routines. The popular terminal program NovaTerm was able to achieve 4800 bit/s on the C64, and DesTerm achieved 9600 bit/s on the C128. Several other terminal programs achieved 2400 bit/s. Novaterm 9.6 on a Commodore 64 or 128 can achieve a maximum rate of 9600 bit/s on the user port, using an EZ-232 interface, designed by Jim Brain. Several companies, including Dr. Evil Labs and Creative Micro Designs, marketed an add-on cartridge containing a 6551 and an industry-standard RS-232 port to allow the C64 and 128 to use high-speed modems from companies such as U.S. Robotics and Hayes Communications. The Dr. Evil and CMD cartridges pushed the 6551 to 38,400 baud and, with a faster-still clock crystal, some end users reported getting 115,200 bit/s from the 6551. The ADTPro file transfer program disables the baud rate generator in the 6551, allowing 115,200 bit/s transfers with an unmodified clock crystal.  Variants  The Rockwell 65C52 combines two CMOS 6551s on a chip.  Similar chips  The Motorola 6850 is a similar chip to the MOS Technology 6551. The 6850 is often used for MIDI.

Ross represented Edinburgh and Scottish Schools at U16 and U18 level before going on to represent Scotland at U19 and at U21 levels. He attended George Heriot's School and started his senior career with Heriots before joining Edinburgh when Scotland opted for regional rugby in 2000. The highlight of his early career was kicking the winning goal for Edinburgh Rugby against Biarritz Olympique in 1997 and beating England as part of the Scotland U19 squad in the same season. He played a pivotal role in Heriot's FP's second successive league title in 1999-00 and was duly rewarded with a professional contract with the Edinburgh Reivers.  Club career  Ross stayed with the Reivers from 2000 until 2002, when he moved to Leeds and stayed until 2006. He was voted Man of the Match when they won the Powergen Cup in 2005 beating Bath 20‚Äì12, a game in which Ross scored two penalties and two conversions. In 2006 he joined Castres for one season before moving on to Saracens, where he played for two seasons before joining London Welsh in 2009. In his debut season at Welsh he scored 30 points in 26 appearances, and helped the club reach the Championship semi-finals, where they lost to Bristol. Gordon endured an injury disrupted 2010/11 campaign, picking up a groin injury in the win over Bristol at Old Deer Park in October. He returned in January against the Ulster Ravens and helped Welsh reach a second consecutive Championship semi-final. He made 23 appearances, scoring 212 points, including a late match winning penalty to beat Bedford. Gordon made 31 appearances during the 2011/12 season and racked up 110 points in the Championship, including a 16-point haul as Welsh beat his former club Leeds at Headingley on the opening weekend of the season. His penalty with the last kick of the game gave Welsh an 18‚Äì16 win over London Scottish at Old Deer Park, while he landed a crucial drop goal in the first leg of the Championship final against the Cornish Pirates at Menneye Field. Ross has played Heineken Cup rugby for Leeds, Castres, Edinburgh and Saracens, making 40 appearances in Europe, scoring 263 points. International career A prodigious goal-kicker, Gordon Ross enjoyed a dream debut for Scotland with a record of 23 points in the 43‚Äì20 success against Tonga at Murrayfield in November 2001. Seven years later, during the Barclays Churchill Cup competition in North America, he set another record as the Scotland A team's top scorer. He passed Duncan Hodge's record of 126 points during a replacement appearance win against Argentina at Richardson Stadium in Kingston, Ontario. By the end of that 2008 tournament his tally in 16 Scotland A games was 140 points. They are the only players to have scored at least 100 points for Scotland A. Later that year Gordon took that record total to 150 points with five conversions in Scotland A's victory against Georgia at Firhill, Glasgow, and in February 2009 he extended his Scotland A appearances to 18 when he played as a replacement against Ireland A at the RDS, Dublin. A further A international appearance and seven points were added in the 22-all draw with Italy at McDiarmid Park, Perth, taking his points tally to 157. Gordon's first Test try was included in an 18-point haul in the 2003 RWC Countdown victory over Italy, also at Murrayfield, and he scored his first drop goal for Scotland in the 13‚Äì10 victory over Italy in the final match of the 2006 RBS 6 Nations. In 2002 his assurance and control were key factors in Scotland's Murrayfield win against South Africa. Earlier in the year he emerged as joint top scorer (36 points) on Scotland's tour of North America during which he played in all three midweek victories. Gordon reached his Scotland A century while captaining the team in victory against Italy A at McDiarmid Park, Perth, in February 2007. Gordon kicked 17 points on his debut for Scotland A as they accounted for their Welsh counterparts 42‚Äì20 in February 2001. His goal-kicking was to the fore in the next A victory, too ‚Äì the 33‚Äì13 success against Italy A in which he contributed 13 points. In February 2002 he kicked two goals from two attempts in quagmire conditions to ensure Scotland A opened their shadow Six Nations campaign with a 6‚Äì6 draw against their English counterparts. Better followed a fortnight later when his last-gasp conversion 20 metres from the right touchline earned the Scots a 30‚Äì29 victory over Italy A to which Ross contributed a total of 20 points, including a try. He had a full house in a haul of 18 points (try, penalty, two conversions and two drop goals) against Wales A at Wrexham in 2002. He played in seven A internationals in 2001 and 2002, and he returned to that level in the Perth match against Australia A in November 2006. He played in two wins in 2007 (against Italy A at McDiarmid Park and against the USA at Henley in the Barclays Churchill Cup competition) as well as two more in 2008 (v Italy A in Mogliano and Ireland A) before that year's Churchill Cup. During a time that the national team were lacking in depth at the number 10 position it is still a point of mystery to many Scotland fans as to why he never picked up further caps beyond the 25 he collected. A preference of Dan Parks by coaches Matt Williams & Frank Hadden and eventual emergence of a more running fly half in Phil Godman may have curtailed further call up opportunities. Additional achievements Gordon played golf for Scottish Schools with a handicap of two and also played cricket at district level.

A particular feature of his election program is a pro-Ukrainian choice in foreign policy, saying that entry to the European Union should not be a barrier to the development of relationships with all Commonwealth of Independent States countries as well as with Russia. During the election campaign, Kinakh publicly broke ties with government-backed candidate and then Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych by declaring that no criminal can hold the post of President of Ukraine. He later took an active part in the Orange Revolution on the side of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko (who was elected president). Kinakh was appointed First Vice Prime Minister in the first Tymoshenko Government Kinakh became Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine on September 27, 2005.

Intended as a tetralogy, it was left incomplete, with only three of the planned four volumes published. The three published novels revolve around Mathieu, a Socialist teacher of philosophy, and a group of his friends. The trilogy includes: L'√¢ge de raison (The Age of Reason), Le sursis (which is generally translated as The Reprieve but could cover a number of semantic fields from 'deferment' to 'amnesty'), and La mort dans l'√¢me (Troubled Sleep, originally translated by Gerard Hopkins as Iron in the Soul, Hamish Hamilton, 1950). The trilogy was to be followed by a fourth novel, La derni√®re chance (i.e. The Last Chance); however, Sartre would never finish it: two chapters were published in 1949 in Sartre's magazine Les Temps modernes under the title Dr√¥le d'amiti√©.Caute, D. Introduction to The Reprieve by Jean-Paul Sartre, Penguin Classics, 2001. The last part of The Last Chance was later reconstructed and published in 1981 (see section below). The novels were written largely in response to the events of World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, and express certain significant shifts in Sartre's philosophical position towards 'engagement' (commitment) in both life and literature, finding their resolution in the extended essay L'existentialisme est un humanisme (Existentialism is a Form of Humanism). Background Sartre's Paris on the Eve of War ‚Äì \\"Gaiety...Cafes\\". An engraving by Iain McNab. (Published in The New York Times in the book review of The Age of Reason, July 13, 1947) In April 1938, Sartre's first novel Nausea was published. Three months later in July, he wrote to Simone de Beauvoir, \\"I have all at once found the subject of my [next] novel, its proportions and its title... The subject is freedom.\\" Originally it was to be titled \\"Lucifer,\\" and written in two parts ‚Äì \\"La Revolte\\" and \\"Le Serment\\" (The Oath).Quoted in Sartre: A Biography by Ronald Hayman (Carroll & Graf, 1987), p. 133. In the autumn of 1938, Sartre began writing the novel that was to become The Age of Reason, and continued working on the novel on and off for the next year. In early September 1939, Sartre was called up into the French Army and was assigned to the meteorological unit. Except for some regular meteorological observations, this war work was not exacting, and Sartre had plenty of time to work on his novel, his war diaries, and numerous letters to friends. At one point Sartre produced seventy-three pages of the novel in thirteen days.Hayman, p. 153. By December 31, 1939, he had completed the novel, and immediately started a sequel, which he originally wanted to call September (referring to The Munich Agreement of September 1938), and which became titled The Reprieve.Annie Cohen-Solal, Sartre: A Life (Pantheon Books), p. 143. He finished writing The Reprieve in November 1943.See Chronology in Hayman, p. 494. However, he was constantly editing the manuscripts, and also turned them over to Simone de Beauvoir for critique. His writing in these novels was semi- autobiographical. His separation from his accustomed life in Paris and the leisure and structure of his war work led him to continued introspection during this period.Hayman, pp. 154‚Äì157. Mathieu was based upon himself, Ivich was based on Olga Kosakiewicz (a student of Simone de Beauvoir and friend of Sartre), Gomez was based on Fernando Gerassi, and Sarah on Stepha Advykowitch (both very close friends to Sartre and de Beauvoir), and Boris was based on his friend Jacques-Laurent Bost.Cohen-Solal, p. 254. Marcelle, perhaps loosely based on Simone de Beauvoir, was the character most removed from the real-life model.Hayman, p. 158. The Age of Reason and The Reprieve were published together after the war in September 1945. \\"Sartre was by now France's leading intellectual voice, and the novels, not least because they defined a critical period in French history, were received with great enthusiasm by the French public.\\"Gary Cox. Sartre and Fiction. Continuum Books, 2009, p. 100. However, some reviews were mixed. Louis Parrot writing for Les Lettres francaises said, \\"Jean-Paul Sartre has definitely taken his place among the greatest French writers of our day... His powerful talent has affirmed itself with rare brilliance.\\" Ga√©ton Picon writing for Confluences said, \\"If Sartre's ambition was to force the doors of literary history, he has succeeded.. Like all great novelists, he also enjoys the privilege of having a universe of his own.\\" However, Louis Beirnart, writing for Etudes said, \\"If books could smell, one would have to hold one's nose in front of Sartre's latest books... Sartre's objective is, very clearly, to show life through its excrement and lower the value of existence to the level of the gutter and the dump.\\"These three reviews were quoted in Cohen-Solal, p. 255. Orville Prescott, writing for The New York Times, mentioned \\"His Cast of Characters Dull\\".Orville Prescott, \\"Books of the Times,\\" New York Times, July 14, 1947, p. 19. Extracts of the third novel in the trilogy, Troubled Sleep, appeared in the journal Les Temps Modernes January and June 1949,See Chronology in Hayman, p. 496. and it was published in book form later that year. The reviews were not good. As for the reception, Sartre scholar Michel Contat says: Troubled Sleep \\"failed to provoke the anticipated and promised positive responses, as critics transferred their moral disappointment into an accusation that [Troubled Sleep] represented an exhaustion of Sartre's literary creativity. Although Sartre always said that he accorded no importance to the judgments of literary reviewers, his partial failure in their eyes intimidated him in the face of the fourth volume...\\"Michel Contat in his \\"General Introduction for Roads of Freedom,\\" in: Jean Paul Sartre, The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV, Continuum Books, 2009, p. 196. Consequently, Sartre was unable to complete the series.

The second volume, Le sursis (1945, The Reprieve), explores the ramifications of the appeasement pact that Great Britain and France signed with Nazi Germany in 1938. In the third book, La mort dans l'√¢me (1949; Troubled Sleep, published in Great Britain as Iron in the Soul), Delarue ends his indecisiveness by attempting to defend a village under attack from the Germans. Although he is apparently killed, Delarue expresses his ultimate freedom through his bravery.\\"From the article on Jean-Paul Sartre in Contemporary Literary Criticism, Gale, 1989, p. 372. Available online with library card, retrieved 7/24/2014. The second part of Troubled Sleep focuses on Mathieu's communist friend Brunet in the POW camp. Dr√¥le d'amiti√© (Strange Friendship) also focuses on Brunet, and his fellow prisoner Schneider, in the POW camp. In the final part, La derni√®re chance (The Last Chance), it is revealed that Mathieu was in fact not previously killed‚ÄîHe reappears in a stalag after two months in the hospital. Shifting viewpoints within the novels In L'√¢ge de raison, \\"the perspective changes from chapter to chapter throughout the account of a 48-hour period. In volume 2, Le Sursis, the time- span is a week, but the viewpoint shifts more rapidly, moving sometimes within a single phrase from one character's perspective to another's... The lack of punctuation, the juxtaposition of perspectives, and the intensity created by the single focus of a multiplicity of characters work together to convey the common humanity and intersubjective experience of the French on the verge of war... Volume 3, La mort dans l'√¢me, reverts to a slower pace of perspectival change.\\"Quotation taken from the article on \\"Chemins de la libert√©, Les\\" in The New Oxford Companion to Literature in French, ed. by Peter France. Oxford, 1995, pages 159‚Äì160. As for the experimental style of The Reprieve, Sartre wrote in 1945: :: \\"I tried to take advantage of the experiments in technique that certain writers of simultaneity, like Dos Passos and Virginia Woolf, have undertaken. I took up their question at the very point where they had let it lie, and I tried to uncover something new along this path. The reader will say whether or not I've succeeded.\\"Chapter 3 entitled \\"Please Insert 1: 1945, Jean Paul Sartre,\\" in The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV, by Jean-Paul Sartre, translated by Craig Vasey. Continuum Books, 2009, p. 23. Of the first two books in the series, Sartre once said: ::\\"My intention was to write a novel about freedom. I wanted to retrace the path followed by some people and social groups between 1938 and 1944... I decided to tell The Age of Reason in an ordinary way, by simply showing the structured relationships that link a few individuals. But then come the days of September 1938, and all the barriers collapse... In The Reprieve we'll find again all the characters of The Age of Reason, but now they are lost in a crowd.\\"Quoted in Cohen-Solal, p. 254. Interpretation Overall, \\"the Roads to Freedom as a trilogy reflects many of Sartre's best-known existentialist concepts, including bad faith, or self- deception, the acknowledgment of freedom that comes with both anguish and personal responsibility for one's actions, and how those actions embody the personal and social morality that one promotes.\\"Article by Tara J. Johnson on \\"The Roads to Freedom\\" in The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel, 1900 to the Present, ed. by Michael D. Sollars, p. 671. In his book Sartre and Fiction, Gary Cox discusses the implications of the Roads to Freedom series:Gary Cox. Sartre and Fiction. Continuum Books, 2009. Except where noted, quotes are taken from: pages 99‚Äì101. ::The Age of Reason... grew alongside Being and Nothingness for several years and echoes many of its central themes, particularly the themes of freedom, responsibility and being- for-others... ::It was not to the war that Sartre turned for inspiration for the first volume of his trilogy, but to prewar Paris of the summer of 1938.... The Age of Reason is not nostalgic about the years between the wars. Rather it casts a detached and objective eye on a group of largely pathetic, emotionally immature characters who are too self-absorbed to really notice or care about the gathering clouds of war that will soon change their narrow little lives beyond recognition. With the coming of war Sartre began to change from a thinker preoccupied with the personal into a very political animal.... ::The Reprieve was written while the Germans occupied Paris ... It covers the eight days from 23 to 30 September leading up to the controversial Munich Agreement... With The Reprieve politics and history enter the trilogy with a vengeance, although events are not unfolded in the form of an abstract historical account but via myriad personal perspectives. ::Iron in the Soul (a.k.a. Troubled Sleep) is set in June 1940, 21 months after the events of The Reprieve. The central historical theme of the novel is the defeat of France by the Germans, and certainly a major source of inspiration for the novel was Sartre's capture and imprisonment by German forces in June 1940.... Mathieu makes a brief fifteen-minute stand against the Nazis ... that is all but futile in military terms, but for him it is an uncompromising and decisive act that is the ultimate affirmation of his freedom ... Here Mathieu achieves authenticity...Cox, Sartre and Fiction, p. 125. ::The final 120 pages of the novel shift the focus to the communist Brunet in the POW camp. Brunet sees the game of French captives and German captors as another symptom of the evils of capitalism and nationalism, evils that will continue when this particular war is over unless ordinary people of whatever nationality can win the class struggle. The unfinished fourth volume, The Last Chance In 1981 a text of La derni√®re chance was published in French with Sartre's complete works of fiction in the Pl√©ide edition. George H. Bauer and Michel Contat had painstakingly reconstructed the intended novel from Sartre's \\"completely unorganized manuscript pages.\\"Jean Paul Sartre. The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV. Continuum Books, 2009, p. 12. In their \\"Critical Note on The Last Chance,\\" the authors note: \\"Let us also add that Sartre had come to be aware of the work we were doing on his drafts, and that he allowed it.\\"The Last Chance, p. 204. In 2009, Craig Vasey translated and published this work into English. Vasey's edition, titled The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV, includes two parts: 1) Strange Friendship (Dr√¥le d'amiti√©) ‚Äì the two chapters which were previously published in 1949 in Sartre's magazine Les Temps modernes; and 2) The Last Chance (La derni√®re chance) ‚Äì the text reconstructed by Bauer and Contat from Sartre's notes. This is the first time that these two parts have been available in English. Why Sartre did not finish the series Sartre's biographer Ronald Hayman theorized that one reason Sartre did not finish the Roads to Freedom series was that Sartre \\"deeply disliked bringing anything to a conclusion.\\"Hayman, p. 17. Hayman pointed out that although Sartre \\"managed to complete nine original plays, seven short stories, and several screenplays, nearly all his other major projects in literature and philosophy were abandoned.\\" These included the planned sequels to Nausea, Being and Nothingness, and Critique of Dialectical Reason, and \\"other uncompleted projects including the autobiography, the enormous biography of Flaubert, La Psych√© (a phenomenological psychology), a book on Mallarm√©, one on Tintoretto,\\" etc. As for the Roads to Liberty, Sartre \\"had relatively little difficulty in completing the first three volumes: nothing needed to be concluded. He wrote 223 pages of the last volume, La derniere chance, and he did not give up hope of finishing it until nine years after publishing the third volume in the series.\\"Hayman, p. 18. According to Hayman, one reason for Sartre's unfinished projects was his restlessness: when Sartre \\"worked at long-term projects, it was tarnished by ambivalence. Other work would be clamoring for his time, and simultaneously he would feel guilty about enjoying words instead of taking action.\\"Hayman, p. 19. Simone de Beauvoir is quoted as saying, \\"Without having abandoned the idea of a fourth volume, he always found work that needed his attention more.\\"Simone de Beauvoir, Force of Circumstance, p. 196. Quoted by Michel Contat in his \\"General Introduction for Roads of Freedom,\\" in: Jean Paul Sartre, The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV, Continuum Books, 2009, p. 193. For another possible interpretation, Hayman goes on to quote the writer Michael Scriven, who said that Sartre was \\"shattering the myth of the coherently finished text, the myth that the contradictions that gave rise to the work have been resolved by an apparently cohesive textual narrative.\\"Hayman, p. 18 ‚Äì quoting Michael Scriven. Sartre's Existential Biographies. London, 1984, p. 6. Michel Contat, in his \\"General Introduction for Roads of Freedom,\\" points out that Sartre was no longer in the right frame of mind. His experience had become \\"extremely restricted and particularized. It became the experience of a man of letters, a celebrity intellectual, who, apart from his old circle of friends, almost only encounters people like himself, even when he goes abroad.\\" Also, the reviews of the last novel in the series, Troubled Sleep, had not been good. Contat further suggests that \\"it is in developing the idea, near the end of 1953, of an autobiography that Sartre decides ‚Äì or rather that the decision takes place in him ‚Äì to leave his novel where it is, for this new project represents a way out of the dead-end in which he finds himself with the novel.\\"Michel Contat in his \\"General Introduction for Roads of Freedom,\\" in: Jean Paul Sartre, The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV, Continuum Books, 2009, p. 193. In an interview in 1973 concerning The Roads to Freedom, Sartre revealed at least one of the reasons he discontinued the series: :What is fundamentally false about a novel in which one constructs a character based on oneself is precisely that he is not really you. The differences you put into him, and which seem of no decisive significance at the outset, end up throwing him into falseness. In The Age of Reason, I gave Mathieu everything of mine‚ÄîI don't mean the facts of life, but his character‚Äîexcept the essential thing, which is that I lived in order to write. There is something radically false in an autobiographical novel, namely that it's straddling: it is neither completely a novel, nor completely an autobiography. But that's something I did not want to see at the time because I did not want to abandon the novel, and I could not write without making use of my own life.Michel Contat, \\"General Introduction for Roads of Freedom,\\" in: Jean Paul Sartre, The Last Chance: Roads of Freedom IV, Continuum Books, 2009, p. 195 (reprinting an excerpt from an unpublished 1973 interview). Adaptation The novel series was adapted into a thirteen-part television serial by David Turner for the BBC in 1970, with Michael Bryant as Mathieu and directed by James Cellan Jones. The adaptation was nominated for several BAFTA awards for 1970.BAFTA Television Nominations for 1970. The entire series was screened at the British Film Institute over the weekend of 12‚Äì13 May 2012, attended by the director and several surviving cast members.BFI Press Release However, the series has not been broadcast on television since 1976, and is not available on video, DVD, online or from the BBC Store. The reasons for the BBC's reluctance to make the series available remain unclear despite calls from director James Cellan and members of the public. An online petition has been organised urging the BBC to \\"arrange as soon as practicable for the showing on one of its channels the adaption of Jean Paul Sartre's \\"The Roads to Freedom\\" and for its world-wide distribution on DVD.\\" References External links * Novel sequences Novels by Jean-Paul Sartre BBC television dramas ","title":"The Roads to Freedom"},{"id":"1210672","text":"Serhiy Vasyl πovych Komisarenko (; , Sergey Vasilyovich Komissarenko), born July 9, 1943 in Ufa, Bashkortostan, USSR is a Ukrainian scientist, politician, and diplomat.

The film was directed by Ranald MacDougall and produced by Jerry Wald, and the screenplay by MacDougall was based upon the novel The Queen Bee, by Edna L. Lee. The film tells the story about a Southern family dominated by a ruthless woman and the havoc her threats and intimidation cause to those around her. Plot Eva Phillips (Joan Crawford) dominates her Georgia mansion and her husband Avery (Barry Sullivan), an alcoholic mill owner who hates his wife. A cousin, Jennifer Stewart (Lucy Marlow), is pressured into moving in with the family, and she watches in horror as Eva maneuvers to prevent the marriage of Avery's sister Carol (Betsy Palmer) to Judson Prentiss (John Ireland). Carol tells Jennifer to watch out for Eva, and that she read a book about bees and feels that Eva is like a queen bee who stings all her competitors to death. Jennifer refuses to believe such bad sentiments about Eva, and eventually becomes the putative personal assistant to Eva. That same night, Eva and Jud have a meeting in a darkened room where he tells her that their relationship and anything they had together was over because he is marrying Carol. Eva rejects this and begins to kiss him, but Judson stops kissing her after a few seconds once he realizes that he is falling back into her trap. Meanwhile, Jennifer witnesses this rendezvous from the top of the staircase and is shocked. Jud turns the light on and tells Eva that he is serious, and she warns him that he will ultimately be sorry for refusing her. When Carol and Jud's engagement is announced to Eva, Eva strongly hints at her former affair with Jud, and Carol commits suicide by hanging herself in the barn. Jennifer and Avery are drawn together and share a furtive kiss when he tells her that he is aware of Eva and Jud's past. Eva senses the developing relationship and increases her malevolent actions, and tells Avery to not interact with Jennifer any longer. When he refuses, she threatens a scandalous divorce in the press. Meanwhile, Jud, still guilty over Carol's death, leaves the house for a few weeks, but comes back one day for work. He finds out from Jennifer that it was really Eva who told Carol about his earlier relationship with Eva, not Avery as he had assumed. Now, for different reasons, both men are determined to avenge it. Avery changes his attitude completely, and acts as though he is in love with Eva. She changes her attitude and says that she is done being manipulative because her husband finally loves her. However, Jud sees through the charade and confronts Avery that his true motives for being nice to Eva is so that she will trust him enough so that he can kill her. Jud preempts his plan on the night Avery intends to commit murder-suicide and takes Eva driving. When Eva discerns that he wants her dead, she frantically attacks him, resulting in a crash over a cliff, killing them both. Now, Jennifer and Avery are free to love each other.

Martel began her professional wrestling career in the Mid South after training in Columbia, South Carolina. She joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the mid-1980s and held its AWA World Women's Championship three times. In the late 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where she held the WWF Women's Championship. Also in the WWF, Martel continued to act as a manager to wrestlers such as Randy Savage, Ted DiBiase, and Shawn Michaels. She appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1990s. In the latter, Martel acted as the manager for the tag team Harlem Heat. After leaving WCW, she made few wrestling related appearances until her death in 2007. She also appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in September 2006 as a manager for Bobby Roode which ended up being her last televised wrestling appearance. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1974‚Äì1985)= Martel was first introduced to professional wrestling as a child, when her mother took her and her sister to shows in Mississippi. In 1974, Martel approached Grizzly Smith for advice on becoming a wrestler, but he questioned her conviction and told her to come back to him in five years when she was an adult. She eventually married her second husband and gave birth to a son named Jared, but she soon divorced her husband. During this time, she again became interested in becoming a professional wrestler and sought training from \\"Mr. Personality\\" Butch Moore in Memphis, Tennessee. She started wrestling as Sherri Martine, but decided she needed more training. She continued to train at The Fabulous Moolah's school, where Moolah changed her name to Sherri Martel and sent her to wrestle in Japan in 1981. Moolah claims that Martel frequented night clubs and liked to party, which resulted in Moolah kicking her out of the school. After leaving the school, she traveled back to Tennessee. In Memphis, she was managed by Jim Cornette. During a mixed battle royal, Martel suffered an injury that removed her from wrestling temporarily. She then worked as both a wrestler and manager for Pat Rose and Tom Prichard. =American Wrestling Association (1985-1987)= After recovering, Larry Zbyszko helped her join the American Wrestling Association (AWA). She eventually debuted in the AWA and, on September 28, 1985, at SuperClash in Chicago, she defeated Candi Devine for the AWA World Women's Championship.Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, 136‚Äì138. She traded the belt with Devine, and on June 28, 1986, at \\"Battle by the Bay,\\" Martel defeated Devine to win the AWA World Women's Championship for a third and final time. Martel, however, only held the title briefly before vacating it. During this time, in addition to wrestling, Martel acted as the manager for the team of \\"Playboy\\" Buddy Rose and \\"Pretty Boy\\" Doug Somers, whom she managed to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Rose and Somers then engaged in a lengthy feud with The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty),Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak and Triumph, p. 97. who defeated Rose and Somers for the tag team title on January 27, 1987, in St. Paul, Minnesota. =World Wrestling Federation (1987‚Äì1993)= Debut & Women's Champion (1987-1988) After former AWA wrestler Jesse Ventura referred her to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), she debuted on July 24, 1987, defeating The Fabulous Moolah for the WWF Women's Championship.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 196‚Äì197. Renaming herself Sensational Sherri, she reigned as WWF Women's Champion for fifteen months before losing it to Rockin' Robin on October 8, 1988, in Paris, France. At the Survivor Series in 1987, Martel's team consisting of Martel, Women's World Tag Team Champions The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin), Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team consisting of Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki).Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, 164. When the WWF phased out its women's division in 1990, Martel remained with the company and turned her attention to managing male wrestlers. Concurrent with her reign as WWF Women's Champion, Martel made several appearances in costume as \\"Peggy Sue,\\" the girlfriend of The Honky Tonk Man, who was in the midst of a run as Intercontinental Champion. Her primary role was to irritate Honky's opponents‚Äînamely, Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage and Brutus \\"the Barber\\" Beefcake‚Äîand interfere in his matches. Managing Randy Savage and Ted DiBiase (1989-1992) Sherri managed several wrestlers in WWF, including Ted DiBiase during his time as Million Dollar Champion After WrestleMania V, Martel confronted Miss Elizabeth, manager of newly-dethroned former WWF World champion Randy Savage, during an interview, leading to a confrontation between the two in which Savage fired Miss Elizabeth and repeatedly threatened to hit her.Dethroned and demoralised!

At SummerSlam, Hogan and Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake defeated the team of Savage and Zeus.Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, 192. After the match, Miss Elizabeth knocked out Martel with Martel's purse, and she, Hogan, and Beefcake cut Martel's hair. At WrestleMania VI in 1990, Martel and Savage lost a mixed tag- team match against Sapphire and Dusty Rhodes after Miss Elizabeth, who was in the corner of Sapphire and Rhodes, interfered and shoved Martel. During that same year, Martel and Savage appeared on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous with Robin Leach. During a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden, The Ultimate Warrior pulled off an escaping Martel's miniskirt to reveal matching black garter belts and lace underpants. Practically in tears, Martel raced back to the locker room. At WrestleMania VII, Savage lost a \\"retirement match\\" against The Ultimate Warrior, in which the loser would be forced (Kayfabe) to retire. After Savage lost the match, an irate Martel attacked Savage but was thrown from the ring by Miss Elizabeth, who had been watching from the audience. Later on the WM7 card after she and Savage parted ways following the career match, Martel came to the ring to help \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase in his assault on an injured Rowdy Roddy Piper, following which she managed DiBiase until 1992. Pairing and feuding with Shawn Michaels (1992-1993) Subsequently, Martel began managing Shawn Michaels after Pat Patterson convinced Michaels to participate in the storyline.Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak and Triumph, p. 159. She also sang Michaels' theme song called \\"Sexy Boy\\". As part of his gimmick, Michaels would admire himself in a full- length mirror before his matches.Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak and Triumph, pp. 166‚Äì167. In 1992, before a match, his former partner Marty Jannetty grabbed the mirror and attempted to hit Michaels with it, but Michaels pulled Martel in front of him. After being hit with the mirror, she was absent from television until the Royal Rumble in January 1993. At the Rumble, she was in a neutral corner for the match between Michaels and Jannetty but eventually turned on Michaels during the match. Backstage, Michaels confronted her and Jannetty came to her rescue. The storyline, however, was cut short as Jannetty was released from the company in the midst of the feud. Martel spent the remainder of the year aligned with Tatanka, who aided her in her feud with Luna Vachon and Bam Bam Bigelow. She was released from the World Wrestling Federation during the summer. =USWA (1993)= Towards the end of her time in the WWF, Martel participated in a WWF invasion angle in the USWA, reuniting with Savage. Martel would suffer a similar embarrassment to that which she had suffered at the hands of Warrior when she ran in the ring to aid Savage in a steel cage match in Memphis against his old enemy in the area, Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler, but after accidentally knocking Savage from the ring, she had her dress yanked off by Lawler as she climbed the cage to escape. =Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1993)= After her WWF release, Martel had a brief spell in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, siding with Tracy Smothers in a feud with Tammy Sytch, Brian Lee, as well as several intergender matches with Jim Cornette. =Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1994)= She began working in Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1993, managing Shane Douglas. Sherri turned on Douglas in a tag match with Brian Pillman, costing Douglas the match on behalf of Ric Flair. At November to Remember on November 13, Martel faced Malia Hosaka in a match. =World Championship Wrestling (1994-1997)= Managing with Ric Flair (1994) Martel signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994. The original plan for her was to manage Kevin and Dave Sullivan against Missy Hyatt and The Nasty Boys, but after Hyatt was fired in February 1994, the proposed rivalry went on with no managers for either team. Martel made her debut on the April 23 edition of WCW Saturday Night, under the name Sensuous Sherri. In an interview with Gene Okerlund, she said her goal was to find a man that can bring her the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. She was at ringside during at Slamboree on May 22, during the WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between Ric Flair and Barry Windham. On June 24, a title unification match took place at the Clash of the Champions XXVII between WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair and the WCW International World Heavyweight Champion Sting. Although she revealed in the beginning of the match she sided with Sting (including wearing his signature face paint), it turned out to be a double cross, as she sided with Flair, who won the match and unified the titles, double-teaming Sting, until the newly signed Hulk Hogan made the save. At Bash at the Beach, Martel tried to help Flair to defeat Hogan in a match by giving him brass knuckles but failed. At the feud's climactic battle, a steel cage match at Halloween Havoc, Martel climbed the cage to aid Flair and in the process had her dress pulled off by Jimmy Hart, Hogan's manager, leaving her dangling from the cage in black lingerie. Managing with Harlem Heat and departure (1994-1997) Next, Martel began managing Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) using the name Sister Sherri. She managed the team to seven WCW World Tag Team Championship reigns. In late 1994 (while still managing Harlem Heat in WCW), Martel made a return appearance in ECW managing Shane Douglas and Brian Pillman against Ron Simmons and 2 Cold Scorpio. Back in WCW, Martel had a brief on-screen romance with Col. Robert Parker until October 1996 when Harlem Heat fired him and Martel had a match with him at World War 3 in November. She continued to manage Harlem Heat until she got fired from the group on the July 7, 1997 edition of Nitro.Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, 208. =Later career (1999‚Äì2006)= Early in 1999, Martel competed in a mixed-tag team match for the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation's Heavyweight Championship, a title held predominately by men. Missy Hyatt pinned Martel to win the title. In October 1999, she appeared on the Heroes of Wrestling pay-per-view managing Greg Valentine in a match against George Steele. Also in 1999, she was awarded the AWA Superstars Women's Championship. In 2000, she made three wrestling television appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The first was at the Souled Out 2000 pay-per-view event, watching at ringside along with other superstars, the Chris Benoit vs. Sid Vicious matchup for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The second was on the January 19, 2000 edition of WCW Thunder where she had a match with Madusa, which she lost. In her third and final appearance in World Championship Wrestling, she had a match with Mona, which she also lost. In 2005, she took part in a World Wrestling Entertainment (formerly the WWF) storyline with Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle shortly before WrestleMania 21. She made a return to SmackDown!, singing a parody of Michaels' theme song with Angle. She was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Ted DiBiase in April 2006. Later that year, she worked for TNA Wrestling, taping a backstage vignette trying to offer her managerial services to \\"free agent\\" Bobby Roode that aired on the September 21, 2006 TNA Impact!; it was her last wrestling television appearance. Personal life By 2003, she and her husband Robert Schrull lived in Tennessee, where she helped him renovate homes. She was married and divorced at least twice during her life. She had one son. =Death= On June 15, 2007, Martel died at her mother's residence in McCalla, Alabama, near Birmingham. She was 49 years old. On September 11, 2007, homicide investigators in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, released the toxicology report stating that she died of an overdose with multiple drugs in her system, including high amounts of oxycodone. She was cremated after her death.

Best known as members of punk band Frenzal Rhomb, they performed occasional late-night shifts on Triple J until 2004. They temporarily replaced Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for six weeks in late 2004 while The Chaser Decides covered the federal election. On 26 November 2004, Jay and the Doctor were announced as the hosts of the Breakfast Show in 2005. The announcement was highly built up by incumbent hosts Adam & Wil. Prior to their employment at the station, their music was banned for a time by Triple J after Frenzal Rhomb criticised the station on air for playing the \\"same 40 songs\\".http://www.smh.com.au/news/TV-- Radio/Early-morning-wakeup-call/2005/01/28/1106850095448.html Myf Warhurst joined Jay and the Doctor on breakfast in January 2007, to form Myf, Jay and the Doctor. Warhurst announced on 10 October 2007 that she would leave Triple J and co-host a new show with comedian Peter Helliar for Triple M Melbourne. Jason \\"Jay\\" Whalley's last broadcast was on Friday, 23 November 2007. The Doctor continued to host the weekday breakfast shift program with Robbie Buck and Marieke Hardy Until the end of 2009. He then hosted the afternoon drive program from 3-5:30pm weekdays replacing Scott Dooley until late 2014. Segments Some of their on-air antics include the following segments: * Happy Monday - Jay and The Doctor try to brighten up Monday mornings by playing an infuriating song repeatedly. On 29 August 2005, they initiated \\"The Happiest Monday Ever\\" prior to which they encouraged listeners to falsely appear sick in order to take the day off work and spend the morning listening to them broadcast from Jason's bed and other parts of his house. Special guests included \\"The Iron Deficient Chef\\" Suzy Spoon preparing a vegan breakfast. * Agony Cox - An agony aunt section featuring Andrew Cox of the popular Melbourne indie band The Fauves, who helps give advice to selected listeners that call in with a personal problem that needs addressing. * Dreamweaver- Listeners call up and describe recent dreams to Jason and he interprets them. Jason often parodies cold reading. At some point the segment became speedweaver, where Jason gives a short one or two sentence response before quickly moving onto the next caller. Then it became screamweaver, where Jason screams his response. * The Friday F***wit- Jay and the doctor nominate a person, feeling, object or incident in the news that week who they think deserves particular recognition. To play up the humour, it is not always obvious and the reasoning may be quite strange. The award can not be received twice by the same person. * Under the weather sessions- A well-known musician will teach Jay and the Doctor how to play one of their songs. Originally this was to play in the background of one of the weather readings, hence the name. Now the weather is often sung by the guest. Skits Like several other Triple J programs with comedic content, Jay and the Doctor produce short skits that are played during their program as well as at other times of day. =Series= * Battalion 666- An increasingly bizarre radio serial about \\"HMS Beelzebub\\", a fictitious ship of the Royal Navy staffed entirely of satanists. Most of the crew are also well-known celebrities. Their dialogue is made up of either (bad) impersonations from Jay or the Doctor (some examples are New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, Corey Taylor from Slipknot, The Chemical Brothers and even fellow Triple J hosts John Safran and sometimes, Craig Reucassel), or repetitive samples of the celebrity's voice (some examples are Russell Crowe/\\"Maximus\\" and Billy Corgan and Jacki O stunt bum - reference to a rival broadcaster Jackie \\"O\\" (O'Neil)). The only regular character that is not a famous celebrity is \\"The Cook\\". Jay and the Doctor also appeared as themselves in the episode \\"Did I Mention We Won A Logie?\\". The series originated from the story that the Royal Navy would allow practising satanist crew members on board its ships and first aired during Jay and the Doctor's temporary Saturday afternoon program. * Space Goat- A serial involving a goat in outer space. Parodies early-era sci-fi radio serials, by having a large starting and ending narration, with the 'actual' episode consisting of a single audio clip of a goat, roughly a second long. The goat sound never changes. * Time Maniac- A serial involving an adventurer (played by fellow Triple J presenter Robbie Buck) who, due to a scientific mishap, perpetually travels to different time periods every five seconds. Every episode involves Time Maniac arriving at a turning point in history, but being thrown back through time just as he tries to mention future events. * 7:30 Resort- A send- up of typically biased \\"on-the-scene\\" news reporting. This involves head anchor \\"Jason Jay\\" Whalley delivering the headlines poolside at a tropical resort, while on-the-scene reporter \\"Radios\\" The Doctor becomes involved with the situation in a comic manner. * Musical Challenge- Claiming that they themselves prove that musicians should not talk, Jay and the Doctor propose an alternative method for interviewing musicians; by having them respond with their instruments. * Gamblers Anonymous Help Line- A parody of a gamblers help line. Jason bullies the desperate callers into continuing gambling to win their money back. * Flack- A parody of Triple J's current affairs program, Hack. * Steve Tankerfield's Trafficking Report- A parody of traffic reports given from a helicopter, but reporting on drug trafficking. * Swamp Donkey- A serial spun off from Space Goat that allows listeners to submit their own scripts using a predefined sound. =One-offs= * Interview and Interrogation - Following allegations by Mamdouh Habib of mistreatment while he was imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, certain government ministers and intelligence officials were contradicting each other over whether he was interviewed or interrogated. Jay and the Doctor apply the same level of ambiguity to interviewing musical guests. * Caring Through Swearing - Jay and the Doctor claim it is better to swear at a child than to hit them. * Asia vs The rest of the world - Following the \\"Asia vs The rest of the world\\" charity cricket match, Jay and the Doctor propose a follow-up; \\"Asia vs The rest of the world: The War!\\" In the interest of humanity and charity. * Tsuna-you Tsuna-me - A song by Jay and the Doctor about donations made to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, claiming we do it \\"so we can feel good about ourselves\\". This song caused some controversy, at least on conservative talk- back radio stations . References External links * Jay and the Doctor program page on the ABC site.

Purpose of closures Many containers and packages require a means of closing. It can be a separate device or seal or sometimes an integral latch or lock. Depending on the contents and container, closures have several functions: * Keep the container closed and the contents contained for the specified shelf life until time of opening * Provide a barrier to dirt, oxygen, moisture, etc. Control of permeation is critical to many types of products: foods, chemicals, etc. * Keep the product secure from undesired premature opening * Provide a means of reclosing or reusing the container * Assist in dispensing and use of product * Allow reasonable ease to open the container by the intended user. Difficult to open containers may cause wrap rage. The force or torque required to open a closure is an important consideration for packaging engineers. Many types of packaging with their closures are regulated for strength, safety, security, communication, recycling, and environmental requirements plus many others. Types of closures Closures need a means of attaching to the container with sufficient security. Threads, lugs, hinges, locks, adhesives, etc. are used. Many closures need to have the ability to adjust to slight manufacturing variation in the container and the closure structure. Some closures are made of flexible material such as cork, rubber, or plastic foam. Often an o-ring or a closure liner (gasket made of pulp or foam cap liner) is used. Linerless closures often use a deformable plastic rim or structure to maintain the seal. Secondary seals are common with sensitive products that may deteriorate or where extra security is needed. Foil or plastic innerseals are used on some bottles, Heat sealed lidding films are used on some tubs. External shrink bands, labels, and tapes are sometimes used outside the primary closure structure. Additionally, many closures feature ventilation to prevent bloating, collapse or explosion due to unequalized pressure during processing or storage. Venting technologies utilize common materials such as PTFE, PP, etc. These elements are preferred due to their ability to withstand temperatures of 260¬∞C and water intrusion pressure levels of 770 mbar. =Screw top= right A screw closure is a mechanical device which is screwed on and off of a threaded \\"finish\\" on a container. Either continuous threads (C-T) or lugs are used. Metal caps can be either preformed or in some instances, rolled on after application. Plastic caps may use several types of molded polymer. Some screw tops have multiple pieces. For example, a mason jar often has a lid with a built in rubbery seal and a separate threaded ring or band. =Crown cap= Crown caps Beverage bottles are frequently closed with crown beverage caps. These are shallow metal caps that are crimped into locking position around the head of the bottle. =Snap on= Some closures snap on. For opening, the top is designed to pry off or, break off, or have a built in dispenser. =Friction fit= Some containers have a loose lid for a closure. Laboratory glassware often has ground glass joints that allow the pieces to be fitted together easily. An Interference fit or friction fit requires some force to close and open, providing additional security. Paint cans often have a friction fit plug. =Tamper-evident= Resistance to tampering is required for some types of products. Container closures can be one of several layers of packaging to deter tampering and to provide evidence of attempts at tampering. *Sometimes tamper resistance is obtained by a tamper-evident band; separate or integral with the closure. =Dispensing= A wide variety of convenience dispensing features can be built into closures. Spray bottles and cans with aerosol spray (valves, actuator) have special closure requirements. Pour spouts, triggers, sprayer cap, measuring attachments, sifting devices, etc. are common caps. =Spray Bottle= A spray bottle is a bottle that can dispense, squirt, spray or mist fluids. A common use for spray bottles is dispensing cool cleaners, cosmetics, and chemical specialties. =Child-resistant= Child-resistant packaging or C-R packaging has special closures designed to reduce the risk of children ingesting dangerous items. This is often accomplished by the use of a special safety cap. It is required by regulation for prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, pesticides, and household chemicals.

The narrow necks of ancient amphora were closed with a plug of cork, wood, or ceramic and sealed with mortar. Wooden Barrels often had bungholes closed by cork or wood bungs. Some early tinplate cans were made with threaded necks for screw top closures. Beverage bottles started using the Hutter Stopper in 1893. This involved a porcelain plug fitted with a rubber washer, which was then forced down into the lip of the bottle. This technique only works with carbonated beverages. The Hutter Stopper became standard in beer bottling in the late 1890s / early 1900s. Bail closures on bottles were invented by Henry William Putnam in 1859. These involved heavy wire bail attached to a bottle's neck that swung over the cork to hold it in. The world's first modern bottle cap, the crown cork, was invented by William Painter in 1890 in Baltimore. The screw cap using rust resistant aluminum was first used in prescription drug bottling in the 1920s. Molded urea based bottle caps were first introduced in the early 1900s. A history of accidents involving children opening household packaging and ingesting the contents led the US Congress to pass the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.

Frenzal Rhomb had formed in Sydney in 1992 with mainstay Jason Whalley on lead vocals. In November 1996 the group issued a CD EP, Punch in the Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the United States supporting less than jake with Blink-182 opening. In September 1997, the band released their third album, Meet the Family. It was their first to be certified gold by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The next Frenzal Rhomb LP, A Man's Not a Camel was released in March 1999 and was supported by a nationwide tour. It remains their highest placed album to date, reaching No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It spawned their highest charting single, \\"You Are Not My Friend\\", which reached No. 48. The song was co-written by McDougall with fellow band members Whalley, Lex Feltham and Gordy Forman. In April 2003 the band released Sans Souci, followed by Forever Malcolm Young in 2006. During 2003 McDougall organised Rock Against Howard, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard's government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election, when Howard's coalition was re-elected. Also that year, McDougall and Whalley formed a side-project, Self Righteous Brothers, as an alternative rock group and issued the album, Love Songs for the Wrong at Heart on Shock Records.

Schmeling took the first match by a knockout in round 12 but in the second match, Louis won with a knockout in the first round. Although these champions met to create a pugilistic spectacle remarkable on its own terms, the two fights came to embody the broader political and social conflict of the time. As the most significant African American athlete of his age and the most successful black fighter since Jack Johnson, Louis was a focal point for African American pride in the 1930s. Moreover, as a contest between representatives of the United States and Nazi Germany during the 1930s, the fights came to symbolize the struggle between democracy and nazism. Louis' performance in the bouts made him one of the first true African-American national heroes in the United States. Prelude to first fight Joe Louis was born in Alabama, but lived much of his early years in Detroit. As a successful African American professional in the northern part of the country, Louis was seen by many other Americans as a symbol of the liberated black man. Since becoming a professional heavyweight, Louis amassed a record of 24‚Äì0 and was considered invincible heading into his first bout with Schmeling in 1936. Louis' celebrity was particularly important for African Americans of the era, who were not only suffering economically along with the rest of the country, but also were the targets of significant racially motivated violence, particularly in Southern states by members of the Ku Klux Klan. By the time of the Louis- Schmeling match, Schmeling was thought of as the final stepping stone to Louis' eventual title bid. Max Schmeling, on the other hand, was born in Germany, and he had become the first world heavyweight champion to win the title by a disqualification in 1930, against Jack Sharkey, another American. One year later, Schmeling retained his title by a Round 15 knockout against William Stribling. Later Schmeling lost the title in a rematch with Sharkey by a very controversial decision in 1932. As a result, Schmeling was well known to American boxing fans, and was still considered the No. 2 contender for James Braddock's heavyweight title in 1936. Nevertheless, many boxing fans considered Schmeling, 30 years old by the time of his first match with Louis, to be on the decline and not a serious challenge for the Brown Bomber. Perhaps as a result, Louis took training for the Schmeling fight none too seriously. Louis' training retreat was at Lakewood, New Jersey, where Louis was introduced to the game of golf ‚Äì later to become a lifelong passion. Louis spent significant time on the golf course rather than training.Vitale, p. 16. Conversely, Schmeling prepared intently for the bout. Schmeling had thoroughly studied Louis's style, and believed he had found a weakness: Louis's habit of dropping his left hand low after a jab.Vitale, p. 14. Although the political aspect of the first Louis-Schmeling bout would later be dwarfed by the crucible of the later 1938 rematch, brewing political sentiment would inevitably attach itself to the fight. Adolf Hitler had become chancellor of Germany three years previously and, although the United States and Germany were not yet political or military enemies, there was some tension building among the two countries as the Nazi Party began asserting its pro-Aryan, anti- Jewish ideology. Schmeling's Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, set up Schmeling's training at a Jewish resort in the Catskills, hoping it would help mollify Jewish fight fans. First fight Louis vs. Schmeling, 1936 The first fight between Louis and Schmeling took place on June 19, 1936, at the famous Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York. The referee was the legendary Arthur Donovan, and the stadium's seats were sold out. The bout was scheduled for fifteen rounds. Schmeling's study of Louis' style led him to openly say, in days before the fight, that he had found the key to victory; fans thought that he was just trying to raise interest in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion. Schmeling spent the first three rounds using his jab, while sneaking his right cross behind his jab. Louis was stunned by his rival's style. In the fourth round, a snapping right landed on Louis' chin, and Louis was sent to the canvas for the first time in his twenty-eight professional fights. As the fight progressed, stunned fans and critics alike watched Schmeling continue to use this style effectively, and Louis apparently had no idea how to solve the puzzle. As rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible. By round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his first run: the only other knockout happened when Rocky Marciano knocked Louis out fifteen years later. By then, Louis was considered a faded champion and Marciano a rising star. Among the attendees at Louis' defeat was Langston Hughes, a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance and noted literary figure. Hughes described the national reaction to Louis' defeat in these terms: > I walked down Seventh Avenue and saw grown men weeping like children, and > women sitting in the curbs with their head in their hands. All across the > country that night when the news came that Joe was knocked out, people > cried. Conversely, the German reaction to the outcome was jubilant. Hitler contacted Schmeling's wife, sending her flowers and a message: \\"For the wonderful victory of your husband, our greatest German boxer, I must congratulate you with all my heart.\\" Schmeling dutifully reciprocated with nationalistic comments for the German press, telling a German reporter after the fight: > At this moment I have to tell Germany, I have to report to the Fuehrer in > particular, that the thoughts of all my countrymen were with me in this > fight; that the Fuehrer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This > thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the > courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colors. Prelude to second fight The weigh-in for Louis vs. Schmeling, 1938 After his victory over Louis, Schmeling negotiated for a title bout with world heavyweight champion James J. Braddock. But the talks fell through ‚Äì partially because of the more lucrative potential of Louis-Braddock matchup, and partially because of the possibility that, in the event of a Schmeling victory, Nazi authorities would not allow subsequent title challenges by American opponents.Schaap, p. 271. Instead, Louis fought Braddock on June 22, 1937, knocking him out in eight rounds in Chicago. Louis, however, publicly announced after the fight that he refused to recognize himself as world champion until he fought Schmeling again. The United States economy had long been suffering from the Great Depression when these two combatants had their two fights. The economic problem affected the United States throughout the 1930s, and many Americans sought inspiration in the world of sports. Compounding the economic instability was a heated political conflict between Nazi Germany and the United States. By the time of the Louis‚ÄìSchmeling rematch in 1938, Nazi Germany had taken over Austria in the Anschluss, heightening tensions between Germany and the other Western powers, and generating much anti-German propaganda in the American media. The German regime generated an onslaught of racially charged propaganda of its own; much of it created by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels based on Schmeling's success in the boxing world. Schmeling did not relish being the focus of such propaganda. He was not a member of the Nazi Party and ‚Äì although proud of his German nationality ‚Äì denied the Nazi claims of racial superiority: \\"I am a fighter, not a politician. I am no superman in any way.\\"Myler, p. 121. Schmeling kept his Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, despite significant pressure,Schaap, p. 144. and, in a dangerous political gamble, refused the \\"Dagger of Honor\\" award offered by Adolf Hitler. In fact, Schmeling had been urged by his friend and legendary ex-champion Jack Dempsey to defect and declare American citizenship. Schmeling never did revoke his German citizenship, however. Schmeling was quoted saying, \\"Once a German, always a German.\\" Nevertheless, the Nazi regime exploited Schmeling in its propaganda efforts, and took careful steps to at least ensure Schmeling's nominal compliance. Schmeling's wife and mother were kept from traveling with him to avoid the chances of defection. Schmeling's entourage also included an official Nazi Party publicist. The publicist not only controlled any possible contrarian remarks by Schmeling, but also issued statements that a black man could not defeat Schmeling, and that Schmeling's purse from the fight would be used to build more German tanks. Hitler himself lifted the nationwide 3:00 a.m. curfew so that caf√©s and bars could carry the broadcast for their patrons. As a result, the perception of the American public had turned decidedly against Schmeling between 1936 and 1938. Schmeling was picketed at his hotel room, received a tremendous amount of hate mail, and was assaulted with cigarette butts and other detritus as he approached the ring.Erenberg, p. 138. A few weeks before the rematch, Louis visited President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the White House. The New York Times quoted Roosevelt as telling the fighter, \\"Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany.\\" In his 1976 biography, Louis wrote, \\"I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me.\\" This time, Louis took training for the bout seriously, giving up golf and women throughout his training.Erenberg, p. 141. Joe Louis said to a friend before the fight, \\"Yeah, I'm scared. I'm scared I might kill Schmeling.\\" A few days before the fight, the New York State Athletic Commission had ruled that Joe Jacobs, Schmeling's manager, was ineligible to work in the German's corner, or be in the locker room, as punishment for a previous public relations infraction involving fighter \\"Two-Ton\\" Tony Galento.Myler, p. 132. In addition, Schmeling's normal corner man, Doc Casey, declined to work with Schmeling, fearing bad publicity.Erenberg, p. 142. As a result, Schmeling sat anxious in the locker room prior to the bout; in contrast, Louis took a two- hour nap.Myler, p. 131. Second fight Louis vs. Schmeling, 1938 The Louis- Schmeling rematch came on June 22, 1938 ‚Äì one year from the day Louis had won the world Heavyweight title. The fighters met once again in a sold-out Yankee Stadium in New York City. Among the more than 70,000 fans in attendance were Clark Gable, Douglas Fairbanks, Gary Cooper, Gregory Peck, and J. Edgar Hoover. The fight drew gate receipts of $1,015,012 (equivalent to $ million in ). Schmeling came out of his corner trying to utilize the same style that got him the victory in their first fight, with a straight-standing posture and his left hand prepared to begin jabbing. Louis' strategy, however, had been to get the fight over early. Prior to the fight he mentioned to his trainer Jack \\"Chappie\\" Blackburn that he would devote all his energy to the first three rounds, and even told sportswriter Jimmy Cannon that he predicted a knockout in one. After only a few seconds of feinting, Louis unleashed a tireless barrage on Schmeling.Erenberg, p. 143. Referee Arthur Donovan stopped action for the first time just over one minute and a half into the fight after Louis connected on five left hooks and a body blow to Schmeling's lower left which had him audibly crying in pain. After sending Louis briefly to his corner, Donovan quickly resumed action, after which Louis went on the attack again, immediately felling the German with a right hook to the face. Schmeling went down this time, arising on the count of three.Erenberg, pp. 143-145. Louis then resumed his barrage, this time focusing on Schmeling's head. After connecting on three clean shots to Schmeling's jaw, the German fell to the canvas again, arising at the count of two.Erenberg, p. 145. With Schmeling having few defenses left at this point, Louis connected at will, sending Schmeling to the canvas for the third time in short order, this time near the ring's center. Schmeling's cornerman Max Machon threw a towel in the ring ‚Äì although under New York state rules, this did not actually end the fight. Machon was therefore forced to enter the ring at the count of eight, at which point Donovan had already declared the fight over. Louis was the winner and world Heavyweight champion, by a technical knockout, two minutes and four seconds into the first round. In all, Louis had thrown 41 punches in the fight, 31 of which landed solidly. Schmeling, by contrast, had been able to throw only two punches. Soundly defeated, Schmeling had to be admitted to Polyclinic Hospital for ten days. During his stay, it was discovered that Louis had cracked several vertebrae in Schmeling's back. Schmeling and his handlers complained after the bout that Louis' initial volley had included an illegal kidney punch, and even refused Louis' visitation at the hospital. The claim resounded hollowly in the media, however, and they eventually chose not to file a formal complaint. Aftermath The fight had racial as well as political undertones. Much of black America pinned its hopes on the outcome of this Joe Louis fight and his other matches, seeing Louis' success as a vehicle for advancing the cause of African Americans everywhere. Poet and author Maya Angelou, among others, recounted her recollection of the first Louis-Schmeling fight. She had listened to the fight over the radio in her uncle's country store in rural Arkansas. While Louis was on the ropes, > My race groaned. It was our people falling. It was another lynching, yet > another black man hanging on a tree . ... this might be the end of the > world. If Joe lost we were back in slavery and beyond help. It would all be > true, the accusations that we were lower types of human beings. Only a > little higher than the apes ... Conversely, when Louis won the fight, emotions were unbounded: > Champion of the world. A Black boy. Some Black mother's son. He was the > strongest man in the world. People drank Coca-Cola like ambrosia and ate > candy bars like Christmas. In his autobiography, Schmeling himself confirmed the public's reaction to the outcome, recounting his ambulance ride to the hospital afterward: \\"As we drove through Harlem, there were noisy, dancing crowds. Bands had left the nightclubs and bars and were playing and dancing on the sidewalks and streets. The whole area was filled with celebration, noise, and saxophones, continuously punctuated by the calling of Joe Louis' name.\\" Reaction in the mainstream American press, while positive toward Louis, reflected the implicit racism in the United States at the time. Lewis F. Atchison of The Washington Post began his story: \\"Joe Louis, the lethargic, chicken-eating young colored boy, reverted to his dreaded role of the 'brown bomber' tonight\\"; Henry McLemore of the United Press called Louis \\"a jungle man, completely primitive as any savage, out to destroy the thing he hates.\\" The day after the fight, blues musician Bill Gaither recorded one of his most famous songs, \\"Champ Joe Louis,\\" a song praising the champ in his defeat of Max Schmeling. Although Schmeling rebounded professionally from the loss to Louis (winning the European Heavyweight Title in 1939 by knocking out Adolf Heuser in the 1st round), the Nazi regime would cease promoting him as a national hero. Schmeling and Nazi authorities grew further in opposition over time. During the Kristallnacht of November 1938, Schmeling provided sanctuary for two young Jewish boys to safeguard them from the Gestapo. Conversely, as a way of punishing Schmeling for his increasingly public resistance, Hitler drafted Schmeling into paratrooper duty in the German Luftwaffe. After brief military service and a comeback attempt in 1947‚Äì48, Schmeling retired from professional boxing. He would go on to invest his earnings in various post-War businesses. His resistance of the Nazi party elevated his status once again to that of a hero in post-war Germany. Louis and Schmeling, 1971. The former rivals became close friends in later life Louis went on to become a major celebrity in the United States and, moreover, is considered the first true African American national hero. When other prominent blacks questioned whether African Americans should serve against the Axis nations in the segregated U.S. Armed Forces, Louis disagreed, saying, \\"There are a lot of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain't gonna fix them.\\" He would go on and serve the United States Army during World War II, but he did not engage in battle while the war was going on. He mostly visited soldiers in Europe to provide them with motivational speeches and with boxing exhibitions. He kept defending the world heavyweight title until 1949, making twenty five consecutive title defenses ‚Äì still a world record among all weight divisions. Louis' finances evaporated later in life, and he became involved in the use of illicit drugs. Louis and Schmeling developed a friendship outside the ring, which endured until Louis' death on April 12, 1981. Their rivalry and friendship was the focus of the 1978 TV movie Ring of Passion.Ring of Passion, Internet Movie Database, retrieved 2008-09-21. Louis got a job as a greeter at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, and Schmeling flew to visit him every year. Louis was reportedly so in need of money, but too damaged to box anymore, so the former champion took up professional wrestling to make ends meet. Schmeling reportedly also sent Louis money in Louis' later years and covered a part of the costs of Louis' funeral, at which he was a pallbearer. Schmeling died 24 years later on February 2, 2005 at the age of 99. He was ranked 55 on The Ring's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time in 2003. Both Louis and Schmeling are members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Louis‚ÄìSchmeling paradox The rivalry between Louis and Schmeling gave rise to the Louis‚ÄìSchmeling paradox, a concept in sports economics. It was first identified and named by Walter C. Neale, in his article \\"The peculiar economics of professional sports\\", published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in February 1964.Pardalos, Panos M. (2012). \\"Fantasy League?: Did you Analyze Your Team‚Äôs Network First?\\". ISE News (University of Florida). Fall 2012: 10. Retrieved 26 May 2014. The paradox, as identified by Neale, is that the general rule that monopoly is the \\"ideal market position of a firm\\" does not hold for professional sports. Where non-sporting firms are \\"better off the smaller or less important the competition\\", sporting firms require competitors to be successful: if Joe Louis had had no competitors, he \\"would have had no one to fight and therefore no income\\". Neale resolved the paradox by drawing a distinction between sporting competition and market competition, holding that \\"the firm in law, as organized in the sporting world, is not the firm of economic analysis\\". The paradox is sometimes re-stated as \\"commercial sporting organizations need close competition if they are to be able to maximize their income\\", as a result of Neale's further conclusion that \\"demand for competition will decrease if the spectators can predict the outcome of the game\\". However, this has been challenged by Roger G. Noll, who noted in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy in 2003 that \\"a team that has dropped out of contentions for a championship will generally draw poorly, but it is likely to sell more tickets if it is playing a team that is at or near that top of the standings than if it is playing another weak team, even though the outcome of the latter game is more uncertain\\".

The main campus is situated in Mt Albert while a secondary WaitƒÅkere campus is situated in Henderson and there are various pop-ups throughout the North Shore. It also offers programmes overseas. History Unitec campus, Carrington Road. Unitec was founded as Carrington Technical Institute in 1976 on the Mt Albert site on Carrington road, which has 55 hectares of grounds. The area on which Unitec's main campus is located was formerly home to the Whau Lunatic Asylum, later known as Carrington Hospital. The hospital building (Building 1) is an imposing brick Italianate-Romanesque structure, located at the northern end of the Unitec Campus. The hospital building was the largest in New Zealand when it was built in the 1860s. The hospital was decommissioned during the early 1990s, and the building is now part of Unitec. The name changed to Carrington Polytechnic in 1987 and then to \\"Unitec Institute of Technology\\" in 1994. Unitec applied for University status in 1999, but the Government ruled, somewhat controversially, in 2005 that Unitec did not meet the academic criteria of a university and would remain an Institute of Technology. In 2006, Unitec opened its Waitakere Campus in the centre of Henderson, West Auckland. The campus is a joint development with the former Waitakere City Council and includes the new WaitƒÅkere Central Library. Unitec's Waitakere campus offers mainly introductory computing, preparing for study, and health and social work courses. In August 2011, Unitec opened a campus in Albany, on Auckland's North Shore, but it was closed in December 2016. On 1 April 2020, Unitec Institute of Technology was subsumed into New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology alongside the 15 other Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs).

On February 23, 2017, O'Hara filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit for $25 million against disgraced ex-Brooklyn D. A. Charles \\"Joe\\" Hynes. The son of working-class Irish Americans and the first in his family to go to college, O'Hara's interest in politics was clear even in childhood: at the age of seven he wrote to his congressman complaining that he didn't have the right to vote but was still required to pay sales tax on toys. At the age of 11 he worked on George McGovern's campaign in the 1972 presidential election. At 16, his investigative reporting for his school newspaper resulted in the school principal being fired for lacking the appropriate license for his job. As a teenager and young man, he was involved with Brooklyn's Reform Democrats against the Meade Esposito machine. In the 1990s, he ran for office six times in primary election never winning but coming within a few hundred votes in a 1992 election for New York State Assembly. In 1996, O'Hara was charged with running for office and voting from a false address. In fact, O'Hara had voted from his girlfriend's apartment, in which approximately half of his time was spent. The discovery of O'Hara's voting habits was used by incumbent Brooklyn District Attorney Charles \\"Joe\\" Hynes to prosecute O'Hara for voting in a place other than his \\"principle and permanent residence\\". Refusing any plea deal, after a mistrial and a reversal on appeal, O'Hara was convicted of a felony in July 1999, sentenced to five years probation, a $20,000 fine and 1,500 hours of community service cleaning a park.

He won numerous awards including the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters award for fiction, the Lila Wallace-Readers Digest Award, and Mississippi's Governor's Award For Excellence in the Arts. He was also the first two-time winner of the Southern Book Award for Fiction. His notable works include Dirty Work, Father and Son, Joe, and Big Bad Love. The latter was adapted for a 2001 film of the same name, starring Debra Winger and Arliss Howard. In 2013 a film adaptation of Larry Brown's Joe was released, featuring Nicolas Cage. Independent filmmaker Gary Hawkins has directed an award-winning documentary of Brown's life and work in The Rough South of Larry Brown (2011). Life and writing Larry Brown was born on July 9, 1951, and grew up near Oxford, Mississippi. He graduated from high school in Oxford, but did not want to go to college, opting instead for a stint in the Marines. Many years later, he took a creative writing class from the University of Mississippi. Brown worked at a small stove company before joining the city fire department in Oxford. An avid reader, Brown began writing in 1980 in his spare time while he worked as a firefighter (at City Station No.1 on North Lamar Blvd.) His nonfiction book On Fire describes how Brown, having trouble with sleeping at the fire station, would stay up to read and write while the other firefighters slept. His duties as a firefighter included answering fire alarms on the University of Mississippi campus and in the city of Oxford, including Rowan Oak‚Äîthe home of William Faulkner, but now a museum. Faulkner died in 1962‚Äîon Larry Brown's 11th birthday. By his own account Brown wrote five unpublished novels, including the first one he wrote about a man-eating bear loose in Yellowstone Park. Brown used these kinds of personal experiences when talking to beginning writers. He could tell them not to become discouraged, if only to judge by the rather unceremonious false starts to his own writing career. Brown also indicated that he wrote hundreds of short stories before he began to be published. His first publication was a short story that appeared in the June 1982 issue of biker magazine Easyriders. His first books were two collections of short stories: Facing the Music (1988) and Big Bad Love (1990). After 1990, Brown turned to writing full-time and increasingly turned to the novel as his primary form. Brown's novels include Dirty Work (1989), Father and Son (1996), Joe (1991), Fay (2000), and The Rabbit Factory (2003). His later works, especially, are marked by gritty realism, sudden and shocking violence, and dischronic narrative. Brown responded to criticism regarding the \\"brutality\\" in his work by saying, \\"Well that's fine. It's ok if you call it brutal, but just admit by God that it's honest.\\" In March 2007, Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill published Brown's unfinished novel, A Miracle of Catfish. Although Brown died before finishing the book, the final page of the published version includes his notes about how he wanted the novel to end. The novel includes a lengthy introduction by Brown's editor, Shannon Ravenel, discussing her work on the project and her work with Brown over the years. Except for the novel The Rabbit Factory, all of Brown's books were published by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, now a division of Workman Publishing. The paperback editions of Brown's books were issued by various publishers, including Warner Books, Algonquin, Holt, and Vintage Books, a division of Random House. Brown's nonfiction includes On Fire (1995), on the subject of his 17 years (1973‚Äì1990) as a firefighter, and Billy Ray's Farm (2001). For one semester, Brown taught as a writer-in-residence in the creative writing program at the University of Mississippi, temporarily taking over the position held by his friend Barry Hannah. He later served as visiting writer at the University of Montana in Missoula. He taught briefly at other colleges throughout the United States. He has been compared to other Southern writers, including Cormac McCarthy, William Faulkner, and Harry Crews. In interviews and some of his essays, Brown cited these authors, along with Flannery O'Connor, Raymond Carver, and Charles Bukowski, as influences. Brown had also cited contemporary music as an influence, and his tastes were broad. He appeared with the Texas alt-rock band fronted by Alejandro Escovedo, a good friend of his. He also cited the lyrics of Leonard Cohen as an influence. He had friends in the film industry, including Billy Bob Thornton. Brown died of an apparent heart attack at his home in the Yocona community, near Oxford, in November 2004.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988, and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1983 to 1988. The son of Albert L√©cuyer and Suzanne Delaloye, he grew up in Ste. Agathe and was educated at St. Boniface College and the University of Manitoba, working as an educator-administrator before entering public life. He directed special projects in the Bureau de l'√âducation fran√ßais for the Department of Education, and was a teacher in the St. Boniface school division. He also spent five years in Africa as a teacher with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and was a member of the Franco-Manitoban Society. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the election of 1981, scoring a comfortable victory in the east-Winnipeg riding of Radisson. The NDP won a majority government in this election, and Lecuyer was named Government House Leader soon after the party's victory. He was a leading supporter of the legal re-entrenchment of French language services within the province. Lecuyer was named Minister of Environment and Workplace Safety and Health on November 4, 1983.

EFMPlus is a related code, used in DVDs and Super Audio CDs (SACDs). EFM and EFMPlus were both invented by Kees A. Schouhamer Immink. According to European Patent Office former President Beno√Æt Battistelli, \\"Immink's invention of EFM made a decisive contribution to the digital revolution.\\"  Technological classification  EFM, EFM Patent, applied in Compact Disc, CD-R, MiniDisc. belongs to the class of DC-free run-length limited (RLL) codes; these have the following two properties: * the spectrum (power density function) of the encoded sequence vanishes at the low-frequency end, and * both the minimum and maximum number of consecutive bits of the same kind are within specified bounds. In optical recording systems, servo mechanisms accurately follow the track in three dimensions: radial, focus, and rotational speed. Everyday handling damage, such as dust, fingerprints, and tiny scratches, not only affects retrieved data, but also disrupts the servo functions. In some cases, the servos may skip tracks or get stuck. Specific sequences of pits and lands are particularly susceptible to disc defects, and disc playability can be improved if such sequences are barred from recording. The use of EFM produces a disc that is highly resilient to handling and solves the engineering challenge in a very efficient manner.  How it works  Under EFM rules, the data to be stored is first broken into eight-bit blocks (bytes). Each eight-bit block is translated into a corresponding fourteen-bit codeword using a lookup table. The 14-bit words are chosen such that binary ones are always separated by a minimum of two and a maximum of ten binary zeroes. This is because bits are encoded with NRZI encoding, or modulo-2 integration, so that a binary one is stored on the disc as a change from a land to a pit or a pit to a land, while a binary zero is indicated by no change. A sequence 0011 would be changed into 1101 or its inverse 0010 depending on the previous pit written. If there are two consecutive zeroes between two ones, then the written sequence will have three consecutive zeros (or ones), for example, 010010 will translate into 100011 (or 011100). The EFM sequence 000100010010000100 will translate into 111000011100000111 (or its inverse). Because EFM ensures there are at least two zeroes between every two ones, it is guaranteed that every pit and land is at least three bit-clock cycles long. This property is very useful since it reduces the demands on the optical pickup used in the playback mechanism. The ten consecutive-zero maximum ensures worst-case clock recovery in the player. EFM requires three merging bits between adjacent fourteen-bit codewords. Although they are not needed for decoding, they ensure that consecutive codewords can be concatenated without violating the specified minimum and maximum runlength constraint. They are also selected to maintain DC balance of the encoded sequence. Thus, in the final analysis, seventeen bits of disc space are needed to encode eight bits of data. Tekla S. Perry. \\"Kees Immink: The Man Who Put Compact Discs on Track\\". 2017. quote: \\"Three merging bits separate each sequence, for a total of 17 bits to represent each 8-bit chunk of data.\\"  EFMPlus  EFMPlus, EFMPlus Patent, applied in DVD, DVD¬±RW, SACD is the channel code used in DVDs and SACDs. The EFMPlus encoder is based on a deterministic finite automaton having four states, which translates eight-bit input words into sixteen-bit codewords. The binary sequence generated by the finite state machine encoder has at least two and at most ten zeros between consecutive ones, which is the same as in classic EFM. There are no packing (merging) bits as in classic EFM. EFMPlus effectively reduces storage requirements by one channel bit per user byte, increasing storage capacity by 1/16 = 6.25%. Decoding of EFMPlus-generated sequences is accomplished by a sliding-block decoder of length two, that is, two consecutive codewords are required to uniquely reconstitute the sequence of input words.

The Orchestra was created in 1999 under the direction of Gordon B. Hinckley, then the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as part of an initiative to continually strengthen and expand the capabilities of the church's music organizations.  History  The LDS Conference Center, primary concert hall of the Orchestra at Temple Square during renovation of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. Formed in 1999, the Orchestra fulfilled the longtime desire of LDS Church leaders of having a permanent orchestra both to enhance the quality of The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square (Choir) performances and to involve instrumental musicians in church music projects on the same volunteer basis as Tabernacle Choir members. \\"About the Orchestra at Temple Square\\", PBS WGBH, 2018. Retrieved on 5 April 2020. While some initial recording contracts in the first years of the Orchestra's existence were paid, with the creation of the Tabernacle Choir's own recording label the 110-member Orchestra has evolved into a purely volunteer organization. Although many Orchestra members are professional musicians, in order to participate they are required to give their time and talents to the Orchestra without financial compensation. Like the Tabernacle Choir, the Orchestra makes its home in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. During structural renovations to the Tabernacle, the Orchestra rehearsed and performed in the adjacent LDS Conference Center, as did the Choir. The Orchestra was initially directed by former Tabernacle Choir associate director (and current Creative Director of Utah Chamber Artists) Barlow Bradford. Under his direction the group developed into a critically acclaimed symphony orchestra. Bradford unexpectedly resigned shortly after the 2002 Winter Olympics. The Orchestra continued under the musical supervision of Tabernacle Choir director Craig Jessop, until his abrupt resignation/dismissal on March 4, 2008. Under his direction the Orchestra increased its role as accompanist to the Tabernacle Choir and Temple Square Chorale, but continued to perform on its own under the baton of Igor Gruppman, concertmaster of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. Gruppman was the Orchestra‚Äôs concertmaster at the inaugural concert in 1999 and was named conductor of the Orchestra in 2003.\\"Orchestra on Temple Square celebrating 20 years this weekend\\", ABC 4, 24 October 2019.

Repertoire and performances  The Orchestra performs masterworks from the standard symphony orchestra repertoire several times a year, both at home and on tour, under the direction of the Ukrainian-born Gruppman. The Orchestra also regularly appears in the Tabernacle Choir's weekly radio and TV broadcasts of Music & the Spoken Word, the Choir's acclaimed Christmas specials on PBS, and in the Choir's recording projects, including several on the Telarc label. More recent recordings on the Choir's own label have enjoyed tremendous success, appearing prominently on Billboard's classical and classical crossover charts. Additionally, the Orchestra accompanies the Temple Square Chorale in its semiannual concerts and has provided the music for various LDS Church stage productions such as the annual Christmas favorite Savior of the World.

Broadcast Each broadcast revolves around a specific theme which is usually based on a religious and uplifting topic which have included family, hope, faith, Christmas, patriotism, joy, peace, kindness, etc., and are usually broadly Christian in application. =Music= The choir performs both sacred and secular pieces that correspond with the chosen message. In addition to hymns and sacred anthems, the choir has performed Broadway songs, such as \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\" from The Sound of Music, patriotic American songs, such as \\"America the Beautiful\\", as well as a wide range of other selections. The broadcast also regularly features an organ solo played by one of the tabernacle organists. On some occasions, special guests will also perform with the choir during the broadcast.

Choir The Grammy Award-winning Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square is a 360-voice choir that was founded in Utah in 1847, one month after the Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. Called \\"America's Choir\\" by U.S. President Ronald Reagan, all members of the choir are volunteers and are not remunerated. The choir is led by director Mack Wilberg. In addition to Music and & Spoken Word, the Choir performs regularly throughout the year, including an annual Christmas Concert, Pioneer Concert, and various other concerts as well providing music for the LDS General Conference.

Orchestra The Orchestra at Temple Square was created in 1999 in order to increase the aesthetic and musical quality of performances. The Orchestra frequently provides accompaniment for the weekly radio and TV broadcasts. The Orchestra also undertakes its own concert season performing from standard orchestral literature, which has included Mahler's Symphony No. 4, the Firebird Suite by Stravinsky and Symphony No. 9 (from The New World) by Dvo≈ô√°k. Like the Tabernacle Choir, the 110-member Orchestra is made up of volunteers, some of whom are also professional musicians. Organ and organists The organ in the Tabernacle is a very visible and notable part of the Tabernacle. The original organ was made by Joseph Harris Ridges (1827‚Äì1914), a native of Australia, and contained seven hundred pipes. However, the number of pipes is now 11,623, making the Tabernacle organ one of the world's largest pipe organs. The current organ is largely the work of G. Donald Harrison of the former Aeolian-Skinner organ firm. It was completed in the late 1940s. The organ has undergone a few minor modifications since that time. Presently, the Tabernacle organ is played regularly by five main organists when accompanying the choir. Richard Elliott, Andrew Unsworth, and Brian Mathias are full-time organists, while Bonnie Goodliffe and Linda Margetts are part-time organists. =The \\"Spoken Word\\"= The announcer opens and closes the broadcast with an adaptation of Richard L. Evans's hallmark phrase, beginning with, \\"From the Crossroads of the West, we welcome you to Temple Square in Salt Lake City for Music and the Spoken Word with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square.\\" The announcer introduces the music with information about the piece, or with short scriptural or literary passages. At some point, usually near the middle of the program, an inspirational spoken message is delivered. The quote, \\"Again we leave you, from within the shadows of the everlasting hills; may peace be with you, this day and always,\\" signals the end of the program, and it is usually followed by the choir singing the hymn \\"God Be With You Till We Meet Again\\". Announcers Since its inception in 1929, the \\"spoken word\\" segment of the program has been voiced by three separate individuals. The original writer, producer, and announcer of the spoken portion of the broadcast was Richard L. Evans, who continued in that capacity for over forty years until his death in 1971. At that time the writing and announcing assignments were split, with a committee doing the writing. J. Spencer Kinard was the announcer from 1972 until he stepped down in 1990. Lloyd D. Newell has been the announcer from 1990 to the present. Tabernacle Tabernacle in 1937 The program is broadcast from the Salt Lake Tabernacle, more commonly called the Mormon Tabernacle. The dome-shaped building was built between 1864 and 1867 on the west center-line axis of the Salt Lake Temple and is located inside Temple Square. The overall seating capacity of the building (since its renovation) is 7,000, which includes the choir area and balcony gallery. The central feature of the tabernacle is the large pipe organ. Between 2005 and 2007, the program was temporarily housed in the Conference Center located across the street from Temple Square.\\"Tabernacle Choir Getting to Know Unique Conference Center\\", Liahona, August 2005.

Fried turkey has been a longtime favorite in the Southern United States, and has recently become popular in other parts of the country because of the reduced time needed to cook a turkey in a deep fryer, versus other conventional methods such as an oven or a rotisserie grill. Equipment A traditional turkey fryer kit consists of a burner, a large stock pot with lid, a basket and/or poultry holder, a lifter and a thermometer. The burner operates on a standard propane tank that usually must be purchased separately. Current burner units are much lower than the original design so as to increase stability and help prevent tip-overs. Lower cost units use an aluminum stock pot and a steel burner while higher-end units include a stainless steel pot and burner. Some stock pots may have an integrated valve to drain the oil. The poultry holder consists of an aluminum or stainless steel disk with a metal rod formed into a loop with the ends affixed to the center of the disk. The loop is placed through the cavity of the turkey and the lifter is used to lower and remove the turkey. If a basket is used, it includes a bail that is grabbed by the lifter. The thermometer has a long probe and is used to monitor the temperature of the oil. The fryer can also be used to cook other poultry and seafood. The stock pot lid is used to cover the pot only when not actually frying or when preparing other foods by boiling in water. Heavy gloves and an apron are recommended. Some vendors now offer an add-on temperature control valve. This consists of a valve that goes between the propane tank and the burner and a lead with a thermal sensor. The sensor is placed into the oil and the valve adjusts the flame to achieve a constant temperature. Electric turkey fryers have been introduced that can be used indoors. Although the electric fryer does not heat up as fast as with propane, it includes a thermostat with a timer and a thermal safety shut-off. Electric fryers can also be used to prepare other foods by frying or boiling. Safety Deep-frying a turkey uses oil over an open flame, thus it presents some hazards. The operation must be considered hazardous from the time the flame is lit to the time the turkey is removed and the oil is cooled. Risks include fire, severe burns, and explosion. A number of homes and other buildings (such as garages) have been destroyed due to the unsafe use of a turkey fryer and Underwriters Laboratories has refused to list turkey fryers. Preparation Deep-frying requires a cooking oil with a high smoke point such as canola oil, peanut oil, safflower oil or a blend. Cooking time is about four minutes per pound (or about 7 minutes per kilo) of turkey, so a 15-pound turkey needs to be cooked for about one hour in 350 ¬∞F (175 ¬∞C) oil. Oil can be recovered, stored, and reused several times before it becomes rancid or contaminated. Storage life can be extended by filtering used oil and keeping it cool. A generous rub of salt and pepper may be used to increase flavor. The turkey can also be seasoned with an injectable marinade. Fried turkeys cannot be stuffed, nor do they provide drippings or broth for gravy.

He was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the third round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Colorado. High school career Brown was named Prep Football Report and Super Prep All-American, first-team All-State, and Daily Herald first-team All-Area as senior at Naperville North High School in Naperville, Illinois, rushing for 1,250 yards and 15 touchdowns. He rushed for 2,300 yards and 30 touchdowns in his career at Naperville North, where he played with future Titans teammate Justin McCareins, as well as former Houston Texans defensive back Glenn Earl. College career Brown was recruited by Gary Barnett at Northwestern University and signed with NU under new coach Randy Walker after Barnett took the Colorado head coaching job. Unhappy with being switched to receiver, Brown left Northwestern after the 1999 season and played a year at Fort Scott Junior College before transferring again to the University of Colorado. At Colorado, Barnett provided him an opportunity to become one of the school's all-time leading rushers, including a school record 6 TDs against Nebraska in 2001 during his sophomore season. Brown's success continued into 2002, playing himself into a dark-horse Heisman Trophy candidate, before a late-season injury derailed his season and caused him to miss 2 and a half games. To most Colorado fans' dismay, Brown elected to skip his senior season and enter the NFL draft. Professional career =Tennessee Titans= Brown was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the 3rd round of the 2003 NFL Draft, with the 93rd overall selection. As a rookie in 2003, Brown was not available to play during the preseason and five regular season games due to a hamstring injury. Although being behind two other backs, Brown averaged 3.9 yards per carry on 56 carries totaling 221 yards, the Titans' team high for the 2003 season. He also performed very well in the playoffs. At the beginning of the 2004 season, Brown was promoted to starting running back due to the absence of Eddie George in the Titans' lineup. He had a strong start, and finished the season with 1,067 yards, but several injuries forced him to miss significant time and also affected his play. He led the NFL in Yards per carry in 2004. In January 2005, Brown underwent successful surgery on both ankles. In 2005, Brown ran for 851 yards. Brown has been criticized in the past for running too upright and not running as powerfully as other backs his size. In 2006, the Titans drafted LenDale White, a more traditional power runner, coupled with the emergence of Travis Henry, Brown was deactivated for several games during the 2006 season. Brown completed his contract with the Titans before leaving as a free agent to sign with the Houston Texans. Brown rushed for a career- high 175 yards against the Jacksonville Jaguars on September 9, 2007. =Houston Texans= On March 13, 2008, Brown was signed by the Houston Texans to a two-year deal worth $3.6 million, including an $800,000 signing bonus. Brown played well for the Texans, but his Week 3 fumble, his only of the season, against the Jacksonville Jaguars cost the team a chance to tie a game and force overtime. He also was intercepted on a halfback pass that was a poorly conceived play. Brown completed his two-year contract with the Texans. Personal life Brown is the younger brother of Levelle Brown, fullback formerly of the Chicago Rush of the Arena Football League. Chris has a younger sister named LaShawndra Brown who played Division III basketball. Chris lives in Houston with his wife and three children.

Hanke () is an American applied economist at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He is also a Senior Fellow and Director of the Troubled Currencies Project at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, DC, and Co-Director of the Johns Hopkins University's Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise in Baltimore, Maryland. Hanke is known for his work as a currency reformer in emerging-market countries such as Albania, Argentina, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Estonia, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Montenegro, Russia, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. He was a Senior Economist with President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers from 1981 to 1982, and has served as an adviser to heads of state in countries throughout Asia, South America, Europe, and the Middle East. He is also known for his pioneering work on currency boards, dollarization, hyperinflation, water pricing and demand, benefit-cost analysis, privatization, and other topics in applied economics. Hanke has written extensively as a columnist for Forbes magazine and other publications. He is also a currency and commodity trader. Early life and education Steve Hanke was born in Macon, Georgia in 1942 and grew up in Atlantic, Iowa, where he attended Atlantic High School. He then attended the University of Colorado Boulder, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Hanke earned a B.S. in Business Administration (1964) and a Ph.D. in Economics (1969) from the University of Colorado. Academic career Hanke's first academic appointment was at the Colorado School of Mines in 1966, when he was 24. During this time, Hanke developed and taught courses in mineral and petroleum economics, while completing his Ph.D. dissertation on the impact of meter installation on municipal water demand. Hanke then joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University, where he initially specialized in water resource economics. After six years at Johns Hopkins, including a one- year visiting professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, Hanke attained the rank of Full Professor, one of the fastest promotions to that rank in the school's history. At present, Hanke teaches courses in applied economics and finance that are widely recognized as a gateway for Hopkins students to gain employment on Wall Street. He is jointly appointed in the Johns Hopkins Department of Economics and the Johns Hopkins Department of Environmental Health and Engineering. Over the course of his career, Hanke has held editorial positions with a number of academic journals, including the Journal of Economic Policy Reform; Water Resources Research; Land Economics; and Water Engineering and Management. He currently holds editorial positions with The International Economy, The Independent Review, Cato Journal, Review of Austrian Economics, Economic Journal Watch, and Central Banking. In 1995, Hanke and Johns Hopkins University History Professor Louis Galambos founded the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health and Study of Business Enterprise. Hanke is also a Senior Fellow and Director of the Troubled Currencies Project at the Cato Institute, a Special Counselor to the Center for Financial Stability, and a member of the Charter Council of the Society of Economic Measurement. Hanke is a senior advisor at Renmin University's International Monetary Research Institute, along with Nobel laureate Robert Mundell of Columbia. =Water resource economics= In 1969, Hanke began his academic career as a water resource economist in the Johns Hopkins Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering (now the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering), a department founded by famed sanitary engineer Abel Wolman. At the time, the department was known as the premier water resource engineering department in the country, and was home to world-renowned sanitary engineer John C. Geyer, with whom Hanke would frequently collaborate. Hanke was hired to continue the water-related research program at Johns Hopkins that began during the Geyer era. During his initial years in the department, Hanke focused on issues including water pricing and demand, benefit-cost analysis, system design, and leak detection and control. He produced a number of important pieces of scholarship, including the first event study of the impact of water meter installation on water use, as well as sewer interceptor design criteria which are still commonly used today in Europe. During this time, Hanke served as the Associate Editor of the Water Resources Bulletin and Water Resources Research, as the economics editor for Water Engineering and Management, and as a member of the editorial board of Land Economics. He was also an adviser to the French water companies Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux (now Veolia Environment) and Compagnie Lyonnaise des Eaux, as well as to the engineering firms Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in Australia, and Binnie & Partners in London. In 1981, Hanke was appointed a senior economist with the President's Council of Economic Advisers, where his responsibilities included the Reagan White House's water portfolio. While at the CEA, Hanke led a team that re-wrote the federal government's Principles and Guidelines for Water and Land Related Resources Implementation Studies, to include more rigorous benefit-cost analysis requirements. Hanke continues to be active in the water resources field, focusing primarily on municipal water system privatization. He is currently a member of the Johns Hopkins University Global Water Program. =Privatization= Hanke has produced eight books and numerous articles and proposals dealing with the privatization of public- sector resources. In 1972, he was a Research Associate at the National Museums of Kenya, where he worked with anthropologist and conservationist Richard Leakey on the economics of big game cropping and hunting, as well as the privatization of big game reserves to combat poaching. Hanke also worked with Barney Dowdle of the University of Washington and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Lincoln County, Oregon on a proposal to privatize portions of their reservation, as a means of improving economic opportunity on Native American reservations. While at the White House, Hanke worked closely with his long-time associate, CEA member William A. Niskanen. He was known as a member of the supply-side economics movement within the Reagan Administration. It was during this time that Hanke was noted for developing President Ronald Reagan's program for privatizing public assets and services ‚Äì particularly municipal water systems and public grazing and timber lands. This plan was endorsed by one of President Reagan's closest allies, Nevada Senator Paul Laxalt, among others.Laxalt, Paul. \\"Washington View.\\" Humboldt Sun 17 May 1982: n. pag. Print. Hanke's work to privatize public lands put him at odds with Secretary of the Interior James Watt and members of the Sagebrush Rebellion, who sought to transfer federal public lands to state control, rather than to private ownership. In 1982, Hanke left the CEA, joining a number of influential Reagan Administration supply-siders, including Martin Anderson, Norman B. Ture, and Paul Craig Roberts. In 1984, Hanke was appointed a Senior Adviser to the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, where he advised Senators Steve Symms and Paul Laxalt on privatization. Although the English term \\"reprivatisation\\" first appeared in The Economist magazine in the 1930s, and subsequently in various academic journals, Hanke and his wife, Liliane, are often credited with popularizing the term \\"privatization\\" ‚Äì derived from the French term \\"privatise\\" ‚Äì in the American economic lexicon during the 1980s, as well as for bringing about its inclusion in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. Hanke has authored numerous articles on the subject of privatization, including the entry for \\"Privatization\\" in the 1987 edition of The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics. =Currency boards and dollarization= After Hong Kong reinstated its currency board in 1983, Hanke began to collaborate with his fellow Johns Hopkins Professor, and Margaret Thatcher's personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, on the subject of currency boards. A currency board is a monetary authority that issues a local currency that is fully backed by a foreign reserve currency, and which is freely convertible with the foreign reserve currency at a fixed exchange rate. Walters was a key advocate of the reestablishment of Hong Kong's currency board. Hanke and Walters established a currency board research program at Johns Hopkins. One of Hanke's first post-doctoral fellows in that program was Kurt Schuler. Shortly after Schuler's arrival at Johns Hopkins, Hanke and Schuler discovered that John Maynard Keynes was an advocate of currency boards. Hanke and Schuler presented these findings, including original documentation, in a book edited by Walters and Hanke. During this time, Hanke also began conducting research on dollarization, whereby a country replaces its domestic currency with a stable foreign currency ‚Äì creating a de facto fixed-exchange-rate monetary system between two countries. Over the course of his career, Hanke has written over 20 books and monographs and over 300 articles on currency boards and dollarization. Many of these were written in collaboration with Kurt Schuler. Hanke also co-authored with Sir Alan Walters the entry for \\"Currency Boards\\" in the 1992 edition of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance. In addition, he played a central role in drafting and bringing about the inclusion of the so-called \\"Hanke Amendment\\" in the 1993 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. This measure, sponsored by Senators Phil Graham, Bob Dole, Connie Mack, Jesse Helms, and Steve Symms allowed U.S. contributions to the International Monetary Fund to be used for the purpose of establishing currency boards. =Hyperinflation= Hanke has also written extensively on the subject of hyperinflation, which occurs when a country's inflation rate exceeds 50% per month. In 2008, Hanke and Alex Kwok published a paper, which estimated that Zimbabwe's hyperinflation peaked in November 2008 at %. This makes Zimbabwe's hyperinflation the second-highest in history ‚Äì peaking 3.5 months after the Mugabe government stopped reporting inflation statistics, and 1.5 months after the IMF's last estimate of Zimbabwe's inflation rate, with a peak inflation rate 30 million times higher than the last official rate. Hanke employs a unique methodology, based on the principle of purchasing power parity, which allows him to accurately estimate inflation in countries with very high inflation rates. Using this methodology, Hanke and his collaborators discovered several cases of hyperinflation that had previously gone unreported in the academic literature and popular press. These include the 1923 hyperinflation episode in the Free City of Danzig, and more recently, suspected cases in North Korea (2011), and Iran (2012). In 2012, Hanke and Nicholas Krus documented all 56 cases of hyperinflation that have occurred in history, in \\"World Hyperinflations,\\" a chapter in the Routledge Handbook of Major Events in Economic History.\\" Since then, Hanke has documented two additional cases of hyperinflation: One occurred in Venezuela in 2016, and the other occurred in Zimbabwe in 2017. In 2013, Hanke founded the Troubled Currencies Project, a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins University and the Cato Institute, in order to track exchange-rate and inflation data in countries including Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela. =Monetary analysis= Hanke's views on monetary policy are influenced by his experience as a currency and commodities trader, as well as by the economics of Milton Friedman, Robert Mundell, and Friedrich Hayek. Hanke is a proponent of Divisia monetary aggregates, originated by William A. Barnett of the University of Kansas and the Center for Financial Stability. Barnett's derivation uses the Divisia quantity index formula of Francois Divisia with the monetary-assets user-cost-price formula derived by Barnett (1980). Hanke also favors broad monetary aggregates as articulated by economists, including Tim Congdon. Hanke argues that changes in nominal national income are a function of changes in broad money aggregates. In 2012, Hanke developed a method of monetary analysis known as State-Money/Bank-Money Analysis (SMBMA). This methodology is based on John Maynard Keynes' distinction between money produced by a central bank (\\"state money\\") and money produced via the private banking sector, through deposit creation (\\"bank money\\"), contained in the 1930 classic A Treatise on Money. Hanke has employed SMBMA as a method of analyzing the response of various countries to the 2008 financial crisis. In particular, Hanke has employed SMBMA for the United States, the United Kingdom, and various countries in the European Union to study the pro-cyclical effects of higher capital-asset ratios implemented during economic downturns. Hanke has been an outspoken critic of pro-cyclical capital requirements imposed under Basel III, Dodd-Frank, and other financial regulatory regimes. Also, he is on the advisory board of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) in London, where he regularly contributes to the OMFIF's The Bulletin and is involved in meetings regarding financial and monetary systems. = Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar = Hanke and his colleague Richard Conn Henry, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Physics and Astronomy, developed the Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar, which aims to reform the current Gregorian calendar by making every year identical. With the Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar, every calendar date would always fall on the same day of the week. Some of the advantages would include a permanent day of the week for all holidays; a simplification of financial calculations, and it would not draw criticism from religious groups because it retains the Sabbath. Economic Advising and Currency Reform Hanke began advising political leaders on economic issues in the late 1970s, when he served as a member of the Governor's Council of Economic Advisers for the State of Maryland, along with Carl Christ and Clopper Almon. After stints at the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, and the President's Task Force on Project Economic Justice during the Reagan administration, Hanke began advising heads of state in developing countries on a pro-bono basis. Hanke has advised five presidents (Bulgaria, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and Montenegro); five cabinet ministers (Albania, Argentina, Ecuador, Yugoslavia, and the United Arab Emirates); and has held two cabinet-level positions (Lithuania and Montenegro). As the fall of communism and the Soviet ruble began to spark currency crises throughout the former Soviet Union, Hanke began to work as an economic adviser to a number of heads of state in newly independent countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. In collaboration with his then-post- doctoral student, Kurt Schuler, Hanke developed a blueprint for a currency board reform package, which he proposed in a number of countries throughout the 1990s, including Albania, Argentina, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador Estonia, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Montenegro, Russia, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. =Argentina= In 1989, Hanke met Argentine President Carlos Menem, who connected Hanke and his wife, Liliane, with the libertarian faction in the Argentine Congress led by Alvaro Alsogaray, for the purpose of developing a currency reform that would end Argentina's inflation problems. Hanke was an early proponent of a currency board system for Argentina, which he outlined in a 1991 book. The book, ¬øBanco Central O Caja de Conversi√≥n? was co-authored by Kurt Schuler and included a preface by Argentine Congressman Jos√© Mar√≠a Ibarbia, who was a member of the Alsogaray faction. Later, Hanke worked closely with Menem and members of the Argentine Congress to implement a currency board, along the general lines of Hanke and Schuler's original proposal.Effinger, Anthony. \\"Argentina Appoints U.S. Professor as Currency Advisor.\\" Bloomberg[Buenos Aires] 18 Jan. 1995: n. pag. Print. The result was not an orthodox currency board, but rather a \\"Convertibility System,\\" passed in the Convertibility Law of 1991, which ended Argentina's hyperinflation episode. Following Hanke and Sir Alan Walters' 1994 prediction of the Mexican peso's collapse,Hanke, Steve H., and Alan Walters. \\"The Wobbly Peso.\\" Forbes 154.1 (1994): 161. Business Source Complete. Web. 6 Dec. 2013. Argentine Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo invited Hanke to serve as his adviser. During this time, Hanke's primary role was to leverage his scholarship and experience as one of the experts who was in the middle of the currency reform debates before the adoption of the Convertibility System ‚Äì as well as his credibility established when he predicted the Tequila Crisis ‚Äì to explain how the Convertibility System operated at the time, and to restore confidence in Argentina and the peso's international credibility.Hanke, Steve H. \\"Pegged Out.\\" Forbes 155.2 (1995): 119. Business Source Complete. Web. 6 Dec. 2013. At the time, Hanke was described by Argentine newspapers as \\"Cavallo's spokesman\\"Martinez, Oscar. \\"El Vocero De Cavallo.\\" Noticias [Buenos Aires] 8 Oct. 1995: 52‚Äì53. Print. and the \\"generator of confidence\\" in the Argentine economy.\\"Profesi√≥n: Generador De Confianza.\\" Editorial. El Economista 3 Nov. 1995: 21. Print. Argentina's Convertibility System differed in several key respects from Hanke's original proposal, however. In October 1991, the year the system was implemented, Hanke warned in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the Convertibility System could begin to function as a central bank, and eventually collapse.Steve H. Hanke. \\"Argentina Should Abolish Its Central Bank,\\" Wall Street Journal, October 25, 1991 https://ssrn.com/abstract=2262476 This prediction came true in the late 1990s, as the Argentine Convertibility System began to function like a central bank and engage in sterilization. Hanke wrote many articles showing that the Convertibility System was not a currency board. As the convertibility system began to falter, Carlos Menem, on Hanke's advice, proposed dollarization for Argentina ‚Äì first in 1995 and again in January 1999. In February 1999, Menem asked Hanke to prepare a dollarization blueprint for Argentina. This proposal was never acted upon, and the Convertibility System ultimately collapsed in 2002. =Yugoslavia and Albania= In January 1990, Hanke was appointed the personal economic adviser to Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zivko Pregl. Although Pregl was at one point a leader of the Communist League of Yugoslavia, he sought Hanke's counsel on ways to liberalize Yugoslavia's socialist economy. During this time, Hanke proposed a number of free-market reforms, including the privatization of Yugoslavia's pension system, as well as a currency board system to address the failing Yugoslav dinar. In 1991, the Ekonomski Institute Beograd published a book, in the Serbo-Croatian language, which Hanke and Schuler co-authored. The book laid out the details about what would have been a Yugoslav currency board. However, these efforts were suspended when the Yugoslav civil war broke out and Pregl resigned in June 1991. After the war broke out, Hanke continued his involvement in the Balkans, working with Deloitte & Touche's Eastern European division to establish new Deloitte offices and bring traditional financial accounting to the formerly Communist country. In 1991, Hanke began advising Albanian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Gramoz Pashko on the possibility of establishing a currency board in Albania. The proposal was contained in Hanke and Kurt Schuler's 1991 monograph A Currency Board Solution for the Albanian Lek, published by the International Freedom Foundation. The proposal was never acted upon. =Bulgaria= In 1990, Hanke anticipated Bulgaria's 1991 hyperinflation episode and began designing a currency board system for Bulgaria. He incorporated this proposal into a monograph co-authored with Kurt Schuler. The monograph, Teeth for the Bulgarian Lev: A Currency Board Solution was published in 1991. Hanke continued his work on a Bulgarian currency board, periodically visiting Sofia throughout the early 1990s. In late 1996, Hanke and Schuler's currency reform handbook Currency Boards for Developing Countries gained popularity when a pirated Bulgarian-language version of the book became a best-seller in Sofia.Robinson, Anthony. \\"Idea Whose Time Has Come.\\" Financial Times [London] 26 Mar. 1997: n. pag. Print. In 1997, during Bulgaria's second episode of hyperinflation, Hanke was appointed as an Adviser to Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, and worked to bring about the establishment of Bulgaria's currency board. Inspired by the original Hanke- Schuler blueprint, members of the Bulgarian government drafted a law which converted the Bulgarian National Bank to a currency board system. Acting in his capacity as Stoyanov's adviser, Hanke continued to be deeply involved in fine-tuning and steering his idea to full adoption, throughout the drafting, legislative, and implementation process. Bulgaria adopted the proposal and installed the currency board on July 1, 1997. The currency board linked the lev to the German Deutsche mark, and later the euro. Upon adoption, the Bulgarian Currency Board immediately put an end to the country's 1997 hyperinflation episode. Hanke continued to serve as President Stoyanov's adviser until the end of his term in 2002. Hanke remains active in Bulgaria, as a vocal supporter of the currency board, the country's flat tax, and anti- corruption measures. He frequently contributes to the Bulgarian publications Capital, Trud and Novinite, among others. In 2013, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences awarded Hanke a Doctorate Honoris Causa, and, in 2015, Varna Free University awarded Hanke the title Doctor Honoris Causa, in honor of his scholarship on currency boards and his reform efforts in Bulgaria. In 2018, the D.A. Tsenov Academy of Economics awarded Hanke a Doctorate Honoris Causa in honor of Hanke's work as the father of the Bulgarian currency board. =Estonia= In 1992, Hanke, Kurt Schuler, and Lars Jonung ‚Äì then a Professor at the Stockholm School of Economics ‚Äì released a book in both English and Estonian containing a blueprint for an Estonian currency board. After Jonung was appointed Chief Economic Advisor to Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, in 1992, Jonung convinced Bildt to embrace the idea of a currency board for Estonia and arrange for its presentation to the Estonian government. In May 1992, Hanke presented the currency board blueprint to members of Estonia's Constituent Assembly in Tallinn. One month later, in June 1992, Estonia adopted a monetary system based on the Hanke-Jonung-Schuler proposal. Estonia thus abandoned the Soviet ruble and began issuing its own currency, linking the Estonian kroon to the German mark at a fixed exchange rate. Following the introduction of the euro, the kroon was linked to the euro, until January 1, 2011, when Estonia officially adopted the euro as its currency. =Lithuania= In the early 1990s, George Selgin, Joseph Sinkey Jr., and Kurt Schuler began working with Elena Leontjeva of the Lithuanian Free Market Institute (LFMI) on a reform proposal for Lithuania's central bank. Later, Hanke also began collaborating with the LFMI during regular visits to Vilnius. Having witnessed the positive effects of neighboring Estonia's currency board, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas ≈†le≈æeviƒçius, met with Hanke and his wife Liliane over lunch in January 1994 to discuss the possibility of a currency reform package for Lithuania. During that meeting, ≈†le≈æeviƒçius appointed Hanke a State Counselor ‚Äì a cabinet-level appointment ‚Äì and tasked him with designing a currency board system for Lithuania. The LFMI immediately arranged for Hanke and Schuler to publish a book in Lithuanian, Valiutu Taryba: Pasiulymai Lietuvai. Their book contained a currency board blueprint for the country. This measure was adopted in April 1994, linking the Lithuanian litas to the German mark at a fixed exchange rate. Following the introduction of the euro, the litas was linked to the euro, until January 1, 2015, when Lithuania officially adopted the euro as its currency. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= Influenced by the 1991 Hanke-Schuler book proposing a currency board for Yugoslavia,Cosic, Sabine. \\"U.S. Money Guru Urges Currency Board for Bosnia.\\" Reuters Financial Service [Sarajevo] 16 Dec. 1996: n. pag. Print. the 1995 Dayton Agreement required Bosnia and Herzegovina to employ a currency board for at least six years. In the aftermath of the Yugoslav civil war, local officials and an IMF team set about to create a central bank for Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the principles of a currency board. Hanke began serving as a special adviser to the U.S. Government in December 1996 and was tasked with ensuring that the central bank law resulted in a currency board system that was as orthodox as possible. Shortly after his appointment, Hanke published a critique of the IMF currency board proposal. Warren Coats, a key member of the IMF team discussed Hanke's involvement at length in the 2007 book. In a section of the book titled \\"Steve Hanke\\" Coats recounts: =Indonesia= In August 1997, upon urging from the International Monetary Fund, Indonesia adopted a floating exchange rate for its currency, the rupiah. In the ensuing months, the rupiah weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar. Inflation in Indonesia began to accelerate, sparking food riots across the country. In February 1998, Indonesian President Suharto invited Hanke to serve as his economic adviser. On the day of Hanke's appointment as Special Counselor and a member of Indonesia's Economic and Monetary Resilience Council, the rupiah appreciated by 28% against the U.S. dollar. During his time as Suharto's adviser, Hanke had an unprecedented level of access to the Indonesian President and even played a role in the dismissal of Indonesia's Central Bank Governor. Hanke recommended that Indonesia institute an orthodox currency board, linking the rupiah to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate. Hanke supported the reforms contained in the IMF's package. But, he argued that the IMF's program would fail unless it was coupled with a currency board arrangement. Hanke referred to his alternative reform package for Indonesia as \\"IMF Plus.\\" It garnered the support of notable economists, including Gary Becker, Rudiger Dornbusch, Milton Friedman, Merton Miller, Robert Mundell, and Sir Alan Walters. Hanke was also named one of the twenty- five most influential people in the world by World Trade Magazine during this time. In 1998, during his State of the Nation address, Suharto announced his intention to adopt Hanke's currency board proposal. This plan was met with opposition by the governments of Germany, Japan, and Singapore, among others. Economists including Nouriel Roubini and Paul Krugman also entered the fray with criticism of Hanke's proposal. The fiercest resistance, however, came from the IMF and from U.S. President Bill Clinton ‚Äì who threatened to withdraw $43 billion in aid if Indonesia adopted Hanke's proposal.Blustein, P (1998). \\"Currency dispute threatens Indonesia's bailout: Clinton backs IMF in pressing Suharto not to change country's monetary system,\\" Washington Post, 14 February. Later, officials including former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and former Australian Prime Minister Paul KeatingAgence France Presse (1999) Former Aussie PM says US used Asia crisis to oust Suharto, 11 November. conceded that criticism of Hanke's proposal did not stem from opposition to the economics of Hanke's proposal, but rather out of concern that a stable rupiah would thwart U.S.-led efforts to oust Suharto. As Nobel Laureate Merton Miller recalled in 1999, the objection to Hanke's proposal was \\"‚Ä¶not that it wouldn't work but that it would, and if it worked, they would be stuck with Suharto.\\"Tyson, J. L. (1999) 'Dollar Diplomacy' rises again as foreign-policy tool. Christian Science Monitor, 10 February. Under intense international pressure, Suharto ultimately reversed course and abandoned Hanke's \\"IMF Plus\\" proposal. On May 21, 1998, amid continued currency problems, as well as protests and reports of a brewing military coup, Suharto resigned as President of Indonesia. =Montenegro= In 1999, Hanke and Montenegrin economist ≈Ωeljko Bogetiƒá, who was an economist at the IMF at the time, wrote Crnogorska marka, a book published in Montenegro, proposing an orthodox currency board for Montenegro, which was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Montenegro would issue a Montenegrin \\"marka\\" to replace the Yugoslav dinar.Zeljko Bogetic and Steve H. Hanke. Cronogorska Marka. Podgorica, Montenegro: Antena M, 1999 (Serbo-Croatian). Later that year in July 1999, Hanke was appointed State Counselor ‚Äì a cabinet-level position ‚Äì and began advising Montenegrin President Milo ƒêukanoviƒá on issues including currency reform. After assessing the political and economic realities on the ground, Hanke advised ƒêukanoviƒá that Montenegro should abandon the faltering Yugoslav dinar and adopt a foreign currency, the German mark, as its own. This process is known as dollarization. In 1999, Montenegro was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, along with Serbia. ƒêukanoviƒá began pursuing Hanke's dollarization proposal for both economic and political reasons. In addition to providing relief from high inflation, dollarization also promised Montenegro the ability to pursue economic ‚Äì and ultimately political ‚Äì independence from Serbia. In late 1999, Montenegro introduced the German mark as an official currency. In late 2000, the Yugoslav dinar was officially dropped, making the Deutsche mark the sole legal tender in Montenegro. =Ecuador= Hanke was also an early proponent of currency boards, and later, dollarization in Ecuador. In 1995, Hanke and Kurt Schuler published a currency board blueprint in Spanish that was widely circulated in Ecuador. In May 1996, Hanke traveled to Ecuador to encourage then-presidential candidate Abdal√° Bucaram to pursue a currency board for Ecuador. Shortly thereafter, Bucaram raised the idea of a currency board while on the campaign trail. Following Bucaram's election, Hanke presented a dollarization proposal to members of the Ecuadorian government. But, by February 1997, Bucaram had been removed from office on insanity charges, and the dollarization idea lay dormant. However, in 1999, Ecuador's currency, the sucre, collapsed, losing 75% of its value against the U.S. dollar from the start of 1999 until the first week of January 2000. Shortly thereafter, Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad resurrected the dollarization idea. On January 9, 2000, he announced that Ecuador would abandon the sucre and officially adopt the U.S. dollar, putting an end to Ecuador's high inflation. In 2001, Hanke was appointed Adviser to Ecuador's Minister of Finance and Economy, to assist with the implementation of dollarization. In 2003, Hanke was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Arts, Honoris Causa by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, and in 2004, he was named Professor Asociado by the Universidad del Azuay in Cuenca, Ecuador, in honor of his reform efforts in Ecuador and scholarship on dollarization. Currency and commodity trading Hanke has been trading commodities and currencies for over 60 years. He has also trained a number of Johns Hopkins students who have gone on to successful careers in finance. He is Chairman Emeritus of the Friedberg Mercantile Group, Inc. in Toronto. During the 1990s, he served as President of Toronto Trust Argentina (TTA) in Buenos Aires. It was the world best performing mutual fund in 1995. Hanke also serves on the supervisory board of AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group, N.V., which was the best performing stock on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 2017, with its market capitalization increasing by 201%. In May 2019, Hanke was appointed Chairman of AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group's Supervisory Board. In the past, he has served on the Board of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the National Bank of Kuwait's International Advisory Board, which was chaired by Sir John Major. In 1995, during the Mexican Tequila Crisis, many investors were shying away from Argentine investments. Relying on his deep understanding of the Convertibility System, Hanke bet against the market and had TTA fully invested in Argentine peso-denominated bonds.Hanke, Steve H. \\"Arbitrage in Argentina,\\" Forbes, December 19, 1994. As a result, TTA was the world's best performing mutual fund in 1995, with a 79.25% increase. Hanke has taken several other notable successful trading positions during his career. For example, in late 1985, he was among the first to correctly predict that oil would fall below $10 per barrel, and in 1993, he joined a successful speculative attack on the French franc, which illicited an article in Paris Match, Scenario-fiction Pour Une Journ√©e De Cocagne: Hunt, Hanke, Goldsmith Tsutsumi Et Les Autres.... In 1998, under Hanke's leadership, Friedberg Mercantile Group, Inc. was one of the few trading shops to predict the devaluation of the Russian ruble. Hanke predicted that the devaluation would occur after mid-year, and the ruble collapsed shortly thereafter, on August 17, 1998.Hanke, Steve H. \\"Russia's Rickety Ruble,\\" Friedberg's Commodity and Currency Comments, January 11, 1998. Hanke has also worked as an expert witness in financial litigation, specializing in derivatives cases. In the past, he was a principal at Chicago Partners (now Navigant Consulting). In 1994, Hanke, his then-post-doctoral student Christopher Culp, and Nobel Laureate Merton Miller waded into the debate over the collapse of Metallgesellschaft AG. Although not officially involved in the case, Hanke, Culp, and Miller made headlines when they revealed that Metallgesellschaft's oil futures hedge was sound, and that it was Deutsche Bank who was responsible for the collapse of the $1.3 billion position.

Criticism In the past, Hanke has come under fire for his advocacy of currency board systems, particularly from local government officials in countries where he has worked as an adviser, as well as from rival economists. For example, former Bulgarian bureaucrat Krasimir Angarski who was tasked with the introduction of the currency board has contested the often repeated claim that Hanke is the \\"father of the Bulgarian currency board\\" and has added that Hanke had no knowledge of the Currency Board law because Angarski refused to provide him the manuscript he was working on. Angarski's claim is contradicted by the fact that Hanke first proposed a currency board for Bulgaria in 1991, with his book \\"Teeth for the Bulgarian Lev: A Currency Board Solution.\\" Hanke later helped bring about its adoption in 1997, when he served as an adviser to President Petar Stoyanov. In July 2013, Hanke's work on the Bulgarian currency board was praised by Bulgarian Prime Minister, Plamen Oresharski, as well as by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, which in 2013 awarded Hanke the degree Doctor honoris causa. Then in 2015, the Varna Free University awarded Hanke another degree, Doctor honoris causa, in recognition of his currency reform efforts in Bulgaria. In 2018, Hanke received another Doctorate Honoris Causa from the D.A. Tsenov Academy of Economics in the same recognition. In December 2013, the Bulgarian newspaper Trud published an expos√© refuting Angarski's claims and revealing that the Bulgarian National Audit Office had used official resources to propagate Angarski's claims. The head of the Bulgarian National Audit Office, Valeri Dimitrov, was subsequently dismissed. In the article \\"Rupiah Rasputin\\" written in 1998 for Fortune, Paul Krugman presented Hanke as \\"a self-promoter whose image as a successful country doctor has been pumped up by resume inflation.\\" and accused him of fraudulently claiming that he is an adviser to former Argentine Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo: \\"Cavallo himself tells a different story, though. He claims Hanke first became involved three years after the board was established, when he volunteered his services as a publicist.\\". Krugman additionally claimed that creating a currency board in Indonesia \\"was probably a bad idea right now\\", because it would interfere with payments for imports or debt service. During the 1989-91 period, Hanke worked closely with Congressman Jos√© Mar√≠a Ibarbia and his colleagues (the so-called Alsogaray faction) in the Argentine Congress to develop a blueprint for a currency board system. That blueprint was published in Buenos Aires, \\"Banco central o caja de conversi√≥n?,\\"and contains a preface written by Jos√© Mar√≠a Ibarbia.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1979 to 1988, and a senior cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1981 to 1988. Education The son of Henry Schroeder and Anna Braun, he was educated at Mennonite Collegiate Institute Gretna, Manitoba, the University of Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba. Career He worked as a lawyer before entering public life, and was a member of the Manitoba Securities Commission as well as serving as a Vice-Chairman of the Manitoba Public Utilities Board. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in a 1972 by-election in the Winnipeg riding of Wolseley, finishing third against Manitoba Liberal Party leader Izzy Asper. In 1967, he married Leona Esther Thiesson. Schroeder contested another by-election in 1979, this time in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Rossmere, recently vacated by former Premier Edward Schreyer upon his appointment at Governor General of Canada. The election was surprisingly close, with Schroeder defeating Progressive Conservative Harold Piercy by only 230 votes. Following his victory, Schroeder supported Howard Pawley's successful bid to become party leader. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the provincial election of 1981. The NDP formed a majority government following this election, and Schroeder was appointed Minister of Finance and Minister of Labour and Manpower on November 30, 1981, also carrying responsibility for the Civil Service Commission and Civil Service Superannuation Board and the administration of Pension Benefits Act and Public Servants Insurance Act. On July 19, 1982, he was relieved of all cabinet responsibilities except for the Finance portfolio. Other jobs While retaining Finance, he also served as Chairman of the Treasury Board from July 28, 1982, to November 4, 1983, and as minister responsible for Manitoba Data Services from August 20, 1982, to November 4, 1983. On November 4, 1983, he was named Minister of Crown Investments and given responsibility for the Civil Service a second time. On January 5, 1984, he was also given responsibility for the Manitoba Development Corporation Act. He was relieved of his Civil Service responsibilities on January 30, 1985. 1986 election In the provincial election of 1986, he defeated Tory candidate Harold Neufeld by 527 votes. Following the election, on April 17, 1986, he was relieved of the Finance portfolio, retained in the Crown Investments portfolio and also named Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology. From May 20 to August 29, 1986, he also served as Minister of Energy and Mines, responsible for Manitoba Hydro. On February 4, 1987, he was relieved of the Crown Investments portfolio and given responsibility for the Manitoba Development Corporation. Finally, on September 21, 1987, he was given the additional portfolio of Attorney General. The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988, and Schroeder lost to Neufeld by 526 votes in the election which followed.  Career after politics  Schroeder was appointed as the Chair of Manitoba Hydro in 2000, by the NDP government of Gary Doer. During his time as chairman, wind power was incorporated into the utility's power production. Shroeder retired as chairman in February 2012.

Other programming languages, while claiming to be simpler, require programmers to reinvent in a haphazard way a significant amount of needed functionality that is present in Lisp as a standard, time-proven, base. It can also be interpreted as a satiric critique of systems that include complex, highly configurable sub-systems.Greenspun's Tenth Rule, does every large project include a Lisp interpreter? Rather than including a custom interpreter for some domain-specific language, Greenspun's rule suggests using a widely accepted, fully featured language like Lisp. Paul Graham also highlights the satiric nature of the concept, albeit based on real issues: The rule was written sometime around 1993 by Philip Greenspun. Although it is known as his tenth rule, there are in fact no preceding rules, only the tenth. The reason for this according to Greenspun: Hacker Robert Morris later declared a corollary, which clarifies the set of \\"sufficiently complicated\\" programs to which the rule applies: This corollary jokingly refers to the fact that many Common Lisp implementations (especially those available in the early 1990s) depend upon a low-level core of compiled C, which sidesteps the issue of bootstrapping but may itself be somewhat variable in quality, at least compared to a cleanly self-hosting Common Lisp. Software engineer Stewart Milberger then started a proof of Morris' corollary: This proof jokingly refers to the fact that Common Lisp has a relatively primitive system for partitioning symbols called 'packages' and also that there might be a Greenspun's 11, vis-a-vis C++.

History Owen Stanley Range was seen in 1849 by Captain Owen Stanley while surveying the south coast of Papua and named after him. The eastern extremity of the range is Mount Victoria , which was climbed by Sir William MacGregor in 1888, and it extends as far west as Mount Thynne and Lilley. But the name is generally used to denote the whole of the chain of the Papuan Peninsula, from Mount Chapman to the south-eastern end of the island, and to include Mount Albert Edward which is really separated from it by the Wharton Chain. Geography Jungle clad mountains of the Owen Stanley Range in Central Papua New Guinea. The range is flanked by broken and difficult country, particularly on the south-western side. There are few practicable passes, the easiest being the famous Kokoda Track which crosses the range between Port Moresby and Buna and was in use for more than 50 years as a regular overland mail-route. Another route used by the 900 men of the US 2nd Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Division, was the Kapa Kapa Trail, parallel to but to the southeast of the Kokoda Track. They took nearly five weeks to cover the track over extraordinarily difficult jungle terrain, from 14 October to 20 November 1942. Vehicular roads, though not impossible, would be very difficult and expensive to construct. In fact one was constructed during World War II crossing from Wau in the north to Bulldog in the south and known as the Bulldog Track. It was largely due to the impossibility of transporting heavy equipment across the range that the Japanese failed to secure Port Moresby as a base early in 1942. The mountains are rough and precipitous, with occasional fertile plateaux which are occupied by native food-gardens.

History  Dredging for gold was begun on 21 March 1932, with the whole of the 1,100 ton dredge (No 1 dredge) transported to the field in pieces by air from the port city of Lae. The largest single part was the main tumbler shaft, 12 feet long and weighing 6,870 pounds. Construction of No 2 dredge was underway before No 1 dredge was completed. In all eight dredges were constructed and operated, the last going into operations in 1939. Dredging operations were interrupted by the war in 1941, and were not resumed until six years later. On 5 February 1942 at 11am, Bulolo was bombed by five twin-engine bombers. Gold production in 1952 amounted to 122,035 ounces, valued at ¬£1,311,241, and constituted 77 per cent of the gold produced in New Guinea in that year. As the gold petered out the dredges were abandoned and they can still be found along the Bulolo river bed. Bulolo was the headquarters of a company formed to exploit the pine forests that grow in the valley. In conjunction with the milling of timber an extensive scheme of re-afforestation was undertaken to ensure perpetuity of supplies. Since the 1950s Bulolo has been connected to Lae by a vehicular road along the Bulolo and Markham River valleys.

Its 24-hour sports content included a popular news-based breakfast show, sports phone-ins, discussions and specialist programming. The station was broadcast on 252 kHz Longwave across Ireland and the United Kingdom and was also available to listeners on Sky and online. It was particularly popular on the west side of Britain and in the Republic of Ireland where the signal was strongest.  Launch  The station was launched on 11 March 2002 at 2pm as the UK's first national commercial radio station dedicated 100% to sport, providing entertaining and informative coverage of all UK football, rugby, racing, cricket and all major sporting events. TEAMtalk 252 also provided a number of specialist programmes dedicated to racing, cricket, motor racing, non-league football, business, rugby league, US sports and live coverage of the British Basketball League. TEAMtalk 252 launched with the help of former England International Teddy Sheringham and Footballers' Wives star Z√∂e Lucker, who played Tanya Turner, and although it had 19 studios and employed 100 full-time sports journalists, the newcomer made no attempt to muscle into the patch already covered by BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport. Both stations had already spent millions on buying broadcast rights for live sports commentaries, but TEAMtalk 252 said it would concentrate on news, analysis and opinion in addition to their Saturday night British Basketball League coverage. The station's biggest names included former England International Phil Neal, Jamie Broadbent who was part of Chris Evans' Virgin Radio Breakfast Show and broadcasting personality James H. Reeve. John Meek, George Riley, Jonathan Doidge, Adam Pope, Neil Henderson, John Newcombe, Simon Barlow, Tim Thornton and Al Bentley were all part of TEAMtalk 252's launch schedule. Speaking about its launch, TEAMtalk Media Group sports director Ian Holding said: \\"Sports fans will come to know TEAMtalk 252 as the only station where they can tune in and guarantee to find sport. We have a great team in place and an enviable number of sports journalists who will enable us to deliver the broadest sports coverage possible.\\"  Programming  TEAMtalk 252's programming consisted of sports talk, sports phone-ins, discussions and specialist programming 24 hours a day. The day began with the morning's sports news, debate and reaction on The Full Sports Breakfast with Jon Meek and George Riley, before the baton was passed to Jamie Broadbent and Adam Pope on It's Your Shout, who took an in-depth look at the day's sports stories and invited listeners to have their say, before James H. Reeve hosted an afternoon sports talk show with live horse racing and interviews. Neil Henderson and Jon Newcombe rounded-up the day's sports news on Drive including all the latest stories from around the United Kingdom with their team of reporters. Sportsnight, hosted by Simon Barlow and Tim Thornton then guided listeners through the evening's sporting action, before handing over to the late night team on The Final Whistle with Al Bentley and Terry 'fatty' McGeadie, the station's nightly sports phone-in. Up For It with Gavin Hamilton, Nolan Kane and Mike Cunliffe was broadcast throughout the night. On Saturday and Sunday, TEAMtalk 252 had full coverage of the weekend's sport with the latest news and scores from the ground on 252 Matchday, and also specialist programming including The Stable Breakfast, a show dedicated to horse racing, League Talk, presented by Jonathan Doidge and the only national radio sports show dedicated to rugby league, The Non League Show with Brendan Fatchett and The Business of Sport. TEAMtalk 252 also broadcast coverage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea providing unofficial off-tube commentary of matches involving England national football team and the Republic of Ireland national football team, in addition to the knockout stages. This was despite the fact that BBC Radio 5 Live held broadcast rights to the tournament, and Talksport also provided their own unofficial off-tube coverage.  Presenters  TEAMtalk 252 had a roster of regular presenters, which included: Adam Pope, Al Bentley, Brendan Fatchett, Jonathan Doidge, Nick Millard, Gavin Hamilton, George Riley, James H. Reeve, Jamie Broadbent, Jason Thornton, Jon Meek, Jon Newcombe, Mike Cunliffe, Neil Henderson, Nick \\"Bomber\\" Harris, Nolan Kane, Phil Neal, Simon Barlow, Seth Bennett, Terry 'fatty' McGeadie, John Hunt and Tim Thornton.  Audience  TEAMtalk 252's first and only set of RAJAR audience figures showed the station had 428,000 listeners a week in the first quarter of 2002. Its Irish audience figures were never measured. For the same period, rivals Talksport increased its overall weekly audience to 2.47 million, while BBC Radio 5 Live had 6.4 million listeners. Audience figures for TEAMtalk 252 were not helped by its poor signal in London and the south east of England.  Demise  TEAMtalk had a reported ¬£28 million in the bank and allocated ¬£8m to TEAMtalk 252 stating it needed to break even by 2004, but that it didn't have enough money to bid for major exclusive sporting rights. Instead the station set about quickly growing its audience around sports news, discussion shows and creative programming, but the divided TEAMtalk board was under pressure in the post tech-stock era and the costs of operating the channel became more difficult to reconcile, despite its increasing popularity and use of originated content across other channels. As a result of disagreements over the company's direction, TEAMtalk's group chairman Bill Wilson stepped down in April and by mid-May 2002. TEAMtalk 252's owners confirmed that it was in discussions with a number of parties who had expressed an interest in buying either part of or all off the TEAMtalk group. It had, a week previously, been approached by online betting business ukbetting plc with an offer of ¬£10.2m for lock, stock and barrel ‚Äî this was rejected by the TEAMtalk management. In April 2002, ¬£9.5m was written off by TEAMtalk which admitted it had over-stretched itself financially. By the end of May 2002, TEAMtalk 252's future was thrown firmly into doubt when a deal was done between the parent company TEAMtalk and previous group bidder ukbetting to take over TEAMtalk for ¬£13.7m. ukbetting appeared to be mainly interested in TEAMtalk's other sporting services including internet site TEAMtalk.com; at that time ukbetting's portfolio of websites included sports sites sportinglife.com, sportal.com and bettingzone.co.uk, as well as betting sites totalbet.com and ukbetting.com. Subsequent takeovers have added Oddschecker.co.uk, Rivals.net, Football365, Golf365, Cricket365, Planet-Rugby and Planet-F1 among others to the stable. TEAMtalk 252 closed suddenly on 31 July 2002. Staff were informed at a meeting held that morning that the station would close between 12:00 and 14:00 that day. The station ended broadcasting at 13:44 as it played the last jingle, \\"Across the UK and Ireland, this is TEAMtalk 252.\\" It went silent shortly thereafter.  Legacy: Streaming audio & FM  teamtalk.com subsequently established a business of providing streaming audio commentary services to sporting businesses, notably betting shops such as Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power. TEAMtalk also provide broadcast services for live Restricted Service Licence FM stations at sporting venues, including for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. As with most other RSL stations, these operate for a strictly limited number of days on strictly limited power, typically allowing reception only within a couple of kilometres of the venue. The RSL stations are also broadcast over the internet.

He was the first Scottish boxer to win an Olympics boxing medal when he took home the bronze in 1908. Roddin, universally known as 'Hughie', was raised in the Newbigging district of Musselburghhttp://ringnews24.com/index.php/boxing-news/boxing- history/54688-scotlands-first-olympian-.html#axzz2RNg1i0o0 in East Lothian. Hughie first came into contact with boxing through legendary Charles 'Charlie' Cotter. Cotter worked as a timekeeper, physical trainer and boxing coach and a dominant figure in Scottish boxing. Hughie rapidly won two Scottish Eastern District Featherweight Titles under Cotter's guidance. Even better was to follow in the years 1907-08, when he went on to win the Scottish Amateur Featherweight Title. He won a silver trophy in an open boxing championship at the Pavilion Theatre in Musselburgh in 1906. The building that he trained and fought in is being refurbished and used as a museum of Scottish boxing, including a display of Hugh Roddin memorabilia. Hugh Roddin won his bronze medal at the 1908 London Olympics. He was a featherweight (57 kg). They had not originally planned to include boxing in the 1908 Olympics, so it was held after all of the other events, in October. His fight was a 37 bout marathon session that started at 11:25 am and went until 10:30 pm. Because it was held after all the other events, 32 of the 42 entrants were from Great Britain, including all of the featherweight medalists. Of the ten overseas entrants, nine were defeated in their first bout. In 1911 Roddin emigrated to the United States. Roddin had a 23 win and no loss record, according to author and journalist Brian Donald, in his research for a book https://www.amazon.com/THE-FIGHT-GAME-IN-SCOTLAND/dp/1851581448 on Scottish boxing history entitled The Fight Game in Scotland. This book devotes a complete chapter to Hugh Roddin. One of the fights was held in the old Vanderbilt Athletic Club in the Ninth Ward before World War I. In an extract that appeared in 1954 in the now defunct Brooklyn News: Hughie Roddin, the great featherweight, was a real star. During a contest in Brooklyn's Vanderbilt Club he knocked out his opponent with a crushing blow in the first round. The club owners asked Roddin if he would go in with the same opponent after a 10-minute interval, Roddin agreed and knocked the same guy out again! Roddin's career in the ring ended during World War One when he served in the U.S. Army's 35th Division. On returning he ran several youth soccer teams in Brooklyn and athletics teams based at a gym he owned there. Roddin became the boxing coach at the American Legion in Rosedale, Long Island, New York and taught his nephew Harold (Sonny) and many other boys the finer points of boxing. Sonny would go from Bayside to Rosedale many a Saturday night, go to the Legion and then home. Hugh Roddin (Hugh's nephew) tells a story that when Hugh Roddin was in his late years he was approached in the park by a mugger to give up his wallet. Hugh reached into his coat as if to grab the wallet - and came out with a punch to knock the young man down. The young man was so stunned he got up and ran away. An old boxer never loses his punch is what Hugh had said. He died at the age of 66 in Brooklyn in 1954 and is buried at Long Island's National Cemetery in Farmington, New York. The boxing gloves Roddin used to win his Olympic medal now belong to Brian Donald's grandson Ruaridh. They were given to Brian Donald as a show of appreciation by Roddin's family in the US for his work on the fighter in \\"The Fight Game in Scotland\\". They are on display in the National Museum of Scotland.

Hofstadter's introduction proposes that the major political traditions in the United States, despite contentious battles, have all \\"... shared a belief in the rights of property, the philosophy of economic individualism, the value of competition ... [T]hey have accepted the economic virtues of a capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man\\". While many accounts have made political conflict central, the author proposes that a common ideology of \\"self-help, free enterprise, competition, and beneficent cupidity\\" has guided the republic since its inception. Through analyses of the ruling class in the US, Hofstadter argues that this consensus is the hallmark of political life in the US. Part of Hofstadter's project is to undermine the democratic credentials of politicians mythologized by historians, calling for reflection rather than nostalgia. Thomas Jefferson is presented in all his ambiguities, the agrarian radical whose \\"laissez-faire became the political economy of the most conservative thinkers in the country\\". Likewise, Andrew Jackson's democracy was also \\"a phase in the expansion of liberated capitalism\\", and Progressive trustbuster Theodore Roosevelt, though he \\"despised the rich\\", was at heart a conservative frightened by \\"any sign of organized power among the people\\".

According to the 2011 census, 659,115 respondents recorded their ethnicity as Greek, forming almost 99% of the 667,398 Cypriot citizens and over 78% of the 840,407 total residents of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus. These figures do not include the 29,321 citizens of Greece residing in Cyprus, ethnic Greeks recorded as citizens of other countries, or the population of Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. The majority of Greek Cypriots are members of the Church of Cyprus, an autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church within the wider communion of Orthodox Christianity. In regard to the 1960 Constitution of Cyprus, the term also includes Maronites, Armenians, and Catholics of the Latin Church (\\"Latins\\"), who were given the option of being included in either the Greek or Turkish communities and voted to join the former. History =Prehistory and antiquity= Cyprus was part of the Mycenaean civilization with local production of Mycenaean vases dating to the Late Helladic III (1400‚Äì1050 BC). The quantity of this pottery concludes that there were numerous Mycenaean settlers, if not settlements, on the island. Archaeological evidence shows that Greek settlement began unsystematically in c. 1400 BC, then steadied (possibly due to Dorian invaders on the mainland) with definite settlements established in c. 1200 BC. The close connection between the Arcadian dialect and those of Pamphylia and Cyprus indicates that the migration came from Achaea. The Achaean tribe may have been an original population of the Peloponnese, Pamphylia, and Cyprus, living in the latter prior to the Dorian invasion, and not a subsequent immigrant group; the Doric elements in Arcadian are lacking in Cypriot. Achaeans settled among the old population, and founded Salamis. The epic Cypria, dating to the 7th century BC, may have originated in Cyprus. =Middle Ages= The Byzantine era profoundly molded Greek Cypriot culture. The Greek Orthodox Christian legacy bestowed on Greek Cypriots in this period would live on during the succeeding centuries of foreign domination. Because Cyprus was never the final goal of any external ambition, but simply fell under the domination of whichever power was dominant in the eastern Mediterranean, destroying its civilization was never a military objective or necessity. The Cypriots did however endure the oppressive rule of first the Lusignans and then the Venetians from the 1190s through to 1570. King Amaury, who succeeded his brother Guy de Lusignan in 1194, was particularly intolerant of the Orthodox Church. Greek Cypriot land was appropriated for the Latin churches after they were established in the major towns on the island. In addition, tax collection was also part of the heavy oppressive attitude of the occupiers to the locals of the island, in that it was now being conducted by the Latin churches themselves. =Early modern period= Traditional costumes of (from right to left) a Christian resident of Magossa (Famagusta), a Christian woman of Magossa, and a Greek monk of the Monastery of Tchiko, near Lefke (Lefka). The Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571 replaced Venetian rule. Despite the inherent oppression of foreign subjugation, the period of Ottoman rule (1570‚Äì1878) had a limited impact on Greek Cypriot culture. The Ottomans tended to administer their multicultural empire with the help of their subject millets, or religious communities. The millet system allowed the Greek Cypriot community to survive, administered on behalf of Constantinople by the Archbishop of the Church of Cyprus. Cypriot Greeks were now able to take control of the land they had been working on for centuries. Although religiously tolerant, Ottoman rule was generally harsh and inefficient. The patriarch serving the Ottoman sultan acted as ethnarch, or leader of the Greek nation, and gained secular powers as a result of the gradual dysfunction of Ottoman rule, for instance in adjudicating justice and in the collection of taxes. Turkish settlers suffered alongside their Greek Cypriot neighbors, and the two groups together endured centuries of oppressive governance from Constantinople. A minority of Greek Cypriots converted to Islam during this period, and are sometimes referred to as \\"neo-Muslims\\" by historians.Peter Alford Andrews, Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey, Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1989, Savile, Albany Robert, Cyprus, 1878, p. 130 =Modern history= Politically, the concept of enosis ‚Äì unification with the Greek \\"motherland\\" ‚Äì became important to literate Greek Cypriots after Greece declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. A movement for the realization of enosis gradually formed, in which the Church of Cyprus played a dominant role during the Cyprus dispute. During British rule (1878‚Äì1960), the British brought an efficient colonial administration, but government and education were administered along ethnic lines, accentuating differences. For example, the education system was organized with two Boards of Education, one Greek and one Turkish, controlled by Athens and Istanbul, respectively. The resulting education emphasized linguistic, religious, cultural, and ethnic differences and ignored traditional ties between the two Cypriot communities. The two groups were encouraged to view themselves as extensions of their respective motherlands, and the development of two distinct nationalities with antagonistic loyalties was ensured. The importance of religion within the Greek Cypriot community was reinforced when the Archbishop of the Church of Cyprus, Makarios III, was elected the first president of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960. For the next decade and a half, enosis was a key issue for Greek Cypriots, and a key cause of events leading up to the 1974 coup, which prompted the Turkish invasion and occupation of the northern part of the island. Cyprus remains divided today, with the two communities almost completely separated. Many Greek Cypriots, most of whom lost their homes, lands and possessions during the Turkish invasion, emigrated mainly to the UK, USA, Australia, South Africa and Europe. There are today estimated to be 335,000 Greek Cypriot emigrants living in Great Britain. The majority of the Greek Cypriots in Great Britain currently live in England; there is an estimate of around 3,000 in Wales and 1,000 in Scotland. By the early 1990s, Greek Cypriot society enjoyed a high standard of living. Economic modernization created a more flexible and open society and caused Greek Cypriots to share the concerns and hopes of other secularized West European societies. The Republic of Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, officially representing the entire island, but suspended for the time being in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. Population Ethnic distribution in 1973. Gold denotes land with Greek Cypriots, purple shows Turkish Cypriot enclaves, and red denotes British bases. The pink areas are administered by Greek Cypriots. Greeks in Cyprus number 659,115, according to the 2011 Cypriot census. There is a notable community of Cypriots and people of Cypriot descent in Greece. In Athens, the Greek Cypriot community numbers ca. 55,000 people. There is also a large Greek Cypriot diaspora, particularly in the United Kingdom. =Diaspora= Culture =Cuisine= Cypriot cuisine, as with other Greek cuisine, was imprinted with the spices and herbs made common as a result of extensive trade links within the Ottoman Empire. Names of many dishes came to reflect the sources of the ingredients from the many lands under the Ottoman rule. Coffee houses pervasively spread throughout the island into all major towns and countless villages. =Language= The everyday language of Greek Cypriots is Cypriot Greek, a dialect of Modern Greek. It shares certain characteristics with varieties of Crete, the Dodecanese and Chios, as well as those of Asia Minor. Greek Cypriots are generally educated in Standard Modern Greek, though they tend to speak it with an accent and preserve some Cypriot Greek grammar.

At the 1908 Olympic Games he became Olympic champion, defeating Matt Wells along the way. He also became the British and European amateur champion, Biography Born in Edmonton, Middlesex, he first became a boxer at Eton Mission Boxing Club. Making use of the facilities provided by Eton Mission, he also became proficient on the parallel bars. In his early 20s, Fred incurred serious damage to his knee after an incident on his motorcycle. Fred declined the surgeon's advice to amputate and determined to regain his fitness. Subsequently, from that time to the Olympics in 1908 he never figured in any title challenges. After the Games, Grace went on to win four ABA lightweight titles between 1909 and 1920. However, whilst in his prime, boxing was banned from the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm and WW1 canceled out the Olympics of 1916, therefore Grace was unable to defend his title. By 1920 he was 36 years old and at the Olympics in Antwerp he won just one bout in the lightweight class before being eliminated by the eventual winner of the title, Samuel Mosberg, of the US. Grace worked as a heating engineer for most of his life and retired in 1949. He died on 23 July 1964 at Ilford, Essex, aged 80, after being struck by a car while out walking.

His 1960 work The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to DescartesLater editions are enlarged and so have slightly different titles introduced one previously unrecognized influence on Western thought in the seventeenth century, the Pyrrhonian Scepticism of Sextus Empiricus. Popkin also was an internationally acclaimed scholar on Christian millenarianism and Jewish messianism. Life Richard Popkin was born in Manhattan to author Zelda Popkin and her husband Louis Popkin, who together ran a small public relations firm. He earned his bachelor's degree and, in 1950, his Ph.D. from Columbia University. He taught at American universities, including the University of Connecticut, The University of Iowa, Harvey Mudd College, the University of California, San Diego, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of California Los Angeles. He was visiting professor at University of California Berkeley, Brandeis University, Duke University, Emory University, Tel Aviv University, and was Distinguished Professor at the City University of New York. Popkin was the founding director of the International Archives of the History of Ideas. Among his honors, Popkin was awarded the Nicholas Murray Butler Medal by Columbia University and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was president emeritus and founding editor of the Journal of the History of Philosophy. Richard Popkin spent his later years living in Pacific Palisades, California. He died of emphysema in Los Angeles in April 2005. His papers have been archived at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at UCLA. Family Professor Popkin is survived by Juliet (n√©e Greenstone), whom he married in 1944, and two of their three children, the historian Jeremy Popkin (b. 1948) and his younger daughter, Susan Popkin (b. 1961). Margaret Popkin (1950‚Äì2005) was a prominent civil rights lawyer and activist, known particularly for her work in El Salvador during the civil war of the 1980s. Works Popkin published many textbooks on philosophy, some with Avrum Stroll. He was editor and translator of selections from Pierre Bayle‚Äôs Historical and Critical Dictionary (1965). His last book, Disputing Christianity (2007), was completed posthumously by his son Jeremy. Popkin published two autobiographical writings: Intellectual Autobiography: Warts and All in The Sceptical Mode in Modern Philosophy. Essays in Honor of Richard H. Popkin, 1988, pp. 103‚Äì149, and a continuation: Introduction: Warts and All Part 2, in Everything Connects: In Conference with Richard H. Popkin. Essays in His Honor, 1999, pp. XI-LXXVI. Beyond his philosophical works, he is noted for writing The Second Oswald (1966), questioning the Warren Report lone gunman explanation of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Popkin's theory was that a look-alike of Lee Harvey Oswald was the actual assassin of Kennedy. Selected bibliography ; Works authored * The History of Scepticism from Savonarola to Bayle.

Scott posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Biography Scott was born August 10, 1889 in Indianapolis, Indiana. Appointed to the Naval Academy in 1907, he graduated four years later and received his commission as ensign in March 1912. During 1911-13, Ensign Scott served in the battleship , then served in destroyers and related duty. In December 1917, he was executive officer of when she was sunk by a German submarine and was commended for his performance at that time. During the rest of World War I, Lieutenant Scott had duty in the Navy Department and as Naval Aide to President Woodrow Wilson. In 1919, while holding the temporary rank of lieutenant commander, he was in charge of a division of Eagle Boats (PE) and commanded Eagle PE-2 and Eagle PE-3. During the first years of the 1920s, Norman Scott served afloat in destroyers and in the battleship and ashore in Hawaii. From 1924 to 1930, he was assigned to the staff of Commander Battle Fleet and as an instructor at the Naval Academy. He commanded the destroyers and in the early 1930s, then had further Navy Department duty and attended the Naval War College's Senior Course. After a tour as executive officer of the light cruiser , Commander Scott was a member of the U.S. Naval Mission to Brazil in 1937‚Äì39. Following promotion to the rank of captain, he was commanding officer of the heavy cruiser until shortly after the United States entered World War II in December 1941. Captain Scott was assigned to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations during the first months of 1942. After becoming a rear admiral in May, he was sent to the south Pacific, where he commanded a fire support group during the invasion of Guadalcanal and Tulagi in early August. Rear Admiral Scott continued to lead surface task units for the next three months, as the campaign to hold Guadalcanal intensified. He was present during the Battle of Savo Island on the cruiser , albeit miles from the action. In September 1942, he was named commander of Task Force 64, a mixed Cruiser-Destroyer surface warfare unit. The combat-minded, pugilistic Scott thoroughly trained and drilled his combat group in gunnery, maneuvers, and night fighting .Neptune's Inferno: The U.S. Navy at Guadalcanal (Bantam hardcover, 2011). This training paid off when, on 11‚Äì12 October 1942, he led his force to victory in the Battle of Cape Esperance, the U.S. Navy's first surface victory of the campaign. He maneuvered his ships so as to successfully perform the classically desired \\"Crossing the T\\" of the opposing Japanese force. A month later, on November 13, he was second-in-command during the initial night action of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Many felt, at the time and with hindsight, that the fighting-minded and experienced Scott would have made a more effective overall commander of the US force than inexperienced first-in-command Daniel J. Callaghan did, and that Scott perhaps would not have made some of the mistakes that Callaghan did. During that engagement, Rear Admiral Norman Scott was killed in action when the bridge of his flagship, the light cruiser , was inadvertently struck by gunfire from Callaghan's flagship, the heavy cruiser , which joined with an enemy torpedo to fatally damage the Atlanta. For his \\"extraordinary heroism and conspicuous intrepidity\\" in the October and November battles, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor. As with his fellow Admiral Callaghan, Admiral Scott was buried at sea. Namesakes The U.S. Navy ships , 1943‚Äì1973, and , 1981‚Äì1998, were named in honor of Rear Admiral Scott. The Scott Center Annex, adjacent to Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth Virginia, is named for him. The Norman Scott Natatorium at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland is named for him for being instrumental in introducing intercollegiate swimming to the Naval Academy as a midshipmen. Norman Scott Road on Naval Base San Diego and Training Support Center Great Lakes also honors his memory. Medal of Honor citation Rear Admiral Norman Scott, USN.

Description  Spiff is one of Calvin's many alter egos, imaginary personae who have solo adventures (without Hobbes's company) in fantasy worlds which usually have some form of indirect connection with his home or school life. He travels through the galaxy in a red flying saucer with a bubble canopy. In all but one strip, the saucer is tiny, with just enough room for Spiff and apparently little else. Yet, the craft is equipped with an astounding array of weapons, detectors and propulsion devices. Spiff wears square glasses, or goggles, whose front openings change their shape according to his emotions. The galaxy is a cruel place where Spiff is often zapped by ferocious and disgusting aliens (who, in reality, are really people such as Calvin's parents, Miss Wormwood, etc.) or stranded on a desert planet or both. He has a raygun, known by various fantastic names, but in reality, it is merely a water pistol.  Background  The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book provides background on Spiff's character. Watterson first conceived an earlier version of Spiff when he was taking a high school German class, producing a two-page comic titled \\"Raumfahrer Rolf\\". When he was in college he reworked the strip and renamed his hero \\"Spaceman Mort\\". Later on, after finishing college, he came up with the name Spaceman Spiff and made what he hoped was a professional strip with Spiff as a hero. There was little resemblance to the Calvin-Spiff character: The early Spiff was a \\"diminutive loudmouth\\" with a Chaplin moustache who explored space in a dirigible with his sidekick Fargle. The newspaper syndicates all rejected this early strip, and the present Spiff was finally born as one of the many imaginary alter egos of Calvin when the Calvin and Hobbes strip took off. Early in the strip's career, the alien planets Watterson invented were, in his words, \\"rather generic\\". As his work matured, Watterson brought the Spiff saga in line with his principle that \\"Things are funner when they're specific, rather than generalized\\", basing his alien landscapes on the rock formations of southern Utah, as well as the landscapes within Krazy Kat. Gradually, the monsters also took on more detail, becoming more than blobs of slime. The vocabulary, and in particular Spiff's array of high-tech gadgetry, offered a caricature of the \\"Science\\" found in many science fiction books and TV series.  Influences  Watterson himself described Spaceman Spiff as a parody of Flash Gordon. The grand \\"space opera\\" style of Spiff's adventures may also point to a spoof of Star Trek and Star Wars; there is very little cyberpunk in Watterson's oeuvre. Since all the Spiff adventures have a lone protagonist playing with reality, they resemble the early work of Philip K. Dick and that of other writers who featured lone individuals going to the edge of their perceived world. In the final years of Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson began to show an interest in information technology, often pitting the progressive and computer-savvy Calvin against his reactionary father, who comments, \\"It's bad enough to have a telephone.\\" Watterson's satire of the personal computer and its effects spilled over into the Spaceman Spiff strips.  Other adventures  Calvin had many other science fiction adventures, in addition to the Spiff episodes. Some of them delved farther than the Spiff stories in exploring the aesthetics of science fiction and the nature of id and otherness.

Adapted from a comedy sketch that first appeared on The Chris Rock Show,Original Appearance in the Chris Rock Show the character Pootie Tang is a satire of the stereotyped characters who appeared in old blaxploitation films. The title character's speech, which vaguely resembles pidgin, is mostly unintelligible to the audience, but the other characters in the film have no problem understanding him. Plot Pootie Tang, born in \\"a small town outside Gary, Indiana\\", is portrayed as a ladies' man who is \\"too cool for words\\", even as a young child. His life is marked by the deaths of his mother \\"Momma Dee\\", and shortly thereafter his father \\"Daddy Tang\\", who dies after being mauled by a gorilla during his shift at the steel mill (the third time someone had suffered that particular fate). Just before Daddy Tang's death, Pootie inherits his father's belt and is told that (as long as he has right on his side) he can \\"whoop anyone's ass with just that belt.\\" As a young adult, Pootie Tang rises to fame and becomes well known for a variety of reasons. He sings in nightclubs, stars in public service announcements for children, produces top-of-the-charts music hits, and generally defeats wrongdoers with the power of his belt. Dick Lecter, the chief operating officer of multi- industrial conglomerate LecterCorp, learns of Pootie Tang's positive influence on society ‚Äî and his negative influence on LecterCorp's bottom line. After his henchmen and a villain named Dirty Dee are sent away by Pootie's friends, Lecter encourages his right-hand lady, Ireenie, to seduce Pootie Tang into signing an agreement with LecterCorp that would stop Pootie Tang's influence on America's children. Pootie Tang falls for Ireenie's tricks and subsequently falls apart. His status as pop culture icon is destroyed, and he engages on a quest to \\"find [him]self\\". This journey is encouraged by his friend Biggie Shorty, who promises to wait for Pootie to return to her and to the rest of society. Pootie moves to a farm where the local sheriff decides Pootie should start dating his daughter. After his single corn stalk dies, he has a vision of Daddy Tang and Momma Dee. Daddy Tang reveals that there is nothing special about Pootie's belt; instead, Pootie must fight evil with the goodness that is inside him. After dealing with Dirty Dee and his henchman Froggy (as well as getting his belt back), Pootie realizes he must move back to the city and fight crime once again. Pootie Tang returns to the city just as Dick Lecter is unveiling the first of his new restaurant chain, Pootie's Bad Time Burgers. At a small news conference, Pootie confronts Lecter only to discover that Lecter has amassed dozens of \\"Pootie-alikes\\" who will spread the message of LecterCorp around the nation. Pootie Tang, with the help of Biggie Shorty, defeats all of these henchmen and Lecter himself. Good triumphs over evil once again, and Biggie Shorty finally gets her man: she and Pootie Tang plan to get married now that Pootie is back. Elsewhere, Dick Lecter leaves corporate life and becomes an actor, Ireenie leaves him and becomes a counselor helping at- risk teenage prostitutes, and Dirty Dee is still dirty.

According to him, Ali LeRoi was hired to extensively re-edit the film. Openly agreeing with Roger Ebert's dismissive criticism that the movie should not have even been released, C.K. has said that the finished product, though containing parts he enjoyed, was far from his own vision. Reception Critical reception was generally negative, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it an approval rating of 27% based on 44 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Based as it is on a short skit, Pootie Tang overstays its welcome.\\" Roger Ebert gave it a half-star rating, criticizing it for excessive use of vulgar language and demeaning portrayal of women, describing it as a \\"train wreck\\" and finishing his review by bluntly stating \\"This film is not in a releasable condition.\\" Nathan Rabin at The A.V. Club said Pootie Tang \\"borders on audience abuse\\" and \\"confuse[s] idiocy for absurdity and randomness for wit.\\" In 2009, fellow A.V. Club writer Scott Tobias revisited the film and included it in his New Cult Canon series, noting that \\"Pootie Tang repelled mainstream critics and audiences, but it holds an exalted status among alt-comedians and fans of subversive anti-comedy in general.\\" Kevin Murphy also praised the film in his book A Year at the Movies: Soundtrack A soundtrack containing mainstream hip hop, dance, and R&B; music was released on June 16, 2001 by Hollywood Records.

Besides the temple of Poseidon, it possessed a sacred grove of the Eumenides, altars of Athena Hippia, Demeter, Zeus, and Prometheus, together with sanctuaries of Peirithous, Theseus, Oedipus, and Adrastus. According to Greek mythology, Oedipus was buried there, as described by Sophocles, who was born there, in his Oedipus at Colonus. The natural beauties of the spot are described by Sophocles in the magnificent chorus, beginning with these words: ‚ÄúŒµ·ΩêŒØœÄœÄŒøœÖ, ŒæŒ≠ŒΩŒµ, œÑ·æ∂œÉŒ¥Œµ œáœéœÅŒ±œÇ ·ºµŒ∫ŒøœÖ œÑ·Ω∞ Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒπœÉœÑŒ± Œ≥·æ∂œÇ ·ºîœÄŒ±œÖŒªŒ± œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºÄœÅŒ≥·øÜœÑŒ± ŒöŒøŒªœâŒΩœåŒΩ. In the Athenian oligarchic revolution of 411 BCE, the oligarchs convened at the sanctuary of Poseidon Hippios at Colonus to frame their new constitution.Thuc. 8.67 The site of Colonus is at Agia Eleousa in modern Kolonos. The modern neighborhood of Kolonos is named after it. In literature * At the beginning of Oedipus at Colonus by the playwright Sophocles, a character named Xenos describes the area to the blind outcast Oedipus. He claims that the area is sacred to the sea-god Poseidon and to Prometheus, the Titan who brought fire to mankind. It is also sacred to a former ruler and charioteer named Colonus, for whom the region was named and who is now venerated as a hero-god. Later, Oedipus prays to the Eumenides to allow him to take refuge there. At the end of the play, Oedipus' death and burial are described, but his gravesite is to be kept secret to avoid desecration. * The Gospel at Colonus by Lee Breuer is a modern adaptation of Sophocles' play employing gospel music.

It takes its name from the name of a manor in the parish of Barham in Kent, England that was named after the broom plant. It was named by English surveyors. The earliest settlers to this region were brought from New Hampshire by the Quaker leader, Nicholas Austin in the 1790s. The county was formed in 1855 from parts of Stanstead, Shefford and Missisquoi counties. The county is located in the Eastern Townships, one of the 12 regions of Quebec. The county lies in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Its eastern half is rolling countryside while its western half is part of the Richelieu River plains. The county is roughly an upside-down \\"L\\" shape, bound on the south by the Canada‚ÄìUS border (along 45¬∞ for 17.5 km from 72¬∞ 15‚Ä≤ W in Lake Memphremagog to 72¬∞ 41.5‚Ä≤ W), in the east by in part Lake Memphremagog and Stanstead County, in the north by Shefford County (45¬∞ 20‚Ä≤ N for 48 km from 72¬∞ 15‚Ä≤ W to 72¬∞ 52‚Ä≤ W) and in the west by Rouville and Missisquoi counties. The county is divided into five townships, three in the north and two in the south. The townships in the north are, from east to west, the Township of Bolton, the Township of Brome and the Township of Farnham. The southern townships are the Township of Potton in the east and the Township of Sutton in the west. The county seat is Knowlton in the Township of Brome. Notable physical features of the county include Mount Brome in the northwestern corner of the Township of Brome and the much larger Mount Sutton in the Township of Sutton, and Brome Lake in the eastern part of the Township of Brome, which flows into the Yamaska River, site of a famous duck farm. Along Lake Memphremagog in the Township of Potton are three mountains, from north to south, Mount Sugar Loaf, the larger Mount Owl's Head, and Mount Bear. Owl's Head and Sutton are well-known ski hills. In the early 1980s the county was abolished and the western half was transferred to the new Regional County Municipality of Brome-Missisquoi and the eastern half was transferred to the Regional County Municipality of Memphr√©magog. A small part in the northwest were transferred to the Regional County Municipality of La Haute-Yamaska.

In 2000, Ann Summers acquired the Knickerbox brand, a label with an emphasis on more comfortable and feminine underwear, while the Ann Summers-labelled products tend to be more erotic in style. The chain had an annual turnover of ¬£117.3 million in 2007‚Äì2008. History The company was named after Annice Summers, the female secretary of the male founder, Michael Caborn-Waterfield. Annice Summers, who was born Annice Goodwin in 1941 but later took her stepfather's surname, left the company soon after it opened following a row with Caborn Waterfield. She went to live in Umbria, Italy, two hours from Rome, and died of cancer in October 2012. In 2000, Ann Summers acquired the underwear brand Knickerbox for an undisclosed sum. However, in 2014 they announced plans to sell the brand. =Retail= The first Ann Summers shop was opened in 1970 in Marble Arch, London, from which it grew to six shops. Ann Summers was purchased in 1971 by brothers Ralph and David Gold, who turned it from a standard sex shop into an established high street brand and lingerie boutique. In 1981, David Gold installed his daughter Jacqueline Gold (who is the current Chief Executive of Ann Summers) and she introduced the Party Plan concept. The retail operations for all of Ann Summers‚Äô shops are managed from the Head Office in Whyteleafe, Surrey, and as of December 2010 Ann Summers operates 144 retail outlets across the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and Spain. The shops offer lingerie, underwear, cosmetics, swimwear and sex toys. The stores sell 2 million Rampant Rabbits, a kind of vibrator exclusive to Ann Summers, per year. =Party Plan= Jacqueline Gold initiated the Party Plan concept in 1981. Initially, the Ann Summers parties were as much a way of circumventing regulations restricting the display of sex toys as they were a marketing tactic, but their popularity quickly grew and Ann Summers now employs over 7,500 Party Organisers, coordinated from the Head Office in Surrey. There are around 4,000 Ann Summers Parties every week in the UK. The Ann Summers parties are exclusively women-only, and include the presentation of sex toys and lingerie in the informal setting of someone's home; usually the home of one of the attendees. It can also involve the perusal of a catalogue, and often there are party games. Controversy Due to the adult nature of the business, Ann Summers has frequently faced opposition, both legal and social. For example, in 2003, they won a legal battle to advertise for employees in job centres and an ASA complaint was rejected. They have also encountered opposition to their advertising. The company received a letter of complaint from Buckingham Palace, due to a non- endorsed advert featuring the Queen. In 2003, the company's payments to party organisers were discussed by a number of media sources. In 2004, two complaints were upheld by the ASA. The ASA decided that the first ad was degrading to women, offensive and unsuitable for use as a poster. In the second case the ASA ruled that the use of a reference to the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a Cock Horse\\" was likely to attract the attention of children and that the advertisement was unsuitable for the medium in which it appeared. Ann Summers lingerie factory in Portsmouth closed in 2005, with over 50 redundancies. Additionally, Ann Summers in Perth, Scotland, was forced to close after the local people complained about the store (mostly from parents embarrassed by questions raised by their children), which also led to other problems with the store. Perth was originally the only UK town where an Ann Summers store failed to take off. However, in May 2007 the Middleton Grange, Hartlepool store which opened in November 2005 was closed after less than two years of trading due to poor sales. In 2006, Muslim groups complained about the release of a blow up doll named Mustafa Shag, claiming that the doll was offensive to Muslims as Mustafa was one of the names given to the Prophet Mohamed. In 2007, the company faced legal issues with Apple Inc due to its release of an electronic add-on to music players called the iGasm. The company has not backed down despite cease and desist orders by Apple. Also, a former director, who is now a Beate Uhse AG employee is pursuing a libel claim against Jacqueline Gold. An advert was banned from the London Underground in the same year. In 2010, Ann Summers‚Äô Halloween advert was banned by the Radio Advertising Clearance Centre, which decided the advert used \\"fairly overt sexual references in terms of sound effects.\\" In 2011 an advertising campaign which featured a pastiche of a Marks and Spencer advert was withdrawn after a threat of legal action by M&S.; References External links * Ann Summers website * Jacqueline Gold website * Gold Group International website Clothing retailers of the United Kingdom Sex shops Clothing companies established in 1970 Retail companies established in 1970 Companies based in Surrey Clothing retailers of England Clothing companies of the United Kingdom Clothing companies of England Lingerie brands English brands Clothing brands of the United Kingdom ","title":"Ann Summers"},{"id":"1210949","text":"Male circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin (prepuce) from the human penis. The ethics of non-therapeutic circumcision being imposed on unconsenting minors (babies and children) has been a source of ongoing controversy. Some medical associations take the position that the parents should determine what is in the best interest of the infant or child. Others say that circumcision is an infringement of the child's autonomy and should be deferred until he is capable of making the decision himself.Non-Therapeutic Circumcision of Male Minors. Utrecht: Royal Dutch Medical Association, 2010. Medical bodies =Australia and New Zealand= upright=0.3 upright=0.3 The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (2010) released a statement indicating that neonatal male circumcision is \\"generally considered an ethical procedure\\", provided that 1) the child's decision makers, typically the parents, are acting in best interest of child and have been given full knowledge and 2) the procedure is performed by a competent provider, with sufficient analgesia, and does not unnecessarily harm the child or have substantial risks.Circumcision of Male Infants. Royal Australasian College of Physicians. September 2010. They argue that parents should be allowed to be the primary decision-makers because providers may not understand the full psychosocial benefits of circumcision. Additionally, this procedure does not present substantial harm compared to its potential benefits, so parents should be allowed full decision-making capacity as long as they are educated properly. This statement also recognizes that waiting until the boy is of sufficient age to make his own decision would better respect his autonomy, but points out that this may interfere with a child's religious inclusion that circumcision was meant to confer. With neonatal male circumcision, they acknowledge that the child may later on disagree with the parents' decision but using the same reasoning, an uncircumcised child may also disagree with his parents' decision not to have him circumcised in infancy. =Canada= upright=0.3 The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) issued a position statement on September 8, 2015, which highlighted the ethical issue surrounding the child's inability to give consent. Since children require a substituted decision maker acting in their best interests, they recommend to hold off non- medically indicated procedures, such as circumcision, until children can make their own decisions. Yet the CPS also states that parents of male newborns must receive unbiased information about neonatal circumcision, so that they can weigh specific risks and benefits of circumcision in the context of their own familial, religious and cultural beliefs. =Denmark= upright=0.3 The Danish Medical Association (L√¶geforeningen) has released a statement (2016) regarding the circumcision of boys under the age of eighteen years. The organization says that the decision to circumcise should be \\"an informed personal choice\\" that men should make for themselves in adulthood. According to Dr. Lise M√∏ller, the chairwoman of the Doctors‚Äô Association's Ethics Board, allowing the individual to make this decision himself when he is of age respects his right of self-determination. The Danish College of General Practitioners has defined non-medical circumcision as mutilation.https://ugeskriftet.dk/dmj/male-circumcision-does-not-result- inferior-perceived-male-sexual-function-systematic-review =Netherlands= upright=0.3 The Royal Dutch Medical Association (Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij tot bevordering der Geneeskunst) (KNMG) and several Dutch specialist medical societies published a statement of position regarding circumcision of male children on 27 May 2010. The KNMG argues against circumcising male minors due to lack of evidence the procedure is useful or necessary, its associated risks, and violate the child's autonomy. They recommend deferring circumcision until the child is old enough to decide for himself. The Royal Dutch Medical Association questions why the ethics regarding male genital alterations should be viewed any differently from female genital alterations, when there are mild forms of female genital alterations (like pricking the clitoral hood without removing any tissue or removing the clitoral hood altogether). They have expressed opposition to both male circumcision and all forms of female circumcision, however they do not advocate a prohibition of male circumcision (even though they argue that there are good reasons for it to be banned) and prefer that circumcisions be done by doctors instead of illegal, underground circumcisers . On the contrary, the Dutch Council on Public Health and Care does not agree with the Royal Dutch Medical Organisation and states that they wrongly do not distinguish between male and female circumcision and that they do not take into account freedom of religion and the right of parents to raise their children according their own beliefs or convictions. = Scandinavia = In 2013 children's ombudsmen from Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland, along with the Chair of the Danish Children's Council and the children's spokesperson for Greenland, passed a resolution that emphasized the decision to be circumcised should belong to the individual, who should be able to give informed consent.[] Tuesday, 1 October 2013 The Nordic Association of Clinical Sexologists supports the position of the Nordic Association of Ombudsmen who reason that circumcision violates the individual's human rights by denying the male child his ability to make the decision for himself.Statement on Non-Therapeutic Circumcision of Boys.. Nordic Association of Clinical Sexologists, Helsinki, 10 October 2013. The medical doctors at S√∏rland Hospital in Kristiansand, Southern Norway have all refused to perform circumcisions on boys, citing reasons of conscience. =United Kingdom= upright=0.3 The medical ethics committee of the British Medical Association also reviewed the ethics behind circumcision. Since circumcision has associated medical and psychological risks with no unequivocally proven medical benefits, they advise physicians to keep up with clinical evidence and only perform this procedure if it's in the child‚Äôs best interest.Committee on Medical Ethics. The law & ethics of male circumcision: guidance for doctors; June 2006 [Retrieved 25 November 2013.]. However, they acknowledge the procedure as a cultural and religious practice, which may be an important ritual for the child's incorporation into the group. They recognize that parents have the authority to make choices for their child, and they emphasize it is important for parents to act in their child's best interest. They ultimately report that views vary in their community about the benefits and risks of the procedure, and there is no clear policy for this situation. Commenting on the development of the 2003 British Medical Association guidance on circumcision, Mussell (2004) reports that debate in society is highly polarized, and he attributes it to the different faiths and cultures that make up BMA. He identifies this as a difficulty in achieving consensus within the medical ethics committee. Arguments put forward in discussions, according to Mussell, included the social and cultural benefits of circumcision, the violation of the child's rights, and the violation of the child's autonomy. Adult circumcision In a paper published June 2006, the British Medical Association Committee on Medical Ethics does not consider circumcision of an adult male to be controversial, provided that the adult is of sound mind and grants his personal consent after receiving all material information regarding the known risks, disadvantages, and potential benefits to be derived from the surgical operation. Circumcision of adults as a public health measure for the purpose of reducing the spread of HIV also involves ethical concerns such as informed consent and concerns about reducing attention paid to other measures. According to the CDC website, research has documented a significant reduction of HIV/AIDS transmission when a male is circumcised. Child circumcision In the same British Medical Association paper, circumcision of a child to treat a clear and present medical indication after a trial of conservative treatment also is not considered to be ethically questionable, provided that a suitable surrogate has granted surrogate consent after receiving all material information regarding the known risks, disadvantages, and potential benefits to be derived from the surgical operation. Criticism and revision of BMA statement The BMA statement of 2003 took the position that non-therapeutic circumcision of children is lawful in the United Kingdom. British law professors Fox & Thomson (2005), citing the House of Lords case of R v Brown, challenged this statement. They argued that consent cannot make an unlawful act lawful. The BMA issued a revised statement in 2006 and now reports the controversy regarding the lawfulness of non-therapeutic child circumcision and recommends that doctors obtain the consent of both parents before performing non- therapeutic circumcision of a male minor. The revised statement now mentions that male circumcision is generally assumed to be lawful provided that it is performed competently, is believed to be in the child's best interests, and there is valid consent from both parent or the child if it is capable of expressing a view. =United States= upright=0.3  American Academy of Pediatrics  The circumcision policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that \\"Systematic evaluation of English-language peer- reviewed literature from 1995 through 2010 indicates that preventive health benefits of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure,\\" but ultimately concluded that the decision of whether or not to circumcise should be made by parents after considering the medical benefits and risks along with \\"religious, ethical, and cultural beliefs and practices\\" and that the medical benefits are such that third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns is warranted. The policy statement also noted that the risk of complications is considerably lower when circumcision is performed during the newborn period, as opposed to when it is performed later in life. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had endorsed the American Academy of Pediatrics' circumcision policy statement. =Criticism= The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) position statement on male circumcision (2012) has attracted significant critical comment, including from the AAP itself. In a dissenting paper, Frisch et al point out \\"Circumcision fails to meet the criteria to serve as a preventive measure for UTI [...] As a preventive measure for penile cancer, circumcision also fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine [...] circumcision for HIV protection in Western countries fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine [...] Circumcision fails to meet the commonly accepted criteria for the justification of preventive medical procedures in children.\\" Frisch et all conclude that \\"The AAP report lacks a serious discussion of the central ethical dilemma with, on one side, parents‚Äô right to act in the best interest of the child on the basis of cultural, religious, and health-related beliefs and wishes and, on the other side, infant boys‚Äô basic right to physical integrity in the absence of compelling reasons for surgery. Physical integrity is one of the most fundamental and inalienable rights a child has. Physicians and their professional organizations have a professional duty to protect this right, irrespective of the gender of the child.\\" Van Howe & Svoboda (2013) criticize their statement because it failed to include important points, in accurately analyzed and interpret current medical literature, and made unsupported conclusions. Frisch et al. (2013) pointed out the difference of the AAP's statements in comparison to other Western countries, such as Canada, Australia, and various European countries. They attribute this to cultural bias since non-therapeutic male circumcision is prevalent in the United States. They also criticized the strength of the health benefits the statement had claimed, such as protection from HIV and other STIs. The American Academy of Pediatrics responded that because about half of American males are circumcised and half are not, there may be a more tolerant view concerning circumcision in the US, but that if there is any cultural ‚Äúbias‚Äù among the AAP taskforce who wrote the Circumcision Policy statement, it is much less important than the bias Frisch et al. may hold because of clear prejudices against the practice that can be found in Europe. The AAP elaborately explained why they reached conclusions regarding the health benefits of circumcision that are different from the ones reached by some of their European counterparts. American Medical Association Journal of Ethics In August 2017, the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics featured two separate articles challenging the morality of performing non-therapeutic infant circumcision. Svoboda argues against non-therapeutic circumcision. He states that this decision should be considered in the context of benefit vs risk of harm, rather than simply risk-benefit due to the non-therapeutic nature of the procedure. He states that benefits do not outweigh the risks, and also claims that foreskin removal should be considered a sexual harm. He also goes on to conclude that non-therapeutic circumcision largely violates the physician's duty to respect a patient's autonomy since many procedures take place before a patient is able to freely give consent himself. Reis and Reis's article explore the role physicians play in neonatal circumcision. They state that if physicians outline all the currently known risks and benefits of the procedure to the parents and believes the procedure is indeed medically indicated, they cannot be held accountable for any harm from the procedure. However, they still advise against physicians recommending unnecessary, irreversible surgeries, which is a category circumcision falls in frequently.  Other views  =JME symposium on circumcision, June 2004= The Journal of Medical Ethics published a \\"symposium on circumcision\\" in its June 2004 issue. The symposium published the original version (2003) of the BMA policy statement and six articles by various individuals with a wide spectrum of views on the ethicality of circumcision of male minors. In the introduction, Holm (2004) states: > \\"It is therefore very interesting that the piece of evidence we really need > to have in order to be able to assess the status of circumcision is > singularly lacking. We simply do not have valid comparative data concerning > the effects of early circumcision on adult sexual function and satisfaction. > Until such data become available, the circumcision debate cannot be brought > to a satisfactory conclusion, and there will always be a lingering suspicion > that the sometimes rather strident opposition to circumcision is partly > driven by cultural prejudices, dressed up as ethical arguments.\\" Hutson (2004) states: > \\"The most fundamental principle of surgery is that no operation should be > done if there is no disease, as it cannot be justified if the risk of the > procedure is not balanced by the risk of a disease. Even when patients have > significant disease, potentially dangerous operations can hardly be > justified if their risks are much greater than the disease itself. The > problem for routine circumcision is that since there is no disease, no > complication whatsoever can be tolerated, since the risks of the procedure > are not being balanced against the risks of any present disease.\\" Short (2004) disputes Hutson's claims and argues that male circumcision has future prophylactic benefits that make it worthwhile. He concludes: > \\"If we believe in evidence based medicine, then there can be no debate about > male circumcision; it has become a desirable option for the whole world. > Paradoxically, this simple procedure is a life saver; it can also bring > about major improvements to both male and female reproductive health. Rather > than condemning it, we in the developed world have a duty to develop better > procedures that are neither physically cruel nor potentially dangerous, so > that male circumcision can take its rightful place as the kindest cut of > all.\\" Viens (2004) contends that \\"we do not know in any robust or determinate sense that infant male circumcision is harmful in itself, nor can we say the same with respect to its purported harmful consequences.\\" He suggests that one must distinguish between practices that are grievously harmful and those that enhance a child's cultural or religious identity. He suggests that medical professionals, and bioethicists especially, \\"must take as their starting point the fact that reasonable people will disagree about what is valuable and what is harmful.\\" Hellsten (2004), however, describes arguments in support of circumcision as \\"rationalisations\\", and states that infant circumcision can be \\"clearly condemned as a violation of children‚Äôs rights whether or not they cause direct pain.\\" He argues that, to question the ethical acceptability of the practice, \\"we need to focus on child rights protection.\\" Hellsten concludes, \\"Rather, with further education and knowledge the cultural smokescreen around the real reasons for the maintenance of the practice can be overcome in all societies no matter what their cultural background. Mussell (2004) examined the process by which the BMA arrived at a position on non- therapeutic circumcision male minors, when the organisation had groups and individuals of different ethnicities, religion, culture, and widely varying viewpoints. Arguments were put forward that non-therapeutic male circumcision is a net benefit for some because it helps them to integrate in the community. Arguments were also put forward that non-therapeutic male circumcision is a net harm because it is seen as a breach of children's rights‚Äîthe right of the child to be free from physical intrusion and the right of the child to choose in the future. This argument was given emphasis by Britain's incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) into domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998. The BMA produced a document that set forth legal and ethical concerns but left the final decision on whether or not to perform a non- therapeutic circumcision to the attending physician. The last document published by the Journal of Medical Ethics in its symposium on circumcision was a reprint of the BMA statement: \\"The law and ethics of male circumcision: guidance for doctors (2003). =Journal of Medical Ethics circumcision issue, July 2013= The Journal of Medical Ethics devoted the entire July 2013 issue to the controversial issue of non-therapeutic circumcision of male children. The numerous articles represent a diverse variety of views. =Other views= Povenmire (1988) argues that parents should not have the power to consent to neonatal non-therapeutic circumcision. Richards (1996) argues that parents only have power to consent to therapeutic procedures. Somerville (2000) argues that the nature of the medical benefits cited as a justification for infant circumcision are such that the potential medical problems can be avoided or, if they occur, treated in far less invasive ways than circumcision. She states that the removal of healthy genital tissue from a minor should not be subject to parental discretion, or that physicians who perform the procedure are not acting in accordance with their ethical duties to the patient, regardless of parental consent. Canning (2002) commented that \\"[i]f circumcision becomes less commonly performed in North America [...] the legal system may no longer be able to ignore the conflict between the practice of circumcision and the legal and ethical duties of medical specialists.\\" Benatar and Benatar (2003) argue that \\"it is far from obvious that circumcision reduces sexual pleasure,\\" and that \\"it is far from clear that non-circumcision leaves open a future person‚Äôs options in every regard.\\" They continue: \\"It does preserve the option of future circumcised or uncircumcised status. But it makes other options far more difficult to exercise. Transforming from the uncircumcised to the circumcised state will have psychological and other costs for an adult that are absent for a child. ... Nor are these costs ‚Äúnegligible‚Äù, [...]. At the very least, they are not more negligible than the risks and costs of circumcision.\\" The Committee on Medical Ethics of the British Medical Association (2003) published a paper to guide doctors on the law and ethics of circumcision. It advises medical doctors to proceed on a case by case basis to determine the best interests of the child before deciding to perform a circumcision. The doctor must consider the child's legal and human rights in making his or her determination. It states that a physician has a right to refuse to perform a non-therapeutic circumcision. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia took a similar position. Fox and Thomson (2005) state that in the absence of \\"unequivocal evidence of medical benefit\\", it is \\"ethically inappropriate to subject a child to the acknowledged risks of infant male circumcision.\\" Thus, they believe, \\"the emerging consensus, whereby parental choice holds sway, appears ethically indefensible\\". Morris et al. (2014) argued that \\"...failure to circumcise a baby boy may be unethical because it diminishes his right to good health.\\" The Belgian Federal Consultative Committee for Bioethics (Comit√© Consultatif de Bio√©thique de Belgique) (2017), after a three-year study, has ruled that circumcision of male children for non-therapeutic purposes is unethical in Belgium.Statement in French: The process is irreversible, has no medical justification in most cases, and is performed on minors unable to give their own permission, according to the committee. Paul Schotsmans of the University of Leuven, on behalf of the committee, noted \\"the child‚Äôs right to physical integrity, which is protected by the International Treaty on the Rights of the Child, and in particular its protection from physical injury.\\" The Belgian minister of health replied that the federal institute for health insurance cannot check and know whether in (individual cases) a circumcision is medically justified or not and that she will continue to reimburse circumcision of minors as the safety of the child is her primary concern and she wants to avoid botched circumcisions by non-medical circumcisers. HIV in southern and eastern Africa Rennie et al. (2007) remark that the results of three randomised controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa, showing reduced risk of HIV among circumcised men, \\"alter the terms of the debate over the ethics of male circumcision.\\" However, the methodology of the African RCTs has been severely criticised, thereby invalidating claims that circumcision reduces the sexual transmission of HIV.Boyle, G.J. (2013). Critique of African RCTs into Male Circumcision and HIV Sexual Transmission. In G.C. Denniston et al. (Eds.), Genital Cutting: Protecting Children from Medical, Cultural, and Religious Infringements. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Springer Science+Business Media. doi: 10.1007/978-94-007-6407-1_15 Supporters of circumcision argue that using circumcision and other available means to halt the spread of HIV is in the common good (but overlook the fact that HIV is transmitted in the seminal fluid). Rennie et al. argue that \\"it would be unethical to not seriously consider one of the most promising‚Äîalthough also one of the most controversial‚Äînew approaches to HIV-prevention in the 25-year history of the epidemic.\\" However, there clearly remains a risk of transmitting or acquiring HIV while engaging in unprotected sex and other high risk behaviors (circumcised or not). The World Health Organization (2007) states that provision of circumcision should be consistent with \\"medical ethics and human rights principles.\\" They state that \\"[i]nformed consent, confidentiality and absence of coercion should be assured. ... Parents who are responsible for providing consent, including for the circumcision of male infants, should be given sufficient information regarding the benefits and risks of the procedure in order to determine what is in the best interests of the child.\\"WHO/UNAIDS Technical Consultation. Male Circumcision and HIV Prevention: Research Implications for Policy and Programming. Montreux, 6‚Äì8 March 2007 However, since babies and children are not sexually active, sexually-transmitted HIV infection is not a relevant concern. Critics of non-therapeutic circumcision argue that advocating circumcision to prevent HIV infection may detract from other efforts to prevent the spread of the virus such as using condoms. If the adult chooses to remain celibate or if a couple remain monogamous, or if HIV is eliminated by the time the child is an adult, the sexual reduction surgery would not have been needed. Moreover, they argue that circumcising a child purportedly to partially protect him from HIV infection in adulthood may be seen as granting permission to engage in dangerous sexual practices. Obviously baby boys do not need such protection and can choose for themselves as consenting adults if they want a circumcision. This stance, however, does not take into account the fact that adult men may already have contracted HIV before getting circumcised. The UK National Health Service (NHS) has stated that the African studies have \\"important implications for the control of sexually transmitted infections in Africa\\", but that in the United Kingdom practicing safe sex including condom use is the best way to prevent sexually- transmitted disease when having sex. Surrogate consent Patient autonomy is an important principle of medical ethics. Some believe that consent for a non- therapeutic operation offends the principle of autonomy, when granted by a surrogate. Since children, and especially infants, are legally incompetent to grant informed consent for medical or surgical treatment, that consent must be granted by a surrogate ‚Äî someone designated to act on behalf of the child- patient, if treatment is to occur.J. Steven Svoboda, Robert S. Van Howe, James C. Dwyer, Informed Consent for Neonatal Circumcision: An Ethical and Legal Conundrum. 17 J Contemp Health Law & Policy 61 (2000). A surrogate's powers to grant consent are more circumscribed than the powers granted to a competent individual acting on his own behalf. Reaffirmed May 2011. A surrogate may only act in the best interests of the patient. A surrogate may not put a child at risk for religious reasons. A surrogate may grant consent for a medical procedure that has no medical indication only if it is the child's best interests. The attending physician must provide the surrogate with all material information concerning the proposed benefits, risks, advantages, and drawbacks of the proposed treatment or procedure. The Committee on Bioethics of the AAP (1995) states that parents may only grant surrogate informed permission for diagnosis and treatment with the assent of the child whenever appropriate. There is an unresolved question whether surrogates may grant effective consent for non-therapeutic child circumcision.Peter W. Adler. Is Circumcision Legal? 16(3) Richmond J. L. & Pub. Int. 439 (2013). Richards (1996) argues that parents may only consent to medical care, so are not empowered to grant consent for non-therapeutic circumcision of a child because it is not medical care. The Canadian Paediatric Society (2015) recommends that circumcisions done in the absence of a medical indication or for personal reasons \\"should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices.\\" Regardless of these issues, the general practice of the medical community in the United States is to receive surrogate informed consent or permission from parents or legal guardians for non-therapeutic circumcision of children.

It broadcasts two stations throughout Wales from studios in Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Carmarthen on FM, DAB, digital TV and online. The main network broadcasts for hours a day from 5:30am to midnight with overnight programming simulcast from BBC Radio 5 Live after closedown. A second station, Radio Cymru 2, broadcasts on digital and online platforms, and provides separate breakfast programming for two hours every morning. The managing editor of BBC Radio Cymru is Rhuanedd Richards. Overview BBC Radio Cymru began broadcasting on the morning of Monday 3 January 1977, its first programme being an extended news bulletin presented at 6:45am by Gwyn Llewellyn and Geraint Jones. This was followed at 7am by the first edition of the breakfast magazine show ', presented by Hywel Gwynfryn with contributions from a network of local reporters in studios across Wales. The first record played on Radio Cymru was Ffrindiau Bore Oes by Hergest. The station was the first broadcasting outlet dedicated wholly to programmes in Welsh, allowing much more airtime for such output than had previously been available on the old Radio 4 Wales (or its predecessors the Welsh Home Service and, before that, the BBC Welsh Regional Programme). Initially, the service was part-time and restricted to breakfast shows, extended news bulletins at breakfast, lunchtime & early evening and a number of off-peak opt-outs from a sustaining Radio 4 Wales feed. In November 1979, Radio Cymru's programming was expanded to 65 hours a week, introducing mid-morning output on weekdays, along with a growing line-up of dramas, light entertainment and documentaries. The network continued to expand over the next two decades before achieving a continuous service of up to 20 hours a day. Later developments in the 21st century saw Radio Cymru introducing a nightly youth strand, C2, and regional opt-outs for South West Wales, which were axed in 2008 but later reintroduced to provide live commentary of Swansea City A.F.C. matches. The station has also been streaming online since January 2005. Radio Cymru is similar in format to many \\"general\\" radio stations, with news programmes at breakfast (', 'First Post'), lunchtime (' ‚Äì a debate-centred programme), and drive-time (', 'Afternoon Post'); together with presenter-driven sequences mixing music with chat to invited studio guests, calls from listeners, competitions etc. Radio Cymru also produces drama, features, current affairs, youth, and sports programming. Over the years, it has done much to promote the language, with its sports commentators coining new terms which later became accepted by Welsh linguists. One of its more unusualand longest-runningprogrammes is ', a poetry competition in which teams must come up with poetry in specific styles on specific topics. Listening figures According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 124,000 listeners and a listening share of 2.1% as of December 2018. The average number of hours per listener is 9.1 hours a week. Notable presenters *Sh√¢n Cothi (Bore Cothi on weekday mornings) *Lisa Gwilym (Wednesday evenings, Radio Cymru 2 - Sunday breakfast) *Hywel Gwynfryn (Sunday afternoons) *Caryl Parry Jones (Radio Cymru 2 - Monday-Thursday breakfast) *Dai Jones (Ar Eich Cais) *Nia Roberts (Stiwdio) *Huw Stephens (Thursday evenings, Radio Cymru 2 - Friday breakfast) Radio Cymru 2 On 19 September 2016, BBC Cymru launched a pop-up radio station, (Radio Cymru More), broadcasting for three months in the run-up to the station's 40th anniversary. Consisting of five hours of music-led entertainment programming each weekday, Radio Cymru Mwy was available on DAB in south east Wales and online. Six months after the station closed, BBC Cymru announced it would launch a permanent second station, Radio Cymru 2. The new service airs for two hours every morning on digital and online platforms, as a music and entertainment alternative to the main network, which airs the breakfast news programme, Post Cyntaf. BBC Radio Cymru 2 began broadcasting at 6.30am on 29 January 2018. It airs as an opt-out service from 6.30am-8.30am on weekdays, 7-9am on Saturdays and 8-10am on Sundays. The daily breakfast show broadcasts from Cardiff (Monday‚ÄìSaturday) and Bangor (Sundays) with short news bulletins on weekdays from Aberystwyth. Transmission BBC Radio Cymru is broadcast across Wales FM and DAB. It is also available on Freeview in Wales, throughout the UK on Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media and internationally online. As Radio Cymru was created from an opt-out of BBC Radio 4, it inherited the FM transmitters previously used by Radio 4 across Wales. At the time of the station's launch, it was the only radio service in the UK broadcasting solely on FM. BBC Radio Cymru 2 is broadcast across Wales on DAB.

DRDC has approximately 1,400 employees across eight research centres within Canada.  History  After the First World War, national research and development in Canada was organized under the National Research Council (NRC). The NRC was founded in 1925 based on a wartime British recommendation to establish military laboratories in Canada, but by that time the main priorities were developing domestic university and industrial research and civilian projects.Turner, p.15 Greater interest in military applied research arrived in 1935Turner, p.16 when Major-General Andrew McNaughton became President of the NRC.;Turner, p.17 in the period before the Second World War the NRC undertook research in radar, aviation medicine, artillery, aircraft, gas masks, and metallic magnesium production.Turner, p.18 Chalmers Jack Mackenzie became acting President at the onset of the Second World War when McNaughton assumed an operational command within the Canadian Army, formally succeeding McNaughton in 1944.Turner, p.30 Following the fall of France in June 1940, the NRC assumed control of all Canadian scientific research and responsible for applying it toward military applications.Turner, p.20 Laboratories and facilities were established by the NRC and the Canadian Armed Forces.;Turner, p.26 biological and chemical warfare laboratories cooperated closely with Allied counterparts.Turner, p.29 In 1944, Chalmers Mackenzie and the armed forces began considering the issue of post-war military research, and concluded that a separate military research organization was required.Turner, p.35 The result was the creation of the Defence Research Board (DRB) within the Department of National Defence (DND) in April 1947, which took over coordinating defence research from the NRCTurner, p.37 and advising DND on scientific matter.Turner, p.69 The overall organization of defence research continued to mimic the NRC.Turner, p.37 The DRB was - as envisioned by proposals in 1945 - an interim solution; creating an organization within DND required minimal political action compared to creating a new government department that would subsume both the NRC and defence research.Turner, p.36 Omond Solandt was the first Chairman of the DRB.Turner, p.41 The DRB received seven existing NRC facilities.Turner, p.41 The DRB was the last part of DND to adapt to the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces of 1968. DRB began transitioning to the new structure in 1974, and dissolved in 1977. Six of the seven DRB research establishments were transferred to the newly created Defence Research and Development Branch (DRDB) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CF).Turner, p.298 In the 1990s, budget cuts and the complexity of greater reliance on cheaper contracting drove a review of the organization of defence research. In 2000, the DRDB was replaced by Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) which was - like the DRB before - a DND agency.Turner, p.2317  Research Centres  = DRDC, Atlantic Research Centre = Located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the Research Centre conducts research and development activities related to the maritime defence and security domains, but also to the air and land environments. The Atlantic Research Centre traces its formation to 1944 when it was established as the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic (DREA) by the Royal Canadian Navy. DREA was one of the originating organizations that came together in 1947 to form the Defense Research Board which later became DRDC. The Centre provides expertise in the following areas: * antisubmarine warfare * mine and torpedo defence * shipboard command and control * naval platform technology * emerging materials * signature management * maritime information and knowledge management * virtual platforms and virtual combat systems The Atlantic centre also operates two materials laboratories in the CFB Halifax and Esquimalt Dockyards, which provide scientific consulting and troubleshooting services to the Canadian Armed Forces (primarily the Royal Canadian Navy) on chemical, metallurgical and engineering problems that affect the operational capability of military vehicles and equipment. = DRDC, Valcartier Research Centre = Founded in 1945 as the Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment (CARDE), it became Defence Research Establishment Valcartier (DREV) in the early 1970s, and finally DRDC Valcartier (RDDC Valcartier in French) on 1 April 2000.

The Suffield Research Centre is a Canadian centre of excellence for chemical and biological defence and has research programs in blast, casualty management, and autonomous systems. The centre‚Äô work feeds into the combined national effort to keep Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) safe from the devastating consequences chemical (C), biological (B), radiological (R), nuclear (N), and explosive (E) threats could have on human health, the environment, and major infrastructure. DRDC operations in Suffield include two unique national assets: Experimental Proving Ground (EPG) and the Counter Terrorism and Technology Centre (CTTC). The EPG is Canada‚Äôs only proving ground of its kind for military research and development. Its immense land space (470 km2), air space, and 105 realty assets (specialized laboratories, trial sites and facilities) make it a research and development resource to advance DRDC/DND‚Äôs program. It is also accessible to defence industry partners upon request. CTTC offers realistic training (over 2,200 CAF and First Responders per year) helping them respond safely and effectively to incidents involving CBRNE threats. The centre provides expertise in the following areas: * C/B detection & forensics; * C/B protection technologies and systems; * Blast threat mitigation and assessment; * Advanced energetics; * Medical countermeasures; * Modelling and analysis of threats; * Equipment evaluation and testing; * Casualty management/blast injury research; * Autonomous systems operations (ground and air); and, * CBRNE Defence Training = DRDC, Centre for Operational Research and Analysis (CORA) = The Centre for Operational Research and Analysis provides scientific rigour to decision support and option analysis to the Department of National Defence, the Canadian Armed Forces, and Canadian security partners. The centre delivers options, recommendations, and potential outcomes to key decision makers by providing timely quantitative and qualitative analysis reports and objective expert advice. = DRDC, Director General Military Personnel Research and Analysis (DGMPRA) = DGMPRA responds to the research needs of both the Assistant Deputy Minister (Science and Technology) and the Chief of Military Personnel within the Department of National Defence. The Centre conducts strategic and operational research in the areas of: * personnel generation * personnel and family support * operational and organizational dynamics The Centre also has research capabilities in the following areas: * modeling and analysis * forecasting * surveys, focus groups, and interviews * strategic analysis * concept development * secondary data analysis * data mining * benchmarking * geographic information systems * selection test development * job analysis = DRDC, Centre for Security Science = Defence Research and Development Canada‚Äôs Centre for Security Science operates in partnership with Public Safety Canada. It conducts research and development activities in the field of public safety and security science and technology as well as related testing and assessment activities. The Centre identifies trends in security technology and related threats, and maintains a network of national and international science and technology experts and partners involved in public safety and security. The Centre also leads the Canadian Safety and Security Program and the Emergency Responder Testing and Evaluation Establishment. = Defence Research Establishment Pacific (DREP) = This Research Centre was Closed in 1994. It was located in Naden, Esquimalt, a suburb of Victoria, BC, and was originally called the Pacific Naval Laboratory (PNL). DREP was engaged in a variety of research areas.

The name comes from the Latin word \\"nummus,\\" which means \\"coin.\\" Signs and symptoms Nummular dermatitis is characterized by chronic or relapsing itchy coin-sized ovoid- shaped red plaques. They can occur on the trunk, limbs, face, and hands.  Causes  Many contact sensitizers or irritants are known to cause contact dermatitis superimposed on nummular dermatitis. Studies have implicated nickel, cobalt, chromate, and fragrance as likely culprits. Xerosis, or dehydration of skin is also a likely cause. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria or Candida albicans may also play a role.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of nummular dermatitis is largely via clinical observation. Biopsies are typically not necessary, and cannot be used to rule out other atopic dermatitis or other eczemas. However, patch testing may be employed to rule out irritants (contact dermatitis) as a cause. In children, nummular dermatitis is commonly confused with tinea corporis. Treatment One of the keys to treatment and prevention involves keeping the skin moisturized. Lotions, creams, and bath oils may help prevent an outbreak. If the condition flares up, a common treatment involves the application of topical corticosteroids. Oral antihistamines may help lessen itching. Avoidance of irritants is a common strategy. More severe cases sometimes respond to ultraviolet light treatment. If the condition occurs only during the sun-less winter months then vitamin D supplement might be an effective treatment.  Epidemiology  The prevalence of nummular dermatitis in the United States is approximately 2 per 1,000. It is considered a disease of adulthood, for it is rare in children.

Lipscomb Abner Smith Lipscomb (February 10, 1789, in Abbeville District, South Carolina ‚Äì December 8, 1856, in Austin, Texas) was an American and Texan lawyer and judge. He was also appointed Secretary of State for the Republic of Texas under the administration of President Mirabeau B. Lamar. Lipscomb studied law in the office of John C. Calhoun and passed the bar in 1810. In 1811, he began practice in St. Stephens, Alabama (then part of the Mississippi Territory.) He served in the Alabama territorial legislature in 1818 and became a circuit judge in 1819 when Alabama was admitted to statehood. When Chief Justice Clement Clay of the Alabama Supreme Court resigned in 1823, Lipscomb was chosen to be the next Chief Justice. The court was reorganized in 1832; Lipscomb continued as Chief Justice of the court, where he served until 1835. Lipscomb served a term in the Alabama state legislature in 1838. He married on April 13, 1813, at St. Stephens to Elizabeth Gaines, sister of Ann Lawrence Gaines who married their cousin, Col. George Strother Gaines. Col. Gaines' nephew, Hon. Francis Strother Lyon began the study of law while working for Abner Smith Lipscomb in his office in St. Stephens. In 1839 Lipscomb moved to the Republic of Texas and established a law practice in Brenham. He was Secretary of State under President Lamar from January 31, 1840, to December 13, 1840. Lipscomb was a member of the Convention of 1845; in 1845, he also served on a committee that wrote a report on the Texas General Land Office. He was appointed an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court in 1846 by Governor James Pinckney Henderson. As he was elected in 1851 and re-elected in 1856, he continued in this post until November 1856. He taught Law courses at Baylor University from 1849 to 1856. Lipscomb died in Austin, Texas and was buried in the State Cemetery. Lipscomb County, Texas and its county seat of Lipscomb, Texas, are named in honor of him.

It tells the story of workers in Buenos Aires, Argentina who reclaim control of a closed Forja auto plant where they once worked and turn it into a worker cooperative. Summary The plant closed as a result of the economic policies of the Carlos Menem government under the watchful eye of the International Monetary Fund. While in bankruptcy protection, the company appeared to be selling off property and inventory to pay creditors ‚Äì a move which further reduced the chances of the facility returning to production. In an effort to establish their own control, the workers occupied the factory and began a long battle to win the right to operate it themselves, as a cooperative. This collective movement has gained strength in Argentina, having started with a garment factory several years earlier. The factory workers waded through the courts and legislative system with help from the experience of these other groups who had fought the same battle, and ultimately secured their right to operate the plant. The film describes the ideological fights beyond co-operative ownership, showing how Menem regained strength as he ran for a subsequent term, despite the poor performance of his privatisation while in office. Ultimately, workers succeed.

It began broadcasting on 13 November 1978, following the demise of the 'Radio 4 Wales' service (previously the Welsh Home Service) and BBC Radio 4's transformation into a national network, moving from medium wave to long wave. Radio Wales broadcasts in English, whilst sister station Radio Cymru has Welsh language programming. The station's managing editor is Colin Paterson. According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 316,000 listeners and a listening share of 4% as of December 2018. History In November 1978, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Scotland were created as distinct stations on the former Radio 4 Scottish and Welsh medium wave opt-out frequencies of 810 and 882 kHz. They were initially part-time services, broadcasting for only 20 hours per week, and relaying Radios 2 and 4 at other times. However, the groundwork had been laid for both networks to gradually become full-time services. Radio Wales now broadcasts for up to 20 hours a day with a simulcast of the BBC World Service after closedown each night. BBC Radio Wales was preceded in the autumn of 1978 by four experimental local radio stations broadcasting for a single week: Radio Wrexham, Radio Deeside, Radio Merthyr and Radio Rhondda. They were broadcast using an RT√â Outside Broadcast transmitter. The first editor of BBC Radio Wales was Teleri Bevan, a former producer for Radio 4 Wales. Radio Wales commenced broadcasting at 6.30am on Monday 13 November 1978 with the first edition of AM, a breakfast magazine show presented by Anita Morgan, which replaced the news-driven predecessor Good Morning Wales. Chris Stuart later took over AM, presenting the programme for almost a decade, before it was replaced by a revival of Good Morning Wales, which was again axed in May 2019. The other main presenters for the first decade on air included Mike Flynn, who hosted a show each weekday until 1989, Vincent Kane, Noreen Bray and Alun Williams. By 1985, Roy Noble was also a regular daily voice, presenting weekday magazine shows for the station for 27 years. Old Radio 4 type continuity studios were modified to become 'self operated' by the early 1980s. Outside broadcasts from different towns in Wales were also introduced, with Mike Flynn and Alun Williams hosting a weekly three-hour live show on Friday mornings. BBC Radio Wales also began to use publicity similar to the type used by commercial radio stations in the UK. Other early presenters included Wyn Calvin, Maureen Staffer, Sylvia Horn, G. V. Wynne Jones (Geevers), Claire Vincent, Piet Brinton, Jackie Emlyn and Princess Anne's biographer Brian Hoey. = Radio Gwent and Radio Clwyd opt-outs = Following BBC Wales' experiments with community radio in 1978, two permanent opt-out services were developed in the North East and the South East. Radio Deeside was reopened in February 1980 in response to the closure of the Shotton steelworks. Its coverage area was expanded to the rest of Clwyd in October 1981 and the station was subsequently renamed BBC Radio Clwyd, broadcasting extended local news bulletins, a mid- morning show and occasional special programming from studios in Mold until its closure in October 1993. After the closure of Radio Clwyd, local bulletins for north-east Wales continued until 2002 - staff having moved from Mold to Wrexham in summer 1998. BBC Radio Gwent, based in Cwmbran, broadcast from 18 April 1983 until March 1991. Radio Gwent was available on FM, and since its closure has continued to relay the national Radio Wales service on the same FM frequencies to the Gwent area. Both of these stations operated at peak times only, and carried Radio Wales at other times. Programmes BBC Radio Wales broadcasts each weekday from 5.30am - 1am and from 5am - 1am at weekends. The station simulcasts overnight programming from the BBC World Service after closedown every night. Weekday programming includes the flagship breakfast news magazine Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers (Monday‚ÄìThursday), magazine shows with Jason Mohammad (Monday‚ÄìWednesday), Wynne Evans and Eleri Si√¥n, the evening show with Janice Long, and Chris Needs' long-running Friendly Garden from 10pm-1am until late July 2020, when he died at the age of 66. Weekend programming includes Sunday afternoon shows with Lynn Bowles and Roy Noble, Adam Walton's new music show on Saturday nights, Celtic Heartbeat with Frank Hennessy and entertainment shows with comedians Chris Corcoran and Owen Money. =Sports coverage= A BBC Wales Sport radio booth Radio Wales Sport is broadcast on Saturdays, generally between 2pm and 7pm, during the football and rugby season (the programme is extended on occasions to include live commentary of early and late matches). Radio Wales Sport features localised FM commentary of Swansea City in the south west of Wales, Cardiff City in the south-east of Wales, and Wrexham in north Wales with a rolling service of match updates and results on medium wave. The station's commentators are led by BBC Wales football correspondent Rob Phillips and BBC Wales rugby correspondent Gareth Charles. The summarisers include former Wales football captain Kevin Ratcliffe and former Wales flanker Martyn Williams.

It is also availabale on Freeview in Wales and throughout the UK on Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media. As Radio Wales was created from an opt- out of BBC Radio 4, it inherited the medium wave transmitters previously used by Radio 4 across Wales‚Äîthe main service coming from the Washford transmitter in Somerset on . This transmitter was originally built to cover southern Wales and most of the West Country, and has a far greater coverage than its intended transmission area. It can be heard across the Bristol area, in much of Devon and northern Cornwall, as well as eastern and south eastern counties of Ireland. Initially, Radio Wales was not broadcast on FM as Radio 4's former FM transmitters in Wales were used for BBC Radio Cymru. In 1983, Radio Wales gained some FM coverage with the creation of opt-out service, BBC Radio Gwent. After the breakfast programme, Radio Gwent simulcast most of Radio Wales' output. When the station closed in 1991, the FM frequencies were retained to broadcast Radio Wales. From 1999 onwards, the BBC was able to start creating an FM network for Radio Wales, including a 120 kW ERP transmitter near Aberystwyth. On 6 December 2011, Radio Wales added the 250 kW ERP Wenvoe transmitter to its network on FM, replacing a low-power FM transmitter on the Wenallt Hill. On 24 October 2018, the station increased its FM coverage in North East and Mid Wales by taking over 32 transmitters previously used by BBC Radio 3. The changeover allowed an estimated 400,000 listeners to receive Radio Wales on FM, extending its reach to a potential 91% of households in Wales. Regional opt-outs have been established for sports coverage on FM; specifically live football commentaries involving Cardiff City in the South East, Swansea City in the South West and Wrexham in the North.  Race discrimination case  In 2001, presenter Lionel Kelleway won a case for racial discrimination against BBC Radio Wales, when they dropped his Landmark series, which won Sony Awards in 1991 and 1992, after around ten years, because of his English accent.

The organizations pursue social justice, civil rights, and political activism. In December 1971, Jackson resigned from Operation Breadbasket after clashing with Ralph Abernathy and founded Operation PUSH. In 1984, Jackson founded the National Rainbow Coalition. It merged with PUSH in 1996. The combined organization's national headquarters is on the South Side of Chicago and it has regional branches in Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Atlanta, Silicon Valley, New Orleans, and Boston. Operation PUSH raised public awareness to initiate corporate action and government sponsorship. The National Rainbow Coalition became a prominent political organization that raised public awareness of numerous political issues and consolidated a large voting bloc. The merged entity has undertaken numerous social initiatives.  PUSH  Kenwood community area of Chicago. Operation PUSH, an acronym for People United to Save (later Serve) Humanity, was an organization that advocated black self-help and achieved a broad audience for its liberal stances on social justice and civil rights. Operation PUSH's origins can be traced to a factional split in Operation Breadbasket, an affiliate of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In 1966, Martin Luther King Jr., the head of the SCLC, appointed Jackson to head the Chicago chapter of Operation Breadbasket, which became a coalition of black ministers and entrepreneurs. After 1968, Jackson increasingly clashed with King's successor at SCLC, Ralph Abernathy. The break became complete in December 1971 when Abernathy suspended Jackson for \\"administrative improprieties and repeated acts of violation of organizational policy.\\" Jackson resigned from Operation Breadbasket, called together his allies, and formed Operation PUSH. From its inception, Jackson called its membership a \\"Rainbow Coalition.\\" This concept and phrase was originally created by the 1968 Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton. Hampton used it to describe the multiethnic revolutionary federation he founded. Jackson was not part of Hampton's Rainbow Coalition, and had a difficult relationship with the Panthers. Some former members of Hampton's coalition resent Jackson for using the name, partly because Jackson's politics are reformist, and partly because Jackson copyrighted the name, preventing others from using it. Although money was a problem at first, initial backing came from Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, Gary, Indiana Mayor Richard Hatcher, Aretha Franklin, Jim Brown, and Ossie Davis. Jesse Jackson speaks at 1973 PUSH National Convention The organizational meeting of PUSH was in the Chicago home of T.R.M. Howard, a prominent black doctor and community leader on the South Side. Before he moved to Chicago in 1956, Howard developed a national reputation as a Mississippi civil rights leader, surgeon, and entrepreneur. He served on PUSH's board of directors and chaired the finance committee.David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 209‚Äì10. Through PUSH Jackson was able to continue pursuing the same economic objectives that Operation Breadbasket had. In addition, his organization expanded into social and political development for blacks in Chicago and nationwide. The 1970s saw various tactics to pursue the organization's objectives including direct action campaigns, weekly radio broadcasts, and awards, through which Jackson protected black homeowners, workers, and businesses, and honored prominent blacks in the US and abroad. Jackson also started a campaign against legalizing abortion after Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. PUSH was concerned with minority youth reading, and championed education through PUSH-Excel, a spin-off program that emphasized keeping inner-city youths in school while assisting them with job placement. The program, which persuaded inner-city youth to pledge in writing to study two hours per night and involved parental monitoring, impressed Jimmy Carter, whose administration became a large sponsor after Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano and Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall courted Jackson. Lake Shore Drive Senior Citizens March (July 1973). The organization was very successful at committing major corporations with large presences in the black community to adopt affirmative action programs in which they hired more black executives and supervisors and to buy from black suppliers, wholesalers, and distributors. The organization employed prayer vigils to call attention to issues. It opposed Ronald Reagan's workfare initiative requiring that welfare recipients work for part of their benefits. The organization staged several boycotts, including early 1980s boycotts of Anheuser Busch and Coca-Cola as well as a 1986 boycott of CBS television affiliates. The boycotts became so well known that at one point David Duke supporters referred to a boycott of Nike, Inc. as oppression of whites by blacks. Nike spokesperson Michael Jordan disavowed the boycott. The boycotts of Budweiser and Coke as well as one against Kentucky Fried Chicken were touted for having won minority job concessions from white businesses.  National Rainbow Coalition  Jesse Jackson was a Presidential candidate in both 1984 and 1988. The National Rainbow Coalition (Rainbow Coalition for short) was a political organization that grew out of Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign. During the campaign, Jackson began speaking about a \\"Rainbow Coalition\\", an idea created by Fred Hampton, regarding the disadvantaged and welcomed voters from a broad spectrum of races and creeds. The goals of the campaign were to demand social programs, voting rights, and affirmative action for all groups that had been neglected by Reaganomics. Jackson's campaign blamed President Ronald Reagan's policies for reduction of government domestic spending, causing new unemployment and encouraging economic investment outside of the inner cities, while they discouraged the rebuilding of urban industry. The industrial layoffs caused by these policies hit the Black and other minority populations particularly hard. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention on July 18, 1984, in San Francisco, California, Jackson delivered an address entitled \\"The Rainbow Coalition\\". The speech called for Arab Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, youth, disabled veterans, small farmers, lesbians and gays to join with African Americans and Jewish Americans for political purpose. Whereas the purpose of PUSH had been to fight for economic and educational opportunities, the Rainbow Coalition was created to address political empowerment and public policy issues. After his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 1984, Jackson attempted to build a broad base of support among groups that \\"were hurt by Reagan administration policies\\" - racial minorities, the poor, small farmers, working mothers, the unemployed, some labor union members, gays, and lesbians.  1990s onwards  Jackson moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. to serve as shadow senator from 1991 to 1996. When he returned to Chicago in 1996 he merged his organizations. The merged entity advocates for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, other minorities, and women. Its main economic goal is to have more minorities on the payrolls, in the boardrooms, and on the supplier lists of major corporations. The industries it most aggressively pursues are the financial sector on Wall Street, the telecommunications field and high-tech firms in Silicon Valley. The Wall Street activities are organized under sub-organization \\"The Wall Street Project\\". The organization has been active in pursuit of increase minority representation in other industries, most notably the broadcast media, the entertainment industry, and the automobile industry. It has also sought increased representation by minority administrators in college and professional sports under the leadership of Jesse Jackson, Jr. For Hispanic issues the merged entity works closely with the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Council of La Raza. In 1998 the organization attacked Freddie Mac for its lending and employment practices, which led to its pledge to earmark $1 billion in mortgage loans specifically for minorities, to donate more than $1 million directly to Rainbow/PUSH and to become a sponsor of Jackson's annual Wall Street Project. In 2000, the organization investigated the case of Raynard Johnson, who was found hanged by a belt from a tree in front of his home in Kokomo, Mississippi. Jackson labelled it a \\"lynching\\", although two autopsies both concluded that the death was a suicide.Burden of Proof: Hanging Death Mystery in Mississippi: Suicide or Murder? , CNN transcript, July 21, 2000 In the early 2000s (decade), Rainbow/PUSH worked with NASCAR to increase the number of minorities involved in auto racing, through direct financial support and projects to find talented African-American racing drivers.NASCAR is trying to change its image, Rupen Fofaria, ESPN.com, February 12, 2002 This initiative was ended in 2003, after the racing sanctioning body was criticized by conservative groups for the partnership.NASCAR ends donations to Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH, Chris Jenkins, USA Today, July 28, 2003 Among the smaller campaigns it has undertaken are the HIV/AIDS Initiative for funding for AIDS programs; the National Field Department support of \\"constructive agitation to bring about societal change\\"; and the Prison Outpost project, whose ultimate goal is \\"to eliminate the need for prisons.\\" Through his organization and its predecessors Jackson has advocated universal health care, a war on drugs, direct peace negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, ending apartheid in South Africa and advancing democracy in Haiti. The following is the organization's list of major issues: * 1% Student Loans * Jobs and Economic Empowerment * Employee Rights and Livable Wages * Educational Access * Fair and Decent Housing * Voter Registration and Civic Education * Election Law Reform * Fairness in the Media, Sports, and Criminal Justice System * Political Empowerment * Trade and Foreign Policy * Affirmative Action and Equal Rights * Gender Equality * Environmental Justice Former congressman Mel Reynolds, who served a sentence in prison for sexual assault and bank fraud, was hired by Rainbow/PUSH as its resident scholar on prison reform after his release in 2001. The organization is a member of several anti-war coalitions including Win Without War, United for Peace and Justice, and After Downing Street. In the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, Rev. Jesse Jackson promised to raise money and collect donations for those affected. The organization set up drop-off locations in Chicago to assist with relief efforts.  Involvement in the Duke Lacrosse team controversy  In 2006, Jesse Jackson promised the Rainbow/Push Coalition would pay Crystal Mangum's college tuition. Mangum made false rape allegations against members of Duke University's men's lacrosse team who had hired her as a stripper. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. Jackson said that whatever the outcome of the trial, the tuition offer would still be good.  Notes   References  * David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito. T.R.M.

Net reactivity in a reactor is the sum total of all these contributions, of which the void coefficient is but one. Reactors in which either the moderator or the coolant is a liquid typically will have a void coefficient value that is either negative (if the reactor is under-moderated) or positive (if the reactor is over-moderated). Reactors in which neither the moderator nor the coolant is a liquid (e.g., a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled reactor) will have a void coefficient value equal to zero. It is unclear how the definition of 'void' coefficient applies to reactors in which the moderator/coolant is neither liquid nor gas (supercritical water reactor).  Explanation  Nuclear fission reactors run on nuclear chain reactions, in which each nucleus that undergoes fission releases heat and neutrons. Each neutron may impact another nucleus and cause it to undergo fission. The speed of this neutron affects its probability of causing additional fission, as does the presence of neutron-absorbing material. On the one hand, slow neutrons are more easily absorbed by fissile nuclei than fast neutrons, so a neutron moderator that slows neutrons will increase the reactivity of a nuclear reactor. On the other hand, a neutron absorber will decrease the reactivity of a nuclear reactor. These two mechanisms are used to control the thermal power output of a nuclear reactor. In order to keep a nuclear reactor intact and functioning, and to extract useful power from it, a cooling system must be used. Some reactors circulate pressurized water; some use liquid metal, such as sodium, NaK, lead, or mercury; others use gases (see advanced gas-cooled reactor). If the coolant is a liquid, it may boil if the temperature inside the reactor rises. This boiling leads to voids inside the reactor. Voids may also form if coolant is lost from the reactor in some sort of accident (called a loss of coolant accident, which has other dangers). Some reactors operate with the coolant in a constant state of boiling, using the generated vapor to turn turbines. The coolant liquid may act as a neutron absorber, as a neutron moderator, usually as both but with one or other role as the most influent. In either case, the amount of void inside the reactor can affect the reactivity of the reactor. The change in reactivity caused by a change of voids inside the reactor is directly proportional to the void coefficient. A positive void coefficient means that the reactivity increases as the void content inside the reactor increases due to increased boiling or loss of coolant; for example, if the coolant act predominantly as neutron absorber. This positive void coefficient causes a positive feedback loop, starting with the first occurrence of steam bubbles. This can quickly boil all the coolant in the reactor, if not countered by an (automatic) control mechanism, or if said mechanism's response time is too slow. This happened in the RBMK reactor that was destroyed in the Chernobyl disaster as the automatic control mechanism was mostly disabled (and the operators were trying somewhat recklessly to rapidly restore a high power level. Due to poor control rod design, the operators were unaware that there was a maximal level of neutron poison in the core). A negative void coefficient means that the reactivity decreases as the void content inside the reactor increases - but it also means that the reactivity increases if the void content inside the reactor is reduced. In boiling-water reactors with large negative void coefficients, a sudden pressure rise (caused, for example, by unplanned closure of a streamline valve) will result in a sudden decrease in void content: the increased pressure will cause some of the steam bubbles to condense (\\"collapse\\"); and the thermal output will possibly increase until it is terminated by safety systems, by increased void formation due to the higher power, or, possibly, by system or component failures that relieve pressure, causing void content to increase and power to decrease. Boiling water reactors are all designed (and required) to handle this type of transient. On the other hand, if a reactor is designed to operate with no voids at all, a large negative void coefficient may serve as a safety system. A loss of coolant in such a reactor decreases the thermal output, but of course heat that is generated is no longer removed, so the temperature could rise (if all other safety systems simultaneously failed). Thus, a large void coefficient, whether positive or negative, can be either a design issue (requiring more careful, faster-acting control systems) or a desired quality depending on reactor design. Gas-cooled reactors do not have issues with voids forming.  Reactor designs  * Boiling water reactors generally have negative void coefficients, and in normal operation the negative void coefficient allows reactor power to be adjusted by changing the rate of water flow through the core. The negative void coefficient can cause an unplanned reactor power increase in events (such as sudden closure of a streamline valve) where the reactor pressure is suddenly increased. In addition, the negative void coefficient can result in power oscillations in the event of a sudden reduction in core flow, such as might be caused by a recirculation pump failure. Boiling water reactors are designed to ensure that the rate of pressure rise from a sudden streamline valve closure is limited to acceptable values, and they include multiple safety systems designed to ensure that any sudden reactor power increases or unstable power oscillations are terminated before fuel or piping damage can occur. * Pressurized water reactors operate with a relatively small amount of voids, and the water serves as both moderator and coolant. Thus a large negative void coefficient ensures that if the water boils or is lost the power output will drop. * CANDU reactors have positive void coefficients that are small enough that the control systems can easily respond to boiling coolant before the reactor reaches dangerous temperatures (see References). * RBMK reactors, such as the reactors at Chernobyl, have a dangerously high positive void coefficient. This allowed the reactor to run on unenriched uranium and to require no heavy water, saving costs (also, unlike other Russian main reactor design VVER, RBMKs were dual use, able to produce weapons-grade plutonium). Before the Chernobyl accident these reactors had a positive void coefficient of 4.7 beta and after the accident that was lowered to 0.7 beta. This was done so all RBMK reactors could resume safe operation and produce much needed power for the then USSR and its satellites. * Fast breeder reactors do not use moderators, since they run on fast neutrons, but the coolant (often lead or sodium) may serve as a neutron absorber and reflector. For this reason they have a positive void coefficient. * Magnox reactors, advanced gas-cooled reactors and pebble bed reactors are gas-cooled and so void coefficients are not an issue. In fact, some can be designed so that total loss of coolant does not cause core meltdown even in the absence of active control systems. As with any reactor design, loss of coolant is only one of many possible failures that could potentially lead to an accident. In case of accidental ingress of liquid water into the core of pebble bed reactors, a positive void coefficient may occur.See chapter 5.1.4 Magnox and UNGG reactors were designed with the dual purpose of producing electrical power and weapon grade plutonium for the Nuclear weapons.

The building is tall, with 38 stories, and was the largest office building in the world by floor area upon its completion, with of floor space. It replaced the Equitable Life Building, the previous headquarters of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, which burned down in 1912. The skyscraper was designed by Ernest R. Graham in the neoclassical style, with Peirce Anderson as the architect-in-charge. The building's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. Upon its completion, the Equitable Building was controversial because of its lack of setbacks, which in turn does not allow sunlight to reach the surrounding ground. This contributed to the adoption of the first modern building and zoning restrictions on vertical structures in Manhattan, the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The Equitable Building was developed by a group led by T. Coleman du Pont; work on the Equitable Building started in 1913 and was completed in 1915. Upon opening, it hosted a variety of tenants, and by the 1920s, was the most valuable building in New York City. Though the edifice was named after the Equitable Life Insurance Company, the company occupied a small portion of the building until it moved out during 1960. The owner , Silverstein Properties, purchased the Equitable Building in 1980 and renovated it multiple times. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978 and a New York City landmark in 1996. Site The building occupies the entire block bounded by Broadway to the west, Cedar Street to the north, Nassau Street to the east, and Pine Street to the south. The dimensions of the block are irregular, with none of the sides being parallel. The building has a facade measuring approximately on Broadway, on Cedar Street, on Nassau Street, and and on Pine Street. The plot is shaped like a trapezoid, with the Nassau Street and Broadway facades being parallel. The plot covers about . There are numerous buildings and structures immediately adjacent to the Equitable Building. Zuccotti Park is located to the northwest, while 140 Broadway is to the north and 28 Liberty Street is to the northeast. Federal Hall National Memorial is to the southeast and 14 Wall Street and the American Surety Building are to the south. Across Broadway to the west and southwest are the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings. Design The Equitable Building, an early skyscraper, was designed by Ernest R. Graham of D. H. Burnham & Company (later Graham, Anderson, Probst & White), with Peirce Anderson as the architect-in-charge. In contrast to the contemporary Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, Singer Building, and Woolworth Building, the Equitable Building was designed as a bulky mass, rather than a \\"slender, romantic tower\\". This was affected by the fact that the other three buildings were corporate symbols from renowned architects, while the Equitable Building was a speculative development whose designer had little experience in New York City. The ultimate design was distinct from corporate structures such as the Met Life Tower or restrained office buildings such as the Flatiron Building, and raised substantial controversy upon its completion. The articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The exterior is inspired from Greek and Roman architecture. In total, it is tall when the penthouse's center tower is included; a separate measurement of is given when measured to the top of the other penthouses, and the height excluding any of the penthouses is . = Form = Although the Equitable Building is 40 stories tall with , this includes two stories in the building's penthouses as well as two \\"interior stories\\" that are not visible from the facade. The interior stories are located at the 3rd and 34th floors, and there are three basement levels. The exterior of the building thus consists of 36 stories with a total height of . Originally, the structure was proposed as a 42-story skyscraper, but this was reduced to 36 effective stories to maximize elevator safety and speed, given the assumption that 50,000 people visited the building each day and that there were 48 elevators that could each serve 1,200 people an hour. The Equitable Building has no setback from the street beyond the depth of the sidewalk.Smith, Caleb. \\"Equitable Building\\" in This is because Graham wanted the building to have the latest technological systems, such as elevators, heating, ventilation, and fireproofing, while also maximizing usable office space. Two light courts, one each to the east and west, divide the facades in half above the seventh floor. As a result, the Equitable Building appears in the shape of the letter when viewed from above. The design of the Equitable Building is similar to that of the now-demolished Hudson Terminal office buildings and the 49 Chambers building. The two-story penthouse is tall; the penthouse roof is tall, but the center tower rises another . = Facade = Building entrance The building's facade is made of brick, granite, and terracotta, and white Yule Marble and iron are also used in the building. The granite, brick, and marble were estimated to be . Anderson designed the facade with a base, shaft, and capital, similar to the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building by Cass Gilbert, but with facades on all sides. The building contains eighteen vertical window bays each on the Pine and Cedar Street facades, and seven bays each on the Broadway and Nassau Street facades, three on each wing of the \\"H\\". The window bays each consist of two windows on each floor, except the center bay on Broadway and Nassau Street, which includes three windows on the 5th through 7th floors. The lowest four stories were made of granite, while the 5th through 7th stories have a facade of granite and terracotta. On Broadway and Nassau Street, there are Corinthian-style pilasters, which are tall and topped by ornamented capitals. Double-height arches with three revolving doors are located at the centers of these facades. Above this is a plaque reading on the third story, as well as an ornamented terracotta frieze at the fourth story, which is wide. The entrances on Cedar Street and Pine Street are more plainly designed with narrower square arches; the doors are located below green marble panels. The remaining windows on the first floor are stainless- steel show windows, which illuminate the commercial spaces inside. Though most of the commercial space is accessed from the lobby, there is also a service entrance and a shop entrance from the Cedar Street side. The window openings on the second, third, fifth, and sixth floors are separated by vertical mullions and horizontal spandrel panels made of green terracotta. Flagpoles hang from the seventh story. The 8th through 38th stories were made of light gray brick and matching terracotta trim. On the Broadway and Nassau Street facades, the light court divides the primary facades into two wings, each with three window bays. The portions of the facade facing these light courts are faced with brick. Medallions with cornices are located at the corners of the building at the 7th and 31st floors. There is no ornamentation on the 8th through 30th floors, while there are belt courses below the 31st and 32nd floors. The facade between the 32nd and 35th floors is composed of a colonnade with terracotta pilasters between each column of windows, topped by ornamented capitals. The colonnade terminates at the top of the 35th floor, where there is an elaborate cornice. Another belt course separates the 36th and 37th floors, and a cornice is located above the 38th floor. The top of the building, composed of the penthouse, is faced with brick and terracotta. It contains pilasters similar to the lower sections of the building. The main penthouse, atop the center of the \\"H\\", has dimensions of . Penthouses are located atop the wings as well. = Features = Upon its completion, the Equitable Building was the largest office building in the world by total area. The building had of floor space, and each of the upper stories has due to the H-shaped footprints. A fact sheet published at the time of the Equitable Building's completion estimated that it had approximately 5,000 windows and 10,000 doors.  Structural features  The foundations descended to below ground level. The foundation is surrounded by a concrete cofferdam which measures wide and is reinforced by steel rods. Within the foundation are eighty piers, each of made of concrete and steel. A retaining wall between Cedar and Pine Streets is used to reinforce two of the cellar levels for vaults. The superstructure weighs . At the time of the Equitable Building's construction, it was described as the world's heaviest structure. There are 88 granite columns that rest on the piers within the foundation, and another 50 columns that rest atop the cofferdam.  Interior  The ground-floor lobby is composed of two perpendicular arcades, a west-east corridor from Broadway to Nassau Street and a north-south corridor from Pine to Cedar Streets. All four entrances contained bronze revolving doors. The lobby has a pink marble floor, sand-colored marble walls, and a vaulted, coffered ceiling. The corridors are wide, while the ceiling ranges from tall at the edges to tall at the center. The ceiling is designed in patterns of octagons and squares. Also in the lobby are the elevators, which contain marble-and-bronze doors and are located in the central section of the \\"H\\". Banking spaces and storefronts are also located on the ground floor, accessible from the lobby. To the southeast and northwest, marble stairs with balustrades lead to the basements and second floor. The first basement level has safe-deposit vaults. In the basement, there are also connections to several New York City Subway stations, including Wall Street (served by the ), Wall Street (served by the ), and Broad Street (served by the ). On the upper floors, a staircase, restrooms, and utilities are clustered into the core of the \\"H\\". The light courts within the \\"H\\" ensured that all offices could receive natural light. West-east corridors ran perpendicularly to the elevator lobbies, crossing both wings of the \\"H\\". Floors were arranged so that they could be divided into suites facing outward, so that all suites faced windows, though it was also possible for lessees to rent entire floors. Upon the building's opening, Equitable also provided rest and recreation rooms for the building's 2,000 female employees, making it the first large building to have a women's welfare department. Also in the building was the library of the New York Law Institute, which remains in the building . The Equitable Building housed the 1,500-member Bankers Club on its top three floors when it opened. The club had five dining rooms, a lounge, reception rooms, and an open-air terrace. The club was highly frequented by notable financial figures and socialites in New York City, hosting politicians and leaders such as United Kingdom prime minister Winston Churchill, French president Charles de Gaulle, Soviet Union leader Nikita Khrushchev, and Queen of the United Kingdom Elizabeth II. It closed in 1979 after the club's lease expired. Operations The operations of the Equitable Building were described as being akin to a small city. When the building opened, there was a power station below ground level. It contained seven boilers with a combined output of , which took up a space measuring . There was also an artificial ice plant. The power station originally burned oil, consuming 2.5 million barrels per year, but started using coal in 1934 due to a rise in fuel prices. At the time of completion, the Equitable Building was said to have more telephones than did all of Greece. The building contains 50 elevators; the 48 elevators serving the above ground levels are clustered in six groups of eight, while an additional two elevators serve the basements. The Equitable Building previously contained as many as 62 elevators. History = Context = During the 19th century, life insurance firms were some of the first companies to build high-profile skyscrapers. The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, founded by Henry Baldwin Hyde in 1859, had built the Equitable Life Building on 120 Broadway in 1870. The Equitable Life Building was the first office building to feature passenger elevators, and at a record upon construction, was among the world's first skyscrapers. The building was expanded numerous times, including in 1875 and in 1887. Equitable assumed control of all properties on the block by 1906. By the 1890s, the Equitable Life Building was architecturally outdated, and George B. Post prepared plans for a 40-story structure in 1897, which did not proceed. In 1907, Daniel H. Burnham's company had proposed replacing the Equitable Life Building with a 33-story structure. At the time, both Burnham and Equitable publicly denied that a new home office was being planned. Burnham's firm filed plans for a 62-story building in 1908, to top the Singer Building and Metropolitan Life Tower. This new building would have had a 34-story base and a 28-story tower, being tall, with of floor area and 3,600 offices. Although bidding for the proposed structure began in December 1908, Equitable president Paul Morton publicly denied plans for a new structure. The plan was ultimately dropped, possibly due to opposition over the building's sheer bulk. 1912 fire The Equitable Life Building was destroyed by a fire on January 9, 1912, which killed six people. Fire engines could not save the structure because the water from the engines had frozen in the cold weather. Equitable quickly set up temporary quarters at the City Investing Building. Given that the previous building had been worth very little, the land was actually worth more after the fire than beforehand. = Planning and construction =  Planning  After the fire, Thompson‚ÄìStarrett was hired to clear the site, and the plot was chosen as the location for Equitable's new headquarters building. Thompson‚ÄìStarrett president Louis J. Horowitz approached businessman T. Coleman du Pont, who later recalled that du Pont was interested in the \\"idea of owning a gigantic building in New York\\". Frank M. Andrews‚Äîwho designed another one of du Pont's properties the Hotel McAlpin‚Äîwas also involved in the project. Horowitz, Andrews, and du Pont were said to have bought the lot in August 1912, and finalized the sale that October for $13.5 million. Du Pont forced Andrews from the project, apparently upon Horowitz's advice, and Andrews sued du Pont in July 1913, leading du Pont to pay Andrews $100,000 for his involvement. Horowitz then corresponded with Ernest Graham, the other major partner at D. H. Burnham & Company after Burnham's June 1912 death, who would become the architect of the new tower. Graham designed the structure as a bulky mass, wanting to maximize the amount of office space on the site rather than a corporate symbol. Graham's key concern was with the height of the elevators, and he discussed the issue with preeminent elevator engineer Charles E. Knox, who said that \\"the elevator service will determine the height of the building\\". This differed from Graham's previous commissions, where elevators were considered after the height of the building was specified. Knox ultimately recommended against building a 42-story structure, but recommended a 36-story edifice since that height could meet the client's safety and speed criteria. Opposition to the building soon coalesced. One group of bankers planned to build a park on the site, a suggestion that Horowitz said \\"outranks, for nerve, anything of which I ever heard\\", and was dropped when Horowitz suggested that the group raise $13.5 million to buy out du Pont's ownership share. Another proposal called for dividing the lot in half by extending New Street, an existing north-south road, north to Cedar Street. This plan also failed, and blueprints were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in December 1912, which called for a huge H-shaped edifice on the block. On April 12, 1913, du Pont formed the Equitable Office Building Corporation to take title to the building site, and gave Equitable a $20.5 million mortgage loan to run for 60 years. Equitable would lease three floors in exchange for 9% dividends in the building corporation, to be paid in perpetuity. Equitable president William A. Day was appointed as chairman of the board of the building corporation. Thompson‚ÄìStarrett was hired as the builder and Horowitz became the \\"owner's representative\\".  Construction  The Equitable Building in a postcard dated from before 1919 Because of the high land cost, the developers wanted to erect the building as quickly as possible; at the time, buildings' general contractors usually passed work down to subcontractors. To eliminate delays due to a lack of communication between subcontractors, the building corporation formed a \\"Method of Procedure\\" to coordinate all work on the building. Since there were no nearby material-storage areas, it was imperative that work be completed as quickly as possible. The start of work had already been held up by opposition to the proposed height and shape. Excavation for the building started in June 1913. The cofferdam around the foundation was initially reinforced with timber cross-bracing until the steel frame underground had been sufficiently completed to support the cofferdam. During excavation, a cannonball from British colonial times was excavated from the site of the Equitable Building. By January 1914, crews had excavated the foundation and dug to the bedrock below street level. The steel work was built to the second floor using six derricks; the steel frame above that point was erected using lighter derricks with longer masts and booms. There were some accidents during construction, including two incidents in which workers were killed. One worker died after a crane fell on the Broadway side of the building, while another died when a crane dropped a girder onto a platform where six men were working. The steel frame reached street level in February 1914. The cornerstone was officially laid on April 30, 1914, at a ceremony attended by mayor John Purroy Mitchel. The Equitable Building was the first private construction project in New York City where the mayor attended the cornerstone-laying ceremony. Work on the superstructure officially began on June 10, 1914. By August 16, the structure had topped out at 38 stories above the ground level.These 38 floors included the interior floors (not visible from the facade) but excluded the two-story penthouse. Work on the building was completed on February 1, 1915. = Use = The Equitable Building was completed on May 1, 1915, at an estimated cost of $29 million, . The Equitable Society itself occupied , a little more than 10% of the total floor area, on the sixth through eighth floors. Other early lessees included tenants as diverse as General Electric, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fidelity Trust Company, and American Smelting & Refining. The Equitable Building was also occupied by industrial concerns such as the American Can Company, Kennecott Copper Company, E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and Aluminum Company of America, as well as railroads such as Missouri Pacific Railroad, Union Pacific Railroad, and Southern Railway. The Equitable Building's other tenants included banks such as Barclays, Marine Midland Bank, and Mellon Bank; financial firms such as Kidder, Peabody & Co. and American Express; and the offices of New York attorney general Robert Abrams. Equitable Life itself only had its home office in the Equitable Building until 1924, when it moved to 393 Seventh Avenue (now 11 Penn Plaza).  1910s through 1930s  Seen from Cedar and Nassau Streets At the time of its completion, the Equitable Building had 20,000 employees working inside it, and 50,000 additional daily visitors. Shortly after the official opening, du Pont bought the Equitable Life Assurance Company's controlling interest. During the first year of operation, du Pont made $3 million in profit. By 1917, the building was fully occupied at an average rental rate of . The building's valuation was increased from $20.5 million to $25 million that year, because of a prosperous realty market at the time. The following year, the Equitable Office Building Corporation applied for a reduction in the building's valuation from $25 million to $18 million, due to foreclosures on other large buildings in New York City. Further devaluation occurred in 1921, when the building was estimated to be worth $11.5 million, but by the next year, the building was re-valued at $30 million, making it among the city's most valuable properties. The edifice was first placed for sale in 1923, with du Pont offering the building for $40 million. In 1925, du Pont sold the Equitable Building for $38.5 million to the New York Empire Company, a subsidiary of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The next year, the Brotherhood sold the building to a syndicate composed of William Henry Vanderbilt, Harry C. Cushing III, and Leroy W. Baldwin for $40 million. By 1928, the Equitable Building was assessed at $31 million, making it the highest-valued building in New York City.  1940s through 1970s  By the 1940s, the Equitable Office Building Corporation was in poor financial shape. Bankruptcy proceedings started in 1940, but were delayed due to World War II; three potential investors submitted dueling proposals in 1946. The building was refinanced in 1947, receiving a first-mortgage loan of $14.5 million, among the largest ever in New York City's history. At this time, Equitable Life sold the mortgage on the tower. In 1954, Webb and Knapp bought all of the Equitable Office Building Corporation's common stock, and thereby acquired ownership of the building. Lawrence Wien bought the lease for the land in 1956, though Webb and Knapp retained ownership of the building as well as its operating sublease. By then, Equitable was planning to build the new 1285 Avenue of the Americas on Sixth Avenue between 51st and 52nd streets in Midtown Manhattan. Two years later, the Equitable Life Assurance Company bought the building outright, as part of a $25 million exchange wherein Webb and Knapp bought the Sixth Avenue plot. In addition, Wien assumed the building's operating sublease the same year. Equitable moved to 1285 Avenue of the Americas in 1961 from its previous home office at 393 Seventh Avenue.  1980s to present  Silverstein Properties purchased the Equitable Building in 1980 for $60 million, in partnership with five pension funds whose mortgage nearly covered the purchase price. After buying the building, Larry Silverstein renovated and restored it at a cost of $30 million, to a design by Ehrenkrantz, Eckstut & Whitelaw. The project entailed replacing the terracotta ornamentation, as well as the original terracotta frames for the windows, which was replaced with glass-fiber reinforced plastic. The window sash and main entrances were also replaced, and the lobby was refurbished. The renovation was completed in 1990. As a result of the project, occupancy rates increased from 60% in 1991 to 80% in 1993. Following the early 1990s recession, Silverstein sold his ownership stake and leased the Equitable Building, though Silverstein Properties bought it back in 1999. In 2017, Silverstein announced another round of renovations, which cost $50 million and were undertaken by Beyer Blinder Belle. The plan included restoring many historic features including the glass mosaic at the front entrance, the chandeliers in the lobby, and reopening the Bankers Club at the top of the building as an amenity space. The renovation also created twin rooftop terraces spanning a combined . The renovation was completed in July 2019. Several murals resembling street art were installed on the third floor in November 2019. Tenants include the New York City Department of City Planning, Macmillan Publishers, architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  Notable incidents  There were numerous incidents where parts of the building were damaged. For instance, lightning caused part of the cornice to break off during 1925. In March 1942, a seven-inch (17 cm) shell struck the 37th floor of the building but caused little damage and no injuries. The shell was one of eight fired by an anti-aircraft battery near the East River by mistake; the other rounds fell harmlessly into the river. The 1942 incident made the Equitable Building the first in New York City to suffer war damage during World War II, and it subsequently took out an insurance policy. In February 1953, a broken water main flooded the basements with of water, temporarily disabling the elevators. Throughout the Equitable Building's history, several people have died after they fell or jumped from the building. In the building's early years, such incidents included a clerk who landed on a taxi in 1925; a woman who jumped from the roof after losing money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929; a broker who jumped in 1937; and an incident in 1930 where a jumper killed both himself and a truck driver on the ground. There were also several people who killed themselves inside the building, such as the shooting suicide of a politician in 1933 and another one in 1937.  Influence  = Critical reception = Many architectural critics had negative comments about the Equitable Building. Francisco Mujica stated in 1927 that \\"its intelligent interior arrangement and the central location of its 50 elevators\\" was the only appealing part of the Equitable Building. Another critic called it a \\"monstrous parasite on the veins and arteries of New York\\". Sally A. Kitt Chappell wrote that the Equitable Building \\"was tall but without the redeeming slender, spirelike quality of a tower, and yet its height prevented it from having the urbanistic decorum of an office block\\". However, Chappell also wrote that the building had \\"mitigate[d] two of the major evils of which skyscrapers were accused, as its fireproofing and elevator service attest.\\" There was also significant resistance to the building's shape. Opponents stated that the building also overwhelmed nearby infrastructure by blocking ventilation, straining nearby transit facilities, and preventing firemen from easily reaching the upper floors. The shadow was more than six times the lot area and up to long. One journal stated that it cast a shadow on the surrounding streets, including a permanent shadow on the Singer Building up to its 27th floor and the City Investing Building up to its 24th floor, and completely cutting off sunshine to at least three other adjacent buildings shorter than 21 stories. Even during the cornerstone laying, mayor Mitchel had alluded to the possibility that the Equitable Building might be the last bulky skyscraper to be erected in New York City. = Impact on zoning law = The Equitable Building in 2011, showing the effect of pre-zoning skyscrapers when seen from the sidewalk The Equitable Building's construction was one of the influences behind the passage of zoning reform in New York City. The AIA Guide to New York City described the building as \\"more famous for what it caused than what it is\\", although the Equitable Building was only one of the several catalysts of such reform. Opposition to super-tall buildings dated as far back as 1894. Early attempts by Ernest Flagg to limit the height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the city's property market entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The Committee on Congestion of Population in New York, as well as the Fifth Avenue Association, were among the groups that advocated for such legislation to limit building heights. The New York City Board of Aldermen's Building Commission had published preliminary reports for zoning controls in 1913, when the Equitable Building was barely under construction. Nevertheless, in the following years, opponents of super-tall skyscrapers frequently cited the Equitable Building's bulk. After the Equitable Building's completion, numerous nearby property owners filed for reduced property valuation assessments on the basis that significant rental income had been taken by the shadow that the building cast. Following the public criticism of the Equitable Building, the real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed. The legislation limited the height and required setbacks for new buildings to allow the penetration of sunlight to street level. New buildings were thus required to withdraw progressively at a defined angle from the street as they rose, in order to preserve sunlight and the open atmosphere in their surroundings. Chappell writes that if the Equitable Building were completed after the resolution's passage, it would have had two setbacks below the 18th floor, and the building above that point would have been a small tower. The effort to place restrictions on land use in New York City led to the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act, a nationwide zoning legislation. The subsequent 1961 Zoning Resolution allowed the construction of bulky towers if they contained plazas. = Landmark status = The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Equitable Building a New York City landmark in 1996. Silverstein supported the city designation, and the commission wrote in its report that the Equitable Building was \\"one of the finest office buildings of the era\\".

Life and career Kikuchi was born in Edo (present- day Tokyo), as the second son of Mitsukuri Sh≈´hei, himself the adopted son of Mitsukuri Gempo, a Shogunate professor. Kikuchi Dairoku changed his name from Mitsukuri upon succeeding as the heir to his father's original family; the requisite legal procedures were completed in 1877.Japanese Students at Cambridge University in the Meiji Era, 1868‚Äì1912, pg 66, Noboru Koyama After attending the Bansho Shirabesho, the Shogunal institute for western studies, he was sent to Great Britain, in 1866, at age 11, the youngest of a group of Japanese sent by the Tokugawa shogunate to the University College School, on the advice of the then British foreign minister Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby. Kikuchi returned to England in 1870 and was the first Japanese student to graduate from the University of Cambridge (St. John's College) and the only one to graduate from the University of London in the 19th century.. Venn also lists him under the name 'Dairoku, Yasu-Yuki Kikuchi'. In one case his birth date is given as 17 May 1855; in the other as 17 March 1855. His specialisation was in physics and mathematics. In 1884 he attended the International Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C. and the master class of Kelvin in Baltimore. After returning to Japan, Kikuchi later became president of Tokyo Imperial University, Minister of Education (1901‚Äì1903,) and president of Kyoto Imperial University. In 1909 he lectured in London on Japanese EducationBaron Kikuchi (1909) Japanese Education via Internet Archive and 1910 at New York on New Japan: Its Intellectual and Moral Development.Baron Kikuchi (1910) New Japan: Its Intellectual and Moral Development His textbook on elementary geometry was the most widely used geometry textbook in Japan until the end of World War II. Kikuchi was made a baron under the kazoku peerage system in 1902 and was the eighth president of the Gakush≈´in Peers' School. In 1917 he became the first president of RIKEN, but died that same year. Mitsukuri family Kikuchi was a member of one of Japan's most distinguished and outstanding families of scholars, the Mitsukuri family, at the centre of Japan's educational system in the Meiji Era. His grandfather had been a student of Dutch studies (\\"rangaku\\"). His father Mitsukuri Shuhei had taught at the Bansho-shirabesho (Institute for Investigating Barbarian Books). His children were famous scientists, and his grandson Minobe Ry≈çkichi became governor of Tokyo.

It usually concerns feelings from a primary relationship during childhood. At times, this transference can be considered inappropriate.Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (8th ed. 1976).Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language (2nd College Ed. 1970). Transference was first described by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, who considered it an important part of psychoanalytic treatment.  Occurrence  It is common for people to transfer feelings about their parents to their partners or children (that is, cross-generational entanglements). Another example of transference would be a person mistrusting somebody who resembles an ex-spouse in manners, voice, or external appearance, or being overly compliant to someone who resembles a childhood friend. In The Psychology of the Transference, Carl Jung states that within the transference dyad both participants typically experience a variety of opposites, that in love and in psychological growth, the key to success is the ability to endure the tension of the opposites without abandoning the process, and that this tension allows one to grow and to transform.Jung, Carl C. The Psychology of the Transference, Princeton University Press, Only in a personally or socially harmful context can transference be described as a pathological issue. A modern, social- cognitive perspective on transference explains how it can occur in everyday life. When people meet a new person who reminds them of someone else, they unconsciously infer that the new person has traits similar to the person previously known.Andersen, S. M. & Berk., M. (1998). The social-cognitive model of transference: Experiencing past relationships in the present. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 7(4), 109-115. This perspective has generated a wealth of research that illuminated how people tend to repeat relationship patterns from the past in the present. High-profile serial killers often transfer unresolved rage toward previous love or hate-objects onto \\"surrogates\\", or individuals resembling or otherwise calling to mind the original object of that hate. It is believed in the instance of Ted Bundy, he repeatedly killed brunette women who reminded him of a previous girlfriend with whom he had become infatuated, but who had ended the relationship, leaving Bundy rejected and pathologically rageful (Bundy, however, denied this as a motivating factor in his crimes).\\"Michaud, Stephen G., & Aynesworth, H. (2000). Ted Bundy: Conversations with a Killer, Dallas: Authorlink. This notwithstanding, Bundy's behavior could be considered pathological insofar as he may have had narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder.Describing Ted Bundy‚Äôs Personality and Working towards DSM-V. Douglas B. Samuel and Thomas A. Widiger. Department of Psychology at the University of Kentucky.Independent Practitioner (2007), 27 (1), pp. 20‚Äì22. If so, normal transference mechanisms cannot be held causative of his homicidal behavior. Sigmund Freud held that transference plays a large role in male homosexuality. In The Ego and the Id, he claimed that eroticism between males can be an outcome of a \\"[psychically] non-economic\\" hostility, which is unconsciously subverted into love and sexual attraction.Freud, S. (1960). The ego and the id. J. Strachey (Ed.). (J. Riviere, Trans.). New York: W.W. Norton. (Original work published 1923)  Transference and countertransference during psychotherapy  In a therapy context, transference refers to redirection of a patient's feelings for a significant person to the therapist. Transference is often manifested as an erotic attraction towards a therapist, but can be seen in many other forms such as rage, hatred, mistrust, parentification, extreme dependence, or even placing the therapist in a god-like or guru status. When Freud initially encountered transference in his therapy with patients, he thought he was encountering patient resistance, as he recognized the phenomenon when a patient refused to participate in a session of free association. But what he learned was that the analysis of the transference was actually the work that needed to be done: \\"the transference, which, whether affectionate or hostile, seemed in every case to constitute the greatest threat to the treatment, becomes its best tool\\".Sigmund Freud, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (PFL 1) p. 496 The focus in psychodynamic psychotherapy is, in large part, the therapist and patient recognizing the transference relationship and exploring the relationship's meaning. Since the transference between patient and therapist happens on an unconscious level, psychodynamic therapists who are largely concerned with a patient's unconscious material use the transference to reveal unresolved conflicts patients have with childhood figures. CountertransferenceHoracio Etchegoyen: The Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique, Karnac Books ed., New Ed, 2005, is defined as redirection of a therapist's feelings toward a patient, or more generally, as a therapist's emotional entanglement with a patient. A therapist's attunement to their own countertransference is nearly as critical as understanding the transference. Not only does this help therapists regulate their emotions in the therapeutic relationship, but it also gives therapists valuable insight into what patients are attempting to elicit in them. For example, a therapist who is sexually attracted to a patient must understand the countertransference aspect (if any) of the attraction, and look at how the patient might be eliciting this attraction. Once any countertransference aspect has been identified, the therapist can ask the patient what his or her feelings are toward the therapist, and can explore how those feelings relate to unconscious motivations, desires, or fears. Another contrasting perspective on transference and countertransference is offered in classical Adlerian psychotherapy. Rather than using the patient's transference strategically in therapy, the positive or negative transference is diplomatically pointed out and explained as an obstacle to cooperation and improvement. For the therapist, any signs of countertransference would suggest that his or her own personal training analysis needs to be continued to overcome these tendencies. Andrea Celenza noted in 2010 that \\"the use of the analyst's countertransference remains a point of controversy\\".

In 2015, he was elected to lead Iran's Assembly of Experts, defeating Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president, by a vote count of 47 to 24. Early life Mohammad Yazdi was born in 1931 to a religious family at Isfahan. Sheikh Ali Yazdi, his father, was a student of Sheikh Abdul Karim Haeri and at one of the Isfahan mosques as chief mullah for Friday prayers and ceremonies investigated the people problems.Although his name resembles to Mohammad Taqi Mesbah Yazdi,the two man are not related. =Educational= At first, Ayatollah Yazdi learned Persian language from his father and then went to Maktab. Also he departed to newly founded school to continue his educational. When he went to Qom, he resided at the Feyziyeh School and learned religious courses from scholars such as Mohammad Ali Araki, Ayatollah Sheikh Muhammad Taqi Amoli, Ayatollah Shahroudi, Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi and Imam Khomeini. Political career =Before victory of Iranian Revolution= Ayatollah Yazdi usually gave the lectures at mosques and house of scholars. Also he taught Morality course at the Feyziyeh School and discussed about politic subjects. Mohammad Yazdi was exiled by SAVAK many times to Bandar Lengeh, Bushire and Rudbar. =After victory of Iranian Revolution= After Khamenei became leader of the Iranian Republic, Ayatollah Yazdi served as the president of the Supreme Court. He remained in the post for many years before being replaced by Muhammad Hashemi shahreoudi. Yazdi was a member of the Assembly of Experts and the Guardian Council. He served as the interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran. There is some of the Political career of Ayatollah Yazdi after Iranian Revolution as fallowing: *Management of Imam khomeini's Office in Qom *Member of the dispute resolution council between Mohammad-Ali Rajai and Abolhassan Banisadr *Member of the Assembly of Experts constitution in 1358 *Chief mullah for Friday prayers of Tehran in 1360 *Chief Justice of Iran 1368 to 1378 *Member of the Assembly of Experts since 1369 *Member of Iranian Parliament from 1361 to 1368 in Qom and Tehran *Vice chairman of Iranian Parliament in the first and second periods *Member of Guardian Council in the periods of the second, fourth, fifth and sixth *One of the founders and secretary of Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom Political views =United States= In the run-up to the February 2016 elections, Yazdi opposed bilateral relations with the United States. In the popular election held in February 2016 for Assembly of Experts candidates, incumbent Chairman Yazdi was not among the 16 experts who received enough votes to represent Tehran in the Fifth Assembly of Experts. Many western media outlets pointed to Yazdi's exit from the Assembly when providing emphasizing the gains that reformists made in the 2016 elections. In a speech congratulating those elected to the Fifth Assembly of Experts, Yazdi advocated for peaceful, moderate relations with other countries, but went on to warn about dealing with enemies and characterized America as \\"The Great Satan\\". Two days later, Fars News Agency reported the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei lamented the Assembly's loss of Yazdi as Chairman and warned of the risk that the West could influence or infiltrate Iran. As of 9 May 2016, Yazdi remained on the Guardian Council, which vets potential candidates for the Assembly of Experts. During Yazdi's tenure on the Guardian Council, human-rights organizations have criticized the Guardian Council's disqualification of reform candidates in the 2016 elections. Sanctions In February 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Yazdi for \\"preventing free and fair elections in Iran.\\" Work Ayatollah Yazdi authored several books in English and Persian such as, Your missing, Answers of Mardooq's accusations and Imamah in Shia Islam.

It was shut down on 2 March 2002, and was replaced by BBC Four. History =Launch= The BBC had been wanting to expand into the digital television market for a number of years prior to BBC Knowledge's launch. Originally this was by their association with Flextech, which spawned the UKTV network. Both companies had different ideas on how the new channels would be run: the BBC wanted the channels branded as BBC channels, but Flextech wanted the channels to contain advertising. The BBC refused, stating that no domestic BBC channel should carry advertising, and in the end a compromise was made. Two of the channels would launch as BBC channels, the soon to be BBC Choice and the then called BBC Learning, with the remainder of the channels being launched as the UKTV network, intended to be BBC in all but name. Prior to the launch, the channel changed name from BBC Learning to BBC Knowledge.BBC unveils digital TV BBC News, 21 September 1998 The channel launched on 1 June 1999,BBC launches digital learning channel BBC News, 30 May 1999 broadcasting for six hours each day. The new channel had plans to be a new, multimedia channel, operating across television, online and on interactive television, and showing educational and informative programming. The channel's original schedule style was initially a 'bright and breezy' approach to education, aimed at both adults and children, with viewers encouraged to get involved and contribute to the programming. Original programme included a GCSE survival guide based upon the popular BBC series \\"Bitesize\\", entitled \\"Bitesize Etc\\" and the technology series The Kit, aimed at children and getting them online and embracing digital. =Relaunch= A few years into the channel's existence, it was becoming clear that the channel's original format was not working in its aim of interacting with viewers and making learning fun. The channel was receiving consistently poor ratings, and the BBC decided to relaunch the channel. The relaunched channel was given a new visual identity, and became from 17 November 2001, a 24-hour channel, caused by the move of BBC Knowledge from the SDN to the BBC multiplex on the DTT service. In addition to this, the format was changed to a serious, documentary channel with scheduling arranged into 'zones' depending on topics.BBC Knowledge 1999-2002 TV & Radio BitsBBC Knowledge Launch Schedule TV & Radio Bits =Closure= However, the real reason for the shift in programming was because the incumbent government delayed approving new BBC digital plans. BBC Three and Four were planned to have launched in 2001 but because of the plans being delayed, instead the BBC decided to relaunch the two channels in the meantime with the new programming. It had been planned since October 2000 that Knowledge would be replaced with BBC Four. Eventually the new digital plans were approved. In February 2002 the hours were cut back for CBeebies to launch. BBC Knowledge was closed down in the final hours of 2 March 2002. BBC Knowledge from mid-2001 was essentially a test platform for the style of the new channel. Visual identity Launch identity showing the \\"ladders of learning\\" The launch identity consisted of cartoon characters climbing 'ladders of learning' between clouds against an orange background. Illustrator Michael Sheehy designed the idents. A white, BBC logo with 'Knowledge' after it in capital letters was located at the bottom of the screen. The ident image would also be present in the background of the end promotions, channel menus advertising upcoming programmes, and in video links presented by members of the public. In addition to this, a DOG was used on the channel, located in the top left of the screen, which displayed the web address for the channel, linking in with the interactive learning element, however this was replaced with the BBC Knowledge logo before too long. Later on, the idents changed to follow a strand layout, with different idents for each strand. These featured an object, before a fact about it related to the strand appears and ends on an image with the strand name shown clearly on screen, with a letter encircled at the centre of the screen. It is unclear whether these idents were replacements of the animated idents, or complementary to them, however it appears they complemented them, with these idents being used in the stranded sections, with the animated idents used for general interest programming. Following the relaunch in 2001, all different idents were dropped in favour of a single ident, featuring numerous circles made out of different structures reflecting the new strands.

C. B., \\"Andre Chapelon 1892-1978 Le genie francais de la vapeur\\" (1992, CNRS Editions)(). A graduate engineer of Ecole Centrale Paris, he was one of very few locomotive designers who brought a rigorous scientific method to their design, and he sought to apply up-to-date theories and knowledge in subjects such as thermodynamics, and gas and fluid flow. Chapelon's work was an early example of what would later be called modern steam,http://5at.co.uk/index.php/modern-steam-2/andre- chapelon.htmlhttp://www.trainweb.org/tusp/back.html and influenced the work of many later designers of those locomotives, such as Livio Dante Porta. Life and career Andr√© Xavier Chapelon was born in Saint-Paul-en-Cornillon, Loire, France on 26 October 1892. According to family relatives, his great- grandfather James Jackson immigrated to France from England in 1812, one of many who came to France in the 19th Century to teach steel production methods. He achieved a distinction in mathematics and science, and served as an artillery officer during World War I before returning to the √âcole centrale Paris in 1919, from which he graduated as Ing√©nieur des Arts et Manufactures in 1921. He joined the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (PLM) as a probationer in the Rolling Stock and Motive Power section at Lyon- Mouche depot. However, foreseeing poor prospects, he left in 1924 and joined the Soci√©t√© Industrielle des Telephones, soon becoming as assistant manager. In 1925, he joined the Chemin de Fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (PO) and, along with Finnish Engineer Ky√∂sti Kyl√§l√§, jointly designed the Kylchap exhaust system. While his principles met with scepticism, No. 3566, the first locomotive rebuilt to Chapelon's design, was an outstanding success, and from 1929 to 1936 several other locomotives were rebuilt to Chapelon's designs. In 1934, Chapelon was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and awarded both the Plumey Prize of the Acad√©mie des Sciences and the Gold Medal of the Soci√©t√© d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale. From 1938 he published the book for which he is most noted La locomotive √† vapeur. On 13 September 1971 Chapelon was made Vice-President of the Stephenson Locomotive Society in a ceremony in Paris. Chapelon's methods He tested his experimental designs thoroughly to understand how they actually behaved, using the most accurate and complete testing and sensing equipment available, such as high-speed stroboscopic photography to watch steam flow. Before Chapelon, few engineers and designers tried to understand why a certain design worked better than another--they merely worked by trial and error, trying to replicate the attributes of previous locomotives by rule of thumb, by guesswork, and from empirical theories and design rules that had rarely been given adequate testing. =Efficiency= Efficiency was one of Chapelon's primary concerns in design. Some of his locomotives exceeded 12% efficiency, which for a steam locomotive was exceptional. With greater efficiency, Chapelon could achieve greater power in a smaller locomotive that burned less coal, rather than simply enlarging a locomotive for more power. =Compounding and steam flow= He was a major proponent of the compound locomotive, and from 1929 on he rebuilt many de Glehn compounds, designed by Alfred de Glehn, with his system of compounding. His other major work included optimising the steam circuit, including improving the steam flow by widening steam passages and paths, improving the flow through valve gear, and improved exhaust systems such as his Kylchap exhaust. =Wheel and rail= Chapelon realised that in order to produce an efficient, powerful locomotive, every aspect of it had to be improved and dealt with scientifically. He studied locomotive behaviour at speed and the riding properties of the steel wheel on steel rail; his knowledge was put to use much later on the French TGV high speed trains. Problems Despite his abilities and track record, he was never presented the opportunity to design a class of entirely-new locomotives that were produced in any numbers. He was continually stymied by railway management and politicians, and often his superbly performing locomotives were treated as embarrassments by his superiors, because they showed up the poor performance of the officially-approved locomotives. Chapelon's legacy Chapelon's work lived on in the work of his friend and prot√©g√© Livio Dante Porta of Argentina, and others, and he was accorded the rare honour for a foreign railwayman of having a British Rail Class 86 electric locomotive named for him. Although many of Chapelon's contemporaries did not adopt his methods, a few did. One notable such designer was Nigel Gresley of the British London and North Eastern Railway, who experimentally used Chapelon's Kylchap exhaust system on a small number of LNER Class A4 locomotives, including the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard, which set what most historians accept as the world record for speed for steam locomotives in 1938. Czech locomotive designers at the ≈†koda Works watched Chapelon's work, especially when construction commenced on ƒåSD class 476.0 locomotive, the last compound locomotive of Czech origin. They consulted Chapelon during construction, and he visited Czechoslovakia. Chapelon published numerous works on steam locomotive design,http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81-32102 although only his most famous work (La locomotive a vapeur, described above) has been translated into English. Chapelon's locomotives =French locomotives= The first locomotive rebuilt to incorporate Chapelon's work was PO 4-6-2 3566, which was released from Tours works in November 1929. As a result of this, three further series of Pacifics were similarly modified. This was followed by a more comprehensive rebuild of Pacific 4521 as a 4-8-0, which was completed in August 1932. The success of that work led to eleven more rebuilds to locomotives numbered 4701-4712 (later 240 701 - 240 712). Those locomotives produced almost 40 indicated horsepower (ihp) continuous per metric ton locomotive weight, which probably still is a world record. In 1936, Chapelon began the rebuild of a PO 6000 class 2-10-0 as a 2-12-0, with two high- pressure cylinders between the 2nd and 3rd coupled axles mounted behind four low-pressure cylinders. That unusual cylinder arrangement was required due to the loading gauge being too narrow to accommodate two low-pressure cylinders with the required volume to fully expand the low-pressure steam. There was also an additional level of \\"superheat\\" between the high- and low-pressure cylinders, allowing the loco to achieve a tractive effort of 83700 lb. The 242 A 1 was perhaps the pinnacle of Chapelon's development of the steam locomotive. The 4-8-4 was a rebuild of Etat 4-8-2 241.101, which retained the 3-cylinder layout, changed it into a 3-cylinder compound system, and introduced more of Chapelon's improvements, including a triple Kylchap exhaust, double high-pressure valves and Willoteaux valves on the low-pressure cylinders. Completed in 1946, and with a continuous power output of 5500 ihp, the locomotive was rather more powerful than contemporary French electric locomotives, resulting in a hasty redesign of subsequent electric locos, increasing their power by another . However, the locomotive was scrapped in 1960. The SNCF 240P class is considered by some to be among Chapelon's best designs, and was the most thermally-efficient locomotive in the world at its time. According to some, it was equal in efficiency to early diesel locomotives of its time.http://www.asterhobby.com/history03.html =Exported locomotives= The only locomotives Chapelon designed for use outside France were some metre gauge 2-8-4 and 4-8-4 locomotives for GELSA (Groupement d'Exportation de Locomotives S.A.) for export to Brazil. They were highly advanced locomotives with many modern American appliances, as well as Chapelon's innovations. He was a great admirer of American industrial capacities and the resulting high quality of its engineering,http://thierry.stora.free.fr/english/achap_01.htm even though his work tended to be ignored in the USA. =Proposed Designs= Chapelon had several designs of standardised locomotive on the drawing board, starting with his time at P.O.Midi. Entirely new designs were drawn following his exposure to American ideas, with a visit to the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) works in Schenectady, New York, and after experience with the operating characteristics of 242A1 became known. They were planned to be 3-cylinder Sauvage compound locomotives, with a large, 6m2 (65 sq. ft) grate area, for duties that required high horsepower, and were to be complemented by 2-cylinder simple expansion 2-8-0 and 2-10-0 designs for less-demanding duties. The 152 (2-10-4) locomotive design had two frames partially constructed, before the decision was made to electrify the SNCF and phase out steam. As a result, the frames were scrapped before completion.

It has 13,000 full-time students, including 3,600 international students from 85 countries, across seven campuses, the largest being in Barrie. History The college was established during the formation of Ontario's college system in 1967. Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965 when the Ontario system of public colleges was created. Programs Georgian College offers academic upgrading, apprenticeship training, certificate, diploma, graduate certificate, college degree and university programs (including combined degree-diplomas) and part- time studies in such areas such as automotive business, business and management, community safety, computer studies, design and visual arts, engineering technology and environmental studies, health, wellness and sciences, hospitality, tourism and recreation, human services, Indigenous studies, liberal arts, marine studies, and skilled trades. Classes are small (26 people on average). Georgian offers the following degrees: * Honours Bachelor of Business Administration (Automotive Management) * Honours Bachelor of Business Administration (Management and Leadership) * Honours Bachelor of Business Administration (Golf Management) * Honours Bachelor of Interior Design * Honours Bachelor of Police Studies * Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Collaborative Program) Georgian partners with Lakehead University to deliver degree-diploma programs. Students obtain both a diploma and a degree in four years of study. Two of these programs began in September 2017, and two more started in September 2018. Two offer a co-op option. Current Lakehead-Georgian degree-diploma programs are: * Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical) Degree with Electrical Engineering Technology Advanced Diploma * Honours Bachelor of Arts and Science ‚Äì Environmental Sustainability (Specialization in Ecosystem Management) Degree with Environmental Technician Diploma * Honours Bachelor of Science ‚Äì Applied Life Sciences (Specialization in Biomedical Techniques) Degree with Biotechnology-Health Diploma * Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Degree with Computer Programmer Diploma Georgian's University Partnership Centre offers a means of earning university degrees, college degrees, combined degree-diplomas and graduate certificate programs. Degrees currently offered in partnership with other institutions (aside from Lakehead University) include: *Central Michigan University: Master of Arts in Education, Community College Concentration *University of Ontario Institute of Technology: RPN-BScN Degree Completion *York University: Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Collaborative Program) The college also currently has more than 780 articulation and transfer agreements with 59 institutions around the world. = Entrepreneurship = Georgian offers a special focus on entrepreneurship. The Henry Bernick Entrepreneurship Centre, at the college's Barrie Campus, assists entrepreneurs in four main areas: training, connections, funding and mentorship. Georgian also trains students in social entrepreneurship. In 2018 it became the first college in Canada to be designated a \\"changemaker college\\" by Ashoka U = Co-op education = Georgian has more than 5,000 students enrolled in co-op programs. A total of 6,200 employers partner with Georgian to offer student work experiences (such as PowerStream, Algoma Central Corporation, Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre and more). Georgian was the first Ontario college with programs accredited by Co-operative Education and Work-Integrated Learning Canada; this represents the highest standard of achievement for co-op programs in Canada. Co-op work terms can lead to full-time positions after graduation. Students may opt to be their own boss and start a business as part of Georgian's eCo-op (entrepreneurship co-op) program. Georgian has maintained a high graduate employment rate for more than a decade. According to 2018 key performance indicators, 90.3% of Georgian graduates found work within six months ‚Äì well above the provincial average. = Cancellation of planned program in homeopathy = In February 2018, the college announced that it was cancelling its controversial advanced diploma program in homeopathy, citing \\"the recent response from our local community and beyond and in consideration of our students.\\" The program had been approved by the Georgian College board of governors and the Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development. Dr. Chris Giorshev, an emergency medicine physician, had sent letters of protest to the college and to the provincial government. He worried there would be a risk to public health if people assumed homeopathy has some legitimacy. \\"In this day and age with everything we know about science, that a discredited 200-year-old bit of puffery should be legitimized is scandalous,\\" said Joe Schwarcz, director of McGill University's Office of Science and Society. Scholarships and bursaries Georgian offers more than $3 million in bursaries and scholarships to students each year. Students can apply online. The Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 750 scholarships, bursaries, bursaries and other incentives offered by governments, universities and industry to support Aboriginal postsecondary participation. Georgian College scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and M√©tis students include the Casino Rama Aboriginal Tourism Award, Casino Rama Tourism Graduate Award, Monague Native Crafts Ltd. Award, Crossworks Manufacturing Native Education Award, Randy Anderson Memorial Award, New VR Award, Janet Stinson Memorial Award, and Native Education ‚Äì Community and Social Development Graduate Award.Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool Campuses =Barrie= Georgian College's main campus is located on a site on the northeast edge of Barrie. The Barrie Campus is home to the University Partnership Centre, offering degree studies and combined degree- diploma programs. The Barrie Campus is also home to the Sadlon Centre for Health, Wellness and Sciences. Opened in 2011, this $65-million, facility has allowed Georgian to double its enrolment in health and wellness programs to 3,000 students and allow students to pursue health sciences-related certificates, diplomas and degrees, including advanced degree programs. It is home to a variety of health care teaching clinics open to the public, as well as laboratories and classrooms. The new Peter B. Moore Advanced Technology Centre is a $30-million, 56,000-square-foot facility at the Barrie Campus. It is home to the first engineering degrees in Central Ontario, Lakehead-Georgian degree-diploma programs, and labs with emerging robotics, mechatronics, and manufacturing technology. It has the only anechoic chamber in the region. Students and faculty use the space to partner with industry and community partners on research projects. Georgian also offers graphic design and photography programs in downtown Barrie, at the Arch and Helen Brown Design and Digital Arts Centre. A bus runs regularly between Georgian's downtown Barrie and north Barrie locations. The Barrie Campus offers an on-campus residence. The eight-floor residence houses approximately 525 students, which includes 16 live-in residence life staff (15 Resident Attendants and a Manager of Residence Life). There are also two dual bedroom rooms for students with disabilities. During the summer, this residence becomes a summer accommodation facility and hotel, although a few students remain in the building for the summer semester. =Orillia= The Orillia Campus was established in 1969. On- site facilities include a 150-seat theatre, fitness centre and weight room. Over 1,600 students pursue studies at the campus. Many but not all programs at the Orillia Campus focus on community safety and human services fields. Other programs include Veterinary Assistant and Veterinary Technician, plus numerous graduate certificate programs and part-time offerings. The campus has an on- site residence housing 192 students in three 4-storey buildings. Residence suites accommodate four students with each student having a private bedroom. =Owen Sound= The Owen Sound Campus has over 1,000 full-time students and offers a wide variety of programs, from skilled trades, to early childhood education, to practical nursing. The campus has an on-site residence that houses 61 students in townhouse-style buildings. Most residence suites accommodate four students with each student having a private bedroom. Among the most notable features of the campus are its marine training facilities. The Algoma Central Corporation Marine Emergency Duties (MED) Centre, which opened in October 2016 is a $7.5 million, 13,600-square-foot facility and a key part of the college's Marine Studies programs. The centre is used extensively by students enrolled in Georgian's postsecondary marine programs as well as by working mariners who require certification or refresher training. MED training is mandatory for anyone who works on a ship in Canada. After several years without a marine emergency duties training facility in Ontario, mariners no longer need to travel to Canada's east or west coasts to obtain this certification. Life-saving training includes firefighting, survival craft, life raft and immersion suit training, as well as first aid.

The outer shell is solid mozzarella, while the inside contains stracciatella and cream, giving it an unusual, soft texture. It is typical of Apulia. History Burrata is a typical product of Murgia in the south of Italy. It is produced from cow's milk, rennet, and cream. Burrata may have origins dating back to about 1900 on the Bianchini farm in the city of Andria within Murgia, an area in the Apulian region. More recent records have shown that Lorenzo Bianchini of the Piana Padura farm first developed the product in 1956. In the 1950s, it became more widely available after some local cheese factories began producing it and it can be a useful way of using up the ritagli (\\"scraps\\" or \\"rags\\") of mozzarella. In November 2016 \\"Burrata di Andria\\" became a Protected geographical indication (PGI) product. Established as an artisanal cheese, burrata maintained its premium-product status even after it began to be made commercially in factories throughout Apulia. Burrata is also produced in the United States, particularly in artisanal cheese shops in cities on the East Coast with historically large populations of Italian Americans. Nevertheless, for the original \\"Burrata di Andria\\" (PGI) all operations from the processing of the raw materials up to the production of the finished product must take place in the defined geographical area of the Region of Apulia. Production Burrata cheese on a salad Burrata starts out much like mozzarella and many other cheeses, with rennet used to curdle the warm milk. But then, unlike other cheeses, fresh mozzarella curds are plunged into hot whey or lightly salted water, kneaded, and pulled to develop the familiar stretchy strings (pasta filata), then shaped in whatever form is desired. When making burrata, the still-hot cheese is formed into a pouch, which is then filled with scraps of leftover mozzarella and topped off with fresh cream before closing. The finished burrata is traditionally wrapped in the leaves of asphodel, tied to form a little brioche-like topknot, and moistened with a little whey. The asphodel leaves should still be green when the cheese is served to indicate the cheese's freshness. More recently, the cheese is often sold in a plastic bag or container. Serving suggestions When the burrata is sliced open, a spurt of thickened cream flows out. The cheese has a rich, buttery flavor and retains its fresh milkiness. It is best when eaten within 24 hours and is considered past its prime after 48 hours. Thanks to its flavor and differing textures inside and outside, it goes well with salad, prosciutto crudo, crusty bread, fresh tomatoes with olive oil, cracked black pepper, or pasta.

It was written for the 1911 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine and stage designs and costumes by Alexandre Benois, who assisted Stravinsky with the libretto. The ballet premiered at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet on 13 June 1911 with Vaslav Nijinsky as Petrushka, Tamara Karsavina as the lead ballerina, Alexander Orlov as the Moor, and Enrico Cecchetti the charlatan. Petrushka tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets. The three are brought to life by the Charlatan during the 1830 Shrovetide Fair (Maslenitsa) in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Petrushka loves the Ballerina, but she rejects him. She prefers the Moor. Petrushka is angry and hurt, and challenges the Moor. The Moor kills him with his scimitar. Petrushka's ghost rises above the puppet theatre as night falls. He shakes his fist at the Charlatan, then collapses in a second death. Petrushka brings music, dance, and design together in a unified whole. It is one of the most popular of the Ballets Russes productions. It is usually performed today using the original designs and choreography. Grace Robert wrote in 1946, \\"Although more than thirty years have elapsed since Petrushka was first performed, its position as one of the greatest ballets remains unassailed. Its perfect fusion of music, choreography, and d√©cor and its themethe timeless tragedy of the human spiritunite to make its appeal universal\\". Russian puppets Petrushka performance in a Russian village, 1908 Petrushka is a puppet. He is a character known across Europe under different names: Punch in England, Polichinelle in France, Pulcinella in Italy, Kasperle in Germany, and Petrushka in Russia. Whatever his name, he is a trickster, a rebel, and a wife beater. He enforces moral justice with a slap stick, speaks in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, and argues with the devil. His plays were formulaic and subversive. They repeated key scenes from one play to another. The plays usually ended with a dog, a policeman, or the devil dragging him away. Empress Anna Ivanovna brought marionettes to Russia in the 18th century. These puppets were an amusement for the aristocracy. Rod puppets were an Asian import. They performed religious plays, mostly at Christmas. Petrushka, however, was a hand puppet. He was loved by the common people. He performed in street theatres and other open air venues in small portable booths or behind screens that could be easily assembled and just as easily disassembled. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet authorities forced Petrushka indoors. They wanted to be better able to monitor his subversiveness. Composition Igor Stravinsky with Vaslav Nijinsky in costume for Petrushka. The gestation of Petrushka was not a straightforward matter. While completing The Firebird during the spring of 1910, Stravinsky had a \\"vision\\" of a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of The Rite of Spring.Stravinsky 47. Immediately following the stunning success of The Firebird in June 1910, Diaghilev approached Stravinsky about a new ballet; the composer proposed the Rite theme. Diaghilev accepted in principle and suggested that the premiere might take place during the Paris season of the Ballets Russes during the spring of 1912. At the end of September 1910, Diaghilev went to visit Stravinsky in Clarens, Switzerland, where he was living at the time. Expecting to discuss the new ballet, Diaghilev was astonished to find Stravinsky hard at work on a totally different project. Stravinsky, it seems, had had another vision: \\"I saw a man in evening dress, with long hair, the musician or poet of the romantic tradition. He placed several heteroclite objects on the keyboard and rolled them up and down. At this the orchestra exploded with the most vehement protestations ‚Äì hammer blows, in fact ‚Ä¶\\"Quoted in Later, Stravinsky wrote: \\"[i]n composing the music, I had in my mind a distinct picture of a puppet, suddenly endowed with life, exasperating the patience of the orchestra with diabolical cascades of arpeggios. The orchestra in turn retaliates with menacing trumpet blasts.\\" Although Stravinsky had conceived the music as a pure concert work‚Äîa Konzertst√ºck, Diaghilev immediately realized its theatrical potential. The notion of a puppet put Diaghilev in mind of Petrushka, the Russian version of Punch and Judy puppetry that had formed a traditional part of the pre-Lenten Carnival festivities in 1830s St. Petersburg. Stravinsky composed the music during the winter of 1910‚Äì11 for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. It was premi√®red in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet on 13 June 1911 under conductor Pierre Monteux, with choreography by Michel Fokine and sets by Alexandre Benois. The title role was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky. The work is characterized by the so- called Petrushka chord (consisting of C major and F major triads played together), a bitonality device heralding the appearance of the main character. Instrumentation =1911 original version= The original 1911 version of Petrushka is scored for the following orchestra. ;Woodwinds: :4 flutes (3rd and 4th doubling piccolo) :4 oboes (4th doubling cor anglais) :4 clarinets in B, (4th doubling bass clarinet in B) :4 bassoons (4th doubling contrabassoon) ;Brass: :4 horns in F :2 trumpets in B (doubling piccolo trumpet) :2 cornets in B and A :3 trombones :1 tuba ;Percussion: :Timpani :Bass drum :Cymbals :2 snare drums (one offstage) :Tambourine (tambour de basque) :Tenor drum (tambourin) (offstage) :Triangle :Tamtam :Glockenspiel :Xylophone :Piano :Celesta (2- and 4-hand) :2 harps ;Strings =1947 revised version= Stravinsky's 1946 scoring is for a smaller orchestra: ;Woodwinds: :3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo) :2 oboes :1 cor anglais :3 clarinets in B (3rd doubling bass clarinet in B) :2 bassoons :1 contrabassoon ;Brass section: :4 horns in F :3 trumpets in B and C :3 trombones :1 tuba ;Percussion: :Timpani :Bass drum :Cymbals :Snare drum :Tambourine :Triangle :Tamtam :Xylophone :Piano :Celesta :Harp ;Strings: Compared to the 1911 version, the 1946 version (given in 1947) requires 1 less flute; 2 fewer oboes, but a dedicated cor anglais player instead of one doubled by the fourth oboe; 1 less clarinet; 2 fewer bassoons, but a dedicated contrabassoon; neither of the 2 cornets, but an additional trumpet; 1 less snare drum and no tenor drum, thus removing the offstage instruments; no glockenspiel; and 1 less harp. Libretto and story The Shrovetide Fair by Benois While the original idea was Stravinsky's, Alexandre Benois provided the ethnographic details of the Shrovetide Fair and the traditions of the Russian puppet theater. And although Petrushka is frequently cited as an example of the complete integration of libretto, music, choreography, and scenic design, Stravinsky had composed significant portions of the music (chiefly the Second Tableau) before Benois became involved with the project. = First Tableau: The Shrovetide Fair = Petrushka begins with a festive orchestral introduction based, in part, on historical Russian street-hawkers' cries.. The curtain rises to reveal St. Petersburg's Admiralty Square during the 1830s. The stage set (also by Benois) depicts several hucksters' booths, a ferris-wheel, a carousel, and (upstage center) a puppet theater. A crowd has gathered for the Shrovetide Fair (known as Maslenitsa), the carnival (analogous to Mardi Gras) preceding Lent. In Fokine's original choreography, a group of Drunken Revelers emerges from the crowd, dancing to Stravinsky's adaptation of the folk-tune \\"Song of the Volochobniki\\" (\\"Dalalin' Dalalin'\\" from Rimsky-Korsakov Op. 24 No. 47). : relative { key f major time 2/4 set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t tempo 4 = 128 {g4 g4  g4 c4  bes4 a8 g8  f4 a4  g4 c4  bes4 a8 g8  f4 a4  g4 g4  a4 g8 f8  time 3/4 g4 f4 a4  time 2/4 g8 f8 g4  g4} } Suddenly, the festive music is interrupted by strident brass announcing the appearance of the Master of Ceremonies on the balcony of his booth. The equivalent of a carnival \\"barker\\", he boasts of the attractions to be seen within. The squeaks of a street-organ are heard (clarinets and flutes) as an Organ-Grinder and Dancing Girl emerge from the crowd, which at first pays little attention as the barker continues to shout. The Dancer moves downstage and begins to dance to another Russian folk-song, \\"Toward Evening, in Rainy Autumn\\", while playing the triangle. At the other end of the stage, a second Dancing Girl appears, accompanied by a music box (suggested in the orchestra by the celesta). The two Dancing Girls compete for the crowd's attention to the strains of a ribald French music-hall song about a woman with a wooden leg: \\"Une Jambe de bois\\". Both tunes are repeated. : relative { time 2/4 partial 4 {g8. (f16  e8) e8 e8 e8 e4 c8 (d8  e8 d8 c8 e8 d4) f8.

The street-hawkers' cries of the very opening are heard once more. Suddenly, two drummers summon the crowd to the puppet theater with deafening drumrolls. The Magician (sometimes called the \\"Charlatan\\") appears to mystical groans from the bassoon and contrabassoon. When he has everyone's attention, he produces a flute and begins to play a long, improvisatory melody. The curtain of the puppet theater rises to reveal three puppets hanging on the wall: the Moor, the Ballerina, and Petrushka. When the Magician touches them with his flute (to chirps in the orchestra), they seem to awaken. The astonished crowd watches as, with a wave of the Magician's hand, the three puppets begin a vigorous Russian Dance (based on two more Russian folk-tunes: \\"A Linden Tree Is in the Field\\" and \\"Song for St. John's Eve\\"). : relative c { key c major time 2/4 { b16^markup \\"First theme of Russian Dance\\" c16 d8 e16 d16 c16 b16  a8 a8 b4  b16 c16 d16 e16 d8 c16 b16  a8 a8 b4  b16 c16 d8 e16 d16 c16 b16  a8 a8 b8 b8  b16 c16 d16 e16 d16 c16 b16 a16  g8 f8 e4 } } : relative c { key a major time 2/4 { e8-.^markup \\"Song for St. John's Eve\\" a8-. gis16 (fis16 b8) a8 [(b8 a8 gis8)]  b4-> (gis8) cis8  b8 (gis16 fis16 e8) r8} } In Fokine's masterly choreography, they first begin to move their feet (while still hanging on the wall), then burst forth from the puppet theater into the midst of the crowd. The Moor (resplendent in turban and exaggerated pantaloons) is swashbuckling. The Ballerina dances perpetually en pointe. Petrushka, on the other hand, is wooden and awkward. It becomes apparent Petrushka loves the Ballerina; but she has eyes only for the Moor. The Magician calls the dance to a halt; the curtain falls rapidly. Petrushka's Room by Alexandre Benois. = Second Tableau: Petrushka's Room = Although Petrushka's room is inside the puppet theater, the Benois design is fantastical, portraying the night sky with stars and a half-moon; abstract icebergs (or snow-capped mountains), and a prominent portrait of the Magician. Drumrolls announce the beginning of the Second Tableau. Without an Introduction, the music begins menacingly. \\"A foot kicks him onstage; Petrushka falls...\\" As Petrushka gradually pulls himself together, we hear a strange arpeggio in the clarinets: this is the famous \\"Petrushka chord\\" (consisting of juxtaposed triads of C major and F major). Petrushka gets to his feet (although shakily) to the accompaniment of waves of arpeggios from the piano (revealing the music's origins in Stravinsky's Konzertst√ºck). The \\"Petrushka Chord\\" returns, now violently scored for trumpets, marked in the score \\"Petrushka's Curses\\", directed at the portrait of the Magician. The music turns lyrical as Petrushka falls to his knees and mimes (in turn) his self-pity, love for the Ballerina, and hatred of the Magician. The Ballerina (still en pointe) sneaks into Petrushka's room, at first unnoticed. As soon as Petrushka sees her, he begins a manic, athletic display of leaps and frantic gestures (although he was barely able to stand before she arrived). Frightened by his exuberance, the Ballerina flees. Petrushka falls to the floor to the mocking of the clarinets. Another passage of arpeggios for piano grows into a second round of curses directed at the Magician, again represented musically by the \\"Petrushka Chord\\", this time scored for full orchestra. For just a moment, Petrushka peers out of his room at the crowd assembled in Admiralty Square (Stravinsky provides a brief reference to the \\"crowd music\\" of the First Tableau). Then, Petrushka collapses as we hear a taunting reprise of the clarinets playing the \\"Petrushka Chord\\", followed by an odd trumpet call signalling \\"blackout, curtain.\\" The Moor's Room by Benois = Third Tableau: The Moor's Room = As before, drumrolls link the Third Tableau to its predecessor (in the 1911 score, Stravinsky directs that this drumroll should be omitted in concert performance). In sharp contrast to the darkness of Petrushka's Room, the brilliant colors of the Benois design for the Moor's Room evoke a romanticized desert: palm trees, exotic flowers, sand. In Fokine's choreography, the Moor reclines on a divan playing with a coconut. He then jumps to his feet and attempts to cut it with his scimitar. When he fails he believes that the coconut must be a god and proceeds to pray to it. The Charlatan places the Ballerina in the Moor's room. The Ballerina is attracted to the Moor's handsome appearance. She plays a saucy tune on a toy trumpet (represented by a cornet in the original 1911 orchestration) and then dances with the Moor in a waltz (the themes taken from Joseph Lanner's Op. 165 No. 1 and Op. 200 No. 1).Peyser, To Boulez and Beyond, p. 75 Petrushka finally breaks free from his cell; he interrupts the seduction of the Ballerina. Petrushka attacks the Moor but soon realizes he is too small and weak. The Moor beats Petrushka. The ballerina faints. The clown-puppet flees for his life, with the Moor chasing him, and escapes from the room. = Fourth Tableau: The Shrovetide Fair (Toward Evening) = The fourth and final scene returns to the carnival. Some time has passed; it is now early evening. The orchestra introduces a chain of colourful dances as a series of apparently unrelated characters come and go about the stage as snow begins to fall. The first and most prominent is the Wet-Nurses' Dance, performed to the tune of the folk song \\"Down the Petersky Road\\". Then comes a peasant with his dancing bear, followed in turn by a group of a gypsies, coachmen and grooms and masqueraders. As the merrymaking reaches its peak, a cry is heard from the puppet-theater. Petrushka suddenly runs across the scene, followed by the Moor in hot pursuit brandishing his sword, and the terrified Ballerina chasing after the Moor, fearful of what he might do. The crowd is horrified when the Moor catches up with Petrushka and slays him with a single stroke of his blade. The police question the Charlatan. The Charlatan seeks to restore calm by holding the \\"corpse\\" above his head and shaking it to remind everyone that Petrushka is but a puppet. As night falls and the crowd disperses, the Charlatan leaves, carrying Petrushka's limp body. All of a sudden, Petrushka's ghost appears on the roof of the little theatre, his cry now in the form of angry defiance. Petrushka's spirit thumbs its nose at his tormentor from beyond the wood and straw of his carcass. Now completely alone, the Charlatan is terrified to see the leering ghost of Petrushka. He runs away while allowing himself a single frightened glance over his shoulder. The scene is hushed, leaving the audience to wonder who is \\"real\\" and who is not. Structure The work is divided into four tableaux (scenes). The score further indicates the following episodes: :First Tableau: The Shrovetide Fair #[Introduction] #A group of Drunken Revelers passes, dancing #The Master of Ceremonies entertains the Crowd from his booth above #An Organ-Grinder appears in the Crowd with a [woman] Dancer #The Organ-Grinder begins to play #The Dancer dances, beating time on the triangle #At the other end of the stage a Music Box plays, another [woman] Dancer dancing around it. #The first Dancer plays the triangle again #The Organ and Music Box stop playing; the Master of Ceremonies resumes his pitch #The Merry Group returns #Two Drummers, stepping up in front of the Little Theater, attract the attention of the Crowd by their drumrolls #At the front of [i.e. from inside] the Little Theater appears the Old Magician. #The Magic Trick #Russian Dance :Second Tableau: Petrushka's Room #As the Curtain rises, the door to Petrushka's room opens suddenly; a foot kicks him onstage; Petrushka falls and the door closes again behind him #Petrushka's curses #The Ballerina enters #The Ballerina leaves #Petrushka's despair #Darkness.

The Ballerina faints. #The Moor throws Petrushka Out. Darkness. Curtain. :Fourth Tableau: The Shrovetide Fair (Toward Evening) #[Introduction] #The Wet-Nurses' Dance #A Peasant enters with a Bear. Everyone scatters. #The Peasant plays the pipe. The Bear walks on his hind feet. #The Peasant and the Bear leave. #A Reveling Merchant and two Gypsy Women Enter. He irresponsibly amuses himself by throwing bank notes to the Crowd. #The Gypsy Women dance. The Merchant plays the accordion. #The Merchant and the Gypsies leave #Dance of the Coachmen and the Grooms #The Mummers #The dances break off. Petrushka dashes from the Little Theater, pursued by the Moor, whom the Ballerina tries to restrain. #The furious Moor seizes him and strikes him with his saber. #Petrushka falls, his head broken #A crowd forms around Petrushka #He dies, still moaning. #A Policeman is sent to look for the Magician #The Magician arrives #He picks up Petrushka's corpse, shaking it. #The Crowd disperses. #The Magician remains alone on stage. He drags Petrushka's corpse toward the Little Theater. #Above the Little Theater appears the Ghost of Petrushka, menacing, thumbing his nose at the Magician. #The terrified Magician lets the Puppet-Petrushka drop from his hands, and exits quickly, casting frightened glances over his shoulder. #Curtain Other versions During rehearsals for the 1911 premiere, Stravinsky and other pianists including Russian composer Nikolai Tcherepnin used a piano four-hand version of the score. This has never been published, although Paul Jacobs and Ursula Oppens, among other pianists, have played it in concert. In 1921, Stravinsky created a virtuosic and celebrated piano arrangement for Arthur Rubinstein, Trois mouvements de Petrouchka, which the composer admitted he could not play himself, for want of adequate left-hand technique. Herbert Stothart, who composed the score for The Wizard of Oz, was visited by Stravinsky at MGM in 1936. Stravinsky gifted Stothart a personal, signed copy of Petrushka. As the main characters in the film run through the Poppy Field, the opening to the fourth tableau can be heard briefly. In 1946, he thinned the ballet's scoring, in part because the original was not covered everywhere by copyright. The rapid continuous timpani and snare-drum notes that link each scene, optional in 1911, are compulsory in this version, which was published in 1947. The Ballerina's tune is assigned to a trumpet in 1946 in place of a cornet, and the 1946 version provides an optional (fortississimo) near the piano conclusion. Stravinsky also removed some difficult metric modulations in the First Tableau. Separately Stravinsky created a suite for concert performance, an almost complete version of the ballet but cutting the last three sections. In 1956, an animated version of the ballet appeared as part of NBC's Sol Hurok Music Hour. It was personally conducted by Stravinsky himself and was the first such collaboration. Directed by animator John David Wilson with Fine Arts Films, it has been noted as the first animated special ever to air on television. In 1988, Maddalena Fagandini directed a version of Petrushka along with The Sleeping Beauty (Tchaikovsky), The Nutcracker (and the Mouse King) (Tchaikovsky) and Copp√©lia (Delibes) in the BBC puppet film Musical Tales which was released in VHS. Basil Twist debuted his puppetry version of Petrushka at Lincoln Center in 2001; it was performed as well at New York City Center's 2009 Fall for Dance Festival. A full transcription of the 1911 version for symphonic wind ensemble in the original key was made by Don Patterson. Themes from Petrushka are played on banjo in the track \\"Russian Folk Themes and Yodel\\" on Pete Seeger's album Goofing-Off Suite, released in 1955 on Folkways Records.

It is the only privately managed prison in South Australia. It is currently managed and operated by G4S Custodial Services Pty Ltd. Prison life The prison accommodates medium and low security male sentenced and remand prisoners. Short-term high security male and female prisoners can also be accommodated when required. Accommodation includes: a traditional cell block arrangement, shared living cottages, semi-independent living cottages, an induction area that houses new prisoners, and a small allocation of high-security cells. Mount Gambier Prison provides a full range of prisoner services, including all medical, education, facilities management, equipment and grounds preventative maintenance services ‚Äòin house‚Äô, using locally employed staff and sub-contractors. Consistent with other prisons in South Australia, prisoners are placed on incentive-based regimes that provide varying levels of privileges based on behaviour. Prisoners are engaged in a range of work programs including grounds and building maintenance, cleaning, laundry and kitchen work. The prison also has a large timber furniture manufacturing workshop that produces bedroom and living room furniture for dispatch directly to retail outlets in South Australia. Education and program activities focus on numeracy and literacy skills and cognitive skills programs are aimed at high risk offenders. In 1998, prisoners under the instructions of a local builder constructed an education centre within the prison. The work was also attached to a vocational course. This resulted in prisoners learning new skills and obtaining TAFE certificates to assist them upon their release. A strong partnership exists between Lifeline South East and the prison. This relationship began in mid-1995 with Lifeline's involvement in suicide awareness training for new prison staff. In 2010, the prisoner listener program, which aims to reduce suicides at the prison, gained a national award. Improvements In March 2009, an expansion of the prison was announced. With a project budget of $22.9m, it will be the first South Australian prison to employ the cheaper and faster modular construction method using shipping containers. The cell block is constructed as a single storey facility designed around two wings of 54 beds (total of 108 beds) with a central officers station to supervise both wings. Each wing has a central external exercise yard. A new kitchen will also be built and the prison perimeter will be extended. * During 2003-2004, work was conducted in the cells to eliminate hanging points and the fire safety systems in the cell block, the cottages and the operations building were upgraded. *In 2005, a new $950,000 state-of-the art Control Room was officially commissioned. *In 2007, to address pressure on the South Australian Custodial Correctional system, the prisons capacity increased from 110 to 139 beds. In June 2012, the capacity of the prison was 172. * The 2017 state budget included provision to spen on adding 160 beds to Mount Gambier Prison Incidents In April 2001, a single prisoner became the first to escape the facility by climbing two razor-wire-topped fences. This is the only escape from within the confines of the prison as of June 2012. In July 2004, the South Australian Coroner was critical of cell design, Group 4 and Department of Correctional Services staff following the death of a prisoner. In March 2009, Chief executive of the Department of Correctional Services Peter Severin said that since the Mount Gambier Prison was opened in [1995], it has been a stable facility with \\"very few\\" incidents.

Ardent Records/Ardent Music is the in-house label.  History  Ardent Studios was founded by John Fry and was initially a studio in his family's garage, where he recorded his first Ardent Records 45s. In 1966 the operation moved into a new store building on Memphis' National Street, which was shared with a bookshop. The original equipment came from the garage operation: Altec tube console, Ampex 2-track, Pultec EQ and Neumann mics-some of which are still in use today. Tom Dowd was consulting with Auditronics on an early multitrack console for nearby Stax Records, and Fry ordered the same input modules for his second board. Next came a Scully 4-track, and the first EMT plate reverbs in the area. Ardent became home to young producers and engineers such as Jim Dickinson, Terry Manning, Joe Hardy, John Hampton, Paul Ebersold, and later Skidd Mills, Jeff Powell, Brad Blackwood, Pete Mathews, and Jason Latshaw. In 1971, Ardent Studios moved to its present location on Madison Avenue, followed by the acquisition of 24-track recorders, bigger consoles and more gear. Ardent came to have three studios equipped, all with large format Neve and SSL desks alongside Pro Tools rigs. It is managed by Jody Stephens (also drummer for Big Star, an early Ardent group whose first two albums appeared on Ardent Records label in the early 1970s). All three Big Star albums were named in Rolling Stone's Top 500 albums of all time, and ‚ÄúIn The Street,‚Äù from their first album, became the theme for ‚ÄúThat 70s Show.‚Äù Early on, the studio recorded Sam & Dave, Led Zeppelin, Isaac Hayes, Leon Russell and the Staples Singers, and in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s recorded James Taylor, ZZ Top, R.E.M., George Thorogood, The Allman Brothers, Bob Dylan, Joe Walsh, and Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan. In the 2000s younger artists such as The White Stripes, 3 Doors Down, Cat Power, North Mississippi Allstars, The Raconteurs, Low Cut Connie and Guy Sebastian have recorded at Ardent, and the soundtracks for Hustle and Flow and Black Snake Moan were produced at Ardent as well. To date, Ardent has recorded over 70 gold and platinum albums and singles.

Located at 421 SW 6th Avenue between Washington and Stark Streets, it was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi and built between 1944 and 1948. The building was originally known as the Equitable Building and is noted as one of the first glass box towers ever built, pioneering many modern features and predating the more famous Lever House in Manhattan. History 1940s postcard of the building Construction on the building began in 1944, with it opening in 1948 as the Equitable Building. The building, which was built as the headquarters in Portland of the Equitable Savings and Loan Association, was originally intended to be 12 stories high but was later expanded to 14. It was the first tower to be sheathed in aluminum, the first to use double-glazed window panels, and was the first to be completely sealed and fully air-conditioned. In 1965, the building was renamed as the Commonwealth Building when the Equitable Center (now Unitus Plaza) opened, which was also designed by Pietro Belluschi. The Commonwealth Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (as the Equitable Building) in 1976. In 1980, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) designated the Commonwealth Building as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.Equitable Building Heat Pump (1948) from asme.org In 1982, the building was the recipient of the Twenty-five Year Award, of the American Institute of Architects. In 1993, Weston Investment Co. LLC bought the building for $1.9 million. Unico Properties and Cigna Realty Investors bought the building in 2007 from Weston for $27 million, and spent $7 million more on renovations to the structure. The building was sold again by Unico in 2013 for $41 million when Unico bought out Cigna. Unico sold the tower to KBS in 2016 for $69 million. Features Designed by noted Oregon architect Pietro Belluschi, the tower is of the International Style. The 14-story, -tall glass box tower is constructed of sea-green glass and is sheathed in aluminum. Designations and awards The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is also designated as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the ASME. The ASME History & Heritage Committee bestowed this landmark status for the specific feature: the first large commercial building in the United States to pioneer the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling.

One of the four major zaibatsu of Imperial Japan, it was founded by the entrepreneur Yasuda Zenjir≈ç. It was dissolved at the end of World War II. Origins Yasuda Zenjir≈ç moved to Edo at the age of 17 and began working in a money changing house. In 1863, he started providing tax-farming services, and greatly magnified his wealth by buying up depreciated Meiji paper money that the government subsequently exchanged for gold. He quickly began to amass newly available capital, establishing the Third National Bank in 1876 and forming the Yasuda Bank (later known as the Fuji Bank) in 1880, the center of the Yasuda zaibatsu. Yasuda consolidated his empire in banking and finance, specializing in backing small and medium-sized traders and industrialists. In 1880, Yasuda founded the Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Company (now Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance). In 1893, the Yasuda zaibatsu absorbed the Tokyo Fire Insurance Company, later renamed the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company. 20th century The Yasuda focus on banking was narrowed by the merger of eleven Yasuda-controlled banks into the Yasuda Bank in 1913. The post-merger bank was by far the largest of all the zaibatsu banks. Zenjir≈ç Yasuda was assassinated in 1921 when he refused to make a financial donation to an ultra- nationalist. Zenjir≈ç's son, Zennosuke Yasuda, assumed leadership of the zaibatsu. By 1928, the Yasuda zaibatsu was ranked behind only the Mitsui and Mitsubishi groups in total capital. In that year, the Yasuda zaibatsu encompassed 66 companies and reported total capital of ¬•308 million. During World War II, the Japanese government began forcing consolidation of major financial institutions. In January 1942, Hajime Yasuda, the head of the conglomerate, announced that all Yasuda family members would withdraw from related and subsidiary companies, assuming new leadership positions as board members over all zaibatsu concerns. Dissolution Following Japan's defeat in August 1945, Hajime Yasuda and Yasuda executives assumed a leadership role in planning for the dissolution of their own group. The \\"Yasuda plan\\" was submitted in October 1945 and stipulated that the Yasuda zaibatsu would be dissolved and that Yasuda Bank would cease to control Yasuda subsidiaries. In addition, family members and executives appointed by them would resign from all Yasuda companies. The Yasuda Plan, with some revisions, was accepted by the U.S. government in November of that year.Sumiya, Mikio. (2000). A History of Japanese Trade and Industry Policy, p. 157. Present day After the restoration of the sovereignty of Japan, the Yasuda family was lifted from employment restrictions at Yasuda affiliates and formed the Fuyo Group with Fuji Bank, the successor to Yasuda Bank, at the core. Although the Yasuda Zaibatsu was revived as a corporate group as a keiretsu, it was no longer controlled by Yasuda family management.Fuyo Group, the Hibiscus Keiretsu Artist Yoko Ono, the wife of musician John Lennon, is a daughter of the Yasuda clan.Norman, Philip (2009).

The Cooperative Research Centres Programme was established in 1990 to enhance Australia's industrial, commercial and economic growth through the development of sustained, user-driven, cooperative public-private research centres that achieve high levels of outcomes in adoption and commercialisation. The program emphasises the importance of collaborative arrangements to maximise the benefits of research through an enhanced process of utilisation, commercialisation and technology transfer. It also has a strong education component with a focus on producing graduates with skills relevant to industry needs. Most CRCs offer scholarships for postgraduate students. The CRC Programme is administered by the Commonwealth Department of Industry and Science. Reviews of the Cooperative Research Programme have been regularly undertaken. In 2012, an independent impact study found CRCs generated a net economic benefit of $7.5 billion from 1991 to 2017. This equates to an annual contribution of $278 million, or around 0.03 percentage points to GDP. The Cooperative Research Centre Association (CRCA), established on 1 December 1994, to promote the CRC program while also acting a conduit for information sharing and learning between CRCs. Over time the role has evolved to the extent that today the CRCA is also recognised as the principal non-Government advocate of the CRC Program. History of the CRC program Since the commencement of the CRC Programme in 1991 there have been 14 selection rounds. Selection rounds were conducted in March 1991, December 1991, December 1992, December 1994, and then at regular two year intervals: 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006. Following the review of the Programme in 2008, the 11th and 12th Selection rounds were both held in 2009. Selection rounds are now annual. A number of websites of previously funded CRCs are archived in perpetuity on the National Library of Australia's Trove online library database aggregator. CRC education success stories *The CRC program is estimated to have supported 4,400 doctorate and master's degrees by research. *The value of CRC education outcomes is estimated to be a total of $163 million. *The Poultry CRC produced an information sharing service which the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization praised for increasing interest in poultry production. *The CRC for Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management produced the first written history of resource management by the Yalanji people, written in both English and Yalanji language. *The Molecular Plant Breeding CRC, in conjunction with the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics developed an education program about the role of gene technology in agriculture.

Through his noble mother, he was a descendant of Mikhail Lermontov. In 1912, the family moved to Arzamas where in 1914 Arkady enrolled in a local secondary school. In 1917, as an ardent 13-year-old Bolshevik follower, Gaidar started to distribute leaflets and patrol the streets. During one such mission, he received his first wound, a stab in the chest.Kassil, Lev. Biography. Works by Arkady Gaidar in 4 volumes. Detskaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1964. Vol. 1. Pp. 38.

In December 1919, injured and shell-shocked, he was demobilised, but in March 1920 returned to the Red Army, to the Caucasian Front's 9th Army, 37th Kuban Division, as a company commander again. In summer 1920, Gaidar took part in operations against the units of generals Geyman and Zhitikov. In 1921, Gaidar participated in the suppression of several anti- communist uprisings, among them Antonovshchina. In 1922, he was moved to the Mongolian border (where the Red Army was fighting White Army units led by colonels Oliferov and Solovyov), but later that year he was hospitalised with traumatic neuroses. He retired from the army in 1924 due to a contusion.Arkady Gaidar. Biography. Timeline. Works by Arkady Gaidar in 4 volumes. Detskaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1964. Vol. 1. Pp. 38. As the Great Patriotic War broke out, Gaidar was sent to the front as a special correspondent for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. In the fall of 1941, Gaidar and other soldiers were surrounded by German troops. He joined the partisans and became a machine gunner. On 26 October, Gaidar was killed in combat near the village of Lyuplyava. He was buried in the town of Kaniv. Literary work In 1925, Gaidar's debut novel In the Days of Defeats and Victories was published, followed by Life For Nothing and The Mystery of a Mountain, a sci-fi novel and, most notably, R.V.S. (1925) which formed a blueprint for his career as a children's writer, telling stories of front-line camaraderie and the romanticism of the revolutionary struggle. In 1927, Gaidar moved to Moscow. A year later, he went to Archangelsk to work for a local newspaper, Pravda Severa. Back in Moscow, in 1930, he published the novel School (originally titled \\"The Plain Biography\\"). In the early 1930s, several articles on Gaidar's works appeared in the Soviet press, Konstantin Fedin being his major supporter and mentor. In 1939, Gaidar was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour. Short stories \\"The Military Secret\\" (1935), \\"The Blue Cup\\" (1936) and the novel Blue Stars (1939) were followed by his most famous work, Timur and His Squad (1940), its hero named after, and partially based on the character of, the author's son. A captivating account of an altruistic pioneer youth gave birth to the mass Timur movement among Young Pioneers and other children's organisations all over the Soviet Union. A number of films were made based on his stories.

Recognition and remembrance Gaidar was awarded two orders and several medals. A monument honouring him was erected in Kaniv in 1953. Three biographical movies about Arkady Gaidar were released in the USSR: Serebryanye truby (Russian: Silver Trumpets) (1970), Konets imperatora taygi (Russian: The Death of the Taiga Emperor) (1978), and Ostayus s vami (Russian: I'll Stay with You) (1981). The latter was a story of Arkady Gaidar's last days. Pseudonym Arkady's son, Timur Gaidar published two versions of the pseudonym's origin:\\"–ì–æ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤ –ê—Ä–∫–∞–¥–∏–π –∏–∑ –ê—Ä–∑–∞–º–∞—Å–∞\\", by Timur Gaidar #This an abbreviation of French \\"Golikov Arkady d ' Arsamas\\", which means \\"Golikov, Arkady from Arzamas\\". # Arkady took the name Gaidar from a Khakas language word meaning going first, the leader. Another version is that the name comes from the Khakas word for \\"Where is?\\" which is the question Gaidar would shout as he and his unit went from village to village in the Yenisei River region tracking down (and eventually killing) the Cossack hetman he was pursuing during the Civil War.

It was popular amongst the Pashtun tribesmen , who deposed king Shah Shuja. and was used mostly in the Anglo Afghan wars by the Pashtuns against invading British soldiers. Features Lithograph dated during the First Anglo-Afghan War of a Pashtun tribesmen (from the Ghizai tribe) and his jezail. Jezails were generally handmade weapons, and consequently they widely varied in their construction. Jezails were seen as very personal weapons, and unlike the typical military weapons of the time which were very plain and utilitarian, jezails tended to be well crafted and were usually intricately decorated. Jezails tended to have very long barrels. Such lengths were never common in European rifles (with the exception of the Spanish \\"espingarda\\" (es) circa 15th century), but were more common in American rifles, such as the Kentucky Rifle. The American rifles were used for hunting, and tended to be of a smaller caliber (.35 to .45 or so being typical). Jezails were usually designed for warfare, and therefore tended to be of larger calibers than the American rifles, with .50 to .75 caliber and larger being common. Larger calibers were possible because the long length of the typical jezail meant that it was heavier than typical muskets of the time. Jezails typically weighed around 12 to 14 pounds, compared to 9 to 10 pounds for a typical musket. The heavy weight of the jezail allowed the rifle itself to absorb more energy from the round, imparting less recoil to the weapon's user. Many jezails were smooth bore weapons, but some had their barrels rifled. The rifling, combined with the barrel's long length, made these weapons very accurate for their time. The firing mechanism was typically either a matchlock or a flintlock. Since flintlock mechanisms were complex and difficult to manufacture, many jezails used the lock mechanism from captured or broken Brown Bess muskets. The stocks were handmade and ornately decorated, featuring a distinctive curve which is not seen in the stocks of other muskets. The function of this curve is debated; it may be purely decorative, or it may have allowed the jezail to be tucked under the arm and cradled tightly against the body, as opposed to being held to the shoulder like a typical musket or rifle. The argument against this method of firing is that the flash pan would be dangerously close to the face and the weapon would be harder to aim. It is more likely that the rifle was only tucked under the arm whilst riding a horse or a camel. The curve may also have saved weight; by shaving away some of the heavy wood used for the stock through employment of the new curved shape, whilst maintaining the same structural integrity of the stock it could still be fired from the shoulder safely whilst also being lighter. The weapon was fired by grasping the stock near the trigger, like a pistol, while the curved portion is tucked under the shooter's forearm, allowing the rifle to be fired with one hand while mounted. Jezails were often fired from a forked rest, or a horn or metal bipod. Anglo-Afghan Wars Group of Pashtun Tribesmen (Afridi) fighters in 1878, pictured with their jezails, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. During this period, the jezail was the primary weapon amongst the Pashtuns in and was used with great effect against British troops. British Brown Bess smoothbore muskets were effective at no more than 150 yards, and not accurate beyond 50 yards. Because of their advantage in range, Pashtun marksmen typically used the jezail from the tops of cliffs along valleys and defiles during ambushes. This tactic repeatedly inflicted heavy casualties the British during their doomed 1842 retreat from Kabul to Jalalabad. Despite the advantages over the Brown Bess, British forces were typically able to defeat jezail armed Pashtuns when they fought on relatively flat terrain. In the First Anglo-Afghan War the British established a cantonment outside of Kabul with dirt walls approximately waist high. Surrounding the cantonment were several abandoned forts which, although out of range of British muskets, were close enough for jezail fire. When ghazi and other Pashtuns forces besieged Kabul and the cantonment, they occupied the forts and used them to snipe British forces from a safe range. A description from the British Library dating to the First Anglo-Afghan War: In British literature The jezail is most notable, at least in Western literature, as the weapon which wounded Dr. Watson‚Äîthe fictional biographer of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes‚Äîin the Battle of Maiwand during his military service in Afghanistan. In A Study in Scarlet, Watson mentions being wounded in the shoulder.Doyle, Arthur Conan. A Study in Scarlet, 1887 However, in The Sign of the Four, Watson gives the location of the wound as in his leg.Doyle, Arthur Conan. The Sign of the Four, 1890 In \\"The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\\" Watson refers to the Jezail bullet being \\"in one of my limbs.\\" These discrepancies have caused debate by Sherlock Holmes fans about which of these locations is the \\"correct\\" location of the wound. The jezail is mentioned repeatedly in some of Wilbur Smith's books, most notably \\"Monsoon\\". It was also mentioned in the George MacDonald Fraser adventure Flashman, whose protagonist describes the awful slaughter of British troops retreating from Kabul to Jalalabad by Pashtun jezailchis. It appears in Rudyard Kipling 1886 poem Arithmetic on the Frontier, where the low cost of the weapon is contrasted with the relatively expensive training and education of British officers: :A scrimmage in a Border Station :A canter down some dark defile :Two thousand pounds of education :Drops to a ten-rupee jezail. Another reference to the jezail occurs in Kipling's novel The Man Who Would Be King, where the Kohat Jezail is mentioned in the same paragraph as the more advanced Snider and Martini rifles of the British. P. G. Wodehouse in Jill the Reckless (1920) describes how the character Uncle Chris, in India during his first hill-campaign, would \\"walk up and down in front of his men under a desultory shower of jezail-bullets\\". Contemporary use The jezail no longer sees widespread use in warfare of any nature. Limited numbers were, however, used by Mujahideen rebels during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Derivatives of the jezail, barely recognizable, and usually termed 'country-made weapons', are in use in rural India‚Äîespecially in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

He was the sixth Mayor of Calgary, Alberta. Early Life Reilly was born in 1835 in Napierville, Quebec to immigrant parents from Ireland. In Quebec he became an architect and builder before going to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1882, then to Calgary in 1883. In Calgary he became actively involved with the local community. He played a key part in organizing a citizens group concerned about the location of the railway station that was built in Calgary. While proprietor of the Royal Hotel, he organized the first civic committee meeting on January 4, 1884. This was the first step leading to Calgary's municipal incorporation later that year. Political life Reilly ran for mayor in Calgary's second municipal election in January 1886, and lost the popular vote to incumbent George Murdoch. Stipendiary Magistrate Jeremiah Travis overturned the result of the January 1886 election on weak charges of corruption by Murdoch, and appointed Reilly the Mayor of Calgary. Murdoch would not accept Travis' order and both parties attempted to govern the town, leading to dysfunction and the absence of local government until the federal government reorganized the Northwest Territories governance, suspended Travis and a new election was organized for November 1886. Neither Reilly or Murdoch would contest the November 1886 election. The City of Calgary recognizes Murdoch as the elected mayor in January 1886. Reilly would later be elected Town Councillor in 1890, and subsequently be elected Calgary's sixth mayor in 1891. Reilly served one term as mayor, and was again elected as a councillor in 1892. After serving one term as councillor, Reilly would remain out of municipal politics until second election as mayor in 1898. =Territorial election attempts= Reilly would contest several Northwest Territory general elections, including the 1894, 1898 and 1902 Northwest Territories general election in the constituency of East Calgary. Reilly would never garner more than 22 per cent of the vote, or finish better than third. =Federal election attempt= James Reilly would contest the 1891 Canadian federal election for the Alberta (Provisional District), losing by a considerable margin to Donald Watson Davis. In an advertisement in the February 28, 1891 Edmonton Bulletin, Reilly would explain his platform which was primarily focused on having Alberta become a province in Confederation. Reilly would also support greater trade through railways with the United States, local options for liquor prohibition, greater commercial development in Banff, Alberta, removal of the Sarcee people for urban expansion, and supported the claims of M√©tis people for recognition from the government. While it is noted by historians that Reilly was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, and he was supported in his election by future Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Oliver, Reilly noted in an advertisement in the Edmonton Bulletin that he is \\"a Conservative and supporter of that policy of Sir John A. Macdonald that has built up the financial credit of Canada...\\". Later Life In October 1899, Reilly left Calgary and traveled extensively. He retired in Victoria, British Columbia, where he died on July 9, 1909 from influenza. His death came as a shock to many, as his condition had been seemingly improving. He was later interred in Calgary. After his death, it was said that \\"to write the life of the late James Reilly is to rewrite the history of Calgary.\\" Reilly was married to May Watts.

Young Eric began playing drums from an early age, and was inspired by bands such as Humble Pie, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Beatles and Queen and drummers such as John Bonham, Keith Moon, Cozy Powell, Roger Taylor, Bill Ward, and Buddy Rich. Eric worked at King Musical instruments before becoming a professional drummer. Singer's first professional drumming job was in the Cleveland band Beau Coup. He then became Lita Ford's touring drummer in 1984. In 1985 he joined Black Sabbath, replacing original drummer Bill Ward (actually Vinnie Appice replaced Bill Ward and played on The Mob Rules and Live Evil), who had left the band after the Live Aid reunion. Singer would participate in the recording of the albums Seventh Star and The Eternal Idol. In 1987, he was invited to join Gary Moore to tour in support of his album, Wild Frontier. After the tour, he was invited by his Black Sabbath colleague Ray Gillen to join Badlands. Singer accepted and played on the band's self-titled debut album. Singer left the group in 1989 as he would join Paul Stanley as his touring drummer on his solo tour of the United States and Canada. Singer played with Olivia Newton-John in the music video for \\"Culture Shock\\". He later revealed in an interview that he obtained that gig because he was working for Lita Ford at the time. Kiss Singer's 'The Catman' make-up In December 1991, Singer officially became the drummer for Kiss after the death of Eric Carr. Singer, who had performed with Paul Stanley on his club tour along with Bob Kulick two years earlier, was hired and debuted with the band on the album Revenge, on which he was originally slated to fill in on some tracks while Eric Carr recuperated from heart cancer.Leaf and Sharp, Kiss: Behind The Mask ‚Äì The Official Authorized Biography, pp. 387, 390. Singer played on Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions and toured with Kiss until 1996, when the band reunited with original drummer Peter Criss and guitarist Ace Frehley for the Alive/Worldwide Tour. After five relatively quiet years, during which Singer toured with Queen guitarist Brian May, Singer was asked to rejoin Kiss in 2001 after Criss' departure shortly before the Australian and Japanese leg of Kiss' Farewell tour. Singer debuted in full \\"Catman\\" makeup and costume for the first time on the tour, which caused some controversy as the persona had previously been used only by Criss.Sherman, Black Diamond, p. 161 Singer was replaced again by Criss in late 2002 but returned to the band in early 2004 after Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley opted not to renew Criss' contract. Since then, Singer has been playing drums in Kiss as their permanent drummer. In 2009, Singer, along with lead guitarist Tommy Thayer, played and sang on the Kiss album Sonic Boom, the first studio album to feature the new line-up. It included the track \\"All for the Glory\\" (written by Stanley and Simmons) with vocals by Singer. In October 2012, Kiss released their 20th studio album Monster which includes a track called \\"All for the Love of Rock & Roll\\" sung by Singer (written by Stanley). In a 2008 interview, Peter Criss stated that he thought Singer was a great drummer, despite being upset about Singer using his image. Eric Singer Project, Alice Cooper and other projects When not touring with Kiss, Singer performed with Alice Cooper. Singer had been a member of Cooper's band since the release of the album Brutal Planet in 2000. Singer had already performed with Cooper years earlier, during the tour for the album Trash. Singer has been featured on three Alice Cooper albums to date, namely, Brutal Planet, The Eyes of Alice Cooper, and Along Came a Spider. In 2008, Eric Singer left Cooper's band on Cooper's suggestion that he (Eric) instead focus on his growing commitments with Kiss as well as with the Eric Singer Project (ESP). He has also occasionally performed and recorded with his own ESP, featuring, among others, his former Kiss bandmate Bruce Kulick and former M√∂tley Cr√ºe lead singer John Corabi. Three releases have resulted from this collaboration: the studio album Lost and Spaced (1998), consisting completely of covers from classic rock songs; the live album Live in Japan (2006); and the DVD Live at the Marquee (2006). Singer has also played in the band Avantasia, replacing drummer Alex Holzwarth after a guest performance in the song \\"Into the Unknown\\" from the album The Metal Opera Part II. Two EPs and one full album have been released with Singer's performance on the drums: Lost in Space Part I, Lost in Space Part II, and The Scarecrow, and on several songs from The Wicked Symphony and Angel of Babylon. In 1989, he made a brief appearance in the Wes Craven film Shocker, as a member of a fictional rock band. In 2004 Singer was featured on Italian rock singer Chris Catena's debut album, Freak Out. He recorded drums for two tracks, \\"Sweet Talker\\" (a Whitesnake cover) and \\"The Stronger You Are, The Harder You Fall\\". In 2015 Singer was elected to the jury of watchmaking's highest awards, the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Gen√®ve (GPHG). He is a well known in collectors circles as a collector of eclectic timepieces from his home town favorite Ball to expensive Glashutte Origina, Zenith, Omega and IWC. His keen eye to mechanics and artistic design encouraged the GPHG to invite him to join the rotating group of 26 jurors in Geneva this November as they select the best watches of 2015.

A physically attractive woman accompanying, or \\"seconding\\", a male wrestler to a match is sometimes referred to as a valet. Performers who assume this role may be non-wrestlers, occasional wrestlers, older wrestlers who have retired or are nearing retirement, or new wrestlers who are breaking into the business (or a specific company) and need experience in front of the crowds. The wrestler who is paired with a manager may be referred to as his or her charge, client, or ward. A professional wrestling manager has nothing to do with their real-world counterpart or with a promotion's road agent.  Role  Paul Ellering (center) managing The Authors of Pain Managers are somewhat like storyline agents for an actor or an athlete; they help their client to book matches and appearances, and otherwise work to further and guide their career. Within the context of storylines, the manager positions their client for title opportunities, generally acts as a mouthpiece on their behalf, decides whom to trust as an ally, or serves as an exposed Achilles' heel to be exploited by their client's opponents. Managers could be utilized by a promotion's booker to instigate and strengthen storylines; their involvement could form the center of a controversy, for instance if they double-cross their clients or inadvertently cause the loss or forfeiture of their clients' championship titles. Outside of storylines, a manager's job is to help the wrestler they are paired with get over. The manager would cut promos on behalf of clients who may not be as charismatic (or had gimmicks depicting them as silent, or with limited ability to speak English). As such, successful managers almost invariably had the \\"gift of the gab\\", though it was not unheard of to see managers paired with wrestlers who had no trouble cutting their own promos. A notable example of this would be CM Punk, who was managed by Paul Heyman from 2012 to 2013. Punk had no trouble cutting his own promos, but Heyman would also cut his own promos alongside Punk in support of his client's act. Paul Bearer carrying the urn he used to control The Undertaker While the basic goal of a manager to give his or her wrestlers a push does not change, the tactics depend on several factors, especially alignment. Managers, when used judiciously, can completely change the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match. A heel manager, for example, may instruct their clients to constantly duck tougher opponents or interfere in their matches to secure a win by cheating. A face manager, on the other hand, may spend the majority of their interview time talking about how tough their client is and going out of their way to find bigger and better opponents to challenge, or rally the audience to chant and cheer in support of their client during matches. Often the very act of aligning with a manager, or conversely breaking away from a manager they've worked with, can change a wrestler's alignment, making them a sudden fan favorite or heel. Certain wrestlers employ a specific kind of manager known as a \\"handler.\\" If a wrestler's character calls for it, a handler is the only person who can manage the behaviour of a \\"wild\\" wrestler's who is prone to \\"go out of control\\". A classic example of this was The Undertaker, who in his early Deadman persona could only be controlled by Paul Bearer, through an urn which was said to have all of the Undertaker's powers. A legitimate example is Arnold Skaaland, who not only managed Andre The Giant for a time but was once assigned by promoter Vince McMahon Sr. as his real life handler. Skaaland was responsible for keeping Andre, known for his alcoholism, out of serious trouble and to ensure that he would reach a venue in time to wrestle a scheduled match. A few managers, like Paul Ellering, are legitimate managers in the truest sense of the word, taking care of the day-to-day needs of their clients by dealing with travel arrangements, rentals, lodgings and even contractual negotiations. Others, such as Jim Cornette or Gary Hart, participate as real-life bookers and/or road agents for their promotions behind the scenes while performing concurrently as managers.  History  Blackjack Lanza with longtime manager Bobby Heenan In the early years of pro wrestling, the vast majority of professional wrestling managers were men, and female managers were rare. A number of prominent women like Miss Elizabeth, Sherri Martel and Woman made their debuts during the 1980s professional wrestling boom and went on to have storied careers in several wrestling promotions as wrestling managers. Up until the mid-1990s, managers were very common because they served a secondary purpose: \\"getting heat.\\" During the territorial era, most managers did not travel from territory to territory, but instead remained in one territory to provide instant heat to the promotion's new heel acts. Notable examples include \\"The Mouth of The South\\" Jimmy Hart in Memphis, Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan in the American Wrestling Association, and the \\"Three Wise Men\\" (Lou Albano, Freddie Blassie, and The Grand Wizard) in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now the WWE). By the 2000s, major promotions like the WWE have favoured elevating the careers of wrestlers who are able to speak for themselves. As a result, the previously ubiquitous role of a manager has declined in favor of either female valets who occasionally get involved in wrestling matches, or by people who hold on-screen power as General Managers, Commissioners or various corporate officer positions. However, contemporary wrestling personalities such as Paul Heyman and Vickie Guerrero have demonstrated that managers are still effective at drawing heat, and when used judiciously, are capable of changing the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match by contributing drama and tension.  Nomenclature  Maryse depicted as a manager or valet for The Miz, her real life husband. Although managers and valets are terms used interchangeably for a woman who accompanies a wrestler to the ring, a major point of difference is that the former is usually depicted as a professional spokesperson who crafts and/or guides a wrestler's career, while the latter may serve as little more than eye candy and/or as a distraction to opposing wrestlers or referees with their sex appeal. The role of a valet is a significant part of professional wrestling history, at least within the context of North American industry. Historically, North American women wrestlers often received less attention or recognition compared to their male counterparts and often did not enjoy the same exposure compared to their Japanese or Mexican counterparts. As a result, the purpose of a valet role is to provide female talent more opportunities as well as visibility within the industry. It is thought that a valet, by virtue of her presence and/or the dynamics of her relationship with her associated wrestler, could contribute an element that amplifies their personas and get their act over. Many valets are not required to cut promos on their associated wrestler's behalf and generally have rather passive roles, since their physical appearance tend to be emphasized at the exclusion of all other traits; other valets may deviate from convention and assert a dominant role over their wrestlers, if their characters call for it. In spite of their limited wrestling ability, perceived or otherwise, valets are more likely to participate in the occasional wrestling match in comparison to managers, and are frequently booked in mixed tag team matches against rival valets and their associated wrestlers as part of storyline angles. There are also numerous examples of female performers in the wrestling industry who started off as valets and went on to be recognized as marquee competitors in their own right, such as Lita, Trish Stratus, and The Fabulous Moolah. Male supporting characters who fit the original definition of a valet are uncommon in professional wrestling; a recent example was Ricardo Rodriguez, who performed as Alberto Del Rio's on-screen attendant and personal ring announcer during his tenure in the WWE. A male performer who accompanies a prominent female wrestler to the ring could be considered a valet as well, though this is exceptionally rare. Tomko (left) working as Christian's enforcer While they are not managers in the traditional sense, enforcers ‚Äî full-time wrestlers who accompany another wrestler to the ring ‚Äî also serve both in and out of storylines to further the interests of a wrestler in their care. Larger but less charismatic wrestlers are conventionally booked in the role of an enforcer; this is done so that these wrestlers can get over with the crowd by sharing the charisma of the wrestler they accompany. A wrestler can also be the enforcer for an entire stable, traditionally serving as the biggest and strongest individual in the group (if not the entire promotion). In this scenario, the enforcer is utilized to \\"protect\\" the leader of the faction, and is often relegated to tag team matches to help them get over with the fans. Enforcers appear in storylines where wrestlers need to have their back watched by keeping outside interference from taking place in a match, to serve as outside interference themselves, or to further a storyline without actually recording a real match by defending their associates from ambushes outside the ring by other wrestlers. The Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) had a unique gimmick where instead of a long term association with one wrestler, tag team or stable, they would be hired by different wrestlers each week to act as their bodyguards or to prevent outside interference. Perhaps the best-known example in professional wrestling history is Arn Anderson, whose career has been highlighted by his association with Ric Flair and various members of The Four Horsemen stable as \\"The Enforcer\\".

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 2,583 (54.9%) people were employed full-time, 717 (15.3%) were part-time, and 138 (2.9%) were unemployed. History In 1882, the St Heliers and Northcote Land Company was formed and some land in the area was subdivided. In 1889 a major subdivision was the result when the Bartley Estate was auctioned. Before the construction of the Harbour Bridge, the Northcote Wharf was heavily utilised by Auckland Harbour ferry services. After the bridge was opened in 1959, the number of ferry crossings fell and the Northcote Point peninsula became a quiet cul-de-sac. The wooden Northcote Tavern was once in the thick of things; it still stands but now surveys a quiet streetscape. Local government Northcote had a local government just like other suburbs in Auckland at that time. The local government was called Northcote Borough Council, which started in 1908 and merged into North Shore City Council in 1989. It then amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010. =Mayors of Northcote Borough Council= *1908 Alexander Bruce *1908‚Äì1912 Herbert Cadness *1912‚Äì1917 George Fraser *1917‚Äì1919 John Byrne Tonar *1919‚Äì1921 Arthur Edwin Greenslade *1921‚Äì1925 William Ernest Richardson *1925‚Äì1927 Charles Archibald Deuxberry *1927‚Äì1931 Arthur Edwin Greenslade *1931‚Äì1941 Robert Martin *1941‚Äì1944 Ernest Clyde Fowler *1944‚Äì1956 Frank Montagne Pearn *1956‚Äì1962 John Forsyth Potter *1962‚Äì1968 Albert Ernest James Holdaway *1968‚Äì1974 Alfred James Evans *1974‚Äì1979 Trevor Edwin La Roche *1979‚Äì1989 Jean Sampson Features and landmarks Northcote is surrounded by the suburbs of Birkenhead, Hillcrest and Takapuna to the west and north, and the waters of Shoal Bay, an arm of the Waitemata, to the south and east. State Highway 1 stretches along the waterfront of Shoal Bay, heading north from the bridge towards Albany. To the north of Northcote Point on one of the main routes leading to and from the Harbour Bridge is the Northcote Shopping Centre, which was developed in the early 1960s. It is now a multi-cultural retail hub featuring many Asian food outlets. Education Northcote College is a coeducational secondary (years 9‚Äì13) school with a roll of . It was established in 1877. During its early years, the College incorporated Standards five and six (Forms one and two) which were transferred to Northcote Intermediate School when that was established as a separate entity on its present site in Lake Road in Northcote Central in 1958. Northcote Primary School is a coeducational contributing primary (years 1‚Äì6) school with a roll of . It was established on its present site in 1918.

Their style is influenced by art punk and post-hardcore. The group is known for the stage presence of lead singer Tim Harrington. The band is signed to Frenchkiss Records, which is owned by the band's bassist, Syd Butler. Biography The group's original 1995 line-up all met while attending the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. Some of its members were classmates of Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Live shows are punctuated by the antics of frontman Harrington, including interacting with audience members and on-stage wardrobe changes. The rest of the band continues to play as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening. Guitar player Gibb Slife left the band after their second LP. Drummer Mahoney was replaced by Harrison Haynes. The band started a planned hiatus in mid-2005, which led to speculation that they might have broken up, but Harrington confirmed that Les Savy Fav would return and indeed they did, playing a live performance at the British All Tomorrow's Parties festival in May 2007. Andrew Reuland joined the band in 2006 as the second guitar player. The band booked studio time in November of that year to record their fourth full-length album, Let's Stay Friends, which was released September 18, 2007. They performed \\"Patty Lee\\" live on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on January 31, 2008. Their song \\"Hold Onto Your Genre\\" is featured in the soundtrack to MLB 2K7, as well as commercials for the game. Furthermore, their song \\"Raging in the Plague Age\\" is featured on an in-game radio station in GTA IV. Bass player Syd Butler is also the owner of Frenchkiss Records. Seth Jabour is also known for his work as an illustrator and graphic designer. Former drummer Pat Mahoney also played in LCD Soundsystem. The Derry/London based band Jetplane Landing included a song on their 2007 album Backlash Cop entitled \\"Why Do They Never Play Les Savy Fav On The Radio?\\" The song \\"The Sweat Descends\\" appears in the commercial for the Cartoon Network movie, \\"Fire Breather\\". The True Blood episode 'Let's Get Out of Here' was named for the band's song, which is featured in the episode. In December 2011, the band co- curated the All Tomorrow's Parties \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" festival in Minehead, England alongside Battles and Caribou. The song ‚ÄúThe Equestrian‚Äù is featured on the soundtrack for NHL 2K8. Some of the band's members are now in the house band for Late Night With Seth Meyers. In 2020, the band was booked to play at Primavera Sound's twentieth anniversary. Music style Initially their music featured an abrasive sound fitting in the noise rock genre and reminiscent of the music of Fugazi and Jawbox. Later on their music became more idiosyncratic shifting to a more radio-friendly sound close to that of befriended bands Bloc Party and Enon. Kele Okereke of Bloc Party wrote of Les Savy Fav's influence on his band for an article in The Observer in 2005 and members of Enon have contributed to several Les Savy Fav tracks.

At its peak, the BCOF comprised about 40,000 personnel, equal to about 25% of the number of US military personnel in Japan. History and role Whilst US forces were responsible for military government, the BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarisation and the disposal of Japan's war industries.British Commonwealth Occupation Force 1945‚Äì52, AWM. The BCOF was also responsible for the occupation of the western prefectures of Shimane, Yamaguchi, Tottori, Okayama, Hiroshima and Shikoku Island. BCOF headquarters was at Kure, a naval port near Hiroshima. For most of the occupation period Australia contributed the majority of the BCOF's personnel. The initial BCOF presence included the Australian 34th Brigade; the 9th Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (J Force); and BRINDIV (sometimes known as BRINJAP), a composite British and Indian division made up of the British 5th Infantry Brigade Group (from 2nd Infantry Division in India), and the 268th Indian Infantry Brigade. BCOF was supported by the Women's Auxiliary Service (Burma) (which derived its name from its formation during the Second World War, to provide amenities to Commonwealth forces in the Burmese campaign). The position of commanding officer of BCOF was always filled by an Australian: Lieutenant General John Northcott, February to June 1946; Lieutenant General Horace Robertson, June 1946 to November 1951, and Lieutenant General William Bridgeford from November 1951 until the end of the occupation. BRINDIV was commanded by Major General David Cowan, from 1945 to 1947. The British Pacific Fleet initially provided most of the naval forces. The air contingent, known as BCAIR, initially comprised the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 81 Fighter Wing, flying P-51 Mustangs, four Spitfire squadrons (including No. 11 and No. 17 of the Royal Air Force and No. 4 of the Indian Air Force), and No. 14 Squadron of the Royal New Zealand Air Force flying F4U Corsairs. During 1947, the BCOF began to wind down its presence in Japan. However, BCOF bases provided staging posts for Commonwealth forces deployed to the Korean War, from 1950 onwards. The BCOF was effectively wound-up in 1951, as control of Commonwealth forces in Japan was transferred to British Commonwealth Forces Korea.

It was a class of heavy mixed-traffic locomotives of the 4-8-2 \\"Mountain\\" arrangement, which uses four pairs of driving wheels with a four-wheel guiding truck in front for stability at speed and a two-wheel trailing truck to support the large firebox needed for sustained power. Although built for both passenger and freight work, they spent most of their service lives hauling heavy high-speed freight trains. Many PRR men counted the M1 class locomotives as the best steam locomotives the railroad ever owned. History A single prototype, #6699, was built in 1923 at the railroad's Altoona Works. It spent three years in testing, including all kinds of main line service as well as a session on the railroad's static test plant. Having received favorable reports, a further 200 were ordered from commercial locomotive builders; 175 from the Baldwin Locomotive Works and 25 from Lima Locomotive Works. Breaking with the PRR tradition of random locomotive numbering, these were numbered in a solid block from #6800-#6999. In 1930 100 more were ordered; this class M1a had several improvements. Instead of separate cylinder block and smokebox saddle castings, the M1a had a one-piece casting (first seen on the K5 Pacific) with inside steam delivery pipes, instead of the outside, visible pipes of the M1. A Worthington feedwater heater was installed, with a boxlike mixing chamber behind the stack. Twin cross-compound air compressors were hung next to each other on the left side, instead of the single compressor of the M1. The M1a locomotives had larger tenders than the previous locomotives. The M1a locomotives were intended for passenger as well as freight service, and some bore decorative gold-leaf lining on tender and cab sides, but they proved better suited to freight work, and extensive electrification saw a surplus of K4s locomotives available for passenger trains. While they were mostly used on freight, their dual service purpose entitled them to have smokebox mounted keystone shaped numberplates. Freight engines on the Pennsy had circular numberplates. The twin cross-compound air compressors on the side of the M1a. Like most PRR steam locomotives, the M1 and M1a featured the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. The square-topped section continued ahead of the firebox proper, revealing the presence of a combustion chamber - an extended firebox, giving more room for complete combustion of burning gases. The standard M1/M1a boiler used a working pressure of . 38 locomotives were later converted into class M1b; the differences were all in the boiler, those being the addition of firebox circulators--large tubes carrying water passing through the firebox space, increasing water circulation and heating area, and thus steam generation--and an increase in boiler pressure to . The only externally visible difference was extra cleaning plugs in the firebox sides, for washing out the circulators. The M1b had greater tractive effort, thanks to the greater pressure, and more power at speed. All were fitted with driving wheels, two cylinders, and cast-steel KW pattern trailing trucks, similar to those fitted to K4s Pacifics. M1 and M1a tractive effort was while that of the M1b was . Weight was . PRR standard small steel cabs were used. A spotting feature was a large cross-mounted air tank at the front of the locomotive above the pilot. There was a family resemblance with other PRR locomotives. After World War II the M1 locomotives underwent similar front-end changes to those made to the K4s, including sheet steel drop-coupler pilots, the moving of the headlight to the smokebox top in front of the stack, the moving of the steam-driven generator to the smokebox front for easier maintenance, and the addition of a wide step above the air tank to service the air compressor. Pennsylvania Railroad M1b #6755 at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania on July 31, 2015. A variety of tenders were fitted to M1 locomotives, of steadily increasing size. During later years some hauled sixteen-wheel 210-F-75B tenders almost as long as the locomotives themselves. All were fitted with scoops to pick up water from track pans. On the rear tender decks, all were later fitted with \\"doghouses\\" for the head-end brakeman on freight trains, giving him a view backward over the train and placing him out of the way of the engineer and fireman. Many had railing-like trainphone antennas added during the 1940s. As dieselization progressed the M1 locomotives were assigned heavier trains, while the diesels were assigned the high-speed freight trains previously the M1s' preserve. Their final years of service saw them hauling heavier trains than ever. Many remained in service until the withdrawal of steam from the PRR in mid 1957. Preservation One locomotive, M1a #6755, was saved from the scrapper's torch for the PRR's historical collection housed at Northumberland, Pennsylvania. It is now in the possession of the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as Locomotive No. 6755. The tender of M1 #6659, minus the engine has also preserved and was purchased by the Pennsylvania Railroad T1 Steam Locomotive Trust in August 2017. The tender will be restored for eventual use behind the new build T1 class locomotive #5550.

Although mostly Neotropical in distribution, the family is also represented both in the Nearctic and the Palearctic.  Description  The family includes small to medium-sized species, from 12 to 60 mm wingspan, often with vibrant structural colouring. The wing shape is very different within the family. They may resemble butterflies in other groups, some are similar to Satyrinae, some are bright yellow reminiscent of Coliadinae and others (examples Barbicornis, Rhetus arcius, Helicopis, Chorinea) have tails as do Papilionidae. The colouration ranges from muted colours in the temperate zone species to iridescent blue and green wings and transparent wings in tropical species.Thomas C. Emmel, Edward S. Ross (Hrsg.): Wunderbare und geheimnisvolle Welt der Schmetterlinge. 1. Auflage. Bertelsmann, G√ºtersloh und Berlin 1976 (√ºbersetzt von Irmgard Jung), . The golden or silvery metallic spots on the wings in many species of the Americas gave them the English common name \\"metalmarks\\". A number of species mimic poisonous moths of several families and there are often extensive mimicry rings of similar-looking species, grouped around a model.Mathieu Joron (2008): Batesian Mimicry: Can a Leopard Change Its Spots ‚Äî and Get Them Back? Current Biology Volume 18, Issue 11: R476‚ÄìR479. doi:10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.009 Mimicry causes often closely related species to have completely different wing patterns, for example the genus Thisbe.Carla M. Penz & Philip J. DeVries (2001): A phylogenetic reassessment of Thisbe and Uraneis butterflies (Riodinidae, Nymphidiini). Contributions in Science 485: 1-27. Many species mimic the stain and stripe pattern of toxic Nymphalidae. Batesian mimicry seems to be more common than in any other insect family of similar size.K.S. Brown Jr., B. von Schoultz, A.O. Saura, A. Saura (2012): Chromosomal evolution in the South American Riodinidae (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea). Hereditas 149: 128‚Äì138. doi:10.1111/j.1601-5223.2012.02250.x .. Reasons for this are unknown. Another example is Ithomeis where different subspecies resemble the species they mimic in different parts of the geographic range more than they resemble each other. The delimitation from the closely related Lycaenidae by morphological autapomorphy is difficult.Rienk de Jong, Philip R. Ackery, Richard I. Vane-Wright (1996):The higher classification of butterflies (Lepidoptera): problems and prospects. Insect Systematics & Evolution, Volume 27, Issue 1: 65 ‚Äì 101. doi:10.1163/187631296X00205. The first pair of legs of the males, which arises on the prothorax, is less than half as long as the legs of the pterothorax and they are not used for walking. The individual segments of the tarsus are sometimes fused together and fused with the tibia, and the pretarsi have no claws. This feature is also found in some Lycaenidae (and also the Monotrysia), but in these the legs are always much longer. The sensory hairs on the tarsi of the female forelimbs are arranged in a group. These groups which are arranged in pairs can be found in the other taxa of the Papilionoidea. The third problematic apomorphy is the absence of the rear projections (apophyses) of the female genitalia. This feature (absence) is found as well in some species of the subfamily of Poritiinae. In almost all Riodinidae, the coxae of the front legs are extended on males jutting out over the trochanter (only hinted at in Styx infernalis and Corrachia leucoplaga). If there are similar projections in Lycaenidae (in genera Curetis, Feniseca and Poritia), they are built differently in detail and may be, for example, dorsally convex.Robert K. Robbins (1988): Comparative morphology of the butterfly foreleg coxa and trochanter (Lepidoptera) and its systematic implications. Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington 90 (2): 133-154. In addition, almost all Riodinidae in contrast to the Lycaenidae have a humeral vein in the hindwings and the costa is thickened (exceptions in the subfamily Hamearinae). The head in relation to the eyes is wider than in Lycaenidae, making the antennal bases further away from the eye. The relatively long antennae often reach half of the front wing length. Riodinidae have an unusual variety in chromosome numbers, only some very basal groups have the number typical for butterflies (between 29 and 31) or the number characteristic of Lycaenidae (23 to 24). Numbers between 9 and 110 occur. In some cases, representatives of a morphologically indistinguishable cryptospecies have different chromosome numbers and are reproductively isolated.  Distinguishing features  Like the lycaenids, the males of this family have reduced forelegs while the females have full-sized, fully functional forelegs. The foreleg of males is often reduced and has a uniquely shaped first segment (the coxa) which extends beyond its joint with the second segment, rather than meeting it flush. They have a unique venation on the hindwing: the costa of the hindwing is thickened out to the humeral angle and the humeral vein is short.Borror et al. (1989)  Taxonomy and systematics  Riodinidae is currently treated as a distinct family within the superfamily Papilionoidea, but in the past they were held to be the subfamily Riodininae of the Lycaenidae. Earlier, they were considered to be part of the now defunct family Erycinidae, whose species are divided between this family and the subfamily Libytheinae. Today, most systematists prefer to accept an independent family even if there are counter arguments.Zhao F, Huang DY, Sun XY, Shi QH, Hao JS, Zhang LL, Yang Q.

Amazonas tropical rainforest is the habitat for most species of Riodinidae  Biology  Species occur in a variety of habitats, but have a unique distribution focus in the tropical rain forests of South America.J.P.W. Hall (2004): Metalmark Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Riodinidae) In J.L. Capinera (editor) Encyclopedia of Entomology, Vol. 2 Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004. pp. 1383‚Äì1386. Many species are rarely found and have a relatively small distribution area. Species of the genus Charis were therefore used to reconstruct the history of the forest of the Amazon basin: each of the 19 species has a vicariant distribution area, three originally separate forests (upper, lower Amazonas, Guyana) can be derived from the relationship of between the species.Jason P.W. Hall & Donald J. Harvey (2002): The phylogeography of Amazonia revisited: new evidence from Riodinid butterflies. Evolution, 56(7): 1489‚Äì1497. The food plants for the caterpillars total more than 40 plant families. Mostly young leaves or flowers are used, and rarely fallen, dead leaves or lichen are eaten. The larvae feed mostly individually not gregariously. However, gregarious caterpillars are found within the Euselasiinae (Euselasia), Riodinini (Melanis) and Emesini (Emesis), with some species demonstrating processionary behaviours. Available evidence from Euselasia and Hades suggests the gregarious trait may be widespread among members of the subfamily Euselasiinae.P.J. DeVries, I.A. Chacon & D. Murray (1992) Toward a better understanding of host use and biodiversity in riodinid butterflies (Lepidoptera). Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera, 31(1-2):103-126. The larva of Setabis lagus (Riodininae: Nymphidiini), is predatory. There are records of predation on larvae of Horiola species (family Membracidae) as well as scale insects (Coccidae). Predatory feeding has also been shown in Alesa amesis.DeVries, P.J. & C.M. Penz. 2000. Entomophagy, behavior, and elongated thoracic legs in the myrmecophilous Neotropical butterfly Alesa amesis (Riodinidae). Biotropica 32: 712-721. A number of species associate with and are protected by ants during one or more stages of their life cycle.DeVries, P. J. 1997. The Butterflies of Costa Rica and their Natural History. II: Riodinidae. Princeton Univ. Press, New Jersey, p. 288. A study in Ecuador based on adult male feeding records for 124 species in 41 genera of Riodinidae (out of a total of 441 species in 85 genera collected in the study) demonstrated that rotting fish and other carrion was the most frequently used food source in terms of numbers of individuals and taxa, attracting 89 species from 32 genera. Other food substrates visited in this study included flowers, damp sand or mud-puddlingJason P.W. Hall & Keith R. Willmott (2000): Patterns of feeding behaviour in adult male riodinid butterflies and their relationship to morphology and ecology. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 69: 1‚Äì23. doi:10.1006/bijl.1999.0345.  Life cycle  The eggs vary in shape, but often appear round and flattened, some have the shape of a dome or turban. They are similar to the eggs of the Lycaenidae. The caterpillars are usually hairy and plump, and are the common overwintering stage. The caterpillars are usually longer than those of the Lycaenidae except in the myrmecophilous species. Pupae are hairy and attached with silk to either the host plant or to ground debris or leaf litter. No cocoon is seen. Several genera of Riodinidae have evolved intimate associations with ants, and their larvae are tended and defended by ant associates. This also is the case with several linages of Lycaenidae and contributed to arguments for the uniting the two families. It is now recognized that myrmecophily arose several times among Riodinidae and Lycaenidae clades. But there are counter arguments. Like their sister family Lycaenidae, numerous species of Riodinidae are myrmecophiles (involving about 280 ant species). The larvae of many species have special organs, which have a soothing or tempting effect on ants. Many Riodinidae larvae have so-called \\"tentacle nectary organs\\" on the eighth segment of the abdomen that secrete a fluid which is eaten by ants. Other tentacle organs on the third thoracic segment have been shown to emit allomones which influence ants. Studies suggest caterpillar acoustic signals are used to enhance their symbioses with ants (see singing caterpillars). The location of riodinid organs that function in caterpillar-ant symbioses differs from those found in the Lycaenidae, suggesting that the organs in these two families of butterflies are not homologous in origin.DeVries, P. J. 1991. Ecological and evolutionary patterns in riodinid butterflies. IN: Ant-Plant Interactions. C. Huxley & D. F. Cutler (eds.) Oxford Univ. Press, pp. 143-156. = Food plants = The larvae feed on plants of the families Araceae, Asteraceae, Bromeliaceae, Bombacaceae, Cecropiaceae, Clusiaceae, Dilleniaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Loranthaceae, Malpighiaceae, Marantaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, Orchidaceae, Rubiaceae, Sapindaceae, Zingiberaceae as well as bryophytes and lichens.DeVries, P.J. (2001): [Riodinidae]. In Levin, S.A. (ed.): Encyclopaedia of Biodiversity. Academic Press.  Economic significance  The importance of Riodinidae species considered pests is very low. Some species of Euselasiinae feed on Myrtaceae of economic importance such as guava. A few Riodininae are specified as harmful to farmed Bromeliaceae or Orchidaceae.

Accessed November 13, 2008. A sequel, Super Troopers 2, was released on April 20, 2018.  Plot  In the fictional town of Spurbury, Vermont, five Vermont state troopers patrol a 50-mile section of the highway. While troopers Arcot Ramathorn and the rookie, Robert \\"Rabbit\\" Roto are tormenting a group of men for smoking marijuana, they encounter a crazed attacker, who is revealed to be their fellow officer, MacIntyre Womack, playing a prank on them. Back at the station, they are chastised for a lack of arrests by their boss, Captain John O'Hagen, who warns them that they risk being shut down. They also torment the radio dispatcher, Rodney Farva, who has been suspended. While investigating a Winnebago, they encounter a woman who died from a drug overdose with a tattoo of a monkey. Once outside the trailer, the state troopers encounter their rivals, the local Spurbury police, with whom they compete for arrests. When Foster and Womack pull over a truck for avoiding a weigh-station, they are locked inside while the driver flees. After Ramathorn and Rabbit rescue them, they find packages with stickers depicting the same monkey seen on the dead woman's tattoo. Foster begins a relationship with Spurbury PD officer Ursula Hanson and discovers marijuana hidden in the impounded Winnebago, bearing the same monkey sticker. Farva is reinstated to the force and becomes Ramathorn's partner. While at a restaurant, Farva attacks a cashier in retaliation for cutting a hole in his drink. Farva is arrested by the Spurbury police, where he receives a job offer from Police Chief Bruce Grady in exchange for information about the drug investigation, but Farva flippantly refuses. Farva is subsequently admonished and reprimanded by O'Hagan and demoted (and also blacklisted from the aforementioned restaurant). The Vermont governor travels to Spurbury for a press conference about the drug bust. Knowing that the Spurbury police will be involved with the governor's visit, Ramathorn and Foster break into the Spurbury police office to steal the Winnebago to present the marijuana as evidence. At the press conference, Chief Grady claims credit for the drug bust, despite it being the work of the State troopers. Foster thinks that Ursula revealed the location of the marijuana to her boss in exchange for a promotion. Having failed to increase arrests, the state troopers expect their unit to be shut down. Back at the station, the state troopers find Farva dressed in a Spurbury PD uniform; Foster realizes that it was him, not Ursula, who betrayed the location of the marijuana. The troopers, including Captain O'Hagen, tie Farva to a toilet and drunkenly vandalize Chief Grady's house. Ursula offers to help them and directs them to one of the drug- running trucks. As they attempt to pursue it, they encounter Farva, who holds them at gunpoint. The state troopers convince Farva to help them in pursuing the drug runners and follow the truck to a nearby airfield. The state troopers see Chief Grady arrive, only to realize that the Spurbury police are working alongside the drug dealers. Using a sex doll on top of Farva's car, the state troopers distract the Spurbury police officers long enough to attack and arrest them. The governor sends Captain O'Hagen a letter thanking him for his efforts, but tells him that their station will still be shut down. Three months later, Ramathorn and Rabbit are delivering beer to a party hosted by teenagers. As the teenagers torment them, they reveal that they are undercover Spurbury police, having replaced all of the officers after the drug bust.

The Glenbrook Steel Mill's iron plant. New Zealand Steel Limited is the owner of the Glenbrook Steel Mill, the steel mill located 40 kilometres south of Auckland, in Glenbrook, New Zealand. The mill was constructed in 1968 and began producing steel products in 1969. Currently, the mill produces 650 000 tonnes of steel a year which is either domesticity used or exported. Over 90% of New Zealand's steel requirements are produced at Glenbrook while the remaining volume is produced by Pacific Steel, a steel recycling facility in Otahuhu, Auckland. The mill is served by the Mission Bush Branch railway line, which was formerly a branch line to Waiuku. Coal and lime trains arrive daily. Steel products are also transported daily. The mill employs 1,150 full-time staff and 200 semi-permanent contractors. New Zealand Steel is notable due to its unique utilization of ironsand as its ore. Because ironsand is a low grade ore with many contaminants, the mill's primary plants' operations and equipment are unusual. History The west coast beaches of the North Island of New Zealand, between Kaipara Harbour and Whanganui, contain ironsand deposits rich in the mineral titanomagnetite. From the late 19th century to the 1950s, there were many unsuccessful attempts to smelt steel from the ironsands. In 1954, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research began investigating smelting from the ironsands. In 1959, The New Zealand Government established the NZ Steel Investigating Company under the Iron and Steel Industry Act 1959 as a vehicle for the investigations. New Zealand Steel Limited was incorporated by the New Zealand Government in 1965. In 1967, construction started on a mill at Glenbrook. Commercial operations began in 1968, with imported feed coil being used to produce steel for domestic and Pacific Island markets. The company pioneered the direct reduction process for reducing iron oxide (ironsand) into metallic iron. This culminated in the commissioning in 1970 of iron and steelmaking facilities to produce billets for domestic and export markets. Expansion continued with the commissioning of a pipe plant in 1972 and a prepainting line in 1982. Total output at this time averaged 300 000 tonnes a year. In the Think Big era of New Zealand industrialisation, the mill was upgraded. In 1987, New Zealand Steel was acquired by Equiticorp. However, Equiticorp was bankrupted in the New Zealand sharemarket crash of 1987. In 1989 New Zealand Steel was acquired by Helenus Corporation, which consisted of Fisher & Paykel, Steel & Tube, ANZ Bank and BHP. In 1992, BHP took up a controlling interest with an 81% shareholding by acquiring the shares of Fisher & Paykel and Steel & Tube. The company was initially renamed BHP New Zealand Steel Limited, but in 2002 it was renamed New Zealand Steel when BHP Steel was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange as BlueScope. The ore The ironsand ore is mined at an opencast mine at Waikato North Head. The ironsand is then mixed to form a slurry and transported to the mill by an 18 kilometre long pipeline. Approximately, 1.2 million tonnes of ironsand ore are delivered to the mill annually. The processes Glenbrook's iron plant contains four multiple hearth furnaces (MHFs), four rotary kilns, and two melters. The rotary kilns reduce the ore to metallic iron. This process is unusual as most mills use blast furnaces for this reduction process. In the steelmaking plant, vanadium recovery and removal is done due to the high vanadium content of the ironsand ore. Oxidation of the molten metal and contaminants is achieved by a basic oxygen steelmaking facility. The process used in the converter is the second unusual piece of equipment the mill operates : oxygen is blown on both top and bottom of the converter (Kl√∂ckner Oxygen Blown Maxh√ºtte process, or KOBM converter), whereas oxygen is only blasted at the top of the converter in most steelmaking plants.

The IMP was unconventional in configuration in having a pusher propeller powered by a long driveshaft from an engine mounted midway within the fuselage of the aircraft. This provided an aerodynamic advantage over more traditional pusher arrangements by allowing greater streamlining of the fuselage ‚Äì giving the IMP the appearance of an elongated teardrop. The aircraft's most visually striking feature, however, is its inverted V-tail. Originally designed as a four-seat aircraft, the original IMP design proved to be too complex and expensive for the market that Taylor was aiming for, and although it was awarded a type certification by the FAA, development was abandoned in favour of scaled-down, single-seat version dubbed the Mini-IMP.

In the late 1970s inquiries were made concerning a military version of the Mini-IMP, skinned with Kevlar, armed with two 7.62-millimeter machine guns, and with room in the baggage compartment for a considerable quantity of ammunition.

A commercial street including some embassies, it divides Fitzrovia, to the east, from Marylebone to the west. It delinates areas with contrasting identities, the west at strongest in grandiose Portland Place and Harley Street, the east at strongest in artists' and independent businesses of Fitzrovia. The street has its own unique character, due in part of the unusual combination of small shops combined with its strongly rectilinear character. Electorally it is split between the City of Westminster's Marylebone High Street and West End wards.City of Westminster GIS Team, Marylebone High Street Ward Map (PDF), August 2007 City of Westminster GIS Team, West End Ward Map, August 2007 Overview A view south down Great Portland Street from the Marylebone Road Long sections of Great Portland Street are in two Westminster City Council conservation areas, named after Harley Street and East Marylebone.City Of Westminster, CONSERVATION AREAS: A Guide for Property Owners (PDF), November 2004 It was gradually developed by a senior branch of the Cavendish-Bentinck family, the Dukes of Portland, who owned most of the eastern half of Marylebone in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was first rated as John Street in 1726. A campaign to add to its trees began in 2009. Historic influences Marylebone Toll Booth on Great Portland Street circa 1790 Fields north of Great Portland Street in the late 1700s Different owners and interests influenced development; these shaped the street's layout and character. Edward Harley ‚Äì Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, who married Lady Henrietta Cavendish ‚Äì was responsible for the development of the Portland Estate, building up Cavendish Square in 1717 then the rest of its land to the north and east. Great Portland stresses the descent of the land and buildings through Dukes' successive ownerships. Many local street names reflect their overall ownership, albeit less obviously. Development up to Great Titchfield Street was through the Portland Estate, competing against adjoining estates. The Berners family owned land to the east; they developed Wells Street and Rathbone Place in the mid-18th century. At the same time the Middlesex Hospital expanded on land on a 99-year lease around Mortimer Street, encroaching on Riding House and Cleveland Streets. These unrelated developers with different designs explains the asymmetrical street grid using the street as a basis; from the street many others start or end. Great Portland Street runs straight, north-south. The layout, combined with its width and the concentration of shops along its length, means it has for a long time been a local centre and thoroughfare, connecting the residential areas around Regent's Park with the West End. It has also resulted in it becoming a divider, emphasising the contrasting areas to either side. To the east, are artistic areas such as Fitzrovia, which have historically been less well-to-do than the west, with its grand parade of Portland Place, residential areas for the gentry, and doctors and medical institutions on Harley Street. Development and redevelopment Great Portland Street circa 1905 Development of the estate was gradual but particularly so on Great Portland Street. This had an effect during its redevelopment in the late-19th/early-20th centuries when rebuilding was dictated by the expiration of individual 99-year leases, and is evident in the buildings in existence today. The most coherent element to the architecture is the predominance of Edwardian buildings to the north and Victorian buildings towards Oxford Street, particularly noticeable when there has been occasional consolidation of plots, leading to consistent fa√ßades above street level such as in the block between Clipstone and Carburton Streets. The trend of period groupings is another result of the slowness of the first development. As buildings in the south were built earlier than those in the north, their leases expired earlier, setting off a wave of redevelopment which meant that rebuilding in the south took place in the late-Victorian era, whilst that in the north was delayed until the Edwardian. The Blitz made it necessary for further re-building after the war, although the damage incurred along the street was not particularly extensive so there are few modern buildings, and although the aesthetic today is a jumble of architectural styles and eras, the overall feel is that of an historic street. =Development over time= Maps from close to the outset of building help to identify the street's changes.  1746 (John Rocque's Map)  :The southern end of Great Portland Street (then shown as Portland Street) has been built as part of the development begun by Edward Harley and Lady Cavendish. With the exception of small villages at Mary Le Bone and Tottenham Court, the rest of the area to the north of Oxford Street is largely open fields. To the south, the street patterns which were the inspiration for the new development of formal squares and streets can be seen in places such as Soho Square.John Rocque's Map of London 1741-5, John Rocque, Map of London, 1741-5  1793 (Richard Horwood's Map)  Great Portland Street (then Portland Road) in Horwood's London 1792-9 :The street pattern of the whole area has been laid out almost exactly as it is today, with the appearance of Marylebone Road providing the northern boundary to the grid. Notable differences are the presence of Foley House where Langham Place is today, and Portland Place shown in its original design as a close of grand houses. Also, the line of Great Portland Street has been established but the buildings at the northern end have not been built, a curious gap as the streets parallel have largely been built up at this stage. One other curiosity in the planning of Great Portland Street, which still remains today, is its abrupt widening just north of Clipstone Street.Richard Horwood (1795) PLAN of the Cities of LONDON and WESTMINSTER the Borough of SOUTHWARK and PARTS adjoining Shewing every HOUSE , accessed 15 October 2010 :The impetus for the social pattern of affluence to the west and poverty to the east which has long-defined the area has been established with the houses along Portland Place and west of there being much larger than those to the east. These houses, clearly designed for the gentry have their own individual gardens and frequently mews, whilst the houses along Great Portland Street and the surrounding streets are noticeably smaller and would have accommodated the working classes involved in local trades.  1827 (Christopher Greenwood's Map)  Great Portland Street (still Portland Road) in Greenwood's map of London 1827 :Great Portland Street's buildings are still not complete at the northern end, although the rest of the area's present-day street pattern is now completely in place. This includes the appearance of Park Crescent and the transformation of Portland Place into a grand parade with the disappearance of Foley House. These two prominent features were part of Nash's scheme for the Prince Regent when the land to the north was returned to the Crown. This included the laying out of Regent's Park, which had previously remained an area of fields, and the creation of a 'royal mile', beginning at Park Crescent and leading down to Carlton House in the south.Christopher Greenwood (cartographer), Map of London, 1830, accessed 15 August 2010  1870 (Ordnance Survey Map)  :The whole street has been built up and is now united as one street under the name of Great Portland Street whereas previously it had gone by the name of John Street in the few blocks before Oxford Street and Portland Road at the north end. However, the slight widening of the street which used to mark the beginning of Portland Road is still visible at the corner of Weymouth Street. This feature probably would have contributed to the very northern end of the street being more heavily trafficked in comparison to the middle stretch, as is still the case today.Ordnance Survey Map of London London Sheet 61.1 The West End 1870, Records: 32876 & 32885, , Retrieved 6 May 2014 :There are signs of the demolition and rebuilding which was beginning to occur in this period and which continued through into the early years of the 20th century. The most noticeable evidence of this on the map is the large gap on the west side between Weymouth and New Cavendish Streets, where the modern synagogue is today. Otherwise, the street pattern and buildings remain largely the same in their layout.Map of London, Ordnance Survey, Edition of 1894-96, City of Westminster Archives, London  1889 (Booth's Poverty Map)  Charles Booth's Poverty Map of London of 1889 showing Great Portland Street :Booth's map shows Great Portland Street and the immediately parallel streets as middle-class/well-to-do whilst the accompanying notes describe it as a \\"mixed st., shops, restaurants, many curio and antique shops, many doubtful massage establishments\\". This vibrant description indicates that it is already something of a local centre, with a distinct catchment area made up of those \\"comfortable\\" households in the neighbouring streets. The mixed nature of the street described by Booth is not surprising given the general picture this map gives. The movement from 'wealthy' to 'poor' ‚Äì and even some 'very poor' households ‚Äì is striking as one travels west to east from Harley Street and Portland Place to Great Titchfield Street and beyond.Charles Booth, Life and Labour of the People in London, 1889, Poverty map copy available , accessed 15 October 2010  1916 (Ordnance Survey Map)  North end of Great Portland Street circa 1910 :The great redevelopment of this street has largely come to an end by this time. There are slight changes in some of the plots along the street, showing the further rebuilding and consolidation which had taken place in the previous few decades but otherwise, this street and its surrounding streets remain unchanged in their layout.Ordnance Survey Maps 1906-1922, Westminster City Council Archives, London  1945 (London Council Bomb Damage Maps)  Blitz damage to Eastern Marylebone :A few buildings along Great Portland Street were destroyed by bombing which explains some of the modern developments such as the synagogue opposite Clipstone Street, which was originally built in the late 19th century but damaged beyond repair in the Blitz. The street was cited in 28 separate A.R.P. bomb incident reports dated between September 1940 and 1944. Despite this, much of the street escaped with little or no damage although there was some bad damage nearby in Langham Place and further east around Fitzrovia, with several buildings in those areas being completely destroyed or requiring demolition.Bomb Damage Files of 1940-44, Bomb Damage Maps, Westminster City Council Archive Centre, London and Saunders, A (ed), 2005 The London Council Bomb Damage Maps 1939-1945, LTS Publications No. 164, London Broadcasters and media entities Communications dishes on Great Portland Street roofs The BBC Trust is based at ‚Ññ180BBC Trust - Contact us BBC Trust and until December 2012 BBC Radio 1's headquarters were on Great Portland Street in Yalding House.

During the late 1950 and 1960s, garment related businesses could be found all along the length of the street. The clothing trade took to this street, setting up small stock- and work rooms in the early 1900s. Over time, these grew into larger showrooms which represented the English textile industry to many West End stores. The sector's activities were most pronounced where the street intersects with Mortimer and Margaret Streets. Its proximity to buying officers working for the big stores on Oxford Street gave businesses in the area a competitive edge. The sector's local presence declined in the late 1970-80s with the disappearance of both the UK's independent retailer and the British textile industry. The growing dominance of UK chain stores, with their requirement for supply chain efficiencies from foreign low-cost suppliers, meant that new orders by-passed the showrooms and manufacturer's agents on the street and its vicinity. Major names of the garment industry associated with the street include Shubette of London, Coppernob, Alfred Young, Hildebrand and French Connection. Though some specialist niche market wholesalers survive the sector is now mainly represented on the street by garment importers.Interviews conducted with representatives area businesses and UK Fashion Textile Association during January 2011 Buildings and companies The street is split among Westminster Council's Harley Street Conservation and East Marylebone Conservation Areas.

Portuguese law is itself highly influenced by German law. However, many other influences are present, including Chinese law, Italian law, and some narrow aspects of common law. Macau's legal code is written in Portuguese; therefore law students at University of Macau take their classes in Portuguese. () Constitutional law The apex of the legal system is the Basic Law of the Macau SAR, a Chinese law approved in accordance with and due to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau (an international treaty that is officially deposited at the UN) and with article 31 of the Constitution of the PRC. Within Macau, the Basic Law has constitutional rank. The Basic Law of Macau is modelled upon the Basic Law of Hong Kong, although it is not totally equal, as it namely is influenced by the Portuguese Constitution in some points as, for example, in some norms concerning fundamental rights. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights applies in Macau. The transfer of power The legal system of Macau was not substantially modified in 1999, as a result of the transfer of power from Portugal to the PRC, given that there is a principle of continuity of the pre-existing legal system, according to which all sources in force prior to the transfer of sovereignty continued to apply, with some minor exceptions that were specified in December 1999. Judicial system The courts of the Macau SAR are structured in three levels and have final power of adjudication, except in very narrow areas. The Court of Final Appeal has three judges, and the Court of Second Instance has five judges. Trial by jury is foreseen in the law, but is not used. Prior to 1991, Macau judicial system was a sub-judiciary district of the judicial framework of the Portuguese legal system and was affiliated to the Judiciary District of Lisbon. High Court The Higher Court of Justice (Superior Court of Justice) of Macau replaced the role of Court of Appeal of the Judiciary District of Lisbon. This highest court would be replaced by the current Court of Appeal in 1999. The courts prior to the handover in 1999: * Superior Council of Magistrates * Superior Council of Public Prosecutors * Court of Justice of Macau * Criminal Preliminary Hearing Court of Macau * Administrative Court of Macau * Constitutional Court of the Republic of Portugal * Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of Portugal * Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Portugal * Audit Court of the Republic of Portugal The courts of Macau consist of: * Court of Final Appeal ‚Äì ÁµÇÂØ©Ê≥ïÈô¢/Tribunal de Ultima Inst√¢ncia * Court of General Competence * Administrative Court (Tribunal Administrativo) * Criminal Preliminary Hearing Court ‚Äì (Juizos de Instru√ß√£o Criminal) * Audit Court * Higher Court of Justice * Judiciary Council of Macau (Tribunal Judicial de Base) * Court of Second Instance or Court of Appeal (Tribunal de Segunda Inst√¢ncia) * Court of First Instance (Tribunais de Primeira Inst√¢ncia) * Primary Court of Macau ‚Äì ÂàùÁ¥öÊ≥ïÈô¢/(Tribunal Jud√≠cial de Base) * Judiciary Council of Macau (Conselho dos Magistrados Jud√≠ciais) Macau as a civil law legal system Macau is typically a civil law legal system, in that legislation is the main source of law and case law, while clearly relevant, is not a major source of law. Macau has the five 'classic' codifications: the Civil Code, the Commercial Code, the Civil Procedure Code, the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code. In addition, there are a number of other smaller codifications (e.g., in the field of administrative law). Private law Private law in Macau is basically codified in two separate codes: the 1999 Civil Code and the 1999 Commercial code. A number of other pieces of legislation, such as the law on standard contract terms, are also of importance. The Commercial Code has been translated into English and is freely available in the website of the Macau Official Printing House (see link below). For a partial translation of the Civil Code, see the bibliography below. Legal education The Faculty of Law of the University of Macau was created in the late 1980s and currently offers law degrees and master programmes conducted in Chinese and Portuguese languages. It also offers two master and postgraduate programmes in English, one in EU, international and comparative law, and the other in international business law . In addition, it offers PhD programs in law. Legal Department The Department of Public Prosecution (Ministerio Publico) is the judicial authority of Macau. It is led by the Prosecutor General and assisted by the Assistant-Prosecutor General. Day to day legal activities are performed by general prosecutors.

First unveiled in June 2004, it is the successor to the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) and Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) worn from the 1980s and 1990s through to the mid-2000s, respectively. It is also the successor to the Airman Battle Uniform for the U.S. Air Force. History =Development= In early 2004, some U.S. Army soldiers in Iraq were issued the \\"Close Combat Uniform\\" a variant of the Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) that featured new features such as shoulder pockets affixed with hook-and-loop \\"Velcro\\" fasteners, chest-worn rank insignia, and a new collar. The experimental features used on the CCU were eventually incorporated into the ACU, which was publicly announced in June 2004. =Initial fielding= The process of replacing the U.S. Army's BDUs and DCUs with the ACU was to set to begin in April 2005. However, the fielding process began two months earlier through the Rapid Fielding Initiative. Soldiers from the 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team were the first in the U.S. Army to receive the ACU, subsequently deploying with them into Iraq in May 2005. =Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP)= The ACU of a U.S. Navy sailor attached to a U.S. Army unit during the Iraq War, August 2009 The ACU originally used the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), which used a pixelated pattern of tan, gray and green (Desert Sand 500, Urban Gray 501 and Foliage Green 502) and was intended to work in desert, woodland, and urban environments. For uniforms, the pattern was fully phased out and replaced by the Operational Camouflage Pattern on 30 September 2019, though UCP remains in service in limited capacities such as on some cold weather overgear and older body armor.https://www.military.com/daily- news/2019/10/01/say-goodbye-hated-army-ucp-uniform.html =Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern (MultiCam)= Beginning in late 2010 U.S. Army soldiers deployed to Afghanistan (starting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade) were issued an Army-developed variant of the Crye Precision \\"MultiCam\\" pattern, known as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern (OEF, OEF-CP, or OCP),https://www.flickr.com/photos/peosoldier/4941359595/in/photolist-8wGLsb- iNazfb-8wDL46-8BzrDs-ruzEbs-8wDL5v-7FhDpE-6UUWEq-i86TPg-ezJ3qA-fMeQf4 which was far more effective for use in Afghanistan's terrain. The flame-retardant variants of the uniforms are designed to prevent third-degree burns, along with up to thirty percent of second degree burns. Additionally, all uniforms are treated with the chemical permethrin to help protect soldiers from insect- borne diseases like malaria. Some U.S. Army soldiers during the latter stages of the Iraq War also wore the OEF patterned ACU; some were seen wearing them as late as December 2011, when the United States withdrew its military forces from the country at the end of the war. The MultiCam-patterned ACUs were retired in 2019 with the UCP-patterned ones. =Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP)= In May 2014, the Army unofficially announced that the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) would replace UCP on the ACU. The original \\"Scorpion\\" pattern was developed at United States Army Soldier Systems Center by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan in 2010 as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named \\"Scorpion W2\\", noting that while a pattern can be copyrighted, a color palette cannot and that beyond 50 meters the actual pattern is \\"not that relevant.\\" The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and brown patches and no vertical twig and branch elements.Army selects new camo pattern - Armytimes.com, 23 May 2014 On 31 July 2014, the Army formally announced that the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015. The official name is intended to emphasize its use beyond Afghanistan to all combatant commands.Army announces rollout date for new camo - Armytimes.com, 31 July 2014 The OCP pattern fully replaced the UCP pattern on the ACU by 1 October 2019.Army Unveils Design Changes for New Camo Uniform - Military.com, 6 August 2014 ACUs printed in OCP first became available for purchase on 1 July 2015, with deployed soldiers already being issued uniforms and equipment in the new pattern.Soldiers Line Up to Buy New Camouflage Uniforms - Kitup.Military.com, 8 July 2015 The Air Force has also started to adopt the OCP Uniform from 2018 onward, with it slated to replace the Airman Battle Uniform by April 2021.https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air- force/2019/01/02/new-in-2019-the-roll-out-of-the-air-forces-new-combat- uniform-gains-steam/ The U.S. Space Force has also adopted the OCP uniform, but with navy blue thread for ranks and tapes.https://www.military.com/daily- news/2020/01/17/space-force-offers-first-peek-new-camouflage-uniform.html Components The ACU features hook-and-loop fasteners, also known by the genericized trademark Velcro, on its sleeve pockets. =Blouse= The ACU jacket originally used hook-and-loop-backed attachments to secure items such as name tapes, rank insignia, and shoulder patches and tabs, as well as recognition devices such as the U.S. flag patch and the infrared (IR) tab. Originally only pin-on skill badges were authorized for wear on the ACU, with no more than 5 at any one time. In the summer of 2011, regulations were changed to allow for wearing of sew-on embroidered skill badges. The 5-badge limit remained in effect, and there could be no mixing of sew-on and pin-on badges. At the same time, the branch tape, name tapes, and rank insignia could be sewn-on at the wearers preference.Army Combat Uniform Ensemble , paragraph 5L. Skill tabs, such as the President's Hundred Tab, Special Forces, Ranger, and Sapper are worn on the left sleeve pocket flap, and are subject to a 3-tab-only rule.Paragraph 5S. A tab that is an integral part of a unit patch, such as the \\"Mountain\\" or \\"Airborne\\" tab, is not counted against the rule. The U.S. Army Chaplain insignia is the only authorized army branch insignia to be worn on the ACU. It is centered 1/8 inch above the right name tape. The insignia may be the metal pin-on variety or the black embroidered insignia on digitized fabric with Velcro fasteners.Army Combat Uniform (ACU) ALARACT Message 007/2006 Near Infrared (NIR) Signature Management Technology is incorporated to minimize the infrared silhouette. Permanent IR IFF squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when night vision devices are used, and are protected by Velcro tabs in garrison or when not in use. Three U.S. flag insignia are authorized for wear with the ACU: full- color, full-color infrared, and subdued infrared. The U.S. flag insignia is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of the ACU coat. The subdued version is only worn as directed under tactical or field conditions in the Army, while the Air Force only authorizes the subdued flag. Subdued shoulder sleeve insignia are worn. The jacket's Mandarin collar was intended to be worn up in combat to fit with the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) body armor, and worn in the down position otherwise. With the change of pattern to OCP, the Velcro tab that closed the Mandarin collar was removed, along with other Velcro closures.Army Combat Uniform Summary of Changes Accessed 14 May 2017 The front closure is zippered and reinforced with Velcro, designed for use with OTV. The tilted chest pockets, cuffs, and elbow pad insert pockets also utilize hook-and-loop closure. There is a three slot pen pocket on the left arm of the jacket, and blouse bellows for increased mobility. The jacket is worn so that its bottom is between the bottom of the pocket and the top of the cargo pocket. In the field, the jacket may be replaced by the flame resistant Army Combat Shirt when worn directly under the IOTV. =Trousers= The ACU trousers (or ACU pants) are worn with a two-inch nylon web belt, and feature Velcro pouches for knee pad inserts, two forward-tilted thigh storage pockets with elastic drawstring and Velcro for closure during movement, and two calf storage pockets one on each pant leg with a Velcro closure. ACU trousers with flame resistant materials are being issued for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The updates to the ACU trousers in late 2010 included removal of Velcro fasteners from forward-tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons. This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward and is now in full effect. Two buttons are standard (same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets), while the third button located at the very end of the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets. On the small calf pockets the 3-piece Velcro (2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap) have been replaced with a single button in 2012. Buttons were re-introduced and replaced Velcro on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field. The belt loops are of new design. The width has doubled, and there are now 8 of them compared to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi- layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs at the bottom of the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons. To be able to differentiate the Fire-Retardant ACU (FRACU) from the regular ACU at a distance, a small square inch tan patch is affixed to the left sleeve cuff on the jacket and the middle of the left cargo pocket flap on the trousers. =Headgear= A U.S. Army soldier in March 2007 wears a helmet with a UCP camouflage cover during the Iraq War Typically, the ACU is worn with the Advanced Combat Helmet, a patrol cap, or a boonie hat and/or fleece cap as appropriate in winter months. The patrol cap is a kepi-styled straight-sided, flat-topped soft cap, with a double thick bill and internal pocket. When in garrison, the maroon, tan, brown, and green berets may be worn by paratroopers, rangers, advisors, and special forces respectively. The green micro fleece cap is authorized for field and garrison use outside of unit PT, per local command. A name tape is worn on the back of the patrol cap. Sew-on rank is recommended but pin-on rank is authorized on the ACU Patrol Cap and ACU Boonie Hat. The MICH (Modular Integrated Communications Helmet) Camouflage cover rank must be sewn on if worn but is often not used as the night vision device mount would obstruct it. =T-shirt= The ACU's UCP variant was typically worn with a moisture-wicking sand colored T-shirt. A Tan 499 T-shirt was authorized with the ACU's OCP variant and became the sole authorized T-shirt upon completion of the full transition to OCP in 2019. =Footwear= The UCP variant of the ACU was worn with tan Army Combat Boots and olive drab cotton socks. Commercial versions of this boot are authorized without limitation, complying with the following regulations‚Äîmust be 8 to 10 inches in height, be made of tan rough side out cattle hide leather with a plain toe and tan rubber outsoles, and be without zippers, metal cleats, or side tabs. The Mountain Combat Boot is available for difficult terrain, and the Extreme Cold Vapor Barrier Boots for cold weather. As with the T-shirt, coyote brown boots are authorized with ACU-OCP and will become the sole boot authorized following the completion of the transition in 2019.

Charibert II (607/617-8 April 632), a son of Clotaire II and his junior wife Sichilde, was briefly King of Aquitaine from 629 to his death, with his capital at Toulouse. We have no direct statement about when Charibert was born exactly, only that he was \\"a few years younger\\" than his half-brother Dagobert.Jean Charles L√©onard de Sismondi, The French under the Merovingians (1850), pp. 152‚Äì54. His father Clotaire evidently had a bigamous marriage (not then uncommon) and he was the offspring of the junior wife. When his father, Clotaire II, King of the Franks, died in 629, Charibert made a bid for the kingdom of Neustria against his elder half-brother Dagobert I, who had already been king of Austrasia since 623. In the ensuing negotiations, Charibert, a minor, was represented by his uncle Brodulf, the brother of Queen Sichilde. Dagobert had Brodulf killed, but did not intercede when his half-brother took over the near-independent realm of Aquitaine. Apparently this caused no disagreement, as in 631 Charibert stood godfather to Dagobert's son Sigebert. Charibert's realm included Toulouse, Cahors, Agen, P√©rigueux, and Saintes, to which he added his possessions in Gascony. Charibert was married to Gisela, the daughter of Amand, Ruler of the Gascons. His fighting force subdued the resistance of the Basques, until the whole Novempopulania (become Duchy of Vasconia) was under his control. In 632, Charibert died at Blaye, Gironde-- possibly assassinated on Dagobert's orders--and soon after that Charibert's infant son Chilperic was also killed. Aquitaine passed again to Dagobert. Both Charibert and his son are buried in the early Romanesque Basilica of Saint- Romain at Blaye. Notes Sources ;Primary *Fredegar. 1960.

Flumes are not to be confused with aqueducts, which are built to transport water, rather than transporting materials using flowing water as a flume does. Flumes route water from a diversion dam or weir to a desired materiel collection location.Flumes are usually made up of wood, metal or concrete. Many flumes took the form of wooden troughs elevated on trestles, often following the natural contours of the land. Originating as a part of a mill race, they were later used in the transportation of logs in the logging industry, known as a log flume. They were also extensively used in hydraulic mining and working placer deposits for gold, tin and other heavy minerals. Etymology The term flume comes from the Old French word flum, from the Latin flumen, meaning a river. It was formerly used for a stream, and particularly for the tail of a mill race. It is used in America for a very narrow gorge running between precipitous rocks, with a stream at the bottom, but more frequently is applied to an artificial channel of wood or other material for the diversion of a stream of water from a river for purposes of irrigation, for running a sawmill, or for various processes in the hydraulic method of gold-mining. Types of flumes Bull Run Hydroelectric Project diversion flume, carrying water from one reservoir to another. Working irrigation flume under repair in the East Kootenay, British Columbia Canada. Built in 1912, it runs 8km to provide water to a few dozen farms. =Millrace= A diversionary flume is used to transfer water from one body to another, such as between two reservoirs. =Log flume= Log flumes use the flow of water to carry cut logs and timber downhill, sometimes many miles, to either a sawmill or location for further transport. =Flow measurement flume= Measuring flume in the UK Flume outflow A temporary flume in New South Wales Some varieties of flumes are used in measuring water flow of a larger channel. When used to measure the flow of water in open channels, a flume is defined as a specially shaped, fixed hydraulic structure that under free-flow conditions forces flow to accelerate in such a manner that the flow rate through the flume can be characterized by a level-to-flow relationship as applied to a single head (level) measurement within the flume. Acceleration is accomplished through a convergence of the sidewalls, a change in floor elevation, or a combination of the two.Flumes, Openchannelflow.com Flow measurement flumes typically consist of a converging section, a throat section, and a diverging section. Not all sections, however, need to be present. In the case of the Cutthroat flume, the converging section directly joins the diverging section, resulting in a throat section of no length (hence the term \\"Cutthroat\\"). Other flumes omit the diverging section (Montana, USGS Portable Parshall, and HS / H / HL flumes).Sections of a Flume - Their Location and Function, Openchannelflow.com Flumes offer distinct advantages over sharp-crested weirs: *For the same control width, the head loss for a flume is about one-fourth of that needed to operate a sharp-crested weir *The velocity of approach is part of the calibration equations for flumes *Unauthorized altering of the dimensions of constructed flumes is difficult (and therefore unlikely) *Most flume styles readily allow for the passage of sedimentation and floating debris ‚Äì reducing the time and effort associated with maintaining a flume installation Styles of flow measurement flumes include: Cutthroat, HS / H / HL-type, Khafagi, Montana, RBC, Parshall, Palmer- Bowlus, Trapezoidal, and Venturi Flume. Flow measurement flumes can be installed in earthen channels, concrete canals, below ground chambers, or factory integrated into Packaged Metering Manholes. =Navigable canal flume= A bypass flume on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal In some nineteenth- century canals, a bypass flume diverted water around a lift lock from the level (or pound) above to the level below the lock, so that the level below would have sufficient water. p. 270 =Recreational flumes= In competitive swimming, specialized flumes with transparent sides are often employed by coaches to analyze a swimmer's technique. The speed of the flow is variable to accommodate the full spectrum of swimming styles and ability.

The definition varies slightly among different jurisdictions, but the transfer of a controlled substance alone usually does not constitute a diversion, since certain controlled substances that are prescribed to a child are intended to be administered by an adult, as directed by a medical professional. The term comes from the \\"diverting\\" of the drugs from their original licit medical purpose. In some jurisdictions, drug diversion programs are available to first time offenders of diversion drug laws, which \\"divert\\" offenders from the criminal justice system to a program of education and rehabilitation. Commonly diverted drugs Z-drug example Controlled prescription drug classes which are commonly diverted include: *Benzodiazepines ‚Äì including diazepam, temazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam ‚Äì prescription anxiolytics and sedatives *Opioids ‚Äì including morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone and codeine ‚Äì prescription pain medications *Stimulants ‚Äì amphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil ‚Äì prescribed to treat ADHD and narcolepsy *Z-drugs ‚Äì including zolpidem (Ambien), Eszopiclone (Lunesta) ‚Äì prescription sleep medications According to the United States Department of Justice, \\"Most pharmaceuticals abused in the United States are diverted by doctor shopping, forged prescriptions, theft and, increasingly, via the Internet.\\"US Department of Justice web site To reduce the occurrence of pharmaceutical diversion by doctor shopping and prescription fraud, almost all states have established prescription monitoring programs (PMPs) that facilitate the collection, analysis, and reporting of information regarding pharmaceutical drug prescriptions.  Registration of drug suppliers  21 U.S.C. ¬ß 823 of the Controlled Substances Act provides for registration of manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances. The criteria for registering manufacturers of Schedule I and II drugs are particularly strict and call for \\"limiting the importation and bulk manufacture of such controlled substances to a number of establishments which can produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes.\\" The Attorney General must make a positive determination that the registration would be \\"consistent with the public interest.\\" For manufacturers of other drugs, and for drug distributors, the regulations are substantially less strict: \\"The Attorney General shall register an applicant‚Ä¶ unless he determines that the issuance of such registration is inconsistent with the public interest.\\" The criteria for both manufacture and distribution is somewhat biased in favor of established industries, favoring \\"past experience\\" and a record of compliance with drug laws The Controlled Substances Act also provides for the registration of medical practitioners (i.e., physicians, dentists, veterinarians, etc.), pharmacies and hospitals that prescribe, administer, or dispense controlled substances directly to patients, as well as individuals conducting approved research involving controlled substances. This category also includes narcotic treatment programs that administer and dispense primarily methadone for narcotic addiction treatment. = Examples = This activity can occur in many venues: The Cincinnati Post has reported on its frequency. John Burke, an expert on the issue, was quoted as saying, \\"Pharmaceutical diversion is kind of funny because it's going on in every community, but it appears not to exist unless you go after it purposely.\\" DEA investigation into oxycodone diversion According to the US Justice Department, in 2011 CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Florida, ordered enough painkillers to supply a population eight times its size. Sanford has a population of 53,000 but the supply would support 400,000. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), in 2010 a single CVS pharmacy in Sanford ordered 1.8 million oxycodone pills, an average of 137,994 pills a month. Other pharmacy customers in Florida averaged 5,364 oxycodone pills a month. DEA investigators serving a warrant to a CVS pharmacy in Sanford on October 18, 2011 noted that \\"approximately every third car that came through the drive-thru lane had prescriptions for oxycodone or hydrocodone.\\" According to the DEA, a pharmacist at that location stated to investigators that \\"her customers often requested certain brands of oxycodone using street slang,\\" an indicator that the drugs were being diverted and not used for legitimate pain management. In response, CVS in a statement issued February 17 in response to opioid trafficking questions from USA Today said the company is committed to working with the DEA and had taken \\"significant actions to ensure appropriate dispensing of painkillers in Florida.\\" In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration‚Äôs Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal Health's supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him ‚Äúit made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say‚Äù. Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015. Cardinal was never fined. Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino's \\"Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act\\". The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016., 114th Cong. (2015).

It is part of the Foothill‚ÄìDe Anza Community College District. It was founded on January 15, 1957 by Founding Superintendent and President Dr. Calvin C. Flint. The college offers 79 Associate degree programs, 1 Bachelor's degree program, and 107 certificate programs. History In July 1956, Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Henry M. Gunn called a meeting of local school superintendents that led to the creation of Foothill College.Roberta Couch, Tom Jamison, Doug Stine, Susan Johnston, Rene Lynch, and Judy Sisk, Foothill College: 25 Years (Los Altos Hills: Foothill College, 1981), 10. Calvin Flint, then President of Monterey Peninsula College, was hired as the first District Superintendent and President; he started work on March 1, 1958.Couch, 10. Candidates for the new college's name, besides Foothill, were Peninsula, Junipero Serra, Mid-Peninsula, Earl Warren, Herbert Hoover, North Santa Clara, Altos, Valley, Skyline, Highland, and Intercity.Couch, 11. At first the name was Foothill Junior College, but because Flint insisted that his new college would be \\"not junior to anyone\\", the Board dropped the \\"Junior\\" in September 1958. Foothill held its first classes in the old Highway School campus on El Camino Real in Mountain View on September 15, 1958. It was accredited by March of the next year and was the first school in the state to ever reach full accreditation in less than six months. The owl mascot originated from a concrete owl that was a decoration on the Highway School's bell tower; it was later moved to the new campus.Couch, 130. Example of Foothill's campus architecture The campus was designed by architect Ernest Kump and landscape architects Hideo Sasaki and Peter Walker,Raver, Anne. \\"Hideo Sasaki, 80, Influential Landscape Architect, Dies.\\" The New York Times, September 25, 2000, sec.

The Foothill College was intended as a junior college for 3,500 full-time students, within the 122-acre campus, the first of many junior colleges built after World War II in California. Soon after its completion, Foothill was widely recognized as a pioneer, setting high standards for new campus design.Peter Walker: landscape as art. No. 85. Process Architecture, 1989. Traditionally, Foothill serves the communities of Los Altos Hills, Los Altos, Mountain View, and Palo Alto; together these communities form the northwest corner of Silicon Valley. The college sits next to Interstate 280, at the interchange with El Monte Road. In 1993, Foothill and its sister school De Anza College became the first California Community Colleges to offer Domestic Partner benefits. The colleges were among a very small number of institutions of higher education to do so, with Pitzer College and the University of Iowa in 1991 and Stanford and the University of Chicago in 1992. In 2003, to accommodate nearly 14,000 students on a campus designed for 3,500, the college began renovating almost the entire campus, including demolition and replacement of unsafe buildings. Two of the new buildings in the lower campus complex have green roofs topped with grass. In 2002, a second campus was opened on the site of the former Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, in facilities leased from the Palo Alto School District. In September 2016, this was replaced by the Sunnyvale Center, which the college built on part of the site of the now closed Onizuka Air Force Station, preserving artefacts from the \\"Blue Cube\\" and embedding shards of its skin in walkways. The new center can accommodate more than 1,600 students. Accreditation Foothill College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community & Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. This organization is recognized by the Council on Higher Education Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education. Foothill is also accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association, American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation, American Medical Association Council on Medical Education, and Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs.

The museum was established with the help of the Douglas Perham Electronic Foundation, which wanted a permanent home for its extensive electronics collection, including papers of the inventor of the vacuum tube amplifier, Lee de Forest. The foundation raised money to construct a museum building on the Foothill campus and donated its collection to the college. The museum opened in 1973, and was initially operated by employees of Foothill College for six years until 1979, just after the passage of Proposition 13 rolled back property taxes and reduced funds to run the college. In response to the funding shortage, volunteers began staffing the museum. However, in 1988, the college board of trustees decided to close the museum, sell or donate the assets, and use the space for classrooms. A newly appointed Perham board member, Bart Lee, took on the case and sued Foothill, claiming the college violated an agreement with the Perham Foundation. The foundation was eventually awarded $775,000, which they used to document, pack up, and place the collection in storage before a 1991 deadline. The collection stayed in storage for twelve years, before being acquired in 2003 by History San Jos√© and put on display as The Perham Collection of Early Electronics.

Taxonomy The Syrian woodpecker was first described as Picus syriacus by Wilhelm Hemprich and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1833, from a specimen collected on Mount Lebanon. Distribution and habitat The woodpecker is a resident breeding bird from southeastern Europe east to Iran. Its range has expanded further northwest into Europe in recent years. It is an inhabitant of open woodlands, cultivation with trees and scrubs, and parks, depending for food and nesting sites upon old trees. It is often an inconspicuous bird, in spite of the plumage. Description The woodpecker is 23 cm long, and is very similar to the great spotted woodpecker, Dendrocopos major. The upper parts of the male are glossy black, with a crimson spot on the nape and white on the forehead, sides of the face and neck. On the shoulder is a large white patch and the flight feathers are black with white spots forming three wingbars. The three outer tail feathers show only a few white spots; these show when the short stiff tail is outspread, acting as a support in climbing. The under parts are buffish white, the abdomen and under tail coverts reddish. The long bill is slate black and the legs greenish grey. The female has no crimson on the nape, and in the young this nape spot is absent, but the crown is crimson. It differs from the smaller lesser spotted woodpecker by the crimson on the abdomen. It is much harder to distinguish Syrian woodpecker from great spotted woodpecker. Syrian has a longer bill, has more white on the head, and lacks the white tail barring of great spotted. Behaviour Tree with a Syrian woodpecker's hole. =Communication= When hidden by the foliage, the Syrian woodpecker's presence is often advertised by the mechanical drumming, a vibrating rattle, produced by the rapidly repeated blows of its strong bill upon a trunk or branch. This is not merely a mating call or challenge, but a signal of either sex. It is audible from a great distance, depending on the wind and the condition of the wood, and a hollow bough naturally produces a louder note than living wood. The drumming is longer than great spotted woodpecker's, and decreases in volume. It is faster and shorter than the drumming of white-backed woodpecker. The call is a sharp quit, quit, softer than great spotted woodpecker, and something like common redshank. =Feeding= The Syrian woodpecker's food mainly consists of those insects which bore into the timber of forest trees, such as the larvae of wood boring moths and beetles. Additional prey includes bees such as Xylocopa pubescens.Gerling, Dan, Paul David Hurd, and Abraham Hefetz. Comparative behavioral biology of two Middle East species of carpenter bees (Xylocopa Latreille)(Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Smithsonian Institution Press, 1983. The woodpecker usually alights on the trunk, working upwards. During the ascent it taps the bark, breaking off fragments, but often extracts its prey from crevices with the tip of its sticky tongue. Seeds, nuts and berries are eaten when insect food is scarce. Its actions are jerky, and it hops rather than climbs, leaping forward with one foot just in advance of the other. Usually feeding in a vertically 'heads-up\\" position , it is not uncommon for the woodpecker to assume a vertically or horizontally upside-down attitude while probing a tree for food. When a space is crossed the flight is easy and undulating. Matured chick of a Syrian woodpecker, peeking out of its nesting hole =Breeding= The neat, round 5 cm diameter nesting hole, is bored in soft or decaying wood horizontally for a few inches, then perpendicularly down. At the bottom of the shaft, a small chamber is excavated, where up to 11 creamy white eggs are laid on wood chips. The hole is rarely used again, but not infrequently other holes are bored in the same tree. Almost any tree sufficiently rotten is used. The young, when the parents are feeding them, cluster at the mouth of the hole and keep a continuous chatter, but when alarmed slip back into the hole.

While he taught his students about Nazi Germany during his \\"Contemporary World History\\" class, Jones found it difficult to explain how the German people could accept the actions of the Nazis, and decided to create a social movement as a demonstration of the appeal of fascism. Over the course of five days, Jones ‚Äì a member of the SDS, Cubberley United Student Movement sponsor and Black Panthers supporter ‚Äì conducted a series of exercises in his classroom emphasizing discipline and community, intended to model certain characteristics of the Nazi movement. As the movement grew outside his class and began to number in the hundreds, Jones began to feel that the movement had spiraled out of control. He convinced the students to attend a rally where he claimed that the classroom project was part of a nationwide movement, and that the announcement of a Third Wave presidential candidate would be televised. Upon their arrival, the students were presented with a blank channel. Jones told his students of the true nature of the movement as an experiment in fascism, and presented to them a short film discussing the actions of Nazi Germany., and Background to the Third Wave experiment The experiment took place at Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California, during the first week of April 1967. Jones, finding himself unable to explain to his students how the German population could have claimed ignorance of The Holocaust, decided to demonstrate it to them instead. Jones started a movement called \\"The Third Wave\\" and told his students that the movement aimed to eliminate democracy. The idea that democracy emphasises individuality was considered as a drawback, and Jones emphasised this main point of the movement in its motto: \\"Strength through discipline, strength through community, strength through action, strength through pride.\\" The experiment was not well documented at the time. Of contemporary sources, the experiment is only mentioned in the Cubberley High School student newspaper, The Cubberley Catamount. It is only briefly mentioned in two issues, and one more issue of the paper has a longer article about this experiment at its conclusion. Jones himself wrote a detailed account of the experiment some nine years afterward and more articles about the experiment followed, including some interviews with Jones and the original students. Chronology =First day= Ron Jones writes that he started the first day of the experiment with simple things such as proper seating and extensively drilling the students (who were in their senior year of school). He then proceeded to enforce strict classroom discipline by emerging as an authoritarian figure and dramatically improving the efficiency of the class. The first day's session was closed with only a few rules, being rather simple and intending to be a one-day experiment. Students had to be sitting at attention before the second bell, had to stand up to ask or answer questions and had to do it in three words or fewer, and were required to preface each remark with \\"Mr. Jones\\". =Second day= On the second day, he managed to meld his history class into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community. Jones based the name of his movement, \\"The Third Wave\\", on the supposed fact that the third in a series of waves is the strongest. Jones created a salute involving a cupped hand reaching across the chest toward the opposite shoulder resembling a Hitler salute, and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class. They all complied with this command. =Third day= The experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in: some students who did not take the history class but had a free period decided to join the class. On the third day, the class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees. All of the students showed drastic improvement in their academic skills and tremendous motivation. All of the students were issued a member card, and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or the like. Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants. Jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules. =Fourth day= On the fourth day of the experiment, Jones decided to terminate the movement because it was slipping out of his control. The students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was outstanding. He announced to the participants that this movement was a part of a nationwide movement and that on the next day a presidential candidate of the Third Wave would publicly announce its existence. Jones ordered students to attend a noon rally on Friday to witness the announcement. =Fifth and last day= Instead of a televised address of their leader, the students were presented with an empty channel. After a few minutes of waiting, Jones announced that they had been a part of an experiment in fascism and that they all willingly created a sense of superiority like German citizens had in the period of Nazi Germany. He then played them a film about the Nazi regime to conclude the experiment. Aftermath On October 10, 2010, the documentary, Lesson Plan, which retold the story of the Third Wave through interviews with the original students and teacher, debuted at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It was produced by Philip Neel, one of Jones's own former students. =Dramatizations= * The events of the experiment were adapted into a 1981 US TV special, The Wave. This formed the basis for the Young Adult novelization of the same name by Todd Strasser, who conducted the story of the Third Wave into a modern time period, who used the pen name Morton Rhue in Europe. * It Can't Happen Here, the 86th book in the Sweet Valley Twins series, features a substitute teacher who conducts an experiment very similar in nature to The Third Wave. * In 2001, a musical adaptation written by Olaf Pyttlik premiered at the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre in Canada. * The 2008 German film Die Welle transferred the experiment to a modern-day German classroom. The film received critical acclaim. * \\"The Pride of Lakewood\\", a 2010 episode of children's animated series Arthur, was loosely based on the Third Wave experiment. In it, students who form a community pride group become fascistic. * In 2010, Jones staged a musical called The Wave, written with some of the students in the class. * The events were adapted into a straight play version in 2011 by Joseph Robinette and Ron Jones. * The German-language miniseries We Are the Wave (2019) is based on the book by Strasser.

It is the narrative description of a project's work requirement. It defines project-specific activities, deliverables and timelines for a vendor providing services to the client. The SOW typically also includes detailed requirements and pricing, with standard regulatory and governance terms and conditions. It is often an important accompaniment to a master service agreement or request for proposal (RFP).  Overview  Many formats and styles of statement of work document templates have been specialized for the hardware or software solutions described in the request for proposal. Many companies create their own customized version of SOWs that are specialized or generalized to accommodate typical requests and proposals they receive. However, it is usually informed by the goals of the top management as well as input from the customer and/or user groups. Note that in many cases the statement of work is a binding contract. Master service agreements or consultant/training service agreements postpone certain work- specific contractual components that are addressed in individual statements of work. The master service agreement serves as a master contract governing the terms over potentially multiple SOWs. Sometimes it refers to scope of work. For instance, if a project is done on contract, the scope statement included as part of it can be used as the SOW since it also outlines the work of the project in clear and concise terms.  Areas addressed  A statement of work typically addresses these subjects. * Purpose: Why are we doing this project? A purpose statement attempts to answer this. * Scope of work: This describes the work to be done and specifies the hardware and software involved. The definition of scope becomes the scope statement. * Location of work: This describes where the work is to be performed, including the location of hardware and software and where people will meet to do the work. * Period of performance: This specifies the allowable time for projects, such as start and finish time, number of hours that can be billed per week or month, where work is to be performed and anything else that relates to scheduling. * Deliverables schedule: This part lists and describes what is due and when. * Applicable standards: This describes any industry specific standards that need to be adhered to in fulfilling the contract. * Acceptance criteria: This specifies how the buyer or receiver of goods will determine if the product or service is acceptable, usually with objective criteria. See Acceptance testing. * Special requirements: This specifies any special hardware or software, specialized workforce requirements, such as degrees or certifications for personnel, travel requirements, and anything else not covered in the contract specifics. * Type of contract/payment schedule: The project acceptance will depend on if the budget available will be enough to cover the work required. Therefore, a breakdown of payments by whether they are up-front or phased will usually be negotiated in an early stage. * Miscellaneous: Many items that are not part of the main negotiations may be listed because they are important to the project, and overlooking or forgetting them could pose problems for the project. United States government contracts For US government service contracts, the use of SOWs remains strong, although statements of objectives (SOOs) and performance work statements (PWSs) have become increasingly popular due to their emphasis on performance-based concepts such as desired service outcomes and performance standards. SOWs are typically used when the task is well-known and can be described in specific terms. They may be preferred when the government does not desire innovative approaches or considers any deviation in contractor processes a risk. SOOs establish high-level outcomes and objectives for performance and PWSs emphasize outcomes, desired results, and objectives at a more detailed and measurable level, whereas SOWs provide explicit statements of work direction for the contractor or offeror to follow. SOWs are typically replete with \\"contractor shall\\" statements of mandatory compliance (for example, \\"This task shall be performed in accordance with Agency xyz Directive, dated mm/dd/yyyy\\"). In practice, SOWs can also be found to contain references to desired performance outcomes, performance standards, and metrics, thus blurring their distinction between SOOs and PWSs. Aside from good practice, there is little government policy guidance that emphatically prescribes how and when to use SOWs versus SOOs or PWSs. Whereas the FAR defines PWS in Part 2 Definitions, and references SOOs and PWSs in Part 37.6 Performance Based Acquisition, SOWs are not addressed. SOWs are usually contained in the government's solicitation (RFP or RFQ) and carried forward, as may be negotiated with the offeror, into the final contract. In federal solicitations and contracts, SOWs are inserted into Section C \\"Descriptions/Specifications\\" of the Uniform Contract Format,See Uniform Contract Format, FAR 14.2 but may also be inserted as an attachment in Section J. In task orders, the SOW may simply be included among the terms and conditions of the order itself. The SOW is often supplemented by technical reference documents and attachments. In developing the SOW, it is important to ensure that the statement of work is comprehensive and sufficiently detailed, but that the statements do not duplicate terms and conditions or other provisions elsewhere in the solicitation or contract. Guidance in MIL-STD-881 and MIL-HDBK-245 says that a work breakdown structure should be used in developing the SOW. This may use the WBS as an outline, where each WBS element (in the same name and numbering) are the sub-parts of the SOW section 3, making the development easier and to improve later billing and tracking. The WBS which focuses on intelligently dividing a hierarchy of the work elements and defining them may then have the SOW in matching sections focus on describing what will be done with that portion or how that portion will be done. The statement of work should be directly linked to deliverables shown in the CDRL form. This is done by having each CDRL entry include reference to the SOW paragraph(s) that produces or uses the item, and the SOW text should be clear where it is discussing a deliverable by using the title or parenthesizing the item number (for example, \\"[A-001]\\").

It is not an academic honor society; a minimum Grade Point Average is only one of six criteria for admission, and Order of Omega is not a part of the Association of College Honor Societies.http://www.achsnatl.org/quick_link.asp  History  The Order of Omega was established in Fall 1959 at the University of Miami.The Red&Black; -March 29, 2016 - Order of Omega, Greek honors society, inducts 91 new members It sought to differentiate itself from the long-standing Greek honors society of Phi Beta Kappa by emphasizing community service and inter- Greek communication over academic and nominal honors. At that time, the group adopted as its mark the Greek letter omega, in gold on an ivory field. The organization was unique to the University of Miami until, in 1967, a second charter was granted to begin a chapter at University of Southern Mississippi. The group remained exclusive to men until 1977.McNeese Greek Life 2017-2018 p 7 In more recent years, the Order has emerged as a moot arena in which the Fraternity/Sorority community can air progressive changes to its member organizations as a whole; the 'dry' movement eschewing alcohol use among many groups drew a great deal of support from discussion in the early 1980s about how to improve the general reputation of the Fraternity/Sorority community. The stated purposes of the organization are:Beta Theta Pi Magazine - Winter 2006 - p 25 - Order of Omega * To recognize those fraternity men and women who have attained a high standard of leadership in interfraternity activities, to encourage them to continue along this line, and to inspire others to strive for similar conspicuous attainment; * To bring together outstanding fraternity men and women to create an organization which will help to mold the sentiment of the institution on questions of local and intercollegiate fraternity affairs. * To bring together members of the faculty, alumni, and student members of the institution's fraternities and sororities on a basis of mutual interest, understanding and helpfulness; * To help create an atmosphere where ideas and issues can be discussed openly across Greek lines and to help work out solutions. At present, the Order maintains over 550 chapters at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.  Standards and operation  The executive board of the individual Order of Omega chapter is empowered to make decisions concerning the merit of an applicant and initiate them into the Order based upon the following criteria: character, scholarship, offices held in Greek organizations, service to the Fraternity/Sorority community, and service to the university community as a whole. It requires upperclassman status (3rd or 4th year at most universities), full-time attendance as a student, and a GPA within the top 10% of the Fraternity/Sorority community at the campus in question. Order of Omega represents the top 3% within the Fraternity/Sorority community on each of its campuses.Kappa Alpha Journal Winter 2015-16 p 10 Much of most chapters' typical operation consists of charitable fundraisers, and the selection of persons to receive scholarships endowed by alumni. Persons are only eligible to be initiated into the Order as regular members if they are undergraduates in accredited colleges and universities, but are considered members for life, and some continue to support their chapters financially. Faculty, staff, alumni, and others may be elected as honoris causa members.

He was born in ≈Åuk√≥w (Poland) and immigrated to Brazil in the mid 19th century on a mission on behalf of King Louis-Philippe of France to Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil. Ostracised for their participation in the failed insurrection for the independence of Poland in 1830-31, Chernoviz, along with many other Polish students and professionals, requested political asylum in France. Chernoviz, who had initiated his medical studies at the Uniwersytet Warszawski, completed them at the Universit√© de Montpellier in 1838. In 1840, he emigrated to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and developed a very successful medical practice. He became a full member of the Imperial Academy of Medicine and was awarded the title of Cavaleiro da Ordem de Cristo (Knight of Christ's Order) and Oficial da Ordem da Rosa (Officer of the Rose's Order). In 1846, Chernoviz married Julie Bernard, a Brazilian of French descent, in Rio de Janeiro. The couple had six children. Although Chernoviz returned to France with his family in 1855, he remained active in the medical and scientific communities of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. While maintaining an active medical practice, Chernoviz wrote several medical and scientific books, intended for the layman, which became popular throughout Latin America. Some of the most noteworthy are: * Formul√°rio e Guia M√©dico (Prescription Vademecum and Medical Guide), first published by Edouard and Henri Laemmert in Rio de Janeiro in 1841, reprinted and re-edited numerous times until 1927. The first edition was a single volume with less than 1.000 pages; the second printing of the 19th edition in 1927 had two volumes and together more than 4.000 pages. * Diccion√°rio de Medicina Popular e das Ci√™ncias Acess√≥rias para Uso das Fam√≠lias (Popular Medicine and Complementary Sciences Dictionary for Family Use), in two volumes, I with 471 and II with 488 pages, also published in Rio de Janeiro in 1842/1843. The sixth and last edition in Portuguese was in 1890 also in two volumes with a total of more than 2.500 pages * Hist√≥ria Natural para Meninos e Meninas (Natural History for Boys and Girls), published in Paris in 1860. The sixth edition of the Diccion√°rio de Medicina Popular was initially translated into Spanish in 1894. Chernoviz's books were published in Rio de Janeiro by Edouard & Henri Laemmert, Brazilian-German publishers who represented many French authors and firms in Brazil. The 11th and subsequent editions of the Formul√°rio, and the 6th and subsequent editions of the Diccion√°rio were published in Paris by the firm of A. Roger & F. Chernoviz (the author's son, Fernando). The design, layout, style and illustrations of Chernoviz's books resembled those favored in Europe at the time. The medical books were beautifully illustrated with many high quality engravings. The texts included precise descriptions of human organs and their diseases, as well as descriptions of the medications deemed appropriate at the time for these ailments. The pharmacopoeia was not limited to that of mainstream European medicine but made extensive use of indigenous Brazilian remedies. Both the Formul√°rio e Guia Medico and the Diccion√°rio are frequently quoted today by ethno-biologists and medical researchers. Despite the popularity of Chernoviz's published work, little is known about his work methods: notes and record-keeping, filing system, data retrieval, updating of information, and so on, at a time when typewriters were just beginning to become a standard office appliance.

He directed eight distinct renditions of Hamlet. Ninagawa was also emeritus of the Toho Gakuen College of Drama and Music. Although most famous abroad for his touring productions of European classics, Ninagawa also directed works based on contemporary writing from Japan, including the Modern Noh plays of Yukio Mishima (which toured to New York's Lincoln Center in early summer 2005) and several other plays by Japanese dramatists, including Sh≈´ji Terayama and Kunio Shimizu. His production of Titus Andronicus was performed in England in June 2006, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford and the Theatre Royal in Plymouth. In 2007 his company participated in the Barbican International Theatre Event (BITE) series at the Barbican Arts Centre in London, with their production of Coriolanus.  Biography  In 1955 Ninagawa first joined theatre company \\"Seihai\\" (‚Äòyoung actors‚Äô). In 1967 he left the group and set up his own theatre company, \\"Gendaijin-Gekijo\\" (‚Äòmodern people's theatre‚Äô). He made his debut as a director in 1969 with Shinjo afururu keihakusa (‚Äògenuine frivolity‚Äô?). After the disbandment of ‚ÄúGendaijin-Gekijo‚Äù in 1971, in the following year he established a new theatre company called \\"Sakura-sha\\" ('cherry blossom company'), which once again resulted in disbandment three years later, 1974. At the same time, the year 1974 has become the turning point for Ninagawa, when the then Toho theatre producer Tadao Nakane invited him to direct big theatres, and as a result he came to work on a Shakespeare play for the very first time - Romeo and Juliet. Since then, he has become one of the most feted directors in the theatre world. He also often provides interesting topics such as launching the project in 1998 to direct all of Shakespeare's works, or in the year 2000 directing Greeks in which its performance lasted for a total of ten and a half hours. Beginning in 1983 when he directed Medea, Ninagawa continues to do overseas tours every year, which adds to his high reputation in Europe, United States and Canada. In recent years he has been invited to present a play each year in London, three years in a row ‚Äì Midsummer Night's Dream in 1996, Shintokumaru (name of the male protagonist) in 1997, and Hamlet in 1998. In addition he has collaborated with the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1999 to 2000 and presented King Lear at London and Stratford-upon-Avon. Ninagawa has won many awards in Japan, and also he has been awarded honorary doctorates in the UK by the University of Edinburgh (1992) and Plymouth University (2009). He is the father of the acclaimed photographer and film director Mika Ninagawa. In his theatrical company \\"Ninagawa Studio (Ninagawa Company)\\", he continues to produce experimental productions with young group members.

It is set to the tune of \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad.\\" Students, faculty, staff, and alumni of the University sing the song at Longhorn sports games, before the fireworks and other events. History The Eyes of Texas at a 250px The Eyes of Texas after a 250px John Sinclair wrote the Texas-specific song lyrics in 1903 to the tune of the original folk song, \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad,\\" that was published nine years earlier in 1894. Sinclair was the editor of the Cactus yearbook and a UT band member, and he wrote the lyrics per the request of band member Lewis Johnson. Johnson was also the program director of the Varsity Minstrel Show that raised funds for the university track team. He debuted the song at the minstrel show. The lyrics are said to be intended to poke fun at University President William Lambdin (Colonel) Prather. Prather had attended Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, whose president, Robert E. Lee, would frequently tell his students, \\"the eyes of the South are upon you.\\" Prather was known for including in his speeches a similar admonition, \\"The eyes of Texas are upon you,\\" meaning that the state of Texas was watching and expecting the students to go out and do great things. Prather enjoyed the song and promoted its usage. He died not long thereafter, and the song was played at his funeral. The song is sung at momentous occasions such as graduation and even solemn occasions such as funerals. Led by the Longhorn Marching Band, it was sung at the July 14, 2007, funeral of First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, an alumna of the University of Texas. When singing the song, participants generally raise their right arm with their hand making the Hook 'em Horns symbol of The University. A recording of \\"The Eyes of Texas\\" was played over the Rose Bowl public-address system when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills to win Super Bowl XXVII, while Madison Square Garden organist Ray Castoldi played it when the Houston Rockets defeated the New York Knicks in the seventh game of the 1994 NBA Finals to clinch Texas' first NBA championship. Highway rest stops through the state feature road signs stating that \\"The Eyes of Texas are upon You!\\" These signs feature a silhouette of a Texas Ranger, encouraging motorists to call 9-1-1 to report criminal activity. The Eyes of Texas was once the fight song of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). In 1920, UTEP was known as College of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of Texas (sometimes referred to as \\"Texas College of Mines,\\" or \\"TCM\\"). As a branch of the University of Texas, the song automatically became TCM's fight song. The university replaced it with Marty Robbins's \\"El Paso\\" in 1985. The Eyes of Texas is also sung at the graduation of University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). UTMB is the first, but not the only state medical school.  Lyrics  The wording of the song is as follows. As stated, the lyrics are set to the tune of \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad.\\" It is common practice that the last line, \\"Til Gabriel blows his horn,\\" is sung and played to a slightly slower beat than the rest of the song. Students, faculty, staff, athletes, and alum punctuate each beat of the last line with a small chopping motion of their right raised arm and \\"Hook 'Em\\" hand sign.  Controversy  In June 2020, several players on the University of Texas at Austin football team requested that the university replace the song with one \\"without racist undertones.\\" In response to the players request, African- American former University of Texas football players Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams spoke out to keep the song in place as UT's alma mater. Campbell's comments on the \\"Eyes of Texas\\" are as follows: Williams was also quoted as saying: Following those requests, interim UT president Jay Hartzell announced that the song would remain as the alma mater but that the university would work to \\"reclaim and redefine\\" the song by openly acknowledging its history.

He played at international level for Scotland, winning 77 caps, and at club level for Edinburgh, Perpignan, and Clermont Auvergne among others. He also played rugby league. Early life Hines was born in Wagga Wagga, NSW. He attended Berkeley Vale Community High School from 1989‚Äì1994 and was a regular feature in the school's first XIII rugby league team. He played his club football for the Berkeley Vale Panthers Junior Rugby League Club and was part of the club's first ever Premiership winning side (U/15s ‚Äì defeated Woy Woy in 1991) playing alongside future NRL player Paul Stringer. Hines attended Berkeley Vale Community High School, from 1989-94 with Stringer where they played in the first XIII together. This is the same school that produced Wallaby star Adam Ashley-Cooper and Olympic marathon runner and City to Surf winner Martin Dent. Hines was also part of the Premiership winning Ourimbah Razorbacks U/19s Rugby Union side, the same club where Ashley-Cooper also played. Club career Hines won league and cup titles with Gala RFC, before signing for Edinburgh. He moved from Edinburgh to Perpignan in the 2005 off season. His time at Perpignan came to an end due to his refusal to play for them in the latter stages of the Top 14 to tour South Africa with the British and Irish Lions. On the Lions tour, Hines played in five regional matches, but was never selected for any of the Tests against South Africa. On 4 July 2009, it was reported in the French media that Hines would be joining 2008‚Äì09 Heineken Cup winners Leinster for the 2009‚Äì10 season. Hines became a regular starter and a crowd favourite for Leinster, he won the 2010‚Äì11 Heineken Cup with the Irish province. Hines signed for Clermont Auvergne in 2011. On 20 January 2014, Hines signed for Sale Sharks to compete in the English Aviva Premiership on a two-year contract from the 2014‚Äì15 season. International career In 2000, Hines made his Test debut for Scotland in New Zealand but two serious injuries claimed nearly 18 months of his career. He qualified to play for Scotland through his grandfather George Nairne who was from Govan. He became the first Scotland player to be sent off in a Test match when he was dismissed against the USA Eagles in 2002 for punching replacement hooker/flanker Dan Anderson. He was a big part of the Scotland squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, which was held in his country of birth. In the 2005 Six Nations Championship game against Wales at Murrayfield on 13 March, Hines came on in the second half and helped restore some pride, but his try was disallowed for lack of grounding. He was alleged to be discontented with the Scotland coaches (Matt Williams and Willie Anderson) and declared his retirement from international rugby. However, with the firing of the previous coaching regime and the appointment of his previous club coach, Frank Hadden, as Scotland coach, Hines returned to the squad. He made his reappearance as a substitute in the 2006 Six Nations win over England at Murrayfield. Hines toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009 and featured heavily in the midweek matches but did not participate in the Tests. On 9 November 2011 Hines announced his retirement from international rugby with immediate effect. This meant he started and ended his Scotland career at Eden Park, Auckland. Hines won a total of 77 caps and scored two tries (10 points). Coaching career On 6 May 2015, Hines joined the Scotland coaching staff as a Resource Coach, reuniting with his former coach Vern Cotter.

As a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, the State Government was first formed in 1851 when Victoria first gained the right to responsible government. Since the federation of Australia in 1901, Victoria has been a state, to which the Constitution of Australia regulates its relationship with the Australian Government. Under the Constitution, all states ceded legislative and judicial supremacy to the federal government but retain powers in matters not in conflict with federal law. The Victoria State Government enforces acts of Parliament passed by the Parliament of Victoria through government departments, statutory authorities, and other public agencies. The Government is formally presided over by the Governor of Victoria, who exercises their executive authority granted by the Constitution of Victoria through the Executive Council, a body consisting of senior cabinet ministers. In reality, both the governor and the Executive Council are largely ceremonial, with the premier and ministers having most authority over policy, appointments, and other executive orders made by the Governor-in-Council. The current head of government is Premier Daniel Andrews of the Labor Party, and the current head of state is Governor Linda Dessau. Executive branch Government in Victoria operates under the principles of the Westminster system as adapted in the Australian Constitution and of responsible government. Both systems and principles of governance have developed out of the United Kingdom, to which Victoria was previously a colony. Executive power rests formally with the Executive Council, which consists of the governor and senior ministers. In practice, executive power is exercised by the premier, appointed by the governor, provided they can command the support of a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly. The Cabinet is the de facto chief policy making organ and consists of the premier and all ministers. Legislative branch Legislative power rests with the Parliament of Victoria, which consists of Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, represented by the Governor of Victoria, and the two Houses, the Victorian Legislative Council (the upper house) and the Victorian Legislative Assembly (the lower house). Judicial power Judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court of Victoria and a system of subordinate courts, but the High Court of Australia and other federal courts have overriding jurisdiction on matters which fall under the ambit of the Australian Constitution. First Peoples' Assembly In November 2019, the First People's Assembly (FPA) was elected, consisting of 21 members representing Aboriginal Victorians, elected from five different regions in the state, and 10 members to represent each of the state's formally recognised traditional owner corporations, excluding the Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation, who declined to participate in the election process. The main aim of the Assembly is to work out the rules by which individual treaties will be negotiated between the Victoria State Government and individual Aboriginal peoples. It will also establish an independent \\"umpire\\", the Treaty Authority, to oversee the negotiations between the Aboriginal groups and the Victoria State Government and ensure fairness. It will also establish a fund to help negotiations are take place on an even financial footing among the various groups, and debate and decide which ideas, laws, policies and rights will be the subject of treaty negotiations. The Assembly meets Upper House, seat of the Legislative Assembly. It met for the first time on 10 December 2019, and again met over two days in February 2020. The Assembly hopes to agree upon a framework, umpire and process before November 2022, the date of the next state election. The current Labor government under Daniel Andrews is supportive, but the Coalition had not made a clear commitment to supporting the treaty process. On 11 July 2020, the Victoria State Government announced that it would establish a truth and reconciliation commission for Aboriginal Australians in Victoria, the first ever in Australia, with the terms of reference to be worked out collaboratively. The 21 elected members of the Assembly would consult with their communities and work with the Victoria State Government to design the process. The announcement was welcomed by the community. The 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart recommended that such a commission should be established across all of Australia. On 3 August 2020, the FPA held its first official negotiation meeting with Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gabrielle Williams.

He was a pupil of Torricelli and a disciple of Galileo.\\"Viviani\\" article in the University of St Andrews Biography Born and raised in Florence, Viviani studied at a Jesuit school. There, Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici furnished him a scholarship to purchase mathematical books. He became a pupil of Evangelista Torricelli and worked on physics and geometry. In 1639, at the age of 17, he was an assistant of Galileo Galilei in Arcetri. He remained a disciple until Galileo's death in 1642. From 1655 to 1656, Viviani edited the first edition of Galileo's collected works. After Torricelli's 1647 death, Viviani was appointed to fill his position at the Accademia dell'Arte del Disegno in Florence. Viviani was also one of the first members of the Grand Duke's experimental academy, the Accademia del Cimento, when it was created a decade later. In 1660, Viviani and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli conducted an experiment to determine the speed of sound. Timing the difference between the seeing the flash and hearing the sound of a cannon shot at a distance, they calculated a value of 350 meters per second (m/s), considerably better than the previous value of 478 m/s obtained by Pierre Gassendi. The currently accepted value is 331.29 m/s at 0 ¬∞C or 340.29 m/s at sea level. It has also been claimed that in 1661 he experimented with the rotation of pendulums, 190 years before the famous demonstration by Foucault. By 1666, Viviani started to receive many job offers as his reputation as a mathematician grew. That same year, Louis XIV of France offered him a position at the Acad√©mie Royale and John II Casimir of Poland offered Viviani a post as his astronomer. Fearful of losing Viviani, the Grand Duke appointed him court mathematician. Viviani accepted this post and turned down his other offers. In 1687, he published a book on engineering, Discorso intorno al difendersi da' riempimenti e dalle corrosione de' fiumi. Upon his death, Viviani left an almost completed work on the resistance of solids, which was subsequently completed and published by Luigi Guido Grandi. In 1737, the Church finally allowed Galileo to be reburied in a grave with an elaborate monument. The monument that was created in the church of Santa Croce was constructed with the help of funds left by Viviani for that specific purpose. Viviani's own remains were moved to Galileo's new grave as well. The lunar crater Viviani is named after him. Inscriptions The \\"Palazzo Viviani\\" or \\"Palazzo dei Cartelloni\\" with plaques and bust dedicated by Viviani to Galilei In Florence, Viviani had Galileo's life and achievements written in Latin on the fa√ßade of his palace, on huge stone scrolls.

It is also sometimes called the eczema-thrombocytopenia-immunodeficiency syndrome in keeping with Aldrich's original description in 1954. The WAS-related disorders of X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) and X-linked congenital neutropenia (XLN) may present similar but less severe symptoms and are caused by mutations of the same gene. Signs and symptoms WAS occurs most often in males due to its X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, affecting between 1 and 10 males per million. The first signs are usually petechiae and bruising, resulting from a low platelet count (i.e. thrombocytopenia). Spontaneous nose bleeds and bloody diarrhea are also common and eczema typically develops within the first month of life. Recurrent bacterial infections develop by three months. The majority of children with WAS develop at least one autoimmune disorder, and cancers (mainly lymphoma and leukemia) develop in up to a third of patients. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels are reduced, IgA and IgE are elevated, and IgG levels can be normal, reduced, or elevated. In addition to thrombocytopenia, WAS patients have abnormally small platelets (i.e. microthrombocytes) and ~30% also have elevated eosinophil counts (i.e. eosinophilia). Pathophysiology The microthrombocytes seen in WAS patients have only been observed in one other condition, ARPC1B deficiency. In both conditions the defective platelets are thought to be removed from circulation by the spleen and/or liver, leading to low platelet counts. WAS patients have increased susceptibility to infections, particularly of the ears and sinuses, and this immune deficiency has been linked to decreased antibody production and the inability of immune T cells to effectively combat infection. = Genetics = Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome has an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. WAS is associated with mutations in a gene on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.23) that was originally termed the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein gene and is officially known as WAS (Gene ID: 7454). X-linked thrombocytopenia is also linked to WAS mutations, although they differ from those that cause full-blown WAS. The rare disorder X-linked neutropenia has also been linked to a specific subset of WAS mutations. The protein product of WAS is known as WASp. It contains 502 amino acids and is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells (the cells in the bone marrow that develop into blood cells). The main function of WASp is to activate actin polymerization by serving as a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) for the Arp2/3 complex, which generates branched actin filaments. Several proteins can serve as NPFs, and it has been observed that in WAS platelets the Arp2/3 complex functions normally, indicating that WASp is not required for its activation in platelets. In T-cells, WASp is important because it is known to be activated via T-cell receptor signaling pathways to induce cortical actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that are responsible for forming the immunological synapse. The severity of the symptoms produced by WAS mutations correlates with their effects on WASp. Alleles that produce no or truncated protein have more severe effects than missense mutations. Although autoimmune disease and malignancy may occur with both types of mutations, patients with truncated WASp carry a higher risk. A defect in the CD43 molecule has also been found in WAS patients. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical parameters, the peripheral blood smear, and low immunoglobulin levels. Typically, IgM levels are low, IgA levels are elevated, and IgE levels may be elevated; paraproteins are occasionally observed. Skin immunologic testing (allergy testing) may reveal hyposensitivity. Not all patients have a positive family history of the disorder; new mutations do occur. Often, leukemia may be suspected on the basis of low platelets and infections, and bone marrow biopsy may be performed. Decreased levels of WASp are typically observed. The current gold standard for diagnosis is genomic DNA sequence analysis, which can detect WAS and the related disorders XLT and XLN in the vast majority of patients and carriers. =Classification= Jin et al. (2004) employ a numerical grading of severity: * 0.5: intermittent thrombocytopenia * 1.0: thrombocytopenia and small platelets (microthrombocytopenia) * 2.0: microthrombocytopenia plus normally responsive eczema or occasional upper respiratory tract infections * 2.5: microthrombocytopenia plus therapy-responsive but severe eczema or airway infections requiring antibiotics * 3.0: microthrombocytopenia plus both eczema and airway infections requiring antibiotics * 4.0: microthrombocytopenia plus eczema continuously requiring therapy and/or severe or life-threatening infections * 5.0: microthrombocytopenia plus autoimmune disease or malignancy Treatment Treatment of Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome is currently based on correcting symptoms. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided, since these may interfere with platelet function which is already compromised. A protective helmet can protect children from bleeding into the brain which could result from head injuries. For severely low platelet counts, patients may require platelet transfusions or removal of the spleen. For patients with frequent infections, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) can be given to boost the immune system. Anemia from bleeding may require iron supplementation or blood transfusion. As WAS is primarily a disorder of the blood-forming tissues, a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, accomplished through an umbilical cord blood or bone marrow transplant offers the only current hope of cure. This may be recommended for patients with HLA- identical donors, matched sibling donors, or even in cases of incomplete matches if the patient is age 5 or under. Studies of correcting Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome with gene therapy using a lentivirus have begun. Proof-of-principle for successful hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy has been provided for patients with Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome. Currently, many investigators continue to develop optimized gene therapy vectors. In July 2013 the Italian San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (HSR-TIGET) reported that three children with Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome showed significant improvement 20‚Äì30 months after being treated with a genetically modified lentivirus. In April 2015 results from a follow-up British and French trial where six children with Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome were treated with gene therapy were described as promising.Gallagher, James (21 April 2015) Gene therapy: 'Tame HIV' used to cure disease BBC News, Health, Retrieved 21 April 2015 Median follow-up time was 27 months. Epidemiology The estimated incidence of Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome in the United States is one in 250,000 live male births. No geographical factor is present.Robert A Schwartz, MD, MPH; Chief Editor: Harumi Jyonouchi, MD. Pediatric Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome History The syndrome is named after Dr. Alfred Wiskott (1898‚Äì1978), a German pediatrician who first noticed the syndrome in 1937, and Dr. Robert Anderson Aldrich (1917‚Äì1998), an American pediatrician who described the disease in a family of Dutch-Americans in 1954. Wiskott described three brothers with a similar disease, whose sisters were unaffected. In 2006, a German research group analysed family members of Wiskott's three cases, and surmised they probably shared a novel frameshift mutation of the first exon of the WASp gene.

The temples feature various statues and reliefs of animals, including goats (for which Malta is noted) and pigs. Most notable of the statues found in the Temples are about 2.5 m in height, and are said to represent a sort of Mother Goddess. There are several of these statues scattered around the various temples, and are thought to represent fertility. There was also one of three small baked clay figurines in the form of what is said to be a priest that was found here. =Churches= The parish church of ƒ¶al Tarxien is dedicated to the Annunciation of Our Lady, hence the Tarxinizi (the people of ƒ¶al Tarxien) consider the Blessed Virgin Mary, particularly at Her Annunciation as the Patron and Protector of their town and its whole population. The church was elevated to the status of parish in 1592, making it one of the oldest parishes of Malta. A key part of ƒ¶al Tarxien culture is the feast of the Annunciation, whose feast is celebrated in late May or first Sunday of June. It is celebrated with religious celebrations and liturgical services at the parish church, and publicly with street decorations, band marches in the village streets and large aerial and ground firework displays. A street in Tarxien The second largest church in town is dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ better known by the locals as \\"Ta' l-Erwieƒß\\" (). The word means \\"of the souls\\" and it is used due to the old cemetery that surrounds the church. This church is right next to the renowned Tarxien Neolithic Temples and is visited by many tourists as many of the prehistoric remains were also found in the mentioned cemetery. There are two other small chapels in ƒ¶al Tarxien. These are dedicated to St. Bartholomew and St. Mary respectively. There is also another chapel which is housed in the convent of the Sisters of Charity. This is dedicated to 'Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception'. The same congregation have a school. There is also another church dedicated to St. Nicholas of Tolentino and a convent which belongs to the Augustinian Friars.

It is caused by halftone dots growing in area between the original printing film and the final printed result. In practice, this means that an image that has not been adjusted to account for dot gain will appear too dark when it is printed. Dot gain calculations are often an important part of a CMYK color model. Definition It is defined as the increase in the area fraction (of the inked or colored region) of a halftone dot during the prepress and printing processes. Total dot gain is the difference between the dot size on the film negative and the corresponding printed dot size. For example, a dot pattern that covers 30% of the image area on film, but covers 50% when printed, is said to show a total dot gain of 20%. However, with today's computer-to-plate imaging systems, which eliminates film completely, the measure of \\"film\\" is the original digital source \\"dot\\". Therefore, dot gain is now measured as the original digital dot versus the actual measured ink dot on paper. Mathematically, dot gain is defined as: :DG=a_{text{print}}-a_{text{form}} where aprint is the ink area fraction of the print, and aform is the prepress area fraction to be inked. The latter may be the fraction of opaque material on a film positive (or transparent material on a film negative), or the relative command value in a digital prepress system. Causes Dot gain is caused by ink spreading around halftone dots. Several factors can contribute to the increase in halftone dot area. Different paper types have different ink absorption rates; uncoated papers can absorb more ink than coated ones, and thus can show more gain. As printing pressure can squeeze the ink out of its dot shape causing gain, ink viscosity is a contributing factor with coated papers; higher viscosity inks can resist the pressure better. Halftone dots can also be surrounded by a small circumference of ink, in an effect called \\"rimming\\". Each halftone dot has a microscopic relief, and ink will fall off the edge before being eliminated entirely by the fountain solution (in the case of offset printing). Finally, halation of the printing film during exposure can contribute to dot gain. Yule‚ÄìNielsen effect and \\"optical dot gain\\" The Yule‚ÄìNielsen effect, sometimes known as optical dot gain, is a phenomenon caused by absorption and scattering of light by the substrate. Light becomes diffused around dots, darkening the apparent tone. As a result, dots absorb more light than their size would suggest. The Yule‚ÄìNielsen effect is not strictly speaking a type of dot gain, because the size of the dot does not change, just its relative absorbance. Some densitometers automatically compute the absorption of a halftone relative to the absorption of a solid print using the Murray‚ÄìDavies formula. Controlling dot gain Not all halftone dots show the same amount of gain. The area of greatest gain is in midtones (40‚Äì60%); above this, as the dots contact one another, the perimeter available for dot gain is reduced. Dot gain becomes more noticeable with finer screen ruling, and is one of the factors affecting the choice of screen. Dot gain can be measured using a densitometer and color bars in absolute percentages. Dot gain is usually measured with 40% and 80% tones as reference values. A common value for dot gain is around 23% in the 40% tone for a 150 lines per inch screen and coated paper. Thus a dot gain of 19% means that a tint area of 40% will result in a 59% tone in the actual print. Modern prepress software usually includes utility to achieve the desired dot gain values using special compensation curves for each machine. Computing the area of a halftone pattern The inked area (coverage) fraction of the dot may be computed using the Yule-Nielsen model. This requires the optical densities of the substrate, the solid-covered area, and the halftone tint, as well as the value of the Yule-Nielsen parameter, n. Pearson has suggested a value of 1.7 be used in absence of more specific information. However, it will tend to be larger when the halftone pattern in finer and when the substrate has a wider point spread function. Models for dot gain Another factor upon which dot gain depends is the dot's area fraction. Dots with relatively large perimeters will tend to have greater dot gain than dots with smaller perimeters. This makes it useful to have a model for the amount of dot gain as a function of prepress dot area fraction. =An early model= Tollenaar and Ernst tacitly suggested a model in their 1963 IARIGAI paper. It was :mathrm{gain}_{mathit{TE}}=a_{mathrm{form}} ,left(1 - a_{mathit{vf}}right) where avf, the shadow critical area fraction, is the area fraction on the form at which the halftone pattern just appears solid on the print. This model, while simple, has dots with relatively small perimeter (in the shadows) exhibiting greater gain than dots with relatively larger perimeter (in the midtones). =Haller's model= Karl Haller, of FOGRA in Munich, proposed a different model, one in which dots with larger perimeters tended to exhibit greater dot gain than those with smaller perimeters. One result derivable from his work is that dot gains depend on the shape of the halftone dots. =The GRL model= Viggiano suggested an alternate model, based on the radius (or other fundamental dimension) of the dot growing in relative proportion to the perimeter of the dot, with empirical correction the duplicated areas which result when the corners of adjacent dots join. Mathematically, his model is: :mathrm{gain}_{mathit{GRL}}=begin{cases} a_{mathrm{form}}-a_{mathit{wf}}, & mathrm{for} a_{mathrm{form}}leq a_{mathit{wf}}[6pt] 2,Delta_{0,50}sqrt{a_{mathrm{form}}left(1-a_{mathrm{form}}right)}, & mathrm{for} a_{mathit{wf}} where Œî0,50 is the dot gain when the input area fraction is ; the highlight critical printing area, awf, is computed as: :a_{mathit{wf}}=begin{cases} dfrac{4Delta_{0,50}^{2}}{1+4Delta_{0,50}^{2}}, & mathrm{for} Delta_{0,50}<0[6pt] 0, & mathrm{for} Delta_{0,50}geq0end{cases} and the shadow critical printing area, avf, is computed according to :a_{mathit{vf}}=begin{cases} 1, & mathrm{for} Delta_{0,50}leq0[6pt] dfrac{1}{1+4Delta_{0,50}^{2}}, & mathrm{for} Delta_{0,50}>0end{cases} Note that, unless Œî0,50 = 0, either the highlight critical printing fraction, awf, will be nonzero, or the shadow critical printing fraction, avf will not be 1, depending on the sign of Œî0,50. In instances in which both critical printing fractions are non-trivial, Viggiano recommended that a cascade of two (or possibly more) applications of the dot gain model be applied. =Empirical models= Sometimes the exact form of a dot gain curve is difficult to model on the basis of geometry, and empirical modeling is used instead. To a certain extent, the models described above are empirical, as their parameters cannot be accurately determined from physical aspects of image microstructure and first principles. However, polynomials, cubic splines, and interpolation are completely empirical, and do not involve any image-related parameters. Such models were used by Pearson and Pobboravsky, for example, in their program to compute dot area fractions needed to produce a particular color in lithography.

It falls in the month of KƒÅrttikai (mid-November to mid-December) as per Tamil calendar. The full moon day of this Karthigai month is called Karthigai pournami. In Kerala, this festival is known as Thrikkarthika, celebrate to welcome Goddess Shakti. In the rest of India, a related festival called Kartik Purnima is celebrated in a different date. It is celebrated in the name of 'Lakshabba' in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu. The name of the festival born from the name of the god Kartikeya. In Tamil calendar the name of this month is called as KƒÅrttikai (‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æï‡Øà). The story of six stars Many legends and lyrical poetry have grown around this star. The six stars are considered in Indian mythology as the six celestial nymphs who reared the six babies in the Saravana tank which later were joined together to form the six faced Muruga. They are Dula, Nitatni, Abhrayanti, Varshayanti, Meghayanti and Chipunika. He is therefore called Karthikeya, the incarnation of Lord Shiva as his second son after Lord Ganesha. It is believed that Lord Shiva created Muruga from his 3rd eyeThird eye The third eye of Lord Shiva from all his six faces were used to create Lord Muruga as his son of six primary faces (Tatpurusam,Tatpurusha The face of Concealing Grace Aghoram,Aghora The face of annihilation Sadyojatam,Sadyojata The face of Creation Vamadevam,Vamadeva The face of Preservation/Healing/Dissolution/Rejuvenation Eesanam,Ishana The face of Revealing Grace AdhomukamThe 6th face of shiva specified in literature named sri kanda puranam (Skanda Purana)).

While merging he also formed into a six faced (Arumugam and twelve handed god. The Lord Murugan is also portrayed with his six playsSix Abodes of Murugan The six spiritual temples (homes) of Lord Murugan and worshiped with six names. As the six nymphs helped in growing the child, Lord Shiva blessed immortality to the six nymphs as ever living stars on the sky. Any worship performed to this six stars is equal to worshiping Lord Muruga himself. They are worshiped by lighting up rows of oil lamps (Deepam) in the evening of the festival day around the houses and streets. Karthikai Deepam is also known as Kartikeya, or Muruga's birthday. Other Mythological Stories and Literature on this 6 stars Pleiades in folklore and literature or K·πõttikƒÅ.Other Mythological Stories and Literature on this 6 stars Pleiades in folklore and literature History One of the earliest references to the festival is found in the Aganaanooru, a book of poems, which dates back to the Sangam Age (200 B.C. to 300 A.D.). The Aganaanooru clearly states that Karthigai is celebrated on the full moon day (pournami) of the month of Karthigai, as per South Indian calendar. It was one of the most important festivals (peruvizha) of the ancient Tamils, including now the areas of modern Kerala too. Avaiyyar, the renowned poet of those times, refers to the festival in her songs. Karthikai Deepam is one of the oldest festivals celebrated by Tamil people. The festival finds reference in Sangam literature like Akana·πâ≈´·πüu and the poems of Auvaiyar.The Hindu: Glow of prosperity Karthigai is referred in Sangam literature as Peruvizha. =Mythological references= Lord Shiva appeared as an endless flame of light before Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma, who each considered himself supreme and said that the matter could be tested if the two could search for Lord Shiva's Head and feet. Lord Vishnu took the form of a boar(Sanskrit:Varaha, Tamil:Varaham(pandri) ) and delved deep into the earth, Lord Brahma that of a swan(Sanskrit:Hansa, Tamil:Annam) and flew towards the skies. Lord Vishnu failed in his search and returned. But Lord Brahma, chancing upon a piece of Thazhambu, a flower, learnt from it that it had been floating down for thirty thousand years from Lord Shiva's head. He seized upon this and claimed to Lord Shiva that he had seen the other's top. Lord Siva realized the falsehood and pronounced that there would never be a temple for Lord Brahma in this world. He also interdicted the use of the flower Thazhambu in his worship. Lord Shiva appeared as a flame, this day is called Karthikai Maha Deepam.Lakhs of devotees witness lighting of Karthigai Deepam at Tiruvannamalai The Hindu News Paper Article 10 December 2019 Celebrations Nizhal Thangal, Attoor decorated with Agal vilakkus during the Karthikai Deepam celebrations on 2013-11-16 Rows of Agal vilakkus (Clay Oil lamps) are lit in every house. Karthigai is essentially a festival of lamps. The lighted lamp is considered an auspicious symbol. It is believed to ward off evil forces and usher in prosperity and joy. While the lighted lamp is important for all Hindu rituals and festivals, it is indispensable for Karthigai. This festival is also celebrated to commemorate the bonding between brothers and sisters in south India(analogous to Bhaiya-Dhuj and Raakhi). Sisters pray for the prosperity and success of their brothers and light lamps to mark the occasion. In Telugu households, Kaartheeka maasam (month) is considered very auspicious. The Kartheeka month starts on the day of Deepawali. From that day till the end of the month, oil lamps are lit every day. On Kartheeka Pournami (full moon of Kartheeka month) oil lamp with 365 wicks, prepared at home, are lit in Lord Shiva temples. Apart from that, Kaartheeka puranam is read and fasting is observed till sunset, every day for the whole month. = Celebrations at Tiruvannamalai, Tamil nadu and Koneshwaram, Trincomalee= Thiruvannamalai Maha Deepam will be lit at around 6 pm at the top of 2668 ft high holy mountain. The entire Mountain is Shiva Linga. Maha Deepam will be lit using nearly 3500 kg of Ghee. Sri Arthanareeshwara will bless devotees in the Temple at the time of lighting the Maha Deepam. The Maha Deepam will be visible around the Holy Mountain in a radius of 35 km. Lakhs of devotees will perform 16 km Girivalam (circumambulation of the holy mountain). The Moist Black Ash (what they call as 'Mai' in Tamil) that remains after the lighting of the Ghee & Cotton Wick will be distributed as Prasadam to devotees on the Marghazhi Arudra Darisanam day.

It covers an area of about 21 km2. Administratively it is a subdistrict (tambon) of Ko Pha-ngan District (amphoe) of Surat Thani Province. its official population was 1,382. The main settlement is Ban Mae Hat. Ko Tao has gained the nickname ‚ÄúDeath Island‚Äù in the media due to at least 10 foreign tourists found dead under criminal or suspicious circumstances since 2008. The economy of the island is almost exclusively centered on tourism, especially scuba diving. Scuba diving is extremely popular in Ko Tao due to clear visibility, inexpensive pricing and the range of sealife to be seen .  History  Initially the island was uninhabited, with only the occasional fisherman from the neighbouring islands, looking for shelter in a storm or just resting before continuing on his journey. It would appear from old maps and descriptions that this island was known by European cartographers and mariners as \\"Pulo Bardia\\", indicating that it was first settled by Malayo-Polynesian peoples. The old maps show a chain of three islands aligned north-south and lying off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. The most northerly and smallest of these islands is marked P. Bardia, the name it had until the early 1900s. The best map example is by John Thornton from The English Pilot, the Third Book, dated 1701, but the specific map of the Gulf of Siam is dated around 1677. Also see maps of the East Indies by William Dampier c.1697. By modern standards of accuracy, the islands are poorly placed on early maps. Seventeenth century marine navigation and cartography used the \\"backstaff\\" which, in this area, was accurate to one degree of longitude, or around 60 nautical miles. The Edinburgh Gazetteer, or Geographical Dictionary published in 1827 also mentions the island and provides a geographical position. In his 1852 book titled Narrative of a Residence in Siam. by Frederick Arthur Neale, the author describes the people and wildlife of Bardia. According to the account there were farms and even cows in a village on the bay lying on the west side of the island. The book includes a fanciful illustration of \\"Bardia\\" showing huts and palm trees. Joseph Huddart in 1801 included these directions for navigating the islands, \\"To the N.W. by N are two islands of about the same height as Poolo Carnom [Ko Samui]; the first, called SANCORY [Ko Pha- ngan], is 7 leagues from Carnom; the other...,named BARDA, or Bardia [Ko Tao], is 7¬Ω leagues from Sancory.\\" (A league is approximately 3 nautical miles or 5.5 km.) On 18 June 1899, King Chulalongkorn visited Ko Tao and left as evidence his monogram on a huge boulder at Jor Por Ror Bay next to Sairee Beach. This place is still worshiped today. In 1933 the island started to be used as a political prison. In 1947 Khuang Abhaiwongse, prime minister at that time, pleaded and received a royal pardon for all prisoners on the island. Everybody was taken to the shore of Surat Thani and Ko Tao was abandoned again. In the 1980s overseas travellers began to visit Ko Tao and it quickly became a popular destination. In the 1990s the island became known as a diving site. Environment The island is an important breeding ground for hawksbill and green turtles. The development of tourism has negatively impacted the health of these grounds, but a breeding programme organised in 2004 by the Royal Thai Navy and KT-DOC, a coalition of local scuba diving centres, has reintroduced hundreds of juvenile turtles to the island's ecosystem. Chumpon Pinnacle, a dive site to the west of the island has a reputation for divers in search of both whale sharks and bull sharks. However, because of warmer water temperatures over the last year a great number of bull sharks have migrated to cooler waters. The island is host to over 130 species of hard corals, and over 223 species of reef fishes belonging to 53 families. Ko Tao in the Gulf of Thailand Diving conditions have improved dramatically in the past few years with the continuing education of locals by the dive community. El Ni√±o weather patterns caused a warming of the waters which resulted in the loss of a great deal of the shallow corals near the island. Since then, the recovery has been swift and dramatic. Ko Tao now offers some of the best scuba diving in the Gulf of Thailand. And with help by the island conservation group, Save Koh Tao, the island's environmental outlook is improving. As one of the world's most popular diving destinations, more attention is being focused on the negative effects of diving on coral reef health around Ko Tao. Natural factors combined with over-use of some areas has led to an increase in the abundance of corallivores such as Drupella snails and the crown-of-thorns starfish around the island in recent years. In 2012, a Marine Zoning and Regulations Master Plan was developed for the island and subsequently become local law, but the positive effects of increased management have yet to be realized. Tourism and development on the island has grown steadily for the last several decades, with public infrastructure often lagging far behind. Shortages of electricity and fresh water are common, and both solid and liquid waste management is inadequate. About 42,000 tonnes of solid waste are produced annually on the island, resulting in a 45,000 tonne garbage mountain while the island's waste incinerator sits idle. Tourism Wat Ko Tao Sairee Beach Bluespotted ribbontail ray photographed in the waters around Ko Tao Ko Tao is one of Thailand's most popular tourist spots. Although the Bangkok Post cannot decide if it receives 132,000 or three million visitors a year, it does receive a lot. The island is well known for scuba diving and snorkeling, as well as hiking, rock climbing, and bouldering. The most popular place for tourists is Sairee on the west coast, which has a white sandy beach of 1.7 km interrupted only by a few huge boulders and a scattering of medium budget resorts and restaurants. Chalok Baan Khao, to the south of the island, is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative for those wishing to escape the crowds. A great many granite boulders, both in the forests and on the beaches of Ko Tao, attract a growing number of climbers. Koh Tao has a little over 25 dive sites to explore. Ko Tao is less developed than Ko Samui and Ko Pha-ngan, but has become increasingly popular especially with the mid-20s backpacker crowd in search of relatively inexpensive scuba diving certification. For the past two years the demographics of the island have seen an age increase, with many of the visitors who first visited the island over ten years ago now returning with their families. A series of tourist deaths ‚Äì including murder and alleged suicide ‚Äì particularly since 2014, has prompted some to advise that tourists avoid visiting Ko Tao. Population To serve the tourist population, some 3,000‚Äì5,000 Burmese workers staff the island. There is a dominant Thai family on the island that owns several dive schools, resorts, and bars. Transportation Main street, Ko Tao Motorbikes are the main form of transport, however visitors are advised to drive responsibly as motorbikes are the main cause of injury to tourists in the area.

In the Quechua language, it means ‚Äúmeeting-encounter\\". During this ritual, men and women from different communities will meet and begin the festivities by dancing. The women will then form circles and begin chanting while the men proceed to fight each other; rarely the women will join in the fighting as well. Large tinkus are held in Potos√≠ during the first few weeks of May. The story behind this cultural dance is that long ago, the colonial hacendados set fights between indigenous campesinos for their amusement. Pututu trumpets were used by the Indians in order to call for a Tinku encounter, as well as to assemble the peons when the hacendado required of their presence. Tinku dance costumes are colorful and decorative. Women wear a dress, abarcas, and a hat and men wear an undershirt, pants, jacket, sandals (abarcas), and hard helmet like hats. Even though the people were slaves, they loved to dance, and would often fight, but never really hurting each other. Because of the rhythmic way the men throw their fists at each other, and because they stand in a crouched stance going in circles around each other, a dance was formed. This dance, the Festive Tinku, simulates the traditional combat, bearing a warlike rhythm. The differences between the Andean tradition and the dance are the costumes, the role of women, and the fact that the dancers do not actually fight each other. The Festive Tinku has become a cultural dance for all of Bolivia, although it originated in Potos√≠. Tinku combat =History= The Bolivian tradition began with the indigenous belief in Pachamama, or Mother Nature. The combat is in praise of Pachamama, and any blood shed throughout the fighting is considered a sacrifice, in hopes of a fruitful harvest and fertility. Because of the violent nature of the tradition there have been fatalities, but each death is considered a sacrifice which brings forth life, and a donation to the land that fertilizes it. The brawls are also considered a means of release of frustration and anger between the separate communities. Tinkus usually last two to three days. During this time, participants will stop every now and then to eat, sleep, or drink. =Methods of combat= During the brawl itself, men will often carry rocks in their hands to have greater force in their punches, or they will just throw them at opponents. Sometimes, especially in the town of Macha in Potos√≠, where the brawl gets the most violent, men will wrap strips of cloth with shards of glass stuck to them around their fists to cause greater damage. Slingshots and whips are also used, though not as much as hand-to-hand combat. The last day of the fight is considered the most violent and police almost always have to separate the mass of bloody men and women. =Attire= Men attend tinkus wearing traditional monteras, or thick helmet- like hats made of thick leather, resembling helmets from the Conquistadors. These helmets are often painted and decorated with feathers.Bolivia by Andrew Dean Nystrom and Morgan Konn pg. 233 Their pants are usually simple black or white with traditional embroidering near their feet. Often the men wear wide thick belts tied around their waist and stomach for more protection. Festive Tinku dance The Festive Tinku, a much more pleasant experience than a ceremonial tinku, has many differences. It has been accepted as a cultural dance in the whole nation of Bolivia. Tinku music has a loud constant drum beat to give it a native warlike feel, while charangos, guitars, and zampo√±as (panpipes) play melodies. The dancers perform with combat like movements, following the heavy beat of the drum. =Costumes= For men, the costumes are more colorful. Their monteras are usually decorated with long colorful feathers. Tinku Suits, or the outfits men wear during Festive Tinku performances, are usually made with bold colors to symbolize power and strength, instead of the neutral colors worn in ceremonial tinkus that help participants blend in. Women wear long embroidered skirts and colorful tops. Their costumes are completed by extravagant hats, painted and decorated with various long and colorful feathers and ribbons. Men and women wear walking sandals so they can move and jump easily. =Dance= The dance is performed in a crouching stance, bending at the waist. Arms are thrown out and there are various kicks, while the performers move in circles following the beat of the drum. Every jump from one foot to the next is followed by a hard stomp and a thrown fist to signify the violence from the ceremonial tinku. Many times the dancers will hold basic and traditional instruments in their hands that they will use as they stomp, just to add more noise for a greater effect.

Tsushima won many of Japan's top literary prizes in her career, including the Izumi Ky≈çka Prize for Literature, the Noma Literary New Face Prize, the Noma Literary Prize, the Yomiuri Prize and the Tanizaki Prize. The New York Times called Tsushima \\"one of the most important writers of her generation.\\" Her work has been translated into over a dozen languages. Early life Tsushima was born in Mitaka, Tokyo. Her father was famed novelist Osamu Dazai, who committed suicide when she was one year old. She later drew on the aftermath of this experience in writing her short story \\"The Watery Realm.\\" Career While attending Shirayuri Women's University she published her first fiction. At age 24 she published her first collection of stories, Carnival (Shaniku-sai). A prolific writer, she was the winner of several literary prizes. In 1972 her story \\"Pregnant with a Fox\\" (\\"Kitsune wo haramu\\") was a runner-up for the Akutagawa Prize. She was awarded the Izumi Ky≈çka Prize for Literature in 1977 for Kusa no Fushido (Bedchamber of Grass), and the first annual Noma Literary New Face Prize for Hikari no ry≈çbun (The Family) in 1979. In 1983 she was awarded the Kawabata Yasunari Literature Prize for her short story \\"Danmari ichi\\" (\\"The Silent Traders\\"), and in 1986 she won the Yomiuri Prize for her novel Yoru no hikari ni owarete (Driven by the Light of the Night). In 1998 she was awarded the 34th Tanizaki Prize and the 51st Noma Literary Prize for her novel Hi no yama ‚Äì yamazaruki (Mountain of Fire: Account Of A Wild Monkey). In 2002 she won the Osaragi Jiro Prize for Warai ookami (Laughing Wolf). Writing style Tsushima's work is often characterized as feminist, though she did not apply this label to her own work. Her writing explores the lives of marginalized people, usually women, who struggle for control of their own lives against societal and family pressures. She has cited Tennessee Williams as a literary influence. Unlike many of her contemporaries, whose writing about women tended to assume a nuclear family, Tsushima wrote about women who had been abandoned by family members. Her stories, several of which draw on her own experience as a single mother, focus on the psychological impact of abandonment on those left behind.

Yapese Dictionary. Updated 27 July 2012. Retrieved 25 November 2013.), or Fei: large doughnut-shaped, carved disks of (usually) calcite, up to 4 m (13 ft) in diameter (most are much smaller). The smallest can be as little as in diameter. There are around 6,000Patterson, Carolyn Bennett, et al. \\"At the Birth of Nations: In the Far Pacific\\". National Geographic Magazine, October 1986, page 498. National Geographic Virtual Library. of the large, circular stone disks carved out of limestone formed from aragonite and calcite crystals. Rai stones were quarried on several of the Micronesian islands, mainly Palau, but briefly on Guam as well, and transported to Yap for use as money. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency. The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership. In the case of stones that are too large to move, buying an item with one simply involves agreeing that the ownership has changed. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person to whom it is passed and no physical movement of the stone is required. Form and value Rai stones are circular disks with a hole in the middle. The stones vary widely in size. The largest are in diameter and thick and weigh . The largest rai stone is located on Rumung island, near Riy village. Smaller rai stones might have a diameter of from . The extrinsic (perceived) value of a specific stone is based on not only its size and craftsmanship, but also its history. If many people‚Äîor no one at all‚Äîdied when the specific stone was transported, or a famous sailor brought it in, the value of the rai stone increases by reason of its anecdotal heft. Rai stones were, and still are, used in rare important social transactions, such as marriage, inheritance, political deals, sign of an alliance, ransom of the battle dead, or, rarely, in exchange for food. Many of them are placed in front of meetinghouses or along pathways. The physical location of the stone is often not significant. Although the ownership of a particular stone might change, the stone itself is rarely moved due to its weight and risk of damage. The names of previous owners are passed down to the new one. In one instance, a large rai being transported by canoe and outrigger was accidentally dropped and sank to the sea floor. Although it was never seen again, everyone agreed that the rai must still be there, so it continued to be transacted as genuine currency. What is important is that ownership of the rai is clear to everyone, not that the rai is physically transferred or even physically accessible to either party in the transfer. In this manner, the use of rai stones as a monetary system can be thought as an early example of a distributed ledger, similar to those used in modern blockchain technology. History Yapese quarried the limestone rocks from the islands of Palau and took them to Yap with canoes and rafts. There is evidence that some limestone has been mined in Palau by Yapese as early as 500 AD, but more widespread mining started in the time period of 1000‚Äì1400 AD. Local legend holds that the Yapese discovered the rock of Palau about 500‚Äì600 years ago when an expedition led by a man called Anagumang landed on Palau. reprinted in Mankiw, N. Gregory. Essentials of Economics, Third Edition. Mason: South-Western, 2004. pp. 454‚Äì455 Limestone was nonexistent in Yap and therefore very valuable to the Yapese. First Anagumang ordered his men to cut stone into the shape of fish but eventually a circular shape was chosen, probably because it was easier to transport. A pole was put through the hole in the center of the stone so that laborers could carry the stone. The largest of the disks probably needed hundreds of men to transport. Residents of Palau in turn required Yapese to pay in beads, coconut meat and copra or in the form of services for the privilege of quarrying. It is unknown how long money stones have been used in Yap. Flat rocks have been found there that are up to 2000 years old, but the oldest do not resemble today's rai stones, and it is not known if they were used as money. It is nevertheless clear that the size of the stones grew sharply after European techniques and traders came to Yap. The stones may have evolved from smaller carved beads. In 1871, the Irish-American David Dean O'Keefe was shipwrecked near Yap and was helped by the natives. Later, he assisted the Yapese in acquiring rai and in return received copra and trepang, which were valuable exports in the Far East. O'Keefe provided the Yapese with iron tools. As a result, a form of inflation set in and rai stones acquired with his help were less valuable than more ancient ones. The book His Majesty O'Keefe is the story of his life on Yap. A film of the same name starring Burt Lancaster was made in 1954.His Majesty O'Keefe on IMDb The trade for rai stones eventually stopped at the beginning of the 20th century due to trade disputes between Spanish and German interests in the area. Quarries were abandoned. When Imperial Japanese forces took over Yap during World War II, they used some of the stones for construction or as anchors. Economist Milton Friedman has compared the monetary role of the stone money to the reserves of gold held in Fort Knox for foreign governments. Although modern currency has replaced the stones as everyday currency, the rai stones are still exchanged in traditional ways between the Yapese. They are a national symbol and are depicted on local license plates.

Time featured him among its Global 100 young leaders profile series published in 1994 while the World Economic Forum also nominated him. The Wall Street Journal America Economia, The Wall Street Journal's Latin American magazine, named him Latin American businessman of the year in 1990 and he was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and 1992. Virando a Pr√≥pria Mesa (\\"Turning the Table on Yourself\\"), his first book, became the best selling non-fiction book in the history of Brazil. He has since written two books in English on the transformation of Semco and workplace re-engineering: Maverick, an English version of \\"Turning Your Own Table\\" published in 1993 and an international bestseller, and The Seven-Day Weekend in 2003. Semco 1980‚Äì1990 Semler went to work for his father's company, originally called Semler & Company, then a mixer and agitator supplier in S√£o Paulo. Semler clashed with his father, Antonio Semler, who supported a traditional autocratic style of management whereas young Semler favoured a decentralised, participatory style. Furthermore, Ricardo favoured diversification away from the struggling shipbuilding industry, which his father opposed. After heated clashes, the son threatened to leave the company. Rather than see this happen, Antonio Semler resigned as CEO and vested majority ownership in his son in 1980 when Ricardo was 21 years old. On his first day as CEO, Ricardo Semler fired sixty percent of all top managers. He began work on a diversification program to rescue the company. Semler experienced health issues, culminating in a fainting spell at a pump factory (Baldwinsville, New York) when he was 25. After seeing a doctor at the Lahey Clinic (Boston), he was diagnosed with an advanced case of stress. This inspired him to want a greater work-life balance for himself and his employees. Attempts to introduce a matrix organisational structure in 1986 failed to achieve desired improvements. In the late 1980s, three engineers at Semco proposed setting up a Nucleus of Technological Innovation (NTI) to develop new businesses and product lines which Semler endorsed. At the end of the first six months, NTI had identified 18 such opportunities. Following the success of this initiative, satellite units were encouraged throughout Semco. By the late 1980s, these satellite units accounted for two-thirds of its new products and two-thirds of its employees. An assessment of Semler's business philosophy through phenomenological analysis (within the radical change of Semco's management style), led Bomba≈Ça to conclude that it was an \\"...excellent exemplification of good leadership.\\" Eleanor Glor notes that the only accounts about the change in management style come from Ricardo Semler himself, rather than from the affected workers. Semco 1990‚Äì2004 After dramatic restrictions on liquidity instituted by Brazilian president Fernando Collor de Mello to combat hyperinflation in 1990, the Brazilian economy went into a severe downturn, forcing many companies to declare bankruptcy. Workers at Semco agreed to wage cuts, providing their share of profits was increased to 39%, management salaries were cut by 40% and employees were given the right to approve every item of expenditure. Performing multiple roles during the crisis gave workers greater knowledge of the operations and more suggestions on how to improve the business. Reforms implemented during that time led to 65% reduction in inventories, a marked reduction in product delivery times and a product defects rate that fell to less than 1%. As the business climate improved, Semco's revenues and profitability improved dramatically. , Semco had annual revenue of $212 million, up from $4 million in 1982 and $35 million in 1994, with an annual growth rate of up to 40 percent a year. It employed 3,000 workers in 2003, as opposed to 90 in 1982. The company's units include: * the industrial machinery unit, which now manufactures mixing equipment as opposed to pumps * Sembobac, a partnership with Baltimore Air Cooler making cooling towers * Cushman and Wakefield Semco, a partnership with Rockefeller property company Cushman and Wakefield managing properties in Brazil and Latin America * Semco Johnson Controls, a partnership with Johnson Controls, managing large scale facilities such as airports and hospitals * ERM, a partnership with Environmental Resources Management, one of the world's leading environmental consultants * Semco Ventures, offering high technology and Internet services * SemcoHR, a human resources management firm * Semco-RGIS, an inventory control firm As Semco grew, Ricardo Semler received a great deal of recognition. He was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and in 1992, and the World Economic Forum named him as one of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow. A high- profile committee appointed by CIO Magazine featuring Tom Peters, Jim Champy and Michael Hammer selected Semco as one of the most successfully re- engineered companies in the world. The BBC included Semco in its series on Reengineering the Business for creating one of the most successful management structures in business.  Other activities  Semler has reduced his involvement in Semco in the past decade to pursue other activities. He wrote a book Maverick on his experience at Semco which became a worldwide bestseller in 1993. His second book, The Seven-Day Weekend: Changing the Way Work Works was published in 2003. He has appeared in the media around the world and speaks regularly to business schools, businesses and groups to promote his philosophy of industrial democracy. He has also been a visiting scholar at Harvard Business School. Semler has been Vice President of the Federation of Industries of Brazil and a member of SOS Atlantic Forest, the leading environmental defence organisation in Brazil. He founded The Ralston-Semler Foundation and the Lumiar School, a democratic school where children from 0 to 14 years old engage in projects of their interest. There are three such schools ‚Äî one in the city of S√£o Paulo and two in the vicinity of Campos do Jord√£o, in the state of S√£o Paulo. = Semler principles institutions = As of late 2016, Semler was involved in the foundation of other ventures which intends to teach other entrepreneurs and businesspeople how to implement a people-centric management in their companies called Semco Style Institute where people are formed to find the right way to apply Semler's principles, and Leadwise where people learn via online courses about all the people based management styles available (Including Semler's principles described in his book Maverick, Holacracy, Teal Organizations, etc), they also analyze success cases of companies from different industries and countries where this kind of methodology was applied.

He theorized that a human being could very well survive the trip across the ocean without provisions and decided to test his theory himself in order to save thousands of lives of people lost at sea.  Life  On October 19, 1952 Bombard began his solitary trip, after visiting his newborn daughter in France, across the Atlantic for the West Indies. He had sailed in the Atlantic Ocean solo before, from Tangier to Casablanca (August 13 ‚Äì August 20), and from Casablanca to Las Palmas (August 24 ‚Äì September 3). However the original plan was to sail across the Atlantic with a friend, English yachtsman Jack Palmer, with whom he sailed just before from Monaco to Menorca (May 25 ‚Äì June 11), but Jack abandoned Alain in Tangier. Bombard sailed in a Zodiac inflatable boat called l'H√©r√©tique, which was only long, taking only a sextant and almost no provisions. Bombard reports he survived by fishing (and using fish as source of both fresh water and food) with a self-made harpoon and hooks and harvesting the surface plankton with a small net. He also drank a limited amount of seawater for a long period on his trip. On the October 23, 4th day of the journey Bombard had to mend a torn old sail, while the backup sail was blown away. He also made a major navigation mistake which made him believe that he was sailing much faster than he actually did. On the 53rd day of the journey he encountered a ship. The crew told him that he was still over short of his goal. However, after the ship's crew offered him a meal, Bombard decided to go on. Bombard reached Barbados December 23, 1952, after of travel. Bombard had lost and was briefly hospitalized. He published a book about his trip entitled \\"Naufrag√© Volontaire\\" in 1953. Bombard's claim was later tested and contested by Hannes Lindemann, a German physician, canoeist and sailing pioneer, although both the French and Taiwanese navies concurred with Bombard's findings, the Taiwanese exercise extending to 134 days. Lindemann wanted to repeat Bombard's trip in order to gain a better understanding of living on salt water and fish, but found that he needed fresh water (from rain) most days. Lindemann later claimed that Bombard had actually taken along fresh water and consumed it on the ocean, and that he had also been secretly provided further supplies during his voyage. Lindemann's own observations about reactions to scarce fresh water supplies became the basis for the World Health Organization's navigation recommendations. Bombard died in Toulon in 2005 at age 80. Media appearances Bombard was featured in an episode of the educational television program 3-2-1 Contact in 1986, in which he coaches two of the teenaged cast members on his life-raft survival techniques using a real raft on the open sea.

She claimed that she had inherited the position of a female chief of her tribe after her mother had died. The position, however, demanded that she would be a virgin. She had fallen in love with a Christian and if she went back, the tribe would discover she was not a virgin any more and she would be forced to submit to genital mutilation. Thus she applied for political asylum on 29 March 1997. The INS officials suspected that her passport had been forged or otherwise altered, had her detained and began proceedings to expel her. Abankwah was detained for over two years in the privately operated Queens Detention Facility in Jamaica, Queens, New York, when her application for asylum was twice rejected, first by an immigration judge, and then in 1999 by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Eventually, the INS investigation determined that the \\"Abankwah\\" was an impostor. Her real name was Regina Norman Danson. She had adopted the name of another Ghanaian woman who was living in Maryland and whose passport had been stolen in Ghana. Danson admitted that she had given a wrong name but that her story was still true, which Norman refused to acknowledge, insisting her mother was deceased. Further inquiries from Ghana showed that her mother, who had never been a tribal leader, was still alive. Immigration Judge Donn Livingston noted that the practice was predominant in the northern part of Ghana, had been decreasing, and that the Ghanaian government had declared female circumcision illegal in 1994. The case came to the attention of feminist and human rights activists who began to lobby for her release. They included actresses Julia Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave and then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision in July 1999 and granted Danson asylum. INS continued to investigate and found \\"overwhelming evidence\\" of fraud. The U.S. Department of Justice was still hesitant to pursue a fraud conviction because of possible public furor and bad publicity but indicted her in 2001 on fraud shortly before the statute of limitations ran out. The real Abankwah cooperated with INS to have the case cleared. The fraud trial began on 14 January 2002. Prosecutor Ronnie Abrams stated that the bid for political asylum made a \\"mockery of the immigration system and real victims of genital mutilation\\". Tribal Chief Nana Kwa Bonko V testified that Danson was not in the tribe's royal succession and that they did not practice female circumcision. According to GhanaWeb, Danson was to be sentenced for fraud on 23 March 2003, \\"for up to 16 months in prison, after which she will be deported to Ghana\\".\\"Mutilation fibber freed\\", nypost.com, 13 August 2003. However, she was sentenced to time served by federal Judge Charles Sifton. (She spent 29 months in an immigration detention center.) And, based on an amici curiae brief (\\"ON PETITION FOR REVIEW FROM THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\\"), on behalf of Regina Danson Norman in 2014 by the Immigrant Defense Project, she apparently was never deported or removed from the United States.

He was the son of Evangelos Marangos, a Greek cotton merchant. Marengo grew up in the Greek community in Alexandria, Egypt. In his childhood he produced his own satirical hobby magazine. In 1929 he went to study at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris, graduating in 1931. He began to draw cartoons for newspapers, including Le Canard encha√Æn√©, Le Petit Parisien, the Daily Herald and The Daily Telegraph. Marengo attended the University of Oxford in 1939, but when World War II erupted, he joined the Ministry of Information and drew 3.000 propaganda posters, leaflets, and political cartoons in various languages, including three dialects of Arabic and Persian. This included British propaganda effort to get the support of the Persians. He wrote eight books. He was also involved with the Political Warfare Executive in the French and North African and later Middle East matters. After the war Marengo went back to his studies in Oxford and graduated at the end of 1946 due to accelerated BA programme. His eventual thesis was The Cartoon as a Political Weapon in England: 1783-1832. From 1939 he designed and printed his own Christmas cards for his friends and business connections. They invariably consisted of a cartoon depicting a major political development of the outgoing year. He also imprinted on them his cartoonist coat of arms: a shield with a drawing of his face and the word 'Kem' on a green field, supported on either side by an African man in white, wearing a red fez and bandana and cocking a snook. It was topped by a coronet with the motto at the bottom, 'Apres moi le deluge'. He had two sons with his wife Una, Richard and Alexander. Publications *Oua Riglak.

Birth William Melville was born son of a baker and publican in Direenaclaurig Cross, Sneem, County Kerry, Ireland. He moved to London in the 1860s and followed his father's footsteps as a baker before he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1872. Scotland Yard In 1882 he was chosen to be one of the founding members of the Special Irish Branch that was founded to work against Fenians and anarchists. Melville was posted to the Le Havre port, during which posting his children, James Benjamin (1885) (later Sir James Melville KC) and Cecile Victorinne (1886; died in London in 1891), were born. In December 1888 Melville returned to London and was assigned to protect the Shah of Persia in his state visit. His duties later expanded to the protection of British Royal Family and he foiled the Jubilee Plot against Queen Victoria in 1887. In 1891 he began to campaign against anarchists by raiding and wrecking anarchist clubs and underground printing houses. He also revealed the Walsall Plot. In 1893 Melville became Superintendent of Scotland Yard's Special Branch when his predecessor John Littlechild retired to become a private investigator. When he fired veteran sergeant Patrick McIntyre, McIntyre went to press and claimed that Melville had instigated the whole Walsall Plot himself, a claim vindicated by police files released over 80 years later. In the next ten years, Melville embarked on a large series of well-publicized raids against anarchists. He went to Victoria Station to personally arrest bomber Th√©odule Meunier. In 1896 Melville recruited Shlomo Rosenblum (later known as Sidney Reilly) as an informer in an organization he suspected to be involved with Russian anarchists. In 1901 he worked with Gustav Steinhauer of the German Secret Service to thwart a plot against the Kaiser during the state funeral of Queen Victoria. In June 1900 Melville met future stage magician Harry Houdini when he came to Scotland Yard to showcase his abilities as an escapologist. When Houdini released himself easily from the police handcuffs, Melville befriended him and reputedly learned lock picking. On 1 November 1903, Melville resigned as superintendent but was secretly recruited to lead a new intelligence section in the War Office, MO3, which was redesignated M05 in 1907.Andrew, p. 6 Working under commercial cover from an unassuming flat in London under the alias persona William Morgan, Melville ran both counterintelligence and foreign intelligence operations, capitalizing on the knowledge and foreign contacts he had accumulated during his years running Special Branch. In 1909 the Government Committee on Intelligence, with advocacy of Richard Burden Haldane and Winston Churchill, established a new Secret Service Bureau with a Home Section under command of Captain Sir Vernon Kell and a Foreign Section under Commander Sir Mansfield Cumming. Melville's unit was folded into Kells department, which, while acting in Home matters, remained subordinate to the War Office.Andrew, p. 21 By 1910 it was clear that the Home Section and the Foreign Section would seek their own identities, and Kell's department, the Security Service separated from Cummings' Secret Intelligence Service.Andrew, p. 27 According to the conclusions of author Andrew Cook, his biographer, which are not accepted by all historians, Melville then became the head of British Secret Service with the code name \\"M\\". Still, the service had small budget and on occasion Melville had to do the job himself. Secret Service Bureau Melville's own section continued as a separate Special Section of the Secret Service Bureau and he concentrated on looking for German spies. In August 1914 the Bureau eventually identified the barbershop of Karl Gustav Ernst as the centre of a German spy ring.Andrew, p. 81 Death William Melville died of kidney failure in February 1918.

It is widely known across Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where it is traditionally served fresh, wrapped inside a banana leaf, as well as in many Asian stores internationally ‚Äì being sold as frozen food. It can be eaten solely as a snack or with steamed rice as part of a meal. Otak means \\"brains\\" in Indonesian and Malay, and the name of the dish is derived from the idea that the dish somewhat resembles brains, being whitish grey, soft and almost squishy. Nevertheless, only the Indonesian otak-otak has whitish colour, while the otak-otak from Malaysia and Singapore has reddish- orange or brown colouring acquired from chili, turmeric and curry powder. Distribution Otak-otak in Makassar, Indonesia Otak-otak seller pouring spicy peanut sauce. Grilling otak-otak in Malaysia Muar, Johor, Malaysia available at the street. Otak-otak from Katong, Singapore. Otak-otaks in Malaysia and Singapore are reddish. Otak-otak is widely spread on both sides of Malacca Strait and also Java. It is believed that the dish was a fusion of Malay and Peranakan origins. In Indonesia, otak-otak believed comes from Palembang cuisine of South Sumatra, Indonesia and spread throughout to the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Malay Peninsula. In Indonesia, three cities are famous for their otak-otak; Palembang, Jakarta and Makassar, nevertheless most of coastal fishing towns in Indonesia are familiar with this dish. On the Bangka island, the town of Belinyu is famous as a production center of otak- otak. The southern Malaysian town of Muar in Johor is a popular destination for it ‚Äì people from surrounding states and even Singaporeans often visit to buy the famous otak-otak in bulk. It is commonly known in Singapore as otah. Composition Otak-otak is made by mixing fish paste with a mixture of spices. The type of fish used to make otak-otak might vary, mackerel is commonly used in Malaysia, while ikan tenggiri (wahoo) is popular ingredient in Indonesia. Other types of fish such as bandeng (milkfish) and the more expensive ikan belida (featherback fish) might be used. The ground fish and starch is seasoned with spices which usually includes garlic, shallot, coconut milk, pepper, salt and sugar. In Indonesia, the mixture typically contains fish paste, shallots, garlic, scallions, egg, coconut milk, and sago starch or can be substituted for tapioca starch. In Malaysia, it is usually a mixture between fish paste, chili peppers, garlic, shallots, turmeric, lemon grass and coconut milk. The mixture is then wrapped in a banana leaf that has been softened by steaming, then grilled or steamed.Otak-otak. In Jakarta, Indonesia, one finds otak-otak being sold in small stalls near bus stops, especially during afternoon rush hour. Some of the best otak-otak can be found in Makassar; the main ingredient is fresh king mackerel fish, also called king fish or spanish mackerel. In Malaysia Otak-otak is well-known and commonly found in a town called Muar, Johor located south of West Peninsular Malaysia. The otak-otak from Muar is particularly renowned in Malaysia. The Muar's Otak- otak is extraordinary being wrapped inside the mangrove attap (Nipa palm) leaves and clipped using stapler or toothpick at both ends before being grilled or roasted on the stove. The flavor combines the fragrance of burnt attap leaves, the softness of fish meat and chili spices. The degree of spiciness corresponds to the amount of chilies being used. Since otak-otak is boneless fishcake, it is also suitable for children. While fish otak-otak is most common, otak-otak is also made with prawns, often resulting in a more textured variety. In Muar, there is also otak-otak made from cuttlefish, shrimp, crab meat, fish head and even chicken. Other than grilling in wrapped attap leaves, otak-otak might be conveniently and directly steamed instead. Steamed otak-otak is in rectangular shape without any attap leaves wrapping. Otak-otak are served best freshly hot, as a side dish with rice or as snacks during tea time. Regional varieties There are different recipes of otak- otak originating from different regions. In Indonesia, otak-otak commonly associated with Palembang, South Sumatra. However, other regions in Indonesia also popular for their otak-otak recipes, such as Jakarta and Makassar. In Palembang, people eat otak-otak with cuko (Palembangese sweet and sour spicy vinegar sauce), while across the strait on Bangka Belitung islands, the slightly different sour cuko sauce is made with a mixture of vinegar, shrimp paste and tauco fermented soybean paste. In Jakarta however, they enjoy it with spicy peanut sauce. Malaysian Nyonya otak-otak (Malay: otak-otak Nyonya), with Peranakan origins, from the northern Malaysian state of Penang, is steamed as a cake in banana leaf. The otak-otak from Indonesia, the south of Malaysia, and Singapore is wrapped up as a thin slice using banana or coconut leaf and grilled over a charcoal fire. As a result, it ends up drier and with a more distinct smoky fish aroma. The colour of otak-otak from Indonesia is whitish, while the otak-otak from Malaysia and Singapore is reddish-orange. Other varieties of otak-otak do exist. Although otak-otak is traditionally made with fish meat, modern versions of otak may use crab or prawn meat or even fish head.  Similar dishes  A type of delicacy similar to otak-otak from Terengganu is called Sata. A similar Indonesian dish employing banana leaf is called pepes. Other types of otak-otak include dishes called pais ikan, botok that are made of fish paste cooked in banana leaves. Otak-otak is quite similar to Szczecin paprikas (). The Philippines has a similar delicacy called tupig, which is cooked in the same manner as otak-otak ‚Äì albeit the former is a sweet version. A thick batter made of glutinous rice flour (known locally as galapong) coconut strips, coconut milk, sugar and nuts is wrapped in banana leaves, and then grilled over coals. Tupig is a well-known delicacy in the northern Philippine province of Pangasinan.

Early life and education Jan Krukowiecki was born on 15 December 1772 in Lw√≥w. He studied at the Theresianum in Vienna and joined the Austrian army. Military Career Krukowiecki fought in the campaigns against Turkish troops in the Balkans during the 6th Austro-Turkish War (1788-1791). In September 1794 Krukowiecki protested against the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy response to the March- November of 1794 Ko≈õciuszko Uprising by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and resigned his officer's commission. He spent the next 12 years in retirement. In 1806 Krukowiecki joined the French army and fought in Napoleon's campaigns. In 1812 he was part of the Napoleon's army in the war against Russia. He was wounded at Smolensk and received the Legion of Honour, was promoted to general of brigade and took command of a cavalry brigade. At the battle of Leipzig he fought under general Sokolnicki but failed to secure the Halle Gate. On 1 March 1814 Krukowiecki received command of the Polish guard of honor at Versailles. In 1814 Tsar Alexander I commissioned Krukowiecki to go to England because of his knowledge of the language. He was to secure the reparations of Polish prisoners of war. When he returned to Paris, he saw that his conduct in Leipzig was questioned in a public pamphlet. He sued general Sokolnicki, who had written the pamphlet under a pseudonym, but lost. Krukowiecki proceeded to report to the Tsar and arrived in Moscow in February 1815 before he returned to Paris. On 16 April the same year, during a banquet in honor of Russian and Polish officers, he stomped on Sokolnicki's toe. He was subjected to a court martial but when Sokolnicki died in September 1816, Krukowiecki was merely removed from active army service and returned to Poland. In August 1831 Krukowiecki became head of Polish government during the November Uprising, but had to surrender Warsaw to the Russians in September and was sent to Siberia. When he returned to Poland where he was tried for treason but acquitted. Krukowiecki settled on his wife's estate at Popie≈Ñ, near Rogowo, where he died on 17 April 1850.

The armed forces were greatly expanded and reorganised‚Äîthe war marked the founding of the Royal Air Force. The highly controversial introduction, in January 1916, of conscription for the first time in British history followed the raising of the largest all-volunteer army in history, known as Kitchener's Army, of more than 2,000,000 men. The outbreak of war was a socially unifying event. Enthusiasm was widespread in 1914, and was similar to that across Europe.Gregory (2008); Pennell (2012) On the eve of war, there was serious domestic unrest amongst the labour and suffrage movements and especially in Ireland. But those conflicts were postponed. Significant sacrifices were called for in the name of defeating the Empire's enemies and many of those who could not fight contributed to philanthropic and humanitarian causes. Fearing food shortages and labour shortfalls, the government passed legislation such as the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, to give it new powers. The war saw a move away from the idea of \\"business as usual\\" under Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and towards a state of total war (complete state intervention in public affairs) by 1917 under the premiership of David Lloyd George; the first time this had been seen in Britain. The war also witnessed the first aerial bombardments of cities in Britain. Newspapers played an important role in maintaining popular support for the war. Large quantities of propaganda were produced by the government under the guidance of such journalists as Charles Masterman and newspaper owners such as Lord Beaverbrook. By adapting to the changing demographics of the workforce (or the \\"dilution of labour\\", as it was termed), war-related industries grew rapidly, and production increased, as concessions were quickly made to trade unions. In that regard, the war is also credited by some with drawing women into mainstream employment for the first time. Debates continue about the impact the war had on women's emancipation, given that a large number of women were granted the vote for the first time in 1918. The experience of individual women during the war varied; much depended on locality, age, marital status and occupation.Braybon (1990)Braybon (2005) The civilian death rate rose due to food shortages and Spanish flu, which hit the country in 1918. Military deaths are estimated to have exceeded 850,000. The Empire reached its zenith at the conclusion of peace negotiations. However, the war heightened not only imperial loyalties but also individual national identities in the Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) and India. Irish nationalists after 1916 moved from collaboration with London to demands for immediate independence (see Easter Rising), a move given great impetus by the Conscription Crisis of 1918. Military historians continue to debate matters of tactics and strategy. However, in terms of memory of the war, historian Adrian Gregory argues that: :\\"The verdict of popular culture is more or less unanimous. The First World War was stupid, tragic and futile. The stupidity of the war has been a theme of growing strength since the 1920s. From Robert Graves, through 'Oh! What a Lovely War' to 'Blackadder Goes Forth,' the criminal idiocy of the British High Command has become an article of faith.\\" Government =Asquith as prime minister= H. H. Asquith (c. 1915), prime minister at the beginning of the war On 4 August, King George V declared war on the advice of his prime minister, H. H. Asquith, leader of the Liberal Party. Britain's basic reasons for declaring war focused on a deep commitment to France and avoidance of splitting the Liberal Party. Top Liberals threatened to resign if the cabinet refused to support France‚Äîwhich would mean loss of control of the government to a coalition or to the Unionist (i.e. Conservative) opposition. However, the large antiwar element among Liberals would support the war to honour the 1839 treaty regarding guarantees of Belgian neutrality, so that rather than France was the public reason given.Bentley B. Gilbert, \\"Pacifist to interventionist: David Lloyd George in 1911 and 1914. Was Belgium an issue?.\\" Historical Journal 28.4 (1985): 863‚Äì885.Zara S. Steiner, Britain and the origins of the First World War (1977) pp 235‚Äì237. Therefore, the public reason given out by the government. and used in posters, was that Britain was required to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London. \\"The Scrap of Paper ‚Äì Enlist Today\\", 1914 British propaganda poster emphasizes defence of Belgium. The strategic risk posed by German control of the Belgian and ultimately French coast was considered unacceptable. German guarantees of post-war behaviour were cast into doubt by her blas√© treatment of Belgian neutrality. However, the Treaty of London had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's neutrality. Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that Britain herself would have violated Belgian neutrality by blockading her ports (to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) in the event of war with Germany. Britain's duty to her Entente partners, both France and Russia, were paramount factors. The Foreign Secretary Edward Grey argued that the secret naval agreements with France created a moral obligation 'to save France from defeat by Germany. British national interest rejected German control of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Grey warned that to abandon its allies would be a permanent disaster: if Germany won the war, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, Britain would be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her Empire vulnerable to isolation.Steiner, Britain and the origins of the First World War (1977) pp 230‚Äì235. Eyre Crowe, a senior Foreign office expert said: > Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must happen. > (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia. What > will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and Russia win. > What would be their attitude towards England? What about India and the > Mediterranean? =Crisis of Liberal leadership= The Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the Great War called for strong measures that the Party had long rejected. The result was the permanent destruction of the ability of the Liberal Party to lead a government. Historian Robert Blake explains the dilemma: : the Liberals were traditionally the party of freedom of speech, conscience and trade. They were against jingoism, heavy armaments and compulsion....Liberals were neither wholehearted nor unanimous about conscription, censorship, the Defence of the Realm Act, severity toward aliens and pacifists, direction of labour and industry. The Conservatives... had no such misgivings.Robert Blake, The Decline of Power: 1915‚Äì1964 (1985), p.3 Blake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives called for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of realpolitik and the balance of power.Blake, The Decline of Power (1985), p.3 The British people were disappointed that there was no quick victory in the war. They long had taken great pride and expense in the Royal Navy, but now there was little to cheer about. The Battle of Jutland in May 1916, was the first and only time the German fleet challenged control of the North Sea, but it was overmatched and was reassigned mostly to helping the more important u-boats. Since the Liberals ran the war without consulting the Unionists (Conservatives) there were heavy partisan attacks. However even Liberal commentators were dismayed by the lack of energy at the top. At the time public opinion was intensely hostile, both in the media and in the street, against any young man in civilian garb and labeled as a slacker. The leading Liberal newspaper, the Manchester Guardian complained: :The fact that the Government has not dared to challenge the nation to rise above itself, is one among many signs... The war is, in fact, not being taken seriously.... How can any slacker be blamed when the Government itself is slack.Manchester Guardian 1 May 1915, editorial, in Asquith's Liberal government was brought down in , due in particular to a crisis in inadequate artillery shell production and the protest resignation of Admiral Fisher over the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign against Turkey. Reluctant to face doom in an election, Asquith formed a new coalition government on , with the majority of the new cabinet coming from his own Liberal party and the Unionist (Conservative) party, along with a token Labour representation. The new government lasted a year and a half, and was the last time Liberals controlled the government.Barry McGill, \\"Asquith's Predicament, 1914‚Äì1918.\\" Journal of Modern History 39.3 (1967): 283‚Äì303. in JSTOR The analysis of historian A. J. P. Taylor is that the British people were so deeply divided over numerous issues, But on all sides there was growing distrust for the Asquith government. There was no agreement whatsoever on wartime issues. The leaders of the two parties realized that embittered debates in Parliament would further undermine popular morale, and so the House of Commons did not once discuss the war before May 1915. Taylor argues: :The Unionists, by and large, regarded Germany as a dangerous rival, and rejoiced at the chance to destroy her. They meant to fight a hard-headed war by ruthless methods; the condemned Liberal 'softness' before the war and now. The Liberals insisted on remaining high-minded. Many of them income to support the war only when the Germans invaded Belgium....Entering the war for idealistic motives, the Liberals wish to fight it by noble means and found it harder to abandon their principles than to endure your defeat in the field. =Lloyd George as prime minister= This coalition government lasted until 1916, when the Unionists became dissatisfied with Asquith and the Liberals' conduct of affairs, particularly over the Battle of the Somme.Barry McGill, \\"Asquith's Predicament, 1914‚Äì1918,\\" Journal of Modern History (1967) 39#3 pp. 283‚Äì303 in JSTOR Asquith's opponents now took control, led by Bonar Law (leader of the Conservatives), Sir Edward Carson (leader of the Ulster Unionists), and David Lloyd George (then a minister in the cabinet). Law, who had few allies outside his own party, lacked sufficient support to form a new coalition; the Liberal Lloyd George, on the other hand, enjoyed much wider support and duly formed a majority-Conservative coalition government with Lloyd George Liberals and Labour. Asquith was still the party head but he and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament.John M. McEwen, \\"The Struggle for Mastery in Britain: Lloyd George versus Asquith, December 1916.\\" Journal of British Studies 18#1 (1978): 131‚Äì156. Lloyd George immediately set about transforming the British war effort, taking firm control of both military and domestic policy.John Grigg, Lloyd George: War Leader 1916‚Äì1918 (2002) vol 4 pp 1‚Äì30A. J. P. Taylor, English History, 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) pp 73‚Äì99 In the first 235 days of its existence, the War Cabinet met 200 times. Its creation marked the transition to a state of total war‚Äîthe idea that every man, woman and child should play his or her part in the war effort. Moreover, it was decided that members of the government should be the men who controlled the war effort, primarily utilising the power they had been given under the Defence of the Realm Act. For the first time, the government could react quickly, without endless bureaucracy to tie it down, and with up-to-date statistics on such matters as the state of the merchant navy and farm production. The policy marked a distinct shift away from Asquith's initial policy of laissez- faire,Baker (1921) p 21 which had been characterised by Winston Churchill's declaration of \\"business as usual\\" in . The success of Lloyd George's government can also be attributed to a general lack of desire for an election, and the practical absence of dissent that this brought about.Beckett (2007), pp 499‚Äì500 David Lloyd George (c. 1920), prime minister at the end of the war In rapid succession in spring 1918 came a series of military and political crises.A. J. P. Taylor, English History, 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) pp 100‚Äì106 The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies. On 21 March 1918 Germany launched a full scale Spring Offensive against the British and French lines, hoping for victory on the battlefield before United States troops arrived in large numbers. The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in confusion, and facing defeat London realized it needed more troops to fight a mobile war. Lloyd George found half a million soldiers and rushed them to France, asked American President Woodrow Wilson for immediate help, and agreed to the appointment of the French Marshal Foch as commander in chief on the Western Front, so that Allied forces could be coordinated to handle the German offensive.John Grigg, Lloyd George: War Leader 1916‚Äì1918 (2002) vol 4 pp 478‚Äì83 Despite strong warnings that it was a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn F√©in movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.Alan J. Ward, \\"Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish Conscription Crisis,\\" Historical Journal (1974) 17#1 pp. 107‚Äì129 in JSTORGrigg, Lloyd George vol 4 pp 465‚Äì88 On , a senior army officer on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, prompted a second crisis when he went public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military.John Gooch, \\"The Maurice Debate 1918,\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1968) 3#4 pp. 211‚Äì228 in JSTORJohn Grigg, Lloyd George: War leader, 1916‚Äì1918 (London: Penguin, 2002), pp 489‚Äì512 Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.A. J. P. Taylor, English History, 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) pp 108‚Äì11 Historian George H. Cassar has evaluated Lloyd George's legacy as a war leader: :After all that has been said and done, what are we to make of Lloyd George‚Äôs legacy as a war leader? On the home front he achieved varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.George H. Cassar, Lloyd George at War, 1916‚Äì1918 (2009) p 351 online at JSTOR =Collapse of the Liberal Party= In the general election of 1918, Lloyd George, \\"the Man Who Won the War\\", led his coalition into another khaki election and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging Labour Party. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader Bonar Law wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates ‚Äì this \\"coupon\\", as it became known, was issued to opponents of many sitting Liberal MPs, devastating the incumbents.Trevor Wilson, \\"The Coupon and the British General Election of 1918,\\" Journal of Modern History, (1964) 36#1 pp. 28‚Äì42 in JSTOR Asquith and most of his Liberal colleagues lost their seats. Lloyd George was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party. The Liberal party never recovered.Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914‚Äì1935 (1966) pp 135‚Äì85 =Finance= Before the war, the government spent 13 percent of gross national product (GNP); in 1918 it spent 59 percent of GNP. The war was financed by borrowing large sums at home and abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, and cancelling unneeded projects.Martin Horn, Britain, France, and the financing of the First World War (2002). The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. In 1913‚Äì14, indirect taxes on tobacco and alcohol yielded ¬£75 million, while direct taxes yielded ¬£88 million, including an income tax of ¬£44 million and estate duties of ¬£22 million. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918, direct taxes were 80 percent of revenue.Peter Dewey, War and progress: Britain 1914‚Äì1945 (1997) pp 28‚Äì31. There was a strong emphasis on being \\"fair\\" and being \\"scientific.\\" The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917.Anthony J. Arnold, \\"‚ÄòA paradise for profiteers‚Äô? The importance and treatment of profits during the First World War.\\" Accounting History Review 24#2‚Äì3 (2014): 61‚Äì81.Mark Billings and Lynne Oats, \\"Innovation and pragmatism in tax design: Excess Profits Duty in the UK during the First World War.\\" Accounting History Review 24#2‚Äì3 (2014): 83‚Äì101. Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate grew to 5s in the pound (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30 percent of national expenditure, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from ¬£625 million to ¬£7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased it 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.A. J. P. Taylor, English History 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) pp 40 ‚Äì 41.M. J. Daunton, \\"How to Pay for the War: State, Society and Taxation in Britain, 1917‚Äì24,\\" English Historical Review (1996) 111# 443 pp. 882‚Äì919 Monarchy Punch cartoon depicts King George sweeping away his German titles. The British royal family faced a serious problem during the First World War because of its blood ties to the ruling family of Germany, Britain's prime adversary in the war. Before the war, the British royal family had been known as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1910, George V became king on the death of his father, Edward VII, and reigned throughout the war. He was the first cousin of the German Emperor Wilhelm II, who came to symbolise all the horrors of the war. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the royal House of W√ºrttemberg. During the war H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's \\"alien and uninspiring court\\", and George famously replied: \\"I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien.\\"Nicolson (1952), p 308 On 17 July 1917, to appease British nationalist feelings, King George issued an Order in Council that changed the name of the his family to the House of Windsor. He specifically adopted Windsor as the surname for all descendants of Queen Victoria then living in Britain, excluding women who married into other families and their descendants. He and his relatives who were British subjects relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and adopted English surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by creating them British peers. Thus, his cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became the Marquess of Milford Haven, while his brother-in-law, the Duke of Teck, became the Marquess of Cambridge. Others, such as Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig- Holstein and Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, simply stopped using their territorial designations. The system for titling members of the royal family was also simplified.Nicolson (195), p 310 Relatives of the British royal family who fought on the German side were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by a 1919 Order in Council under the provisions of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. Tsar Nicholas II, Berlin, 1913 Developments in Russia posed another set of issues for the monarchy. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was King George's first cousin and the two monarchs looked very much alike.At George's wedding in 1893, The Times claimed that the crowd may have confused Nicholas with George, because their beards and uniforms made them look alike (The Times 7 July 1893, p 5) When Nicholas was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the liberal Russian Government asked that the tsar and his family be given asylum in Britain. The cabinet agreed but the king was worried that public opinion was hostile and said no. It is likely the tsar would have refused to leave Russia in any case. He remained and in 1918 he and his family were ordered killed by Lenin, the Bolshevik leader.Nicolson (1952), p 301 The Prince of Wales ‚Äì the future Edward VIII ‚Äì was keen to participate in the war but the government refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured.Roberts (2000), p 41 Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare at first hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.Ziegler (1991), p 111Duke of Windsor (1998), p 140 King George V and his son the Prince of Wales visiting the Grand Fleet in 1918. From left to right: Admiral David Beatty, RN; Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman, USN; King George V; Prince of Wales; Vice Admiral William S. Sims, USN Other members of the royal family were similarly involved. The Duke of York (later George VI) was commissioned in the Royal Navy and saw action as a turret officer aboard HMS Collingwood at the battle of Jutland but saw no further action in the war, largely because of ill health.Bradford (1989), pp 55‚Äì76 Princess Mary, the King's only daughter, visited hospitals and welfare organisations with her mother, assisting with projects to give comfort to British servicemen and assistance to their families. One of these projects was Princess Mary's Christmas Gift Fund, through which ¬£162,000 worth of gifts was sent to all British soldiers and sailors for Christmas 1914. She took an active role in promoting the Girl Guide movement, the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), the Land Girls and in 1918, she took a nursing course and went to work at Great Ormond Street Hospital.Thornton-Cook (1977), p.229 Defence of the Realm Act The first Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) was passed on 1914, during the early weeks of the war,Beckett (2007), Chronology though in the next few months its provisions were extended.Beckett (2007), p 348 It gave the government wide-ranging powers, such as the ability to requisition buildings or land needed for the war effort. Some of the things the British public were prohibited from doing included loitering under railway bridges, feeding wild animals and discussing naval and military matters. British Summer Time was also introduced.Beckett (2007), p 383 Alcoholic beverages were now to be watered down, pub closing times were brought forward from to , and, from , Londoners were no longer able to whistle for a cab between and . It has been criticised for both its strength and its use of the death penalty as a deterrent ‚Äì although the act itself did not refer to the death penalty, it made provision for civilians breaking these rules to be tried in army courts martial, where the maximum penalty was death. Internment The Aliens Restriction Act, passed on 5 August, required all foreign nationals to register with the police, and by 9 September just under 67,000 German, Austrian and Hungarian nationals had done so.PearsallPanayi 2014 p. 50 Citizens of enemy states were subject to restrictions on travel, possession of equipment that might be used for espionage, and residence in areas likely to be invaded.Panayi 2014 pp. 46‚Äì52 The government was reluctant to impose widespread internment. It rescinded a military decision of 7 August 1914 to intern all nationals of enemy states between the ages of 17 and 42, and focussed instead only on those suspected of being a threat to national security. By September, 10,500 aliens were being held, but between November 1914 and April 1915 few arrests were made and thousands of internees were actually released. Public anti-German sentiment, which had been building since October following reports of German atrocities in Belgium, peaked after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania on 7 May 1915. The incident prompted a week of rioting across the country, during which virtually every German-owned shop had its windows smashed. The reaction forced the government to implement a tougher policy on internment, as much for the aliens own safety as for the security of the country. All non-naturalised enemy nationals of military age were to be interned, while those over military age were to be repatriated, and by 1917 only a small number of enemy nationals were still residing at liberty.Panayi 2014 pp. 57, 71‚Äì78Panayi 2013 p. 50Denness p. 178 Armed forces =Army= August 1914: London army volunteers await their pay at St. Martin-in-the- Fields The British Army during World War I was small in size when compared to the other major European powers. In 1914, the British had a small, largely urban English, volunteer forceBeckett (2007), p 289 of 400,000 soldiers, almost half of whom were posted overseas to garrison the immense British Empire. (In , 74 of the 157 infantry battalions and 12 of the 31 cavalry regiments were posted overseas.) This total included the Regular Army and reservists in the Territorial Force. Together they formed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF),Chandler (2003), p 211 for service in France and became known as the Old Contemptibles. The mass of volunteers in 1914‚Äì1915, popularly known as Kitchener's Army, was destined to go into action at the battle of the Somme. In , conscription was introduced, and by the end of 1918, the army had reached its peak of strength of 4.5 million men. =Royal Navy= Ships of the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet The Royal Navy at the start of the war was the largest navy in the world due, for the most part, to the Naval Defence Act 1889 and the two-power standard which called for the navy to maintain a number of battleships such as their strength was at least equal to the combined strength of the next two largest navies in the world, which at that point were France and Russia.Sondhaus (2001), p 161 The major part of the Royal Navy's strength was deployed at home in the Grand Fleet, with the primary aim of drawing the German High Seas Fleet into an engagement. No decisive victory ever came. The Royal Navy and the German Imperial Navy did come into contact, notably in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, and at the Battle of Jutland. In view of their inferior numbers and firepower, the Germans devised a plan to draw part of the British fleet into a trap and put it into effect at Jutland in , but the result was inconclusive. In , the High Seas Fleet tried a similar enticement operation and was \\"lucky to escape annihilation\\". The lessons learned by the Royal Navy at Jutland made it a more effective force in the future. In 1914, the navy had also formed the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division from reservists, and this served extensively in the Mediterranean and on the Western Front. Almost half of the Royal Navy casualties during the War were sustained by this division, fighting on land and not at sea. =British air services= Royal Flying Corps recruitment poster At the start of the war, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), commanded by David Henderson, was sent to France and was first used for aerial spotting in , but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 1915. Aerial photography was attempted during 1914, but again only became effective the next year. In 1915 Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson and the RFC adopted an aggressive posture. By 1918, photographic images could be taken from , and interpreted by over 3,000 personnel. Planes did not carry parachutes until 1918, though they had been available since before the war.Beckett (2007), p 254 On 17 August 1917, General Jan Smuts presented a report to the War Council on the future of air power. Because of its potential for the 'devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale', he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the army and navy. The formation of the new service however would make the under utilised men and machines of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) available for action across the Western Front, as well as ending the inter-service rivalries that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement. On 1918, the RFC and the RNAS were amalgamated to form a new service, the Royal Air Force (RAF). Recruitment and conscription Poster by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, featuring left Particularly in the early stages of the war, many men, for a wide variety of reasons, decided to \\"join up\\" to the armed forces‚Äîby 1914, over 225,000 had signed up to fight for what became known as Kitchener's Army. Over the course of the war, a number of factors contributed to recruitment rates, including patriotism, the work of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in producing posters, dwindling alternative employment opportunities, and an eagerness for adventure to escape humdrum routine. Pals battalions, where whole battalions were raised from a small geographic area or employer, also proved popular. Higher recruitment rates were seen in Wales and Scotland, though in the case of the Welsh and Irish, political tensions tended to \\"put something of a blight upon enlistment\\". A 1914 poster shows a Scottish soldier in Belgium, in response to Germany describing the Treaty of London, which protected Belgium's independence and neutrality, as a \\"scrap of paper\\" when they invaded in August 1914.Te Papa (the Museum of New Zealand)'s description of the poster. Recruitment remained fairly steady through 1914 and early 1915, but fell dramatically during the later years, especially after the Somme campaign, which resulted in 500,000 casualties. As a result, conscription was introduced for the first time in for single men, and extended in May‚ÄìJune to all men aged 18 to 41 across England, Wales and Scotland, by way of the Military Service Acts.Beckett (2007), pp 291‚Äì5 Urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army. Dundee, where the female dominated jute industry limited male employment had one of the highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city.B. Lenman and J., Mackie, A History of Scotland (Penguin, 1991) Concern for their families' standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled.D. Coetzee, \\"A life and death decision: the influence of trends in fertility, nuptiality and family economies on voluntary enlistment in Scotland, August 1914 to December 1915\\", Family and Community History, November 2005, vol. 8 (2), pp. 77‚Äì89. After the introduction of conscription from January 1916 every part of the country was affected. The policy of relying on volunteers had sharply reduced the capacity of heavy industry to produce the munitions needed for the war. Historian R. J. Q. Adams reports that 19% of the men in the iron and steel industry entered the Army, 22% of the miners, 20% in the engineering trades, 24% in the electrical industries, 16% among small arms craftsmen, and 24% of the men who had been engaged in making high explosives.R. J. Q. Adams, \\"Delivering the Goods: Reappaising the Ministry of Munitions: 1915‚Äì1916.\\" Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies (1975) 7#3 pp: 232‚Äì244 at p. 238 in JSTOR In response critical industries were prioritised over the army (\\"reserved occupations\\"), including munitions, food production and merchant shipping. =Conscription Crisis of 1918= In April 1918 legislation was brought forward which allowed for extension of conscription to Ireland. Though this ultimately never materialised, the effect was \\"disastrous\\". Despite significant numbers volunteering for Irish regiments, the idea of enforced conscription proved unpopular. The reaction was based particularly on the fact that implementation of conscription in Ireland was linked to a pledged \\"measure of self-government in Ireland\\".Adams (1999), p 266 The linking of conscription and Home Rule in this way outraged the Irish parties at Westminster, who walked out in protest and returned to Ireland to organise opposition. As a result, a general strike was called, and on 1918, work was stopped in railways, docks, factories, mills, theatres, cinemas, trams, public services, shipyards, newspapers, shops, and even official munitions factories. The strike was described as \\"complete and entire, an unprecedented event outside the continental countries\\". Ultimately the effect was a total loss of interest in Home Rule and of popular support for the nationalist Irish Party who were defeated outright by the separatist republican Sinn F√©in party in the December 1918 Irish general election, one of the precursors of the Anglo-Irish War. =Conscientious objectors= The conscription legislation introduced the right to refuse military service, allowing for conscientious objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or to serve as a non-combatant in the army, according to the extent to which they could convince a Military Service Tribunal of the quality of their objection. Around 16,500 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers playing a large role. Some 4,500 objectors were sent to work on farms to undertake \\"work of national importance\\", 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties as stretcher bearers, but 6,000 were forced into the army, and when they refused orders, they were sent to prison, as in the case of the Richmond Sixteen.Silence in castle to honour First World War conscientious objectors dated 25 June 2013 at thenorthernecho.co.uk, accessed 19 October 2014 Some 843 conscientious objectors spent more than two years in prison; ten died while there, seventeen were initially given the death penalty (but received life imprisonment) and 142 were imprisoned on life sentences.Beckett (2007), p 507 Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution were disenfranchised for five years after the war.Taylor (2001), p 116 Naval and air raids German bombardments were concentrated on the east coast of England At the start of the First World War, for the first time since the Napoleonic Wars, the population of the British Isles was in danger of attack from naval raids. The country also came under attack from air raids by zeppelins and fixed-wing aircraft, another first. =Naval raids= The Raid on Yarmouth, which took place in , was an attack by the German Navy on the British North Sea port and town of Great Yarmouth. Little damage was done to the town itself, since shells only landed on the beach once German ships laying mines offshore were interrupted by British destroyers. One British submarine was sunk by a mine as it attempted to leave harbour and attack the German ships, while one German armoured cruiser was sunk after striking two mines outside its own home port.Massie (2004), pp 309‚Äì311 British propaganda fuelled by the German raid on Scarborough In December 1914, the German navy carried out attacks on the British coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. The attack resulted in 137 fatalities and 593 casualties,His Majesty's stationery Office (1922), pp 674‚Äì677 many of which were civilians. The attack made the German navy very unpopular with the British public, as an attack against British civilians in their homes. Likewise, the British Royal Navy was criticised for failing to prevent the raid. =Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft= In April 1916 a German battlecruiser squadron with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded the coastal ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main aim of the raid was to entice out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to intervene if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small to intervene so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.Tucker, Wood & Murphy (2005), P.193 British propaganda poster from 1915, drawing on the fear of zeppelin attacks to aid recruitment =Air raids= German zeppelins bombed towns on the east coast, starting on 1915 with Great Yarmouth. London was also hit later in the same year, on . Propaganda supporting the British war effort often used these raids to their advantage: one recruitment poster claimed: \\"It is far better to face the bullets than to be killed at home by a bomb\\" (see image). The reaction from the public, however, was mixed; whilst 10,000 visited Scarborough to view the damage there, London theatres reported having fewer visitors during periods of \\"Zeppelin weather\\"‚Äîdark, fine nights. Throughout 1917 Germany began to deploy increasing numbers of fixed-wing bombers, the Gotha G.IV's first target being Folkestone on 1917, following this attack the number of airship raids decreased rapidly in favour of raids by fixed wing aircraft, before Zeppelin raids were called off entirely. In total, Zeppelins dropped 6,000 bombs, resulting in 556 dead and 1,357 wounded.Powers (1976), pp 50‚Äì51 Soon after the raid on Folkestone, the bombers began raids on London: one daylight raid on 1917 by 14 Gothas caused 162 deaths in the East End of London.Beckett (2007), pp 258‚Äì261 In response to this new threat, Major General Edward Bailey Ashmore, a RFC pilot who later commanded an artillery division in Belgium, was appointed to devise an improved system of detection, communication and control,Bourne (2001), p 10 The system, called the Metropolitan Observation Service, encompassed the London Air Defence Area and would later extend eastwards towards the Kentish and Essex coasts. The Metropolitan Observation Service was fully operational until the late summer of 1918 (the last German bombing raid taking place on 1918).Bourne (2001), p 20 During the war, the Germans carried out 51 airship raids and 52 fixed-wing bomber raids on England, which together dropped 280 tons of bombs. The casualties amounted to 1,413 killed, and 3,409 wounded. The success of anti-air defence measures was limited; of the 397 aircraft that had taken part in raids, only 24 Gothas were shot down (though 37 more were lost in accidents), despite an estimated rate of 14,540 anti-air rounds per aircraft. Anti-zeppelin defences were more successful, with 17 shot down and 21 lost in accidents. Media =Propaganda= A world map showing territory that \\"Germany Wants\\" by Edward Stanford. 1917. Close reading of the quoted material shows that the map is misleading: it implies that Germany plans to annex all the territory in red, but this is only the case for a small fraction of it. Propaganda and censorship were closely linked during the war. The need to maintain morale and counter German propaganda was recognised early in the war and the War Propaganda Bureau was established under the leadership of Charles Masterman in . The Bureau enlisted eminent writers such as H G Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling as well as newspaper editors. Until its abolition in 1917, the department published 300 books and pamphlets in 21 languages, distributed over 4,000 propaganda photographs every week, and circulated maps, cartoons, and lantern slides to the media.D. G. Wright, \\"The Great War, Government Propaganda and English 'Men Of Letters' 1914‚Äì16.\\" Literature and History 7 (1978): 70+. Masterman also commissioned films about the war such as The Battle of the Somme, which appeared in , while the battle was still in progress as a morale-booster and in general it met with a favourable reception. The Times reported on 1916 that\\" :Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy.'War's Realities on the Cinema', The Times, London, 1916, p 3 The media -- including the press, film. posters and billboards--were called to arms as propaganda for the masses. The manipulators favoured upper-and middle- class authoritative characters to educate the masses. At the time cinema audience were largely working class blokes. By contrast in World War Two, equality was a theme and class differentials were downplayed.Stella Hockenhull, \\"Everybody‚Äôs business: Film, food and victory in the first world war.\\" Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television 35.4 (2015): 579-595. online =Newspapers= Newspapers during the war were subject to the Defence of the Realm Act, which eventually had two regulations restricting what they could publish:Paddock (2004), p 22 Regulation 18, which prohibited the leakage of sensitive military information, troop and shipping movements; and Regulation 27, which made it an offence to \\"spread false reports\\", \\"spread reports that were likely to prejudice recruiting\\", \\"undermine public confidence in banks or currency\\" or cause \\"disaffection to His Majesty\\". Where the official Press Bureau failed (it had no statutory powers until ), the newspaper editors and owners operated a ruthless self-censorship. Having worked for government, press barons Viscount Rothermere, Baron Beaverbrook (in a sea of controversy),McCreery (2005), pp 26‚Äì27 and Viscount Northcliffe all received titles. For these reasons, it has been concluded that censorship, which at its height suppressed only socialist journals (and briefly the right wing The Globe) had less effect on the British press than the reductions in advertising revenues and cost increases which they also faced during the war.Beckett (2007), pp 394‚Äì395 One major loophole in the official censorship lay with parliamentary privilege, when anything said in Parliament could be reported freely. The most infamous act of censorship in the early days of the war was the sinking of HMS Audacious in , when the press was directed not to report on the loss, despite the sinking being observed by passengers on the liner RMS Olympic and quickly reported in the American press.Paddock (2004), p 24 The most popular papers of the period included dailies such as The Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post, weekly newspapers such as The Graphic and periodicals like John Bull, which claimed a weekly circulation of 900,000.Paddock (2004), p 16 The public demand for news of the war was reflected in the increased sales of newspapers. After the German Navy raid on Hartlepool and Scarborough, the Daily Mail devoted three full pages to the raid and the Evening News reported that The Times had sold out by a quarter past nine in the morning, even with inflated prices.Paddock (2004), p 34 The Daily Mail itself increased in circulation from 800,000 a day in 1914 to by 1916. =News magazines= The public's thirst for news and information was in part satisfied by news magazines, which were dedicated to reporting the war. They included amongst others The War Illustrated, The Illustrated War News, and The War Pictorial, and were lavishly filled with photographs and illustrations, regardless of their target audience. Magazines were produced for all classes, and ranged both in price and tone. Many otherwise famous writers contributed towards these publications, of which H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling were three examples. Editorial guidelines varied; in cheaper publications especially it was considered more important to create a sense of patriotism than to relay up-to-the-minutes news of developments of the front. Stories of German atrocities were commonplace. =Music= On 13 August 1914, the Irish regiment the Connaught Rangers were witnessed singing \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\" as they marched through Boulogne by the Daily Mail correspondent George Curnock, who reported the event in that newspaper on 1914. The song was then picked up by other units of the British Army. In , it was sung in a pantomime by the well-known music hall singer Florrie Forde, which helped contribute to its worldwide popularity.Cryer (2009), p 188 Another song from 1916, which became very popular as a music hall and marching song, boosting British morale despite the horrors of that war, was \\"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag\\".Shepherd (2003), p 390 =War poems= There was also a notable group of war poets who wrote about their own experiences of war, which caught the public attention. Some died on active service, most famously Rupert Brooke, Isaac Rosenberg, and Wilfred Owen, while some, such as Siegfried Sassoon survived. Themes of the poems included the youth (or naivety) of the soldiers, and the dignified manner in which they fought and died. This is evident in lines such as \\"They fell with their faces to the foe\\", from the \\"Ode of Remembrance\\" taken from Laurence Binyon's For the Fallen, which was first published in The Times in .The Times on 1914. Female poets such as Vera Brittain also wrote from the home front, to lament the losses of brothers and lovers fighting on the front. Economy On the whole the British successfully managed the economics of the war. There had been no prewar plan for mobilization of economic resources. Controls were imposed slowly, as one urgent need followed another.William Ashworth, An Economic History of England, 1870‚Äì1939 (1960) pp 265‚Äì84. With the City of London the world's financial capital, it was possible to handle finances smoothly; in all Britain spent 4 million pounds everyday on the war effort. The economy (in terms of GDP) grew about 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943).Niall Ferguson, The Pity of War (1998) p 249 The war forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from private and government creditors in the United States.Steven Lobell, \\"The Political Economy of War Mobilization: From Britain's Limited Liability to a Continental Commitment,\\" International Politics (2006) 43#3 pp 283‚Äì304 Shipments of American raw materials and food allowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining productivity. The financing was generally successful,M. J. Daunton, \\"How to Pay for the War: State, Society and Taxation in Britain, 1917‚Äì24,\\" English Historical Review (1996) 111# 443 pp. 882‚Äì919 in JSTOR as the City's strong financial position minimized the damaging effects of inflation, as opposed to much worse conditions in Germany.T. Balderston, \\"War finance and inflation in Britain and Germany, 1914‚Äì1918,\\" Economic History Review (1989) 42#2 p p 222‚Äì244. in JSTOR Overall consumer consumption declined 18% from 1914 to 1919.B.R. Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (1962) p 371 Women were available and many entered munitions factories and took other home front jobs vacated by men.Gail Braybon, Women Workers in the First World War: The British Experience (1990)G. R. Searle, A New England?: Peace and War, 1886‚Äì1918 (OUP, 2005) pp. 777‚Äì793. Scotland specialized in providing manpower, ships, machinery, food (particularly fish) and money. Its shipbuilding industry expanding by a third. =Rationing= A British government wartime leaflet detailing the consequences of breaking the rationing laws In line with its \\"business as usual\\" policy, the government was initially reluctant to try to control the food markets. It fought off efforts to try to introduce minimum prices in cereal production, though relenting in the area of controlling of essential imports (sugar, meat and grains). When it did introduce changes, they were only limited in their effect. In 1916, it became illegal to consume more than two courses whilst lunching in a public eating place or more than three for dinner; fines were introduced for members of the public found feeding the pigeons or stray animals. In January 1917, Germany started using U-boats (submarines) in order to sink Allied and later neutral ships bringing food to the country in an attempt to starve Britain into defeat under their unrestricted submarine warfare programme. One response to this threat was to introduce voluntary rationing in , a sacrifice promoted by the King and Queen themselves.Condell & Liddiard (1987), p 18 Bread was subsidised from September that year; prompted by local authorities taking matters into their own hands, compulsory rationing was introduced in stages between and , as Britain's supply of wheat stores decreased to just six weeks worth.Morrow (2005), p 202 For the most part it benefited the health of the country, through the levelling of consumption of essential foods. To operate rationing, ration books were introduced on 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar.Palmer (1992), pp 355‚Äì356 During the war, average calorific intake decreased only three percent, but protein intake six percent.Beckett (2007), pp 380‚Äì382 =Industry= Forging steel shell cases Total British production fell by ten percent over the course of the war; there were, however, increases in certain industries such as steel. Although Britain faced a highly contentious Shell Crisis of 1915 With severe shortages of artillery shells on the Western Front.Peter Fraser, \\"The British 'Shells Scandal' of 1915.\\" Canadian Journal of History 18.1 (1983): 69-86. New leadership was called for. In 1915, a powerful new Ministry of Munitions under David Lloyd George was formed to control munitions production.Bentley Gilbert, David Lloyd George: Organizer of Victory 1912‚Äì1916 (1992), pp 209‚Äì50 The Government's policy, according to historian and Conservative politician J. A. R. Marriott, was that: : No private interest was to be permitted to obstruct the service, or imperil the safety, of the State. Trade Union regulations must be suspended; employers' profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economized by the dilution of labour and the employment of women; private factories must pass under the control of the State, and new national factories be set up. Results justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last delivered.J. A. R. Marriott, Modern England: 1885‚Äì1945 (4th ed. 1948) p. 376 By , just two million rounds of shells had been sent to France; by the end of the war the figure had reached , and a year's worth of pre-war production of light munitions could be completed in just four days by 1918. Aircraft production in 1914 provided employment for 60,000 men and women; by 1918 British firms employed over 347,000.Beckett (2007), pp 341‚Äì343 =Labour= Industrial production of munitions was a central feature of the war, and with a third of the men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily.John N. Horne, Labour at war: France and Britain, 1914‚Äì1918 (1991). Most trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, cutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. However the coal miners and engineers were less enthusiastic.G. R. Searle, A New England?: Peace and War, 1886‚Äì1918 (2005) pp. 819‚Äì821 Trade unions were encouraged as membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.B. R. Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (1962) p 68 Membership soared from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923. In 1914, 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) rising to 77% in 1920. Women were grudgingly admitted to the trade unions. Looking at a union of unskilled workers, Cathy Hunt concludes its regard for women workers, \\"was at best inconsistent and at worst aimed almost entirely at improving and protecting working conditions for its male members.\\"Cathy Hunt, \\"'Her Heart and Soul were with The Labour Movement': Using a Local Study to Highlight the Work Of Women Organizers Employed by the Workers' Union in Britain From the First World War to 1931.\\" Labour History Review 70.2 (2005): 167‚Äì184, quote p 180. Labour's prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.David Swift, \\"Patriotic labour in the era of the great war\\" (PhD. Dissertation University of Central Lancashire, 2014) online Detailed bibliography on pp 220‚Äì35. The Munitions of War Act 1915 followed the Shell Crisis of 1915 when supplies of material to the front became a political issue. The Act forbade strikes and lockouts and replaced them with compulsory arbitration. It set up a system of controlling war industries, and established munitions tribunals that were special courts to enforce good working practices. It suspended, for the duration, restrictive practices by trade unions. It tried to control labour mobility between jobs. The courts ruled the definition of munitions was broad enough to include textile workers and dock workers. The 1915 act was repealed in 1919, but similar legislation took effect during the Second World War.F. M. Leventhal, ed. Twentieth-Century Britain: An Encyclopedia (1995) p 78-80.Beckett (2007), p 369Gerry R. Rubin, \\"Law, War and Economy: The Munitions Acts 1915‚Äì17 and Corporatism in Context.\\" Journal of Law and Society 11.3 (1984): 317‚Äì333. It was only as late as December 1917 that a War Cabinet Committee on Manpower was established, and the British government refrained from introducing compulsory labour direction (though 388 men were moved as part of the voluntary National Service Scheme). Belgian refugees became workers, though they were often seen as \\"job stealers\\". Likewise, the use of Irish workers, because they were exempt from conscription, was another source of resentment.Beckett (2007), p 366 Worried about the impact of the dilution of labour caused by bringing external groups into the main labour pool, workers in some areas turned to strike action. The efficiency of major industries improved markedly during the war. For example, the Singer Clydebank sewing machine factory received over 5000 government contracts, and made 303 million artillery shells, shell components, fuzes, and airplane parts, as well as grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour force of 14,000 was about 70 percent female at war's end.Robert Bruce Davies, Peacefully working to conquer the world (Arno Press, 1976) p 170 =Energy= Energy was a critical factor for the British war effort. Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply. Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use. There were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico.Harold F. Williamson, The American Petroleum Industry: the Age of Energy 1899‚Äì1959 (1963) 2:267 The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German u-boats. Convoys and the construction of new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated American supplies to Britain, France and Italy.Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power (1991) pp 176‚Äì77 Fuel oil for the Royal Navy was the highest priority. In 1917, the Royal Navy consumed 12,500 tons a month, but had a supply of 30,000 tons a month from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, using their oil wells in Persia. Social change The Munitions Girls (1918), oil painting by Stanhope Forbes Variously throughout the war, serious shortage of able-bodied men (\\"manpower\\") occurred in the country, and women were required to take on many of the traditional male roles, particularly in the area of arms manufacture; though this was only significant in the later years of the war, since unemployed men were often prioritised by employers.Beckett (2007), pp 455‚Äì460 Women both found work in the munitions factories (as \\"munitionettes\\") despite initial trade union opposition, which directly helped the war effort, but also in the Civil Service, where they took men's jobs, releasing them for the front. The number of women employed by the service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to over 102,000 by 1921. The overall increase in female employment is estimated at , from 5.9 to , and female trade union membership increased from 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918‚Äîan increase of 160 percent. Beckett suggests that most of these were working class women going into work at a younger age than they would otherwise have done, or married women returning to work. This taken together with the fact that only 23 percent of women in the munitions industry were actually doing men's jobs, would limit substantially the overall impact of the war on the long-term prospects of the working woman. First World War poster When the government targeted women early in the war focused on extending their existing roles ‚Äì helping with Belgian refugees, for example‚Äîbut also on improving recruitment rates amongst men. They did this both through the so-called \\"Order of the White Feather\\" and through the promise of home comforts for the men while they were at the front. In , groups were set up and a campaign started to get women to help in agriculture and in , the Women's Land Army was set up. One goal was to attract middle-class women who would act as models for patriotic engagement in nontraditional duties. However the uniform of the Women's Land Army included male overalls and trousers, which sparked debate on the propriety of such cross-dressing. The government responded with rhetoric that explicitly feminized the new roles.Susan R. Grayzel, \\"Nostalgia, Gender, and The Countryside: Placing the 'Land Girl' in First World War Britain,\\" Rural History (1999) 10#2 pp 155‚Äì170. In 1918, the Board of Trade estimated that there were 148,000 women in agricultural employment, though a figure of nearly 260,000 has also been suggested. The war also caused a split in the British suffragette movement, with the mainstream, represented by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel's Women's Social and Political Union, calling a 'ceasefire' in their campaign for the duration of the war. In contrast, more radical suffragettes, like the Women's Suffrage Federation run by Emmeline's other daughter, Sylvia, continued their (at times violent) struggle. Women were also allowed to join the armed forces in a non-combatant role and by the end of the War 80,000 women had joined the armed forces in auxiliary roles such as nursing and cooking. Following the war, millions of returning soldiers were still not entitled to vote. This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could be seen to be withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males as long as they were over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers,Fraser (1918) though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.Law (1997), p 115 The new coalition government of 1918 charged itself with the task of creating a \\"land fit for heroes\\", from a speech given in Wolverhampton by David Lloyd George on 1918, where he stated \\"What is our task? To make Britain a fit country for heroes to live in.\\"The Times, 1918. More generally, the war has been credited, both during and after the conflict, with removing some of the social barriers that had pervaded Victorian and Edwardian Britain. Regional conditions The War had a profound influence upon rural areas, as the U-boat blockade required the government to take full control of the food chain, as well as agricultural labour. Cereal production was a high priority, and the Corn Production Act 1917 guaranteed prices, regulated wage rates, and required farmers to meet efficiency standards. The government campaigned heavily for turning marginal land into cropland.Pamela Horn, Rural Life in England in the First World War (St. Martin's Press, 1984)Peter E. Dewey, \\"British Farming Profits and Government Policy During the First World War.\\" Economic History Review (1984) 37#3 pp: 373‚Äì390.Peter E. Dewey, British Agriculture in the First World War (1989) The Women's Land Army brought in 23,000 young women from the towns and cities to milk cows, pick fruit and otherwise replace the men who joined the services.Bonnie White, The Women's Land Army in First World War Britain (2014) More extensive use of tractors and machinery also replaced farm labourers. However, there was a shortage of both men and horses on the land by late 1915. County War Agricultural Executive Committees reported that the continued removal of men was undercutting food production because of the farmers' belief that operating a farm required a set number of men and horses.Bonnie White, \\"Feeding the war effort: agricultural experiences in First World War Devon, 1914‚Äì17,\\" Agricultural History Review (2010) 58#1 pp 95‚Äì112. Kenneth Morgan argues that, \\"the overwhelming mass of the Welsh people cast aside their political and industrial divisions and threw themselves into the war with gusto.\\" Intellectuals and ministers actively promoted the war spirit. With 280,000 men enrolled in the services (14% of the population), the proportionate effort in Wales outstripped both England and Scotland. However Adrian Gregory points out that the Welsh coal miners, while officially supporting the war effort, refused the government request to cut short their vacation time. After some debate, the miners agreed to extend the working day. ch 1 Scotland's distinctive characteristics have attracted significant attention from scholars.C. M. M. Macdonald and E. W. McFarland, eds, Scotland and the Great War (Edinburgh: Tuckwell Press, 1999) Daniel Coetzee shows it supported the war effort with widespread enthusiasm.Daniel Coetzee, \\"Measures of enthusiasm: new avenues in quantifying variations in voluntary enlistment in Scotland, August 1914 ‚Äì December 1915\\", Local Population Studies, Spring 2005, Issue 74, pp. 16‚Äì35. Casualties Poster for a fundraising event in support of Welsh troops by Frank Brangwyn In the post war publication Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914‚Äì1920 (The War Office, ), the official report lists 908,371 'soldiers' as being either killed in action, dying of wounds, dying as prisoners of war or missing in action in the World War. (This is broken down into Britain and its colonies 704,121; British India 64,449; Canada 56,639; Australia 59,330; New Zealand 16,711; South Africa 7,121.) Listed separately were the Royal Navy (including the Royal Naval Air Service until 31 March 1918) war dead and missing of 32,287 and the Merchant Navy war dead of 14,661. The figures for the Royal Flying Corps and the nascent Royal Air Force were not given in the War Office report. A second publication, Casualties and Medical Statistics (1931), the final volume of the Official Medical History of the War, gives British Empire Army losses by cause of death.Mitchell (1931), p 12 The total losses in combat from 1914 to 1918 were 876,084, which included 418,361 killed, 167,172 died of wounds, 113,173 died of disease or injury, 161,046 missing presumed dead and 16,332 died as a prisoner of war. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission lists 888,246 imperial war dead (excluding the dominions, which are listed separately). This figure includes identified burials and those commemorated by name on memorials; there are an additional 187,644 unidentified burials from the Empire as a whole.Commonwealth War Graves Commission Annual Report 2010-2011, page 45. The civilian death rate exceeded the prewar level by 292,000, which included 109,000 deaths due to food shortages and 183,577 from Spanish flu. The 1922 War Office report detailed the deaths of 1,260 civilians and 310 military personnel due to air and sea bombardment the home islands.Gilbert (1994), pp 674‚Äì678 Losses at sea were 908 civilians and 63 fisherman killed by U-boat attacks.Gilbert (1994), p 78 With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.I. F. W. Beckett and K. R. Simpson, eds. A Nation in Arms: a Social Study of the British Army in the First World War (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1985) p. 11.R. A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds, The New Penguin History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 2001), p. 426. At times Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the Battle of Loos, where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. Some areas, like the thinly populated Island of Lewis and Harris suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain. Clydeside shipyards and the engineering shops of west-central Scotland became the most significant centre of shipbuilding and arms production in the Empire. In the Lowlands, particularly Glasgow, poor working and living conditions led to industrial and political unrest.J. Buchanan, Scotland (Langenscheidt, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 49. Legacy and memory The horrors of the Western Front as well as Gallipoli and Mesopotamia were seared into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century. To a large extent the understanding of the war in popular culture focused on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Historian A. J. P. Taylor argued, \\"The Somme set the picture by which future generations saw the First World War: brave helpless soldiers; blundering obstinate generals; nothing achieved.\\" Images of trench warfare became iconic symbols of human suffering and endurance. The post-war world had many veterans who were maimed or damaged by shell shock. In 1921 1,187,450 men were in receipt of pensions for war disabilities, with a fifth of these having suffered serious loss of limbs or eyesight, paralysis or lunacy.Chris Wrigley, \\"The Impact of the First World War,\\" in Chris Wrigley, ed., A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain (2003) pp 502, 512 The war was a major economic catastrophe as Britain went from being the world's largest overseas investor to being its biggest debtor, with interest payments consuming around 40 percent of the national budget. Inflation more than doubled between 1914 and its peak in 1920, while the value of the Pound Sterling fell by 61.2 percent. Reparations in the form of free German coal depressed the local industry, precipitating the 1926 General Strike. During the war British private investments abroad were sold, raising . However, new investment also took place during the war. The net financial loss was therefore approximately ; less than two years investment compared to the pre-war average rate and more than replaced by 1928.Taylor (2001), p 123 Material loss was \\"slight\\": the most significant being 40 percent of the British merchant fleet sunk by German U-boats. Most of this was replaced in 1918 and all immediately after the war.Taylor (2001), p 122 The military historian Correlli Barnett has argued that \\"in objective truth the Great War in no way inflicted crippling economic damage on Britain\\" but that the war only \\"crippled the British psychologically\\" (emphasis in original).Barnett (2002), pp 424‚Äì426 Less concrete changes include the growing assertiveness of the Dominions within the British Empire. Battles such as Gallipoli for Australia and New Zealand,Beaumont (1995), pp 125‚Äì148 and Vimy Ridge for Canada led to increased national pride and a greater reluctance to remain subordinate to London.Pierce (1992), p 5 These battles were often portrayed favourably in these nations' propaganda as symbolic of their power during the war. The war released pent-up indigenous nationalism, as populations tried to take advantage of the precedent set by the introduction of self-determination in eastern Europe. Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919‚Äì21), India (1919), Egypt (1919‚Äì23), Palestine (1920‚Äì21) and Iraq (1920) at a time when they were supposed to be demilitarising.Beckett (2007), p 564 Nevertheless, Britain's only territorial loss came in Ireland, where the delay in finding a resolution to the home rule issue, along with the 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals, and led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919.Hennessey (1998), p 220 Further change came in 1919. With the Treaty of Versailles, London took charge of an additional and new subjects.Ferguson (2004), p 315 The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were redistributed to the Allies (including Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) as League of Nations mandates, with Britain gaining control of Palestine and Transjordan, Iraq, parts of Cameroon and Togo, and Tanganyika.Olson (1996), p 658 Indeed, the British Empire reached its territorial peak after the settlement.

It was written by Gerard J. Holzmann and others in the original Unix group of the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs, beginning in 1980. The software has been available freely since 1991, and continues to evolve to keep pace with new developments in the field. Tool Systems to be verified are described in Promela (Process Meta Language), which supports modeling of asynchronous distributed algorithms as non-deterministic automata (SPIN stands for \\"Simple Promela Interpreter\\"). Properties to be verified are expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, which are negated and then converted into B√ºchi automata as part of the model-checking algorithm. In addition to model- checking, SPIN can also operate as a simulator, following one possible execution path through the system and presenting the resulting execution trace to the user. Unlike many model-checkers, SPIN does not actually perform model- checking itself, but instead generates C sources for a problem-specific model checker. This technique saves memory and improves performance, while also allowing the direct insertion of chunks of C code into the model. SPIN also offers a large number of options to further speed up the model-checking process and save memory, such as: *partial order reduction; *state compression; *bitstate hashing (instead of storing whole states, only their hash code is remembered in a bitfield; this saves a lot of memory but voids completeness); *weak fairness enforcement. Since 1995, (approximately) annual SPIN workshops have been held for SPIN users, researchers, and those generally interested in model checking.

Before he assumed the name \\"Khun Sa\\" in 1976, he was known primarily by his Chinese name, Zhang Qifu (ÂºµÂ•áÂ§´). He was born in Hpa Hpeung village, in the Loi Maw ward of Mongyai, Northern Shan State, Burma.Doi Mae Salong In his early life Khun Sa received military equipment and training from both the Kuomintang and Burmese Army before claiming to fight for the independence of Shan State and going on to establish his own independent territory. He was dubbed the \\"Opium King\\" in Myanmar due to his massive opium smuggling operations in the Golden Triangle, where he was the dominant opium warlord from approximately 1976‚Äì1996. Although the American ambassador to Thailand called him \\"the worst enemy the world has\\", he successfully co-opted the support of both the Thai and Burmese governments at various times. After the American Drug Enforcement Administration uncovered and broke the link between Khun Sa and his foreign brokers, he \\"surrendered\\" to the Burmese government in 1996, disbanding his army and moving to Yangon with his wealth and mistresses. After his retirement some of his forces refused to surrender and continued fighting the government, but he engaged in \\"legitimate\\" business projects, especially mining and construction. He died in 2007 at the age of 73. Today, his children are prominent business people in Myanmar. Biography =Early life= Khun Sa was born to a Chinese father and a Shan mother. For the first forty years of his life he was primarily known by his Chinese name, Zhang Qifu. When he was three years old, his father died. His mother married a local tax collector, but two years later she died as well.Lintner (2007) 1 He was raised largely by his Chinese grandfather, who was the headman of the village in which he was born, Loi Maw.Lintner (1999) 525 The Chinese side of his family had been living in Shan State since the 18th century.Smith 95 He received no formal education but had military training as a soldier with Chinese Nationalist forces that had fled into Burma after the victory of Mao‚Äôs Communists in 1949. Although his stepbrothers were sent to missionary schools, the only formal education that Khun Sa received was as a boy, when he spent a few years as a Buddhist novitiate, and for the rest of his life he remained functionally illiterate.Lintner (2007) 1 In the early 1950s he received some basic military training from the Kuomintang, which had fled into the border regions of Burma from Yunnan upon its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. He formed his first independent band of young men when he was sixteen, and when his organization grew to several hundred men he became independent of the Kuomintang.Fuller After establishing his independence he frequently switched sides between the government and various rebel armies, as the situation suited him. In 1963 he re-formed his army into a local \\"Ka Kwe Ye\\" (\\"Home guard\\") unit, under the control of the northeast command of the Burmese army, which was based in nearby Lashio. In return for fighting local Shan rebels, the government allowed him to use their land and roads to grow and trade opium and heroin. By allowing them to be financed by opium production, the Burmese government hoped that these local militia units could be self-supporting. Unfortunately, many government-supported warlords, including Khun Sa, used their profits from the opium trade to buy large supplies of military equipment from the black markets in Laos and Thailand, and were soon better equipped than the Burmese army. By the late 1960s Khun Sa was one of the most important and powerful militia leaders in Shan state. He held an important pass in Loi Maw, restricting the movements of local communist rebels. During the period, while he was nominally supporting the Burmese government, he maintained contact with Kuomintang intelligence agents.Lintner (1999) 238, 256 Through the 1960s Khun Sa became one of Burma's most notorious drug traffickers.The Economist. He challenged the local dominance of the Kuomintang remnants in Shan State, but in 1967 he was decisively defeated in a battle involving both the Kuomintang and the Laotian army on the Thai-Burma-Laos border. In that battle he led a convoy of 500 men and 300 mules into Laos, but the convoy was ambushed by Kuomintang forces en route. As the battle was going on, the Laotian army (which was also involved in the opium/heroin trade) bombed the battleground and stole the opium.Lintner (2007) 1‚Äì2 This defeat demoralized him and his forces.Lintner (1999) 525‚Äì526 The Laotian army continued to ambush his mule trains for the next few years,The Economist. and his military strength declined. In 1969, delegates from a local ethnic rebel group, the Shan State Army, began to hold secret talks with Khun Sa, attempting to persuade him to change sides and join them. He expressed interest, but details of the meeting were discovered by the Burmese army, and he was arrested On October 29, 1969 at Heho Airport in Taunggyi while returning from a business trip in Tachilek, near the Thai border.Lintner (1999) 260‚Äì261 After his capture he was charged with high treason for his contacts with the rebels (but not for drug trafficking, which he had government permission to do), and he was imprisoned in Mandalay.Lintner (2007) 2 While imprisoned Khun Sa read Sun Tzu's the Art of War and Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms, after which he developed a political philosophy that he exercised later in life: ‚ÄúIn politics there are no lifelong friends, and no lifelong foes... They change according to the gains and losses. A good leader must be able to take advantage of every change and utilize it.‚ÄùPetersen After Khun Sa's arrest his militia unit dissolved,Lintner (1999) 262 but his more loyal followers went underground, and in 1973 abducted two Soviet doctors from a hospital in Taunggyi, where they had been working. A division of soldiers from the Burmese army were tasked with rescuing the doctors, but failed. The doctors were ransomed for Khun Sa's freedom, and he was subsequently released in 1974. Khun Sa's release was secretly brokered by Thai General Kriangsak Chomanan. After his release Khun Sa maintained a good relationship with Chomanan, and in 1981 secretly contributed $50,000 US to support him in a Thai election campaign.Lintner (1999) 319 =Later life= Khun Sa in 1974 During the next two decades, from 1974‚Äì1994, Khun Sa became the dominant opium warlord in the Golden Triangle. The share of heroin sold in New York originating from the Golden Triangle rose from 5% to 80% during this period, and Khun Sa was responsible for 45% of that trade. The DEA assessed that Khun Sa's heroin was 90% pure, \\"the best in the business\\". During the height of his power, in the 1980s, Khun Sa controlled 70% of the opium production in Burma, and built a large-scale infrastructure of heroin refining factories to dominate the market for that drug. He may have once supplied a quarter of the world's heroin supply.Boyle He commanded 20,000 men, and his personal army was better armed than the Burmese military. His notoriety led the American government to put a $2 million bounty on him. The American diplomat to Thailand referred to him as \\"the worst enemy the world has\\". After his release Khun Sa went underground, and in 1976 rejoined and reformed his forces in Ban Hin Taek, in northern Thailand, close to the border with Burma. Soon after he began to reform his forces he adopted the Shan name \\"Khun Sa\\"Lintner (1999) 526 (literally \\"Prince Prosperous\\") for the first time. He renamed his group the \\"Shan United Army\\", began to claim that he was fighting for Shan autonomy against the Burmese government, and told international reporters that his people only grew drugs to pay for clothes and food. In 1977 he offered to take his territory's entire opium crop off the black market by selling it to the American government, but his offer was rejected. Although Khun Sa was not the mastermind of the local drug trade, he controlled areas where drugs were grown and refined. The owners of the local heroin refineries were from Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and paid Khun Sa in exchange for the protection of his army. American government workers, who visited Khun Sa's compound in 1977 to negotiate with him, believed that the Thai government tolerated his presence on Thailand's northwestern border in order for his army to serve as a buffer between them and more radical revolutionary groups active in Laos and Burma at the time.Lintner (1999) 313‚Äì314 After a combined Thai/Kuomintang army defeated entrenched Communist rebels in Northwest Thailand 1981, American officials began to pressure the Thai government to expel Khun Sa. In July 1981, Thai authorities announced a 50,000 baht ($2,000 US) bounty on his head. In August this was raised to 500,000 baht, \\"valid until 30 Sept. 1982\\". In October 1981 a 39-man unit of Thai Rangers and local rebel guerillas attempted to assassinate Khun Sa at the insistence of the US Drug Enforcement Administration. The attempt failed, and almost the entire unit was wiped out.HailLintner (1999) 321‚Äì322 In January 1982 a 1,000-man force of the Thai Army appeared at the borders of his base area. The Thai force consisted of Thai rangers from Pak Thong Chai, local paramilitary border police from Tak, and several airplanes and helicopter gunships.Lintner (1999) 321‚Äì333Sumondis, Prateepchaikul, and Kanwanich The battle lasted for fourdays, with heavy casualties on both sides. At the conclusion of the battle Khun Sa was forced to retreat back into Burma. Within a year of losing his base in Thailand, Khun Sa rebuilt his army, defeated a local Burmese rebel group along the Burmese border between Shan State and Northwest Thailand, and took control of the region. He relocated his base of operations to the border town of Homein, established a local heroin-refining industry, and resumed a working relationship with the Burmese military and intelligence services, who again tolerated his presence in return for fighting other ethnic and communist rebels.Lintner (1999) 323‚Äì324 He maintained a cordial relationship with the highest-ranking Burmese general in the region, Maung Aye, and established relationships with many foreign socialites and business people, including Lady and Lord Brockett, and James \\"Bo\\" Gritz. In 1984 his forces bombed the fortified residence of his rival, Li Wenhuan, in Chiang Mai.Lintner (1999) 508, 526 His organization maintained a trade organization in the government- held city of Taunggyi and re-established cordial relations with the Thai intelligence service after relocating to Burma. In 1985, Khun Sa merged his Shan United Army with another rebel group, the \\"Tai Revolutionary Council\\" of Moh Heng, a faction of the Shan United Revolutionary Army (SURA), forming the Mong Tai Army (MTA). Through that alliance he gained control of a 150-mile Thai-Burma border area from his base at Ho Mong, a village near Mae Hong Son, to Mae Sai.Smith 343 When the Americans donated several million dollars to the Burmese government for \\"drug suppression\\" in 1987, the Burmese military fabricated reports, leaked to the Thai press, that they had attacked and defeated Khun Sa in battles involving thousands of Burmese and Thai soldiers and several F-5E jets. However, these reports were completely false, and no action was taken against him. In reality, the Burmese and Thai governments were cooperating with him to build a highway into the region that he controlled.Lintner (1999) 378‚Äì379 The Burmese army did conduct anti-narcotics operations at the time in many other areas of Burma, but the area controlled by Khun Sa was one of the few areas not targeted.Smith 321 In 1988, Khun Sa was interviewed by Australian journalist Stephen Rice, who had crossed the border from Thailand into Burma illegally. Khun Sa offered to sell his entire heroin crop to the Australian Government for A$50m a year (paid in either cash or agricultural aid) for the next eight years, a move that would have immediately destroyed half the world's heroin supply. The Australian Government rejected the offer, with Senator Gareth Evans declaring: \\"The Australian Government is simply not in the business of paying criminals to refrain from criminal activity.\\"Parliament of Australia In September 1989, when American photojournalist Karen Petersen interviewed the General for People magazine at his camp in Ner Mone, Shan State, he claimed he had a total army of 12,000 men. Soon thereafter, in January 1990 Khun Sa was convicted in absentia by an American federal grand jury on drug trafficking charges. Following his indictment, he was interviewed by Canadian journalist Patricia Elliott at his base, accompanied by photojournalist Subin Kheunkaew, for the Bangkok Post.Elliott \\"How 'Prince of Death' Sees Bright Future for Shan\\" At the time he was acting as head of a coalition of Shan rebel forces, the Mong Tai Army (MTA), a force he then claimed consisted of 18,000 troops, a reserve of 5,000, and a local militia numbering 8,000.Elliott \\"Peaceful Village Home to Liberation Struggle\\" At this time he named his price for opium eradication as US$210 million in UN assistance, US$265 million in foreign investment and US$89.5 million in private aid for a program of crop substitution, education, and health care. The offer was rejected as blackmail by US authorities;Elliott \\"A Man Who Only Wants the Right to 'Enjoy His Own Garden'...at a Price\\". and, rather than accepting his offer, the American government placed a $2 million dollar bounty on him. He imposed a 40% tax on all opium growing, refining, and trafficking in return for protection from other warlords and the Myanmar government, but refused to discuss his total opium income with international reporters. To protect against air raids, he amassed a supply of locally made rockets and Surface-to-air-missiles purchased in Laos. =Retirement and death= Khun Sa's forces at Ner Mone, Shan State, 1990. In the 1990s Khun Sa's influence and power in the region declined. Part of this was due to the opening of new trade routes for heroin that ran from Yunnan to ports in southeastern China, which reduced his importance as a middleman for the drug along the Thai border. Other drug trafficking routes opened up to India, Laos, and Cambodia, which Khun Sa did not control.Lintner (1999) 399, 402 In the early 1990s his organization began to be challenged militarily by another nominally independent ethnic rebel organization in northern Myanmar, the United Wa State Army. This conflict put pressure on his leadership. Khun Sa's surrender to the Burmese government coincided with, and may have been motivated by, a loss of support from other Shan leaders.BBC After his front man within the Mong Tai Army, his longtime subordinate, Chairman Moh Heng, died of cancer in 1991, his control over the organization began to weaken. After Moh Heng's death he called a Shan \\"parliament\\", attracting hundreds of representatives from across the region. At this meeting he declared the creation of an independent Shan State, with himself as president. Many of his rivals from within the Mong Tai Army refused to accept his leadership, claiming that he was using the independence movement primarily as a front for his drug running operations, and formed a rival Shan organization, the \\"Shan State National Army\\". Khun Sa exported his heroin through a network of underworld contacts and brokers based in Thailand, Yunnan, Macao, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Once he sold his products to these dealers, he had no control of where they were transported. Some of his business associates believed that he was only a front man for underworld Chinese drug interests, and many were terrified of him. By 1995 the DEA managed to discover and break the link between Khun Sa and his foreign brokers. Khun Sa's income then began to decline, and he began to consider retirement. In public the Burmese military claimed that they wanted to hang Khun Sa. They conducted small raids against him, and they carried out public bonfires of \\"heroin\\" (largely stones and grass). Despite the Burmese leadership's public attitude towards Khun Sa, they understood that he had long controlled Burma's most lucrative export crop (estimated at $600 million US per year in 1997),Lintner (1999) 403 and by the 1990s he had co-opted many of the most high-ranking military leaders in the country. By 1996 they made a secret agreement for Khun Sa to surrender to the Burmese government, under the understanding that he would receive government protection and that he would not be extradited. Khun Sa surrendered to the Burmese government in January 1996, gave up control of his army, and moved to Rangoon with a large fortune and four young Shan mistresses. Following Khun Sa's surrender, opium production in the Golden Triangle declined (this shift coincided with a dramatic rise in opium production in Afghanistan). During his retirement he became a prominent local businessman, with investments in Yangon, Mandalay and Taunggyi. After his retirement he described himself as \\"a commercial real estate agent with a foot in the construction industry\\". He ran a large ruby mine, and invested in a new highway running from Yangon to Mandalay.Lintner (1999) 412 While living in Yangoon, Khun Sa maintained a low profile. His movements and communications with the outside world were restricted by the Burmese government, and his activities were monitored by Burmese intelligence. Following Khun Sa's retirement and the voluntary disbandment of his private army, many of his followers joined local militias controlled by the Burmese army. Others, who had believed that he was a Shan patriot, were devastated and refused to accept the ceasefire. They went underground and continued to fight the Burmese army under the name of the \\"Shan State Army - South\\". The Burmese army somewhat disrupted the local opium trade, and the largest opium producer in the Golden Triangle became the United Wa State Army. Khun Sa died on 26 October 2007 in Yangon at the age of 73. The cause of death was not known, though he had suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure,BBC and heart disease. He was cremated four days after his death. His remains were buried at Yayway Cemetery, North Okkalapa, Yangon, Myanmar.Find a Grave Before his death he had decided not to be buried in Shan state, due to fears that his tomb would be vandalized or destroyed. Soon after he died, in November 2007, a memorial was held for him in Khun Sa's former stronghold in Thailand, Thoed Thai, close to the Myanmar border. Asked why they honoured Khun Sa, the local people said that he helped the town to develop: he built the first paved roads in the area, the first school, and a well-equipped, 60 bed hospitalUnkovich and Earlystaffed by Chinese doctors. He was building a hydro power plant, but after his departure construction on that project was halted. He also built an 18-hole golf course for foreign visitors and a functional water and electrical infrastructure. The local Thai authorities ensured that the ceremony remained relatively simple. Family He was married to Nan Kyayon (died 1993) with whom he had eight children: five sons and three daughters. His children, listed in order of their birth, are: Nang Long (Khajit, ); Zarm Merng (Phajon ); Zarm Herng (Phathai, ); Nang Kang (Khanittha, ); Zarm Zeun (Phairote, ); Zarm Myat (Phaisarn, ); Nang Lek (n/a); and, Zarm Mya (Pitak, ). All of Khun Sa's children were educated abroad. As a reward for his retirement and relocation to Yangon, his children were allowed to run and operate business interests in Myanmar. At the time of his death, in 2007, his favorite son was running a hotel and casino in the border town of Tachilek, while one of his daughters was a well-established businesswoman in Mandalay. In 1989 he told Karen Petersen, a reporter for People magazine, that he also had a second wife in Bangkok. When he moved to Yangon he brought four young mistresses with him. All four were teenagers from Kengtung, in eastern Shan State. In popular culture Khun Sa is mentioned in Japanese manga and anime Black Lagoon, for his role on the drug trade in Southeast Asia as well as one of his subordinates being targeted by the NSA. Khun Sa is portrayed by Ric Young in the 2007 film American Gangster. Khun Sa is mentioned in Jo Nesb√∏'s Cockroaches, the second novel in the Harry Hole series.

It lies on the coast of the Firth of Forth at the mouth of the River Leven, north-east of the town of Kirkcaldy and east of Glenrothes. According to an estimate taken in 2008, Leven has a population of 8,850. The town forms part of the Levenmouth conurbation, which has a total population of 37,651.fifevoluntaryaction.org.uk  History  Carlow Hall The origin of the name \\"Leven\\" comes from the Pictish word for \\"flood\\". The nearby Loch Leven, being the flood lake, was the name given to both the river and town. A settlement is believed to have formed at the mouth of the River Leven very close to the area around Scoonie Brae with the discovery of the parish church of \\"scoyne\\". During the mid-11th century, Bishop Tuadal of St Andrews gifted the church of \\"scoyne\\" to the Culdees of Loch Leven. By the end of the 11th century, the village along with the church were acquired by Bishop Robert of St Andrews following the decline of culdeen faith. The first mention of the current town was made in the middle of the 15th century, according to two separate records referring to the town's name as \\"levynnis-mouth\\". This contained information about the urgent need for repair work at the town's monastery and Georgie Durie, a local estate owner, becoming the keeper at the harbour. In 1854 the Leven Railway opened, linking the town with Thornton Junction on the Edinburgh - Aberdeen main line. This helped it to become a tourist resort popular with visitors from the west of Scotland, and particularly Glasgow. Later in the 19th century the Leven Railway became part of a loop line of the North British Railway linking Thornton Junction and Leuchars Junction via St Andrews. The railway between Leven and St. Andrews closed in 1965. The railway between Leven and Thornton Junction closed to freight in 1966 and passengers in 1969. In 2019 a scheme was approved to re- open the town's railway station. Until then, the nearest station is Markinch railway station. The ecclesiastical and civil parish of Scoonie included the town of Leven.  Leisure and tourism  Leven beach Silverburn Park, 2012 Tourism is a major economic activity in and around Leven. There are several large caravan parks in and around the town, in addition to a number of hotels and guest houses. The neighbouring villages of Lundin Links and Lower Largo have over 50 high quality self-catering properties available for visitors. The coast and the long sandy beaches are the main visitor draw. Leven has an attractive beach promenade with playparks and other facilities including an indoor Kids Action Zone. The promenade is part of the Fife Coastal Path that stretches for over from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Tay. There are also popular family facilities and walks in the large parks at Letham Glen and Silverburn. The former includes a crafts centre and woodland walks, while the latter has attractive gardens and coastal views. Golf is also a major draw with two courses at Scoonie and Leven Links and another within easy walking distance at Lundin Links. Leven Links has been used as a qualifying course for the Open Championship when it is held at St Andrews, the \\"home of golf\\" only to the north. There are also numerous bowls clubs in and around the town. A heritage railway has also been established near the Burnmill industrial estate, alongside the now disused Leven-Thornton branch line. With trains running along the yard for half a mile, between April and October with a Santa special in mid-December. The Fife Heritage Railway is the first of its kind in Fife since the closure of Lochty Private Railway in 1992. The railway completed its first steam engine in August 2016. Levenmouth Leisure Centre, at the start of the promenade, is an all-weather attraction with a large, modern indoor swimming pool and sports facilities. The town also boasts its own popular 374-seat cinema, The Kino, which has ongoing programmes of new release feature films and hosts regular events, such as concerts, opera, and ballet. History enthusiasts can find out about the area's past at the Heritage Centre in neighbouring Methil, only a 15-minute walk from Leven town centre. The town centre is the main shopping centre for a wide area with a number of national chain supermarkets and retailers as well as award-winning independent local retailers. It also has a large number of restaurants and cafes.  Economic activity  Levenmouth suffers from poor connections to the rail and main road network of Central Scotland, particularly since the closure of the last railway link in 1969, which came at the same time as the collapse of coal mining. The knock-on effect virtually sealed the fate of Methil as a major port on the East of Scotland. There has been a number of unsuccessful attempts to restore a passenger rail connection to Leven although local campaigns still press the case for reopening stations. However, a steam railway preservation group, the Kingdom of Fife Railway Preservation Society, have expressed interest in reopening the railway as a heritage rail line. However, there are good bus links to the main railhead at Kirkcaldy () and regular express bus services to the pretty resort villages of the neighbouring East Neuk and St Andrews. A new bus station has recently been built in the centre of the town at the foot of the High Street opposite the Leisure Centre. The main road through Fife, the A92, bypasses this area of Fife, the 4th largest conurbation, whereas Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes all have good road and rail connections. Leven is linked to Kirkcaldy by the A915 Standing Stone Road and Methil to Kirkcaldy through Dysart and East/West Wemyss. It also has a fast road link to Glenrothes on the A915 that continues on to St Andrews. Wind turbine under construction at Methil Very little remains in the way of major employment since the closure of the coal mining industry. The major employers now is the drinks manufacturer Diageo which has its main bottling plant in the town, and one of the largest distilleries in the world at Cameron Bridge, near Windygates, supermarket companies Sainsbury's, Lidl and Aldi which trade from large stores located throughout the town. There is hopefully some light on the horizon in the proposed Fife Energy Park (this is operating now 2008, they produce wind turbines) which is to utilise the former oil-rig building yard in Methil which was itself built on the former Wellesley Colliery. On the north side of the Forth, there is talk of starting a ferry service to Edinburgh, and this may help to revitalise the area and increase house prices, which at the moment are among the lowest in Scotland.  Education  Currently, the town is home to three primary schools. Two of which are non-denominational - Mountfleurie and Parkhill and the other being denominational - St Agatha's. Parkhill Primary School which serves the centre of the town opened in 1910, initially as an infant school before accepting primary school pupils in 1957. Mountfleurie Primary School, on the other hand, opened in 1957 with an infant department in 1974. The school also has a speech and language class which officially started in 1990. St Agatha's RC Primary School which dates from 1975, following a re-location from Methil, Fife has a catchment area stretching from East Wemyss to Lower Largo. For Secondary schooling, most children within Leven will go to Levenmouth Academy. Previously, students would attend either Kirkland or Buckhaven high schools but these schools were merged to form Levenmouth Academy.

Lepaute predicted the return of Halley's Comet by calculating the timing of a solar eclipse and constructing a group of catalogs for the stars. The asteroid 7720 Lepaute is named in her honour, as is the lunar crater Lepaute. She was also a member of the Scientific Academy of B√©ziers. Biography Nicole-Reine Lepaute was born on 5 January 1723 in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris as the daughter of Jean Etable, valet in the service of Louise √âlisabeth d'Orl√©ans. Her father had worked for the royal family for a long time, both in the service of the duchess de Berry and her sister Louise. She was the sixth of nine children. As a child she was described as precocious and intelligent, being mostly self taught. She stayed up all night \\"devouring\\" books and read every book in the library, with Jerome Lalande saying of her once that even as a child \\"she had too much spirit not to be curious\\". In August 1749, she married Jean-Andr√© Lepaute, who was a royal clockmaker in the Luxembourg Palace. He quickly became famous all over Europe for his exceptional work.  Early career  Nicole Lepaute constructed a clock with an astronomical function together with her spouse. The clock was constructed on her suggestion, and she also participated in its construction. The clock was presented to the French Academy of Science in 1753, where it was inspected and approved by J√©r√¥me Lalande. After completing the clock with her husband, she worked with both him and Lalande on a book titled \\"Traite d'horlogerie (Treatise of Clockmaking) that was published in 1775 under her husband's name. Though she did not receive authorship, Lalande sang her praises later, saying, \\"Madame Lepaute computed for this book a table of numbers of oscillations for pendulums of different lengths, or the lengths for each given number of vibrations, from that of 18 lignes, that does 18000 vibrations per hour, up to that of 3000 leagues.\\"  Halley's Comet  J√©r√¥me Lalande recommended her along with the mathematician Alexis Clairaut to calculate the predicted return of Halley's Comet, as well as to calculate the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn of the Halley's comet. The team worked on the calculations for more than six months straight, barely stopping for food. In November 1758, the team presented their conclusion that the comet would arrive on 13 April 1759. They were almost correct, as the comet arrived on 13 March 1759. As a result of their calculations, this was the first time scientists had successfully predicted when the comet would cross the perihelion, i.e. the point of the comet orbit closest to the Sun. Clairault did not recognize her work at all in his work, which upset Lalande who considered Lepaute the \\"most distinguished female French astronomer ever.\\" J√©r√¥me Lalande acknowledged her help in an article.  Later mathematical accomplishments  In 1759, she was again a part of Lalande's team and worked with him to calculate the ephemeris of the transit of Venus. It is not documented what should be attributed to her personally, but in 1761, she was acknowledged by being inducted as an honorary member of the distinguished Scientific Academy of B√©ziers. Lalande also collaborated with Lepaute for fifteen years on the Academy of Science's annual guides for astronomers and navigators by developing ephemerides: tables that predict the location of the stars on each day of the year, and after her death, wrote a brief biography about her contributions to astronomy. In 1762, Lepaute calculated the exact time of a solar eclipse that occurred on 1 April 1764. She wrote an article in which she gave a map of the eclipse's extent in 15-minute intervals across Europe and predicted the time and percentage each are in Europe would experience. The article was published in Connaissance des Temps (Knowledge of the times). She also created a group of catalogs of the stars which were useful for the future of astronomy. She calculated the ephemeris of the Sun, the Moon and the planets for the years 1774‚Äì1784.  Personal life  While childless herself, she adopted her husband's nephew, Joseph Lepaute Dagelet, a future member of the French Academy of Science, in 1768. She trained him in astronomy and advanced mathematics so well that he became a math professor at the French Military School at age 26 before being elected deputy astronomer eight years later in 1785 at the French Royal Academy of Sciences. Nicole Lepaute took care of her terminally ill husband from 1767 until her death in Paris on 6 December 1788. She had gone blind herself just a few short months before.

Operational control of global courier activities is exercised through USTRANSCOM's Defense Courier Division (TCJ3-C). The division oversees and synchronizes activity of 18 courier stations worldwide to service over six thousand accounts. Major accounts include the White House, the Department of Defense, the State Department, other federal agencies, authorized government contractors, and allied nations. The DCS directly supports the President, Unified and Specified COCOMs, joint military operations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. allies, State Department, and other federal agencies. The DCS was formerly the Armed Forces Courier Service (ARFCOS) but was reorganized and renamed in 1985 after the Walker spy case.  History  Before the establishment of the courier service, American ship captains and selected American travellers were used to carry sealed packages of mail. Later these individuals, called \\"Bearers of Dispatches,\\" were augmented by a small group of Foreign Service Officers. With few modifications, this method of moving classified mail abroad continued until 1918 when the War Department established the Military Postal Express Service, consisting of 70 officers and enlisted soldiers, divided into an Overseas Service and a European Service. This continued until the early days of World War II when the War Department activated the Army Courier Service to move classified material between the War Department and various theatres of operation. Meanwhile, the Navy created the Officer Messenger Service and the Army Air Corps operated an Air Courier Service to move cryptographic materials. Frequently, couriers from all three services flew together on the routes. In November 1946, the War Department discontinued the Army Courier Service and established a \\"Security Courier Service,\\" which operated until 1949. At this time, certain courier stations were transferred to the newly created U.S. Air Force Security Courier Service. Then in 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed a review of courier operations which resulted in the establishment of an organization consisting of Army, Navy, and Air Force courier elements. The Armed Forces Courier Service (ARFCOS) was officially established on January 7, 1953. The military courier services were now consolidated. The ARFCOS charter was updated seven times over the next 30 years to reflect changes in the armed forces, military doctrine, and operational procedures. In the aftermath of the Walker-Whitworth espionage case (1985), the Secretary of Defense established a Security Commission‚Äîoften referred to as the Stillwell Commission‚Äîto review DoD security policies and practices. As part of its findings, the commission recommended a review and restructuring of ARFCOS and the DoD courier function. This resulted in publication of DoD Directive 5200.33, the revised charter for a new joint-service military command. Thus, the Defense Courier Service (DCS) was officially established on September 30, 1987. A revised concept for execution of the courier function emerged with the creation of the DCS. Key to this are the following major affiliations: *Under the DoD, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)). *Executive Agency responsibility for the DCS was transferred to the Air Force and, later, delegated to the Air Mobility Command (AMC). *On December 5, 1994, the DCS became a Direct Reporting unit to the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). Later, on October 1, 1998, DCS was relieved from its assignment to the USTRANSCOM and assigned once again to AMC. *More recently, on October 1, 2004, DCS was once again, reorganized under USTRANSCOM. The Gulf War provided the first real-world contingency deployment test of the DCS. Eight days after Iraqi tanks entered Kuwait, a seven-man DCS station was deployed to HQ, Central Command in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. By the end of the Gulf War, DCS couriers had provided over one million pounds of command, control, and intelligence material. Since 2004, Defense Courier Service increasingly has been integrated into USTRANSCOM. This process began when Program Budget Decision (PBD) 410, dated December 5, 2003, directed the realignment of Defense Courier Service (DCS) from Air Mobility Command (AMC) to U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). On October 1, 2004, DCS was aligned as a Functional Component Command (FCC) under the USTRANSCOM Director of Operations (TCJ3). On May 16, 2005, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) approved a proposal to eliminate the DCS command billet and integrate the functions of the DCS headquarters staff into USTRANSCOM. On November 15, 2005, the Defense Courier Division (TCJ3-C) assumed operational control of worldwide defense courier stations and continues to synchronize the defense courier related activities of the USTRANSCOM staff.

He served as the Warden there for a period of time. Alston, George Cyprian. \\"Edward Bocking.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 15 August 2018 Bocking became a monk in 1526. He was serving as the cellarer of Christ Church Priory, in Canterbury, when at the request of Archbishop William Warham, the prior sent him with others to access the credibility of Elizabeth Barton, \\"The Holy Maid of Kent\\", and her alleged divine revelations. Initially, she urged people to pray to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to undertake pilgrimages. After one of her usual trances she declared that the Blessed Virgin had directed her to enter some convent, and Archbishop William Warham arranged for her to enter the Benedictine convent of St. Selpulchre's near Canterbury. Bocking became her confessor. According to George C Alston, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, Bocking is said to have induced her to declare herself an inspired emissary for the overthrow of Protestantism and the prevention of the divorce of Queen Catherine. When the King began the process of obtaining an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and seizing control of the Church in England from Rome, Barton began to prophesy against the royal policies. Bocking caused a collection of her oracles, compiled under his direction to be widely circulated in manuscript. After the divorce of Queen Catherine and Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn in 1533, Cromwell had Elizabeth Barton arrested. Bocking was arrested in August 1533. In November, 1533 Bocking, Barton and others were made to mount a scaffold at St Paul's Cross to do public penance for promoting \\"superstition\\" and \\"disloyalty\\".Gasquet, Francis Aidan. Henry VIII and the English Monasteries, G. Bell, 1906, p. 40 They were then led through the streets to the Tower of London. Eustace Chapuys, Imperial ambassador for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, nephew of Queen Catherine of Aragon, noted that there was some difficulty in obtaining a conviction for treason, and the trial ended without a sentence. In January 1534, indictments were drawn for a second trial, but Thomas Cromwell decided instead to seek a bill of attainder. According to Francis Aidan Gasquet, since the names of those attainted was not immediately released, those who early had supported Barton, did not offer any objection, and some offered Cromwell money in exchange for pardons. Bocking and the others were not given an opportunity to address the charges; Parliament based its ruling on documentation supplied by the King's council. Bocking, together with Barton and six others, was hanged and beheaded for treason at Tyburn on 20 April 1534. His body was buried in the London cemetery of the Dominican Friars but his head was mounted above one of the city gates. Alston indicates that Barton's purported visions of declaiming against the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn were instigated and promoted by Bocking for his own purposes. Sidney Lee characterizes Barton's pronouncements as the result of an \\"hysterical disorder\\" and the undue influence of Bocking, who took advantage of it.Lee, Sidney. \\"Bocking\\", The Dictionary of National Biography, Vol. 2, (Leslie Stephen/George Smith, eds.), Oxford University Press, 1959, p. 750 Gasquet allows that she may herself have believed them, and that at a time when there was widespread opposition to the marriage, it was necessary for the Crown to discredit a visionary who had attracted a following. Alston says that Barton had retracted her statements, but Gasquet says that is based on information under the control of the government.

Early life Margaret Susan Ryder was born in 1924 in Leeds, and educated at Benenden School. When World War II broke out, she volunteered to the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, even though she was only 15, and she was soon assigned to the Polish section of the Special Operations Executive. In this role, Ryder's job was to drive SOE agents to the airfield where they would take off for their assignments in Europe. In 1943 she was posted to Tunisia and later to Italy. Year of birth According to her autobiography, Child of My Love, Ryder was born on 3 July 1923. This was repeated by The Daily Telegraph in her obituary in November 2000, adding that \\"Lady Ryder of Warsaw, better known as Sue Ryder, has died aged 77\\", as well as by the BBC and many other news sources. Her birth and death certificates both put the date one year later, on 3 July 1924, as does a plaque unveiled in honour of Sue Ryder and Leonard Cheshire in Cavendish Church in Suffolk. At the beginning of the war, Ryder volunteered to the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, even though she was only 15. To get in, she lied about her age and seems to have maintained the deception for the rest of her life. Post-war After the war was over, Ryder volunteered to do relief work, including some in Poland. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1957. In 1959 Ryder married Group Captain Leonard Cheshire VC (later Lord Cheshire), the founder of the major UK charity Leonard Cheshire Disability. Both Cheshire and Ryder were Roman Catholic converts. They received a joint Variety Club Humanitarian Award in 1975. Ryder was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1976. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1956 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, London. Charitable work In 1953 she established the Sue Ryder Foundation (later renamed Sue Ryder Care and in 2011 changed to Sue Ryder). The charity in 2011, now named simply Sue Ryder, thus reflects her importance and honours her life's work. Following her relief work in Europe after the Second World War, she first established a home for concentration camp survivors in Cavendish, Suffolk, that later provided nursing care for the elderly and disabled. Sue Ryder Care operates more than 80 homes worldwide, has about 500 high street charity shops and more than 8,000 volunteers. There is a Sue Ryder charity shop as far as the Ascension Islands. In 1998, Sue Ryder retired as a trustee and severed her links with Sue Ryder Care following a dispute with the other trustees, whom she accused of betraying her guiding principles.\\"Charity founder Baroness Ryder dies\\", BBC News, 2 November 2000. In February 2000, Ryder set up the Bouverie Foundation (since renamed The Lady Ryder of Warsaw Memorial Trust) to continue charitable work according to her ideals. Its work includes providing accommodation in Lourdes for handicapped pilgrims and their carers. Later life Ryder was made a life peer on 31 January 1979, being created Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, of Warsaw in Poland and of Cavendish in the County of Suffolk. In the House of Lords, Ryder was involved in debates about defence, drug abuse, housing, medical services, unemployment and race relations. Ryder continued to speak for Poland and when the Communist rule there collapsed, she arranged lorries of medical and food aid. In 1989 Ryder made an appeal through The Daily Telegraph to obtain more funding and collected ¬£40,000 through the Lady Ryder of Warsaw Appeals Fund. Ryder was particularly outspoken against rights of homosexuals. In a Lords debate for what became the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Ryder moved an amendment proposing a 'Restriction on custody of children by homosexuals'. Ryder's Amendment proposed to make it a criminal offence for \\"any homosexual man or woman, other than the natural parent, to have the care or custody of a child under the age of eighteen\\" and, where this was the case, for homosexuals to be liable on summary conviction to a maximum of six months imprisonment. Ryder withdrew the amendment when it received limited support from peers. Her husband was made a life peer in 1991, as Baron Cheshire, as a result of which Ryder obtained the additional title Baroness Cheshire. She died in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in 2000, aged 76.

Stela H., 1885 Brooklyn Museum Alfred Percival Maudslay (18 March 1850 ‚Äì 22 January 1931) was a British diplomat, explorer and archaeologist. He was one of the first Europeans to study Maya ruins. He also fully translated and annotated the best version of Bernal D√≠az del Castillo's Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a from the only original manuscript in 1908 for the Hakluyt Society, which was abridged in 1928. Early life Maudslay was born at Lower Norwood Lodge, near London, England into a wealthy engineering family descended from Henry Maudslay. He was educated at Royal Tunbridge Wells and Harrow School, and studied natural sciences at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1868‚Äì72, where he was acquainted with John Willis Clark, then Secretary of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society. After graduation, Maudslay enrolled in medical school but left because of acute bronchitis. Career After leaving Medical School, he moved to Trinidad, becoming private secretary to Governor William Cairns, and transferred with Cairns to Queensland. He subsequently moved to Fiji to work with Sir Arthur Gordon, its governor, and helped campaign against rebellious local tribes. Later he served as British consul in Tonga and Samoa. In February 1880, Maudslay resigned from the colonial service to pursue his own interests, having spent six years in the British Pacific colonies. He then joined his siblings in Calcutta during their round-the-world trip, returned to Britain in December, and then set out for Guatemala via British Honduras. In Guatemala, Maudslay began the major archaeological work for which he is now best remembered. He started at the Maya ruins of Quirigua and Copan where, with the help of Frank Sarg, he hired labourers to help clear and survey the remaining structures and artefacts. Sarg also introduced Maudslay to the newly found ruins in Tikal and to reliable guide Gorgonio L√≥pez. Maudslay was the first to describe the site of Yaxchil√°n. With Teobert Maler, Alfred Maudslay explored Chich√©n in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, \\"Biologia Centrali-Americana\\". In the course of his surveys, Maudslay pioneered many of the later archaeological techniques. He hired Italian expert Lorenzo Giuntini and technicians to make plaster casts of the carvings, while Gorgonio L√≥pez made casts of papier-m√¢ch√©. Artist Annie Hunter drew impressions of the casts before they were shipped to museums in England and the United States. Maudslay also took numerous detailed photographs ‚Äì dry plate photography was then a new technique ‚Äì and made copies of the inscriptions. All told, Maudslay made a total of six expeditions to Maya ruins. After 13 years of preparation, he published his findings in 1902 as a 5-volume compendium entitled Biologia Centrali-Americana, which contained numerous excellent drawings and photographs of Maya ruins, Maudslay's commentary, and an appendix on archaic calendars by Joseph Thompson Goodman. Maudslay also applied for permission to make a survey of Monte Alb√°n in Oaxaca but when he finally received permission in 1902, he could no longer finance the work with his own money. The firm of Maudslay, Sons and Field had gone bankrupt and reduced Maudslay's income. He unsuccessfully applied for funding from the Carnegie Institution. The Maudslays moved to San √Ångel near Mexico City for two years. In 1905, Maudslay began to translate the memoirs of Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, who had been a soldier in the troops of the conquistadors; he completed it in 1912. In 1907 the Maudslays moved permanently back to Britain. Maudslay become a President of the Royal Anthropological Institute 1911‚Äì12. He also chaired the 18th International Congress of Americanists in London in 1912. Personal life In 1892, Maudslay married US-born Anne Cary Morris, a granddaughter of Gouverneur Morris. For their honeymoon, the couple sailed to Guatemala via New York and San Francisco. There the Maudslays worked for two weeks on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. Their account was published in 1899 as A Glimpse at Guatemala. Annie Maudslay died in 1926. In 1928, Maudslay married widow Alice Purdon. In the following years he finished his memoirs, Life in the Pacific Fifty Years Ago. Alfred Maudslay died January 1931 in Hereford, England. He was buried in the crypt of Hereford Cathedral next to his first wife. Materials he collected are currently stored at Harvard and the British Museum.

(Joseph of Anchieta) (19 March 1534 ‚Äì 9 June 1597) was a Spanish Jesuit missionary to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in the second half of the 16th century. A highly influential figure in Brazil's history in the first century after its European discovery, Anchieta was one of the founders of S√£o Paulo in 1554 and of Rio de Janeiro in 1565. He is the first playwright, the first grammarian and the first poet born in the Canary Islands, and the father of Brazilian literature. Anchieta was also involved in the religious instruction and conversion to the Catholic faith of the Indian population. His efforts along with those of another Jesuit missionary, Manuel da N√≥brega, at Indian pacification were crucial to the establishment of stable colonial settlements in the colony. With his book Arte de gram√°tica da l√≠ngua mais usada na costa do Brasil, Anchieta became the first person to provide an orthography to the Old Tupi language most commonly spoken by the indigenous people of Brazil. Anchieta is commonly known as \\"the Apostle of Brazil\\". He was canonized by Pope Francis on 3 April 2014. He was the second native of the Canary Islands, after Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur,El Papa convierte hoy al Padre Anchieta en santo also a missionary to Latin America, declared a saint by the Catholic Church. Anchieta is also considered the third saint of Brazil.Jos√© de Anchieta ser√° o terceiro santo do Brasil  Early life  Anchieta was born on 19 March 1534, in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain, to a wealthy family. He was baptized on 7 April 1534 in the Parish of Our Lady of Remedies (now La Laguna Cathedral).La Catedral custodia una reliquia de Anchieta His father, Juan Anchieta y Zelaiaran, was a landowner from Urrestilla, in the Basque Country, who had escaped to Tenerife in 1525 after participating in an unsuccessful rebellion against the Emperor Charles V. Through him, Anchieta was related to Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. His mother was Mencia D√≠az de Clavijo y Llarena, a descendant of the conquerors of Tenerife. Mencia was the daughter of Sebasti√°n de Llarena, a Jew who had converted to Christianity, from the kingdom of Castile. When he was 14 years old, Anchieta went to study in Portugal at the Royal College of Arts in Coimbra. He was intensely religious and felt he had a vocation to the priesthood. He sought admission to the Jesuit College of the University of Coimbra and was accepted into the Jesuits on 1 May 1551, at the age of 17. While he was a novice, he nearly ruined his health by his excessive austerity, causing an injury to the spine that made him almost a hunchback. He learned to write Portuguese and Latin as well as his mother tongue. House of Jos√© de Anchieta in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna (Tenerife).  Missionary in Brazil  Jos√© de Anchieta, by painter Benedito Calixto In 1553, the Jesuits included Anchieta among the third group of their members sent to the Portuguese colony of Brazil, believing that the climate would improve his health. After a perilous journey and a shipwreck, Anchieta and his small group arrived in S√£o Vicente, the first village that had been founded in Brazil in 1534. There he made his first contact with the Tapuia Indians living in the region. In late 1553, Manuel da N√≥brega, the first Provincial of the Jesuits in Brazil, sent 13 Jesuits including Anchieta to climb the Serra do Mar to a plateau along the Tiet√™ River that the Indians called piratininga (from Tupi pira \\"fish\\" + tininga \\"drying\\" ‚Äì according to Anchieta, more than 12,000 fish could be found drying along the Tiet√™ river floodplains after one of its customary floods). There the Jesuits established a small missionary settlement and celebrated Mass for the first time on 25 January 1554, date of the conversion of Saint Paul, according to tradition. That date is now celebrated as the founding of S√£o Paulo. Anchieta and his Jesuit colleagues began their efforts to instruct the native people in the rudiments of Christianity and convert them, while also introducing basic education in other subjects. He taught Latin to the Indians, began to learn their language, Old Tupi, and started compiling a dictionary and a grammar. Their mission settlement, the Jesuit College of S√£o Paulo of Piratininga, soon developed into a small population center. Anchieta and N√≥brega had long opposed the way the Portuguese colonists were treating the Indians and had a serious conflict about it with Duarte da Costa, who served as Governor-General of Brazil from 1553 to 1558. They nevertheless supported the Portuguese against their French rivals in establishing claims to Brazil and welcomed the support of Portuguese authorities against the Huguenot Protestants whom the French at times welcomed to their settlements. In fact, the two Jesuits saw the French colony as a generally Protestant enterprise, ignoring its Catholic components and making no distinction between Lutherans and Calvinists. Anchieta recognized that violence could be necessary to create the conditions for evangelizing the indigenous inhabitants and later praised the colony's third Governor General, Mem de S√° (1500‚Äì1572), for what he accomplished in killing large numbers of Amerindians. Due to the systematic killings and ransacking of their villages by the Portuguese colonists and attempts at enslaving them, the Indian tribes along the coast of the present- day states of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo rebelled and formed an alliance, the Tamoyo Confederation, which soon allied themselves to the French colonists who had settled in Guanabara Bay in 1555 under the command of Vice-Admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. The conflict was brutal and at once international and inter-religious. In one instance the Portuguese hung ten Frenchmen in an attempt to intimidate their enemies into submission. In another in 1557, a Protestant named Jacques le Balleur was put to death and Anchieta, in some interpretations, helped the executioner carry out the sentence, though the facts are much disputed. The Tamoyo Confederation attacked S√£o Paulo several times between 1562 and 1564 without success. Anchieta and N√≥brega initiated peace negotiations with the Tamoyos in the village of Iperoig in modern Ubatuba on the northern coast of S√£o Paulo state. Anchieta's skill with the Tupi language was crucial in these efforts. After many incidents and the near massacre of Anchieta and N√≥brega by the Indians, they finally succeeded in gaining the Indians' confidence, and peace was established between the Tamoyo and Tupiniquim nations and the Portuguese. Portuguese-French hostilities were renewed when Est√°cio de S√°, a nephew of the new Governor-General of Brazil, Mem de S√°, was ordered to expel the French colonists. With the support and blessings of Anchieta and N√≥brega, he departed with an army from S√£o Vicente and founded the ramparts of Rio de Janeiro at the foot of P√£o de A√ß√∫car, in 1565. Anchieta was with him and participated in a number of battles between the Portuguese and the French, each side supported by their Indian allies. He acted as a surgeon and interpreter. He was also responsible for reporting back to the governor-general's headquarters in Salvador, Bahia, and participated in the final victorious battle against the French in 1567. Santos, Brazil After the peace settlement, a Jesuit college was founded in Rio under the direction of N√≥brega. Anchieta was invited to remain and succeeded him upon his death in 1570. Despite his frailty and ill health, and the rigors of slow travel by foot and ship of the time, over the next ten years Anchieta traveled extensively between Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Esp√≠rito Santo and S√£o Paulo, consolidating the Jesuit mission in Brazil. In 1577 the fourth superior general of the Jesuits, Everard Mercurian, appointed Anchieta provincial superior of the order's members in Brazil. As his health worsened, Anchieta requested relief from his duties in 1591. He died in Brazil on 9 June 1597, at Reritiba, Esp√≠rito Santo, mourned by more than 3,000 Indians.  Works  In the tradition of Jesuits, Anchieta was a prolific rapporteur, communicating by letters to his superiors. His reports establish him as an ethnographer, though he focused on Amerindian behavior that did not follow European norms, such as their choice of marriage partners, cannibalism, and the role of sorcerers. His detailed testimony with respect to cannibalism is often cited by anthropologists. He explained, for example, that the Amerindians \\"believe that true kinship comes from the side of the fathers, who are the agents, and ... that the mothers are nothing more than bags in which the children grow\\" and therefore treat the children of a captured female and a member of their tribe with respect but sometimes eat the children of a captured male and a female member of their own tribe. He detailed the practice of polygamy and, because it had produced dense networks of interrelations, advocated easing the Church's consanguinity rules to allow all but brothers and sisters to marry. Anchieta was pioneer in transcribing the Old Tupi language and authored the first published work on that language, a \\"pathbreaking\\" grammar, Arte de gram√°tica da l√≠ngua mais usada na costa do Brasil, written in 1555 and published in 1589. According to one assessment, \\"His grammar and dictionary still rank among the best ever produced of a Brazilian language, nearly 500 years later.... Anchieta was a dedicated linguist whose work can be considered the beginning of Amazonian linguistics (indeed it would not be stretching matters too far to call his work the beginning of linguistics in the Americas.\\" His written works in the indigenous language span theology, religious instruction, theater and poetry. He was also a historian, author of a biography of Mem de S√°. Composed of hexameters, De Gestis Meni de Saa is the first epic about the Americas. It presents de S√° as \\"a Christian Ulysses determined to oust Satan\\" who \\"presides ... over hordes of demonic Amerindians, creatures devoted to dismembering bodies\\". With the arrival of the Jesuits, \\"the Cross expels demons\\" and \\"shamans lose preternatural power as they move from the wilderness into the civilized missions\\". That work of history was one of his two major poems. The other was De Beata Virgine Dei Matre, a poem to the Virgin Mary. Tradition holds that Anchieta composed it while in captivity at Iperoig in 1563 by writing verses in the wet sand of the beach and memorizing each day's lines so that upon his release he could write its 4,900 verses on paper in their entirety. Anchieta in an 1807 engraving. His dramas, written in a combination of Tupi, Portuguese, Spanish, and Latin, were not meant for the stage but for performance by local amateurs in village squares and churchyards. They were traditional in form, written in verse with five-line stanzas, a literary form known as the auto, a Portuguese devotional drama, following the tradition the Jesuits had developed of using the theater first in classrooms and then for popular instruction. Casts were all male, both native and European, and both groups were meant to learn from the dramas' instruction in Christian morals. They were written for special occasions like a saint's feast day or to mark the arrival of relics in the colony. Scholars have noted that they contain considerable \\"contextual information\\", that is references to local events such as village rivalries. For example, Amerindian cannibalism is juxtaposed with the roasting of St. Lawrence. Few of his plays survive, but those that do have been praised, despite being crafted for a local audience with a didactic purpose, for their \\"remarkable feeling for spectacle, calling for the use of body paint, native costumes, song and dance, fights, torches, and processions\\". A performance might even call for cannon fire from a nearby ship, though the plays were typically \\"short on action and long on explanations of doctrine\\" and characters fall clearly into positive and negative types. Anchieta's \\"auto da prega√ß√£o universel\\" of 1567 and published in 1672 is the first dramatic text in Brazilian letters. As a keen naturalist, he described several new plants and animals among the novelties of Brazil's wildlife and geography. His lucid and detailed reports are still important for understanding the beliefs, manners, and customs of the native peoples and European settlers of the sixteenth century. He was also an excellent surgeon and physician. His manuscripts were gathered from archives in Portugal and Brazil in the 1730s as part of the process for his beatification and deposited in Rome. His works have been published as Cartas, Informa√ß√µes, Fragmentos Hist√≥ricos e Serm√µes (Letters, Reports, Historical Fragments and Sermons).

The announcement was first communicated to three priests from the Canary IslandsEl lagunero Padre Anchieta ser√° canonizado en abril (hometown of Anchieta) who attended the Mass of the Pope in his residence in Santa Marta, who communicated it to the Bishop of Tenerife, Bernardo √Ålvarez Afonso.La canonizaci√≥n de Anchieta en primicia He used a process known as equivalent canonization that dispenses with the standard judicial procedures and ceremonies in the case of someone long venerated. Anchieta was the first Spaniard canonized by Pope Francis.Santos espa√±oles canonizados por el Papa Francisco. Conferencia Episcopal Espa√±ola. During and after his life, Jos√© de Anchieta was considered almost a supernatural being. Many legends formed around him, such as that he once preached to and calmed an attacking jaguar. To this day, a popular devotion holds that praying to Anchieta protects against animal attacks. Jos√© de Anchieta is highly revered in the Canary Islands. A bronze statue by Brazilian artist Bruno Giorgi in the city of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna depicts Jos√© de Anchieta departing for Portugal. It was a gift from the Government of Brazil to Anchieta's hometown, where a wooden image of him is also venerated in the Cathedral of La Laguna and carried in procession through the streets every 9 June. In the Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria (patron saint of the Canary Islands), there is a painting of Jos√© de Anchieta founding the city of S√£o Paulo. In 1997, a biographical comic book was published. Patronage Saint Jos√© de Anchieta is the patron and model of catechists. He was also declared by Pope Benedict XVI as one of the thirteen Intercessors of the World Youth Day 2013, held in Rio de Janeiro.Patrones e Intercesores de la Jornada Mundial de la Juventud 2013 In April 2015 he was declared by the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil a copatron of Brazil, whose patron saint is Our Lady of Aparecida. Shrines in his honor The main shrines dedicated to Saint Jos√© de Anchieta in Brazil and the Canary Islands are those that are directly related to his life: * (Canary Islands): In the city of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, his place of birth, the main diocesan shrine is the Cathedral of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, where he was baptized in 1534 and where his image is venerated.La Catedral custodia una reliquia de Anchieta Each June 9 in this city flowers are strewn at the large bronze statue of the saintFiesta de San Jos√© de Anchieta and a solemn Mass is held in the cathedral with the Bishop of Tenerife presiding, followed by a procession with his image through the streets to his birthplace, where flowers are again strewn. * : The National Shrine of San Jos√© de Anchieta is located in the town of Reritiba (now called Anchieta) in the state of Espirito Santo.

Under a Spanish royal commission, he undertook a voyage around the world from 1786 to 1788, then, from 1789 to 1794, a scientific expedition (the Malaspina Expedition) throughout the Pacific Ocean, exploring and mapping much of the west coast of the Americas from Cape Horn to the Gulf of Alaska, crossing to Guam and the Philippines, and stopping in New Zealand, Australia, and Tonga. Malaspina was christened \\"Alessandro.\\" He signed his letters in Spanish \\"Alexandro,\\" which is usually modernized to \\"Alejandro\\" by scholars.; online at Google Books Early life Malaspina was born in Mulazzo, a small principality ruled by his family, then part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire. Alessandro's parents were the Marquis Carlo Morello and Caterina Meli Lupi di Soragna. From 1762 to 1765, his family lived in Palermo with Alessandro's great-uncle, Giovanni Fogliani Sforza d'Aragona, the viceroy of Sicily. From 1765 to 1773 he studied at the Clementine College in Rome. In 1773 he was accepted into the Order of Malta and spent about a year living on the island of Malta where he learned the basics of sailing. Naval service Malaspina entered the Royal Navy of Spain in 1774 and received the rank of Guardiamarina. Between 1774 and 1786 he took part in a number of naval battles and received many promotions. In January 1775, aboard the frigate Santa Teresa, Malaspina took part of the expedition to relieve Melilla, which was under siege by Moroccans. Shortly after he was promoted to frigate-ensign (alf√©rez de fragata). In July 1775 he participated the siege of Algiers and in 1776 was promoted to ship's ensign (alf√©rez de nav√≠o). From 1777 to 1779, aboard the frigate Astrea, Malaspina made a round-trip voyage to the Philippines, rounding the Cape of Good Hope in both directions. During the voyage he was promoted to frigate-lieutenant (teniente de fragata). In January 1780 he was in the Battle of Cape Santa Maria and shortly thereafter was promoted to ship's lieutenant (teniente de nav√≠o). During the Great Siege of Gibraltar, in September 1782, Malaspina served on a \\"floating battery.\\" In December of the same year, aboard the San Justo, Malaspina participated in the fighting at Cape Espartel. He was soon promoted once again, to frigate-captain (capit√°n de fragata). In 1782 he was suspected of heresy and denounced to the Spanish Inquisition, but was not apprehended. From March 1783, to July 1784, Malaspina was second-in-command of the frigate Asunci√≥n during a trip to the Philippines. As with his first trip to the Philippines the route went by the Cape of Good Hope in both directions. In 1785, back in Spain, Malaspina, on board the brigantine Vivo, took part in hydrographic surveys and mapping of parts of the coast of Spain. During the same year he was named Lieutenant of the Company of the Guardiamarinas of C√°diz. Circumnavigation Spanish Landing Site, Bauza Island New Zealand From 15 September 1786 to 18 May 1788 Malaspina made a commercial circumnavigation of the world on behalf of the Royal Philippines Company. During this voyage he was in command of the frigate Astrea.Dario Manfredi, Il Viaggio Attorno al Mondo di Malaspina con la Fregata di S.M.C.¬´Astrea¬ª, 1786‚Äì1788, Memorie della Accademia Lunigianese di Scienze, La Spezia, 1988. His route went via Cape Horn and, returning, the Cape of Good Hope. In February 1787, the Astrea called at Concepci√≥n in Chile, whose military governor, the Irish-born Ambrosio O'Higgins, had six months before recommended that Spain organize an expedition to the Pacific similar to those led by Lap√©rouse and Cook.Archivo Hist√≥rico Nacional (Madrid), Estado, legajo 4289. Also at Archivo Nacional de Chile, Fondo Vicu√±a Mackenna, vol.304, D, ff.5‚Äì26. Published in Revista chilena de historia y geograf√≠a, no.107, 1946, pp.387‚Äì401. O'Higgins had made this recommendation following the visit of the Lap√©rouse expedition to Concepcion in March 1786, and presumably discussed it with Malaspina while the Astrea was at Concepcion. Following the Astrea's return to Spain, Malaspina, in partnership with Jos√© de Bustamante, produced a proposal for an expedition along the lines set out in OHiggins's memorandum. A short time later, on 14 October 1788, Malaspina was informed of the government's acceptance of his plan. Jos√© de Espinoza y Tello, one of the officers of the Malaspina expedition, subsequently confirmed the importance of the information sent by O'Higgins in stimulating the Government to initiate an extensive program of exploration in the Pacific.\\"Noticia de las principales expediciones hechas por nuestras pilotos del Departamiento de San Blas al reconocimiento de la costa noroeste de America, desde el a√±o de 1774 hasta el 1791, extractada de los diarios originales de aquellos navegantes\\", Novo y Colson, Viaje, p.428; cited in Warren L.

At: The prompt acceptance of Malaspina's proposal was stimulated by news that the Russian government was preparing the Mulovsky expedition to the North Pacific, which had as one objective the claiming of territory around Nootka Sound that was also claimed by Spain (see Nootka Crisis and Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest).Pedro Normande to Floridablanca, St. Petersburg, 16 February 1787, Archivo Hist√≥rico Nacional (Madrid), Estado, legajo 4289; copy held at Library of Congress Manuscripts Division, Foreign Copying Project Reproductions; quoted in Anthony H.

Expedition of 1789‚Äì1794 In September 1788, Alessandro Malaspina and Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra approached the Spanish government. The explorers proposed a scientific-political expedition that would visit nearly all the Spanish possessions in America and Asia. The Spanish king, Charles III, a promoter of science in the Spanish Empire, approved. Two corvettes were built under Malaspina's direction specifically for the expedition: Descubierta and Atrevida (meaning \\"Discovery\\" and \\"Daring\\" or \\"Bold\\"). Malaspina commanded Descubierta and Bustamante Atrevida. The names were chosen by Malaspina to honor James Cook's Discovery and Resolution. The two corvettes were constructed by the shipbuilder T√≥mas Mu√±oz at the La Carraca shipyard. They were both 306 tons burden and 36 metres long, with a normal load displacement of 4.2 metres. They were launched together on April 8, 1789. The expedition was under the \\"dual command\\" of Malaspina and Bustamante. Although in time the expedition became known as the Malaspina's, Bustamante was never considered subordinate. Malaspina insisted on their equality, yet Bustamante early acknowledged Malaspina as the \\"chief of the expedition.\\" This map shows the route of Malaspina's ship Descubierta with the return to Spain from Tonga omitted. The route of Bustamante's Atrevida was mostly the same, but deviated in some places. The expedition sailed from C√°diz on July 30, 1789. The bohemian naturalist Thadd√§us Haenke missed the boat, but joined in 1790 in Santiago de Chile after crossing South America by land from Montevideo. The expedition had explicitly scientific goals, as had the recent voyages of James Cook and Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de La P√©rouse. Some of the leading scientists of the day accompanied Malaspina. The scientific data collected during the expedition surpassed that of Cook, but due to changed political circumstances in Spain Malaspina was jailed upon return and the reports and collections locked up and banned from publication. The expedition and its findings remained obscure and nearly unstudied by historians until the late 20th century. Malaspina stopped at Montevideo and Buenos Aires, investigating the political situation of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. After rounding Cape Horn, the expedition stopped at Talcahuano, the port of Concepci√≥n in present-day Chile, and again at Valpara√≠so, the port of Santiago. Continuing north, Bustamante mapped the coast while Malaspina sailed to the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands in order to resolve conflicting data on their location. The two captains reunited at Callao, the port of Lima. There investigations were made into the political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. The expedition then continued north, mapping the coast, to Acapulco, Mexico. A team of officers was sent to Mexico City to investigate the archives and political situation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. By the time Malaspina reached Mexico it was 1791, and there he received a dispatch from the king of Spain, ordering him to search for a Northwest Passage in the region of latitude 60 degrees N, newly thought to have been discovered many years previously. Malaspina had been planning to sail to Hawaii and Kamchatka, as well as the Pacific Northwest.; online at Google Books Instead, he sailed from Acapulco directly to Yakutat Bay, Alaska (then known as Port Mulgrave), where the rumored passage was said to exist. Finding only an inlet, he carefully surveyed the Alaskan coast west to Prince William Sound. At Yakutat Bay, the expedition made contact with the Tlingit. Spanish scholars made a study of the tribe, recording information on social mores, language, economy, warfare methods, and burial practices. Artists with the expedition, Tomas de Suria and Jos√© Cardero, produced portraits of tribal members and scenes of Tlingit daily life. A glacier between Yakutat Bay and Icy Bay was subsequently named after Malaspina. The botanist Luis N√©e also accompanied the expedition, during which he collected and described numerous new plants. Knowing that Cook had previously surveyed the coast west of Prince William Sound and found no passage, Malaspina ceased his search at that point and sailed to the Spanish outpost at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. Malaspina's expedition spent a fortnight at Nootka Sound. While at Nootka, the expedition's scientists made a study of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka peoples). The relationship between the Spanish and the Nootkas was at its lowest point when Malaspina arrived. Malaspina and his crew were able greatly to improve the relationship, which was one of their objectives and reasons for stopping in the first place. Owing in part to Malaspina's ability to bequeath generous gifts from his well- supplied ships about to return to Mexico, the friendship between the Spanish and the Nootkas was strengthened. The gaining of the Nootka chief Maquinna's trust was particularly significant, as he was one of the most powerful chiefs of the region and had been very wary of the Spanish when Malaspina arrived. His friendship strengthened the Spanish claim to Nootka Sound, which was in question after the Nootka Crisis and resolved in the subsequent Nootka Conventions. The Spanish government was eager for the Nootka to agree formally that the land upon which the Spanish outpost stood had been ceded freely and legally. This desire had to do with Spain's negotiations with Britain than over Nootka Sound and the Pacific Northwest. Malaspina was able to acquire exactly what the government wanted. After weeks of negotiations the principal Nootka chief, Maquinna, agreed that the Spanish would always remain owners of the land they then occupied, and that they had acquired it with all due propriety. The outcome of the Nootka Convention depended in part on this pact. In addition to the expedition's work with the Nootkas, astronomical observations were made to fix the location of Nootka Sound and calibrate the expedition's chronometers. Nootka Sound was surveyed and mapped with an accuracy far greater than had previously been available. Unexplored channels were investigated. The maps were also linked to the baseline established by Captain Cook, allowing calibration between Spanish and British charts. Botanical studies were carried out, including an attempt to make a type of beer out of spruce needles that was hoped to have anti-scorbutic properties for combating scurvy. The expedition ships took on water and wood, and provided the Spanish outpost with many useful goods, including medicines, food, various tools and utensils, and a R√©aumur scale thermometer. After departing Nootka Sound the two ships sailed south, stopping at the Spanish settlement and mission at Monterey, California, before returning to Mexico. In 1792, back in Mexico, Malaspina dispatched two schooners (or \\"goletas\\") to conduct more detailed explorations of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia. These were Sut√≠l, commanded by Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano, and Mexicana, under Cayetano Vald√©s y Flores. Both were officers subordinate to Malaspina. The ships were to have been commanded by two pilots of San Blas, Mexico, but Malaspina arranged for his own officers to replace them. In 1792, Malaspina's expedition sailed from Mexico across the Pacific Ocean. They stopped briefly at Guam before arriving at the Philippines, where they spent several months, mostly at Manila. During this period Malaspina sent Bustamante in the Atrevida to Macau, China. After Bustamante's return the expedition left the Philippines and sailed to New Zealand. They explored Doubtful Sound at the southern end of New Zealand's South Island, mapping and carrying out gravity experiments.Robert J. King, \\"Puerto del Pendulo, Doubtful Sound: The Malaspina Expedition‚Äôs Visit to New Zealand in Quest of the True Figure of the Earth\\", The Globe, no.65, 2010, pp.1‚Äì18. Downloadable at: http://search.informit.com.au. Then Malaspina sailed to Port Jackson (Sydney). on the coast of New South Wales Australia, which had been established by the British in 1788.Robert J. King, The Secret History of the Convict Colony: Alexandro Malaspina's report on the British settlement of New South Wales, Sydney, Allen & Unwin Australia, 1990. During the expedition's stay at Sydney Cove, New South Wales, in March‚ÄìApril 1793, Thadd√§us Haenke carried out observations and made collections relating to the natural history of the place, as he reported to the colony's patron, Sir Joseph Banks, saying: \\"I here express the public testimony of a grateful soul for the very extraordinary humanity and kindness with which the English in their new Colony welcomed us wandering vagabonds, Ulysses' companions. A Nation renowned throughout the world, which has left nothing untried, will also overcome with the happiest omens, by the most assiduous labour and by its own determined spirit the great obstacles opposing it in the foundation of what may one day become another Rome.\\"Robert J. King and Victoria Ib√°√±ez, \\"A Letter from Thaddaeus Haenke to Sir Joseph Banks, Sydney Cove, 15 April 1793\\", Archives of Natural History, vol.23, no.2, 1996, pp.255‚Äì259. During its visit to Port Jackson, twelve drawings were done by members of the expedition, which are a valuable record of the settlement in its early years, especially as among them are the only depictions of the convict settlers from this period.Robert Langdon, \\"They Came to Spy on Sydney\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 7 April 1962; Carmen Sotos Serrano, \\"Nuevas obras de Fernando Brambila en Londres\\", Homenaje al Profesor Hern√°ndez Perera, Madrid, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 1992, pp.453‚Äì8. Peter Barber, \\"Malaspina and George III, Brambila, and Watling: Three discovered drawings of Sydney and Parramatta by Fernando Brambila\\", Australian Journal of Art, Vol.XI, 1993, pp.31‚Äì55. The recently founded English colony had been included in the expedition's itinerary in response to a memorandum drawn up in September 1788 by one of Malaspina's fellow naval officers, Francisco Mu√±oz y San Clemente, who warned of the dangers it posed to the Spanish possessions in the Pacific in peacetime from the development of a contraband commerce and in war time as a base for British naval operations. Mu√±oz said: \\"The colonists will be able to fit out lucrative privateers so as to cut all communication between the Philippines and both Americas.... These possessions will have a navy of their own, obtaining from the Southern region whatever is necessary to establish it, and when they have it ready formed they will be able to invade our nearby possessions...\\"Robert J. King, \\"Francisco Mu√±oz y San Clemente and his Reflexions on the English Settlements of New Holland\\", British Library Journal, vol. 25, no.1, 1999, pp.55‚Äì76. In the confidential report he wrote following his visit, Malaspina echoed the warning from Mu√±oz, writing of the \\"terrible\\" future danger for Spain from the English colony at Port Jackson, > from whence with the greatest ease a crossing of two or three months through > healthy climates, and a secure navigation, could bring to our defenceless > coasts two or three thousand castaway bandits to serve interpolated with an > excellent body of regular troops. It would not be surprising that in this > case‚Äîthe women also sharing the risks as well as the sensual pleasures of > the men‚Äîthe history of the invasions of the Huns and Alans in the most > fertile provinces of Europe would be revived in our surprised > colonies....The pen trembles to record the image, however distant, of such > disorders. While recognizing the strategic threat it posed to Spain's Pacific possessions in time of war, Malaspina wrote: \\"It is not the concern of these paragraphs to demonstrate in detail the many schemes for these projected plunderings, so much as the easiest ways of preventing them.\\" He preferred the peaceable approach of drawing attention to the commercial opportunity the new colony offered for a trade in food and livestock from Chile and the development of a viable trade route linking that country with the Philippines. Having seen carts and even ploughs being drawn by convicts for want of draught animals in the colony, and having eaten meals with the colonists at which beef and mutton were regarded as rare luxuries, Malaspina saw the trade in Chilean livestock as the key to a profitable commerce. He proposed that an agreement be signed with London for an Association of Traders, and for an agent of the colony to be resident in Chile. Conscious that the policy he was proposing was a bold and imaginative one in the face of Spain's traditional insistence on a national monopoly of trade and other relations within her empire, Malaspina declared that \\"this affair is exceedingly favourable to the commercial balance of our Colonies,\\" and it would have the advantage of calming and tranquilizing \\"a lively, turbulent and even insolent neighbour....not with sacrifices on our part but rather with many and very considerable profits.\\"Robert J. King, \\"Science and Spycraft: The Malaspina Expedition in New Zealand and New South Wales, 1793\\", Mains‚Äôl Haul, A Journal of Pacific Maritime History, vols.41 no.4 & 42, no.1, Fall/Winter 2006, pp.76‚Äì87. Also at: Returning east across the Pacific Ocean the expedition spent a month at Vava'u, the northern archipelago of Tonga. From there they sailed to Callao, Peru, then Talcahuanco, Chile. The fjords of southern Chile were carefully mapped before the expedition rounded Cape Horn. Then they surveyed the Falkland Islands () and the coast of Patagonia before stopping again at Montevideo. From Montevideo Malaspina took a long route through the central Atlantic Ocean to Spain, reaching C√°diz on September 21, 1794. He had spent 62 months at sea.Lorenzo Sanfeli√∫ Ortiz, 62 Meses A Bordo: La expedici√≥n Malaspina seg√∫n el diario del Teniente de Nav√≠o Don Antonio de Tova Arredondo, 2.o Comandante de la \\"Atrevida\\" 1789‚Äì1794, Madrid, Biblioteca de Camarote ¬´Revista General de Marina¬ª, 1943 y Editorial Naval, 1988. During the five years of this expedition Malaspina fixed the measurements of America's western coast with a precision never before achieved. He measured the height of Mount Saint Elias in Alaska and explored gigantic glaciers, including Malaspina Glacier, later named after him. He demonstrated the feasibility of a possible Panama Canal and outlined plans for its construction.; online at Internet Archive In addition, Malaspina's expedition was the first major long distance sea voyage that experienced virtually no scurvy. Malaspina's medical officer, Pedro Gonz√°lez, was convinced that fresh oranges and lemons were essential for preventing scurvy. Only one outbreak occurred, during a 56-day trip across the open sea. Five sailors came down with symptoms, one seriously. After three days at Guam all five were healthy again. James Cook had made great progress against the disease, but other British captains, such as George Vancouver, found his accomplishment difficult to replicate. It had been known since the mid-18th century that citrus fruit was effective, but for decades it was impractical to store fruit or fruit juice for long periods on ships without losing the necessary ascorbic acid. Spain's large empire and many ports of call made it easier to acquire fresh fruit.  Political controversy and exile  Alessandro Malaspina by Jos√© Mar√≠a Galv√°n In December 1794 Malaspina met with King Charles IV and Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy. At first all was well and Malaspina was promoted to fleet-brigadier in March 1795. In his examination of the political situation in the Spanish colonies Malaspina had decided that Spain should free its colonies and form a confederation of states bound by international trade. In September 1795 he began trying to influence the Spanish government with such proposals. Unfortunately Malaspina had lost the support he used to have at the royal court before his voyage and the political situation had changed radically, due in part to the French Revolution. He was tricked by Prime Minister Godoy into appearing to form part of a conspiracy to overthrow him, and arrested on November 23 on charges of plotting against the state. After an inconclusive trial on April 20, 1796, Charles IV decreed that Malaspina be stripped of rank and imprisoned in the isolated fortress of San Ant√≥n in La Coru√±a, Galicia. Malaspina remained in the prison from 1796 to 1802. During his incarceration he wrote a variety of essays on topics such as aesthetics, economics, and literary criticism. Francesco Melzi d'Eril and later, through him, Napoleon campaigned for Malaspina's release. He was finally freed at the end of 1802 but was exiled from Spain. He left for his hometown of Mulazzo via the port of Genoa, and settled in nearby Pontremoli. Because of Spain's conflict with revolutionary France, there were no funds in the naval budget for publishing his seven- volume account of the 1789‚Äì94 expeditions: it remained unpublished until the late 19th century (apart from a Russian translation by Adam von Krusenstern in successive issues of the official journal of the Russian Admiralty between 1824 and 1827).Pedro de Novo y Colson, Viaje politico cientifico alrededor del mundo por las corbetas Descubierta y Atrevida, al mando de los capitanes de navio, don Alejandro Malaspina y don Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra, desde 1789 a 1794, Madrid, 1885; M¬™ Dolores Higueras Rodriguez, Diario General del Viaje Corbeta Atrevida por Jos√© Bustamante y Guerra, Museo Naval y Ministerio de Defensa, La Expedici√≥n Malaspina, 1789-1794, Tomo IX, Barcelona, Lunwerg Editores, 1999, p.48; ¬´–ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤—ñ–µ –≤—ä –Æ–∂–Ω–æ –º–æ—Ä–µ, –∫—ä –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–∏–º—ä –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞–º—ä –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∏ –∏ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞–º—ä –ú–∞—Ä—ñ–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º—ä –∏ –§–Ω–ª–∏–ø–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º—ä, —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø–æ–¥—ä –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–æ—é –ö–∞—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ- –ò—Å–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –§–ª–æ—Ç–∞ –ö–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤—ä –ú–∞–ª–µ—Å–ø–∏–Ω–∏ –∏ –ë—É—Å—Ç–∞–º–∞–Ω—Ç–µ¬ª, (‚ÄòVoyage to the South Sea, West coast of America and the Mariana and Philippine islands, under the overall command of Spanish Royal Navy Captains Malaspina and Bustamante‚Äô), –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏, –∏–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞–µ–º—ã—è –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º—ä –ê–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª—Ç–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–º—ä –î–µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º—ä, –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—è—âi—è—Å—è –∫—ä –ú–æ—Ä–µ–ø–ª–∞–≤–∞–Ω—ñ—é, –ù–∞—É–∫–∞–º—ä –∏ –°–ª–æ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (Zapiski, izdavayemiya Gosudarstvennim Admiralteiskim Departmentom, otnosyashchiyasya k' Moryeplavaniyu, Naukam i Slovesnosti / Notices issued by the State Admiralty Department relating to Navigation, Science and Literature), VI, 1824, pp.188-276; VII, 1824, pp.121-223; VIII, 1825, pp.176-272; IX, 1825, pp.1-292; XII, 1827, pp.29-191, 29-191; XIII, 1827, pp.10-178. A large portion of the documents meant to be used as source material for the publication of Malaspina's expedition remained scattered in archives to the present day. A significant number of documents are lost, and those that survive are often in a rough, semi-edited form. Alexander von Humboldt, an admirer of Malaspina, wrote, \\"this able navigator is more famous for his misfortunes than for his discoveries.\\" There was some contemporary publication, but it took two hundred years for the bulk of the records of the expedition to be published. The notes made by the expedition's botanist, Luis Ne√©, while he was at Port Jackson in 1793, were published in 1800.Antonio Joseph Cavanilles, \\"Observaciones sobre el suelo, naturales y plantas de Puerto Jackson y Bahia Botanica\\", Anales de Historia Natural, No.3, 1800; translated into German by Christian Augustus Fischer, \\"Die Spanier in Neu Sud Wallis\\", Spanische Miszellen, Berlin, 1803 and Dresden, 1804, pp.3 25, and by Fischer into French, \\"Visite des Espagnols √† la Nouvelle Galles Meridionale: Fragment d'un Voyage in√©dit de Malaspina\\", Annales des Voyages, de la G√©ographie et de l'Histoire, Paris, Tome IX X, 1809, pp.340 355. Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano's journal of his survey of the straits between Vancouver Island and the mainland, carried out as part of the Malaspina expedition, was published in 1802 with all mention of Malaspina's name excised.Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano, Relaci√≥n del Viage, hecho por las Goletas Sutil y Mexicana, en el a√±o 1792 para reconocer el Estrecho de Juan de Fuca, Madrid, 1802. In 1809, Jos√© Espinosa y Tello published the astronomical and geodesic observations made during the expedition in a two-volume work that also contained an abbreviated narrative of the voyage.Josef Espinosa y Tello, Memorias sobre las Obervaciones Astronomicas, hechas por los Navegantes Espa√±oles en Distintos Lugares del Globo, Madrid, Imprenta Real, Tomos I & II, 1809. This narrative was translated into Russian and published by Admiral Adam von Krusenstern in St. Petersburg in 1815.¬´–ò–∑–≤—£—Å—Ç—ñ–µ –æ –ò—Å–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –≠–∫—Å–ø–µ–¥–∏—Ü—ñ–∏ –ü—Ä–µ–¥–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–æ–π –ª–¥—è –û—Ç–∫—ã—Ç—ñ–∏ –≤—ä 1791, 1792 –∏ 1793 –≥–æ–¥–∞—Ö—ä –ø–æ–¥—ä –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–æ—é –ö–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –ú–∞–ª–µ—Å–ø–∏–Ω–µ¬ª, –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏, –∏–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞–µ–º—ã—è –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º—ä –ê–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª—Ç–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–º—ä –î–µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º—ä, –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—è—âi—è—Å—è –∫—ä –ú–æ—Ä–µ–ø–ª–∞–≤–∞–Ω—ñ—é, –ù–∞—É–∫–∞–º—ä –∏ –°–ª–æ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (‚ÄòNews on the Spanish Discovery Expedition of 1791, 1792 and 1793 commanded by Captain Malespina‚Äô, Notices issued by the State Admiralty Department relating to Navigation, Science and Literature), II, 1815, pp.256‚Äì260. During his own voyage to the North Pacific of 1803 to 1806, Krusenstern surveyed the west coast of Japan in May 1805 and on his resulting chart made the generous gesture of naming a prominent cape on the coast of Hokkaido \\"after the unfortunate Spanish navigator Malespina [sic]\\" (A.J. von Krusenstern, Voyage round the World, translated by Richard Belgrave Hoppner, London, John Murray, 1813, Vol.II, p.38).

The journal of Malaspina's voyage was first published in Russian translation by Krusenstern in successive issues of the official journal of the Russian Admiralty between 1824 and 1827 (a copy of the manuscript had been obtained by the Russian ambassador in Madrid in 1806).¬´–ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤—ñ–µ –≤—ä –Æ–∂–Ω–æ –º–æ—Ä–µ, –∫—ä –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–∏–º—ä –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞–º—ä –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∏ –∏ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞–º—ä –ú–∞—Ä—ñ–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º—ä –∏ –§–Ω–ª–∏–ø–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º—ä, —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø–æ–¥—ä –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–æ—é –ö–∞—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ-–ò—Å–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –§–ª–æ—Ç–∞ –ö–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤—ä –ú–∞–ª–µ—Å–ø–∏–Ω–∏ –∏ –ë—É—Å—Ç–∞–º–∞–Ω—Ç–µ¬ª, (‚ÄòVoyage to the South Sea, West coast of America and the Mariana and Philippine islands, under the overall command of Spanish Royal Navy Captains Malaspina and Bustamante‚Äô), –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏, –∏–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞–µ–º—ã—è –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º—ä –ê–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª—Ç–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–º—ä –î–µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º—ä, –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—è—âi—è—Å—è –∫—ä –ú–æ—Ä–µ–ø–ª–∞–≤–∞–Ω—ñ—é, –ù–∞—É–∫–∞–º—ä –∏ –°–ª–æ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (Zapiski, izdavayemiya Gosudarstvennim Admiralteiskim Departmentom, otnosyashchiyasya k' Moryeplavaniyu, Naukam i Slovesnosti / Notices issued by the State Admiralty Department relating to Navigation, Science and Literature), VI, 1824, pp.188‚Äì276; VII, 1824, pp.121‚Äì223; VIII, 1825, pp.176‚Äì272; IX, 1825, pp.1‚Äì292; XII, 1827, pp.29‚Äì191 –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏, XII; XIII, 1827, pp.10‚Äì178 –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏, XIII.

Later life In Pontremoli, which by then was part of the short-lived Kingdom of Etruria, Malaspina concerned himself with local politics. In December 1803 he organized a quarantine between the Napoleonic Italian Republic and the Kingdom of Etruria during a yellow fever epidemic in Livorno. In 1805 he received the title of Advising Auditor of the Council of State of the Kingdom of Italy. The Queen of Etruria received him at court in December 1806. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to the Columban Society in Florence with the title of Addomesticato. The first appearance of an incurable illness occurred in 1807. Alessandro Malaspina died in Pontremoli on April 9, 1810, at the age of 55. His death was noted in the Gazzetta di Genova, 18 April 1810: > Pontremoli, 9 April 1810: Today at 10 o'clock in the evening the learned and > famous navigator Signore Alexandro Malaspina of Mulazzo passed from this > life. Such a loss cannot fail to be felt far and wide by all those who, > placing high value on the importance of the nautical and travel accounts of > this most talented Italian, have known his equanimity in both good and bad > fortune; it is without doubt most bitter for those who witnessed the end > from close by and who, moreover, had to admire his fortitude in suffering > patiently to the very last the most severe pains of a long intestinal > illness.See also Gazzetta Universale, No.33, 24 Aprile 1810, pag.2. Legacy Malaspina University-College and Malaspina International High School in the Canadian city of Nanaimo, British Columbia took their names indirectly from the explorer (although these names have been recently changed to Vancouver Island University and the High School at VIU), by way of Malaspina Strait, between Texada Island and the mainland, and the Malaspina Peninsula and adjoining Malaspina Inlet nearby, which are the location of Malaspina Provincial Park and are part of the Sunshine Coast region. Vancouver Island University is home to the Alexandro Malaspina Research Centre. There is also a Malaspina Peak and Malaspina Lake near Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island, just southeast of the town of Gold River; and the well-known Malaspina Glacier in southern Alaska.

She ultimately became central to one of the most famous English criminal mysteries of the 18th century. She disappeared on 1 January 1753, before returning almost a month later to her mother's home in Aldermanbury in the City of London, emaciated and in a \\"deplorable condition\\". After being questioned by concerned friends and neighbours she was interviewed by the local alderman, who then issued an arrest warrant for Susannah Wells, the woman who occupied the house in which Canning was supposed to have been held. At Wells' house in Enfield Wash, Canning identified Mary Squires as another of her captors, prompting the arrest and detention of both Wells and Squires. London magistrate Henry Fielding became involved in the case, taking Canning's side. Further arrests were made and several witness statements were taken, and Wells and Squires were ultimately tried and found guilty‚ÄîSquires of the more serious and potentially capital charge of theft. However, Crisp Gascoyne, trial judge and Lord Mayor of London, was unhappy with the verdict and began his own investigation. He spoke with witnesses whose testimony implied that Squires and her family could not have abducted Canning, and he interviewed several of the prosecution's witnesses, some of whom recanted their earlier testimony. He ordered Canning's arrest, following which she was tried and found guilty of perjury. Squires was pardoned, and Canning sentenced to one month's imprisonment and seven years of transportation. Canning's case pitted two groups of believers against one another: the pro-Canning \\"Canningites\\", and the pro-Squires \\"Egyptians\\". Gascoyne was openly abused and attacked in the street, while interested authors waged a fierce war of words over the fate of the young, often implacable maid. She died in Wethersfield, Connecticut in 1773, but the mystery surrounding her disappearance remains unsolved. History =Background= Canning was born on 17 September 1734 in the City of London, the eldest of five surviving children born to William (a carpenter) and Elizabeth Canning. The family lived in two rooms in Aldermanbury Postern (a northern extension of Aldermanbury that formerly ran from a postern gate on London Wall to Fore Street; it no longer exists) in London. Aldermanbury was a respectable but not particularly wealthy neighbourhood. Canning was born into poverty. Her father died in 1751 and her mother and four siblings shared a two-room property with James Lord, an apprentice. Lord occupied the building's front room, while Canning's family lived in the back room. Her schooling was limited to only a few months at a writing school, and aged 15 or 16 she worked as a maidservant in the household of nearby publican John Wintlebury, who considered her an honest but shy girl. From October 1752 she lived at the neighbouring home of a carpenter Edward Lyon, who shared Wintlebury's opinion of the young maidservant. Canning was described as a plump 18-year-old, about tall with a face pitted by smallpox, a long, straight nose, and wide-set eyes. =Disappearance= Canning disappeared on 1 January 1753. With no work that day, she spent time with her family and made plans to go shopping with her mother after visiting her aunt and uncle (Alice and Thomas Colley), but changed her mind and instead remained with them for the evening. At about 9 pm, accompanied by her aunt and uncle for about two-thirds of the journey, she left to return to her lodgings in Aldermanbury. When she failed to return to her lodgings at Edward Lyon's house, her employer twice went looking for her at her mother's home. Mrs Canning sent her other three children to Moorfields to search for her, while James Lord went to the Colleys, who told him that they had left Elizabeth at about 9:30 pm near Aldgate church in Houndsditch. The next morning Mrs Canning also travelled to the Colleys' house, but to no avail, as Elizabeth was still missing. Neighbours were asked if they knew of her whereabouts, and weeks passed as Mrs Canning searched the neighbourhood for her daughter, while her relatives scoured the city. An advertisement was placed in the newspapers, prayers were read aloud in churches and meeting houses, but other than a report of a \\"woman's shriek\\" from a hackney coach on 1 January, no clues were found as to Elizabeth's disappearance. =Reappearance= Canning reappeared at about 10 pm on 29 January 1753. At the sight of her daughter, whom she had not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. Once recovered she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. Elizabeth was described as being in a \\"deplorable condition\\"; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a shift, a petticoat, and a bedgown. A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. She awoke \\"by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me\\" and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would \\"go their way\\" (become a prostitute). Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft. There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. She recalled hearing the name \\"Wills or Wells\\", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road. On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of \\"Mother\\" Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, nearly distant. Her reappearance and subsequent explanation (including the assumption that she had been held at Wells's house) were the following day printed in the London Daily Advertiser. She was visited by the apothecary, but with her pulse faint, and so weak she could scarcely speak, she vomited up the medicine he gave her. He administered several clysters until satisfied with the results, following which Canning was taken by her friends and neighbours to the Guildhall to see Alderman Thomas Chitty, to ask that he issue a warrant for Wells's arrest. Enfield Wash \\"A Plan of the house of Susanna Wells at Enfield Wash\\" from The London Magazine, 1754 Chitty issued the warrant and on 1 February Canning's friends took her to Enfield Wash. Despite her poor physical condition Canning's supporters wanted her to identify her captors and the room she claimed to have been held in, and worried she might die before then, took the risk of moving her. Wintlebury, Scarrat and Joseph Adamson (a neighbour) were the first to arrive, on horseback. They met the warrant officer and several peace officers, and waited for Susannah Wells to appear. Wells's house had served a variety of functions, including that of a carpenter's shop, a butchers and an ale-house. The old woman kept animals in the house and occasionally had lodgers. She had twice been widowed; her first husband was a carpenter and her second had been hanged for theft. She had also been imprisoned in 1736 for perjury. Sarah Howit, her daughter by her first husband, had lived there for about two years. Howit's brother John was a carpenter like his father, and lived nearby. When at about 9 am Wells entered her house, the officers immediately moved to secure the building. Inside they found Wells, an old woman named Mary Squires, her children, Virtue Hall and a woman they supposed was Wells's daughter. Another woman, Judith Natus, was brought down from the loft to be questioned with the rest. The warrant officer who searched the loft was surprised when he discovered that it did not resemble the room described by Canning, and nor could he find evidence of her having jumped from the window. The rest of the party, who had by then arrived in a hired coach and chaise, were similarly surprised. Canning, who had arrived in the chaise with her mother and two other people, was carried into the house by Adamson. There she identified Mary Squires as the woman who had cut off her stays, and claimed that Virtue Hall and a woman presumed to be Squires's daughter had been present at the time. Canning was then taken upstairs where she identified the loft as the room in which she had been imprisoned‚Äîalthough it contained more hay than she recalled. Boards covering the window appeared to have only recently been fastened there. With such damning evidence against them, the suspects were taken to a nearby justice of the peace, Merry Tyshemaker, who examined Canning alone, and then those from Wells's house. Squires and Wells were committed, the former for removing Canning's stays and the latter for \\"keeping a disorderly House\\". George Squires and Virtue Hall, who both denied any involvement in the kidnapping, were set free; Canning and her supporters were allowed home. Fielding's investigation Henry Fielding investigated Canning's claims Assault in 18th-century England was viewed by the authorities not as a breach of the peace, but rather as a civil action between two parties in dispute. The onus therefore was on Canning to take legal action against those she claimed had imprisoned her, and she would also be responsible for investigating the crime. This was an expensive proposition and she would therefore require the help of her friends and neighbours to pursue her case. An additional complication was that rather than send such matters to trial, justices preferred to reconcile the parties concerned. Therefore, although it was the state in which she returned to them on 29 January which most offended Canning's friends, it was the theft of her stays‚Äîvalued then at about 10 shillings‚Äîthat was the most promising aspect of the case. The theft could be tried under a capital statute, making the assault charge less worthy of legal attention. While Canning's medical treatment continued, her supporters, mostly men, prepared the case against Squires and Wells. They took legal advice from a solicitor, a Mr Salt, who advised them to consult the Magistrate and author Henry Fielding. Fielding was 45 years old, and after years of arguments with other Grub Street authors and a lifetime of drink, was approaching the end of his life. Since \\"taking the sacrament\\" four years earlier and becoming a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and Westminster, he had, with \\"volcanic energy\\", concerned himself with the activities of criminals. In December 1751 he had published Amelia, a story of a young woman dragged into vice and folly by her abusive husband. Although the book was poorly received, with his experience of criminology Fielding believed he understood the depths to which humans could descend. Thus when Salt divulged the case to him on 6 February Fielding's curiosity was piqued, and he agreed to take Canning's sworn testimony the next day. Although Fielding was disinclined to believe a simple servant-girl he was impressed with her modesty and genteel manner, and issued a warrant against all the occupants of Wells's house, \\"that they might appear before me, [and] give Security for their good Behaviour\\". Virtue Hall and Judith Natus were thus seized, but George Squires, his sisters, and Wells's daughter Sarah Howit, had by then left the house and remained at large. Early press reports The London Daily Advertiser, a Grub Street publication, reported on 10 February: Meanwhile Canning's supporters were soliciting donations through the Case of Elizabeth Canning, an independently printed pamphlet designed to raise support for the prosecution of her captors. In the Case of, Wells was clearly identified as \\"that Monster of a Woman\\", and in an edited version which appeared a week later in the Public Advertiser it was revealed that Canning had suffered a fit after being struck on the head. Squires was called an \\"old Gypsy Woman\\", who \\"robbed the girl of her stays; and then in a miserable naked Condition, because she would not become a common Prostitute, confined her in an old Back Room or loft\\". Although Squires was often referred to as a gypsy this identification had, on occasion, been called into question. Being named a gypsy could carry certain legal penalties and although these were rarely applied, gypsies were nevertheless treated as pariahs. Moore (1994) described Squires as a \\"dark, tall, but stooping, elderly woman, with an estimated age ranging from sixty to eighty, sometimes depicted as exceptionally hearty\\", continuing \\"all accounts do agree that she was an exceptionally ugly woman, with a very large nose and a lower lip swollen and disfigured by scrofula.\\" Therefore, for a while, the public were firmly on Canning's side. An 18-year-old servant girl threatened with prostitution and held captive by a remarkably ugly old gypsy of bad repute, having escaped, emaciated, to return to her loving mother; it was a story that the vast bulk of general public as well as the gentry, found irresistible. Virtue Hall's confession Fielding prided himself upon his fairness‚Äîno matter what the social standing of the witness‚Äîhe subjected Hall to repeated questioning and, frustrated at her contradictory answers, threatened her with imprisonment. This had the desired effect because on 14 February Hall stated that John Squires (son of Mary) and another man had brought Canning to Wells's house early on the morning of 2 January. There, before the two kidnappers, Lucy Squires and Hall, the old woman had assaulted Canning and forced her upstairs, where she remained until her escape. Hall said that Fortune Natus and his wife Judith had been at the house for some weeks but were moved into the loft to make it appear as though they had stayed there throughout January. Hall's and Canning's evidence now tallied almost perfectly, and Fielding turned to Judith Natus. Although she corroborated Hall's claim that she and her husband had slept in Wells's loft throughout January, Fielding was unconvinced and urged her to reconsider her statement. Although not charged with any crime, Hall meanwhile was committed to the Gatehouse Prison in Westminster, her stay paid for by the Canningites. Fielding left London for a short while before returning to interview Squires, Wells and the others. Wells and Squires denied any knowledge of Canning or her travails, and strongly protested their innocence. This had little credence, due to the long-standing habit of the accused of breaking the law and lying about it. The story as it had appeared in the London Daily Advertiser had already aroused the public's interest. Fielding had left London believing that he had \\"ended all the trouble which I thought it necessary for me to give myself in this affair\\", but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence, amongst others, several \\"Noble Lords\\" had attempted to contact him. On 15 February a reward was offered for the capture and conviction of John Squires and his unnamed associate. Also listed were the locations at which donations could be left, \\"either applied to the carrying on of the Prosecution, or given to the poor Girl as a Recompence for her Virtue, and Miseries she has gone through\\". A rather embellished account of the story was later sent to the press. George Squires could not be found. =Trial of Squires and Wells= Squires, charged with assault and theft, and Wells, with \\"well-knowing\\" what her accomplice had done, were tried on 21 February at the Session House of the Old Bailey. The Lord Mayor of London Sir Crisp Gascoyne presided over the court with a panel of other justices, including Martin Wright (Justice of the King's Bench), Nathaniel Gundry (Justice of the Common Pleas), Richard Adams (Baron of the Exchequer since 1753; formerly Recorder of London), and William Moreton (appointed Recorder of London in 1753).A Complete Collection of State Trials and Proceedings for High Treason and Other Crimes and Misdemeanors from the Earliest Period to the Year 1783: With Notes and Other Illustrations, Volume 19 (27 George II), Thomas Jones Howell, David Jardine, case 530, col 261‚Äì276, and case 532, col 283‚Äì680, 1418 The gallery was packed with interested spectators. The charge of theft was extremely serious; the value of Canning's stays (about 10 shillings) meant that if she was found guilty, Squires would almost certainly be hanged at the Tyburn Tree. As she arrived at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd gathered outside the building. Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men \\"to the prisoner Wells's house\\" at about 4 am on the morning of 2 January. In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her \\"if I chose to go their way\\". Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. She told the court she \\"saw nothing brought up[, but w]hen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf\\". She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window at the north end of the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: \\"Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [Monday] morning.\\" Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted \\"I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks\\". A 19th-century portrait of Mary Squires, as printed in The Newgate Calendar Next to appear on the stand was Virtue Hall, who recounted much of her earlier statement to Fielding. Squires again interrupted, asking \\"What day was it that the young woman was robbed?\\" The answer came back, from the court: \\"She says on the morning of the 2nd of January\\", and Squires replied \\"I return thanks for telling me, for I am as innocent as the child unborn\\". Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall \\"They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in\\". Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say \\"Wills or Wells\\", as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions. Although both were subpoenaed as witnesses neither Fortune nor Judith Natus were called to the stand, the attorney responsible later explaining that the mob outside may have intimidated several witnesses. Susannah Wells's neighbours were turned away by the mob and her daughter and half-brother were quickly recognised and stopped. However, three witnesses found in Dorset by George Squires, to testify for his mother, passed by unrecognised. The first, John Gibbons, said that the Squires had visited his house in Abbotsbury \\"with handkerchiefs, lawns, muslins, and checks, to sell about town\\" from 1‚Äì9 January. This was corroborated by his neighbour, William Clarke. Squires's last witness, Thomas Greville, claimed that he had accommodated Mary and \\"her sister and her brother\\" under his roof in Coombe, on 14 January, where they sold \\"handkerchiefs, lawns, and such things\\". This was contradicted by John Iniser, a fishmonger around Waltham Cross and Theobalds. Insier claimed he knew Squires by sight and that in the three weeks before her arrest he had seen her telling fortunes in the neighbourhood of Wells's house. Wells, whose witnesses had been unable to pass by the mob outside, was able to offer only two sentences in her defence. She told the court that she had not seen Canning before 1 February, and that \\"as to Squires, I never saw her above a week and a day before we were taken up.\\" According to a contemporary report in the London Daily Advertiser, as the three witnesses left the court the mob, waiting in the yard, \\"beat them, kicked them rolled them in the Kennel and otherwise misused them before they suffered them to get from them\\". Verdict Character witnesses in 18th-century English trials were, according to author Douglas Hay, \\"extremely important, and very frequently used ... in character testimony too, the word of a man of property had the greatest weight. Judges respected the evidence of employers, farmers and neighboring gentlemen, not mere neighbors and friends.\\" The jury were apparently unimpressed by the defence's case and pronounced both defendants guilty. They were sentenced on 26 February; Wells would be branded in her hand and spend six months in prison. For stealing Canning's stays, Squires was to be hanged. By March 1753 pamphlets on Canning's story were being read in the coffee-houses of London. There was widespread outrage over Squires' treatment of her, exacerbated when Little Jemmy, \\"a poor man who cries sticks about the streets\\" was supposedly robbed and then stamped on by five gypsies. Canning was celebrated by the mob and gentry, several of whom contributed to her purse, enabling her to move to better accommodation in the house of a Mr Marshall, a cheesemonger in Aldermanbury. Gascoyne's investigation Sir Crisp Gascoyne was convinced that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Not everybody was satisfied with the verdict. The trial judge Sir Crisp Gascoyne and some of his colleagues on the bench found Canning's story extremely unlikely. Gascoyne had been disgusted by Canning's supporters, who while outside the court had prevented witnesses from giving evidence, and he was particularly sympathetic to Mary Squires, whom he named \\"the poor creature\\". Then 52 years old, Gascoyne had started life as a Houndsditch brewer before he married the daughter of a wealthy physician. He had progressed through the ranks to become Master of the Brewer's Company, then served as Alderman of Vintry Ward, Sheriff of London, and been knighted after presenting an address to the king. He had argued on behalf of the city's orphans and was known for his benevolence in Essex, where he owned large estates. Gascoyne at once began a private enquiry and wrote to the Anglican minister at Abbotsville, James Harris. He thought it unlikely that the three witnesses found by George Squires would travel so far \\"to foreswear themselves on behalf of this miserable object\\" and Harris did not disappoint. The Reverend was able to corroborate Gibbons's testimony and offer new witnesses who could claim to have seen Squires well away from Enfield Wash. Gascoyne also thought that some of the Canningites doubted the girl's veracity and had colluded in her version of events to spite him; this, he thought, was a political attack on a public official and he refused to let the matter rest. He justified his activities by comparing his apparent compassion for the victim, Mary Squires, with his outrage for the deceit of her accuser, Elizabeth Canning, but his fervour was influenced in part by the attitudes of the time. He considered the behaviour of the Canningites inappropriate for their low station and was more impressed by the assurances of people such as Alderman Chitty and Reverend Harris, who as gentlemen and public advocates were presumed more reliable. Gascoyne's colleague on the bench, Mr Justice Gundry, had written to the Undersheriff of Dorset, who knew John Gibbons and William Clarke. The Undersheriff wrote back claiming that they \\"would not have given evidence had it not been true\\". Clarke may have been in a relationship with Lucy Squires, and claimed that he had stayed with the Squires in Ridgeway. Fifteen prominent residents of Abbotsbury, including churchwardens, Overseers of the Poor, a schoolmaster and a tithing man swore that the Squires were in Dorset in January and that their witnesses were trustworthy men. A further six Abbotsbury men walked to sign an affidavit corroborating their neighbours' evidence. Fielding and Gascoyne had each issued contradictory pamphlets on the case, but it was Virtue Hall's testimony, fundamental in the prosecution of Squires and Wells, which became central to Gascoyne's investigation. Hall had given her testimony to Fielding under threat of imprisonment and when by chance the Grub Street writer John Hill heard from a Magistrate that she had showed signs of remorse, he was presented with a perfect opportunity to settle an old score. A prodigious writer and author of a renowned newspaper column, The Inspector, Hill had squabbled with several of his peers, notably so in Fielding's case, as Fielding had closed that argument in his Covent Garden Journal by stating that \\"this hill was only a paltry dunghill, and had long before been levelled with the dirt.\\" Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then staying at the Gatehouse Prison, although still not charged with any crime. Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that \\"particular persons only\\" were allowed to visit. Hall was again questioned on 7 March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. When asked why she had lied to the court, she said \\"when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but was told it was not the truth. I was terrified and threatened to be sent to Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth.\\" She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of the things about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability. =Perjury= Reverend Harris had several of his witnesses sent to London, where they were interviewed by Gascoyne. In Newgate Prison on 9 March, Gascoyne also interviewed Susannah Wells, who confirmed Hall's new version of events. He then performed several interviews from 12‚Äì13 March, including Fortune and Judith Natus, and a witness who could cast doubt on John Iniser's testimony. Gascoyne also asked George and Lucy Squires about their travels early in 1753; George was unable to recall all the places they had visited, and so Gascoyne sent him to Dorset to help him remember. Gascoyne then met with Elizabeth Long (Wells's daughter), who had been prevented by the mob from testifying for her mother, and on 23 March three of Canning's former witnesses expressed to Gascoyne their doubts about the young maid's story. Another witness, who swore that Squires had been in Abbotsbury in January, was interviewed two days later. Gascoyne instructed him to visit Squires in Newgate, where the two recognised one another immediately. Meanwhile, John Myles, who had replaced Salt and who now led the Canningites, had been gathering witnesses who could claim they had seen Mary Squires in the vicinity of Enfield Wash. One said he had seen two men dragging a woman towards Enfield early in January. Others told him they had on 29 January seen \\"a miserable poor wretch\\" travelling toward London Myles found witnesses who claimed they had seen Squires at Enfield Wash in December and January. Myles unwittingly made Gascoyne aware of his investigation when he asked a John Cooper of Salisbury his opinion of seven of Gascoyne's witnesses, who claimed they had seen Squires in Coombe. Cooper wrote back affirming the good character of Thomas Greville (who had testified for Squires at her trial), but later sent the same information to Gascoyne, offering his support. At this point it appeared certain to Gascoyne that Canning had not told the truth. Through January, he thought, the Squires had very likely been travelling through Dorset, Hampshire, and then London, and had not been in Enfield Wash to kidnap Canning. On 13 March, he therefore ordered Canning arrested, for perjury. Public spats Gascoyne's investigation caused a press frenzy. The output of the writers and publishers of Grub Street emboldened opinions about the case, and in some instances reinforced long-held stereotypes of \\"wicked Gypsies and a poor innocent girl refusing to yield her honour\\". The Canningites stirred up anti-gypsy sentiment with a range of pamphlets and advertisements, one of which named the now deeply unpopular Gascoyne \\"the King of the Gipsies\\". Reports began to emerge, of sinister goings-on; one such claimed that several men on horseback threatened that \\"they would burn all the people's houses, barns and corn thereabouts\\", should Squires be hanged. George II issued a stay of execution on Squires's sentence, and later a pardon. Canning's honesty (or lack of it) and Fielding's handling of the case were raised in a deeply critical attack printed by The London Daily Advertiser. On the same day that Gascoyne ordered Canning's arrest an advertisement appeared in the Public Advertiser, asking its readers \\"to suspend their judgement in the Case of the Gypsy Woman till a full State of the whole, which is now being prepared by Mr. Fielding, is published.\\" Fielding had learnt of Hall's questioning by Gascoyne and had brought Canning to his house in Bow Street, to \\"sift the truth out of her, and to bring her to confession if she was guilty.\\" Satisfied with her account, and unconcerned with Hall, his critique of Squires' supporters was published as A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning, in which he espoused the virtuous nature of the young maid and attacked those her detractors. Copies sold so quickly that a second print run was ordered two days later. John Hill saw A Clear Statement as a direct attack on Gascoyne, and blasted Fielding with The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered, which ridiculed his enemy with such comments as: \\"Who Sir, are you, that are thus dictating unto the Government? Retire into yourself and know your station.\\" Fielding, however, played little part in the saga from thereon, believing that Canning's supporters had begun to see him as an obstacle to their case. About half of those condemned to death during the 18th century went not to the gallows, but to prison, or colonies abroad. Although pardons were not common, it was possible to bypass the Judge and petition the king directly, and although Gascoyne had some concerns about the character of the witnesses upon whom he was able to call, he nevertheless wrote to George II to request that Squires be pardoned. On 10 April 1753 therefore the king granted a stay of execution of six weeks, while new evidence on both sides of the case was sent to the Lord Chancellor Lord Hardwicke and the Attorney and Solicitor-General. Squires would receive her pardon on 30 May 1753, but Wells was less fortunate; she served her sentence and was released from Newgate on 21 August. Trial of the Abbotsbury men While Squires's eventual pardon was being deliberated upon, Myles was busy building Canning's defence. He was far from complacent; on 20 April he was in Dorchester with a warrant for the arrest of Gibbons, Clark and Greville, the three Abbotsbury men who had testified for Squires. With a small armed party he captured Gibbons and Clarke at the local inn and took them back to Dorchester, but his warrant was incorrectly worded and Gibbons was released by the justice. Clarke was taken to London and interrogated by Myles at his house, for two days, but the cordwainer refused to cooperate. He was granted bail and returned to Abbotsbury. The three were charged with \\"wilful corrupt perjury\\" and tried on 6 September 1753 at the Old Bailey. As Lord Mayor, and fearing accusations of bias, Gascoyne excused himself from the case. The defendants were represented by William Davy, who had earlier defended Squires and Wells. Over 100 people were present to testify on their behalf, but the Canningites stayed away; they were unaware of Gascoyne's withdrawal and feared an embarrassing release of evidence to the public from an appearance by Canning. They also kept their witnesses away; with the exception of one of Mrs Canning's neighbours, none were present. Myles had not been paid by his employers, and to delay proceedings, his brother Thomas sent a clerk to deliver to the court a selection of writs, but nevertheless Gibbons, Clark, and Greville were found not guilty, and released. At this point Canning had not been seen publicly for some time, and she was proclaimed an outlaw. When in November 1753 a new Lord Mayor was installed she remained out of sight, but at the February Sessions in 1754 she reappeared at the Old Bailey and presented herself to the authorities. Canning's trial Canning's trial began at the Old Bailey on Monday 29 April 1754, continuing on Wednesday 1 May, 3‚Äì4 May, 6‚Äì7 May and ending on 8 May‚Äîan unusually long trial for the time. During jury selection the defence objected to three potential jurors (much less than the Crown's 17 objections) but were too late to argue the choice of foreman, who, it was claimed, had publicly called Canning \\"a LYING B‚Äî‚ÄîH, a CHEAT, or an IMPOSTER\\". Presiding over the courtroom was the new Lord Mayor, Thomas Rawlinson (Crisp Gascoyne's successor Edward Ironside having died in office in November 1753), with Edward Clive (Justice of the Common Pleas), Heneage Legge (Baron of the Exchequer), William Moreton (Recorder of London), and Samuel Fludyer, alderman. Canning was represented by three attorneys, George Nares, John Morton and a Mr Williams. Prosecuting was Gascoyne's son Bamber, Edward Willes and William Davy. After her indictment was read by the Clerk of Arraigns the story of Canning's supposed abduction and imprisonment was retold by Bamber Gascoyne. Then Davy spoke at length. He attacked Canning's story and told how Squires and her family had travelled through England with smuggled goods to sell. He offered new evidence to support Squires' alibi and rubbished Canning's description of her prison, before questioning her account of her escape. He concluded with Virtue Hall's recantation of her earlier testimony. Willes was the next to speak, picking over the discrepancies between the various accounts offered by Canning of her disappearance. A contemporary sketch of the loft in which it was supposed Canning was held Canning's defence began with opening statements from Williams and Morton. The latter emphasised her misfortune at twice being subjected to such anguish, firstly for prosecuting her assailants and secondly for being punished for doing so. He complimented the jury and poured scorn on Davy's allegations, and seized upon the prosecution's unwillingness to call Virtue Hall to the stand. Morton highlighted how unlikely it was that Canning could so profoundly fool her supporters and countered the prosecution's complaint about Canning's description of the loft. The third attorney, George Nares, concentrated on the societal problems of prosecuting Canning for perjury, implying that other victims of crime would be less likely to pursue their assailants, for fear of being prosecuted themselves. Morton questioned George Squires, who could not recall with absolute certainty the path he claimed his family took through the south of England while Canning was missing. His sister Lucy was not called to the stand, as she was considered \\"rather more stupid than her brother, and has not been on the road since their coming to Enfield Wash\\". Robert Willis, who had accompanied Squires to retrace the gypsy family's steps, was also called to testify; his evidence was judged as hearsay and ruled inadmissible. As in the trial of Squires and Wells, the reliability of the prosecutor's witnesses was considered dependent upon their character. Three men from Litton Cheney testified that they had seen the Squires family enter the village on 30 December. The three Abbotsbury men then stepped up and gave their evidence. 39 witnesses for the prosecution were heard on the first day alone; most of them establishing briefly the Squires family's alibi. At the end of the first day's proceedings the mob outside, expecting a short trial and a not guilty verdict, were presented not with the young maid but rather with Crisp Gascoyne. Infuriated, they threw dirt and stones at him, forcing him to retreat to a nearby inn, before returning to the court to escort Canning away from the building. On 1 May therefore the trial continued not with a resumption of the first day's examination, but with concern over the attack on Gascoyne. A guard was found to protect him and the jury, a member of Canning's defence was forced to apologise, and the Canningites later that day printed a notice appealing to the crowd to not interfere. Alderman Thomas Chitty was sworn in and, guided by Bamber Gascoyne, gave his account of his first meeting with Canning on 31 January 1753. Davy questioned several witnesses, who described the discrepancies in Canning's account of her prison. One of them told of his disgust at Virtue Hall's testimony against Squires. Along with several other witnesses including Sarah Howit, Fortune and Judith Natus testified that Canning had never been in the loft before 1 February and that it was in fact Howit and Virtue Hall who had been in the loft in January. The end of the day's proceedings was again overshadowed by the mob outside, and Gascoyne was accorded an escort of \\"a Body of Constables\\". Friday saw yet more witnesses for the prosecution, bringing the total brought by Davy to about 60. The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells's house. Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish whether or not she could have been sustained for a month by the bread she claimed to have been given. On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too stupid to have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing \\"a little\\". This, in Davy's view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile. Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells's house before Canning had disappeared. Two of Canning's neighbours testified to her \\"deplorable condition\\". Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a \\"poor, miserable wretch\\" at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped. The Trial of Elizabeth Canning On 6 May more witnesses for the prosecution were called. As Squires and her family watched, several of Wells's neighbours insisted they had, about the beginning of 1753, seen the old gypsy in the area. More witnesses claimed to have seen her in various places around Enfield Wash, including one woman who swore she had seen her on Old Christmas Day. Britain's calendar had in September 1752 changed from the old-style Julian calendar, to the Gregorian calendar, and the woman was unable to discern the exact day on which she claimed to have seen Squires. She was not alone; several of the defence's witnesses were also unable to manage the 11-day correction required by the calendar change. Others were illiterate, and struggled similarly. The court also heard from three witnesses present solely to discredit the testimony offered by the Natuses. The final day's proceedings were taken up by Davy, who produced more prosecution witnesses, and proceeded to pick apart the testimony of those who claimed to have seen Squires in Enfield Wash, in January. He summarised the prosecution's case by telling the jury that Canning was guilty of \\"the most impious and detestable [crime] the human heart can conceive\\". The recorder, William Moreton, stated the defence's case, and asked the jury to consider if they thought that Canning had answered the charges against her to their satisfaction, and if it was possible she could have survived for almost a month on \\"no more than a quartern-loaf, and a pitcher of water\\". =Verdict, repercussions, later life= The jury took almost two hours to find Canning \\"Guilty of perjury, but not wilful and corrupt.\\" The recorder refused to accept the verdict as it was partial, and the jury then took a further 20 minutes to find her \\"Guilty of Wilful and Corrupt Perjury.\\" Crisp Gascoyne was not present when the verdict was delivered; he had been advised to leave earlier, to avoid any trouble outside the court. The defence tried unsuccessfully for a retrial. Canning, held at Newgate prison, was sentenced on 30 May. By a majority of nine to eight, she was given a month's imprisonment, to be followed by seven years' transportation. According to the State Trials, Canning spoke, and \\"hoped they would be favourable to her; that she had no intent of swearing the gypsey's life away; and that what had been done, was only defending herself; and desired to be considered unfortunate\\". The Conjurers (1753). Canning, Fielding, Gascoyne, Hill, and Squires, share the stage with The Bottle Conjuror. The verdict did nothing to assuage the ferocity of the debate. Transcripts of the trial were extremely popular, and portraits of the implacable young maid were offered for sale from shop windows. A reward was offered for information on anyone who had attacked Gascoyne, but mainly the Grub Street press concerned itself with the fallout from the affair. The Gazeteer was filled with satirical letters between such authors as Aristarchus, Tacitus, and T. Trueman, Esq. One such, a Canningite called Nikodemus, complained that without gypsies, \\"what would become of your young nobility and gentry, if there were no bawds to procure young girls of pleasure for them?\\" Those on Squires's side were not the only ones to come under such attacks; John Hill wrote a short song celebrating his and Gascoyne's role in the affair, and pictures of Canning in the loft, her bodice loosened to reveal her bosom, were readily available. Another showed Wells and Squires held aloft by a broomstick, an obvious allusion to witchcraft. Gascoyne had stood for Parliament during Canning's trial, but came bottom of the poll. To justify his pursuit of Canning, he wrote An Address to the Liverymen of the City of London, from Sir Crisp Gascoyne, and suffered not only literary but physical attacks, as well as death threats. The Canningites published several responses to Gascoyne's thoughts, including A liveryman's reply to Sir Crisp Gascoyne's address, and A refutation of Sir Crisp Gascoyne's of his conduct in the cases of Elizabeth Canning and Mary Squires, the latter presenting the trial as the culmination of a Gascoyne vendetta against Canning. Canning, held at Newgate, was reported to be in the presence of Methodists, an unfortunate accusation for her side. On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of St Mary Magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the Church of England. Among her visitors was Mr Justice Ledinard, who had helped deliver Virtue Hall to Gascoyne. Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that \\"I have said the whole truth in court, and nothing but the truth; and I don't choose to answer any questions, unless it be in court again.\\" Despite calls for clemency, she was taken to the convict ship Tryal for her voyage to British America. Several threats made by the ship's crew, however, meant she eventually sailed on board the Myrtilla in August 1754. Canning arrived in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend Elisha Williams. She was not employed as a servant, but was taken in as a member of Williams' family. Williams died in 1755, and Canning married John Treat (a distant relation of the former governor Robert Treat) on 24 November 1756, had a son (Joseph Canning Treat) in June 1758, and a daughter (Elizabeth) in November 1761. She had two more sons (John and Salmon), but died suddenly in June 1773. Views and theories For Georgian Britain, the story of Elizabeth Canning was fascinating. Little attention was paid in the trial to Squires's request for Canning to \\"go their way\\"; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning's chastity, while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of (in view of the immense interest taken in the case, this last seems unlikely). The author Kristina Straub compares the case with the more general debate over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a \\"childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws\\", or \\"a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds\\". The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal \\"her own criminal Transactions in the Dark\\". Straub opines that the debate was not merely about Canning's guilt or innocence, but rather \\"the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order.\\" The partisan nature of the Canningites and the Egyptians ensured that the trial of Elizabeth Canning became one of the most notorious criminal mysteries in 18th-century English law. For years the case was a regular feature in such publications as The Newgate Calendar and the Malefactor's Registers. Artist Allan Ramsay wrote A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of ‚Äî Concerning the Affair of Elizabeth Canning, which was the inspiration for Voltaire's Histoire d'Elisabeth Canning, et de Jean Calas (1762), who shared Ramsay's opinion that Canning had gone missing to hide a pregnancy. The case was revisited in 1820 by James Caulfield, who retold the story but with several glaring mistakes. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries several authors offered their own interpretations of the case. Caulfield's essay was followed in 1852 by John Paget's Elizabeth Canning. Paget's apt summary of the case read: \\"in truth, perhaps, the most complete and most inexplicable Judicial Puzzle on record\\". Canning's trial was marked by the prosecution's inability to find any evidence whatsoever that she had been anywhere but in Wells's home, and where Canning was in January 1753 remains unknown. Similarly, mystery surrounds the precise movements of the Squires family, when it was supposed they were travelling through Dorset early in 1753. The writer F. J. Harvey Darton suspected that the family were smugglers, and that it was significant they had passed through Eggardon, where Isaac Gulliver operated (although Gulliver was, at the time, a child). The 18th-century artist Allan Ramsay claimed that Canning's initial story was \\"exceedingly stupid\\", and false. He viewed the lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind. The US author Lillian Bueno McCue theorised that she was an amnesiac, and that her former employer, John Wintlebury, was to blame for her imprisonment at the Wells house. Treherne (1989) considers this theory very unlikely however, and instead concludes that Canning was almost certainly at Enfield Wash, but was not kept prisoner at Wells's home. He suggests that Robert Scaratt implanted the suggestion that Canning had been held at the Wells's house, as a useful decoy, and that he had somehow been involved in an unwanted pregnancy. Treherne also suggests that Canning was suffering from partial amnesia, and that she may not have lied intentionally at the trial of Squires and Wells. He calls Canning \\"the first media product.\\" Although some early authors adopted the same stance as Fielding or Hill, who actively took sides in the affair, most later writers believe that Canning did not tell the truth. Moore (1994), however, believes that Canning was probably innocent. Moore explains discrepancies between Canning and the Squires' testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications, and placing much emphasis on the ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits‚Äîoften at the expense of others.

The story has become part of Gujarati folk culture. The twins were from a northern town known as Vadnagar near Visnagar in the state of Gujarat. Tana and Riri both girls are closely related to Narsih Maheta. Narasih Maheta's grand daughter is Sharmishtha who is mother of Tana and Riri. Narendra Modi presents Tana-Riri and Pandit Omkarnath Sangeet Awards The legend When Akbar's court singer, maestro Tansen's preceptor died, he sang the raag \\"Deepak\\". The effect of singing this raag is said to be that the singer starts feeling an incurable heat in his/her body. When Tansen was affected by the burns of the Deepak raag, he roamed around the whole of India. Finally the commander in chief of their army, Amjadkhan, came to Vadnagar and found out about the two sisters Tana and Riri who were proficient singers and could cure Tansen (expert of raag dipak) by singing raga Malhar. When they were asked to sing at Akbar's court, they refused to come since it was their vow as Nagars only to sing in front of the village deity's idol. Instead they committed suicide by drowning in a well. They chose to do this rather than to refuse, which would have caused a war-like situation in their town. Later when Akbar came to know of it he apologised to their father and asked Tansen to develop a new genre of pieces named in honor of Tana-Riri. The villagers who feared attack by Akbar's army, got converted to Banias now known as Dashanagar. Legacy A memorial has been erected in Vadnagar to honour Tana-Riri.

Biography Rodocanachi was born in Liverpool, England, to a Greek family. He studied in Marseille, received his medical degree in Paris in 1903, and opened a pediatric practice in Marseille. In 1907 he married Fanny Vlasto in London and they settled in Marseille. Their only child Constantine was born in 1908. At the outbreak of World War I, Rodocanachi was working in a children's hospital in Marseille. In 1915 he gained French citizenship and joined the Chasseurs Alpins. He served in Alsace and at the Somme, was once gassed and twice wounded, and received the Croix de Guerre and the Legion d'Honneur. After the war he returned to his practice. During World War II, after Vichy France had accepted an armistice with Nazi Germany, Rodocanachi made contact with the British Seaman's Mission in Marseille and treated British soldiers who had missed the evacuation at Dunkirk. After the mission was closed by the Milice, he met Elisabeth Haden-Guest and begun to work with her to hide escapees and Jewish refugees. When Ian Garrow founded what became known as the Pat O'Leary Line, Rodocanachi's home in Marseille became one of the main safe houses of the network. Garrow also stayed there until the French police arrested him in 1941. With the help of his wife and couple of associates, Rodocanachi helped numerous people, many of them downed Allied airmen. He hid them in his house and arranged false identity papers until they could be helped to escape either across the Pyrenees or to a Royal Navy submarine. Rodocanachi also helped refugee Jews gain admittance to the United States. The U.S. consulate named him examining doctor for Jewish immigrants. He used his position to provide medical certificates to justify their entry into the USA. Rodocanachi was also nominated to the medical board of the Michel-L√©vy Hospital. The board made medical examinations to determine whether prisoners of war were unfit for military service and hence could be repatriated. Rodonacachi did his best to have as many men as possible declared unfit. The board ceased to function when the Germans occupied rest of France. The secret work took its toll and his angina pectoris got worse over the years. Eventually the Pat Line was betrayed. On 25 February 1943 Rodocanachi was arrested at his home by six Gestapo. His wife later suspected that the house concierges had notified the Germans. Rodocanachi persisted in treating the other inmates in prison. On 17 December 1943 Rodocanachi was moved to a prison in Compi√®gne, and on 17 January 1944 he was transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp. He died there in the spring of 1944.

Held annually, and with therefore the most public exposure, it is by far the most famous of such Da Jiu festivals, with Jiu () being a Taoist sacrificial ceremony. Such events are held by mostly rural communities in Hong Kong, either annually or at a set interval of years ranging all the way up to once every 60 years (i.e. the same year in the Chinese astrological calendar). Other places that may share the folk custom include Taiwan, Sichuan, Fujian and Guangdong.  Overview  The old-style \\"Bun Mountain\\" made up of bamboo poles Dancers in the Flying Colors Parade. Cheung Chau's Bun Festival, which draws tens of thousands of local and overseas tourists every year, is staged to mark the Eighth day of the Fourth Month, in the Chinese calendar (this is usually in early May). It coincides with the local celebration of Buddha's Birthday. The Cheung Chau Bun Festival began as a fun and exciting ritual for fishing communities to pray for safety from pirates. Today this religious origin has largely been forgotten, and the festival has mainly a become a showcase of traditional Chinese culture. Kwok Kam Kee, the official bun supplier for the festival which was opened 40 years ago, makes over 60,000 buns for the festival.  History  Cheung Chau Bun Festival in 1961. One story of the origin of the festival is that in the 18th century, the island of Cheung Chau was devastated by a plague and infiltrated by pirates until local fishermen brought an image of the god Pak Tai to the island. Paraded through the village lanes, the deity drove away evil spirits. Villagers also disguised themselves as different deities and walked around the island to drive away the evil spirits. Activities =Vegetarian= McVeggie Every year on the 8th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, the islanders organise a weeklong thanksgiving, the Cheung Chau Bun Festival usually in April or May. The festival lasts for seven days. On three of these days the entire island goes vegetarian; most of the island's famous seafood restaurants adhere to this tradition. The local McDonald's also takes meat off the menu and instead sells veggie burgers made of mushrooms. =Parade of floats= In addition to traditional lion dances and dragon dances, children dressed as legendary and modern heroes are suspended above the crowd on the tips of swords and paper fans (). They form the parade-in-the-air and are all secured within steel frames, though they appear to glide through the air. Parents consider it a great honour for their offspring to be part of the parade. This fascinating procession is accompanied by the bedlam of musicians loudly beating gongs and drums to scare away evil spirits. It is led by a spectacular image of Pak Tai, the God of Water and Spirit of the North, to whom the island's Temple of the Jade Vacuity is dedicated. =Deities= Here are some divinities Cheung Chau people celebrate in the festival: Pak Tai Since Cheung Chau is traditionally an island of fisherfolk, Pak Tai is its most revered divinity, since it is believed he has the power to confer smooth sailing for the fishing boats as well as providing good catches for their crews. Pious believers recognise him as \\"Pei Fang Chen Wu Hsuan T'ien Shang Ti\\" (True Soldier and Superior Divinity of the Deep Heaven of the North). Tin Hau (Lin Mo Niang)  The second of the significant deities involved in the pageant is the much-revered Tin Hau, Goddess of the Seas and protector of all fishermen and boat people. Celebrated for providing warnings of imminent storms and saving countless lives from wreckage, she is in many ways Pak Tai's competitor for the fondness of the fisherfolk. Kuan Yin and Hung Hsing Two more gods complete the celestial divinities taking part in the parade: Kuan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy with her tranquil and ever compassionate smile; and Hung Hsing, the terrifying God of the South with his menacing head-dress, unkind face, bushy black beard, and stave at the ready to chastise all enemies = Bun snatching = Bun snatching in 1961. The centrepiece of the festival is at Pak Tai Temple where the \\"Bun Mountains\\" or \\"Bun Towers\\"(ÂåÖÂ±±) stand. These are three giant 60-feet bamboo towers covered with buns. It is these bun-covered towers that give the festival its name. It originates from the custom in Southern Fujian and Chaozhou known as qianggu (), where people snatch food that has been offered to the lonely spirits. Historically, young men would race up the tower to get hold of the buns; the higher the bun, the better fortune it was supposed to bring to the holder's family; the race was known as \\"Bun-snatching\\" ().TVB show 1st quarter of 2008: , exclusive on the bun race. However, during a race in 1978 one of the towers collapsed, injuring more than 100 people. In subsequent years, three designated climbers (one climber to each tower) raced up their respective towers and having cleared the top buns proceeded to strip the towers of their buns as they descended. The three \\"Bun Mountains\\" are still placed in the area in front of Pak Tai Temple, and are constructed using the traditional fixation method ‚Äî bamboo scaffolding. In 2005, a single tower climbing event in the adjacent sports ground was revived as a race‚Äîwith extra safety precautions including proper mountain-climbing tools as well as tutorials for participants (which now include women). A teamwork version of the event was added in 2006. The revised version of \\"Bun-snatching\\" as well as the traditional three \\"Bun Mountains\\" still have their buns removed from the towers at midnight of the Festival. In February 2007, it was further announced that the buns on the single-tower construct will henceforth be made of plastic.HK government: Bun Festival upholding both tradition and safety During the festival, Chinese operas, lion dances, and religious services also take place on the island.

Return of bun-snatching The new \\"Bun Mountain\\" used for bun-snatching competitions As mentioned above, the bun-snatching ritual was abandoned by government decree due to the 1978 collapse of a tower. Still, many Cheung Chau villagers regard this celebration as part and parcel of their life, and also as an example of the precious culture of Hong Kong. In addition to the villagers' immense urge to resume the ritual, a local cartoon movie My life as McDull recalled the abandoned ceremony, giving rise to nostalgia in its viewers. Because of its great popularity, the long-awaited ritual was reintroduced on 15 May 2005. Safety measures were intensified: only 12 well- trained athletes selected from preliminary competitions were permitted to climb on one single \\"Bun Mountain\\", and instead of bamboo, the framework of the \\"Bun Mountains\\" was made of steel. =More about My life as McDull and bun-snatching= My life as McDull was a sizable hit in Christmas 2001. This Hong Kong animated feature was primarily targeted at children. Aside from the cute character designs, however, My Life as McDull had also shown many renowned qualities of Hong Kong people‚Äîhard-working, carefree, and never giving up. The \\"Hong Kong dream\\" depicted in the film charmed much of its audience. The animation is aided by computer-generated backgrounds, but it retains a delightful hand-drawn look that is pleasing to movie-goers. In a part of the film, McDull decides to train to be an Olympic-level athlete like the Hong Kong Olympian Lee Lai-shan. However, the trade he learns is Cheung Chau bun-snatching. Realising that bun-snatching is not a formal sporting event in the Olympic games, McDull's mother writes a letter to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), asking him/her with her limited proficiency of English to sanctify the so-called sport event.

Biography Legros was born in Isma√Ølia in the Kingdom of Egypt. He first wished to be a ballet dancer. After World War II he moved from Cairo to Paris. He married an American woman, possibly as a way of gaining US citizenship; Legros was homosexual. Legros met Elmyr de Hory, according to Irving, at a party given by de Hory in 1955 in New York City. Legros was introduced to de Hory by a mutual acquaintance, Dr. Josue Corcos.Irving, Clifford. \\"Fake! The Story of Elmyr de Hory, the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time\\", pg 96. Legros and de Hory's partnership began in earnest in Florida. Elmyr de Hory intended to live and work in Florida, as he had in previous years, and de Hory was persuaded to allow Legros to accompany him when de Hory left New York. In de Hory's words: \\"And then a week or so later we left New York together, in the Cadillac, for Florida. That was the beginning of everything.\\"Irving, Clifford. \\"Fake!

Over the next thirteen years, Elmyr de Hory produced artworks which were then sold by Legros and Lessard all over the world. While Legros and Lessard became wealthy, they kept de Hory on a small allowance to induce him to continue working. Eventually Legros built a house for de Hory on the island of Ibiza. \\"It was then, for the first time, that Elmyr began to suspect that his partners were becoming rich.\\"Irving, Clifford. \\"Fake!

He was very skilled at mimicking the handwriting of historical American figures. Early life Joseph Cosey was born Martin Coneely on February 18, 1887, in Syracuse, New York. He was the son of Irish Catholic immigrant Robert Coneely, a \\"cabinetmaker by trade\\", and Sarah Bease of Virginia. He did very well in elementary and high school, but left home at the age of 17 after quarreling with his father. Cosey worked as a printer's apprentice (he had helped his older brother Robert in his printing shop), wandering from place to place and job to job. In each place, he would use the local library to satisfy his interest in 19th century American history. He joined the United States Army in 1909, and \\"was sent to the Philippines as a private with Company G, 19th Infantry.\\" He was dishonorably discharged four years later for assaulting the company cook. He forged a certificate of honorable discharge. Forger Cosey was caught and sentenced several times for various crimes, including motorcycle theft, forging checks and using fake delivery receipts to steal $30,000 in negotiable bonds. Cosey used various false names. He served around ten years in various prisons, including San Quentin, and was released in the late 1920s. Cosey's career of historical forgery began by chance. In 1929, he went to the Library of Congress and asked to see some old documents; he stole a pay warrant endorsed by Benjamin Franklin in 1786. When he tried to sell it to a New York City book dealer, however, the dealer told him it was a fake. Stung, Cosey practiced forging signatures for several months and then sold the same dealer a scrap of paper with the writing \\"Yrs. Truly, A. Lincoln\\" for $10. Cosey forged signatures, entire letters and manuscripts of such historical figures as George Washington, James Monroe, Button Gwinnett, and Mark Twain. Several fake Lincoln letters were produced, as well as Thomas Jefferson's supposed draft of the Declaration of Independence. As time went on, he occasionally composed his own documents rather than simply copy authentic ones. He used old paper, brown ink and writing implements that the contemporary writer would have used - this made his documents so convincing that they fooled several experts. Cosey rarely victimized amateur collectors, often stating \\"I take pleasure in fooling the professionals\\". He was so prolific and good that, in 1934, the New York Public Library set up the Cosey Collection to both alert the public and remove his work from circulation. Even with the considerations Cosey made to give his forgeries the look of authentic documents, he eventually made mistakes. One such involved his use of the style that the historical figure would have used in their prime, when the date of the document would have called for the writer's hands to tremble with old age. Later forgeries were also easier to spot; Cosey began to use modern chemicals to age modern paper. Cosey was arrested in 1937 after selling a fake letter (supposedly from Abraham Lincoln) to a stamp dealer. The dealer analyzed the letter and discovered the forgery. Cosey confessed his crimes and was eventually sentenced to three years in prison. He was released in less than a year, and continued to make forgeries into the 1940s. Impact Several forgeries produced by Joseph Cosey are most likely still in circulation. Over the years, they have become valuable collectors' items in their own right. Examples of his work, as known forgeries, are held in various collections, among them the Alfred Whital Stern Collection of Lincolniana in the Library of Congress. The noted collector A. S. W. Rosenbach was proud to have a Cosey forgery of two verses from Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\".

The short, which shows an old man who competes with himself in a game of chess, was Pixar's first film to feature a human being as its main character; Geri later made an appearance in Toy Story 2. Geri's Game was released eight years after Knick Knack, the last short by Pixar, made as part of an effort to reignite the studio's short film series, which had been put on standby in order to focus on the creation of the studio's first feature film, which would become the first-ever full-length computer-animated film, Toy Story. A dedicated research and development team worked alongside the filmmakers to devise ways to get around the burdens of animating a human character, leading to an in-house computer simulation to mimic the natural movement of clothing on a character. Subdivision surface modeling, a technique partly pioneered by Edwin Catmull in 1978 but mostly ignored in favor of NURBS surfaces, was used to bestow natural movement and realistic skin textures on the human character himself. Geri's Game premiered on November 24, 1997, winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the following year. It was later shown with the theatrical release of Pixar's second feature film, A Bug's Life, the following year, and therefore became part of a Pixar tradition of pairing shorts with feature films. Plot In an empty park during fall, the title character, Geri (voiced by Bob Peterson), is an elderly man who plays a game of chess against himself, \\"becoming\\" each of the players in turn by moving to the other side of the chessboard, where he changes his personality and either puts on or takes off his glasses to show this change. As the game progresses, it seems as though there are two people playing; at one point, the hands of both \\"opponents\\" are seen within the frame. Geri's aggressive alter ego soon gains the upper hand over Geri, capturing every one of his pieces except for the king and the queen. Just one false move on the king, and the queen is captured and he can't move his king, putting him in check. However, Geri outsmarts himself by faking a heart attack to distract himself and spinning the board around, knocking over the pieces. While his alternate self is still distracted, Geri checkmates what is now his opponent's king. Finding that he is now the one who is losing and realizing what has happened, Geri begrudgingly resigns the game and hands over a set of dentures as the prize. Geri then puts them into his mouth, chuckling and basking in his victory as he sits by himself, while the camera pulls back to reveal him alone at the chessboard. Development Geri's Game was Pixar's first original short film since 1989, when Knick Knack was released. It was directed and written by Jan Pinkava, who joined the studio in 1993 to work on their TV commercials while the other directors and writers were preoccupied with the production of Toy Story, and had been continuously approaching executive producer Darla K. Anderson with the proposal that the studio make a new short film. = Initial conception = Work on the short began shortly after the release of Toy Story and during early production of A Bug's Life, when Ed Catmull decided that the studio should resurrect its short films production as a way to not only bring new animators and storytellers into Pixar, but also as a way to further push research and development for the studio. For the first of these shorts, which would be the first one made in 8 years, Catmull wanted Pixar to create a story which featured a human as its central protagonist. Upon Anderson's suggestion, he reached out to Pinkava to direct the short. According to Pinkava himself, Catmull said he could direct the short as long as it starred a human character and had a serviceable story behind it. When trying to brainstorm a concept, Pinkava asked himself if he would be able to come up with a story that featured only one character, which would both give it an artistic edge and make development easier on the technical side of things, as coming up with just a single stylized, but credible, human character was hard enough. He designed an elderly character belonging to the polar opposite age sector of Billyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7x4qUKWCf0, the infant character in Tin Toy, and one of Pixar's earliest attempts at creating a human character. He felt it would be interesting to animate a character with the body language of an old man, similar to how Billy was animated with the gesticulations of a baby. = Story evolution = After spending time storyboarding and brainstorming ideas, Pinkava came up with 3 different concepts starring an elderly male character; one of these concepts was about him playfully riding up and down an elevator, while another one involved him playing a game of chess against himself. The latter idea was inspired by Pinkava and his elderly relatives' love of chess‚Äîparticularly his grandfather, an avid chess player who would often play rounds of the game with only himself. Pinkava pitched an early animatic version of the chess story, and was turned down and given a second chance to restart and further develop the story. After giving a second pitch with a more structured plot, the project was green-lit and Karen Dufilho was issued to produce the project. Pinkava, who grew up in Czechoslovakia, was inspired by the works of Czech filmmaker and storywriter Ji≈ô√≠ Trnka, particularly his stop motion puppet films; Trnka's characters, usually human ones, were marionette puppets that had vastly stylized body and facial features, which Pinkava similarly applied somewhat to Geri's character design, with facial attributes such as his nose and chin. Pinkava did several maquettes of different designs for Geri before settling on his final appearance, which he then sculpted into a (3D) clay model that was baked by Jerome Ranft and digitally scanned into Pixar's animation software. (Ranft initially was the clay sculptor for the character, working on his head and hands, but after receiving continuous suggestions on how to tweak the model, he reportedly handed the sculpting utensil to Pinkava, simply telling him, \\"You do it,\\" while smiling.) = Technology = Geri's voice (vocal intonations) came from Pixar writer Bob Peterson. Peterson wanted Pixar to be able to create a short that could technologically push the studio to new heights; specifically, he wanted Pixar to create a short film featuring a character that could display both convincing-looking skin and realistic cloth animation. The first Pixar short film with a human main character, Geri's Game was produced with the goal of \\"[taking] human and cloth animation to new heights\\".Geri's Game - Behind the Scenes at PixarRobertson, Barbara. \\"Meet Geri: The New Face of Animation\\" , Computer Graphics World, 1998. To achieve the goal of producing a believable 3D human character, two people were brought on to do research for the project: Michael Kass, who did the calculations behind the physics for a dynamic cloth system, and Tony DeRose, who made use of subdivision surfaces, a technique invented by Catmull in conjunction with Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark, which allowed for more lifelike skin surfaces. Previously, most 3D character surfaces were crafted using several non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) that had to be \\"stitched\\" together, which made for less expressive movement and caused models to frequently tear. The use of subdivision surfacing, which renders a character's skin as one large surface, allowed for smoother object movement, as well as more intricate detail. DeRose had been working on the technology at the University of Washington, and had already brought subdivision surfaces to CAD makers, who were ultimately unconvinced, and held their faith in NURBS, before bringing it to Pixar, which was much more receptive. On the clothing side, after toiling endlessly, Kass managed to create a system which could emulate/simulate the movement of cloth, at which point the team realized that the suit jacket they had modeled didn't fit with Geri's movement outside of a default T-pose. According to Pinkava, Steve Jobs, upon a hearing about the issue, had offered to help him by enlisting tailor Giorgio Armani to help them design an outfit for Geri, which he ultimately declined. The development of a dynamic cloth simulator made several changes to the way that animators work; for instance, the animation, when completed, needed to be sent to the simulator, which would automatically insert Geri's jacket and calculate its movements, rather than being directly sourced to the renderer after being finished. Geri also needed to be animated 30 frames in advance in order to get the simulation going, and animators couldn't \\"cheat\\" by having off-camera body parts go unanimated, as it would affect how the simulating program moved the clothing. Like other Pixar shorts, Geri's Game contains no spoken dialogue, and so is driven only by the actions and expressions of its main character. To further push the ability to convey the film's story, extra detail was put into Geri's facial rigging compared to previous rigging methods, with rigger Paul Aichele giving the character hundreds of face controls for animators to use. These new, more detailed rigging methods went on to be used in A Bug's Life, which was being worked on at the same time. = Staff = Like previous short films made by Pixar, Geri's Game was made by a temporary branch of Pixar employees, and was separate from the people working on the studio's feature films. It took roughly a year to produce, according to Pinkava, largely due to the amount of time allotted to developing the cloth simulation. While the short was being made, most of Pixar Studios was preoccupied with making A Bug's Life. Despite this, there were 18 different animators that worked on the project (including Pixar storywriter Pete Docter, who contributed a few scenes out of sheer interest). Despite being preoccupied directing A Bug's Life, John Lasseter suggested adding a scene in which Geri checks to make sure he's alright after seeing his alter ego stage a heart attack and keel over; Lasseter physically staged out the entire scene to Pinkava. Release Geri's Game premiered on November 24, 1997 at Laemmle's Monica Theater in Santa Monica, California. It was also attached to the theatrical release of Pixar's second feature film, A Bug's Life, in 1998, and subsequently featured on that film's VHS and DVD releases.

Early life and education Sturges was born in 1947 in New York. From 1966 to 1970, he served in the United States Navy as a Russian linguist. He graduated with a BFA in Perceptual psychology and Photography from Marlboro College and received an MFA in photography from the San Francisco Art Institute.  Career  His subjects are nude adolescents and their families, primarily taken at communes in Northern California and at the Atlantic-coast naturist resort CHM Montalivet in Vendays-Montalivet. Much of his work features California resident Misty Dawn, whom he shot from when she was a child until in her twenties. Sturges primarily works with a large 8x10-inch-format view camera. He has taken some digital photographs but prefers to work with prints. His work has been the subject of controversy in the United States. In 1990, his San Francisco studio was raided by FBI officers and his equipment seized. A grand jury subsequently declined to bring an indictment against him. In 1998, unsuccessful attempts were made to have his books The Last Day of Summer and Radiant Identities classed as child pornography in Arkansas and Louisiana. Customers in Alabama and Tennessee sued Barnes & Noble for stocking the books, resulting in protests throughout the United States, largely inspired by conservative radio host Randall Terry. His photographs appear as cover art on three novels by Jennifer McMahon, Promise Not to Tell, Island of Lost Girls and Dismantled, as well as Karl Ove Knausg√•rd's 1998 debut novel Ute av verden (Out of the World).

He was noted as much for his short stature as for his valour and ferocity on the battlefield. Yue Jin participated in most of Cao Cao's early military exploits, and gained multiple successes in the campaigns against L√º Bu, Liu Bei, remnants of the Yellow Turban rebels, and Yuan Shao and his associates. He was particularly praised as a capable vanguard, but his most famed accomplishment came with his supporting role in the defence of Hefei against Sun Quan's forces at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford of 214‚Äì215. Chen Shou, who wrote the third-century historical text Sanguozhi, named Yue Jin as one of the Five Elite Generals of his time, alongside Yu Jin, Zhang He, Zhang Liao and Xu Huang.(Ë©ïÊõ∞ÔºöÂ§™Á•ñÂª∫Ëå≤Ê≠¶ÂäüÔºåËÄåÊôÇ‰πãËâØÂ∞áÔºå‰∫îÂ≠êÁÇ∫ÂÖà„ÄÇ‰∫éÁ¶ÅÊúÄËôüÊØÖÈáçÔºåÁÑ∂ÂºóÂÖãÂÖ∂ÁµÇ„ÄÇÂºµÈÉÉ‰ª•Â∑ßËÆäÁÇ∫Á®±ÔºåÊ®ÇÈÄ≤‰ª•È©çÊûúÈ°ØÂêçÔºåËÄåÈëíÂÖ∂Ë°å‰∫ãÔºåÊú™ÂâØÊâÄËÅû„ÄÇÊàñÊ≥®Ë®òÊúâÈÅ∫ÊºèÔºåÊú™Â¶ÇÂºµÈÅº„ÄÅÂæêÊôÉ‰πãÂÇôË©≥‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17.

Around early 190, when Cao Cao was raising troops to join the campaign against the warlord Dong Zhuo who controlled the Han central government, Yue Jin was tasked to recruit soldiers for Cao Cao's camp, in which he brought back 1,000 men from his hometown. For his effort, Yue Jin was put into test as an acting Major () and Formation Breaking Commandant ().(ÈÅ£ÈÇÑÊú¨ÈÉ°ÂãüÂÖµÔºåÂæóÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÈÇÑÁÇ∫ËªçÂÅáÂè∏È¶¨„ÄÅÈô∑Èô£ÈÉΩÂ∞â„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17. Solidifying Cao Cao's position In 194, the warlord L√º Bu occupied Cao Cao's base, Yan Province, with help from defectors from Cao Cao's side when Cao Cao was away on a campaign against Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province. Yue Jin and Cao Hong were assigned to lead the vanguard when Cao Cao's army returned to take back Yan Province. Cao Cao and L√º Bu fought several battles around Puyang, resulting in mainly defeats for Cao Cao, but Yue Jin's contributions in those battles were still recognised by his superior. Yue Jin also participated in Cao Cao's battles against Zhang Chao at Yongqiu (Èõç‰∏ò; present-day Qi County, Henan) and Qiao Rui () at Ku County (Ëã¶Á∏£; present-day Luyi County, Henan), in which he served as the vanguard and was the first to break the enemy's defences in both battles.

Between 197 and 198, Yue Jin followed Cao Cao to subdue Zhang Xiu, who feigned surrender and defeated Cao Cao at the Battle of Wancheng. Much hardships were experienced during the campaign, but Yue Jin, along Yu Jin, was recorded to have earned merit during the battles. Due to the fact that Zhang Xiu was backed by Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, Cao Cao realised that Zhang Xiu could not be defeated within a short period of time. Under the rationale that Liu Bei was asking for help in Xiaopei (Â∞èÊ≤õ; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) to fight L√º Bu, Cao Cao finally relinquished his war against Zhang Xiu, and sent envoys to ask Zhang Xiu to form an alliance, which Zhang Xiu agreed upon the term that a marriage be arranged between the two families. During the siege of Xiapi, Yue Jin led a separate command and defeated one of L√º Bu's deputies outside the city before he joined the encirclement.(ÂæûÂæÅÂºµÁπ°ÊñºÂÆâË°ÜÔºåÂúçÂëÇÂ∏ÉÊñº‰∏ãÈÇ≥ÔºåÁ†¥Âà•Â∞áÔºå ...) Sanguozhi vol. 17. After L√º Bu's defeat and death, Cao Cao focused on preparation to the upcoming war with his rival Yuan Shao, and Yue Jin was assigned to the border. When the warlord of Bing Province, Zhang Yang, vacillated on the predicament upon choosing Cao Cao or Yuan Shao as his ally, his subordinate Yang Chou () murdered him and took his head to Cao Cao. However, Sui Gu (), a former Heishan bandit, killed Yang Chou when he was on his way to the imperial capital Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan). In order to merge Zhang Yang's remnants, Yue Jin intercepted Sui Gu when the latter attempted to go back north, and successfully hunted down his prey and took control of the Bing Province troops. He then brought his troops to join Cao Cao's eastern campaign against Liu Bei, who had just killed Che Zhou (), the Governor of Xu Province, and taken control of the province. Within a very short time, Liu Bei was defeated, and his aide, Guan Yu, was captured alive. Yue Jin was promoted to Colonel Who Attacks Bandits () for his achievements.(...

Cao Cao's northern campaign =Skirmishes= Yue Jin participated in the pivotal Battle of Guandu in 200, in which Cao Cao pitted his forces against those of his rival, Yuan Shao. Before Cao Cao led the main army to the frontline, Yue Jin was assigned several thousand soldiers to reinforce Yu Jin at Yan Ford (Âª∂Ê¥•; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan). After rendezvousing with Yu Jin, they selected 5,000 elite soldiers composed of infantry and cavalry, and raided Yuan Shao's detached encampments along the Yellow River southwest from Yan Ford. They snaked up to as far as Ji County (Ê±≤Á∏£; 25 li southwest of present-day Weihui, Henan), and crossed the river to raid Huojia County to the north. In all, they had set fire to some 30 enemy camps, killed thousands of enemies, captured several thousand men alive, and forced the surrender of some 20 officers, including He Mao () and Wang Mo ().(Ê∏°Ê≤≥ÊîªÁç≤ÂòâÔºåÈÇÑÔºå ...) Sanguozhi vol. 17. =Major engagements= Later on, Cao Cao ordered Yu Jin to camp at Yuanwu County (ÂéüÊ≠¶Á∏£; present-day Yuanyang County, Henan) and summoned Yue Jin back. A series of engagements were fought, and some of Yuan Shao's top generals had been killed, but Yuan Shao still possessed a huge army, which put much pressure on Cao Cao. The war had been dragging on for months, and Cao Cao's supplies nearly depleted. When Cao Cao considered retreating, he received a piece of intelligence concerning the whereabouts of his enemy's food storage, which was guarded by Yuan Shao's general Chunyu Qiong. Determined to bet on the information, he picked Yue Jin as his vanguard in this desperate mission, and sneaked their way to Wuchao (ÁÉèÂ∑¢; in present-day Yanjin, Henan) with 5,000 troops composed of mainly cavalry. Under the cover of night, they were unopposed until they arrived the enemy encampment, where they set fire to Yuan Shao's supplies. Chunyu Qiong attempted to fight back with his larger force, but was slain by Yue Jin in the chaos. The success of this raid in Wuchao enabled Cao Cao to score a decisive victory over Yuan Shao's at Guandu.(... ÂæûÊìäË¢ÅÁ¥πÊñºÂÆòÊ∏°ÔºåÂäõÊà∞ÔºåÊñ¨Á¥πÂ∞áÊ∑≥‰∫éÁìä„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17. After the ultimate defeat and subsequent death of Yuan Shao, Cao Cao marched his troops northwards into Ji Province and You Province to stamp out Yuan Shao's heirs and supporters. Cao Cao's progress was checked at the Battle of Liyang (ÈªéÈôΩ; northeast of present- day Xun County, Henan), where the war entered a stalemate when the two forces fought on the open field.Sanguozhi vol. 6. Yue Jin then targeted the unit of Yan Jing (), an officer under Yuan Shang, routed it. Yan Jing's defeat frightened the Yuan brothers, who went back into the city and fled during the night. Yue was promoted to acting Guerrilla General (). He then followed Cao Cao to besiege Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei) and breached the city's walls. During the Battle of Nanpi, Yuan Tan personally led a counter- offensive, and inflicted considerable damage to Cao Cao's elite cavalry force: the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry (). Nevertheless, Yue Jin climbed the city wall and opened the east gate, and the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry took its revenge by taking Yuan Tan's head.(ÂæûÊìäË≠ö„ÄÅÂ∞öÊñºÈªéÈôΩÔºåÊñ¨ÂÖ∂Â§ßÂ∞áÂö¥Êï¨ÔºåË°åÊ∏∏ÊìäÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇÂà•ÊìäÈªÉÂ∑æÔºåÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÂÆöÊ®ÇÂÆâÈÉ°„ÄÇÂæûÂúçÈÑ¥ÔºåÈÑ¥ÂÆöÔºåÂæûÊìäË¢ÅË≠öÊñºÂçóÁöÆÔºåÂÖàÁôªÔºåÂÖ•Ë≠öÊù±ÈñÄ„ÄÇË≠öÊïóÔºåÂà•ÊîªÈõçÂ•¥ÔºåÁ†¥‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17.

When the reinforcements led by Cao Cao arrived, they breached the pass and killed every defender. Later, Yue Jin and Li Dian were assigned as vanguards to attack a pirate force led by Guan Cheng (), whom they defeated and forced into surrender. As Jing Province (covering present- day Hubei and Hunan) had yet to be pacified, Cao Cao ordered Yue Jin to garrison at Yangzhai County (ÈôΩÁøüÁ∏£; present-day Yuzhou, Henan) later.(ÈÄ≤Âà•ÂæÅÈ´òÂππÔºåÂæûÂåóÈÅìÂÖ•‰∏äÈª®ÔºåÂõûÂá∫ÂÖ∂Âæå„ÄÇÂππÁ≠âÈÇÑÂÆàÂ£∫ÈóúÔºåÈÄ£Êà∞Êñ¨È¶ñ„ÄÇÂππÂ†ÖÂÆàÊú™‰∏ãÔºåÊúÉÂ§™Á•ñËá™ÂæÅ‰πãÔºå‰πÉÊãî„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÂæÅÁÆ°ÊâøÔºåËªçÊ∑≥‰∫éÔºåÈÅ£ÈÄ≤ËàáÊùéÂÖ∏Êìä‰πã„ÄÇÊâøÁ†¥Ëµ∞ÔºåÈÄÉÂÖ•Êµ∑Â≥∂ÔºåÊµ∑ÊøµÂπ≥ÔºåËçäÂ∑ûÊú™ÊúçÔºåÈÅ£Â±ØÈôΩÁøü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17. War with Sun Quan After Cao Cao successfully unified central and northern China under his control in 208, he assembled an army to attack Liu Bei, who had allied with the warlord Sun Quan, who controlled the Jiangdong region in southern China. However, he was decisively defeated by the allies at the Battle of Red Cliffs later that year and was forced to retreat north. =Battle of Jiangling= As a result of the disastrous defeat at the Red Cliffs, Cao Cao's huge army was scattered around the northern plain above the Yangtze River. Yue Jin was ordered to station inside the city of Xiangyang, in anticipation of counterstrikes by Sun Quan's general Zhou Yu. When Liu Bei's general Guan Yu was attempting to cut the connection between Jiangling County and Xiangyang, he was stymied by Yue Jin, who led his army out and defeated him. During Guan Yu's second attempt to block the waterway of Xiangyang, Yue Jin attacked Guan Yu again on the water near Xiakou (Â§èÂè£; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei) and drove him away.(ÂæåÂæûÂπ≥ËçäÂ∑ûÔºåÁïôÂ±ØË•ÑÈôΩÔºåÊìäÈóúÁæΩ„ÄÅËòáÈùûÁ≠âÔºåÁöÜËµ∞‰πãÔºå ...)

After receiving intelligence that Cao Cao had come in person, Sun Quan retreated, and Yue Jin, alongside Zhang Liao and Li Dian were left for the defence of Hefei with 7,000 soldiers. Later, Sun Quan led 100,000 naval forces and advanced to Hefei. Sun Quan's forces bypassed a 300,000 strong army led by Xiahou Dun. Following a direct order from Cao Cao, Xue Ti () led a relief force into the city, and also served as a monitoring system to the three generals, who were not in good terms with each other. Yue Jin was ordered to stay behind to defend the city with Xue Ti ‚Äì who actually assumed a higher command than Zhang Liao, and was there to ensure that the three generals executed Cao Cao's orders ‚Äì while Li Dian and Zhang Liao led a force of 800 men out to engage the enemy. Sun Quan lost two generals on the first encounter, but his army managed to force Zhang Liao and Li Dian back into the fortified citadel. However, Sun Quan's forces were unable to breach the walls of Hefei, and were subsequently infected with a plague. Thus, Sun Quan grudgingly withdrew; in order to avoid being infected, Sun Quan only had 1,000 troops with him on the northern part of Xiaoyao Ford (). This piece of news was received by Zhang Liao, who immediately led several thousand elite cavalry to pursue the enemy commander. During the chaos, Sun Quan was nearly killed if not saved by his general Ling Tong, and the siege of Hefei came to a complete victory for Cao Cao's side. Yue Jin was promoted to General of the Right () for his contributions in the defence of Hefei.(Â§™Á•ñÈÇÑÔºåÁïôÈÄ≤ËàáÂºµÈÅº„ÄÅÊùéÂÖ∏Â±ØÂêàËÇ•ÔºåÂ¢ûÈÇë‰∫îÁôæÔºåÂπ∂ÂâçÂá°ÂçÉ‰∫åÁôæÊà∂„ÄÇ‰ª•ÈÄ≤Êï∏ÊúâÂäüÔºåÂàÜ‰∫îÁôæÊà∂ÔºåÂ∞Å‰∏ÄÂ≠êÂàó‰æØÔºõÈÄ≤ÈÅ∑Âè≥Â∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 17.

He served as a military officer in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. In 255, when the Wei generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a rebellion in Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Yue Lin served as a subordinate of the Wei regent Sima Shi, who led troops to Shouchun to suppress the revolt. Sima Shi ordered another subordinate Sima Lian () to lead 8,000 riders to pursue Wen Qin while he was retreating after his defeat; Sima Shi also ordered Yue Lin to lead infantry and follow behind Sima Lian to provide backup.(Â∏ùÈÅ£Â∑¶Èï∑Âè≤Âè∏È¶¨ÁíâÁù£È©çÈ®éÂÖ´ÂçÉÁøºËÄåËøΩ‰πãÔºå‰ΩøÂ∞áËªçÊ®ÇÁ∂ùÁ≠âÁù£Ê≠•ÂÖµÁπºÂÖ∂Âæå„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 2.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Yue Jin is featured as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which dramatises the events leading to, and during the Three Kingdoms period. However, his role in the novel was largely downplayed, and his achievements in battle were not as prominent as those described in his historical biography. He often appeared together with Li Dian. Yue Jin first appeared in Chapter 5, in which he joined Cao Cao's forces when the latter was rallying an army to participate in the campaign against Dong Zhuo.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 5. In Chapter 11, when Cao Cao was at war with L√º Bu, Yue Jin engaged L√º Bu's general Zang Ba in a duel but neither of them could defeat his opponent after fighting for more than 30 rounds.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 11. In Chapter 23, Cao Cao praised four of his generals ‚Äì Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, Yue Jin and Li Dian ‚Äì in front of Mi Heng, saying that the four of them \\"possessed unwavering courage and surpassed Cen Peng (Â≤ëÂΩ≠) and Ma Wu (È¶¨Ê≠¶).\\"Sanguo Yanyi ch. 23. Yue Jin was also described to be a skilful archer in the novel. There were two incidents which showcased his skill: in Chapter 12, he fired an arrow at L√º Bu's general Cheng Lian () and killed him;Sanguo Yanyi ch. 12. in Chapter 33, he killed Yuan Tan's adviser Guo Tu with a single arrow shot when Guo was attempting to escape after his defeat.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 33. In Chapter 53, during a battle against Sun Quan's forces, Yue Jin was described as \\"armed with only a sword and on horseback, he charged towards Sun Quan like a bolt of lightning, and raised his sword and slashed down when he reached his target.\\" Sun Quan's subordinates Song Qian and Jia Hua () used their jis to block Yue Jin but their jis were split apart by Yue Jin's sword, so they used the handles to hit Yue Jin's horse.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 53. In Chapter 68, in an engagement after the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, Yue Jin duelled with Sun Quan's general Ling Tong for more than 50 rounds but neither of them won. Cao Xiu then fired an arrow at Ling Tong, which hit Ling's horse and caused him to be thrown off his horse. Yue Jin then moved in for the kill, but before he could slay Ling Tong, he was hit in the face by an arrow fired by Gan Ning. Both sides then rushed forth to rescue their respective generals. Cao Cao later ordered Yue Jin to be carried into his tent for medical treatment.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 68. Yue Jin did not appear again in the novel after Chapter 68. In popular culture Yue Jin is first introduced as a playable character in the eighth instalment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series.

He even wrote purported letters from biblical figures in French. Denis Vrain- Lucas was trained as a law clerk, but by 1854 he had begun to forge historical documents, especially letters. Lucas began by using writing material and self- made inks from the appropriate period and forged mainly documents from French authors. He collected historical details from the Imperial library. As his forgeries were more readily accepted, he began to produce letters from historical figures. In 1861 Vrain-Lucas approached French mathematician and collector Michel Chasles and sold him forged letters for Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton and Blaise Pascal. In one of them Pascal supposedly claimed that he had discovered the laws of gravity before Newton. Since this would have meant that a Frenchman would have discovered gravity before an Englishman, Chasles accepted the letter and asked for more. Lucas proceeded to sell him hundreds of letters from historical and biblical figures, using contemporary French. Over 16 years Vrain-Lucas forged total of 27,000 autographs, letters, and other documents from such luminaries as Mary Magdalene, Cleopatra, Judas Iscariot, Pontius Pilate, Joan of Arc, Cicero and Dante Alighieri - written in contemporary French and on watermarked paper. The most prominent French collectors bought them, helping Lucas accumulate a significant wealth of hundreds of thousands of francs. In 1867 Chasles approached the French Academy of Science, claiming to have proof that Pascal had discovered gravity before Newton. When he showed them the letters, scholars of the Academy noticed that the handwriting was very different compared to letters that were definitely by Pascal. Chasles defended the letters' authenticity but was eventually forced to reveal that Vrain-Lucas had sold them to him. When Academy members complained about the anachronisms in the letters, Vrain-Lucas had to forge more letters to explain away his earlier mistakes. Debate continued on to 1868 and the next year he was arrested for forgery. In the following trial Chasles had to testify how he had been duped, how he had purchased large numbers of other forged letters and how he had paid total of 140,000-150,000 francs for them. In February 1870, the Correctional Tribunal of Paris sentenced Vrain- Lucas to two years in prison for forgery. He also had to pay a fine for 500 francs and all legal costs. Chasles received no restitution for all the money he had wasted on the Vrain-Lucas forgeries. After his sentence Lucas disappeared from the public eye. In 2004, the journal Critical Inquiry published a recently \\"discovered\\" 1871 letter written by Vrain-Lucas (from prison) to Chasles, conveying Vrain-Lucas's perspective on these events,Ken Alder, \\"History's Greatest Forger: Science, Fiction, and Fraud Along the Seine,\\" Critical Inquiry 30 (Summer 2004):704-716. itself an invention.Anne H.

They were removed from their mother's custody at birth to be studied by Soviet physiologists. Their mother was told that her daughters had died soon after their birth. Biography Masha and Dasha's mother, Yekaterina Krivoshlyapova, did not know she was having twins and spent two days and nights giving birth naturally. The doctors told her she had delivered a mutant (—É—Ä–æ–¥) and she was not shown the babies. They were born joined at the waist at a 180-degree angle with two heads, two torsos, four arms and one leg each, and a third, vestigial limb at their back that had some movement.  Early life  The Soviet physiologist Pyotr Anokhin was studying the separate roles of the nervous system and the blood system on the body's ability to adjust to conditions such as prolonged sleep deprivation, extreme hunger, and extreme temperature change. Conjoined twins who shared a blood system but had separate nervous systems were ideal objects for research. He had put out an alert to all maternity hospitals in the USSR to be informed if any conjoined twins were born, and began studying Masha and Dasha within days of their birth. When the twins were born, their mother was told they required full-time care from the State. She agreed, but on the condition that she would keep custody and visit them regularly. A night nurse brought the twins in to see their mother and let her hold them. Scientists did not want her to keep custody of them so she was later told by one of Anokhin's physiologists that they had died of pneumonia. In reality, the twins had been taken to the Institute of Experimental Medicine in Moscow to be studied and experimented on under laboratory conditions. The Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences produced a documentary film detailing the research. In Autumn 1950, under Stalin's rule, Anokhin was exiled for two years for his anti-Soviet views on genetics (which taught Lysenkoism and Lamarckian evolution rather than Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution). The twins were placed in the Academy of Medical Sciences Pediatric Institute, where a team of Anokhin's physiologists continued to carry out experiments on them for the following six years; Masha and Dasha's case is now considered a prolonged case of medical torture. Experiments included packing one twin in ice to bring their temperature down to near-fatal levels while observing temperature changes in the other twin, burning them, starving them, depriving them of sleep and electrocuting them in time with a metronome to test their reflexes. Their lung, heart and brain activity was constantly monitored by pneumograms, electrocardiograms and encephalograms. Tubes were routinely inserted into their stomachs to monitor gastric juices and blood was taken from them three times a day. In 1956 they were transferred to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (TSNIIPP) (–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ-–∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ–∑–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è) in Moscow where they were taught to walk and given an elementary education. They were kept hidden from the public in a children's ward there for the following eight years.  Education  In 1964, news spread to Moscow that a girl with two heads was being kept in the Institute. As a result, the twins were transferred to a boarding school for children with motor-impairment in Novocherkassk, southern Russia, to continue their education. They studied here for four years in what they later recalled was the happiest time of their lives. In 1968 their third leg was amputated in an effort to make them less noticeable to the Soviet public, who were not used to seeing disabled people. The twins had by now developed very different personalities, with Masha being dominant, tomboyish and cheeky, and Dasha submissive, thoughtful and quiet. Dasha fell in love with a fellow student, but Masha put a stop to the romance. Dasha fell into a depression and tried to hang herself when the pair were 18. This coincided with having been told by a medical commission which graded disability that they had been placed in the lowest grade, which meant that they would be kept for life in a retirement home (there were no homes for the disabled as the Soviet Union saw 'invalids' as flaws in the system) with no right to work or be independent in any way. In 1989, aged 39, they moved into the 20th Home for Veterans of War and Labour and lived there in a small room with a single bed for the next fourteen years. They earned pocket money sewing diapers and assembling pipettes. They found their birth mother Yekaterina Krivoshlyapova in 1985 and she visited them for four years before Masha broke off the connection. They were visited every week by ‚ÄòAunty Nadya‚Äô ‚Äì Nadezhda Gorokhova ‚Äì their physiotherapist in TSNIIPP, who befriended them throughout their lives. With the coming of Gorbachev‚Äôs campaign of openness, or glasnost, they made an appeal on a national television chat show Vzglyad in 1988, to be allowed to leave the 20th Home which was being turned into a mental asylum. The appeal was successful and they moved to the 6th Home for Veterans of Labour with greatly improved living conditions and bought themselves luxuries such as a television set, an Atari, a music cassette player and a computer on the proceeds of charitable contributions.  Later life  They were also able to buy alcohol and over the next decade the twins became alcoholics - only Dasha drank, Masha was unable to because of a gag reflex. Because they shared the same blood supply, both would become inebriated. They made many attempts to stop drinking, which included hypnotism, magic spells and being 'sewn up', a process whereby a capsule (containing a nocebo chemical which would supposedly kill them upon inebriation) was inserted surgically under their skin. The pair visited Cologne, Germany, in August 1991. However, the trip was cut short following the Soviet coup attempt to overthrow Gorbachev. They befriended a British journalist, Juliet Butler, in 1988. The twins and Butler's family became close friends over the next twelve years, and she collaborated with them in appearing in a BBC Horizon documentary on conjoined twins in 1999. Butler also helped write their autobiography, which was published in Germany in 2000. She wrote a novel based on their life story called 'The Less you Know, The Sounder You Sleep' which was published in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, South Africa and the Netherlands in 2017. British Surgeon Lewis Spitz, who specialised in operating on conjoined twins, offered to separate them in London, but Masha was against the procedure. = Death = Masha fell ill on the 13th of April, 2003, complaining of back pain. She died the following day, on the 14th of April, seventeen hours after the onset of her symptoms. Dasha was taken to the First City Hospital and died another seventeen hours later due to blood poisoning from the toxic by-products of Masha's decomposing body. At the time of their death they were the oldest living conjoined twins in the world. The pair were cremated and their remains lie in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

He continued serving in the state of Eastern Wu during the early Three Kingdoms period. Life in the Eastern Han dynasty =Early career under Yuan Shu= L√º Fan was from Xiyang County (), Runan Commandery (), which is around present-day Taihe County, Anhui. He married a woman from a certain Liu family. He started his career as a minor official under the warlord Yuan Shu. During this time, he met Sun Ce, a general under Yuan Shu, and became close friends with him. Since then, he had accompanied Sun Ce on the battles he fought under Yuan Shu's banner, and later in the battles that Sun Ce fought as a warlord in his own right. It is said that L√º Fan recommended himself to Sun Ce through a game of weiqi ‚Äì after Sun Ce made a bad opening move, L√º Fan capitalised on it and pointed out the mistake. Sun Ce was suitably impressed and offered L√º Fan a post. Rather than accept a high and lofty position, however, L√º Fan insisted upon remaining in a low one where he could more effectively manage troops. Sun Ce was further impressed and since then the two became inseparable. The game of weiqi in question, called the \\"Sun-L√º Game\\", is purported to be the first weiqi game to be recorded move for move, but many scholars doubt its authenticity. After this, L√º Fan was appointed as a Chief Controller. =Career under Sun Ce= At one point during the beginning of Sun Ce's career as a warlord, he sent L√º Fan to fetch his family from Guangling Commandery in Xu Province to his new base in Qu'e County. Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province, despised Sun Ce and wanted to have L√º Fan arrested as a spy and tortured, but some of his retainers freed L√º Fan and helped him escape from Guangling Commandery with Sun Ce's family. Sun Ce trusted L√º Fan so highly that he treated him like a member of the Sun family and even allowed L√º Fan to dine in the presence of his mother, Lady Wu. L√º Fan was third only to Cheng Pu and Xu Kun in terms of merit, having followed Sun Ce in his conquests in the Jiangdong region from 194 to 199. His unit defeated and killed Yan Baihu's subordinate, Chen Mu. However, L√º Fan was concerned about the quality of Sun Ce's army. He feared that though their forces had grown, it comprised mostly untrained rabble with just a few veterans supporting them. L√º Fan believed that such an army could achieve limited success at best. As such, he requested that Sun Ce transfer him to his personal staff and make him the commander of his forces. Though this title eventually came to hold a great deal of authority, at the time a marshal was simply a minor staff officer responsible for training and drilling the troops. As he saw that this was a demotion for L√º Fan, Sun Ce tried to talk L√º Fan out of it, but the latter insisted and managed to convince Sun Ce to agree to his request. L√º Fan thus took charge of training Sun Ce's troops. As Sun Ce was the supreme commander of the military forces in the Jiangdong region, L√º Fan's authority extended to the units under the command of Sun Ce's subordinates, effectively giving him control over the entire military administration in Jiangdong. Under L√º Fan's training, Sun Ce's forces became a well-trained, highly disciplined fighting force which was vastly superior to the conscripted armies of other warlords. In his oversight, L√º Fan was strict but fair. He ensured that his troops obeyed all military regulations, and as he was not cruel or excessive, the troops did not resent him. In 197, when Yuan Shu declared himself emperor ‚Äì an act deemed treasonous against the figurehead Emperor Xian of the Han dynasty ‚Äì Sun Ce broke ties with Yuan Shu and joined other warlords in a two-year-long campaign against the pretender. Chen Yu, who was sent by the warlord Cao Cao to assist Sun Ce in the campaign against Yuan Shu, secretly plotted to destroy Sun Ce from within. However, Sun Ce sensed Chen Yu's intentions and sent L√º Fan to deal with him. L√º Fan defeated Chen Yu in battle and forced him to retreat north. Around 199, after defeating Yuan Shu's remnants, the minor warlord Liu Xun, as well as Huang Zu and Liu Biao at the Battle of Sha County, Sun Ce wrote a memorial to the Han central government to recommend L√º Fan to be the Administrator of Guiyang Commandery, among other things. =Career under Sun Quan= Following Sun Ce's death in the year 200, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him and took control over his territories and forces in the Jiangdong region. Like his brother before him, Sun Quan highly trusted L√º Fan even though they previously had some disagreements ‚Äì Sun Quan, being young and foolhardy, often embezzled official funds for his personal interests and expected L√º Fan to cover up for him. L√º Fan, however, remained honest and reported Sun Quan's behaviour to Sun Ce, causing Sun Quan to dislike him. Nevertheless, as Sun Quan grew older and became more mature, he started to see L√º Fan in a different light and admired his honesty. In 208, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government, led a massive army to attack his rivals, Liu Bei and Sun Quan, in southern China. Sun Quan heeded the advice of Zhou Yu and Lu Su, and decided to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao. L√º Fan participated in the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208‚Äì209 under Zhou Yu's command; the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei defeated Cao Cao's larger army in this decisive battle. After the victory at Red Cliffs, Lu Su suggested to Sun Quan to \\"lend\\" his territories in southern Jing Province to Liu Bei as a temporary base. Zhou Yu and L√º Fan strongly objected to Lu Su's suggestion and argued that Liu Bei would not return the territories. After Zhou Yu's death in 210, Sun Quan agreed to Lu Su's idea and even made additional territorial concessions to Liu Bei. Life in the Three Kingdoms period L√º Fan continued serving under Sun Quan after the end of the Eastern Han dynasty in 220. Although Sun Quan initially agreed to be a vassal king under the Cao Wei state (established by Cao Cao's successor Cao Pi), he broke ties with Cao Pi and declared independence in 222 as the ruler of his own Eastern Wu regime. In 223, L√º Fan led the Wu forces during the Battle of Dongkou against Wei forces led by Cao Xiu and Zang Ba. The situation was highly unfavourable for Wu at the beginning: the Wu fleet came under heavy attack and much of the fleet was destroyed in a storm. To add on to their troubles, Sun Lang, a younger half-brother of Sun Quan, accidentally burnt down the Wu forces' supply of food and weaponry. However, due to the efforts of L√º Fan's subordinates Sun Shao and Xu Sheng, the Wu forces were able to stage a counterattack and barely win the battle. After the Battle of Dongkou, Sun Quan appointed L√º Fan as the Governor of Yang Province. In 228, he further promoted L√º Fan to the position of Grand Marshal, but L√º Fan, who was already critically ill then, died of illness before assuming his new appointment. Sun Quan wept bitterly upon learning of L√º Fan's death and called his name repeatedly. Family L√º Fan had at least two sons. The elder one, whose name is not recorded in history, died early. The younger one, L√º Ju, inherited his father's marquis title and rose through the ranks to become General of Agile Cavalry () during the reign of the second Wu emperor, Sun Liang.

It is the site of the oldest known Roman colony on the Rhine. Founding A statue of Plancus, the city's founder, in the city hall of Basel, Switzerland. Augusta Raurica, or Colonia Augusta Rauracorum, was founded by Lucius Munatius Plancus around 44 BC in the vicinity of a local Gallic tribe, the Rauraci, relatives of the Helvetii. No archaeological evidence from this period has yet been found, leading to the conclusion that, either the settlement of the colony was disturbed by the civil war following the death of Julius Caesar, or that Plancus' colony was actually in the area of modern Basel, not Augst. Successful colonization of the site had to wait for Augustus' conquest of the central Alps around 15 BC. The oldest find to date at Augusta Raurica has been dated to 6 BC by dendrochronology. Name Gravestone from Cirencester for a civis Rauricus. The inscription on Munatius Plancus' grave merely states the name of the colony as Colonia Raurica. A fragmentary inscription from the Augustinian period speaks of the Colonia P[aterna] (?) M[unatia] (?) [Felix] (?) [Apolli]naris [Augusta E]merita [Raur]ica (letters in brackets are reconstructions). Apart from this fragmentary reference, the first certain witness to the use of the name Augustus comes from the geographer Ptolemy in the Ancient Greek form Aug√∫sta Raur√≠kon (lat. Augusta Rauricorum). Augusta Raurica played an important role in Augustus' plans of conquest with two other colonies that bear his name: Augusta Praetoria (modern Aosta at the southern end of the Great Saint Bernard Pass) and Augusta Vindelicum (modern Augsburg, an outpost on the Danube). These three Augustae form the corners of a triangle that reaches across the alpine conquests of Augustus, the long base of which form the Rhine knee to the Danube formed the frontier against unconquered Germania. Layout of the settlement Augusta Raurica around 240 AD During excavations it was determined that the city was founded on a high plateau just south of the Rhine river. Two small rivers, the Ergolz and Violen, have carved a triangle in the plateau, the base of which is about 1 kilometer wide along the base of the Jura Mountains, and the apex points northward toward the Rhine, about 1 kilometer from the base. This point is the site of the Roman castrum, or military fortification. The city is, therefore, well-defended by steep slopes to the north, east, and west. Temple at Augusta Raurica The next step in planning the city was the surveying of the area according to the architect's plans for the city. Every important public building had its specific place, starting with the temple of Jupiter as the sacred high point from which the street network would spread. The architect, who was responsible for executing the plans for the city, next laid a longitudinal axis across the triangle 36Àö west of north to form the main street of the settlement. Other longitudinal streets were laid out parallel to the main street at intervals of 55 meters. The main street was then divided into sections of 66 meters (255 Roman feet), which formed the corners of 10 crossing streets. This created a series of rectangular blocks of around 50 by 60 meters. The streets were laid on a solid bed of gravel and flanked by gutters on both sides. The more important roads featured covered sidewalks behind rows of columns. Borders Augusta Raurica and Vindonissa in the 4th century The limits of Colonia Raurica can no longer be determined with absolute accuracy. However the approximate boundaries can be determined by examining the extent of Augst in the Early Middle Ages. This would seem to indicate the colony extended from Basel toward the mouth of the Aare, then up the Aare to the mouth of the Sigger below Solothurn, across to the L√ºssel, and then back down the Birs to Basel, though this is still conjecture. New research, based on tiles stamped with the mark of the Vindonissa Legion, indicates some administrative dependence on Vindonissa. This would indicate that the colony reached over the B√∂zberg toward Frick, with the Thiersteinberg below Frick forming the eastern boundary. The western boundary, was near the mouth of the Birs, possibly marked by a border station. Early Roman cremation remains, found in 1937 by the church in Neuallschwil, show that such a post did exist on the main road north (toward Blotzheim) into Alsace. The Colonia Raurica, on the whole, contained the modern Canton of Basel, the Frick valley, and the eastern Jura Mountains of the Canton of Solothurn. The total area of the colony was around 700 km¬≤. Subsequent history Remains of amphitheatre at Augusta Raurica By the 2nd century AD, Augusta Raurica was a prosperous commercial trading centre and, in its glory days, the capital of a local Roman province. It is estimated that the population reached approximately 20,000 people. Augusta Raurica prospered between the 1st and 3rd centuries, and exported smoked pork and bacon to other parts of the Roman Empire. The city possessed the typical amenities of a Roman city, an amphitheatre, a main forum, several smaller forums, an aqueduct, a variety of temples, several public baths and the largest Roman theatre north of the Alps, with 8,000 to 10,000 seats. Many of these sites are open to visitors year-round. Castrum Rauracense In 250 AD, a powerful earthquake damaged a large part of the city. Shortly after, around 260 AD, Alemanni tribes and/or marauding Roman troops destroyed the city. The Romans attempted to maintain their military position by building a fortress on the Rhine, Castrum Rauracense, the walls of which are still partly intact. Augusta Raurica was resettled on a much smaller scale on the site of the castrum. These two settlements form the centers of the modern communities of Augst and Kaiseraugst. In 1442, these communities were divided along the Ergolz and rivers. The western portion was given to Basel, which became a canton of Switzerland in 1501. In 1833, Augst became part of the Canton of Basel-Land. The eastern part became part of Habsburg territories and, to differentiate between the two towns, was renamed Kaiseraugst. Kaiseraugst became part of Switzerland in 1803 after the defeat of the Habsburgs during the Napoleonic Wars. Augusta Raurica today Basilica at Augusta Raurica The excavation site and the late Roman castle, the Castrum Rauracense, are listed as heritage sites of national significance, as are the early Christian baptisterium and the brick kiln at Liebr√ºti.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 39. =Excavations= Many of the Roman buildings have been discovered and conserved through excavations, and most are open to the public: * Amphitheatre: only modest remains exist. * Aqueduct: supplied Augusta Raurica with drinking water from the Liestal (parts are visible and accessible in Heidenloch in Liestal, as well as northeast of the treatment plant in F√ºllinsdorf). * Main forum: with the temple of Jupiter, basilica, and the assembly chamber of the town council. * Theater: forms an architectural unit with the temple across the street. Several private commercial buildings also have been found (a taberna, a bakery, a potter, and a tile kiln), as well as portions of a sewer. Around 80% of the built-up area has yet to be excavated. Augusta Raurica is the best-preserved Roman city north of the Alps that has not been built-over in medieval or modern times. =Museum and Roman house= Silver treasure of Kaiseraugst The Roman Museum houses the most important finds from the Roman city and presents the history of Augusta Raurica. In the museum, visitors will often find special exhibits, as well as most the significant archaeological find at Augusta Raurica: the silver treasure of Kaiseraugst. This treasure hoard was found in the fortress in 1961‚Äì1962, and it is presumed to have once been the property of a commander. The museum also has a reconstruction of a Roman house, with artifacts and reconstructions showing daily domestic and commercial life from the Roman period.

In describing a person or machine, idle means the act of nothing or no work (for example: \\"John Smith is an idle person\\"). This is a person who spends his days doing nothing could be said to be \\"idly passing his days.\\" (For example: Mary has been idle on her instant messenger account for hours.) A computer processor or communication circuit is described as idle when it is not being used by any program, application or message. Similarly, an engine of an automobile may be described as idle when it is running only to sustain its running (not doing any useful work), this is also called the tickover (see idle).  Idleness as dependent upon cultural norms  Typically, when one describes a machine as idle, it is an objective statement regarding its current state. However, when used to describe a person, idle typically carries a negative connotation, with the assumption that the person is wasting their time by doing nothing of value. Such a view is reflected in the proverb \\"an idle mind is the devil's workshop\\". Also, the popular phrase \\"killing time\\" refers to idleness and can be defined as spending time doing nothing in particular in order that time seems to pass more quickly. These interpretations of idleness are not universal ‚Äì they are more typically associated with Western cultures. Idleness was considered a disorderly offence in England punishable as a summary offense.\\"ANOTHER branch of ≈øummary proceedings is that before ju≈øtices of the peace, in order to inflict divers petty pecuniary mulcts, and corporal penalties, denounced by act of parliament for many di≈øorderly offences; ≈øuch as common ≈øwearing, drunkenne≈øs, vagrancy, idlene≈øs, and a va≈øt variety of others, for which I mu≈øt refer the ≈øtudent to the ju≈øtice-books formerly cited, and which u≈øed to be formerly puni≈øhed by the verdict of a jury in the court-leet.\\" Commentaries on the Laws of England, Sir William Blackstone Involuntary enforced idleness is the punishment used for lazy or slacking workers in zero-hour contracts. Paid time off, which was introduced in the 20th century as a trade unionist reform, is now absent from an increasing number of job arrangements both as a money-saving mechanism and so that only work pays and thus reinforcing the stigma against idleness and enabling nature‚Äôs punishment of idleness in the form of destitution and starvation.  Books on idleness  People idling in Kannur, India. The state of being idle is sometimes even celebrated with a few books on the subject of idleness. How to Be Idle by Tom Hodgkinson is one such example from an author who is also known for his magazine, \\"The Idler\\", devoted to promoting its ethos of \\"idle living\\". Bertrand Russell's In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays is another book that explores the virtues of being idle in the modern society. Mark Slouka published an essay, \\"Quitting the Paint Factory: The Virtues of Idleness\\", hinting at a post-scarcity economy and linking conscious busyness with anti-democratic and fascist tendencies.Slouka, Mark (2004) \\"Quitting the Paint Factory\\" Harper's Magazine, November 2004.

She was the inspiration for Marguerite Gautier, the main character of the 1848 novel La Dame aux Cam√©lias by Alexandre Dumas the younger, one of Duplessis' lovers. Much of what is known about her has been derived from the literary persona and contemporary legends.Maria Nockin \\"The Real Traviata\\" (\\"Pro Opera\\", English translation)  Early life  Marie Duplessis was born Alphonsine Rose Plessis in 1824 to Marin Plessis and Marie Plessis (n√©e Deshayes) at Nonant-le-Pin, Normandy, France. At the age of 15, she moved to Paris, where she found work in a dress shop. As recorded in art of the day Marie Duplessis was evidently an extremely attractive young woman, with a petite figure and an enchanting smile. By the time she was 16, she had become aware that prominent men were willing to give her money in exchange for her company in both private and social settings. She became a courtesan and learned to read and write, and to stay abreast of world events so as to be able to converse on these topics with her clients and at social functions. She also added the faux noble \\"Du\\" to her name.  Life as a courtesan  Passport issued to Alphonsine Plessis, January 1846 Marie Duplessis, painted by √âdouard Vi√©not Duplessis was both a popular courtesan and the hostess of a salon, where politicians, writers, and artists gathered for stimulating conversation and socializing. She rode in the Bois de Boulogne and attended opera performances. She also had her portrait painted by √âdouard Vi√©not. Duplessis was the mistress of Alexandre Dumas fils, between September 1844 and August 1845. Afterwards, she is believed to have become the mistress of composer Franz Liszt, who reportedly wished to live with her. In her short life, she gained a reputation as a discreet, intelligent, and witty lover. She remained in the good graces of many of her benefactors even after her relationships with them had ended. She was briefly married to at least one of her lovers: a French nobleman, Count √âdouard de Perregaux. Death Marie Duplessis died of tuberculosis at the age of 23 on 3 February 1847. Her husband, the comte de Perregaux, and her former lover, the Baltic-German count Gustav Ernst von Stackelberg, were by her side. Within a few weeks of her death, her belongings were auctioned off to pay her debts. Her funeral in Montmartre Cemetery in Paris was attended by hundreds of people. Novel, play, and opera Dumas' 1848 romantic novel La Dame aux Cam√©lias was based on Duplessis. It appeared within a year of her death. In the book, Dumas became \\"Armand Duval\\" and Duplessis \\"Marguerite Gautier\\". Dumas also adapted his story as a 1852 play, which inspired Giuseppe Verdi's 1853 opera La traviata and various films. The journalist Romain Vienne was a childhood friend of hers and wrote La Verit√© sur la dame aux cam√©lias to correct some of the fictions that had grown up around her.Royal Opera House Programme note to Traviata, 2019, p12 by Prof Rene Weis References Biographical Studies # Daughter of Paris: The Diary of Marie Duplessis, France's Most Celebrated Courtesan, A.

Karavangelis viewed the rivalry between the Patriarchate and Exarchate as without religious dimensions and that the main concern preoccupying Balkan states was the post-Ottoman future of in the region after the empire was removed from Macedonia. Greece at the time sent more funds, men and arms to individuals such as Karavangelis in Macedonia.Glenny, Misha. The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804-1999. London: Granta Books, 1999. p. 206. \\"in the [Macedonian] villages genuinely committed to the [Bulgarian] Exarchate of VMRO, the Greeks behaved like vengeful bullies, executing suspected renegades and holding the [Greek] Patriarchate version of the Mass at gunpoint (...). This Greek blacklash was orchestrated by the gun-toting bishop of Kastoria, Germanos Karavangelis. This extraordinary figure, (...) 'had a M√§nnlicher slung over one shoulder, a bandolier over the other, a belt round his middle from which hung his holster carrying a large pistol and a knife'. Karavangelis appeared consciously to cultivate an image of threatening romanticism. The bishop considered Bulgarian influence in the region to be the greatest threat to Greek national interests. He therefore advocated close friendship and cooperation between the Greeks and Turks of Macedonia, but only as an expedient. Karavangelis was fully aware that there was no religious aspect to the struggle between the Exarcate and the Patriarchate --he admitted openly that the only issue in Macedonia was the future contours of the Balkan states once the Turks had been thrown out.\\" Citing Douglas Dankin, The Greek struggle in Macedonia 1897-1913, Thessaloniki, 1966, p. 126. He organized armed groups composed mainly of Greek army officers, volunteers brought from Crete, Peloponnese and other parts of Greek populated areas, as well as recruited local Macedonian Greeks such as the chieftain Vangelis Strebreniotis from the village of Srebreni (now Asprogeia), and Konstantinos Kottas, a former member of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) from the village of Rulya (later renamed Kottas by the Greek authorities in his honour). In 1905, Orthodox priest Kristo Negovani in his native village conducted the divine liturgy in the Albanian Tosk dialect and for his efforts was murdered on orders from Bishop Karavangelis who had condemned during mass the use of Albanian. \\"Negovani‚Äôs actions caused institutional responses that ultimately intensified the contradictions facing the church and its imperial patron. In the end, Papa Kristo Negovani was murdered for his acts of defiance of the explicit orders of Karavangjelis, the Metropolitan of Kastoria, who condemned the use of Tosk√´risht during mass.\\" Karavangelis succeeded to strengthen Greek aspirations in Macedonia and thus helped the later incorporation of the major part of Macedonia by Greece in the Balkan Wars, for which he is praised as a national hero of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia (\\"makedonomachos\\"). He is the author of the book of memoirs \\"The Macedonian Struggle\\" (). He was awarded Order of the White Eagle and Order of Saint Sava.

He is best known for his characters Oor Wullie and The Broons; comic strips featuring them have appeared in Scottish newspaper The Sunday Post since 1936, along with annual compilations. Watkins also illustrated for comics such as The Beano, The Dandy, The Beezer and Topper, and provided illustrations for Christian stories. Early life Watkins was born in Prestwich, Lancashire, England, although the family moved to Nottingham while he was still a baby. His father was a lithographic print artist who noted the boy's early artistic talent and ensured that he received extra art classes at the Nottingham School of Art. By the age of 10 the local newspaper declared him a \\"schoolboy genius.\\" He studied at Nottingham School of Art, and while working for Boots Pure Drug company in the early 1920s, Watkins' first published artwork appeared in Boots' staff magazine, The Beacon.Titled Our Gymnasium Class, it appeared in 1923. See Dudley D. Watkins (27/2/1907 ‚Äì 20/8/1969, UK) Work with D.C. Thomson In 1924 Watkins entered the Glasgow School of Art. In 1925 the school principal recommended Watkins to the thriving publisher D.C. Thomson, based in Dundee. Watkins was offered a six-months employment with D. C. Thomson, so he moved to their Dundee base and began providing illustrations for Thomson's \\"Big Five\\" story papers for boys (Adventure, Rover, Wizard, and later Skipper and Hotspur). The temporary employment turned into a full-time career; for several years he was just another illustrator, supplementing his small salary by teaching life drawing at Dundee Art School. In 1933 Watkins turned his hand to comic strip work, and soon his editor noticed that Watkins had a special talent as a cartoonist. In 1933 he drew The Rover Midget Comic and in 1934 he drew The Skipper Midget Comic. In 1935 Watkins' first regular comic strip, Percy Vere and His Trying Tricks appeared; the titular character was an inept magician whose tricks usually backfired on him. The strip ran for nearly two years, finally being replaced with another Watkins creation, Wandering Willie The Wily Explorer (Willie's hard-boiled characteristics would later re-appear in the form of Desperate Dan). While Percy was still appearing in Adventure, Watkins co- created, with writer/editor R. D. Low, what would become his most famous characters, Oor Wullie and The Broons. They were part of the first issue (8 March 1936) of a weekly eight-page pull-out 'Fun Section' of The Sunday Post. He was soon illustrating the Desperate Dan strip for The Dandy comic, launched in December 1937. His workload was further increased when D.C. Thomson created The Beano, an eight-page comic booklet, with Watkins being responsible for drawing the Lord Snooty strip.The first series of Lord Snooty ran until July 1949; after a 17-month break the second series began, with a mostly-reworked cast of characters. The Beano's first edition was dated 30 July 1938. When the Beezer and Topper were launched in the 1950s, Watkins was responsible for illustrating the Ginger strip (based largely on Oor Wullie, but unlike that strip the text was written in standard English and not in Scots vernacular) and the Mickey the Monkey strip for the two comics. Watkins' most enduring adventure strip was Jimmy and his Magic Patch, which debuted in the 1 January 1944 issue of The Beano and ran for 18 years. Watkins was one of only two D. C. Thomson cartoonists who signed their work (beginning in June 1946), which was known for its intricate detail and unique style. The other brilliant cartoonist to sign his work was Allan Morley and he was the first to do so. Private life He was a devout Christian and an enthusiastic supporter of the Church of Christ in Dundee (where he met his wife). He contributed artwork for mission calendars, and from 1956 he produced (free of charge) the comic strips William the Warrior and Tony & Tina ‚Äì The Twins for The Young Warrior, a children's paper published by the WEC Publications. These strips, filled with quotations from Scripture, were collected into a series of booklets. In March 2008 a watercolour by Watkins depicting The Crucifixion was discovered in a house in Lochgelly, Fife. Watkins and his wife built a substantial house in Broughty Ferry, which he named Winsterly.Dudley Dexter Watkins He continued working with D. C. Thomson for the rest of his life. On 20 August 1969 he was found dead at his drawing board, victim of a heart attack. It is a testament to Watkins' work that D. C. Thomson continued to reprint Oor Wullie and Broons strips in The Sunday Post for seven years before a replacement was found. Watkins' Desperate Dan strips were reprinted in The Dandy for fourteen years. In a 2006 BBC documentary marking 70 years of Oor Wullie, it was claimed that, due to his frequent mocking of Axis leaders in his comics before and during World War II, Watkins' name was on a list of enemies of the Third Reich.

It is a recombinant version of urate oxidase, an enzyme that metabolizes uric acid to allantoin. Urate oxidase is known to be present in many mammals but does not naturally occur in humans. Rasburicase is produced by a genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. The cDNA coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of Aspergillus flavus. Rasburicase is a tetrameric protein with identical subunits. Each subunit is made up of a single 301 amino acid polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of about 34 kDa. The drug product is a sterile, white to off-white, lyophilized powder intended for intravenous administration following reconstitution with a diluent. Elitek (rasburicase) is supplied in 3 mL and 10 mL colorless, glass vials containing rasburicase at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL after reconstitution. Medical uses Rasburicase is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (and European counterparts) for the prevention and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in people receiving chemotherapy for hematologic cancers such as leukemias and lymphomas. However, it is not clear if it results in important benefits such as decreased kidney problems or decreased risk of death as of 2017. Rasburicase is much more expensive than conventional therapy. It is being investigated for treating severely high blood levels of uric acid from other sources. For example, it has been used for hyperuricemia in gout, in other rheumatologic conditions, and in rhabdomyolysis with kidney failure. Side effects Rasburicase administration can cause anaphylaxis (incidence unknown); methemoglobinemia may occur in susceptible individuals such as those with G6PDH deficiency due to the production of hydrogen peroxide in the urate oxidase reaction. Testing patients for G6PDH deficiency prior to starting a course of rasburicase has been recommended. Pharmacology = Mechanism of Action = In humans, uric acid is the final step in the catabolic pathway of purines. Rasburicase catalyzes enzymatic oxidation of poorly soluble uric acid into an inactive and more soluble metabolite allantoin with carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide as byproducts in the chemical reaction. = Pharmacodynamics = The measurement of plasma uric acid was used to evaluate the effectiveness of rasburicase in clinical studies. Following administration of either 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg rasburicase daily for up to 5 days, plasma uric acid levels decreased within 4 hours and were maintained below 7.5 mg/dL in 98% of adult and 90% of pediatric patients for at least 7 days. There was no evidence of a dose response effect on uric acid control for doses between 0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg rasburicase. = Pharmacokinetics = The pharmacokinetics of rasburicase were evaluated in both pediatric and adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma or other hematological malignancies. Rasburicase exposure, as measured by AUC0-24 hr and Cmax, tended to increase with a dose range from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg. The mean terminal half-life was similar between pediatric and adult patients and ranged from 15.7 to 22.5 hours. The mean volume of distribution of rasburicase ranged from 110 to 127 mL/kg in pediatric patients and from 75.8 to 138 mL/kg in adult patients, respectively. Minimal accumulation of rasburicase ( < 1.3 fold) was observed between days 1 and 5 of dosing. In adults, age, gender, baseline liver enzymes and creatinine clearance did not impact the pharmacokinetics of rasburicase. A cross-study comparison revealed that after administration of rasburicase at 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg, the geometric mean values of body-weight normalized clearance were approximately 40% lower in Japanese (n=20) than that in Caucasians (n=22).

It was created by the Government Delegate on 9 January 1944. History Originally the political arm of the Polish Secret State was Political Consultative Committee (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy, PKP), a council composed of 4 main political parties. On 21 March 1943 it was renamed to Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP) and became an underground coalition parliament, composed of members of Polish Socialist Party, National Party, People's Party and Labor Party. It became the controlling body of both the Delegate's Office and the Headquarters of the Armia Krajowa. On 9 January 1944 it was turned into Council of National Unity, the underground parliament of Poland. Initially only the rump council was chosen, composed mostly of members of the former KRP. On 12 March of the same year the Council was extended to include more members. RJN was opposed to the communist-controlled quasi-parliament, State National Council. On 15 March 1944, the RJN declared its manifesto named O co walczy nar√≥d polski (What does the Polish nation fight for). According to the document, the main aims of Poland in the Second World War were: * restoration of free, independent, strong and safe Poland * reaching an international peace * cooperation of all nations * defeating Germany, its dismemberment and disarmament * forcing Germany to rebuild the countries it destroyed * organisation of a trial of war criminals * alliance with France, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States * restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union Regarding the post-war Poland, the RJN declared that its borders were to be based on the borders as of 1938, with East Prussia, Opole Silesia and part of Pomerania incorporated as war reparations. The Polish political system was to be based on parliamentary democracy, with strong self-government. The RJN also declared the will to develop the Polish industry and base the economy on socialist principles of planned economy and land reform. During the Warsaw Uprising the RJN issued several appeals and open letters to the western powers asking to help Warsaw and the Polish struggle for independence. On 22 February 1945, protested against the outcome of the Yalta Conference and the fact that no representatives of Poland were informed of the meeting. At the same time the RJN proposed to accept communist into the provisional government. After the Red Army conquered Poland, the members of the RJN remained underground. In March 1945 large part of them were arrested by the NKVD and brought to Moscow. After 3 months of interrogations, the members of the Polish government were sentenced in the Trial of the Sixteen. Until May 1945 the RJN was reconstructed from the remaining members. However, the Soviet occupation of Poland and the end of World War II made the further existence of RJN pointless. On 1 July 1945, the RJN issued the Do Narodu Polskiego i Narod√≥w Zjednoczonych (To the Polish Nation and the United Nations) manifesto and the so-called Testament of the Fighting Poland, in which it underlined the basic Polish aims of the war and the principles of Polish-Soviet relations. The latter document also demanded that the Red Army be withdrawn from Poland, the communists stopped reprisals and terror against the soldiers of the Polish Secret State and the civilians, democracy be introduced and the social reforms be started. After issuing the documents, the RJN was dissolved. Composition Since Poland was still under enemy occupation and no elections could be held, it was decided that the RJN would include representatives of all major political parties of Poland. Initially it included representatives of Socialist Party, People's Party, Labor Party and National Party and the Catholic clergy (three representatives each). In July 1944 the RJN was extended to include also representatives of Ch≈Çopska Organizacja Wolno≈õci, Ojczyzna, ZD and representatives of co-operative movement. The RJN was headed by the Main Commission. Its head was Kazimierz Pu≈ºak (nom de guerre Bazyli). After he was arrested and sentenced in a staged Trial of the Sixteen, the Main Commission was headed by various politicians, chosen from among the remainder of the council for a 1-month term.

Caracas: Fundaci√≥n Polar, 1997. It was drafted in mid-1999 by a constituent assembly that had been created by popular referendum. Adopted in December 1999, it replaced the 1961 Constitution, the longest-serving in Venezuelan history.Elkins, Zachary, Tom Ginsburg, and James Melton (2009). The Endurance of National Constitutions. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. It was primarily promoted by then President of Venezuela Hugo Ch√°vez and thereafter received strong backing from diverse sectors, including figures involved in promulgating the 1961 constitution such as Luis Miquilena and Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez. Ch√°vez and his followers (chavistas) refer to the 1999 document as the \\"Constituci√≥n Bolivariana\\" (the \\"Bolivarian Constitution\\") because they assert that it is ideologically descended from the thinking and political philosophy of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Bolivarianism. Since the creation of the Constituent National Assembly in August 2017, the Bolivarian government has declared the 1999 constitution suspended until a new constitution is created. The Constitution of 1999 was the first constitution approved by popular referendum in Venezuelan history, and summarily inaugurated the so-called \\"Fifth Republic of Venezuela\\" due to the socioeconomic changes foretold in its pages, as well as the official change in Venezuela's name from the Rep√∫blica de Venezuela (\\"Republic of Venezuela\\") to the Rep√∫blica Bolivariana de Venezuela (\\"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\"). Major changes are made to the structure of Venezuela's government and responsibilities, while a much greater number of human rights are enshrined in the document as guaranteed to all Venezuelansincluding free education up to tertiary level, free health care, access to a clean environment, right of minorities (especially indigenous peoples) to uphold their own traditional cultures, religions, and languages, among others. The 1999 Constitution, with 350 articles, is among the world's longest, most complicated, and most comprehensive constitutions. One of the outstanding differences between Venezuelan and most of the other constitutions of the Americas is the lack of the possibility of impeachment of the president by the national parliament. Instead, it enables citizens to remove the president through a recall referendum. Origins =Conceptualization= President Hugo Ch√°vez holds aloft a miniature copy of the 1999 Venezuelan constitution at the 2005 World Social Forum held in Porto Alegre, Brazil. President Hugo Ch√°vez was first elected under the provisions of the 1961 Constitution in the presidential election of 6 December 1998. Ch√°vez had been contemplating a constitutional convention for Venezuela as an ideal means to rapidly bring about sweeping and radical social change to Venezuela beginning from the eve of his 1992 coup attempt. After his imprisonment and release, he began to seek a political career with such a convention as its political goal. In the buildup to the 1998 presidential elections, one of Ch√°vez's promises was to organise a referendum asking the people if they wanted to convene a National Constituent Assembly. His very first decree as president was to order a referendum, which took place on 19 April. The electorate were asked two questionswhether a constituent assembly should be convened, and whether it should follow the mechanisms proposed by the president. 92% of voters approved calling a constituent assembly and 86% approved the electoral system suggested by Ch√°vez. =Election of the Constituent assembly= Elections were then held, on 25 July, to elect 131 deputies to the Constituent Assembly, which convened and debated proposals during the remainder of 1999. Members of Ch√°vez's MVR and allied parties formed the Polo Patriotico (\\"Patriotic Axis\\"). The alliance went on to win 121 of the 131 seats in the Constituent assembly. =The \\"judicial emergency committee\\"= Conflict soon arose between the Constituent assembly and the older institutions it was supposed to reform or replace. During his 1998 presidential campaign, and in advance of the 25 July elections to the Assembly, Ch√°vez had maintained that the new body would immediately have precedence over the existing Congress and the courts, including the power to dissolve them if it so chose.Russell Pelle, \\"Venezuela enters 2000 with progressive new constitution,\\" People's Weekly World. Against this, some of his opponents, including notably the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Cecilia Sosa Gomez, argued that the Constituent assembly must remain subordinate to the existing institutions until the constitution it produced had been ratified.Larry Rohter, \\"Voters Push Power Toward Venezuela Leader,\\" New York Times, 26 July 1999. In mid August 1999, the Constituent assembly moved to restructure the nation's judiciary, claiming the power to fire judges, seeking to expedite the investigations of corruption outstanding against what the New York Times estimated were nearly half of the nation's 4700 judges, clerks, and bailiffs.Larry Rohter, New York Times, 27 August 2009. On 23 August, the Supreme Court voted 8‚Äì6 that the Assembly was not acting unconstitutionally in assuming those powers; however, the next day Cecilia Sosa Gomez resigned in protest. Over 190 judges were eventually suspended on charges of corruption. On 25 August, the Constituent assembly declared a \\"legislative emergency,\\" voting to limit the Congress's work to matters such as supervising the budget and communications. In response, the Congress, which in July had decided to go into recess until October to avoid conflict with the Constituent assembly, declared its recess over, effective 27 August. At one point the Constituent assembly prohibited the Congress from holding meetings of any sort. However, on 10 September, the two bodies reached an agreement allowing for their \\"coexistence\\" until the new constitution took effect.El Pais (Spanish), 11 September 1999. Also, McGirk, Tim. (Time, 27 Dec 1999). \\"Hugo Ch√°vez Fr√≠as\\". Retrieved 3 Nov 2005. =Framing of the new constitution= Afterward, over the span of a mere 60 days in late 1999, the new and voter-approved Constituent assembly would frame and found a document that enshrined as constitutional law most of the structural changes Ch√°vez desired. Ch√°vez stated such changes were necessary in order to successfully and comprehensively enact his planned social justice programs. Sweeping changes in Venezuelan governmental structure were to be made; Ch√°vez's plan was, stemming from his 1998 campaign pledges, thus to dramatically open up Venezuelan political discourse to independent and third parties by radically altering the national political context. In the process, Ch√°vez sought to fatally paralyse his AD and COPEI opposition. All Ch√°vez's aims were, in one move, dramatically furthered. =Ratification by popular referendum= This new 1999 constitution was presented to the national electorate on 15 December 1999 and approved with a 72% \\"yes\\" vote (audited by the National Electoral Council). The new constitution then legally came into full effect the following 20 December. Text and guiding doctrines The text of the constitution is a hybrid of jurisprudential and political norms drawn from sources as wide as Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's writings on constitutionality and popular sovereignty, Jos√© Mart√≠, the Peruvian Marxist Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui, and Evgeny Pashukanis. While it retains a strong liberal-democratic base, it introduces elements of direct democracy such elements of popular sovereignty ( consultative or recall referendums), social responsibilities, right to rebel against the violation of the constitutional system (articles 333 and 350) and the independence of the republic from foreign domination. Besides these elements, separation of powers (albeit with two new branches of government) and rights of property, expression and strike were mainly kept the same as on the previous constitution. Innovations of the new constitution The Constituent assembly itself drafted the new 1999 Venezuelan constitution. With 350 articles, the document was, as drafted, one of the world's lengthiest constitutions. =Name of the state= Despite the initial reluctance of the constituent assembly's deputies, it changed the country's official name from the \\"Republic of Venezuela\\"‚Äù to the \\"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\". =Five branches of government= Significant changes were made to the separation of powers. Instead of the usual three branches of government, the new Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has five (Article 136):Textt of Article 136 # The executive branch (the Presidency). # The legislative branch (the National Assembly). # The judicial branch (the judiciary). # The electoral branch (poder electoral, or \\"electoral power\\"). # The citizens' branch (poder ciudadano, or \\"citizens' power\\"). The electoral branch is headed by the National Electoral Council (CNE) and is responsible for the independent oversight of all elections in the country, municipal, state, and federal. The citizens' branch is constituted by the (defensor del pueblo) (ombudsman or \\"defender of the people\\"), the Chief Public Prosecutor (fiscal general), and the comptroller general (contralor general). It is responsible for representing and defending the citizens in their dealings with powers of the Venezuelan state. The legislative branch was changed from a bicameral system to a unicameral system. =A strengthened and recallable presidency and the creation of a functioning executive vice-presidency = It also increased the presidential term of office from five to six years, subject to a limit of two terms. The document also introduced provisions for national presidential recall referendumsthat is, Venezuelan voters now were to be given the right to remove their President from office before the expiration of the presidential term. Such referendums were to be activated upon provision of petitions with a valid number of signatures. The new provision was activated for the first time when such a referendum was held in 2004, but it failed to receive majority support. See 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum. The Presidency was also strengthened, aside from being the Chief Executive, head of state and head of government, with the power to dissolve the National Assembly under certain conditions, and can issue decrees that has the force of law, upon authorization by the National Assembly. In 2009, term limits (not only that for President) were abolished by a referendum. And a post of Executive Vice- President was created to direct the day-to-day operations of the government and to exercise duties and powers that may delegated to him or her by the President as well as to act as the chief operating officer. He or she is being appointed by the President and can be removed via censure by the National Assembly. The Executive Vice-President is also politically responsible to the National Assembly side by side with the ministers. =Unicameral and weakened legislature= The new constitution also converted the formerly bicameral National Assembly into a unicameral legislature, and stripped it of many of its former powers. Thus, the new single-chamber National Assembly dropped the prior traditional arrangement of the bifurcation of legislative powers between a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. In addition, the legislative branch's powers were substantially reduced and transferred to the President of Venezuela. =The Public Defender= Provision was also made for a new position, the Public Defender (Defensor√≠a del Pueblo), which was to be an ombudsman office with the authority to check the activities of the presidency, the National Assembly, and the constitutionCh√°vez styled such a defender as the guardian of the so-called 'moral branch' of the Venezuelan government, tasked with defending public and moral interests. This is an idea derived from Bolivar's constitutionalism. =Public examination for judicial candidates= Lastly, the Venezuelan judiciary was reformed. Judges would, under the new constitution, be installed after passing public examinations and not, as in the old manner, be appointed by the National Assembly. Health care As Articles 83‚Äì85 under Title III of the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution enshrine free and quality healthcare as a human right guaranteed to all Venezuelan citizens, the Hugo Ch√°vez administration attempted to fulfill its constitutional obligations via the Barrio Adentro program. Notably, Article 84 under Title III mandate that the healthcare furnished through such public programmes as Barrio Adentro be publicly funded, and explicitly proscribes under any circumstance its privatization. The relevant text from the 1999 Bolivarian Constitution reads: > Article 83: Health is a fundamental social right and the responsibility of > the State, which shall guarantee it as part of the right to life. The State > shall promote and develop policies oriented toward improving the quality of > life, common welfare and access to services. All persons have the right to > protection of health, as well as the duty to participate actively in the > furtherance and protection of the same, and to comply with such health and > hygiene measures as may be established by law, and in accordance with > international conventions and treaties signed and ratified by the Republic. > Article 84: In order to guarantee the right to health, the State creates, > exercises guidance over and administers a national public health system that > crosses sector boundaries, and is decentralized and participatory in nature, > integrated with the social security system and governed by the principles of > gratuity, universality, completeness, fairness, social integration and > solidarity. The public health system gives priority to promoting health and > preventing disease, guaranteeing prompt treatment and quality > rehabilitation. Public health assets and services are the property of the > State and shall not be privatized. The organized community has the right and > duty to participate in the making- of decisions concerning policy planning, > implementation and control at public health institutions. > Article 85: Financing of the public health system is the responsibility of > the State, which shall integrate the revenue resources, mandatory Social > Security contributions and any other sources of financing provided for by > law. The State guarantees a health budget such as to make possible the > attainment of health policy objectives. In coordination with universities > and research centers, a national professional and technical training policy > and a national industry to produce health care supplies shall be promoted > and developed. The State shall regulate both public and private health care > institutions. =Changes to businesses= Article 308 of Title VI the Venezuelan constitution showed a changed view on businesses. This article sought to introduce support for alternative management of businesses. Mentioned in the article are cooperatives, family-owned businesses, small businesses and savings funds. The government supported these alternatives as a way to democratize capital and challenge oligopolistic control of the economy.Patrick Clark. Sowing the Oil?

After the transition of the political system to parliamentary democracy in 1990, the Republic changed its official name to Republic of Macedonia in 1991,On This Day ‚Äì Macedonian Information Agency ‚Äì MIA , see: 1991 and with the beginning of the breakup of Yugoslavia, it declared itself an independent country on 8 September 1991. Geographically SR Macedonia bordered Albania to the west, Greece to the south and Bulgaria to the east. Within Yugoslavia it bordered Serbia (including SAP Kosovo) to the north. Background The first Macedonian state was formally proclaimed under the name Democratic Federal MacedoniaConstitutional History of the Republic of Macedonia by Dr. Cvetan Cvetkovski, Faculty of Law, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia () at the First Plenary Session of the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the People's Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) during the World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia. It was set up clandestinely on 2 August 1944 in the Bulgarian occupation zone in Yugoslavia.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, ,p. 240.The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building And Legitimation, 1918‚Äì2005, Sabrina P. Ramet, Indiana University Press, 2006, , p. 139-140. This date is now celebrated by ethnic Macedonians as the day they were first allowed to freely state their nationality. It was chosen intentionally, as it was the date of the Ilinden Uprising against Ottoman rule in 1903. However, after the Bulgarian Army retreated from the region under Soviet pressure, on 8 September, right-wing IMRO nationalists declared a pro-German Macedonian puppet-state.Das makedonische Jahrhundert: von den Anf√§ngen der nationalrevolution√§ren Bewegung zum Abkommen von Ohrid 1893‚Äì2001, Stefan Troebst, Oldenbourg Verlag, 2007, , S. 234. In early October, under the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro-Soviet government, the Bulgarian Army reentered Yugoslavia to block the German forces in their withdrawal from Greece.Axis Forces in Yugoslavia 1941‚Äì45, Nigel Thomas, K. Mikulan, Darko Pavloviƒá, Osprey Publishing, 1995, , p. 33.World War II: The Mediterranean 1940‚Äì1945, World War II: Essential Histories, Paul Collier, Robert O'Neill, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, , p. 77. In Macedonia the Bulgarians fought side-by-side with the fighters of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia.War and revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941‚Äì1945: occupation and collaboration, Jozo Tomasevich, Stanford University Press, 2001, , p. 168. Vardar Macedonia was de facto liberated from the Germans and their collaborationists in late November 1944, so the ASNOM became operational in December, shortly after the German retreat. Nevertheless, in December anti- communist Albanian nationalists in Western Macedonia tried to remain in control of the region after the Yugoslav Partisans announced victory. They aimed to resist incorporation of the area into communist Yugoslavia and it was only in early 1945 that the Yugoslav Partisans were able to establish their control over the mountainous area. The nature of the new Yugoslav state remained unclear immediately after the war. Yugoslavia was envisioned by the Partisans as a \\"Democratic Federation\\", including six federal states.Ramet, Sabrina P.; The Three Yugoslavias: State-building and Legitimation, 1918‚Äì2005; Indiana University Press, 2006 When Tito's nomination as Prime Minister was accepted on 29 November 1945, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was declared, with its constitution coming into force in 1946. As a result, Macedonia changed its name to the People's Republic of Macedonia and was incorporated as a constituent republic in the Yugoslav Federation. However, some people were against the federation and demanded greater independence from the federal authorities, leading to their persecution. One of the notable victims of these purges was the first president, Metodija Andonov - ƒåento. To wipe out the remnants of Bulgarophile sentiments, the Yugoslavian communists started a severe processes of Macedonization and nation-building.Nikolaos Zahariadis, Essence of political manipulation: emotion, institutions, & Greek foreign policy, Peter Lang (publisher), 2005; , p. 85. People with various degrees of allegedly being pro-Bulgarian orientation (in the most cases they were pro-Independence and anti-Yugoslav) were purged from their positions, then isolated, arrested and imprisoned on fabricated charges. In many cases they were executed en masse, such as during the Bloody Christmas of 1945. The number of victims is estimated to be around 50 000, including those killed, imprisoned, deported, sent to forced labor, tortured, etc. More purges followed after the Tito-Stalin split. National language, national literature, national history and national church were not available in 1944, but they were created in a short time.One Macedonia With Three Faces: Domestic Debates and Nation Concepts, in Intermarium; Columbia University; Volume 4, No. 3 (2000‚Äì2001). The state was formed on the territory of Vardar Macedonia, a part of the wider geographical region of Macedonia, which was divided between several countries. Some Macedonian politicians from the Republic advocated the idea of a United Macedonia, which would include Aegean Macedonia and Pirin Macedonia. The idea was somewhat supported by the federal Yugoslav authorities on some occasions, or repressed, depending on the regional and international political situation. In 1963, the name of the state was changed to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Constitution :Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, 1974 ‚Äì Official Gazette The Socialist Republic of Macedonia, which was defined as a nation-state of the Macedonians and also a state of its ethnic minorities, had some powers normally associated with an independent state. The Constitution also recognized the right of self- determination and secession. The borders of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia could only be changed by decision of the republic's parliament. Its inhabitants held both Yugoslav citizenship and an internal Macedonian citizenship for state business. The Socialist Republic of Macedonia had its own constitution, presidency, government, parliament, official language, state symbols, Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Secretariat of Internal Affairs (Interior ministry), Bureau for Foreign Relations (Ministry of Foreign Affairs)Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia Official Site and other state prerogatives. Also, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia had its own Territorial Defence armed forces (Macedonian: –¢–µ—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–∞–ª–Ω–∞ –æ–¥–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∞, Teritorijalna odbrana).Ministry of Defence of Republic of Macedonia =System= The Socialist Republic of Macedonia was a one-party communist state, the ruling political party being the League of Communists of Macedonia (in Macedonian: –°–æ—ò—É–∑ –Ω–∞ –ö–æ–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞, Sojuz na Komunistite na Makedonija, abbreviation: –°–ö–ú, SKM). Being a constituent state of Yugoslavia, a leading founder of the Non-Aligned Movement, SR Macedonia pursued a neutral foreign policy and maintained a more liberal communist system compared to other communist states. The ruling ideology was based on Titoism and Workers' self-management (Macedonian: —Å–∞–º–æ—É–ø—Ä–∞–≤—É–≤–∞—ö–µ, samoupravuvanje). =Minorities= While the Macedonians were the majority and were one of the constituent nations of SFR Yugoslavia (official term: narod) the rights of the ethnic minorities (official term: narodnosti) were guaranteed by the Constitution.

The constitution of the SR Macedonia defined the state as the national state of the ethnic Macedonians, but also as the state of Albanians and Turks. From the start of Yugoslav rule in Macedonia, accusations surfaced that the new authorities were involved in retribution against people who did not support the formation of the new Macedonian national identity.Djokiƒá, Dejan (2003). Yugoslavism: Histories of a Failed Idea, 1918‚Äì1992, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers (pg. 122); . The number of victims due to organized killings of Bulgarians is unclear.

Tauris (publisher), 2004; , p. 40. In SR Macedonia the Bulgarophobia increased to the level of State ideology. Anastas Vangeli, Antiquity musing: reflections on the Greco-Macedonian symbolic contest over the narratives of the ancient past, MA thessis; Central European University, Budapest; 2009, p. 87. =Religion= Although the ruling communists discouraged religion, religious freedom was allowed to a certain extent. The authorities allowed the existence of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which proclaimed autocephaly in 1967. In 1972 the construction of the largest orthodox church St. Clement of Ohrid in the capital of Skopje began. Muslims, Catholics, Protestants and other religious communities also could maintain their own organisations and places of worship. =Geography= The Socialist Republic of Macedonia was the 4th largest constituent country of SFR Yugoslavia both by area and population. Within Yugoslavia, it had an internal border with the Socialist Republic of Serbia to the north and its subunit the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo to the north-west and international borders with Greece to the south, the People's Republic of Bulgaria to the east and the People's Socialist Republic of Albania to the west. Transition In 1990 the form of government peacefully changed from socialist state to parliamentary democracy. The first pluralist elections were held on 11 November the same year. The once ruling communist party took a reformist direction and renamed itself League of Communists of Macedonia ‚Äì Party for Democratic Change led by Petar Go≈°ev. After the head of the last communist presidency Vladimir MitkovFaculty of Law, University of Skopje resigned, Kiro Gligorov became the first democratically elected president of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia on 31 January 1991. On 16 April parliament adopted a constitutional amendment removing \\"Socialist\\" from the official name of the entity, and on 7 June the new name Republic of Macedonia was officially established. After the process of dissolution of Yugoslavia began, the Republic of Macedonia issued a Sovereignty Declaration on 25 January 1991Sovereignty Declaration ‚Äì Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia and later proclaimed itself a fully independent country, following a referendum held on 8 September 1991.

It was created by Nick Giannopoulos, George Kapiniaris and Simon Palomares, who also starred in the series. They were already quite well known for their comedy stage show, Wogs out of Work. The title is a nameplay on the film Apocalypse Now. Each episode was 20 minutes in length and filmed in front of a live audience. Program synopsis Jim's (Giannopoulos) father asks him to run the family business, the Acropolis caf√©, when he suddenly leaves Australia to return to his homeland Greece. The series centres on the activities of the cafe staff. Greek Jim Stefanidis, is the immature owner and his best friend, Spaniard Ricky Martinez (Palomares) is the sensible manager (seasons 1-2 only). Memo (Kapiniaris) is the traditional Greek waiter, Liz is the liberated Australian waitress. Skip is the na√Øve new cook from the bush and Manolis is the stubborn cook from the old cafe. The show's humour arises from the clash of cultures and beliefs. Jim's hairdresser cousin Effie, played by Mary Coustas, became a hugely popular and enduring character during the run of the show. Coustas later reprised the role for several TV specials and series including Effie, Just Quietly, an SBS comedy/interview show, and Greeks on the Roof, a short-lived Greek-Australian version of the British talk show The Kumars at No. 42. Popular culture Acropolis Now helped popularise the term \\"skippy\\" or \\"skip\\" to refer to Anglo-Celtic Australians and others of European but non-Mediterranean descent. This term (inspired by the iconic 60's TV series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo) became popular with Mediterranean- Australians, and to a lesser extent non-Mediterranean people, especially in Melbourne. Production The program was produced by Crawford Productions which is now owned by WIN Television.

He was succeeded by Tikka Khan who was promoted as four-star rank and designated as the Chief of Army Staff. Biography =Early life and military career= Gul Hassan Khan was born in Quetta, Balochistan, British India into a middle class Pashtun family in 1921. In 1939, he was admitted and joined the Royal Indian Military College in Dehradun and moved to the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun to graduate from there in 1942. He was an excellent Hockey player and gained fame as boxer at the Military Academy. He was commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in Frontier Force Regiment (FF Regiment) and posted in Army GHQ in New Delhi. He was later stationed in Assam with Assam Rifles and participated in Burma Campaign in 1944‚Äì45 on the side of the Great Britain. During World War II, he selected to serve as Aide-de-Camp (ADC) to Viscount Slim who commanded the 14th Army. He was promoted to two-star rank and elevated as Major-General in the army. During the war with India in 1965, he was Director- General of Military Operations (DGMO) and directed military operations against the Indian Army. His actions of valor won him the nomination of prestigious Sitara-e-Pakistan by the President. In 1967, he was made GOC of the 1st Armoured Division of the Armoured Corps stationed in Multan, Punjab. In 1969, he was promoted to three-star rank as lieutenant-general and subsequently was the Chief of General Staff (CGS) at the Army GHQ. =Role in 1971 Black September= According to the testimonies provided by Major-General A.O. Mitha, it was Gul Hasan's lobbying at the Army GHQ who also saved then Brigadier Zia-ul-Haq (Chief of Pakistan military mission) from being terminated. Brigadier Zia who was in Jordan in 1971 was recommended to be court-martialled by Major-General Nawazish in his submission to President Yahya Khan for disobeying GHQ orders by commanding a Jordanian armoured division against the Palestinians, as part of actions in which thousands were killed. That event is known as \\"Operation Black September\\". It was Gul Hasan who interceded for Zia and Yahya Khan let Zia off the hook. =1971 war and Bangladesh= In 1971, he was the Chief of General Staff at the Army GHQ and allegedly either executed or approved military operations in East Pakistan. As CGS of Pakistan Army, he was heading the military operations and intelligence during this period. It is also alleged that he was the \\"intellectual planner\\" of Pakistan Army's crackdown in the East and that he preferred a military solution of the political crisis looming over the horizon of Pakistan during 1971. He lacked foresight as was viewed by some of his colleagues in Pakistan Army as \\"short on strategic vision but good as field commander\\". He, along with Air Marshal A.R. Khan, played a crucial role in forcing President Yahya Khan to step down from the presidency. Army Commander (1971‚Äì72) After the 1971 war which ended with unilateral surrender to India, President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto called Lieutenant-General Gul Hassan to take over the post of Commander in Chief of Pakistan Army, which he refused. However, he reluctantly accepted the post on several of his set conditions and took over the command of Pakistan Army. In controversy, Khan was avoided to be promoted the four- star rank as opposed to his predecessors, by Bhutto. Initially, he provided his support to President Bhutto but began obstructing the hearings of Hamoodur Rahman Commission. Reports were surfacing that Gul Hassan Khan, alongside with Air Marshal A.R. Khan, were interfering in state's affairs and influencing on Hamoodur Rahman Commission. As Army Commander-in-Chief, he lessened the role and value of the Inter‚ÄìServices Intelligence which lost its importance throughout this time, and the new Army Commander did not pay any attention to ISI as he relied on Intelligence Bureau (IB) instead. The ISI's covert operations were never revealed to him and Khan was reluctant and incompetent commander to control the ISI; instead the ISI began directly reporting to President Bhutto. In 1972, the Hamoodur Rahman Commission implicated him for his role in atrocities committed in East Pakistan which eventually led towards his termination. Upon approval of his termination papers, the Governor of Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar allegedly huddled up in a car and taken to Lahore. Khan's alleged involvement and his controversial approvals of military operations during 1971 in East Pakistan created a public resentment towards him, as he was the Director-General of the Director-general for the Military Operations (DGMO). When it was cleared by Hamoodur Rahman Commission, led by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, Bhutto fired Khan as Army Commander-in-Chief and appointed General Tikka Khan instead. Diplomatic career After his stint as the commander-in-chief of Pakistan Army, Khan was appointed as Pakistan's ambassador to Austria. He also served as ambassador to Greece from April 1975 to April 1977. He resigned from the latter position in protest against alleged rigging during the 1977 Pakistani general election. Family He had three brothers and a sister. He has relatives still residing in Pabbi Nowshera District, and in Quetta, Pakistan. General Gul Hassan Khan died in 1999 and was buried in Pabbi in Nowshera District (Main town of Chirrat Cant, Chowki Mumriaz, Taroo Jaba, Akber Pura). In the last few years of his life he was dividing his time between Vienna, Austria and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. He has one son, Sher Hassan Khan, who resides in Vienna with his mother.

Gen. Asif immediately released the press release through the ISPR where he committed towards preventing the military interference in the national politics when he noted that \\"army's image had been tarnished and its officers corrupted in Pakistan's 25 years of martial law.\\" Gen. Asif, who had pro-western views, worked together with Chairman joint chiefs Gen. Shamim and his JS HQ to improve bilateral relations between Pakistan and the United States when he agreed to deploy the combat brigades of the Pakistan Army in Somalia as part of the UN Mission to end the civil war in the country. His political views reflected the libertarianism and tried to improve the military-to-military relations with the Indian Army when he successfully took Pakistan out of what he saw as the dead-end legacy of policy of Islamism by former conservative President Zia. During Nawaz's tenure, the army took on the surprising role of becoming a protector of a free press and liberal values of criticism. As an army chief, Gen. Asif played a crucial role in providing the military aid to the civilian Government of Pakistan when he deployed the Pakistan Army Rangers to aid the Sindh Police against the dacoits and gangs in Karachi and rural Sindh. Death and legacy Asif Nawaz died on 8 January 1993, while he was jogging near his home in Rawalpindi. The death was ruled a heart attack, but his family commissioned a private test on hair from his brush, which was conducted in the United States. The test registered high levels of arsenic. As a result, his body was exhumed, and an autopsy was conducted by French, British, and American doctors. No poison was found in his body, and the cause of death was determined to be a heart attack. Nawaz was succeeded by General Abdul Waheed Kakar as the next Army Chief. Legacy Benazir Bhutto, former Prime Minister, then described Nawaz as \\"a true professional soldier,\\" and further stated that \\"he did what he said he would do ‚Äì he kept the army out of politics.\\" Unlike many of his predecessors, Nawaz was incorruptible and often talked of how he would relax when he retired, unlike other generals who plunged into politics.

After graduating from local high school in 1955, Kakar went to attend the Edwardes College where he secured his graduation. He joined the Pakistan Army in 1956, and was directed to attend the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul where he was expected to pass out from the academy in 1958 but was held back for a 6-month term. Eventually, Waheed gained commission in the Frontier Force Regiment in 1959 as a 2nd-Lt. His combat duty witnessed the military actions in Chawinda in Sialkot Punjab in Pakistan against the Indian Army during the conflict with India in 1965. In 1971, Major Kakar served as the brigade major of an independent infantry stationed at the Sulemanki sector, and fought against the Indian Army. His combat duty during the actions of both wars served his reputation as did scenes of major battles in the respective wars. After the war, Major Kakar was selected to attend the Command and Staff College in Canada, where he stood first in the examinations and qualified as a psc. He was later selected to attend a staff course program. Upon returning from Canada, he continued his education when he was selected to attend the National Defence University (NDU) where he studied and attained graduation in War studies degree at the Armed Forces War College (afwc) of the National Defence University. In 1976‚Äì78, Brig. Kakar was appointed as Chief of Staff of the II Corps, stationed in Multan, commanded by then-Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan. In 1984, Major-General Kakar was subsequently given the command of the 16th Infantry Division in Quetta as its GOC. In 1987‚Äì89, Maj-Gen. Kakar was appointed as an Adjutant-General at the Army GHQ. At the time he was ordered to admit three students in the Army Medical College but he refused despite direct orders from the President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, as they did not meet the minimum criteria. The President then ordered the increase of overall seats from 60 to 100. In 1989, Lieutenant-General Kakar was posted as field commander of the XII Corps, stationed in Quetta.  Chief of Army Staff  In summer of 1993, the MoD announced the names of retiring army generals who were due retirement, and such list included Lt-Gen. Kakar as he was also seeking the retirement. Without consulting the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan nominated and approved the appointment papers of junior-most Lt-Gen. Kakar to the promotion of senior four-star rank when elevating him as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). The appointment was extremely controversial due to Lt-Gen. Kakar superseding at least five senior army generals, including: *The list including the superseding five senior army generals by seniority: **Lieutenant-General Farrakh Khan, Chief of General Staff (CGS) at Army GHQ in Rawalpindi. **Lieutenant-General Javed Nasir, Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI). **Lieutenant-General Mohammad Ashraf, Field Commander, IV Corps in Lahore. **Lieutenant-General Arif Bangash, Quartermaster General (QMG) at Army GHQ in Rawalpindi. **Lieutenant- General Rehem Dil Bhatti, President of National Defence University (NDU). Among these listed army generals, the CGS, the QMG, and the DG ISI, opted to stay to serve on their assignments despite being overlooked for the promotions. After his appointment, a member of the National Assembly who belonged to PMPA was quoted: \\"the era of the Pakhtoons has begun. The president belonged to the Frontier province and so did the new Chief of Army Staff.\\" After assuming the command of the army as its army chief and contrary to the expectations of President Ghulam Ishaq, General Kakar played a decisive role in resolving the constitutional crises by securing first the resignation of President Ghulam Ishaq and later Prime Minister Sharif in 1993. This allowed the holding of the nationwide general elections that witnessed the return of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto, who eventually became the Prime Minister of Pakistan. During his tenure, General Kakar was instrumental in securing the government funding for the Shaheen project developed under the PAEC's scientists. In September 1995, General Abdul Waheed Kakar played a crucial role in sustaining the democracy by having discovered a plot by a group of army officers headed by Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, acting in complicity with the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami a militant group, to assassinate him and Benazir Bhutto, to capture power. This plan was foiled by the Military Intelligence and the Military Police who initiated the operation to have those involved captured and arrested. In 1996, General Kakar reportedly declined the extension of his service and there was no public statement on the matter. After his retirement, he never appeared in public and lives a very quiet life in Rawalpindi.  Reception  General Kakar had an imposing and robust personality that brokered no nonsense. In the military, he was popular among his colleagues as a flamboyant rider and a mountaineer. His reception as an army chief was hailed and celebrated by the Pashtuns nationalists when Mahmood Achakzai, then-MNA, reportedly remarked in the news media in 1993: \\"This is not a General from the Sandhurst colonial brand. I welcome an enlightened man from the rigid mountain ranges of Loralai. He has the professional skills for improving the war performance of the Pakistan Army. But more than that, he is intelligent enough to comprehend politics and will promote the democratic process. General Waheed is not a religious extremist.\\" See also *Civilian control of the military  References   External links  * Official profile at Pakistan Army website 1937 births Pashtun people Baloch politicians People from Peshawar Edwardes College alumni Frontier Force Regiment officers Pakistani military personnel of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 Pakistani expatriates in Canada National Defence University, Pakistan alumni Pakistani generals Pakistani democracy activists Chiefs of Army Staff, Pakistan Living people ","title":"Abdul Waheed Kakar"},{"id":"1211725","text":"The name Deathwing may refer to: In comics and literature * Deathwing (comics), an alternate-future incarnation of Dick Grayson/Nightwing, from the DC Universe. * The Deathwing, part of an evil organisation in Douglas Hill's Last Legionary series of young-adult science fiction novels.

The Primera Divisi√≥n turned professional in 1931 when 18 clubs broke away from the amateur leagues to form a professional one. Since then, the season has been contested annually in four different formats and calendars. The Argentine championship was ranked in the top 10 as one of the strongest leagues in the world (for 1 January 2015 ‚Äì 31 December 2015 period) by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS).

Published by Autores Editores (1992) ‚Äì The AAFL was the first football league outside of the British Isles.,\\"Salvation Army\\", The Guardian, 4 June 2006 to establish a football league. The first Primera Divisi√≥n matches were played on 12 April 1891: Buenos Aires FC vs. St. Andrew's and Old Caledonians vs. Belgrano FC. A single double round-robin tournament was played each year, and the team with the most points was crowned as champion, except for 1936, during that year the winners of Copa de Honor and the Campeonato played a match for the championship title. The single tournament arrangement lasted until 1966. During this period, the traditional \\"Big Five\\" clubs, namely, Boca Juniors, River Plate, Independiente, Racing and San Lorenzo dominated Argentine football. No other team besides them had won the league championship in these 36 years.\\"Final Tables Argentina 1931‚Äì1940 (Professional)\\" at RSSSF\\"Final Tables Argentina 1941‚Äì1950\\" at RSSSF\\"Final Tables Argentina 1951‚Äì1960\\" at RSSSF\\"Final Tables Argentina 1961‚Äì1970\\" at RSSSF The most serious title challenge came from Banfield in 1951, when they gained the same points with Racing Club in the league table. However, they lost 1‚Äì0 in the two-legged first place playoffs and gave the title to Racing. The averaging system for relegations was implemented for the first time in the 1957 championship, with Ferro Carril Oeste becoming the first team to be relegated under that system.Argentina 1957 by Osvaldo J. Gorgazzi at RSSSF.com Averaging continued until 1963, when the championship returned to its old format (with the worst placed teams being relegated).La historia de los promedios en el f√∫tbol argentino: c√≥mo y cu√°ndo se inventaron, Goal.com, 13 Jul 2017 Nevertheless, there were no relegations until 1967 (with Uni√≥n (SF) and Deportivo Espa√±ol being sent to Primera B after playing a relegation tournament contested by teams of First and Second divisions to define the promotions and relegations).Argentina 1967 at RSSSF.com =Metropolitano and Nacional (1967‚Äì1985)= In 1967, the single tournament format was abandoned and replaced by two championships in each year: the Metropolitano and the Nacional. The Metropolitano only allowed clubs competing the old tournament to participate, while the Nacional was open to teams from regional tournaments. The format of competition was also altered, with the double round-robin tournament replaced by the two-group championship Metropolitano and single round-robin Nacional in that year. This change brought about a revolution in Argentine football, as small teams, like Estudiantes de La Plata at first, and V√©lez Sarsfield, Chacarita Juniors and others in later years, broke down the hegemony of the five clubs who had won all the championships up to that date. Between 1967 and 1969, the Metropolitano and Nacional had gone through several format changes. In the first three years, the Metropolitano was a two-group championship, with the best two teams from each group competing the semi- finals of the knock-out stage. The six best teams of each group would advance to the Nacional, with four more teams coming from regional tournaments, to compete for the Nacional championship in a single round-robin format. The seventh and eighth team of each group, alongside four teams from regional tournaments, played the Promocional tournament, which, in 1969, was replaced by the Petit tournament contested without regional teams. The ninth to twelfth teams of each group entered the Reclasificatorio tournament to determine the relegating teams. In 1970, the format of the Metropolitano and Nacional underwent a reform. Since that year, and until 1985, the Nacional had become a group tournament with playoffs, while the Metropolitano had been competed under a single or double round-robin system, except for the 1974, 1976 and 1979 edition, which were also contested as a group tournament with playoffs.\\"Final Tables Argentina 1971‚Äì1980\\" at RSSSF Despite the format change in 1970, teams still entered the Nacional championship, Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament according to their rankings in the Metropolitano in that year. However, in 1971, the tournaments were separated. Teams did not enter the Nacional by finishing at the top ranks of Metropolitano. On the other hand, the Petit tournament and Reclasificatorio tournament were abandoned. The Metropolitano and Nacional became two truly individual tournaments. Although the old system was reused in 1972, the separation was instituted again in 1973 and was adopted throughout the remaining Metropolitano and Nacional era. The Metropolitano was always played first, until the order of the tournaments was reversed in 1982.\\"Final Tables Argentina 1981‚Äì1990\\" at RSSSF After 20 years since the last time it had been used, the average system for relegations returned in the 1983 Metropolitano championship, two years after San Lorenzo was relegated. That year, River Plate finished 18¬∞ out of 19 teams and would have been relegated under the old system, along with Racing de C√≥rdoba. The first teams to be relegated on average were Racing and Nueva Chicago. Boca Juniors was also struggling at that time and had a dismal 1984 season. These facts have led to speculation that the averaging system was instituted to minimize the chance of big teams being relegated.La verdadera historia de la creaci√≥n de los promedios on Infobae, 31 May 2007 =European-styled seasons (1985‚Äì1991)= Following the advice of Argentina national football team's then coach Carlos Salvador Bilardo, the structure of play was modified in 1985. Traditionally, like other countries in Southern Hemisphere, football season began and ended according to the calendar year. However, upon the reform, European style season was adopted for the first time among all the South American countries. Moreover, instead of holding two championships every year, only one double round-robin tournament was contested, like football leagues in Europe. The team topping the table at the end of season was crowned the champion. In 1985, after the Nacional was played, the Metropolitano was not held, while the new single tournament (1985/86) was played for the first time. In 1988‚Äì89 season, three points were given to match winners. If a draw occurred, penalty shootout was taken place and the winner of the shootout would get two points while the loser still had one. This format was waived in the following season. =Apertura and Clausura (1991‚Äì2012)= Five years later, the single championship was split into two single-round tournaments, giving birth to the Apertura and Clausura arrangement.El fin del Apertura y el fin del Clausura by Alejandro Rebossion on El Pa√≠s, 9 May 2012 In 1991 the two champions played winner-take-all matches. This practice was very controversial, especially since one of the biggest teams Boca Juniors lost the finals against Newell's Old Boys, costing them their first official championship since 1981 despite an unbeaten run in the Clausura. In 1992 the game was held as well (this time between Newell's Old Boys and River Plate), but regardless of the result (which favored River Plate) both teams were awarded the title of Champion. After 1992, the practice was quickly abandoned, so that two champions (on equal footing) were crowned every season and no deciding game is played. Originally, two points were given to match winners except the 1989‚Äì90 season. In 1995‚Äì96, the rule was changed and three points were given for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss since then. The 1999‚Äì2000 season introduced the promotion and relegation system for the first time, where the two clubs placed 1st and 2nd within the four teams with the lowest average, had to play a two- leg series with teams from Primera B Nacional to keep their place in the division.La Promoci√≥n, una definici√≥n dram√°tica que se despide del f√∫tbol argentino, Infobae, 1 Jul 2012 =Inicial and Final (2012‚Äì2014)= For the 2012‚Äì13 season, the Torneo Apertura and Clausura became \\"Torneo Inicial\\" and \\"Torneo Final,\\" being disputed with the same format as before but proclaiming only one champion each season, unlike the last format that had two champions (Apertura and Clausura, respectively).\\"AFA: Se aprobaron los cambios en los torneos de f√∫tbol\\", Radio Continental web, 9 May 2012 Before those changes, a controversial project for the 2012‚Äì13 season had been proposed: it consisted in a new tournament that would contain both the Primera Divisi√≥n and Primera B Nacional teams: the former was not going to have any relegated team in its 2011‚Äì12 season and include sixteen teams from the latter, Primera B Nacional. The tournament would also include a team from the Primera B Metropolitana and one from the Torneo Argentino A, creating a 38-team league. These changes were strongly opposed by the media and the people, and finally the tournament was called off. However, the project for the new format was successfully picked up starting from the 2015 season. = Superfinal (2013‚Äì2014) = Once Inicial and Final tournaments have finished, both winners had to play a match for the Copa Campeonato (familiarly known as Superfinal). The AFA had previously determined that the first edition (played in 2013) would be considered as a Primera Divisi√≥n official title (2012‚Äì13 season), therefore V√©lez Sarsfield awarded its 10th official championship after defeating Newell's.\\"V√©lez venci√≥ a Newell's y es el Supercampe√≥n\\", Clar√≠n, 29 Dec 2013 Nevertheless, from the 2014 edition it was determined that the Superfinal would not be considered as a Primera Divisi√≥n title but an official cup.\\"La AFA homolog√≥ la final de River como una copa nacional\\", Cancha Llena, 28 May 2014 Due to this the 2015 and 2016 seasons were played as single tournaments with only one champion per season, the Copa Campeonato has not been held since then. = 2014‚Äì20: One tournament again and Superliga= Starting August 2014, the \\"Torneo de Transici√≥n\\" was held, with 20 teams participating (17 from the 2013‚Äì14 season and 3 promoted from the 2013‚Äì14 Primera B Nacional). No teams were relegated at the end of the championship.Se sorte√≥ el Fixture del Torneo de Transici√≥n, que arrancar√° en agosto y el 'S√∫per' en la 10¬™ In 2015, the format switched to a tournament with 30 teams. The first five clubs of the Zonas A & B of 2014 Primera B Nacional season promoted to the Primera Divisi√≥n. Those 10 teams, with the addition of the 20 clubs currently participating in the top division, qualified to contest the next season.\\"Confirmado: El pr√≥ximo torneo ser√° con 30 equipos\\" on Perfil.com, 11 Nov 2014 That same year, the AFA announced the format for the next five seasons of the Primera Divisi√≥n: * In the first half of 2016, the league was contested by 30 teams. One team was relegated to and one team was promoted from Primera B Nacional. * From August 2016 to June 2017, the league was also contested by 30 teams. Four teams were relegated to and two teams were promoted from Primera B Nacional. * From August 2017 to June 2018, the league was contested by 28 teams. Four teams will be relegated to and two teams will be promoted from Primera B Nacional. This season was also the first \\"Superliga Argentina\\", organised by the homonymous entity, that is administrated independently and has its own statute. Therefore, the AFA focused exclusively in the Argentina national teams. The 2017‚Äì18 season was the first championship organised by the body. * From August 2018 to June 2019, the Superliga was contested by 26 teams. Four teams were relegated to and two teams were promoted from Primera B Nacional. = 2020‚Äìpresent = In February 2020, President of AFA Claudio Tapia stated that the Superliga had been established to position Argentine football as a product, but it failed in that purpose. As a result, AFA would take over the organisation of Primera Divisi√≥n championships, according with Tapia's statement. One month after those announcements, the president of the Superliga, Mariano Elizondo, resigned.Renunci√≥ Mariano Elizondo, Infobae, 10 March 2020 The Superliga was replaced by a similar body, named \\"Liga Profesional de F√∫tbol\\", directly linked to AFA and presided by Marcelo Tinelli.Qui√©n es qui√©n en la AFA, Clar√≠n, 19 May 2020 It was expected that Superliga was dissolved once the 2020 edition of Copa de la Superliga Argentina finished, but due to COVID-19 pandemic the cup was cancelled, accelerating times. In May 2020, the LFP was launched by the AFA.  Champions  Since the first championship held in 1891, 27 different clubs have won the Primera Divisi√≥n title at least once. The most successful club is River Plate, with 36 titles.\\"Torneo Argentino de Primera Divisi√≥n ‚Äì T√≠tulos por Equipo\\", SobreFutbol.com Other successful clubs are Boca Juniors with 34, Racing with 18, Independiente with 16, and San Lorenzo with 15.  Top scorers  The all-time top scorer of Primera Divisi√≥n Argentina is Paraguayan forward Arsenio Erico with 295 goals. Most players on the all-time top scorers table had their golden age before the 1970s, with all of the top five all-time scorers having retired before 1973. The only player retired after that year in the top twenty list is Mart√≠n Palermo, who played for Estudiantes (LP) and Boca Juniors in Primera Divisi√≥n.  Records and facts   Media coverage  In Argentina, matches are broadcast by American companies Fox Sports and Turner, which signed a contract for 5 years where both companies agreed to pay A$ 3,200 million per year. Local company Torneos, who was formerly the official broadcaster of the Argentine championship from 1985 until 2009, will take over the content production of the games for Fox and La Corte will handle content production for Turner while Cablevisi√≥n, DirecTV and Telecentro will be the TV operators. Until the agreement with Fox and Turner was signed, Argentine football matches were broadcast nationally by El Trece, Telefe, America TV, and Channel 7. Games were free in Argentina from 2009 to 2016, when the National Government and AFA decided rescind the agreement. The Government paid A$9,500 million for 7 years. The league attracts television audiences beyond South America and Spain. The matches are broadcast in over 80 countries; ESPN (one match per week), Fox Sports (two matches per week) and TyC Sports (eleven matches per week) broadcast live Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n matches in Latin America. In the United States, the matches are broadcast on TyC Sports (six matches per week). BeIN Sports broadcasts the games live in France, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and MENA regions. ITV showed highlights on a regional basis with the introduction of overnight broadcasting in 1988‚Äì89. Channel 5 showed highlights from 1999‚Äì2003, while Premier Sports showed live games across 2011 and 2012.

They are a part of the rose family (Rosaceae) and related to the apple. The botanical genus name derives from the Greek word photeinos for shiny and refers to the often glossy leaves. Most species are evergreen, but deciduous species also occur. The small apple-shaped fruit has a size of 4 to 12 mm and forms in large quantities. They ripen in the fall and often remain hanging on the bush until well into the winter. The fruits are used as food by birds, which excrete the seeds with their droppings and thereby distribute the plant. The natural range of these species is restricted to warm temperate Asia, from the Himalaya east to Japan and south to India and Thailand. They have, however, been widely cultivated throughout the world as ornamentals for their white flowers and red fruits. The scientific name Photinia is also widely used as the common name. Another name sometimes used is \\"Christmas berry\\", but this name is a source of confusion, since it is commonly applied to plants in several genera including Heteromeles, Lycium, Schinus, and Ruscus. The name \\"photinia\\" also continues to be used for several species of small trees in the mountains of Mexico and Central America which had formerly been included in the genus Photinia. Description Photinia √ó fraseri, showing the red colour of new growth contrasted to the glossy green older leaves Photinias typically grow from 4‚Äì15 m tall, with a usually irregular crown of angular branches; the branches are often (not always) thorny. The leaves are alternate, entire or finely toothed, varying between species from 3‚Äì15 cm in length and 1.5‚Äì5 cm wide; the majority of species are evergreen but several are deciduous. The flowers are produced in early summer in dense terminal corymbs; each flower is 5‚Äì10 mm diameter, with five rounded white petals; they have a mild, hawthorn-like scent. The fruit is a small pome, 4‚Äì12 mm across, bright red and berry-like, produced large quantities, maturing in the fall and often persisting well into the winter. The fruit are consumed by birds, including thrushes, waxwings and starlings; the seeds are dispersed in their droppings. Photinia species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including common emerald, feathered thorn and setaceous Hebrew character. Taxonomy Some botanists also include the closely related North American species Heteromeles arbutifolia in Photinia ‚Äî as Photinia arbutifolia. The genus Stranvaesia is so similar in morphology to Photinia that its species have sometimes been included within it, but recent molecular data indicate that the two genera are not related. The genus Aronia has been included in Photinia in some classifications, but recent molecular data confirm that these genera are not closely related. Other close relatives include the firethorns (Pyracantha), cotoneasters (Cotoneaster) and hawthorns (Crataegus). A number of species have been moved to the separate genus Stranvaesia including P. amphidoxa, P. davidiana, P. nussia, and P. tomentosa. Uses Flower of an ornamental shrub cultivar Photinias are very popular ornamental shrubs, grown for their fruit and foliage. Numerous hybrids and cultivars are available; several of the cultivars are selected for their strikingly bright red young leaves in spring and summer. The most widely planted are: *Photinia √ó fraseri (P. glabra √ó P. serratifolia) - red tip photinia, Christmas berry :*Photinia √ó fraseri 'Red Robin' - probably the most widely planted of all, this cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit :*Photinia √ó fraseri 'Little Red Robin', a plant similar to 'Red Robin', but dwarf in stature with an ultimate height/spread of around 2‚Äì3 ft :*Photinia √ó fraseri 'Camilvy' :*Photinia √ó fraseri 'Curly Fantasy' :*Photinia √ó fraseri 'Super Hedger' - a newer hybrid with strong upright growth :*Photinia √ó fraseri 'Pink Marble' also known as 'Cassini', a new cultivar with rose-pink tinted new growth and a creamy-white variegated margin on the leaves :*Photinia √ó fraseri 'Robusta' *Photinia 'Redstart' (Stranvaesia davidiana √ó P. √ó fraseri) *Photinia 'Palette' (parentage unknown) *Photinia davidiana 'Fructu Luteo' (fruit yellow) *Photinia davidiana 'Prostrata' (a low-growing form) Toxicity Some varieties of Photinia are toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in the vacuoles of foliage and fruit cells. When the leaves are chewed these compounds are released and are rapidly converted to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) which blocks cellular respiration. The amount of HCN produced varies considerably between taxa, and is in general greatest in young leaves. Ruminants are particularly affected by cyanogenic glycosides because the first stage of their digestive system (the rumen) provides better conditions for liberating HCN than the stomachs of monogastric vertebrates.

It borders the Centre and East regions to the south, the Northwest and West regions to the southwest, Nigeria to the west, the Central African Republic (CAR) to the east, and the North Region to the north. This mountainous area forms the barrier between Cameroon's forested south and savanna north. At almost 64,000 km¬≤ in land area, the Adamawa is the third largest of Cameroon's ten regions. The land is rugged and sparsely populated, however, as most is devoted to the rearing of cattle. The Muslim Fulbe (Fulani) form the major ethnic group, though Tikar, Gbaya, and other peoples are present in lesser numbers. History =Early population movements= The Adamawa's oldest populations were various Paleo-Sudanese peoples. These were mostly displaced or absorbed by invading Sudanese groups in the 8th or 9th century. These included the Mbum (Mboum), Ndoro (Dourou), Kutin, (Koutine), Laka-Mbere, Chamba, Doayo, Fali, Mundang (Moundang), and Tupuri (Toupouri). The Kanem- Bornu Empire of Lake Chad had relations with these tribes. They called the area Fumbina or Mabina (a name which denoted the present province as well as territories in present-day Nigeria and the Central African Republic). The Kanem-Bornu also introduced Islam to the region between 1349 and 1385 by way of the Islamic centre at Kano in present-day Nigeria. However, no more than a few rulers, nobles or merchants ever converted. Many more tribes entered the territory from the region of Chad between the 14th and 17th centuries. These included the Semi-Bantu tribes, such as the Bamileke, Bamun, Kom, Nso, Tikar, Widikum, and Wimbam. The Bantu came as well, examples being the Beti-Pahuin and Maka and Njem. Other groups who came were the Gbaya, from the present CAR, and the Vute, from the Lake Chad region. The Vute were region's first iron workers, and they founded the towns of Mbamnyang (present Banyo) and Tibar√© (present Tibati). The Semi-Bantu peoples gradually moved south before settling near the headwaters of the Mbam River sometime between the 17th and 19th centuries. The Bantu settled east of them, south of the Adamawa Plateau. One or all of these populations founded Banyo, Tibati, and Ngaound√©r√©. Meanwhile, the Bantu and Semi-Bantu invasions drove the longer-established Sudanese peoples north. The Mbum, Ndoro, Kutin, and Laka-Mbere moved to the present-day province's northern reaches, while the other Sudanese migrated even farther. This period marked the highest population for the Adamawa territory until modern times. However, one event had drastic consequences for the region: the arrival of the Fulbe. =Fulbe jihads= Early Fulbe settlers entered the Adamawa from present-day Nigeria or northern Cameroon as early as the 13th century. These settlers and nomads were never numerous, however, and they often held subservient status to other tribes. Over time, however, the steady stream of Fulbe immigrants allowed Fulbe communities to spring up in many areas. These early Fulbe converted to Islam sometime in the 17th century, beginning with the settled, or town, Fulbe. In 1804, Fulbe in the territory and beyond were growing disenchanted with submission to pagan tribes. They were also hungry for larger territories that they could use for cattle grazing. The Fulbe leader Usman dan Fodio responded to this sentiment and called a jihad. Usman named his lieutenant Modima Adam Al-Hasan, or Modibo Adama, lamido of Fumbina, and Adama quickly raised an army in the territory. Adama's forces proved all but unstoppable. He conquered major Vute centres at Mbamnyang and Tibar√© in 1835, which he renamed Banyo and Tibati. At Adama's death in 1847, Fulbe horsemen controlled territory from the Niger River to the west and the Logone to the east and from the Sahara to the north and the Sanaga River to the south to form the Sokoto Caliphate. Adama's emirate (known as the Adamawa Emirate) was divided into districts under governors; the Adamawa Plateau fell into the Ngaound√©r√© subdivision. Fighting against native peoples continued for many years. Around 1830, the Fulbe conquered the Mbum village of Delb√©, which they renamed Ngaound√©r√©, after a nearby hill. Many Mbum converted to Islam and remained, though many others migrated north. The town became the seat of the lamidat of Ardo Ndjobdi. Beginning around 1835, Fulbe immigrants streamed into the newly conquered territories in large numbers. By 1850, the Fulbe were firmly entrenched in northern Cameroon. Native populations were subjugated and placed under the rule of the local lamidos. Native populations were forced to convert to Islam, face enslavement, or flee. Fulbe merchants accepted salt and horses from North Africa in exchange for slaves for sale in the Muslim empires to the north. A smaller number of slaves went south for the trans-Atlantic market. Those groups who resisted had no choice but to flee to the unforgiving mountains or else to the jungle south. Those groups who were immediate neighbours to the warring Fulbe, such as the Vute and Gbaya, dislodged others who lay in their path, such as Cameroon's Bantu peoples. The Fulbe jihads thus served as the single most important event in the peopling of southern Cameroon. The jihad only served to depopulate Cameroon's north, however. The Fulbe invaders did not set up new settlements. Rather, they used their conquered lands as pasture for their cattle. Many of these groups were still migrating when they came into contact with Cameroon's new colonisers: The Germans. =European contacts= British explorers were the first Europeans to enter Adamawa territory when they came in 1822. The German Dr. Gustav Nachtigal was the first Westerner to explore the region extensively, which he did between 1869 and 1873. Nachtigal kept a keen eye out to notice what groups lived in the region, what their relations were like with their neighbours, and what resources could possibly be exploited from the area. The British Eduard E. Flegel followed Nachtigal in 1882. He explored the Adamawa emirate, setting up trade and reaching as far south as Banyo. He died in 1883, however, still on expedition, and peaceful contact between the West and the Fulbe empire came to an end. Instead, Germany annexed part of Adama's empire in 1884, and the other part became part of British Nigeria. As far as Europe was concerned, the Adama emirate no longer existed. =German administration= The Fulbe fiercely opposed German hegemony. The German governor Jesko von Puttkamer sent soldiers under Captain Von Kamptz to suppress the uprisings, and on 7 May 1899, Banyo became the first major town to surrender. Tibati fell a month later, and Ngaound√©r√© followed on 20 September 1901. The Adamawa Plateau was now largely pacified, and the Germans pushed north toward the important trade town of Garoua. Germany eventually prevailed against the Fulbe, and the present Adamawa fell into the Ngaound√©r√© administrative area, or \\"residency\\". From 1902 to 1903, Germany allowed most lamidos to stay in power, albeit under German supervision; rulers who refused to cooperate were replaced. The colonials also encouraged the Islamisation of the area's non-Muslim inhabitants, as this would place them under the rule of the lamidos, who were already submissive to the German governor. =French administration= Germany's 1916 defeat in Africa in World War I eventually gave control of the territory to the French, the region's third occupying force in less than a century. The new governors placed the region in the Mora-Garoua administrative area with its capital at Garoua. French colonial policies varied little from their German predecessors. Lamidos were left in nominal power, though they were expected to carry out French policies. France also did away with recalcitrant rulers, and by 1936, the region had 39 lamidos and one sultan. France's main contribution to the region was its improvements to infrastructure. Road construction, in particular, accelerated during French rule, and the colonials had a road built from Foumban to Garoua via Banyo, Tibati, and Ngaound√©r√©. In 1956, France made all of its West African colonies self-governing. Andr√©-Marie Mbida became the first premier of Cameroon. Mbida quickly alienated the Muslim north, however, when he introduced his Abong-Mbang Resolutions. One of these called for the \\"democratisation\\" of northern Cameroon, which the Muslim rulers feared was code for bringing an end to their influence. Muslim leaders thus threatened to secede from Cameroon and join French Chad unless the resolutions were recalled. The events eventually led to Mbida's expulsion from the prime ministry and his replacement by Ahmadou Ahidjo, a Muslim from the country's north. =Post-independence= Ahidjo became Cameroon's first president after the country's independence on 1 January 1960. He devoted substantial resources to developing his northern homeland, such as the extension of a road north from Yaound√© to better link Cameroon's north and south. The railroad followed soon thereafter, construction beginning in 1961 and reaching Ngaound√©r√© ten years later. The northern Muslims largely viewed the arrival of Cameroon's second president, Paul Biya, suspiciously. This was largely due to an Ahidjo partisan named Moussa Yaya, whom Biya and the press accused of trying to turn the lamidos against the new leader. Biya enjoys some support in the province today, but his popularity is nowhere near as strong as in Cameroon's south. Part of this is because Biya's main activities in the north have been minimal. He split the North Province into three parts in 1983, thus creating the Far North Region (Cameroon), North, and Adamawa Provinces as they exist today. He also absorbed the University of Ngaound√©r√© into the national system. In the first months of 2014, thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in the Central African Republic arrived in Cameroon via the border towns of the Adamawa Region, East Region, and North Region. 2008 presidential decree abolishes provinces In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing \\"Provinces\\" and replacing them with \\"Regions\\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions. Geography =Land= The Adamawa is one of Cameroon's more geologically diverse areas. The Gotel and Mambila Mountains at the border with Nigeria are largely composed of granite, which gives way to crystalline and metamorphic rock such as mica, schists, and gneiss. These are often covered in volcanic basalt, a combination that dominates until the Faro River. East of this, granites once again prevail, though sedimentary rock forms the valley of the Mb√©r√© River, and a zone of metamorphic rock surrounds this. The Lom River also rises in a region of metamorphic rock. Volcanic rock occurs in the northwest just east of the Gotel Mountains and northeast of Ngaound√©r√©, the provincial capital, along the border with the North Province. Soils are mostly made up of brown or brownish-red laterites, the result of the annual shift between dry and wet conditions and soil wash on the mountains. Iron and aluminium content is high, which causes hardpans, duracrust, or cuirasses to form near the surface due to oxidation. The soil of the Lom valley is a lightly evolved composition of raw materials, as is that directly northwest of the Mbakaou Reservoir and directly west of the Faro River. The extreme northwest of the province has ferruginous soil instead, and many of the province's mountains, including the Gotels and Mambilas, contain mixtures of several soil types. =Drainage= The Adamawa is sometimes dubbed the \\"water tower\\" of Cameroon, since a large number of the country's rivers rise in the area. All of these fall into a tropical regime, with a period of high water from May to September during the rainy season, and a period of low water ‚Äì or even complete dryness ‚Äì from October to April. Some of these are subject to seasonal flooding as well, such as the Dj√©rem in the area of the Mbakaou Reservoir. The province's rivers fall into three different basins: those that ultimately flow into the Niger River, to Lake Chad, and to the Atlantic Ocean. The Mayo Deo River rises in the Gotel Mountains and then flows into the North Province. The Faro River begins a short distance east of the Mayo Deo but follows a wide, arcing course east and north between the Vina division and the Faro and Deo division before entering the North Province (the two rivers eventually join). Two major rivers lie in the Chad basin. The Mb√©r√© rises north of the town of Meiganga and then flows northeast toward the border with the North Province and the Central Africa Republic. The headwaters of the Vina River flow just north of Ngaound√©r√© before the river enters the North Province. These two rivers eventually merge to form the Logone River. The Mbam, Kim, and Dj√©rem are the major rivers of the Atlantic basin. The Mbam and Kim both rise in the southwest before flowing into the Centre Province. The Dj√©rem forms in eastern and western branches, which converge at the Mbakaou Reservoir. The river then flows south into the East Province. Due to the reservoir (which holds two million cubic metres of water), the Dj√©rem forms an important source of hydroelectric power for Cameroon. Finally, the Lom rises about 60 km east of Meiganga before flowing south into the East Province. The Dj√©rem eventually becomes the Sanaga River, and these other rivers ultimately empty into it. A long history of volcanism has also created a number of crater lakes in the province, the results of collapsed volcanoes filling with water. Among the most well known are Lakes Tison (Tyson, Tisson) and Mbalang near Ngaound√©r√©. File:Lac de Mballang pr√®s de Ngaound√©r√©1.jpgLake Mbalang near to Ngaoundere File:Le lac de crat√®re de Tizon √† Ngaound√©r√©.jpgLake Tizon at Ngaoundere File:Chute vina1.jpgVina River located in Ngaound√©r√© File:Le fleuve logone.jpgLogone River located between Cameroon and Chad File:Alentour fleuve sanaga 04.jpgSanaga River File:Fleuve Mbam'.jpgMbam River =Relief= Hills and savanna near Ngaoundal Trays in Adamawa Powerful geothermal forces have shaped the Adamawa. The province begins to the south as part of the South Cameroon Plateau. The land rises gently but unevenly until about 6 degrees latitude. Here begins the Adamawa Plateau, a band of terrain that ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 m in altitude (averaging about 1,100 m) and stretches from Nigeria to the CAR. Altitude dips to as low of 500 m in the Dj√©rem and Mb√©r√© valleys and at the border north of Ngaound√©r√©. The plateau continues to about 8 degrees north before descending to the Benu√© Depression in abrupt cliffs and active volcanoes (though this transitional zone is mostly in the North Province). Faults also cut across the area, the major one being the Cameroon Fault, dating from the Cretaceous Period. The Mbang Mountains follow this fault in a rough cut toward the east. Other mountains dot the province, as well. The Mambilas stretch into the extreme southwest from Nigeria and the Northwest and West Provinces. The Gotels are north of these along the border with Nigeria. All of these mountains form part of the Cameroon Ridge. Tchabal Mbabo, in the Gotels, is the highest peak at 2,460 m. =Climate= The province's high elevation lends it a relatively cool climate average between 22 and 25 degrees Celsius. However, specific conditions vary between the South Cameroon and Adamawa Plateaus. The former experiences an equatorial climate of the Guinea type with four seasons: a long, dry period from December to May, a short, wet period from May to June, a short, dry season from July to October, and finally a long, wet season from October to November. The climate of the Adamawa Plateau is classified as tropical of the Sudan type. It has only two seasons; November begins the dry period, and April the wet. Rainfall here averages 900 to 1,500 mm per year and decreases further north. May and June are the wettest, with occasional tornadoes; August is another rainfall peak. In addition, temperatures dip from November to January, as conditions similar to those that cause winter in temperate climes take at least a tentative hold. Temperatures rise due to the Harmattan beginning in January, reaching a high in April. Torrential rains in May and June bring temperatures down once again. A third climate type characterises the Adamawa's southwest corner (most of the Mayo-Banyo division). This region experiences an equatorial climate of the Cameroon type. Rainfall is within 1,500 to 2,000 mm with a long dry period followed by a long wet period. =Plant and animal life= The Adamawa's vegetation has been shaped greatly by man. It was once highly forested, but repeated brush burning and cattle trampling have changed the terrain. In the south, this is Guinean savanna, a transitional zone between Cameroon's forested south and desert north. On the plateau itself, the savanna continues, though it is less wooded. Grass cover is consistent and thick, and the original vegetation still survives in the river valleys. What few trees dot the landscape are evergreen and deciduous until about 1800 m altitude, when ferns and bamboos become prevalent. Grasses are the dominant form of plant life throughout except in the few forested areas and in some regions of scrubby bush. In addition, the southwestern half of the Mayo-Banyo division is a more heavily forested woodland savanna. The Adamawa has two national reserves. The first of these is the Parc National du Mbam et Dj√©rem, which protects 4165 km¬≤ in both the Adamawa and East Provinces. The park is notable for containing both large tracts of savanna and forest. In addition, a small portion of the Parc National de Boumba Ndjida extends into the territory from the North Province. Demographics =Settlement patterns= Downtown Ngaound√©r√© The Adamawa is sparsely populated. Large swathes of land are devoted almost entirely to the use of Fulbe cattle herders, this pasture punctuated only by occasional settlements. The Cameroonian government has made efforts to persuade Fulbe herdsmen to adopt sedentary ways, but the nomadic traditions show little signs of change. Because the savanna has been pushing south, however, there is now a substantial amount of immigration to the Centre and East Provinces. Ngaound√©r√© is one of Cameroon's fastest growing cities due to its location at the terminus of Cameroon's north-south railroad. The modern city is thus a sprawling mass of winding streets surrounding the traditional town. It is also a microcosm of the province's ethnic diversity, as representatives of most of the Adamawa's peoples can be found there. The Mayo- Banyo division in the southwest has a slightly higher population density than the rest of the province, largely due to the highly concentrated Mambila and Konja of the Mambila Mountains and the Vute and Pere of the Gotel Mountains. The Pere are also known as the Kutin or Koutine, though this is in fact a highly derogatory term meaning \\"dogs\\" that was given to them by the Fulbe. The northern border also has a slightly higher population density than the Fulbe interior. =People= Territories of ethnic groups of the Adamawa Province Language provides the most convenient means of categorising the Adamawa's ethnic groups. The greatest number of peoples speak various Southern Bantoid languages. These Bantoid peoples primarily occupy the province's western third, in the Faro and Deo and the Mayo-Banyo divisions. The Ndoro are the northernmost, living on the Nigerian border on the upper Mayo Deo. To their south lie the Nyem-Nyem, called Suga by the Mbum, in the northern third of Mayo-Banyo division and along the west bank of the Meng River. The Vute live south of them on the Nigerian border and in a second population centre on the southwestern bank of the Mbarkaou Reservoir. The Mambila inhabit the southwestern border, and the Konja lie inland from them along the Banyo-Bankim road. The Tikar are at the province's southwestern corner, with territories extending into the neighbouring provinces. Those peoples who speak Adamawa languages constitute the next major grouping. The Pere are farthest west of these, living in three main concentrations. The first is at the province's northwest, north of Mayo-Baleo town. They have another centre at the village of Paro south of Tign√®re, and their third grouping on the Meng River. The Kali at the province's northeast, along the North Province border centred at B√©l√©l. The Mbum (Mboum) are the last group, occupying the town of Ngaoundal and its environs. East of Ngaound√©r√© are the Dii, who have larger territories in the North Province. As speakers of an Ubangi language, the Gbaya make up another important grouping. Their territory spans the whole of the Mb√©r√© division as well as a small area at the southwest of the Vina division. They continue south into the East Province. The Fulbe make up an estimated 60% of the Adamawa's population. They are further subdivided into two subgroups: the sedentary, or town, Fulbe and the pastoral Fulbe, or Bororo. The sedentary Fulbe are more numerous and inhabit most of the province's major towns, including Banyo, Tibati, Tign√®re, and Ngaound√©r√©, the capital. Over years of intermixing with native populations, they have come to physically resemble their Sudanese neighbours. The pastoral Fulbe create only temporary settlements, preferring instead to range across the province and beyond with large herds of cattle. These Fulbe are lighter skinned than their town brethren, tall and thin, with Arab-looking features. The Fulbe speak a Cameroonian dialect of the Senegambian language Fulfulde. Due to their historical hegemony of the territory, it also serves as a lingua franca. Other major languages include Bitare, Dii, Gbaya, Mambila, and Tikar. Most educated inhabitants also speak French. =Religion= Islam is followed by many in Adamawa, especially among the Fulbe majority. Even among them, however, there is a noted difference between the sedentary Fulbe, who are more religious, and the nomadic Bororo, who are often only nominally Muslim. Christianity has made many inroads, though Christians are in a distinct minority. Many of the tribes retain animist, or \\"pagan\\", beliefs, particularly in the mountains near the Nigerian border. Economy =Livestock= The Adamawa's economy is based almost entirely on one single thing: cattle, a Fulbe monopoly. The region's low population, high humidity, and vast fields of grass make it ideal for grazing. Herdsmen rotate pastures, and they often construct watering holes or wells for themselves and their animals. The close relationship between the Bororo and their herds lends a great cultural importance to a Fulbe's number of cattle, and the more heads of cattle a man has, the wealthier he is. This often leads herders to never kill their animals, however, and to keep sick animals alive for fear of losing a portion of one's net worth. Nevertheless, many Fulbe herders transport their cattle to the big markets of Yaound√© and Douala for sale (some make it as far as Gabon and Congo). The major transhumance paths are in the western third of the province and at the border with Chad. Most of these animals are of the humpbacked zebu breed. Near Ngaound√©r√© and Banyo, these are called Fulani zebu, large and meaty animals with dark-brown hides and white spots. The nomadic Fulbe, on the other hand, herd Bororo zebu. These are leaner, lighter-coloured beasts that are better able to travel long distances. The government-run Institut de R√©cherche Zootechniques (IZR) and SODEPA have established a handful of modern cattle ranches, as well. The major ones are near the villages of Laro, Wakwo and Ndokayo. Here, ranchers have bred new breeds of cattle by mixing native Fulbe animals with the American Brahmin. Government initiatives have also been instrumental in the eradication of the tsetse fly in the region. Many ranchers and Bororo also raise horses and donkeys. In addition, the Adamawa has more goats and sheep than any other province, as these can live even in the larger towns. Pigs, however, are much less common due to the prevalence of Islam in the region. =Agriculture= Nearly all farming in the province is done at the sustenance level. Millet is the mainstay, though maize, and manioc are also important. Other crops, grown in smaller quantities, include cocoyams, yams, and groundnuts. The Gbaya, Mbum, and Dourou are the region's most prolific farmers, though even the herdsmen farm in the rainy season. Farms are typically small plots that are cleared or burned out of the brush and then planted during the dry season. Crops grow during the rainy season, when they are harvested. Because the dry season is so long, crops must be preserved, so most are transformed into grain, which is pounded by hand with mortar and pestle. Cash crops play a small role in the region's economy. SODEBLE grows wheat on 100 km¬≤ at Wassand√©, near Ngaound√©r√©. The southwestern Mayo-Banyo division also has some coffee plots. Other interests have established groundnut, millet, and wheat plantations in recent years. =Industry= The Adamawa has a bit of industry, most located in the capital. Much of this is tied to the region's cattle-based economy. For example, leatherworking is an important industry in Ngaound√©r√©, as evidenced by the Soci√©t√© des Tanneries et Peausseries du Cameroun (STPC) factory. Rubber, perfume, and dairy products are also processed in the capital. Handicrafts, including woodworking and mat weaving, form another sector. Tin is mined near Mayo Darl√© and the Nigerian border and southwest of Banyo, and bauxite is mined near Ngaoundal and Minim- Martap. Mineral water is obtained at Doungu√©. =Transport = Ngaound√©r√© is the gateway to the province, and it is most easily accessible from southern Cameroon via the \\"Transcam II\\" rail line. The trip takes between 12 and 30 hours, but the presence of couchettes makes the journey bearable for those who can afford them. Other passengers are crammed into all available seats, however, including those in the dining car. Due to the overcrowded conditions, thieves are another hazard. Road travel from the south is also possible, but this is limited to poor roads from the Centre Province or else a long detour through the East Province, where the roads are not much better. Roads within the Adamawa itself are mostly unpaved and are often in poor condition (particularly south of Ngaound√©r√©) due to little maintenance. The road north from Ngaound√©r√© into the North Province is paved, however, meaning that those traveling via train can continue to the North and Far North without too much discomfort. National Road 6 enters the province from Foumban in the West Province and continues on to Banyo, Tibati, and Me√Øganga. National Road 15 comes from Sangb√© in the Centre Province to Tibati and on to Ngaound√©r√©. A regional airport services Ngaound√©r√© with flights to Yaound√©, Douala, Garoua, and Maroua. Tign√®re, Banyo, Ngaoundal, Tibati, and the Mbakaou Reservoir all have airstrips. =Tourism= Running water from the Vina waterfall located in Ngaoundere Most travellers see the Adamawa only briefly as they transition at Ngaound√©r√© from the train to a bus further north. The province does see some visitors who are interested in the region's rich cultural history. A number of lamidos allow tourists to visit their palaces, for example, such as the ruler of Ngo, who receives nobles every Friday and Sunday. The province also has numerous scenic destinations ranging from crater lakes to caves and waterfalls. Administration and social conditions What social inequalities exist in the Adamawa largely stem from the region's high level of cultural homogeneity. Most people in the province are Muslim Fulbe, and those who are not often fall prey to racism and discrimination, especially in more rural areas. The Cameroonian government has made efforts to encourage the region's nomads to settle, but so far has made little progress. With its low population, the Adamawa holds little import to Cameroonian politicians. However, the Fulbe tribe is spread throughout the country, especially in the three northern provinces, and together they form a significant bloc that Cameroonian politicians cannot easily ignore. This is one way that Cameroon's greater north is able to oppose policies more favourable to the south. =Government= Departments of Adamawa Adamawa is composed of five departments ('): # Dj√©rem, with its capital at Tibati # Faro-et-D√©o, with its headquarters in Tign√®re # Mayo-Banyo, with its capital in Banyo # Mb√©r√©, headed from Meiganga # Vina, governed from Ngaound√©r√© A presidentially appointed prefect ('), or senior divisional officer, governs each of these. The president also appoints the governor, whose offices are in Ngaound√©r√©. Traditional political organisation Lamidos, traditional Muslim rulers, still hold great sway over their Fulbe subjects. Most large towns in the province have a lamido, and many smaller villages do as well. The various lamidos elect councilors to serve them; these may come from both Fulbe and other tribal groups. The Cameroonian government permits these rulers to hold their own courts and to keep their own jails, something human rights groups have pointed to as problematic. Most other tribes in the region are nominally under the rule of a chief. However, these men are mostly just figureheads today. Among the Tikar, however, these individuals still hold a substantial amount of power. A group of advisers, or \\"Council of Notables\\", serves each Tikar chief. Below them are various ward heads (') who govern a specific portion of a village or town. The quarter chiefs (') hold sway over a particular neighbourhood. =Education= The Adamawa's education level is generally very low. The nomadic Bororo rarely send their children to school. Meanwhile, town Fulbe often marry their daughters off early into puberty, and married girls do not go to school. The province has an estimated 80% illiteracy rate. Another obstacle is lack of schools and teachers. Most schools are located in larger towns or in the capital, meaning that students often must travel long distances or live away from home, particularly at the secondary level. In addition, Cameroonian teachers who are assigned to the province often refuse to go on account of its remoteness. =Health= Most of the Adamawa's towns have some form of health provider, if only a small clinic. The capital also has a hospital. The region's major health concern is lack of sanitation. This is especially pronounced in the increasingly urbanised Ngaound√©r√©. Another concern is HIV and AIDS. Official government figures give the province an HIV-infection rate of 17%, the highest in the country. These numbers come from samples in Ngaound√©r√© only, however, and infection rates in more rural areas are probably lower. =Cultural life= The Adamawa maintains a lively traditional culture. One notable example is the Menang, a Tikar dance. Performers may dance for any number of reasons, from aiding warriors to celebrating women's sensuality. Births, funerals, and weddings are often occasion for grand celebration among the region's non-Muslim populations, as well. References * Fanso, V.G.

Details Brooke was a 30-year-old lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the First Battle of Ypres for which he was awarded the VC. On 29 October 1914 near Gheluvelt, Belgium, Lieutenant Brooke led two attacks on the German trenches under heavy rifle and machine- gun fire, regaining a lost trench at a very critical moment. By his marked coolness and promptitude on this occasion, Lieutenant Brooke prevented the enemy from breaking through the British line at a time when a general counter- attack could not have been organised. Having regained the lost trench, he went back to bring up supports, and while doing so, was killed. Lieutenant Brooke was posthumously promoted to captain, effective to September 1914. Memorials Captain Brooke's remains were interred at Zantvoorde British Cemetery (CWGC), Zonnebeke, Belgium (near Ypres).CWGC entry His name also appears on the family grave at Springbank Cemetery, Aberdeen. His name also appears on Aberdeen War Memorial, Colebrook War Memorial, St Ronan's Church Memorial, and Enniskillen War Memorial. A 21 cm mortar he captured is on display at Enniskillen Castle. A Victoria Cross commemorate stone bearing his name was laid at Kingswells Hall near Aberdeen in October 2014 to mark the centenary of the award. The hall was built with the help of Brooke and the church war memorial sited opposite also bears his name.

It borders the Northwest Region to the northwest, the Adamawa Region to the northeast, the Centre Region to the southeast, the Littoral Region to the southwest, and the Southwest Region to the west. The West Region is the smallest of Cameroon's ten regions in area, yet it has the highest population density. As home to the enterprising Bamoun kingdom, the West is an economic bright spot and one of Cameroon's more developed regions. This progressive development is tempered by the strong traditional culture that persists among the Bamileke and the province's other major ethnic group, the Bamum (sometimes Bamoum, Bamun, Bamoun). Geography =Land= The West sits at the geologic crossroads of Cameroon; the soil varies greatly within a relatively small land area. The land along the Noun River and at the Bamendjing Reservoir, for example, is a lightly evolved blend of various raw minerals. The province's western half, on the other hand, is a haphazard mixture of raw minerals, granite, ferrallitic patches of red dirt, and other types. Finally, the soil of the eastern portions away from the reservoir is ferrallitic. Rocks in the area range from the volcanic along the reservoir and Noun to Precambrian deposits of crystalline rocks such as granite and gneiss under a cover of basaltic rock in the northwest. Metamorphic rocks like gneiss and mica dominate the rest of the territory. The soil throughout is mostly red in color due to high iron content, though that of the northwest is black or brown basalt. The province's soils are the richest and most productive in Cameroon. =Drainage= The West's mountainous terrain and active tectonics create many fast-moving rivers with picturesque falls and isolated crater lakes. These rivers follow a Cameroon regime, experiencing a period of high waters during the wet season and a period of low waters in the dry period. The rivers all form part of the Atlantic basin. The Mbam River runs along the border with the Centre and Southeast Provinces. The Nkam is the name for the headwaters of the Wouri River, which flow from the West's Bamboutos Mountains. The eastern branch through the area rises northwest of Bangangt√©, and the western branch forms the border with the Littoral Province southwest of Bafang. These headwaters are subject to seasonal flooding. The Noun River, a tributary of the Sanaga, flows from the Centre Province, around Bafoussam, and to the Bamendjing Reservoir. This man- made lake is created by a dam on the Noun River, which helps regulate the Sanaga at Ed√©a in the Littoral Province and is thus an important component in Cameroon's supply of hydroelectric power. Falls are common, such as the Balatchi, Metch√©, and Tsugning Falls. Most of the West's lakes are crater lakes formed from collapsed volcanoes. Such lakes exist at Balent, Ban√©fo, Doup√©, and near Foumban. Many of these still have active volcanoes at their bottoms, particularly in the northwest on the Western High Plateau. One example is Lake Baleng, northeast of Bafoussam, and the twin lakes of Foumbot. These volcanoes can cause deposits of gas to build up at the lakebed until poisonous gases finally bubble to the surface. Such an eruption at Lake Monoun killed 37 villagers near Foumbot on 15 and 16 August 1984. File:Lac Baleng2.jpgLake Baleng File:Fleuve Nkam √† partir de Bafang 01.jpgNkam River File:Monoun.jpgLake Monoun File:Fleuve Mbam'.jpgMbam River File:Chutes d'eau de Metchie.jpgMetche falls File:Chute Bangoua30.jpgBangoua Falls =Relief= The Bamboutos Mountains are the West's primary land feature. Elevations reach as high as 2,000 metres and dip as low as 500 metres in the Noun and Nkam valleys. The highest point is Mt. Bamboutos, a dormant volcano west of Mbouda, at 2,740 metres. These mountains lie along the Cameroon Fault, dating from the Cretaceous, which runs roughly parallel to the border with the Northwest Province and through the capital of Bafoussam. West of the Cameroon Mountains lies the Western High Plateau, with elevations of 1,000-2,500 metres. South of the fault, the land descends in steps until levelling off at the South Cameroon Plateau. Here, terrain is gentler, with large hills separated by deep valleys. =Climate= High elevations and moderate to high humidity give the West one of Cameroon's more pleasant climates. Temperatures average a cool 22Àô, and rainfall is moderate. Except for the southeasternmost portions, the West experiences two major seasons in lieu of the traditional four: the year begins in a long, dry period of little rain, which runs until May, then the rains begin in May or June and last until October or November. Though the transition is gradual, the southeastern reaches of the province are part of the South Cameroon Plateau and thus have four seasons: the long dry season from December to March, the short rainy season from March to June, the short dry season from June to August, and the long rainy season from September to December. The climate is equatorial of the Cameroon sub-variety in the northwestern third and equatorial of the Guinea type in the southeastern two- thirds. Rainfall, moderated by the mountains, averages 1,000-2,000 mm per year throughout, though it is highest at the area of the Bamendjing Reservoir. =Plant and animal life= Very little of the West's original flora or fauna survives, since most land has been cleared by human farmers. This is particularly evident on the Western High Plateau, where poor soil and less rainfall have exacerbated the effects of deforestation, turning the area into grassland. The Melap Reserve (R√©serve de Melap) near Foumban is one heavily wooded area, but it is more of a city park than an actual reserve. East of the Noun River, the terrain is primarily covered in woodland savanna of the Sahel type, which forms a transitional zone to the lowly vegetated northern provinces. West of that river, this savanna is of the Sudan type, and is interspersed among open, dry forest. A few small patches of rain forest persist to the west of the Mbam River in the Noun division. As elevation increases, forests thin out, until they are replaced by ferns and bamboos at 1,800 metres. Trees throughout shed their leaves during the dry season as protection against brush fires. Demographics =Settlement patterns= Bamileke dwellings, such as this one in Bandjoun, are typically separated by fences. The West's population density is high in general, especially in the towns of Bafoussam, Dschang, Mbouda, and Bafang. This is due to the pleasant climate and fertile soils. Bafoussam is both the provincial capital and the centre of the Bamileke lands. Populations thin out toward the southern border and in the eastern Bamum-dominated territories. Settlements are scattered. The region experiences significant out-migration, particularly when the vast plantations of the Southwest Province hire workers for annual harvests. Permanent emigration is mainly by those who wish to escape the overcrowded conditions and to farm larger pieces of land, and is directed mainly to the Southwest and Littoral Provinces. Bamileke homes are traditionally made of dried earth placed on a bamboo frame and covered by a thatched roof. Farm plots separated by fences surround the typical home. Houses of this type are seldom seen today, however, though barns are still constructed using these methods. The last bastion of traditional architecture are the many chiefs' compounds that dot the province. These are characterized by their tall, conical roofs, bamboo and clay-brick walls, and carved poles around the entryway. The typical layout places a central audience chamber in front of other rooms for individuals of progressively lower rank. Territories of West Province ethnic groups =People= Two major tribal groups dominate the West: the Bamileke and the Bamum. Both of these are considered semi-Bantu or grassfields Bantu. The Bamileke are the more numerous, estimated to number 3000000 or more. They are concentrated southeast of the Bamboutos Mountains and west of the Noun River. Their major settlements are at Bafoussam, Bandjoun, Bafang, Bawaju, Bangangt√©, Dschang, and Mbouda. They organise themselves in sub-groups, each under the rule of a different chief. Examples are the Fe'fe', Ghomala, Kwa', Medumba, Mengaka, Nda'nda', Ngomba, Ngombale, Ngiemboon, and Yemba. Most of these groups speak a unique language, though all are closely related. Most Bamileke are Christian, with Catholics in the majority. The Bamum people are the area's other major ethnic group. They are a subgroup of the Tikar, though they speak a language called Bamum. They are primarily Islamic, and all are ruled by a sultan in their tribal capital, Foumban. Other languages spoken in the province include Bamenyam, Mbo, and Tikar. Most educated inhabitants also speak French. Economy The West is one of Cameroon's soundest economic areas due primarily to its agricultural prosperity and the enterprising traditions of the Bamileke people. In areas that do not have a daily market, market days are typically every eighth day (the Bamileke follow an eight-day week). =Agriculture= Subsistence farming The Bamileke are skilled farmers who exploit virtually every strip of land available. Along with the neighbouring Northwest Province, the West supplies most of the food consumed in Cameroon's seven lower provinces. Tools are largely traditional. Farmers plant after the first rains in fields consisting of alternating ridges and furrows. In the past, farmers practiced field rotation, allowing land to lie fallow for two or three years. Due to increasing population density, however, they use the land almost continuously today; the loss in fertility is partially countered through extensive use of fertilisers and manure. Hedges or fences that separate private plots and keep out animals surround farms in the West. These hedges also provide firewood and help prevent from soil erosion. In the Southeast, farmers sometimes place fields in forest clearings where they use slash-and-burn agriculture. Maize is the major staple, and farmers surround rows of it with cocoyams, plantains, beans, groundnuts, melons, and yams. Potatoes are another mainstay, and the West is one of the few places in Cameroon where they grow well due to high elevations in the region. Farmers grow these crops on the hillsides and use the valleys to plant cocoyams, colocasia, and raffia palms. In the western Wouri valley, rice is also important. Plantation agriculture Population pressures prevent entrepreneurs from establishing large plantations more prevalently in the West. Coffee is the major cash crop, with large fields in the regions of Bafoussam, Foumbot, and Dschang and powerful supervision by Union des Cooperatives de Caf√© Arabica de l'Ouest (UCCAO). Cocoa is also important, particularly in the lowlands. Tea is grown commercially near Dschang. Some rice cultivation takes place under the Upper Noun Development Company (UNVDA) in the southeast, largely due to government projects. Tobacco from Mbouda and Foumbot stays within the province for local consumption, though the Bastos Company of Yaound√© processes some for export. Livestock Livestock raising was once practiced more widely, but as populations have risen, most land has been converted to crop cultivation (a fact that has raised tensions between herders and farmers). Still, some herders drive cattle using transhumance methods in the northwestern half of the province, and the Kounden area is home to some modern ranching. Ranchers sell these animals, which account for 10% of Cameroon's beef, mostly in the Douala market. Many farmers raise sheep and goats in the southeastern half of the province. Increasingly common these days are poultry and pigs, which can live in pens on smaller farms. In fact, the majority of Cameroon's pork comes from the region, and a large government-run poultry farm operates at Kounden. Smallholder farmers, especially women, keep domestic cavies in their homesteads that may provide more protein to family nutrition than any other meat source.Ngou-Ngoupayou, J.D., Kouonmenioc, J., Fotso Tagny, J.M., Cicogna, M., Castroville, C., Rigoni, M. and Hardouin, J. 1995. Possibilit√©s de d√©veloppement de l'√©levage du cobaye en Afrique subsaharienne: le cas du Cameroun. World Animal Review (FAO/AGA) 83(2): 21‚Äì28 The Bamendjing is also the site of traditional fishing, and professional fisheries operate at Foumban. Bamum artisan at work in Foumban =Industry= The West is home to relatively little industry. The area's few factories are almost all devoted to food processing, with plants in Bafoussam (beer, instant coffee), Foumbot, Dschang, and K√©kem. The building materials, pharmaceuticals, and bauxite mining industries also have a presence. Arts and crafts form the heart of the West's production. Particularly renowned are the goods produced by Bamum cooperatives at Foumban. These include intricately decorated ceramics made from Foumban's high-quality clay, woodworking, brass and bronze casting, and cotton textiles, often featuring elaborate embroidery. The Bamileke are also skilled artisans, with their own cooperative at Bafoussam. =Transportation = With such a small land area and large network of mostly paved roads, the West is one of Cameroon's more accessible provinces. Major routes through the area include National Road 4 to Yaound√©, National Road 5 from B√©koko to Bandjoun, and National Road 6 (dubbed la Transafricaine) from Ekok, Mamfe and Bamenda in the Northwest Province through Mbouda and Foumban to Banyo and beyond in the Adamawa. Bafoussam forms an important nexus between the cities of Bamenda, Douala, Yaound√©, and Foumban. Roads often must wind and sharply turn to traverse the region's mountains, and traffic accidents are not uncommon. The region is reachable by air via domestic airports at Bafoussam and Koutaba and an airstrip at Dschang. =Tourism= With its legions of artisans and its lavish sultan's palace, Foumban forms the West's main tourist draw. Visitors also come to experience the region's magnificent scenery and rich traditional culture. Administration and social conditions The West's high population and economic dominance lend it great political importance. However, Cameroon's government and state-run media, largely run by President Paul Biya's numerically inferior Beti-Pahuin tribal group, are often accused of anti-Bamileke bias. The Bamileke thus stand to gain a great deal from a more free and transparent government, and the West harbors many sympathisers for the presidential party's main opponents, the Social Democratic Front. =Government= Divisions of West Cameroon The West consists of eight divisions or departments (departements), each headed by a prefect (prefet), or senior divisional officer. The president appoints all of these officers and the provincial governor in Bafoussam. A special urban council presides over Bafoussam, staffed by presidentially appointed counselors who serve under a presidentially appointed delegate. The Noun department, headquartered at Foumban, is the largest division geographically and occupies most of the Bamum territories bordering the Adamawa and Centre Provinces. The Nd√© department is southwest of this with its capital at Bangangt√©. The Haut-Nkam (Upper Nkam) department, whose capital is Bafang, is further west, and the M√©noua department borders it to the northwest with its capital at Dschang. The Mifi department, with its capital Bafoussam, forms the centre of the region, and it is hemmed in by a handful of smaller divisions: the Bamboutos department, headquartered at Mbouda, the Hauts-Plateaux (High Plateaus) department, governed from Baham, and the Koung-Khi department, governed from Bandjoun. These latter two divisions were recently formed due to population booms in the area. Traditional political organisation Traditional rulers still hold substantial power in the province. A sultan, whose palace and head of government are in Foumban, rules the Bamum. Bamum tradition claims an unbroken line of succession since 1394. The Bamileke, in contrast, are divided into over 100 groups, each headed by a chief (fon, foyn, or fo). The chiefs are themselves divided into various ranks, with major rulers living in Bandjoun, Bafang, Bangangt√©, Dschang, and Mbouda. Traditionally, chiefs command divine powers and own all lands by divine mandate. Individual tenants work plots at their chief's behest. These groupings thus form the basis for Bamileke tribal identity. Advisers, often called the ‚ÄúCouncil of Notables‚Äù, in turn serve the chiefs. Below them are various district chiefs who govern individual wards in the village. =Education= With nearly 1,000 schools serving its some 1,000 villages, the West relatively well provisioned educationally. The high population density contributes to classroom overcrowding, however. Students must often travel to nearby towns in order to pursue higher levels of education, since most villages do not have secondary schools. The province is also the location of a bilingual university at Dschang as well as the private Universit√© des Montagnes in Bangangt√©. =Health= Hospitals and health clinics are fairly prevalent in the region. The area's pleasant climate keeps it largely mosquito-free, so malaria is not a problem as in much of the rest of Cameroon. Lack of sanitation is a serious issue, as this leads to outbreaks of dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and other ailments, especially in the more urbanised centres. =Cultural life= The West has a lively traditional culture. The Bamum observe traditional Muslim holy days, such as Ramadan and the Feast of the Ram. They also hold an annual cultural festival called the Ngouon. Bamileke festivals vary from tribe to tribe, and most are held during the dry season or for special events such as funerals or the birth of twins. Some examples are the Macabo Festival of Bangoua, the Medumba Festival of Bangangt√©, and the Ben Skin Dance, a dance of female sensuality that has grown increasingly commercialised. A number of museums celebrate the West's history and traditions. Among these are the Mus√©e du Palais du Sultan Bamun, the Mus√©e des Arts et des Traditions Bamoun, and the Mus√©e Sacr√© Djiss√©, all in Foumban. The Mus√©e de la Chefferie Bandjoun is the region's largest repository of Bamileke artifacts. History =Early population movements= Human beings have inhabited the West since prehistoric times, as evidenced by archaeological finds at Galima and Foumban. Bamileke groups likely entered the area from the Adamawa Plateau in the 17th century, probably fleeing Fulbe (Fula) slave raids. They originally settled in what is now Bamum territory, but the Bamum forced them across the Noun in a series of wars in the 18th century. Bamileke tradition states that they migrated in three major groups. The first consisted of the Baleng, Bapi, and Bafussam (who founded the settlement at Bafoussam along with the Bamougoum). Next came the Bagam, Bamendu, Bamsoa, Bazu, and Bangu. The final wave consisted of the Bati and Bafangwa. This period also saw the Bamileke assimilation of several older populations. Bamum tradition claims their kingdom was founded when Nchar√© Yen led them to settle at Foumban (Mfom-Ben) in the 15th century. However, most scholars today place this migration as late as the 19th century, likely the result of population pressures caused by the same Fulbe jihads that had earlier pushed the Bamileke south. The king Mbwe-Mbwe extended Bamum holdings from the Mbam to the Noun Rivers, subjugating numerous local rulers in the process. Mbwe-Mbwe also kept the Fulbe from encroaching further south and west. The Bamum experienced a golden age of sorts under the leadership of Sultan Ibrahim Njoya (r. 1886-1933). Njoya was a patron of learning, and he converted to Islam under the tutelage of numerous Muslim scholars he had allowed into the kingdom. He developed an alphabet for the Bamum language (the Shumon script), and established schools to teach it. The Islamisation of the Bamum occurred during his reign. The Bali-Chamba are the third major group to have pushed through the West Province territory in historical times. They came under the leadership of a warrior chief named Gawolbe and crossed the Noun around 1825. In 1830, they fought a war with the Bamileke Bafu-Fundong group near Dschang. Their leader, Gawolbe II died, and the tribe splintered as Gawolbe's seven sons fought for control. Most of these groups migrated further west into what is today the Northwest Province. =European contacts= Ibrahim Njoya ordered the construction of the Bamum sultan's palace at Foumban. =German administration= The area had only indirect contact with European powers (mostly due to slave raids by tribes further south) before the German annexation of the Cameroons in 1884. The first Europeans to enter the territory were representatives of the Basel Mission in 1897. The Germans themselves did not move into the territory until 1899 (though they had signed treaties with Bamileke leaders as early as 1884). Governor Jesko Von Puttkamer established the Gesellschaft Nordwest-Kamerun to monopolise trade in the area, and he established the divisional capital at Dschang in 1903. The area's cool temperatures drew many German settlers, and the colonisers established great coffee plantations, which they forced the natives to work. Larger plantations were established further south, and many Bamileke were forced or encouraged to move out of their traditional territories to work them. The Germans also set up a puppet over-chief for all the Bamileke, who had never before considered themselves a single group. Catholic missionaries reached the grasslands area in 1910. By 1912, most of the Bamileke had converted to Christianity. Sultan Njoya welcomed the first German emissary to the Bamum kingdom in 1902 after hearing of the ruthless treatment given rebellious tribes further to the northwest. He even lent military support for the German campaign against the Nso near Bamenda in 1906. The Bamum soldiers, eager for revenge for an earlier defeat to the Nso in 1888, committed such atrocities that the Germans sent them back. Njoya also ordered the building of a palace at Foumban in 1917, which he modeled after that of the German governor. =French administration= Bamileke and Bamum territory fell to the French in 1916 after the Germans' defeat in World War I. The territory became part of the Bar√©-Foumban-Nkongsamba administrative area, and the capital was moved to Foumban. Dschang served as the seat of a French-run school for the sons of chiefs, which the French used to indoctrinate as well as instruct. The French maintained German plantations and labour sources, and new operations sprung up, such as a palm plantation at Dschang. The new colonial overlords made improvements to the region's infrastructure, as well, especially to the road network. The French continued Germany's policy of propping up sympathetic chiefs and deposing recalcitrant ones. They sought some sort of administrative centre amid the Bamileke domains, and in 1926, Fotso II of the Bandjoun people offered the site of Bafoussam, neighbouring his domains but not actually part of them. Mambou, chief of the area, opposed the colonials, but he was defeated, and the foundations of modern Bafoussam were laid. The Bamum did not escape the French sphere, either, as sultan Ibrahim Njoya was deposed in 1931 due to his pro-German views. Njoya died in a Yaound√© prison two years later. After World War II, the West was a centre of political pressure and protest against colonial rule. Other groups came into being to combat these (usually with France's blessing), including the Union Bamil√©k√© in 1948. In 1956, France granted self-rule to its colony, and the West proved one of Cameroon's more politically influential areas due to groups such as Paysans Independants and the Assembl√©e Traditionnale Bamoun. The population boomed between 1958 and 1965, a period of high urbanisation in Cameroon. In 1958, Ahmadou Ahidjo became prime minister of French Cameroon with a pro-independence platform. The powerful Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) party, including many Bamileke, opposed him as a French puppet. On 27 June 1959, several Bamileke areas were struck in what were later labeled terrorist strikes. Ahidjo declared martial law. His later attitudes toward the Bamileke likely were strongly influenced by these incidents. =Post-independence= Under Ahidjo, the current West Province was known as the Administrative Inspectorate of the West. He named Bafoussam the capital and set the province's current boundaries after union of British and French Cameroon in 1972. Ahidjo's battles with the UPC continued past Cameroon's independence on 1 January 1960. He outlawed the party's \\"terrorist\\" wing on 30 October 1963, leading to more strikes in Bamileke population centres and subsequent military retribution. What support Ahidjo did enjoy among the Bamileke largely came from his pro-business policies. When the president resigned in 1982, his replacement, Paul Biya, sent his representative, Moussa Yaya, to reassure the West's businessmen that he would not prove unfriendly to their interests. Yaya mistrusted Biya, however, and only exacerbated Bamileke reservations. The Bamum, as well, were reluctant to see Cameroon's presidency change from a Muslim to a Christian. Much Bamileke and Bamum resentment for the Biya administration dates to this period. In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, Paul Biya, signed decrees abolishing \\"Provinces\\" and replacing them with \\"Regions\\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions.

An article featuring actor Robert Patrick, current charterholder of Boozefighters MC Chapter 101, describes the club as \\"a nonprofit organization that raises money to help vets, children and the poor\\". The Boozefighter Motorcycle Club was formed by veterans of World War II. \\"Wino\\" Willie Forkner is recognized as the founder. They were at the infamous Hollister, California event of July 4, 1947 which has been immortalized by the movie \\"The Wild One,\\" starring Marlon Brando. Lee Marvin played the part of \\"Chino\\", based on \\"Wino\\" Willie Forkner. California racing culture gave rise to a special kind of motorcycle engine, the \\"stroker\\". According to historians, it originated in the So Cal Racing circuit, shortly after the introduction of the Harley Davidson knucklehead. \\"Sitting around on a Saturday, at the bike shop, guys even from different clubs drinking beer together. CB Clauson, a Boozefighter was eyeing a scooter. He walked over and looked at it very calculatingly. CB picked up a piston from that scooter, walked over to another scooter, and looked at the cylinders. He then started to take measurements. No one had any idea what he was up to. This was when he had the idea that if he interchanged the pistons he could make a 'stroker' motor - which he did and the stroker was born. The Boozefighters have chapters worldwide including the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, Korea and the Philippines but claim no territory, only history. To become a prospect, candidates must have an American or World War II allied motorcycle and the sponsorship of a full patched member. After a potential member is invited to ride and party with the club, he is deemed a ‚Äúhangaround‚Äù, indicating that the individual is invited to club events and can associate with members. If a hangaround is deemed appropriate and finds sponsorship he may be invited to join the club as prospect and don the bottom single rocker of a full patch member in training. The term full patch refers to the top and bottom rockers in combination with the Boozefighter center patch, ‚Äúthe bottle‚Äù and the MC cubes. To make the transition to a full patch member, the prospect must be voted on unanimously by the chapter. It is the duty of every prospect to support his club to the fullest and make himself known to the chapter as a member of good character. Even after a member is given his patches, the patches themselves remain the property of BFMC and, if the member departs, the patches must be returned.

She is ·º†œÅŒπŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµŒπŒ± ('early-born', 'born in the morning') in the Iliad, and the Rigveda describes U·π£as, the daughter of Dy√°u·π£, as being born from the harnessing of the A≈õvins, the divine horse twins driving the chariot of the sun. = Colours = A characteristic generally given to the dawn h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs is her 'brilliance' and she is generally described as a 'bringer of light'. Various cognates associated with the dawn-goddess indeed derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *b ∞eh‚ÇÇ-, meaning 'to glow, shine'. The Vedic U·π£as is described as bhƒÅnty Us√°sah ('the Dawns shine'), the Avestan U≈°√• as u≈°i ... bƒÅmya ('shining dawn') and the Greek ƒí·πìs as œÜŒ±ŒπŒΩœåŒªŒπœÇ ('light-bringing'), or ŒªŒ±ŒºœÄœÅŒø-œÜŒ±ŒÆœÇ ('light beam[ing]'), attested in an Orphic hymn to the Dawn. h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs is usually associated with the natural colours of the dawn: gold, saffron-yellow, red or crimson. The Dawn is 'gold-coloured' (h√≠ra·πáya-var·πáƒÅ) in the Rigveda, 'the golden-yellow one' (flƒÅua) in Ovid's Amores, and 'gold- throned' (khrys√≥thronos; œáœÅœÖœÉœåŒ∏œÅŒøŒΩŒøœÇ) in a Homeric formula. In Latvian folk songs, Saulƒó and her daughter(s) are dressed of shawls woven with gold thread, and Saulƒó wears shoes of gold, which parallels Sappho describing ƒí·πìs as 'golden-sandalled' (khrysop√©dillos; œáœÅœÖœÉŒøœÄŒ≠Œ¥ŒπŒªŒªŒøœÇ). ƒí·πìs is also 'saffron- robed' (Œ∫œÅŒøŒ∫œåœÄŒµœÄŒªŒøœÇ) in Homeric poems, while U·π£√°s is described as a red dawn shining from afar; 'red, like a mare', she shoots 'ruddy beams of light', 'yokes red steeds to her car' or 'harnesses the red cows' in the Samaveda. Saffron-yellow, red and purple are colours also associated with the Dawn by the Latin poet Ovid. The Baltic Sun-goddess Saulƒó has preserved some of the imagery of h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs, and she is sometimes portrayed as waking up 'red' (sƒÅrta) or 'in a red tree' during the morning. Saul√© is also described as being dressed in clothes woven with \\"threads of red, gold, silver and white\\".Andrews, Tamra. Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky. Oxford University Press. 1998. p. 169. According to Russian folklorist Alexander Afanasyev, the figure of the Dawn in Slavic tradition is varied: she is described in a Serbian folksong as a maiden sitting on a silver throne in the water, her legs of a yellow color and her arms of gold;–ê—Ñ–∞–Ω–∞—Å—å–µ–≤, –ê.–ù. –ü–æ—ç—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ–∑–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—É: –û–ø—ã—Ç —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ –≤–µ—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –º–∏—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö —Ä–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤. –¢–æ–º 1.

Moskva: Izd. K. Soldatenkova 1865. pp. 223-224. (In Russian) = Movements = h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs is also frequently described as dancing: U·π£as throws on embroidered garments 'like a dancer' (n·πõt≈´r iva), ƒí·πìs has 'dancing-places' (œáŒøœÅŒøŒØ) around her house in the East, Saulƒó is portrayed dancing in her gilded shoes on a silver hill, and her fellow Baltic goddess Au≈°rinƒó is said to dance on a stone for the people on the first day of summer. According to a Bulgarian tradition, on St. John's Day, the sun dances and \\"whirls swords about\\" (sends rays of light), whereas in Lithuania the Sun (identified as female) rides a car towards her husband, the Moon, \\"dancing and emitting fiery sparks\\" on the way.Ralston, William Ralston Shedden. The songs of the Russian people, as illustrative of Slavonic mythology and Russian social life. London: Ellis & Green. 1872. p. 242. The spread hand as the image of the sun's rays in the morning may also be of Proto-Indo-European origin. The Homeric expressions 'rose-armed' (rhod√≥pƒìkhus; ·ø•ŒøŒ¥œåœÄŒ∑œáœÖœÇ) and 'rosy- fingered Dawn' (rhodod√°ktylos ƒí·πìs; ·ø•ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒ¥Œ¨Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ ·º®œéœÇ), as well as Bacchylides' formula 'gold-armed' (khrysopakh√∫s; œáœÅœÖœÉŒøœÄŒ±œáœçœÇ), can be semantically compared with the Vedic formulas 'golden-handed' (h√≠ra·πáyapƒÅ·πái-; ‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§™‡§æ‡§£‡§ø) and 'broad- handed' (p·πõth√∫pƒÅ·πái-; ‡§™‡•É‡§•‡•Å‡§™‡§æ‡§£‡§ø). They are also similar with Latvian poetic songs where the Sun-god's fingers are said to be 'covered with golden rings'. According to Martin L. West, \\"the 'rose' part is probably a Greek refinement.\\" = Dwelling = Another common trait of the Dawn goddess is her dwelling, situated on an island in the Ocean or in an Eastern house. In Greek mythology, ƒí·πìs is described as living 'beyond the streams of Okeanos at the ends of the earth'. In Slavic folklore, the home of the Zoryas was sometimes said to be on Bouyan (or Buyan), an oceanic island paradise where the Sun dwelt along with his attendants, the North, West and East winds. The Avesta refers to a mythical eastern mountain called U≈°idam- ('Dawn-house'). In a myth from Lithuania, a man named Joseph becomes fascinated with Au≈°rinƒó appearing in the sky and goes on a quest to find the 'second sun', who is actually a maiden that lives on an island in the sea and has the same hair as the Sun. In the Baltic folklore, Saulƒó is said to live in a silver-gated castle at the end of the sea, or to go to an island in the middle of the sea for her nocturnal rest. = Vehicle = The Dawn is often described as driving some sort of vehicle, probably originally a wagon or a similar carrier, certainly not a chariot as the technology appeared later within the Sintashta culture (2100‚Äì1800), generally associated with the Indo-Iranian peoples. In the Odyssey, ƒí·πìs appears once as a charioteer, and the Vedic U·π£as yokes red oxen or cows, probably pictorial metaphors for the red clouds or rays seen at morning light. The vehicle is portrayed as a biga or a rosy-red quadriga in Virgil's Aeneid and in classical references from Greek epic poetry and vase painting, or as a shining chariot drawn by golden-red horses. Saulƒó, a sun- goddess syncrethized with the Dawn, also drives a carriage with copper-wheels, a \\"gleaming copper chariot\\"Dixon-Kennedy, Mike (1998). Encyclopedia of Russian and Slavic myth and legend. p. 252. ABC-CLIO. . or a golden chariotAndrews, Tamra. Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky. Oxford University Press. 1998. p. 20. pulled by untiring horses, or a 'pretty little sleigh' (kama≈Üi≈Üa) made of fish-bones. Saulƒó is also described as driving her shining car on the way to her husband, the Moon. In other accounts, she is said to sail the seas on a golden boat, which, according to legend, is what her chariot transforms into for her night travels.Strai≈æys, Vytautas; Klimka, Libertas. \\"The Cosmology of the Ancient Balts\\".

In: Tautosakos darbai t. 54, p. 13-25. . In a Croatian fairy tale (Fisherman Plunk and his Wife), the Dawn-Maiden (Zora-djevojka) arrives from the sea in a silver boat with golden oars, and sails back to Buyan, the mysterious island where she dwells.Brlic-Mazuranic, Ivana. Croatian tales of long ago. Translated by Fanny S. Copeland. New York: Frederick A. Stokes Co.. 1922. pp. 58 and 256.  Horses  In regards to the imagery of the Dawn driving her chariot, her horses are also mentioned in Indo-European poetical tradition. Homer's Odyssey describes ƒí·πìs's horses as a pair of swift steeds named Lampos and Phaethon, and Bacchylides calls her 'white-horsed Dawn' (ŒªŒµœçŒ∫ŒπœÄœÄŒøœÇ ·ºàœéœÇ). The vehicle is sometimes portrayed as being drawn by golden-red horses. The colours of Dawn's horses are said to be \\"pale red, ruddy, yellowish, reddish-yellow\\" in the Vedic tradition. Baltic sun-goddess Saulƒó's horses are said to be of a white color; in other accounts they amount to three steeds of golden, silver and diamond colors. In Latvian dainas (folk songs), her horses are described as yellow, of a golden or a fiery color. The sun's steeds are also portrayed as having hooves and bridles of gold in the dainas, and as golden beings themselves or of a bay colour, \\"reflect[ing] the hues of the bright or the twilight sky\\".Chase, George Davis. \\"Sun Myths in Lithuanian Folksongs\\". In: Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 31 (1900): 198-199. doi:10.2307/282647.  Role  = Opener of the doors of Heaven = h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs is also depicted as the opener of the doors or gates of Heaven: the Baltic verse pie Dievi≈Üa namdurƒìm ('by the doors of the house of God'), which Saulƒó is urged to open to the horses of the Son(s) of God, is lexically comparable with the Vedic expression dvƒÅÃÅrau ... Div√°·∏• ('doors of Heaven'), which U·π£as opens with her light. Another parallel could be made with the 'shining doors' (Œ∏œçœÅŒ±œÇ ... œÜŒ±ŒµŒπŒΩŒ¨œÇ) of the home of ƒí·πìs, behind which she locks up her lover Tithonus as he grows old and withers in Homer's Hymn to Aphrodite. A similar poetic imagery is present among Classical poets, although some earlier Greek source may lie behind these. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Aur≈çra opens the red doors (purpureas fores) to fill her rosy halls, and in Nonnus' Dionysiaca the Dawn-goddess shakes off her sleep and leaves Kephalos' repose in order to 'open the gates of sunrise' (·ºÄŒΩœÑŒøŒªŒØŒ∑œÇ ·Ω§ŒπŒæŒµ Œ∏œçœÅŒ±œÇ œÄŒøŒªŒµŒºŒ∑œÑœåŒ∫ŒøœÇ ·º®œéœÇ).Nonnus. Dionysiaca. 27: 1-3 Other reflexes may also be present in other Indo-European traditions. In Slavic folklore, the goddess of the dawn Zorya Utrennyaya open the palace's gates for her father Da≈æbog's (a Slavic Sun god) journey during the day. Her sister Zorya Vechernyaya, the goddess of dusk, closes them at the end of the day. In a passage of the Eddas about Dellingr, a Norse deity of light, a dwarf utters a charm or incantation in front of 'Delling's doors' (fyr Dellings durum), which apparently means \\"at dawn\\". = Bringer of Light = In Indo-European myths, h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs is either depicted as a reluctant bringer of light for which she is punished, or as a victim saved by her brothers the Divine Twins from a watery peril in the eastern sea. This theme is widespread in the attested traditions: ƒí·πìs and Aur≈çra are sometimes unwilling to leave her bed, U·π£as is punished by Indra for attempting to forestall the day, and Auseklis did not always rise in the morning, as she was said to be locked up in a golden chamber or in Germany sewing velvet skirts.''''

(in Brazilian Portuguese) Kashubians (Poland) were to worship Jastrzebog and the goddess Jastra, who was worshiped in Jastarnia, from which the Kashubian term for Easter, Jastr√´, was derived. These names may be related with Polabian god Jutrobog, be influenced by Proto- Germanic *Austr≈çn, or come from the word jasny (\\"bright\\"). = Epithets = The formulaic expression \\"Daughter of Dyƒìus\\" is attested as an epithet attached to a dawn-goddess in several poetic traditions: * PIE: *diw√≥s d ∞u«µh‚Çêt·∏ór, \\"Daughter of Dyƒìus\\", **Vedic: duhitƒÅÃÅr-div√°h, \\"Daughter of Heaven\\", epithet of U·π£as,'''' ** Greek: thug√°tƒìr Di√≥s, \\"Daughter of Zeus\\", probably a pre-Homeric Greek epithet of ƒí·πìs,'''' ** Lithuanian: dievo dukrytƒó, \\"Daughter of Dievas\\", epithet of the Sun-goddess which likely took the attributes of h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs.'''' The Sanskrit epithet dyotan√° (\\"The Light Bearer\\") is also used once in reference to Ushas in the Rigveda. = Poetic and liturgic formula = An expression of formulaic poetry can be found in the Proto-Indo-European expression *h‚ÇÇ(e)ws-s·∏±eti (\\"it dawns\\"), attested in Lithuanian au≈°ta, Avestan usaitƒ´, or Sanskrit ucchƒÅti.' The poetic formula 'the lighting dawn' is also attested in the Indo-Iranian tradition: Sanskrit uchantƒ´m us√°sam, and Young Avestan usaitƒ´m u·π£ÃåƒÅÃä≈ãh…ôm. ‚Äì See entry vas- [2]. Other remnants of the root *h‚ÇÇ√©ws≈çs are present in the Zoroastrian prayer to the dawn HoshbƒÅm, and in U≈°ahin gƒÅh (the dawn watch), sung between midnight and dawn. In Persian historical and sacred literature, the personal name A√ªshb√¢m also appears in the Chapter XXXI of the Bundahishn, translated as \\"the dawn\\".West, E. W. Pahlavi Texts. Part 1. Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 5. 1880. p. 139 A special carol, zorile (\\"dawn\\"), was sung by the colindƒÉtori (traditional Romanian singers) during funerals, imploring the Dawns not be in a hurry to break, or begging them to prevent the dead from departing this world. The word is of Slavic origin, with the term for 'dawn' attached to the Romanian article -le.  Legacy  According to linguist V√°clav Bla≈æek, the Albanian word (h)yll (\\"star\\") finds a probable etymology in the root *h‚ÇÇews- ('dawn'), perhaps specifically in *h‚ÇÇws-li ('morning-star'). Scholars have also argued that the Roman ethnonym Aurƒìlius (originally Ausƒìlius, from Sabine *ausƒìla 'sun') and the Etruscan sun god Usil (probably of Osco-Umbrian origin) may be related to the Indo-European word for the dawn. = Influences = The Japanese goddess of the dawn Uzume, revered in Shintoism, was probably influenced by Vedic religion. It has been suggested by anthropologist Kevin Tuite that Georgian goddess Dali also shows several parallels with Indo- European dawn goddesses. A possible mythological descendant of the Indo- European dawn goddess may be Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and lust. Scholars posit similarities based on her connection with a sky deity as her father (Zeus or Uranus) and her association with red and gold colours. In the Iliad, Aphrodite is hurt by a mortal and seeks solace in her mother's (Dione) bosom. Dione is seen as a female counterpart to Zeus and is thought to etymologically derive from Proto-Indo-European root *Dyeus.

It drains an area of approximately . The total length of the river and its tributary streams is over . Despite urbanization and associated problems with water quality on the lower section of this river, it provides spawning areas for Chinook salmon and rainbow trout. There is a fish ladder on the river at Streetsville. Much of the river can still be travelled by canoe or kayak. The headwaters of the Credit River is home to a native self-sustaining brook trout population and an introduced brown trout population. Credit Valley Conservation, the local watershed management conservation authority, operates several Conservation Areas including Belfountain, Island Lake, and Terra Cotta. Caledon Lake lies in the Headwaters of Credit River Forks of the Credit Provincial Park is located on the upper part of the river between Brampton and Orangeville, and is near the Bruce Trail. Communities in the river's watershed include the following: *City of Brampton *City of Mississauga *Township of Amaranth *Town of Caledon *Township of East Garafraxa *Town of Halton Hills *Town of Mono *Town of Orangeville Naming The river became known as Missinnihe (Eastern Ojibwa: \\"trusting creek\\") to the Mississaugas First Nation who met annually with white traders there. To the First Nations, the river was \\"held in reverential estimation as the favourite resort of their ancestors\\" and the band, which ranged from Long Point on Lake Erie to the Rouge River on Lake Ontario, became known as the Credit River Indians. Their descendants are today the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation. The origins of the English name come from the time when French fur traders supplied goods to the native people in advance (on credit) against furs which would be delivered the following spring. It was known as the Rivi√®re au Cr√©dit. The trading post was set up at the mouth of the river, in Port Credit, in the early 18th century. Watershed population and land use As of the 2006 census, 750,000 people live in the watershed. Of those, 87 percent live in the lower third of the watershed. Population growth is approximately 3 percent per year. In 1999, 21 percent of the watershed was developed. By 2020, 40 percent of the watershed will be developed (based on approved development and the official plans of the municipalities). =Plants and animals= The Credit River is home to a wide range of wildlife. Some species are permanent or seasonal residents while others are sighted occasionally.

Born in 1938 in Quincy, Massachusetts, he was taken by his father to jazz and Boston Symphony Orchestra concerts in the early 1950s, and developed an ear for both genres. His commentaries, originally on WGBH-FM radio and now WCRB for the Boston Symphony are broadcast on Saturday evenings. These broadcasts as well as his commentary at the Sunday Tanglewood Festival in the summertime are informed by his lifelong attendance of the orchestra, dating back to conductors Charles M√ºnch and Erich Leinsdorf. His mother, an educator in the South Shore, gave him a love of learning, a curiosity for many cultures, and until her recent passing, a tie to the last Golden Age of Opera. Della Chiesa enlisted in the Army, and became a trumpeter in the Army band. He was an announcer for WBCN in the 1960s and WGBH-FM radio in the mid-1970s. His first job after graduating from the Boston University College of Communication in 1959 was at WBOS. From the mid-1970s into the early 1980s Della Chiesa was host of Music America, an afternoon program on WGBH-FM which featured the broad range of American jazz and musical theater. He has presented many visiting Broadway and jazz performers, with a special Friday afternoon program of opera. He was also host for the Boston Symphony Friday performances. In 1986, Ron married a chef by the name of Joyce. Ron was 48 and Joyce was 41. He and his wife, Joyce Della Chiesa, now live in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in a 10-room Victorian style house. With the death of Robert J. Lurtsema, he became the host of Classical Morning, but retained his Friday afternoon Boston Symphony spot. He continues to announce a Friday evening jazz program, where his close friends will drop in when they are performing in Boston. He is also heard on WPLM-FM on a Sunday night program highlighting Frank Sinatra. Della Chiesa has been the host of Cooking Around Town on WGBH-TV. In that capacity, he has visited many of the famous and esoteric eateries and bistros in the Boston area, watching the owner/chefs turn their recipes into delicious dishes. His wife, Joyce, is an accomplished chef de cuisine. Della Chiesa is in demand as a narrator for New England orchestras and social functions. He occasionally hosts learning tours and lectures for opera, both on land, and on cruise ships; most notably, the Queen Mary 2.

The park's name is derived from a Cherokee language word meaning \\"tumbling waters\\". The park is home to Amicalola Falls, a waterfall that is the highest in Georgia.Boyd (2001), p. 82 However, an analysis conducted by the World Waterfall Data base suggests that the main part of the falls is in height, followed by a prolonged gently sloping run in which the flow drops another . It is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. An trail that winds past Amicalola Falls and leads to Springer Mountain, famous as the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, begins in the park. Amicalola Falls State Park also offers many hiking trails, a guest lodge, restaurant, cabins, a shelter for long- distance Appalachian Trail hikers, a campground, and access to the eco- friendly Len Foote Hike Inn. History View from the Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge Little was known by European Americans about the falls before the 19th century. Until 1832, the Cherokee, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe believed to have migrated in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, controlled a large territory that included this area of the state park. That year they signed the Treaty of New Echota with the United States, which forced the Cherokee to remove into the Ozarks in Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. They called their mass removal and overland journey the Trail of Tears, during which many people died of the thousands traveling. Nearby settlers knew a Cherokee woman who lived in the area until the 1850s; she refused to leave when her tribe was removed.Amicalola Falls, Gateway to the Appalachian Trail, retrieved on 2007-03-20 The first written account of the falls was by William Williamson, who was exploring the area seeking land to claim in the Sixth Georgia Land Lottery. Williamson wrote: An unknown settler was given this land after the lottery. He decided not to live on it because the terrain proved to be too rugged. The state purchased the falls in 1911. Amicalola Falls State Park was not developed at all until the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club decided in 1958 that they would move the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail from Mount Oglethorpe to the nearby Springer Mountain. An trail was blazed from the base of Amicalola Falls to the top of Springer Mountain, so that Appalachian Trail hikers would be able to access the trail from a major highway. Today View from the top of the falls Amicalola Falls State Park & Lodge has four groups of trails within it, including the trail leading up to the top of the waterfall. The park has a lodge that serves as a starting point of Appalachian Trail hikers. The park also checks in guests for a nearby facility called the Len Foote Hike Inn, a backcountry eco-friendly inn that is 5 miles from the park, one mile from the Appalachian Approach trail and 4.4 miles from Springer Mountain. In 2012, Amicalola Falls State Park was privatized and its operations transferred to Coral Hospitality, a Florida- based hotel and resort management company.

Historic site A group of items or structures of historic significance at, or close to, the base have been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 40), following a proposal by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. These comprise a bust of General San Martin, a grotto with a statue of the Virgin of Lujan, a flagpole erected in 1955, and a cemetery with a stele commemorating Argentine expedition members who died in the area.  General Mart√≠n G√ºemes Refuge  Refuge General Mart√≠n G√ºemes is the name given to two shelters in Antarctica. The first one is covered by ice, the second one is active. The refuge is Administered by the Argentine Army and depends on Esperanza Base, which is responsible for maintenance and care. The two refuges are located on the Tabarin Peninsula on the eastern tip of the Trinity Peninsula on the Antarctic Peninsula south of Esperanza.The refuges pay homage to Mart√≠n Miguel de G√ºemes, a military man who served an outstanding role in the Argentine war of independence. = General Mart√≠n G√ºemes I Refuge = The first refuge was located on the north east coast of the Duse Bay of the Trinity Peninsula and opened on October 23, 1953. , at that time head of the newly created Esperanza Base, participated in its construction, being one of the first refuges installed by the Army and the second in the continental Antarctica.

It is located four kilometres southeast of the city centre. Remuera is characterised by many large houses, often Edwardian or mid 20th century. A prime example of a \\"leafy\\" suburb, Remuera is noted for its quiet tree lined streets. The suburb has numerous green spaces, most obvious of which is ≈åhinerau / Mount Hobson ‚Äì a volcanic cone with views from the top overlooking WaitematƒÅ Harbour and Rangitoto. The suburb extends from Hobson Bay and the Orakei Basin on the WaitematƒÅ Harbour to the north and east, to the main thoroughfare of State Highway 1 in the southwest. It is surrounded by the suburbs of Orakei, Meadowbank, Saint Johns, Mount Wellington, Ellerslie, Greenlane, Epsom, Newmarket and Parnell. Remuera is home to many well-known New Zealanders, including the late Sir Edmund Hillary and the race car driver Bruce McLaren. Retrieved 15 October 2013. History Remuera has had a long history of human occupation, starting back in the early 13th century when MƒÅori came to the area. Retrieved 10 February 2013. The area was very attractive to Maori as much of the Auckland isthmus was devoid of trees and covered only in native flax, bracken and scrub. Remuera was different, having patches of woodland which were the habitat of many birds suitable for trapping while the adjacent harbour and basins were good fishing areas. John Logan Campbell describes early 19th century Remuera in his book Poenamo: The suburb is named after a (fortification) named , on ≈åhinerau / Mount Hobson. Retrieved 2013-30-09. Remu-wera literally translates to \\"burnt edge of kilt\\", commemorating the occasion where a chieftainess of Hauraki was allegedly captured and consumed.The Reed Dictionary of New Zealand Place Names, Reed Books, 2002 Although the most common definition in reference literature, the accuracy of this definition has been described as \\"highly doubtful\\".The AA Concise Dictionary of New Zealand Place Names, Moa Beckett Publishers Limited, 1994 Around 1741, Te Wai-o-Hua iwi was driven away by the NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua and Te Tao≈´ iwi. Later, these iwi merged with Te Roroa and Te Uri-o-Hau into NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua- o-≈årƒÅkei, which is the main iwi on the TƒÅmaki isthmus. Retrieved 10 January 2013. In May 1844 one of the largest MƒÅori feasts ever held in New Zealand took place in Remuera. It was organised by the Waikato iwi and about 4000 MƒÅori and many PƒÅkehƒÅ (Europeans) were present. The festivities lasted for a week and large amounts of food and drinks were served: 11,000 baskets of potatoes, 9,000 sharks, 100 pigs, and large amounts of tea, tobacco and sugar. Governor Robert FitzRoy visited the festivities on 11 May 1844 when a haka was performed by 1,600 MƒÅori, armed with guns and tomahawks. Retrieved 10 July 2013. When the European settlers wanted to buy the land on the TƒÅmaki isthmus from the MƒÅori, they first declined. But in 1851, Henry Tacy Kemp, an interpreter to the Land Claims Commissioners, bought 700 acres for ¬£5000. Subsequently, more plots of land were sold and put up for public auction. The land was suitable for pasture land and as the town of Auckland was some distance away people did not really start to build houses (as opposed to farmhouses) until the 1860s. The ideal location included a view of the harbour. Many of the large villas stood on quite big properties, as their owners needed pasturing for carriage and riding horses and enjoyed creating landscape gardens. Some even had secondary houses for gardeners or estate managers. Many of these early houses still stand, surrounded now by later suburban developments or converted into institutions such as schools. Smaller suburban houses began appearing in the area nearest Newmarket and began to spread along Remuera Road. The first shops opened in 1890 at the intersection with Victoria Avenue. Railway stations at Newmarket and Market Road encouraged residents to commute to town. Likewise one of the most important routes for the electric tram system created in 1902 was to the Remuera shops, with an extension to the bottom of Victoria Avenue. View from ≈åhinerau / Mount Hobson across Remuera to Hobson Bay One of the first businesses was L.J. Keys‚Äô grocery store on the Clonbern Rd corner, which currently houses a caf√©. Retrieved 10 January 2013. Nowadays, Remuera's main business and shopping area stretches along Remuera Road from Armadale Road to St Vincent's Avenue. Smaller shopping areas are situated at Upland Road and Benson Road. In 1915 Remuera was amalgamated into Auckland City. Up until that point it had been governed by the Remuera Road Board which had opposed joining Auckland in the face of campaigning by the Remuera Ratepayers Association. This included a petition in 1912 in which 791 of the ratepayers (over 50%) signed to join with the adjacent Auckland City. A commission of inquiry was appointed, which recommended amalgamation. Again the Road Board declined and it was only after the Department of Internal Affairs intervened that the Road Board gave in. The union was ratified in February 1915 and the 2,520 acres of Remuera became part of Auckland. J.Dempsey said that Auckland had received \\"the brightest jewel in her crown today\\", although a subsequent report by the city engineer pointed out that Remuera had not been surveyed, it had 60 miles of primitive roading, and lacked proper stormwater drainage, sewerage and other services. Auckland City Council embarked on a series of improvements for the new area. One of its first acts was to provide a free public library for the area in 1915, later replaced by the current building in 1926. In 1919 however local residents were incensed by the council's building of public toilets at the Remuera shops that they demanded be torn down. The first mile of Remuera Road was concreted in 1921, and the existing tram line was doubled in 1924, followed by an extension of the service to Meadowbank. In more recent history, the infamous Bassett Road machine gun murders took place in Remuera on 7 December 1963. Two men were shot with a .45 calibre Reising submachine gun at 115 Bassett Road and word quickly spread about a \\"Chicago-style\\" gang murder. Two suspects were sentenced to life imprisonment.

This overlooks a field of jonquils and daffodils which bloom in winter or early spring. Waiatarua Reserve / Saint Johns. To the south of Remuera Road lies Waiatarua Reserve. This is a natural basin, prone to seasonal flooding. On several 19th century maps this was shown as a lake and referred to as 'Lake Remuera', 'Lake St John' or 'Lake Waiatarua' although in reality it was largely an area of swampy ground in which a sheet of shallow water would appear sporadically in the wet season.

Connections Remuera's reputation as a desirable residential area around the turn of the 20th century was reflected in the use of its name for a luxury liner. SS Remuera was a steamship launched in 1911. She was the last delivered of three 11000 tonners built by the William Denny Organization between 1909 and 1911 for the New Zealand Shipping Company (sister ships Ruahine and Rotorua). Her inaugural voyage in 1911 was from London to Wellington. In September 1914 she was the first British ship to pass through the newly complete Panama Canal. During the First War she was commandeered by the British Government. After the war she returned to the UK to New Zealand route, as a sign of the changing times she was now refitted to accommodate two classes of passengers as opposed to her initial layout of First, Second and Steerage. Again commandeered at the outbreak of war in 1939 she was torpedoed in the North Sea in September 1940.

Early life The son of Lloyd Lester Stoner and Billie Morrison, Stoner attended high school in Long Beach and upon graduation worked for the Vega Aircraft Company installing armament. During World War II, he enlisted for Aviation Ordnance in the U.S. Marine Corps and served in the South Pacific and northern China. Engineer In late 1945 Stoner began working in the machine shop for Whittaker, an aircraft equipment company, and ultimately became a Design Engineer. In 1954 he came to work as chief engineer for ArmaLite, a division of Fairchild Engine & Airplane Corporation. While at ArmaLite, he designed a series of prototype small arms, including the AR-3, AR-9, AR-11, AR-12, none of which saw significant production. Their only real success during this period was the AR-5 survival rifle, which was adopted by the United States Air Force. ArmaLite AR-10 In 1955, Stoner completed initial design work on the revolutionary ArmaLite AR-10, a lightweight (7.25 lbs.) select-fire infantry rifle in 7.62√ó51mm NATO caliber. The AR-10 was submitted for rifle evaluation trials to the US Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground late in 1956. In comparison with competing rifle designs previously submitted for evaluation, the AR-10 was smaller, easier to fire in automatic, and much lighter. However it arrived very late in the testing cycle, and the army rejected the AR-10 in favor of the more conventional T44, which became the M14. The AR-10's design was later licensed to the Dutch firm of Artillerie Inrichtingen, who produced the AR-10 until 1960 for sale to various military forces. ArmaLite AR-15 M16A1 rifle At the request of the U.S. military, Stoner's chief assistant, Robert Fremont along with Jim Sullivan designed the Armalite AR-15 from the basic AR-10 model, scaling it down to fire the small-caliber .223 Remington cartridge, slightly enlarged to meet the minimum Army penetration requirements. The AR-15 was later adopted by United States military forces as the M16 rifle. After ArmaLite sold the rights to the AR-15 to the Colt Firearms Company, Stoner turned his attention to the AR-16 design. This was another advanced 7.62 mm rifle but used a more conventional piston and a number of stamped parts to reduce cost. This weapon saw only prototype development but adaptation to .223 resulted in the somewhat successful and often imitated Armalite AR-18. Stoner 63 rifle Stoner left ArmaLite in 1961 to serve as a consultant for Colt. He eventually accepted a position with Cadillac Gage where he designed the Stoner 63 Weapons System. This was a modular weapons system which could be reconfigured to be a standard automatic rifle, a light machine gun, a medium machine gun, or a solenoid-fired fixed machine gun. The Stoner Weapons System used a piston-operated gas impingement system. Once again, Robert Fremont and Jim Sullivan took a Stoner rifle and redesigned it for the .223 Remington cartridge, to create the Stoner 63 Weapons System. Stoner then worked with TRW by designing the TRW 6425 25 mm Bushmaster auto cannon, which was later manufactured by Oerlikon as the KBA. He co-founded ARES Incorporated of Port Clinton, Ohio, in 1972, but left the company in 1989, after designing the Ares Light Machine Gun, sometimes known as the Stoner 86. It was an evolved version of the Stoner 63. At Ares, he also designed the Future Assault Rifle Concept (FARC). KAC SR-25 rifle In 1990, he joined Knight's Armament Company (KAC) to create the Stoner Rifle-25 (SR-25), which currently sees military service as the United States Navy Mark 11 Mod 0 Sniper Weapon System. While at KAC, he also worked on yet another version of the Stoner Weapons System, called the Stoner 96. Among his last designs were the SR-50 rifle and the Colt 2000. Mikhail T. Kalashnikov Eugene M. Stoner, left, and Mikhail T. Kalashnikov hold the rifles they designed, taken May 1990. On May 16, 1990, Eugene M. Stoner and Mikhail T. Kalashnikov would meet for the first time. They would spend the next few days talking, sharing stories, shopping, going out to dinner and touring Washington D.C. They visited the Smithsonian Institution, the NRA‚Äôs National Firearms Museum, and a hunting lodge owned by the gun club at Star Tannery, where they went shooting. They would also visit the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, where they watched new weapons being tested. During this short visit both men, intimately familiar with the other's work, shared a common bond and became friends, \\"not needing an interpreter to get their thoughts across.\\" Death Eugene Stoner died as a result of cancer at the age of 74 on April 24, 1997, and was later interred in the Quantico National Cemetery, Quantico, Virginia. He was survived by his wife, Barbara Hitt Stoner, whom he married in 1965; his first wife, Jean Stoner Mahony of Newport Beach, California, from whom he was divorced in 1962; four children from his first marriage, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

They were ambitious, technologically sophisticated, powerful, fast and distinctively streamlined by Raymond Loewy. However, they were also prone to wheelslip both when starting and at speed, complicated to maintain and expensive to run. The PRR decided in 1948 to place diesel locomotives on all express passenger trains, leaving unanswered questions as to whether the T1's flaws were solvable, especially taking into account that the two prototypes did not have the problems inherent to the production unit. An article appearing in a 2008 issue of the Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society Magazine showed that inadequate training for engineers transitioning to the T1 may have led to excessive throttle applications, resulting in driver slippage.\\"In Defense of the 5500s\\", Volume 41, Number 1, Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society Magazine, Spring, 2008 Another root cause of wheelslip was faulty \\"spring equalization\\": The stiffnesses of the springs supporting the locomotive over the axles were not adjusted to properly equalize the wheel-to-track forces. The drivers were equalized together but not equalized with the engine truck. In the production fleet the PRR equalized the engine truck with the front engine and the trailing truck with the rear engine, which helped to solve the wheelslip problem.\\"Pennsy T1 comeback? Ten questions and answers for the T1 Trust\\", Volume 75, Number 5, Trains Magazine, May 2015.  Development  PRR T1 #6110, one of the two prototypes of Class T1. Its streamlined casing was designed by renowned industrial design Raymond Loewy, with details different from the 50 production engines. Before the T1, the last production express passenger engine the PRR had produced was the K4s of 1914, produced until 1928. Two experimental enlarged K5 locomotives were produced in 1929, but they weren't considered enough of an improvement to be worthwhile. After that, the PRR's attention switched to electrification and the production of electric locomotives; apparently, the railroad decided that it did not need more steam locomotives. But the deficiencies of the K4s became more evident during the 1930s. They were fine locomotives, but as train lengths increased they proved to be underpowered; double headed K4s locomotives became the norm on many trains. The railroad had many locomotives available, but paying two crews on two locomotives per train was expensive. Meanwhile, other railroads were leaping ahead, developing increasingly powerful passenger train locomotives. Rival New York Central built 4-6-4 Hudsons, while other roads developed passenger 4-8-2 \\"Mountain\\" type and then 4-8-4 \\"Northern\\" type designs. The PRR's steam power began to look outdated. The PRR began to develop steam locomotives again in the mid-to-late 1930s, but with a difference. Where previous PRR locomotive policy had been conservative, new radical designs took hold. Designers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the PRR's longtime development partner, were eager to prove the viability of steam in the face of new competition from Diesel-electric locomotives. They persuaded the railroad to adopt Baldwin's latest idea: the duplex locomotive. This split the locomotive's driving wheels into two sets, each with its own pair of cylinders and rods. Until then, the only locomotives with two sets of drivers were articulated locomotives, but the duplex used one rigid frame. In a duplex design cylinders could be smaller, and the weight of side and main rods could be drastically reduced. Given that the movement of the main rod could not be fully balanced, the duplex design would reduce the \\"hammer blow\\" on the track. The lower reciprocating mass meant that higher speeds could be achieved. Use of poppet valves also increased the speed because they gave very accurately timed delivery of steam to the cylinders. However, there was a drawback of the metallurgy used; the poppet valve could not withstand the stress of sustained high-speed operation (meaning over on production T1s). The first PRR duplex was the single experimental S1 #6100 of 1939. It was powerful and managed to reach 100.97 miles per hour (162.50 km/h) on level track with 1350 tons passenger stock behind her. Its performance encouraged the PRR continued to develop duplex steam locomotives. The S1 was built unnecessarily large for her exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair until October 1940; therefore its turning radius prohibited it from operating over most of the PRR network. The 6-4-4-6 design reduced driving set traction to the point that it was especially prone to wheel slip; thus only one Class S1 was built. The PRR returned to Baldwin to develop a duplex design fit for series production. The PRR ordered two Baldwin prototypes (#6110 and #6111) at a cost of $600,000 on June 26, 1940. Both prototypes had numerous teething problems and were prone to wheelslip if not handled carefully by the engineer. But favorable test reports resulted in a production order for 50 T1s, split between the PRR's own Altoona Works and Baldwin. On Dec 20, 1944, the PRR Board authorized the purchase of 50 Class T1 locomotives for $14,125,000 ($282,500 per unit). Baldwin's chief designer, Ralph P. Johnson, was responsible for the mechanical aspects of the new T1 class. Designer Raymond Loewy obtained US Patent D 136,260 for an early T1 conceptual design with a high-mounted cab located over the forward driving set. While that suited Baldwin's objective of making the most distinctive steam locomotive possible, practical considerations led the T1 design to be revised to the conventional cab position with a slight modification of the unique nose design included in Loewy's patent. The last production T1 (#5549) entered service on August 27, 1946. The T1 was fitted with the PRR passenger locomotive standard 3 note whistle. Engine #5539 developed , as tested between September 11, 1946 and September 14, 1946 by Chesapeake and Ohio Railway dynamometer car DM-1 while on loan to C&O.; In 1944 #6110, tested on the Stationary Test Plant in Altoona, developed in the cylinders at . Due to their complexity relative to other steam locomotive designs, T1s were known to be difficult to maintain. Recommended to a maximum speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h), T1s were so powerful that they could easily exceed their designed load and speed limitations, which in turn often caused wear and tear issues. A technician charged with determining the cause of frequent poppet valve failures on the T1s claimed to have observed them being operated at speeds of up to 140 mph (225 km/h) to make up time. The T1 was designed to run reliably at speeds of up to . Although such reports are viewed as dubious, some think T1s regularly exceeded 100 mph (161 km/h), making them among the fastest steam locomotives ever built. The price paid for such speed was higher maintenance costs and increased failures in service. The T-1 4-4-4-4 was so powerful that violent wheel slip over a wide speed range could occur if the throttle was not handled carefully by the engineer. Loss of driver traction at high speeds, especially when the T1 was under heavy load while ascending grades, caused damage to the poppet valves. They were described as \\"free steaming,\\" meaning they could maintain boiler pressure regardless of throttle setting. A T1 prototype leaves Chicago's Union Station in February 1943 with the Manhattan Limited to New York.  Fate  Most T1s were degraded to power secondary train when the PRR Board decided to dieselize all first-class prime train in 1948. Some of them were withdrawn from passenger service as early as 1949. All of them were out of service by 1952. All T1 locomotives were sold for scrap between 1951 and late 1955. The last engines were towed westward for scrapping in early 1956. However, an exact scale live steam replica in 1 inch/foot scale (1:12) has been built by Ed Woodings, using the original T1 plans. Not to mention, the T1 has proven a fairly popular subject to be reproduced in model form. A fairly loose computer generated version of a PRR T1 also appeared in the 2004 film Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.  No. 5550  In 2014, a non-profit group known as The T1 Trust is constructing an all-new, fully operational T1 using the original plans with subtle performance improvements where necessary. The T1 Trust's goal is to provide mainline excursion service and to set the world speed record for a steam locomotive currently held by the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard at 126 mph. It is worth mentioning the original T1s were reported to have broken Mallard's speed record as far back as 1948, but these claims have never been officially confirmed. The T1 Trust's cost estimate to build T1 number 5550 is $10 million with an expected completion date of 2030. The construction of 5550 is also following construction and financing methods pioneered by the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado project. The first piece of the locomotive, the keystone shaped number plate, was cast in April 2014, followed by the first minor component, a driving spring link pin, in October 2014. Major components completed as of March 2019 include two Boxpok drivers, the prow, cab, third-course boiler and fire door.

It is located south-east of Central London, and is situated adjacent to the London Borough of Bexley to its west. To its north, across the Thames estuary, is Thurrock in Essex, which can be reached via the Dartford Crossing. The town centre lies in a valley through which the River Darent flows, and where the old road from London to Dover crossed: hence the name, from Darent + ford. Dartford became a market town in medieval times and, although today it is principally a commuter town for Greater London, it has a long history of religious, industrial and cultural importance. It is an important rail hub; the main through-road now by-passes the town itself. Dartford is twinned with Hanau in Germany and Gravelines in France. Geography Bluewater, showing the underlying chalk Dartford lies within the area known as the London Basin. The low-lying marsh to the north of the town consists of London Clay, and the alluvium brought down by the two rivers‚Äîthe Darent and the Cray‚Äîwhose confluence is in this area. The higher land on which the town stands, and through which the narrow Darent valley runs, consists of chalk surmounted by the Blackheath Beds of sand and gravel. As a human settlement, Dartford became established as a river crossing-point with the coming of the Romans; and as a focal point between two routes: that from west to east being part of the main route connecting London with the Continent; and the southerly route following the Darent valley. As a result, the town's main road pattern makes the shape of letter 'T'. The Dartford Marshes to the north, and the proximity of Crayford in the London Borough of Bexley to the west, mean that the town's growth is to the south and east. Wilmington is contiguous with the town to the south; whilst the almost continuous Thames Gateway development means that there is little to show the town boundary in an easterly direction. Within the town boundaries there are several distinct areas: the town centre around the parish church and along the High Street; the Joyce Green area; Temple Hill estate constructed in 1927; the Brent; Fleet Downs; as well as two important areas of open space and several industrial estates. The open spaces are Central Park, alongside the river; and Dartford Heath. =Climate= Like most of the United Kingdom, Dartford has an oceanic climate. History In prehistoric times, the first people appeared in the Dartford area around 250,000 years ago: a tribe of prehistoric hunter-gatherers whose exemplar is called Swanscombe Man. Many other archaeological investigations have revealed a good picture of occupation of the district with important finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. When the Romans engineered the Dover to London road (afterwards named Watling Street), it was necessary to cross the River Darent by ford, giving the settlement its name. Roman villas were built along the Darent Valley, and at Noviomagus (Crayford), close by. The Saxons may have established the first settlement where Dartford now stands. Dartford manor is mentioned in the Domesday Book, compiled in 1086, after the Norman conquest. It was then owned by the king. The Library and Museum with the war memorial in front During the medieval period Dartford was an important waypoint for pilgrims and travellers en route to Canterbury and the Continent, and various religious orders established themselves in the area. In the 12th century the Knights Templar had possession of the manor of Dartford; the National Trust property at Sutton-at-Hone, to the south of the town, is a remaining piece of that history. In the 14th century, a priory was established here, and two groups of friars‚Äîthe Dominicans and the Franciscans‚Äîbuilt hospitals here for the care of the sick. At this time the town became a small but important market town. Wat Tyler, of Peasants' Revolt fame, might well have been a local hero, although three other towns in Kent all claim likewise, and there are reasons to doubt the strength of Tyler's connection to Dartford, though the existence of a town centre public house named after him could give credence to Dartford's claim. Dartford, however, cannot claim a monopoly on public houses named after Tyler. It is probable that Dartford was a key meeting point early in the Peasants' Revolt with a detachment of Essex rebels marching south to join Kentish rebels at Dartford before accompanying them to Rochester and Canterbury in the first week of June 1381. Although lacking a leader, Kentishmen had assembled at Dartford around 5 June through a sense of county solidarity at the mistreatment of Robert Belling, a man claimed as a serf by Sir Simon Burley. Burley had abused his royal court connections to invoke the arrest of Belling and, despite a compromise being proposed by bailiffs in Gravesend, continued to demand the impossible ¬£300 of silver for Belling's release. Having left for Rochester and Canterbury on 5 June, the rebels passed back through Dartford, swollen in number, a week later on 12 June en route for London. The gatehouse of Henry VIII's Royal Manor In the 15th century, two kings of England became part of the town's history. Henry V marched through Dartford in November 1415 with his troops after fighting the French at the Battle of Agincourt; in 1422 Henry's body was taken to Holy Trinity Church by Edmund Lacey, Bishop of Exeter, who conducted a funeral. In March 1452, Richard, Duke of York, camped at the Brent allegedly with ten thousand men, waiting for a confrontation with King Henry VI. The Duke surrendered to the king in Dartford. The place of the camp is marked today by York Road, Dartford. The 16th century saw significant changes to the hitherto agrarian basis of the market in Dartford, as new industries began to take shape (see below). The priory was destroyed in 1538 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and a new manor house was subsequently constructed by King Henry VIII. In 1545, Henry held a series of meetings of his Privy Council in the town, and from 21 to 25 June 1545 Dartford was the seat of the national government.Wall plaque mounted in the reception of the Priory, photographed 25 April 2018. Henry's fourth wife Anne of Cleves lived at the new priory for four years before her death in 1557. Many Protestants were executed during the reigns of Queen Mary (1553‚Äì1554) and Philip and Mary (1554‚Äì1558), including Christopher Wade, a Dartford linen-weaver who was burnt at the stake on the Brent in 1555. The Martyrs' Memorial on East Hill commemorates Wade and other Kentish Martyrs. In 1576 Dartford Grammar School was founded, part of the Tudor emphasis on education for ordinary people. =Industrial history= Mural depicting Dartford's industrial heritage painted at One Bell Corner. The mural was designed and painted in 2000 by artist Gary Drostle. The earliest industries were those connected with agriculture, such as the brewing of traditional beers and ales. Lime-burning and chalk-mining also had their place. Fulling was another: the cleansing of wool needed a great deal of water, which the river could provide. This led to other water-based industries, using hydropower to operate machinery. Upon his return in 1578 from Frobisher Bay in the Canadian Arctic with a reputed cargo of gold-bearing ore, Sir Martin Frobisher had the refining done on Powder Mill Lane in Dartford. However, the ore proved valueless and was used for road surfacing. Sir John Spilman set up the first paper mill in England at Dartford in 1588 on a site near Powder Mill Lane, and soon some 600 employees worked there, providing an invaluable source of local employment. Iron-making on the Weald was in full operation at this time, and iron ingots were sent to Dartford, to England's first iron-slitting mill, set up by the Darent at Dartford Creek in 1595 by Godfrey Box, an immigrant from the Low Countries. In 1785, John Hall, a millwright set up a workshop in Lowfield Street and began to make engines, boilers and machinery (some of it for the local gunpowder factory run by Miles Peter Andrews and the Pigou family), marking the foundation of J & E Hall, an engineering firm specialising in heavy engineering, and later refrigerating equipment, and, for 20 years from 1906, vehicle production, plus lifts and escalators. From those humble beginnings in the 18th century was to come the industrial base on which the growth and prosperity of Dartford were founded. In 1840 the mustard factory of Saunders & Harrison was described as being \\"perhaps the largest in the kingdom\\".'Pigots 1840', on website freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~shebra/pigots_1840 accessed 5 December 2007 Dartford Paper Mills were built in 1862, when excise duty on paper was abolished. Between 1844 and 1939 the fabric printing works of Augustus Applegath were in being in Bullace Lane: again a firm using the waters of the river. RAF Joyce Green, at Long Reach, near Dartford was one of the first Royal Flying Corp airfields, It was established in 1911 by Vickers Limited (the aircraft and weapons manufacturer, who used it as an airfield and testing ground. It was superseded by Biggin Hill, and closed in 1919. The demand created by World War I meant that output at the local Vickers factory multiplied, with a positive effect on the local economy. Burroughs-Wellcome chemical works (later incorporated into GlaxoSmithKline) made Dartford a centre for the pharmaceutical industry. There has been a large power station at Littlebrook on the Thames, to the north of the town, since 1939. The current station, which features one of the tallest chimneys in the UK, dates from about 1978. The Chemical Works at Dartford c. 1896 =Post-industrial economic plans= The Mazda motor manufacturer has its UK head office at the large Thames-side Crossways Business Park. Thomas Walter Jennings created the iconic Vox musical brand, with original products such as the AC15 and AC30 amplifiers originating in Dartford. In early 2006, the since-closed South East England Development Agency (SEEDA) purchased the former Unwins (an off-licence chain that went into administration in 2005) depot on the edge of the town. The warehouse was demolished and a business centre, The Base, built in its place. The Base will be managed by Basepoint Centres and funded by the non- departmental public body, HCA. By 2018, the former GlaxoSmithKline manufacturing site in Mill Pond Road had been redeveloped with residential apartments and is known as Langley Square. Further regeneration is taking place at Market Street, to be known as Brewery Square.Dartford Borough Council https://www.dartford.gov.uk/by-category/environment-and-planning2/new- planning-homepage/planning-policy/dartford-town-centre Economy Low cost shopping units in the Priory shopping centre Some of Dartford's key industries, including brewing, paper-making, flour milling and the manufacture of cement, suffered extreme decline in the 20th century, causing redundancies and unemployment. Swanscombe Cement Works (now redeveloped into Bluewater shopping centre) was closed by Blue Circle in 1990. This industry had been an economic boon to the area, but left behind a lot of derelict land and pollution. In 1990 Dartford contained around of spoiled land resulting from extractive industries, and cement-dust pollution from local cement works was a regular subject of complaint in the local press throughout the 20th century. The closure of Dartford's major employers: Seagers' Engineering Works, J & E Hall International, Vickers, the reduction and subsequent closure of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline), and the redevelopment of nearby Bexleyheath as a shopping town in the 1970s (and the more recent development of the Bluewater Shopping Centre), have had a negative effect on the economy of Dartford, but the town is still home to major brands such as Sainsbury's, W.H. Smiths, and Boots. With the opening of the major Bluewater regional shopping centre just outside the town, the high street has seen a growth in cheaper brands such as Primark and Wilko taking over empty premises. In the 1990s, the local economy was boosted by the establishment of a number of business parks in the area, the biggest being Crossways Business Park at the foot of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. In 2007 Dartford saw an increase in the number of chain stores located in the town as B&Q;, M&S; Simply Food, TK Maxx and Asda Living opened new outlet stores in the town centre. Before this Safeway had taken part in the development of Dartford's second shopping centre, The Orchards, located next to the Orchard Theatre. The Safeway's site was eventually taken over by Waitrose but this closed in March 2014 and a new Aldi store opened in June 2015. The historical and once bustling main High Street and adjacent shopping centre, The Priory, continue to decline, and went into receivership in 2013. and the large department store previously occupied by the Co-operative has now been demolished, having been bought by Dartford Borough Council. The oldest independent business still trading in Dartford, the butchers Richardson & Sons in Lowfield Street, established in 1908, closed down in 2014 to make way for the proposed Lowfield centre superstore development. The problems with obtaining planning permission for this development and associated residential units were compounded by the recession. This created persistent delay in regeneration of the Lowfield Street site, and on 8 January 2015 it was finally announced that the Tesco plans were to be abandoned. Culture and community The Orchard Theatre Central Park The Orchard Theatre, located in the town centre, is a fully professional theatre, providing audiences with a large range of drama, dance, music and entertainment. The Mick Jagger Centre, within the grounds of Dartford Grammar School on Shepherds Lane, was completed in 2000 and provides facilities for community arts across a wide region. library and Museum are located on Market Street. Central Park is a formal park in the town centre, used for various community events. It comprises of land. =Sport= Dartford F.C. play at Princes Park Stadium and compete in the National League South. There are also three other senior clubs based in Dartford: Southern Counties East Football League Division 1 club Kent Football United F.C. and Kent County Football League clubs Fleetdown United who play at Heath Lane Lower, and Halls AFC who play at the Community Stadium at Princes Park. Dartford Harriers Athletic Club was formed in 1922 and is currently based at Central Park. Originally founded as Dartford Rugby Football Club, the rugby players began taking part in cross-country runs in an effort to keep fit. Running soon became more popular with the players, and the club eventually dropped rugby around the end of the 1927-28 season, becoming Dartford Harriers AC. The club's running colours of blue and blue \\"hoops\\" are a legacy from the club's rugby origins, when the rugby players simply removed the sleeves from their old rugby shirts to create running vests. Dartfordians Rugby Football Club have five adult teams and a large youth section, and play their home matches at War Memorial Club House on Bourne Road. Their first team currently plays in London 1 South, following promotion from London 2 South- East in the 2017-18 season. Dartford is also home to Dartford and White Oak Triathlon Club; formed in 1988, it is one of the oldest British Triathlon Federation clubs in the UK. The club trains at The Bridge Estate, Dartford. Sports centres in Dartford include the Becket Sports Centre, within the grounds of Dartford Grammar School on Shepherds Lane, which is the home of several sports groups. =Health= Between 1877 and 1903 the number of hospitals in Dartford rose to 11, together providing 10,000 hospital beds, at a time when the town's population was a little over 20,000. The majority of these have been closed, especially since the opening of Darent Valley Hospital. One of the best-known, Stone House Hospital, in Cotton Lane to the east of the town, was opened on 16 April 1866 as the \\"City of London Lunatic Asylum\\". It was, and still is, a large castellated structure built in spacious grounds. It remained under the direct administration of the City of London until 1948, when it was transferred to the National Health Service (NHS). It remains one of the largest and most visible structures in Dartford, and was until recently operated by the NHS to manage regional health care delivery, and was also home to a nursing school, Livingstone Hospital, on East Hill. The main buildings of this facility are now closed, and have been turned into luxury flats. Transport Fastrack buses at Greenhithe railway station Dartford railway station =Roads= The route of a Celtic ancient trackway which the Romans later paved and identified as Iter III on the Antonine Itinerary, later to be called Watling Street, and which the current A2 roughly follows, passed close to the town. After the Romans left Britain, it fell out of use, as the town itself developed and traffic went into the town itself, the name Watling Street transferring to the new route. The introduction of stagecoach services increased the amount of traffic through the town, so that by the 18th century it had become necessary to control the upkeep of such a heavily used road. Turnpike Trusts were set up by Act of Parliament. Dartford was served by two: that for Watling Street; and the road south to Sevenoaks, both brought into being between 1750 and 1780. From 1925 the A2 main road took traffic away from Dartford town centre via the Princes Road bypass. Today the original main road through the town is the A226. The erstwhile turnpike road south to Sevenoaks is now the A225). A newer by-pass is the A206, which skirts the town to the north. Its prime purpose is to carry traffic from the riverside industrial developments on to the Dartford Crossing from both west and east. Dartford is perhaps most well known for the latter, the main mode of crossing the River Thames to the east of London, where the southbound A282 (part of the London Orbital) crosses the river via the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge toll bridge, opened in 1991. The northbound carriageway crosses via the twin bore Dartford Tunnel. The first tunnel was opened in 1963, and the second in 1980. =Rail= Dartford railway station is located in the town centre and is connected to London via three National Rail routes. The first railway London to Dartford connection was the North Kent Line via Woolwich Arsenal in 1849, connecting at Gravesend with the line to the Medway Towns. Later two more lines were built, the Dartford Loop Line through Sidcup, which opened in 1866, and the Bexleyheath Line, which opened in 1895. All the lines were electrified on 6 June 1926. =Buses= Dartford is served by many bus services provided by Transport for London, Arriva Kent Thameside and Go Coach Buses. These routes connect Dartford with areas including Bexleyheath, Crayford, Erith, Gravesend, Greenhithe, Orpington, Sidcup, Swanley, Welling & Woolwich. Education Places of worship The ford, now Dartford Bridge over the River Darent, and Holy Trinity Church Richard Trevithick memorial at St. Edmund's Park. The Parish Church, Holy Trinity, is situated on the western bank of the River Darent, from where a hermit would conduct travellers across the ford. The church was originally a 9th-century Saxon structure, but gained later Norman additions. In the 13th century a royal wedding was celebrated there; thus today the choristers are entitled to wear scarlet cassocks. Also on display within the church is a brass plaque commemorating the work of Richard Trevithick, the pioneer of steam propulsion, who, at the end of his career, lived, worked (at J & E Hall) and died in the town. The graveyard is situated in St Edmund's Pleasance on the summit of East Hill (the place where Richard Trevithick is buried), which gave rise to a traditional and derogatory rhyme of Dartford's people: \\"Dirty Dartford, filthy people, bury their dead above the steeple.\\" The church actually has no steeple; it has a tower featuring a ring of eight bells.Kenticisms Notable people The following are from or have lived in Dartford (or other connection if specified): *Doreen Allen (1879‚Äì1963), militant suffragette *Malcolm Allison (1927‚Äì2010), football player and manager *Andrea Arnold (born 1961), Oscar and BAFTA winning film director *George Barton (1808‚Äì1864), Sussex cricketer *Martina Bergman- √ñsterberg (1849‚Äì1915), physical education pioneer and founder of Dartford College *Peter Blake (born 1932), pop artist *Richard Cant (born 1964), actor *Dave Charnley (1935‚Äì2012), undefeated British Lightweight Champion boxer (1957‚Äì63) *Ron Cooper (1932‚Äì2012), bicycle frame builder *Mackenzie Crook (born 1971), actor *Graham Dilley (1959‚Äì2011), Kent and England cricketer *Peter Glaze (1917-1983), Comedian *Len Goodman (born 1944), dancer and reality TV judge (Strictly Come Dancing) *Ivor Gurney (1890‚Äì1937), composer and poet *John Hall (1765-1836), founder of engineering business J & E Hall, based in Dartford *Laura Hamilton (born 1982), TV presenter (A Place in the Sun), attended Dartford Grammar School for Girls *Paul Hartnoll (born 1968) and Phil Hartnoll (born 1964), electronic musicians and members of the band Orbital *Henry Havelock (1795‚Äì1857), military general *Jimmy Havoc (born 1984), professional wrestler *Barry Hawkins (born 1979), professional snooker player *Terry Hollands (born 1979), Britain's Strongest Man (2007) *Henry Ambrose Hunt (1866‚Äì1946), meteorologist *Mick Jagger (born 1943), vocalist and songwriter, The Rolling Stones *Diane Keen (born 1946), actress *Sidney Keyes (1922‚Äì1943), war poet *John Latham (1743‚Äì1837), ornithologist *Nick Lee (born 1983), cricketer *Phil May (born 1944), vocalist, The Pretty Things *Patrick Mackay (born 1952), serial killer *Matt Morgan (born 1977), comedy writer, The Original Victim *Aaron Morris (born 1991), comedian and TV presenter *Topsy Ojo (born 1985), London Irish and England rugby union full-back, attended Dartford Grammar School *Min Patel (born 1970), Kent and England cricketer *Keith Richards (born 1943), guitarist and songwriter, The Rolling Stones *Steve Rider (born 1950), TV sports presenter *David Russell (born 1957), golfer *Paul Samson (1953‚Äì2002), rock guitarist *Alfred Sturge (1816‚Äì1901), pastor and missionary *Dick Taylor (born 1943), guitarist, The Pretty Things *Margaret Thatcher (1925‚Äì2013), Prime Minister who unsuccessfully ran to be MP of Dartford in 1950 and 1951 *Pete Tong (born 1960), house DJ *Richard Trevithick (1771‚Äì1833), inventor and mining engineer, died in Dartford *William James Erasmus Wilson (1809‚Äì1884), surgeon References Bibliography *Kent History Illustrated - Frank W Jessup (KCC, 1966) *Railways of the Southern Region - Geoffrey Body (PSL Field Guide 1989) External links *The Dartford town archive * Dartford Town Guide * Two maps of the area c.1800 * Towns in Kent Market towns in Kent Port of London Populated places on the River Thames Unparished areas in Kent Borough of Dartford ","title":"Dartford"},{"id":"1211853","text":"The A229 is a major road running north‚Äìsouth through Kent from Rochester to Hawkhurst via Maidstone. It is a former Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings. The road is well known for Blue Bell Hill, which connects Rochester to Maidstone through the North Downs, and links the M2 and M20 motorways. A popular ghost story documents a driver picking up a phantom female hitch-hiker on the A229 outside the Lower Bell pub, who subsequently disappears inside the driver's car. Route The A229 is about long. The road passes through little in the way of built-up areas aside from the Medway Towns and Maidstone. It is principally a link between these two areas and the south coast around Hastings. The road begins in the Medway town of Rochester at the top of Star Hill forming a junction with the A2. It then climbs up through the built-up area of Rochester and Chatham, passing Troy Town and Rochester Airport and the M2 motorway before descending the scarp slope of the North Downs at Blue Bell Hill. Below the road as it descends is the tunnel carrying High Speed 1. Once into the Medway Valley, there is a junction with the M20 motorway, and it follows the River Medway into Maidstone town centre. There are junctions with several main roads here, including the A26, A20 and A249. Beyond Maidstone, the road climbs up Greensand Ridge to Loose, built on the ridge's southern slope, before running through the valley of the River Beult to Staplehurst. Beyond this, it follows the Weald through Cranbrook and climbs another hill to Hawkhurst. The road ends on the A21 London ‚Äì Hastings Road near Hurst Green. =Traffic= The A229 through Maidstone is a major bottleneck on the route, with long daily morning and evening queues entering both sides of the town. =Checkpoints= In 2006, the road was set up with the then largest vehicle checkpoint campaign in Kent, in order to catch drug dealers and benefit fraudsters. Twenty-seven vehicles were apprehended, but there were no arrests. History The road largely follows the route of Roman Road No. 13, as described by Ivan Margary, which ran from Rochester to Hastings. It was turnpiked between Rochester and Maidstone in 1728, then to Cranbrook in 1760. The A229 number was assigned in 1923, following the turnpike road. The original route through Maidstone ran along Sandling Road and Week Street; the diversion along the riverside opened in 1978. It runs partially on the site of Fremlin's Brewery, whose production site in Maidstone had then recently closed. The southern extent of the road from Hawkhurst to Sedlescombe was downgraded to a B-road in the 1990s. Ghost stories The Lower Bell pub at Blue Bell Hill on the pre-bypass A229; where the phantom hitch-hiker has been reported On 19 November 1965, three women were severely injured in a road accident at Blue Bell Hill on the A229 when their Ford Cortina collided with a Jaguar. One of the women, 22-year old Susan Browne from Gillingham, who was due to wed RAF technician Brian Wetton, died five days later at West Kent Hospital in Maidstone; the two other females, Judith Lingham and Patricia Ferguson, died soon after the accident. Since then, there have been several reports of ghosts relating to the accident. The basic story is that a driver passing the Lower Bell pub on the A229 spots a lone female dressed in white at the side of the road. He offers her a lift, and she gives him an address. Some time later, the driver looks in the rear view mirror to discover she has disappeared. Other variations of the story report a small purse or handbag left behind, or that when the driver reaches the intended address, he is informed by a family member there that his passenger died several years previously. The legend has now become one of the best-known ghost stories involving phantom hitch-hiking in the United Kingdom, and the Blue Bell Hill Road is reported to be one of the most haunted roads in the country. On 13 July 1974, local bricklayer Maurice Goodenough ran into Rochester Police Station and reported he had run over a girl aged around 10 on Blue Bell Hill, who suffered several cuts, and had left her at the roadside wrapped in a blanket. When the police returned to the scene, the girl had disappeared, and despite an extensive radius search of the area, the girl was never found. A further incident of the lone female variant of the story was reported in 1992. Other variations are drivers reporting to have driven straight through a girl in the middle of the road, without any apparent injury. In 2014, a local group wrote and directed the short film, The Ghost of Blue Bell Hill, which covers the numerous ghost stories relating to the road.

He was also the President of the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology. Biography Born in Odessa in the present-day Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) as Yakov Dostrovsky (), son of Tzvi and Myriam, his family emigrated to Ottoman Palestine following the anti-Jewish pogrom in Odessa in 1905. Upon completing high school at the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, he enlisted in the Jewish Legion of the British Army during World War I. Following the war he studied engineering at the University of Ghent. When he returned to Palestine in 1926 he joined the Haganah and adopted the underground name of \\"Dan\\". In Haganah he was the commander of the Haganah Forces of Haifa. In 1939, Dori was appointed Chief of Staff of the Haganah, a position he held until 1946. As CoS Haganah it was Yaakov Dori's duty to take the Haganah from a diffuse self-defense organisation to a model army. From 1946 to 1947 he also headed the Palestinian Jewish delegation sent to purchase arms in the United States. When the IDF was formed, Dori took over as its first Chief of Staff. Yet, despite his good command and organizational skills, he was already suffering from failing health and had difficulty commanding his troops during the 1948 Palestine War, so he was forced to rely heavily on his deputy, Yigael Yadin. He completed his term as Chief of Staff on November 9, 1949 and retired from the military. He was succeeded by his deputy, Yadin. Even after his release from the army, however, he continued to wear the officer's pin he was awarded when he first became a second lieutenant. Upon leaving the IDF, Dori was appointed chairman of the nation's Science Council, attached to the Prime Minister's office. He was later appointed president of the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa in 1951, a position he held until 1965. He followed Shlomo Kaplansky, and was followed by Alexander Goldberg. Yaakov Dori was married since 1929 to the teacher Badana, born Pintov, from the locality Kurenetz in Ukraine. His son, Yerachmiel Dori, served as commander of the IDF's Engineering Corps. His daughter, Etana Padan, is a biochemist and a professor of microbial ecology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His youngest son, Zvi Dori, was a Chemistry Professor at the Technion and the founder of the first Israeli Science Museum (Technoda). Israel Dostrovsky, physical chemistry and former President of the Weizmann Institute of Science, was his first cousin.:he:◊ê◊®◊ô◊î ◊ì◊ï◊°◊ò◊®◊ï◊ë◊°◊ß◊ô Namesakes The Israel Defense Forces base at Tel HaShomer, one of the largest in Israel, is named after Ya'akov Dori.

It was initiated by students and professors at the University of Bucharest. The Golaniad started in April 1990, before the election of 20 May 1990, which was the first election after the Romanian Revolution. Their main demand was that former leading members of the Communist Party should be banned from standing in elections. Background Ion Iliescu and Frontul SalvƒÉrii Na≈£ionale (FSN) seized power during the 1989 revolution. The FSN organization was meant to act as a temporary government until free elections were to be held. However, on 23 January 1990, despite its earlier claims, it decided to become a party and to run in the elections it would organize. A part of the dissenters and anti-communists that joined the FSN during the revolution (including Doina Cornea) left following this decision. Many of the FSN personalities, including its president, Ion Iliescu, were ex-communists and as such the revolution was seen as being hijacked by the FSN.Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ. \\"Iluziile au durat numai o lunƒÉ. Au murit √Æn zadar at√¢≈£ia rom√¢ni?\\", 25 January 1990. The FSN, which was widely known from the revolution and associated with it, won 66.3% of the votes, while the next party - the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania - obtained only 7.2% of the votes (followed by PNL 1- 6.4%, MER- 2.6%). The protests TR-85 tank in Bucharest in early 1990, during the Golaniad. On 22 April 1990, the Independent Group for Democracy (Grupul Independent pentru Democra»õie)Rus, p. 75 organised a demonstration in Aviators' Square. After the peaceful demonstration, groups of people marched towards the Romanian Television (TVR) station, calling for its political independence. The following day, PN»ö-CD organized an even larger protest (around 2500-3000 people), occupying the road in the University Square and a part of the protesters decided to sit-in overnight. The protests drew the ire of the authorities, who, during the night between 23‚Äì24 April, began a repression of the protesters. The law enforcement agents beat up the protesters and arrested some of them. The authorities' violence had the exact opposite effect than the one expected, as more people came. Two days later, they were still there, their numbers growing, on the evening of 25 April, their number reaching 30,000. The sympathetic press reported even higher numbers, up to 50,000 each evening.Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ. \\"Nu plecƒÉm acasƒÉ\\". 8 May 1990 A number of protesters began a hunger strike. President Ion Iliescu refused to negotiate with the protesters and called them \\"golani\\" (\\"golan\\" meaning a hooligan, a scamp, a ruffian or a good-for-nothing ‚Äî which later gave the protest its name) or legionnaires. The leadership of the National Salvation Front realized that the protests grew too big to be able to repress them without impunity, so it focused on demonizing them on the state-controlled media.Rus, p. 76 This part of the media called the protesters \\"delinquents\\", \\"hooligans\\", \\"parasites\\", \\"thieves\\", \\"extremists\\", \\"fascists\\", \\"traitors\\", etc. This campaign was successful particularly outside Bucharest, where the government-owned media was the only source of information. The public television showed reports of the protests in which they interviewed people marginal to both the protests and the Romanian society, such as Roma people, hawksters and prowlers.Rus, p. 77 Name and anthem The ending \\"-ad\\" (\\"-ada\\" in Romanian) was used ironically, since many of Ceau≈üescu's Communist manifestations had endings like this, for instance the annual national sporting event Daciad (in order to compare them either with an epic, like the Iliad or, rather, with the international Olympiad). The protesters also composed their own hymn, \\"Imnul Golanilor\\": :Mai bine haimana, dec√¢t trƒÉdƒÉtor :Mai bine huligan, dec√¢t dictator :Mai bine golan, dec√¢t activist :Mai bine mort dec√¢t comunist\\" :: lyrics by Laura Botolan; music by Cristian Pa»õurcƒÉ The song can be translated to English as: :Better to be a tramp than a traitor, :Better to be a hooligan than a dictator, :Better to be a hoodlum than an activist, :Better to be dead than communist\\" Support Many intellectuals supported the protests, including writers like Octavian Paler, Ana Blandiana, Gabriel Liiceanu, Stelian TƒÉnase and film director Lucian Pintilie. Eug√®ne Ionesco supported them by sending a telegram from France in which he wrote he was a \\"Golan Academician\\" (Hooligan Academician).\\"Fenomenul Piata Universitatii 1990\\" , Revista 22, May 12, 2003 Demands Their main three demands were the followingJames Baker's speech in the US Senate, quoted by Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, 19 May 1990 # the eighth point of the Proclamation of Timi»ôoara: leading members of the Romanian Communist Party and the Securitate not to be allowed to be candidates in the elections # access to the state- owned mass media for all candidates, not only FSN candidates. A 1975 law of Ceau≈üescu (which was not yet repealed) allowed the president of Romania to directly control Romanian television and radio. # postponing of the elections, since the only party that had the resources for the campaign was FSN. The protesters also disagreed with the official doctrine of the FSN that the Revolution was only \\"anti-Ceau≈üescu\\" and not \\"anti-Communist\\" (as Silviu Brucan declared in an interview given to the British newspaper The Guardian). They also supported faster reforms, a true free market economy and a western- type democracy (Ion Iliescu argued for a \\"Swedish-style\\" socialism and an \\"original democracy\\", considering multi-party system as being antiquatedVladimir TismƒÉneanu, \\"Semnifica≈£iile revolu≈£iei rom√¢ne\\" , Jurnalul Na≈£ional). After the elections the protests continued, the main goal being the removal of the government. Violent ending After 52 days of protests, on 13‚Äì15 June, a violent confrontation with government supporters and miners from the Jiu Valley ended the protests, with many of the protesters and bystanders being beaten and wounded. Sources differ on the number of the casualties, the government confirming seven deaths related to the events.

The median age was 36.9 years, with 399 people (9.1%) aged under 15 years, 1,116 (25.3%) aged 15 to 29, 2,370 (53.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 522 (11.8%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 80.1% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 7.9% MƒÅori, 5.4% Pacific peoples, 11.7% Asian, and 4.6% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 35.0%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 59.3% had no religion, 28.4% were Christian, and 6.9% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 2,073 (51.7%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 210 (5.2%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $54,600. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 2,520 (62.9%) people were employed full-time, 489 (12.2%) were part-time, and 117 (2.9%) were unemployed.  Geography  Waterfront in ca 1930, with the older coastline of 1841 also shown as a darker line. Freemans Bay to the left. Lower Freemans Bay and Victoria Park, sometime in the early 20th century, looking west along Wellesley Street West. Since the turn of the 20th century, extensive land reclamation (partly using stone quarried from nearby headlands) has seen Freemans Bay itself disappear. The reclamation of the old bay was finished in 1901, and Victoria Park was created on most of the resulting flat area.Business History Project:Timeline (from the University of Auckland website. Retrieved 2007-12-05) It is still public land used mostly for sports purposes. The coastline shifted more than one kilometre to the northwest of the city centre and is now composed of the concrete wharves of Viaduct Basin and the Tank Farm or as it is now renamed, the Wynyard Quarter.  History  Heritage houses in Freemans Bay. =MƒÅori origins= Waiatarau (or 'Reflecting Waters') was the MƒÅori name for the bay that is now Victoria Park, although other names were used to refer to the area; such as Wai K≈çtota ('The place where the cockles are harvested') and Te Koranga ('The scaffolds', referring to the racks upon which fish would be hung to dry in the sun). A stream called Waikuta ('Waters of the reed') discharged into the south eastern corner of the bay (bottom of College Hill Road) while the Tunamau ('To catch eels') stream came down from what is now Western Park and met the bay at the bottom of what is now Franklin Road. =European name= Freemans Bay is one of the earliest settled areas in Auckland, and was earmarked for development and land reclamation in the 1840s by Colonial Surveyor Felton Matthew who laid out the streets along the shores of the local bays.Historical Background (from the Addendum 2 February 2006 of the Vic Park Tunnel project documentation, Transit New Zealand, Page 4. Accessed 2008-02-20.) Freemans Bay is probably named after Captain William Hobson‚Äôs secretary, James Stuart Freeman who apparently lived in the area. He was described by Dr John Logan Campbell in 1844 as \\"the most disgustingly immoral swindling scoundrel in town\\". Local gossip had it that he was not actually married to the woman he was living with, or that there was something amiss in her past. She apparently had been on intimate terms with Mrs Hobson and others in the Government House circle but after William Hobson's death in 1842 and Mrs Hobson's return to Britain she found herself shut out of genteel society in Auckland. This pained Eleanor Freeman enormously and enraged her husband. Living in a workers cottage on the wrong side of town certainly couldn't have helped her social status. After her early death at the age of 26 on 17 December 1844 Freeman added to the wagging tongues by remarrying just six weeks later. After his marriage to Mary Ann Miller on 29 January 1845 the Freemans left New Zealand. =Industry and slums= While settled as one of the earliest parts of the country by Europeans,Iconic Auckland market to be revamped - NZPA via 'infonews.co.nz', Friday 6 April 2007 the area was never seen as a desirable place to live. The rich favoured the other side of Queen Street, clustering around the governor's mansion (where the University is now located) and enjoying views of the harbour and Rangitoto, this was even referred to as the 'right side' of Queen Street. On the \\"wrong side of Queen Street\\" were located most of the smelly and noisy industries including the abattoir and the gasworks of the Auckland Gas Company. As well as brickworks, by 1883 the area was the location of nine shipyards, three sawmills, a brass and iron foundry, a glassworks, an asphalt works, as well as several coal and lime traders. Also found here were several public facilities like the city morgue, a night soil dump and from 1905 the city rubbish incinerator (known as the 'Destructor', which became Victoria Park Market and was rebranded as Victoria Park Village in 2017). Around these occupations were gathered some of the more modest houses in 19th century Auckland. Two land auctions in 1864 in this area were the \\"Brookville\\" estate (121 sites) and \\"Alma Place\\" (152 sites). The large number of building sites are probably an indication of the very small size of the building sections. These workers cottages were built very close together and often poorly constructed, sometimes being little better than hovels with dirt floors. Not all the housing in the area was so modest, however; on Franklin Road, which rises up the hill towards the Ponsonby ridge, were built larger houses, including several two storied houses, and in 1873 the street was beautified by the City Council by planting it with plane trees. Many of these larger houses subsequently became boarding establishments for male workers from the adjacent industries. In 1910 the average house for sale on Franklin Road was advertised for ¬£736, while the average house in Victoria Road, Remuera, was considered worth ¬£1279 at the time. In 1905 Victoria Park was created which included sports grounds, a sports pavilion and a children's playground. The playground equipment was donated by Mr John Court of the John Court Department Store. In 1909 a kindergarten for the local children was opened. It soon ran into financial problems, however, from which it was rescued by Dr John Logan Campbell. The brick building stood for many years unused, recently restored by Auckland Council and NZTA as part of the works around the Victoria Park Tunnel. During the 1918 flu epidemic, the sports pavilion was used as a depot for corpses awaiting transportation by rail to the city cemeteries. =Urban renewal= Western Park. As a working class area, Freemans Bay was greatly affected by the Great Depression. By 1930, the percentage of unskilled workers amongst the male population of Freemans Bay had risen to 39%, whereas in affluent Remuera it was only 2%. Conversely, only 11% of all males of Freemans Bay worked in \\"white-collar\\" or \\"business and professional\\" roles, whereas in Remuera the same percentage had grown to 86% by that time, a sign of the increasing homogenisation of Auckland suburbs.New Zealand Historical Atlas - McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, 1997, Plate 73 Freemans Bay was seen as a centre of crime, prostitution, sedition and Union Activity. There were also concerns about it being a source of infectious diseases, including plague and tuberculosis. In the 1930s, the Auckland City Council set up a committee called \\"The Decadent Areas Committee\\" (later renamed as the \\"Housing Committee\\") largely to deal with the area. In the 1930s and 1940s, many MƒÅori who moved into the city looking for work came to live in the cheap housing of the area.Maori Community Centre Site Purchase (from a newsletter of the Ngati Whatua o Orakei Maori Trust Board, Issue 16 September 2004. Accessed 2008-02-14.) This pattern was repeated in the 1950s and 1960s when Pacific Islanders arrived in New Zealand seeking employment as well. During the Second World War, Victoria Park was commandeered and covered with a military camp for the American Armed Forces. The adjacent areas St Mary's Bay and Freemans Bay became notorious as the location of many brothels along with illicit drinking and gambling establishments. Many of the women in the area were keen to have fun with the American troops who were known to be generous with money, cigarettes and nylon stockings. The distinction made by the authorities and most respectable people between a female being a 'loose woman' and being a prostitute was pretty vague. St Mary's Bay was known for being more expensive and tended to cater for the officers, while Freeman's Bay was for the lower end of the market. This reputation clung to the area after the war. When the motorway system was constructed from 1955 onwards, it was an ideal excuse to demolish large areas of Freemans Bay in the name of slum clearance and progress. The motorway cut large swathes through Freemans Bay taking out good housing as well as slum-type buildings. It has been alleged by some critics that the decision to delay completion of the Western Ring Route (proposed for a long time before the motorway was built through Freemans Bay) was motivated by the fact that the new Auckland Harbour Bridge required higher toll revenues to repay its construction cost. Several developments of flats and townhouses were built in the area during the 1960s and 1970s both by Auckland City Council and Central Government - though a much more extensive 1950s plan, which would have seen most of Freemans Bays' houses levelled and replaced by medium-density housing blocks, did not come to pass. Only a few blocks were constructed along Whitson Terrace where they are still present today.New Zealand Historical Atlas - McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, 1997, Plate 75 Later, during the 1980s and 1990s, the remaining Victorian houses began to be gentrified along with the neighbouring suburbs of Ponsonby and St Marys Bay and they are now some of Auckland's most fashionable and desirable residences. On Victoria Street opposite Victoria Park stands a group of brick Edwardian industrial buildings. Built between 1905 & 1915 and known as \\"the Destructor\\", this facility generated electricity by burning the city's rubbish. Opened by the Mayor Arthur Myers, this facility was closed in 1972, and in 1983 it was converted into a market called Victoria Park Market, latterly rebranded as Victoria Park Village. Behind Victoria Park Village is the Drake hotel which sits at a slightly higher level than the Village, Victoria Street and the park. This shows the outline of the ancient sea cliff. From 1905 onwards, Freemans Bay was filled in to create the park. After 1919 the reclamations continued and the area north of the park was created to provide more wharf area for the expanding Ports of Auckland. This included the Lighter Basin to the east and Wynyard Wharf to the west. From 2000 to 2003, the Lighter Basin was redeveloped as the Viaduct Basin, which served as a headquarters for the various yachting syndicates involved in the America's Cup campaigns of 2000 and 2003. The area is now an upper-class (multi-story) residential area. On the adjacent Fanshawe Street, previously dilapidated warehouses have been replaced by new prestigious office blocks, including Vodafone New Zealand. The Wynyard Quarter is also undergoing a great deal of redevelopment, which includes the new Silo Park. The suburb is now home to a much more affluent populace, with the 2006 median income at $41,400, much higher than the $26,800 average Auckland-wide. Around 32% of all residents live in single-person households, some in the many former Council and State Housing flats still existing in the area, though the housing stock is varied. =Notable buildings= * The Drake Hotel. This Victorian pub stands on the ancient sea cliff of the bay. The current structure replaced an earlier building which stood directly adjacent to the quayside where the ships were moored. * Victoria Park Village. Built between 1905 and 1915 as the city's rubbish incinerator and known as 'The Destructor' this building was opened by Mayor Arthur Myers. Until the 1950s this complex generated electricity by burning organic rubbish. In 1973 it was decommissioned and destined to be demolished. After a decade of standing vacant the brick Edwardian buildings were reopened as Victoria Park Market in 1983. * Former Campbell Kindergarten. Situated on the southern boundary of Victoria Park this brick structure was paid for by Sir John Logan Campbell. After the kindergarten moved to a more modern building this became the headquarters for the local cricket club and the rugby league team. After they moved to the newly rebuilt Sports Pavilion on the north side of the park in the 1990s the building stood derelict for many years. Recently renovated as part of the Victoria Park Tunnel project. * Birdcage Hotel - The Birdcage, formerly the Rob Roy Hotel is a Victorian pub built in 1885‚Äì1886. When it opened this pub stood directly on the quayside. From 1912 onwards the bay to the north was filled in and Victoria Park created. The Birdcage is registered by the NZHPT (Category II, No.636) and is scheduled on the District Plan (Category B). The Birdcage is situated on the corner of Franklin Road and Drake Street opposite Victoria Park Village. In order to preserve this building of high heritage significance, the decision was made to shift the Birdcage (excluding the basement) to a new site 40m along Franklin Road. The building was relocated slightly north of its original location following completion of the tunnel in 2011. * Former Gasworks - Beaumont Street. Elegant Edwardian brick buildings which have been converted into retail spaces and apartments. This set of buildings included a number of metal Gas Holders which have not survived. * Former Caretakers Cottage - north-east corner of Victoria Park. Arts & Crafts style cottage - recently restored and now operating as a cafe. * Sports Pavilion - 1990s replacement for the Edwardian structure. Here bodies of people who had died in the 1918 flu pandemic were stored before being transported to a mass grave at the Municipal Burial Ground at Waikumete Cemetery in west Auckland by train. * Former St Patrick's School - Wellington Street. Once occupied by McDonald's New Zealand as their Headquarters. * Bushell's Shop - Wellington Street. Last remaining shop from the shopping precinct demolished by Auckland City Council. Distinguished by a large advertisement for Bushells Tea, recently defaced by the present owners in a botched restoration. * Freemans Bay Community Centre - Hepburn Street. 1970s building by Auckland City Council. This hall opened in 1977 and came close to demolition after being badly damaged by a fire in 1999. After extensive refurbishment it was re-opened in April 2000. * Sheridan Square - 1970s town house development by Auckland City Council. * Auckland Girls' Grammar School - Howe Street. Brick Art & Crafts building built in 1909 but incorporating buildings from an earlier primary school. On the site of the 19th century Immigration Barracks. www.aggs.school.nz/ * 17 Hepburn Street. Large 19th century wooden Italianate residence built for Henry Elliot. * Te Kainga Aroha, 29 Hepburn Street. 1890s wooden house in the Queen Anne Style built for Andrew Entrican, a Deputy Mayor of Auckland. Since the 1940s this house has been the location of the Interdenominational United Maori Mission Girls Hostel; Te Kainga Aroha. * Queens Hall, 9 Paget Street. Brick and stucco concert hall built in the 1880s by a doting father so his daughter would have somewhere to sing. * 18 Paget St. Cottage at the centre of a heritage controversy. Apparently an 1850s structure moved here from Albert Park ridge. www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=... * Currie Residence - 50 Wood St. Wooden house from around 1900. Designed and built by architect John Currie as his own home. Currie was a carpenter before becoming an architect. * Blomfield House - 40 Wood Street. Built as the home of the well- known landscape painter Charles Blomfield (artist). This two storeyed wooden Italianate house was constructed by Charles' brother Samuel, reputedly from a single kauri tree. * McGregor House - 2 Franklin Road. Distinctive wooden Turret House built for one of Alexander McGregor's sons. Now Ponsonby Backpackers. McGregor senior lived next door in 'Holmdene', a brick and stucco mansion on Ponsonby Road. * Sinclair House - 68 Franklin Road. Two storeyed 19th century brick house with verandahs - unusual in an area where the Victorian houses are predominantly single storeyed and wooden. The television presenter Peter Sinclair owned this house in the 1970s-1980s. Education Freemans Bay School is a coeducational contributing primary (years 1-6) school with a roll of as of Close by local State secondary schools are Auckland Girls' Grammar School and the Catholic St Paul's College for boys and St Mary's College for girls.

This can occur in a game or tournament that they are strongly favored to win, or in an instance where they have a large lead that they squander in the late stages of the event. It can also refer to repeated failures in the same event, or simply infer an unexpected failure when the event is more important than usual. Most athletes experience physical and mental changes during stages of increased tension in competition. They may change their strategy as a coping mechanism, and play more cautiously as a result. In instances where this strategy fails, a player or team many lose confidence to the point of panic, where they are incapable of completing the most rudimentary of tasks. Choking in sport can be considered a form of analysis paralysis. The term itself is often an over- used, or even derisive term in the sports world, where \\"choke\\" status is assigned to a team or player that was simply unlucky. The term \\"clutch\\" is gaining popularity to describe the opposite of choking. Outside of North America, other terms, such as 'bottling it', 'lose one's nerve', or 'panic' are more widely used. Choking Choking under pressure decreases the standard level of athletic performance, of an athlete when they may be at their peak performance. Symptoms of choking may include tightening up of the muscles, an increased level of anxiety and a decrease in self-confidence. Choking can leave an athlete feeling embarrassed or frustrated. Causes Choking is sometimes caused when an athlete becomes distracted, their thoughts become negative or unproductive and when they worry about things they cannot control. Anxiety is built up from negative self-talk and doubt which leads to choking. The source of the pressure can vary, which leads to the choking itself manifesting in different ways. In some instances a player or team's first game, or a big occasion can lead to anxiety similar to stage fright, which may result in a poor start, or being on the receiving end of a rout. In other instances, the closeness of victory leads to increased anxiety, which may in turn lead to a dramatic loss. In the chaotic arena of a sporting contest, it is sometimes hard to identify if a player or team has panicked, or was simply victim to a strong finish by their opponents. Many athletes will play down publicly any notion of a loss of nerve, to prevent this being seen as a weakness. =Explicit monitoring theory= The explicit monitoring theory provides an explanation for athlete‚Äôs under-performance at the precise moment they need to be at their best. Sian Beilock and Tom Carr suggest that ‚Äúpressure raises self-consciousness and anxiety about performing correctly, which increases the attention paid to skill processes and their step-by-step control. Attention to execution at this step-by-step level is thought to disrupt well-learned or proceduralized performances.‚Äù =Distraction theory= Distraction theory was first suggested by Wine to explain under-performance in performance pressure situations. Distraction theorists argue that pressure creates a dual task situation which draws attention away from the task at hand. Attention is then focused towards irrelevant stimuli such as worries, social expectations, and anxiety Wine first tested his hypothesis with academic tests but it has since been applied to athletics. Research has found that distraction theory is supported in situations where working memory is used to analyze and make decisions quickly. Short term memory is used to maintain relevant stimuli and block irrelevant information as it relates to the task at hand.Miyake, A., & Shah, P. (1999). Models of working memory: Mechanisms of active maintenance and executive control. New York: University Press. A study at Arizona University looked at how athletes of different levels of experiences responded to distraction and self-analysis, and found that novice baseball players were more likely to see a drop in performance from a distracting noise. However, it also found that more experienced players were more susceptible to underperformance when they were asked to focus on their technique. =Self-focus theory= This theory predicts a decrease in performance is due to attention being shifted to movement execution. Any combination of factors that increase the importance of performing is considered performance pressure. Baumeister‚Äôs self-focus theory suggests responding to performance pressure can lead to an increase in self- consciousness which then results in choking. There is more focus on the motor components of performance, consciously controlling movements with step-by-step control. =Processing efficiency theory (PET)= Anxiety causes a shift in an athlete‚Äôs attention towards thought of performance consequences and failure. An increase in worry decreases attention resources. According to PET, athletes put extra effort into their performance when under pressure, to eliminate negative performance. Eysenck and Calvo found processing efficiency is affected by negative anxiety more than performance effectiveness. Efficiency being the relationship between the quality of task performance and the effort spent in task performance. =Attentional control theory (ACT)= Eysenck and Calvo developed ACT an extension to PET, hypothesizing an individual shifts attention to irrelevant stimuli. Stress and pressure cause an increase in the stimulus-driven system and a decrease in the goal-directed system. Disruption of balance between these two systems causes the individual to respond to salient stimuli rather than focusing on current goals. ACT identifies the basic central executive functions inhibition and shifting, which are affected by anxiety. Inhibition is the ability to minimize distractions caused from irrelevant stimuli. Shifting requires adapting to changes in attentional control. Shifting back and forth between mental sets due to task demands. =Attentional threshold model= According to the attentional threshold model, a performance decrement is caused by exceeded threshold of attentional capacity. This model combines both the self-focus models and the distraction models. The combination of worry and self-focus together causes a decrease in performance. Attentional Threshold Model suggests that choking is a complex process involving cognitive, emotional and attentional factors. Contributing factors Factors of choking may include, individual responsibility, expectations, poor preparation, self-confidence, physical/mental errors, important games/moments and opponent‚Äôs actions. =Fear of negative evaluation= FNE is a psychological characteristic that increases anxiety under high pressure. Creates apprehension about others' evaluations or expectations of oneself. FNE is similar to motive to avoid failure (MaF). The need to avoid negative evaluation from others, avoid mistakes and avoid negative comparison to other players. =Presence of an audience= The presence of parents, coaches, media or scouts can increase pressure leading to choking. An athlete wants to perform their best while being observed and trying not to make any mistakes increases the amount of pressure they are under. =Self-confidence= Being over-confident can cause negativity to take over quickly. Not expecting something negative to happen can cause a choke. Having low self-confidence leads to more mistakes, because you do not think you can do anything. A study done by Wang, Marchant, Morris and Gibbs (2004) found poor performance associated with high self-conscious individuals. An individual with high self-consciousness focuses their attention to thoughts relating to the task (i.e., ‚Äúdid I step right?‚Äù) and to outside concerns (i.e., ‚Äúwill people laugh if I mess up?‚Äù). Individuals with low self- consciousness can direct their attention outward or inward because self- concerns do not dominate their thinking. =Experience and skill= A study done by Klein Teeselink, Potter van Loon, Van den Assem and Van Dolder (2018) found that professional darts players are substantially less susceptible of choking than amateurs and youngsters. Choking and individual zone of optimal functioning According to the Individual Zones of Optimal Functioning theory (IZOF), proposed by Russian social and sport psychologist Yuri Hanin as an instance of the earlier-discovered Yerkes‚ÄìDodson effect, an individual‚Äôs best performance is when their anxiety level is in a certain zone of optimal state of anxiety or affect. Too much or too little anxiety can lead to performance decrement. Determining athletes‚Äô optimal prestart state anxiety level leads to achieving and maintaining that level throughout the performance. Choking can occur if the athlete is outside their anxiety zone. Programs such as IZOF help identify an athletes anxiety zone creating a balance between arousal and somatic anxiety. Low arousal can lead to broad attention taking in irrelevant and relevant cues. High arousal can create low attention causing important cues being missed. :For example a lacrosse goalie with low arousal may focus more on whether or not a college scout is watching them, rather than focusing on the opponent who is about to score on them. A lacrosse goalie with high arousal may focus more on the opponents stick position instead of the opponent's body position, causing them to step in the wrong direction. Examples of choking in sports =American football= In a Wild Card playoff matchup between the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers on January 3, 1993, the Oilers lost a 32-point lead to lose in overtime, the largest in a playoff game in NFL history. This game is known to this day as The Comeback, or locally in Houston as The Choke. =Association football= The England National Football Team has been noted in the last 30 years especially for their under-performance in major tournaments, and for their lack of success in penalty shootouts. They lost shootouts against Germany in the 1990 World Cup Semi Finals, and in the 1996 European Championship Semi Finals. They lost a shootout against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup Second Round. They then lost two shootouts against Portugal in successive tournaments in 2004 and 2006. Most recently they lost a penalty shootout to Italy in the 2012 European Championships. They have also had notable instances of losing or under- performing in important matches, such as the loss against USA in 1950, surrendering a two-goal lead to West Germany in 1970, drawing against Poland in 1973 when they needed to win to qualify for the World Cup, and losing against Iceland in the 2016 European Championships. In the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final Bayern Munich conceded two goals in injury time to lose 2‚Äì1 to Manchester United. Despite the setback, they went on to win the Champions League two years later. In the 2005 final, AC Milan lost on penalties having led 3‚Äì0 at half-time. The match was dubbed the \\"Miracle of Istanbul\\", with Liverpool scoring three goals in six minutes to draw level. Andriy Shevchenko saw his decisive penalty kick saved by Jerzy Dudek to settle the match. In the first knockout round of the 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Champions League, Paris Saint- Germain F.C. lost a 4-goal aggregate lead to FC Barcelona. PSG had won the first leg at home by 4‚Äì0, and had scored an away goal at the Camp Nou to lead 5‚Äì3 on aggregate after 88 minutes. However, two late goals from Neymar and a stoppage time winner from Sergi Roberto gave Barcelona a 6‚Äì1 win on the night and a 6‚Äì5 triumph on aggregate. Some commentators have called this one of the biggest chokes in footballing history. =Cricket= South Africa suffered upset losses against the West Indies in 1996 and New Zealand in 2011 and 2015. South Africa's win in the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy remains their only international tournament victory to date. In the 2013 Champions Trophy final against India, England batted second and got into a position of needing just 20 runs off the last 16 balls, with six wickets in hand, but lost four wickets in the space of eight balls and lost the match by five runs. =Golf= Greg Norman was leading the 1996 Masters Tournament by six strokes after three rounds, but scored a 6 over par 78 to allow Nick Faldo to win by five strokes, with a 5 under par 67. Jean van de Velde only needed a double-bogey 6 to win the 1999 British Open. Instead he scored a triple-bogey 7 on the 18th hole and entered a play-off which he lost. Rory McIlroy led the 2011 Masters Tournament from the start of the tournament, and led by 4 strokes before the final round, but ended up falling out of the top ten at the tournament, after dropping six shots in three holes in the closing stages. =Ice hockey= Four NHL teams have taken a 3‚Äì0 series lead in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, only to lose 4‚Äì3 in the best-of-seven series: the 1942 Detroit Red Wings, 1975 Pittsburgh Penguins, 2010 Boston Bruins, and 2014 San Jose Sharks. In Game 3 of the first round of the 1982 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the heavily favored Edmonton Oilers, led by NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, lost a 5-0 lead to the Los Angeles Kings. The Kings won 6-5 in overtime and pulled off the stunning upset knocking off the Oilers 3-2. The Kings ended up losing in the second round against the Vancouver Canucks, who advanced to the championship round. =Snooker= Snooker, where a player's nerves are an important aspect of the game, produces many instances where a player fails to close out a match, or are unable to produce on the big stage. Mike Hallett was leading 7-0 and 8-2 in the Masters final, a first to nine frames match against Stephen Hendry, before Hendry came back to win 9-8. Jimmy White reached the final of the World Snooker Championship six times, and lost each time, against Steve Davis, John Parrott and Stephen Hendry. Notably he lost a 14-8 lead to Hendry in 1992, losing 18-14. Two years later he missed a black off its spot in the final and deciding frame to gift Hendry another title. To add insult to injury it was his 32nd birthday on the day. =Tennis= In the 1993 Wimbledon final, Steffi Graf played Jana Novotn√°. After Novotn√° lost the first set, she won 10 of the last 12 games, leading 4-1, serving at 40-30. She then hit the worst 2 serves of her career, and went on to eventually lose 7-6, 1-6, 6-4.

An analysis of tens of thousands of darts matches by Klein Teeselink, Potter van Loon, Van den Assem and Van Dolder (2018) showed that this is a general phenomenon: amateur and youth darts players display a sizable decrease in performance at decisive moments. Professional players, however, were found to be less susceptible to choking under pressure.

Biography Jules was born into a renowned French Jewish military family, the son of Capt. Gaston Moch and R√©becca Alice Pontremoli. His grandfather was Col. Jules Moch. His upbringing occurred during a growing socialist movement in France. He was in Polytechnique along with Alfred Dreyfus. As an engineer (polytechnicien) who took part in the X-Crise Group, he was a socialist member of Parliament for Dr√¥me and then H√©rault from 1928 to 1936 and from 1937 to 1940. He was Under- secretary of State in prime minister L√©on Blum's office (1937) and became Minister of Public Works in 1938. During World War II Moch was critical of the Vichy French Government and was jailed, but later he was released. He joined and helped organize the Paris underground. He also helped other French Resistance activities in France. When The Free French Naval Forces was organized, he rallied to de Gaulle in 1942 and participated in The Invasion of Normandy toward The Free French Liberation of France with The Allied Forces. In Post World War II, Moch was a member of the Consultative Assembly (1944) and of the two Constituent National Assemblies (1945‚Äì46) and then of the National Assembly (1946‚Äì1958 and 1962‚Äì1967). He was eight times Minister during the Fourth Republic: Public works and Transportation (1945‚Äì1947), Interior (1947‚Äì1950), Defence (1950‚Äì1951). As Transport Minister, he contributed to the rebuilding of railways, ports, road, navy and aviation. As Interior Minister, he had to deal with the communist-inspired great strikes in November 1947 and has shown great firmness. In the Defence Ministry, he contributed to the modernisation of the Army, organised French participation in the Korean War and the implementation of NATO. He also suggested and participated in the forming of METO for The Middle East. He fought the gaullist and communist parties during the Fourth Republic and was one of the leaders of the Troisi√®me Force. Jules Moch was deputy prime minister from 1949 to 1950. He was France's delegate at the UN disarmament commission from 1951 to 1960. As rapporteur of the Foreign affairs Committee, he opposed the European Community of Defence that was defeated by the National Assembly in 1954. His last ministerial post was in Pierre Pflimlin's government in May 1958, where he played an important role in the 1958 crisis of French Algeria, as Interior Minister. He left the socialist party in 1975. He was married to Germaine Picard, one of the first early woman lawyers of France and a legal advocate with other renowned supporters in the defence of Alfred Dreyfus (see also The Dreyfus Affair). She was also an active advocate of the women's rights movement in France and Europe. Though other noted individuals lay claim, it is alleged that the name The Cold War was officially \\"coined\\" after a speech he made in 1948, over his concern on the growing rift that developed between the Allied Powers of Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact Forces of Eastern Europe.

Biography The Storost family was a long-established family in East-Prussia and Wilhelm was born in the village of Jonaten (), near Heydekrug, in the Kingdom of Prussia. Wilhelm Storost was the name on his German passport, while Vilimas or Vilius Storostas was the literature Lithuanian form used by himself, his family, and other Lithuanians. \\"Vyd≈´nas\\" was added to his surname as a pseudonym when he was about 40 years old. Storost was married to Klara F√ºllhase. Storost was educated as teacher at the Pr√§parandenanstalt in Pillkallen (1883‚Äì85) and at teacher seminar in Ragnit (1885‚Äì88). From 1888 to 1892 he was a teacher in Kinten (lit. Kintai), when he went to teach at a boys school in Tilsit until 1912 and taught German, French, English, Lithuanian and sports. In 1912 he left his teaching position in order to take up philosophical studies, which he took at the universities of Greifswald, Halle, Leipzig and Berlin. 1918/19 he taught Lithuanian at the Seminar for Oriental Languages in Berlin under the director Eduard Sachau. Back in Tilsit he dedicated himself to reestablishment of Lithuanian Culture, especially folks songs and rural traditions. He directed a choir and wrote songs as well as theater plays. From 1933 on he worked in Memel at the music school. 1932 he wrote a book Sieben Hundert Jahren Deutsch-Litauischer Beziehung (Seven Hundred Years of German-Lithuanian relations). His idea of understanding between folks groups did not please the Nazis and in 1933 the book was outlawed. 1938 he was shortly incarcerated, but because of protests released after two months. Together with nearly all of the people of East Prussia he was expelled during the Soviet take-over and lived in a refugee camp for some time. He died in Detmold, West Germany. His grand nephews, J√ºrgen Storost, recently explained, that Wilhelm Storost's answered his friend Viktor Falkenhahn, that \\"his use of the pen name Vydunas was his chosen anthroposophic mission; that he did not want to be a \\"pavyd≈´nas\\", but a \\"vyd≈´nas\\" (one who wishes everyone everything good). Vyd≈´nas was active in the old Lithuanian pagan religion (see Romuva). However, he never declared the revival of the pagan religion as either his personal goal or a goal of Lithuanians, remaining a national leader but not a religious one. His moral influence transcended the confines of being a typical political leader or a writer at his time. He was compared by later biographers with national leaders in India of his time, such as Rabindranath Tagore or Mahatma Gandhi. Pantheistic universalism, not predefined with participating in any obligatory religious practice, was one of the leading ideas of his philosophy, and gained him later fame as a pioneer of both pagan revival and theosophy in Lithuania. Vyd≈´nas was an ethical vegetarian, and wrote several essays about his ethical choices. (in Lithuanian) Vyd≈´nas was nominated for the Nobel Prize by the Lithuanian Writers Association.

It was operational between 1942 and 1962 and it is currently known as Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome. History =Royal Air Force use= The station was opened in November 1942 as the home of No. 29 Operational Training Unit RAF operating the Vickers Wellington. After the Second World War ended, the airfield was used to test Meteor jet fighters. It was placed into RAF care and maintenance status and remained unused until January 1957.ControlTowers.co.uk Bruntingthorpe =United States Air Force use= On 13 November 1953, control of Bruntingthorpe was allocated to the United States Air Force, however the airfield remained unused for most of the decade.bruntingthorpe.com history In 1955, a massive reconstruction plan was approved to transform the airfield and station into a Strategic Air Command (SAC) bomber base. The USAF planned to use Bruntingthorpe as an advanced \\"Reflex\\" base for forward deployment of the new Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium range nuclear bomber. SAC wanted to disperse its nuclear bomber force and have about half of its B-47s stationed at forward bases in Western Europe and North Africa. Because the borders of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact controlled areas were within the range of the B-47, the \\"Reflex\\" deployments would base the bombers for 90-day rotations of crews and aircraft. Emblem of the 3912th Air Base Squadron Emblem of the 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron The wartime airfield's northeast/southwest runway was widened to 200 feet and increased in length from 6,000 to 10,800 feet in addition to a new parallel taxiway. To accommodate this, thirty-four farmlands were acquired to expand the size of the runway. In addition, a large dispersal area for aircraft parking, an underground refueling pipeline network and also the removal of the wartime crosswind runways. The station area required a large number of administrative and service buildings, a new main hangar, a new control tower and other airfield support buildings. Personnel barracks and other buildings, such as officer housing and, recreation facilities. On 1 March 1957, RAF Bruntingthorpe was activated by Strategic Air Command. The base was placed under the command of the 3912th Air Base Squadron, 7th Air Division.AFHRA document 00425710, 7th Air Division. There is also a reference to the 3912 Air Base Group in Simon Duke's U.S. Military Forces and Installations in Europe, SIPRI, 1989, 315. It says the base was being maintained in the 1980s as a stand-by dispersal site. The first operational use of the base began in March 1958 when 43 B-47s of the 100th Bombardment Wing deployed from Pease AFB, New Hampshire arrived over a three-day period. The squadron participated in operational training missions until returning to the United States in November.AFHRA document 00453769 MANAGEMENT CONTROL DATA, NOV 58 100 BOMBARDMENT WING (BW), OPERATIONS DIRECTIVE 22-58, GRAND SLAM, 1 NOV 58 The 96th Bombardment Wing from Dyess AFB, Texas, deployed its B-47s during the summer of 1959.AFHRA Document 00453105 MESSAGE FROM 15 AIR FORCE, HASKELL GRAY MAINTENANCE EFFECTIVENESS AWARD, 22 JUL 59 96 BOMBARDMENT WING CREW INFORMATION REPORT, JUL 59 MESSAGE, REFLEX TASK FORCE AT BRUNTINGTHORPE, ENGLAND, 31 JUL 59 Following French President General de Gaulle's requirement for all foreign nuclear forces to leave France, there was a major readjustment of USAF deployments in Western Europe, and the B-47 deployments ended. On 1 September 1959, jurisdiction of Bruntingthorpe was transferred from SAC to the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and control of the facility was assigned to the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Alconbury, which had been moved from West Germany to England. The 10th TRW could not accommodate all four squadrons of the wing at Alconbury, so one was based at Bruntingthorpe, which became its satellite. The mission was changed to support Douglas RB-66B Destroyer Reconnaissance aircraft of the 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. The first B-66s arrived at the base on 26 August and by mid-September 18 were present. The squadron's activities consisted of taking high-resolution aerial photographs of Soviet and Warsaw Pact military forces and activities. The 19th TRS remained at Bruntingthorpe for almost three years until the summer of 1962. At that time, it was decided to forward deploy the squadron to the then-unused Toul-Rosi√®res Air Base, France. The first aircraft departed for France on 22 July, with the final aircraft departing by the end of August. With the departure of the B-66s, the USAF turned over control of Bruntingthorpe to the British Ministry of Defence on 28 September, and this ended military use of the facility. Present day With the departure of the USAF, the MoD decided to sell off parts of the facility and to demolish buildings that it judged were no longer of use, or those World War II buildings that remained but were determined to be in a poor condition. Nearly all of the barracks, recreational and social buildings were torn down, along with a World War II hangar. In addition the USAF control tower, the crash and rescue building along with some of the buildings used during Whittle's testing of the Meteor jet during the postwar era were removed. In 1965 a public auction of land formerly used for the USAF support area was conducted. Today, much of the former RAF airfield remains, including the 10,000' runway built in the 1950s. Many dispersal pads for jet bombers remain, the large USAF hangar is still in use, along with the aircraft parking ramp on the south side. The airfield is now known as Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, and was, for a time the home of the only airworthy Avro Vulcan XH558, until the aircraft left at the start of the 2009 display season and is now based at Robin Hood Airport. It is also home to the several aircraft preservation groups including Classic British Jets Collection Buccaneer Aviation Group, Lightning Preservation Group who come together with other groups to present the Cold War Jets Collection Open days.

She saw service in the American Revolutionary War, French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and fought in many of the major naval battles of those conflicts. She is remembered as being Nelson's favourite ship, and was named after the mythical ancient Greek king Agamemnon, being the first ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name. The future Lord Nelson served as Agamemnons captain from January 1793 for 3 years and 3 months, during which time she saw considerable service in the Mediterranean. After Nelson's departure, she was involved in the infamous 1797 mutinies at Spithead and the Nore, and in 1801 was present at the first Battle of Copenhagen, but ran aground before being able to enter the action. Despite Nelson's fondness for the ship, she was frequently in need of repair and refitting, and would likely have been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Sant√≠sima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American waters off Brazil. Her worn-out and poor condition contributed to her being wrecked when in June 1809 she grounded on an uncharted shoal in the mouth of the River Plate, whilst seeking shelter with the rest of her squadron from a storm. All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. In 1993, the wreck of Agamemnon was located, and several artefacts have since been recovered, including one of her cannons. Construction Agamemnon was ordered from the commercial shipbuilder Henry Adams at his Bucklers Hard shipyard on the Beaulieu River on 5 February 1777, to be built to the lines of the , as designed by Sir Thomas Slade. Her keel was laid down in May. She was constructed using timber sourced from the surrounding New Forest. The total cost of her construction was ¬£38,303 15s 4d. She was commissioned on 28 March 1781 under Captain Benjamin Caldwell‚Äîa full 13 days before her launch on 10 April.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 122. A painting of the launch of Agamemnon by Harold Wyllie depicts blue skies and scores of spectators,Goodwin, Nelson's Ships, plate between p. 160 & p. 161. despite the Hampshire Chronicle describing the day as being windy with heavy rain, and with few spectators in attendance. She was named after King Agamemnon, a prominent figure in ancient Greek mythology who participated in the Siege of Troy,Deane, Nelson's Favourite, p. 18. and was the first Royal Navy vessel to bear the name. Lord Nelson regarded her as his favourite ship, and to her crew she was known by the affectionate nickname 'Eggs‚Äìand‚ÄìBacon'.Deane, Nelson's Favourite, p. 77. According to an article in The Gentleman's Magazine, her crew renamed her as they did not like the classical names that were in vogue at the Admiralty during this period (the crews of and also 'renamed' their ships, to 'Billy Ruffian' and 'Polly Infamous' respectively, for the same reason).Deane, Nelson's Favourite, p. 127. American Revolutionary War In November 1781, the Admiralty had received intelligence that a large convoy was preparing to sail from Brest under Admiral de Guichen. The convoy was composed of transports carrying naval supplies for the West Indies and the French fleet in the East Indies. Agamemnon was part of Admiral Richard Kempenfelt's squadron of 18 ships (11 of which mounted 64 or more guns), which he commanded from . Kempenfelt was ordered to intercept the convoy, which he did in the afternoon of 12 December in the Bay of Biscay, approximately south-west of Ushant. With the French naval escort to leeward of the convoy, Kempenfelt attacked immediately, capturing 15 of the transports before nightfall. The rest of the convoy scattered, most returning to Brest; only five transports reached the West Indies.Goodwin, Nelson's Ships, p. 118.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 12. Early in 1782, she sailed to the West Indies as part of Admiral Sir George Rodney's squadron, with Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood as his second in command. On 9 April, the Battle of the Saintes began with an indecisive skirmish, in which the ships of the vanguard division, under Hood's command, were badly damaged and forced to withdraw to make repairs. On 12 April, Agamemnon took part in the second action, which proved much more decisive. Over the course of the battle, Agamemnon had 2 lieutenants and 14 crewmen killed, and 22 others were wounded. After the signing of the Treaties of Versailles brought an end to the Anglo-French War, Agamemnon returned from the West Indies to Chatham, where she was paid off and docked on 29 October 1783 for repairs and to have her copper sheathing replaced. She came out of dock on 4 June 1784, and was subsequently laid up in ordinary. French Revolutionary War =Under Nelson= In anticipation of the start of Britain's involvement in the French Revolutionary War after the execution of King Louis XVI, Agamemnon was recommissioned on 31 January 1793. She was placed under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson, and after provisioning joined the fleet lying at anchor at the Nore. She subsequently sailed to join the Mediterranean fleet under Vice- Admiral Hood, which was blockading the French port of Toulon. On 27 August the town of Toulon declared its allegiance to the Royalist Bourbon cause, and Hood's fleet moved in to take control of the naval dockyard and the 30 French ships of the line that were in the harbour. After capturing 19 of the ships, Agamemnon was sent to Naples to ask King Ferdinand IV for reinforcements with which to secure the town; he agreed to provide 4,000 men. When the revolutionary army, commanded by Napoleon Buonaparte, launched its assault against Toulon, the troops proved insufficient to hold it, and they were forced to abandon the town.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 124. Later in the autumn, Agamemnon fought the inconclusive Action of 22 October 1793 against a French frigate squadron off Sardinia. In April and May 1794, seamen from Agamemnon, led by Nelson, helped capture the Corsican town of Bastia. The French surrendered on 21 May, after a 40-day siege. After this action, Agamemnon was forced to sail to Gibraltar to undergo urgent repairs, the ship having become very worn out after just 16 months at sea, despite having undergone a fairly extensive refit just prior to being recommissioned. Upon completion of her repairs, Agamemnon returned to Corsica, anchoring south of Calvi on 18 June. After Hood arrived with additional ships, Agamemnon contributed guns and men to the 51-day siege of Calvi, during which time Nelson lost the sight in his right eye when a French shot kicked sand and grit into his face. The town surrendered on 10 August, Agamemnon having lost six men in the engagement.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 125.

Agamemnon, still with the Mediterranean fleet‚Äînow under Vice- Admiral William Hotham, who had superseded Hood in December 1794‚Äîparticipated in the Battle of Genoa when a French fleet, comprising 15 ships of the line, was sighted on 10 March 1795. Three days later, the French having shown no signs that they were willing to give battle, Admiral Hotham ordered a general chase.

On 7 July 1795, whilst in company with a small squadron of frigates, Agamemnon was chased by a French fleet of 22 ships of the line and 6 frigates. Due to adverse winds, Admiral Hotham was unable to come to her aid until the following day, and the French fleet was sighted again on 13 July, off the Hy√®res Islands. Hotham signalled for his 23 ships of the line to give chase, and in the ensuing Battle of the Hy√®res Islands, Agamemnon was one of the few Royal Navy ships to engage the enemy fleet. The French ship Alcide struck her colours during the battle, only to catch fire and sink. Many of the other French ships were in a similar condition; Agamemnon and were manoeuvring to attack a French 80-gun ship when Admiral Hotham signalled his fleet to retreat, allowing the French to escape into the Gulf of Fr√©jus. Admiral Hotham was later greatly criticised for calling off the battle, and was relieved as Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean by Admiral Sir John Jervis at the end of the year.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 126. Nelson was promoted to Commodore on 11 March. Shortly thereafter, in the action of 31 May 1796, boats from Agamemnon and Nelson's squadron captured a small convoy of French vessels off the Franco-Italian coast, while suffering minimal casualties. On 10 June 1796 Nelson transferred his pennant to , Captain John Samuel Smith replacing him as Agamemnons commander. Having been deemed in great need of repair, Agamemnon then returned to England. Diagram of the Battle of Copenhagen, showing Agamemnon grounded near the Middle Ground =Mutiny and the Baltic= In May 1797, whilst under the command of Captain Robert Fancourt, Agamemnon was involved in the Nore mutiny. On 29 May, the North Sea squadron lying in the Yarmouth Roads was ordered to sea. Only three ships, , Agamemnon and , obeyed the signal, but Agamemnons crew later mutinied, and sailed the ship back to Yarmouth Roads. The ship was then taken to join the main mutiny at the Nore anchorage, along with , and , arriving on 7 June. After a blockade of London was formed by the mutineers, several ships began to desert the wider mutiny, in many cases being fired upon by the remaining ships. Order was eventually restored aboard Agamemnon when the loyal seamen and marines forcibly ejected the hard-line mutineers from the ship. Captain Fancourt was able to secure a pardon for the remaining ship's company.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 127. On 18 March 1800, Agamemnon was damaged when she ran onto the Penmarks Rocks. She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On her way to port she had encountered , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With the assistance of the crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.322. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p. 327. In response to developments in the Baltic in 1801 that threatened to deprive Britain of much- needed naval supplies, Agamemnon was sent as part of a fleet under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker and Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson to attack the Danish at Copenhagen. On 2 April, Agamemnon was part of Nelson's division that fought the Battle of Copenhagen. Agamemnon was positioned second in the line after , and after passing down the Outer Channel, she grounded whilst attempting to round the southern tip of the Middle Ground shoal. While the battle raged around her Agamemnon, along with and , both of which had also run aground, flew signals of distress. The three stranded ships were eventually pulled off the Middle Ground in the night of 3 April. After the Treaty of Amiens concluded the Revolutionary War, Agamemnon was laid up at Chatham in 1802. Napoleonic Wars Agamemnons general condition in 1802 was so poor that, had hostilities with France not recommenced, she would likely have been hulked or broken up. Instead, after Britain's entry into the Napoleonic Wars, she was brought out of ordinary in 1804, recommissioned under Captain John Harvey on 31 July, and went to join the Channel fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis. Agamemnon was part of Vice-Admiral Robert Calder's fleet cruising off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, when the combined Franco-Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to windward. The British ships formed into line of battle, with Agamemnon fifth in the line, and engaged Admiral Villeneuve's fleet in hazy conditions with light winds. Agamemnon had three men wounded in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and lost her mizzen topmast and the foresail yard. By nightfall, Calder's fleet had become scattered, and he signalled for the action to be discontinued. Ship positions at the beginning of the Battle of Trafalgar. and are erroneously shown in one another's positions =Battle of Trafalgar= On 17 September 1805, after completing a small refit of his ship in Portsmouth, Captain Harvey was superseded in command of Agamemnon by Captain Sir Edward Berry, who had previously commanded Nelson's flagship, , at the Battle of the Nile. On 3 October she departed Spithead to join Vice- Admiral Nelson's fleet blockading Villeneuve's combined fleet in C√°diz. En route, Agamemnon fell in with a French squadron, consisting of six ships of the line and several smaller vessels, which gave chase. Succeeding in evading the French, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron on 13 October, and when Nelson laid eyes on the approaching ship he reportedly exclaimed: \\"Here comes that damned fool Berry! Now we shall have a battle!\\"Deane, Nelson's Favourite, p. 183. In misty conditions on 20 October, Agamemnon captured a large American merchant brig, which she then took in tow. Not long after, signalled to Agamemnon that she was sailing straight towards an enemy fleet of 30 ships‚ÄîVilleneuve's fleet had left port.Deane, Nelson's Favourite, pp. 184‚Äì185. On 21 October 1805 Agamemnon fought in the Battle of Trafalgar. Agamemnon was positioned eighth in Nelson's weather column, with ahead and astern.Deane, Nelson's Favourite, p. 187. Once engaged, she was firing both batteries, eventually pounding the great Spanish four-decker Sant√≠sima Trinidad until that ship was dismasted and, with 216 of her complement dead, struck her colours. Before Berry could take possession of the prize, the enemy van division began bearing down on the British line, having previously been cut off from the battle by Nelson's line-breaking tactics. With Nelson already dying below decks on Victory, Captain of the Fleet Thomas Hardy ordered Agamemnon and several other ships to intercept them. Three of the enemy ships broke off and ran for C√°diz; after briefly engaging Intr√©pide the British ships moved to try to cut off the fleeing ships. Over the course of the battle, Agamemnon suffered just two fatalities, and eight men were wounded.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 128. Following the battle, Agamemnon, despite taking on three feet of water in her hold each hour, took under tow to Gibraltar. After carrying out repairs, the ship rejoined Vice- Admiral Collingwood's squadron, which had resumed the blockade of C√°diz. =Later career= At the beginning of 1806, Agamemnon was with Vice-Admiral Duckworth's squadron in the West Indies, pursuing a French fleet carrying troops to Santo Domingo. On 6 February 1806, the two squadrons clashed in the Battle of San Domingo; Agamemnon assisted Duckworth's flagship in driving the French Vice-Admiral Leiss√®gues' flagship Imp√©rial onto the shore where she was wrecked. In October, Agamemnon escorted a convoy on her return to Britain.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 129. In 1807 Agamemnon was part of Admiral James Gambier's fleet sent to take control of the Danish fleet before it could fall into French hands. She participated in the second Battle of Copenhagen, and as in the first in 1801, ran aground. After she had come free, Agamemnon landed guns and shot in Kj√∂rge Bay to form part of a battery being established there to command the city. Firing commenced on 2 September, and lasted until the Danes surrendered on 7 September. In November, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron off Lisbon. Loss In February 1808, Agamemnon sailed with Rear-Admiral Sir Sidney Smith's flagship to Brazil, where they joined another squadron. At Rio de Janeiro it was discovered that Agamemnon was again quite worn out, with seams in her planking opening and some of her framing bolts broken. In October, Agamemnon and anchored in Maldonado Bay, in the mouth of the River Plate. They had been escorting the merchant vessel Maria, which had carried the surgeon Dr. James Paroissien to Montevideo where he was tasked with exposing a plot against King John VI of Portugal, who was in exile in Brazil. Whilst there, Monarch ran aground, requiring Agamemnons assistance to get her off. After learning that Paroissien had been imprisoned, the two ships put to sea, but were forced to return to Maldonado Bay when they encountered bad weather.Goodwin, Nelson's Ships, p. 128. After the ships returned to Rio in January 1809, the ship was fully surveyed by the carpenter, who drew up an extensive list of her defects. Maldonado and Gorriti Island (right) On 16 June 1809 Agamemnon, along with the rest of the squadron (which was now under the command of Rear-Admiral Michael de Courcy), put into Maldonado Bay for the third and final time, to shelter from a storm.Goodwin, Nelson's Ships, p. 130. While working her way between Gorriti Island and the shore, Agamemnon struck an uncharted shoal. Captain Jonas Rose attempted to use the ship's boats, together with the stream and kedge anchors, to pull the ship off, but to no avail. The ship had dropped anchor on the shoal just previously, and it was discovered that she had run onto it when she grounded, the anchor having pierced the hull. On 17 June, with the ship listing heavily to starboard, Agamemnons stores and all her crew were taken off by boats from other vessels in the squadron, and the following day Captain Rose and his officers left the ship.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 130.Goodwin, Nelson's Ships, p. 131. The court-martial for the loss of Agamemnon was held at Rio de Janeiro on 22 July 1809, aboard . It was found that the ship might have been saved if she had not been in such poor general condition, and Captain Rose was honourably acquitted.Goodwin, The Ships of Trafalgar, p. 131. arrived on 4 August and stayed with the transports Kingston and Neptune as they salvaged what could be salvaged from Agamemnon. Neptune left on 22 September, but Kingston and Nancy stayed as Kingston continued salvage efforts.

It is known to be orbited by two giant planets. Star This star is 24% more massive and 64% larger than our Sun. The total luminosity is 2.96 times that of our Sun and its temperature 5960 K. The age of the star is estimated at approximately 3.7 billion years, with metallicity 1.35 times that of the Sun based on its abundance of iron. Planetary system In April 2001, two giant planets were announced orbiting the star. The first planet HD 74156 b orbits the star at a distance closer than Mercury is to our Sun, in an extremely eccentric orbit. The second planet HD 74156 c is a long-period, massive planet (at least 8 times the mass of Jupiter), which orbits the star in an elliptical orbit with a semimajor axis of 3.90 astronomical units. =Claims of a third planet= Given the two- planet configuration of the system under the assumption that the orbits are coplanar and have masses equal to their minimum masses, an additional Saturn- mass planet would be stable in a region between 0.9 and 1.4 AU between the orbits of the two known planets. Under the \\"packed planetary systems\\" hypothesis, which predicts that planetary systems form in such a way that the system could not support additional planets between the orbits of the existing ones, the gap would be expected to host a planet. In September 2007, a third planet with a mass at least 0.396 Jupiter masses was announced to be orbiting between planets b and c with an eccentric orbit. The planet, orbiting in a region of the planetary system previously known to be stable for additional planets, was seen as a confirmation of the \\"packed planetary systems\\" hypothesis. However, Roman V. Baluev has cast doubt on this discovery, suggesting that the observed variations may be due to annual errors in the data. A subsequent search using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope also failed to confirm the planet, and further data obtained using HIRES instrument strongly contradicts its existence.

In order theory, a branch of mathematics, the least fixed point (lfp or LFP, sometimes also smallest fixed point) of a function from a partially ordered set to itself is the fixed point which is less than each other fixed point, according to the set's order. A function need not have a least fixed point, and cannot have more than one. For example, with the usual order on the real numbers, the least fixed point of the real function f(x) = x¬≤ is x = 0 (since the only other fixed point is 1 and 0 < 1). In contrast, f(x) = x+1 has no fixed point at all, let alone a least one, and f(x)=x has infinitely many fixed points, but no least one. Applications Many fixed-point theorems yield algorithms for locating the least fixed point. Least fixed points often have desirable properties that arbitrary fixed points do not. In mathematical logic and computer science, the least fixed point is related to making recursive definitions (see domain theory and/or denotational semantics for details). Immerman N. Immerman, Relational queries computable in polynomial time, Information and Control 68 (1‚Äì3) (1986) 86‚Äì104. Revised version in Information and Control, 68 (1986), 86‚Äì104. and Vardi independently showed the descriptive complexity result that the polynomial-time computable properties of linearly ordered structures are definable in FO(LFP), i.e. in first-order logic with a least fixed point operator. However, FO(LFP) is too weak to express all polynomial-time properties of unordered structures (for instance that a structure has even size). Examples Let G=(V,A) be a directed graph and v be a vertex. The set of nodes accessible from v can be defined as the set S which is the least fixed-point for the property: v belongs to S and if w belongs to S and there is an edge from w to x, then x belongs to S. The set of nodes which are co- accessible from v is defined by a similar least fix-point. On the one hand the strongly connected component of v is the intersection of those two least fixed-point. Let G be a proper context-free grammar. The set E of symbols which produces the emptyword is defined as the least fixed-point which contains the symbols S such that S rightarrow varepsilon, or such that S rightarrow S^0,dots,S^n where all symbols S^i belongs to E. Greatest fixed points Greatest fixed points can also be determined, but they are less commonly used than least fixed points. However, in computer science they, analogously to the least fixed point, give rise to corecursion and codata.

HD 82943 is estimated at roughly 1.15 times the mass of the Sun.  Planetary system  The first planet discovered (designated HD 82943 b) was announced in 2000 by a team of French astronomers led by Michel Mayor. The planet orbits its parent star at a mean distance of 1.19 astronomical units (AU) and taking approximately 441 days to complete the orbit. Nearly a year later, a second planet (designated HD 82943 c) was announced by the same discoverers of the previous planet. This planet orbits closer than the other, at a mean distance of 0.746 AU and taking 219 days to complete its orbit. The two known planets appear to have a 2:1 resonance with one another. Further radial velocity analysis hinted at either long-period stellar activity or presence of a third Jovian planet with an orbital period of 1075 days. Announced in 2001, HD 82943 was found to contain an unusually high amount of lithium-6. Stars do not naturally contain lithium-6, but unlike stars, planets never reach temperatures that are high enough to burn their initial content of lithium-6 (planets should retain lithium-6). The simplest and most convincing answer to explain this observation is that one or more planets, or at least planetary material, have fallen into the star, sometime after it passed through its early evolutionary stage.

The heads of these royal houses held the title of , regardless of their genealogical distance from the reigning Emperor, as the term sesh≈´ in their designation meant that they were eligible for succession. History The Imperial family of Japan considers itself a single dynasty in unbroken succession; however, the succession has often not been directly from father to son, but has been in the male line within a closely related group of people. In the Muromachi period, Prince Yoshihito, the son of the Northern Emperor Suk≈ç was permitted to establish a parallel lineage to the main imperial line, and took the name Fushimi-no-miya from the location of his palace. Without this permission, the line would be considered commoners, and therefore excluded from the succession. This served politically to cement the reunification of the Northern and Southern Court, but provided insurance in the extreme event that the main imperial line should fail to produce a direct heir and become extinct. This proved to be a fortunate decision, as in 1428, the son of the 2nd Prince Fushimi-no-miya ascended the throne as Emperor Go-Hanazono. In the Edo period, three additional sesh≈´ shinn≈çke households were created by the Tokugawa shogunate, in conscious imitation of the Tokugawa Gosanke. However, aside from Emperor Go-Hanazono, the only time a member of the sesh≈´ shinn≈çke ascended to the throne was in 1779, when the son of Prince Kan'in-no-miya Sukehito became Emperor K≈çkaku. Within the sesh≈´ shinn≈çke households, younger non-heir sons (who were titled ), had two career options. They could \\"descend\\" to subject status with a surname such as Minamoto or Taira, and serve as a government official, or they could enter the Buddhist priesthood, generally as the head of one of the monzeki temples in and around Kyoto. During the Edo period, the latter practice became almost universal. Non-heir sons who entered the priesthood were styled , and were automatically excluded from the succession, but could be recalled to \\"secular\\" status (and thus reinstated as potential successors) if the need arose. Unwed daughters, once they crossed a certain age, often became Buddhist nuns. However, marriage was the norm for them, and they could hope to enter the highest houses of the land. The great sesh≈´ shinn≈çke houses gave their daughters in marriage only to families of high rank, such as the kuge, daimy≈ç or Tokugawa houses, if not to the imperial family. During and after the Meiji Restoration, members of the sesh≈´ shinn≈çke, whether they were elder sons or younger sons, often served in the Imperial Japanese Army or Imperial Japanese Navy. The four sesh≈´ shinn≈çke lineages The four sesh≈´ shinn≈çke were, in order of creation: # Fushimi-no-miya # Katsura-no-miya (extinct) # Arisugawa-no-miya (extinct) # Kan'in-no-miya (extinct) The Katsura-no-miya and Arisugawa-no-miya houses died out in 1881 and 1913, respectively. The sixteenth son of Prince Kuniie, the twentieth head of the Fushimi-no-miya, succeeded to the Kan'in-no-miya house in 1872, but the house died out in 1988 on the death of his son. The Fushimi-no-miya house was the progenitor of nine other cadet branches of the imperial family, the ≈çke, during the reign of Emperor Meiji. After the 25th Fushimi-no-miya, the \\"seshu shinn≈çke\\" ceased to exist.

They came up with a futuristic design with an 18,500 seater single tier kop. The design was estimated to cost ¬£400m, and the club were granted planning permission for this stadium. Work never started on this as the owners Hicks and Gillette couldn't raise the funds. In January 2008, AFL presented Liverpool FC with another redesign of their 60,000 capacity stadium. This was dubbed \\"New Generation Anfield\\" and would seat 73,000 with 18,500 in a single tiered kop, similar to the HKS capacity. The stadium would also include two Wembley-style arches.http://aflarch.demonweb.co.uk/projects.php?action=showProject&catID;=43&projectID;=227 It would cost ¬£290m to build. Planning permission has not been sought for this project however. In January 2012, the Telegraph reported that the new club owners Fenway Sports Group had decided to ditch the HKS design on the bases of cost and practicality and focus on working with AFL's \\"First Generation Anfield\\" plans. They would modernise the now decade-old design, and include a single tiered kop. It was thought that at least ¬£150m in sponsorship money would have had to have been raised before construction could begin. The current owners announced the expansion of Liverpool's current stadium. Work began on the project in 2015. History Liverpool F.C. were approached by Liverpool City Council to become a tenant on the flagship King's Dock project. The club however rejected the offer because the site would only be suitable for a 50,000 capacity stadium. At the same time, Merseyside rivals Everton F.C. informally inquired about building on North West section of Stanley Park, Liverpool but were deterred when told that a Victorian covenant was in place. Liverpool's then CEO, Rick Parry threatened to move Liverpool into a neighbouring borough on Merseyside because the only other site he considered viable was to become a residential estate in Garston. The City Council then offered Everton F.C. the opportunity to become tenants of King's Dock. Everton agreed to this as they would only need to raise ¬£30million for a 55,000 capacity stadium and the rest would be paid for with public money by the Council. Sensing an opportunity, former chief executive Rick Parry told Liverpool City Council that Liverpool F.C. wanted to build on the South East area of Stanley Park and that they were considering leaving the city boundaries and taking millions of pounds of income that would usually be paid to the council with them. The City Council reluctantly agreed to Parry's demands and Parry told the press that the solution was \\"under our noses all along\\". At the time, Everton chairman, Bill Kenwright chose not to contest the reasoning because they were being given financial support from the public sector. Plans to build on Stanley Park were resisted by local residents and Friends of Stanley Park who did not want to lose parkland for a football stadium. The stadium designed by AFL was given planning permission in February 2003. Construction was expected to be finished in 2006. =Hicks & Gillett Era= In February 2007 the club was bought by American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr. The new owners stated that a new stadium was a priority and that work would begin soon. However the pair failed to secure funding for the stadium, and the AFL plans were replaced by newer and more expensive HKS ones. The HKS stadium was given final planning permission on 19 June 2008 and minor site preparation began on 24 June 2008.Work starts on Reds ground On 15 May, Carlsberg stated their interest in a sponsorship deal of the stadium name, proposing Carlsberg Anfield. No official deal was signed however, and thus no major financial backing was secured. Former Liverpool Chief Executive Rick Parry announced on 5 October 2008 that although the stadium would still be built, work would be delayed until economic conditions improve. =Fenway Sports Group Era= By mid-2010 the club were in serious financial trouble with huge debts. This prompted the takeover of the club by a consortium led by John W Henry in October 2010. The group known as New England Sports Ventures (now Fenway Sports Group) announced that the club wanted to expand stadium capacity, and that they would reexamine all options, including redeveloping Anfield.[{cn}} FSG permanently ditched the more expensive HKS stadium designs in favour of a revised AFL design that would conform with the original planning permission. In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that the owners of Liverpool FC had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost in the region of ¬£150m. Groundshare with Everton FC It was reported that, should funding prove sufficiently difficult to acquire, there was a possibility that the stadium would be co-financed by Everton FC, who were also looking into the possibility of a new stadium in Kirkby, although this had been strenuously denied by Liverpool's former co- owner Tom Hicks. Due to the government's rejection of Everton FC's stadium project and financial problems at Everton FC, there had been speculation in the media as to a joint stadium project. Such a project received support from the leader of Liverpool city council and the chief of Liverpool's bid to host matches as part of the failed English 2018 World Cup bid. Despite media rumours, Liverpool FC always maintained that a ground sharing situation was never on the agenda. This idea was quashed once Liverpool F.C. completed their new Main Stand, removing the need for a potential new stadium. Access =Anfield Railway Station= In February 2008, it was revealed that Liverpool FC were looking to build a new rail station. Three locations have been looked at; Utting Avenue, Stanley Park Avenue and Pinehurst Avenue.

Governor General of Algeria, he helped the rise of Charles de Gaulle to the presidency of the Fifth Republic, but broke with De Gaulle over Algerian independence, joined the OAS in their efforts to overthrow De Gaulle and lived in exile between 1961 and 1968. On returning to France he resumed political and academic activity and was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1983.  Biography  Jacques Soustelle was born in Montpellier, into a Protestant working-class family. A brilliant high school student, he was admitted to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure de la rue d'Ulm, which is still a major college within the French educational system (many Nobel Prize winners and Fields Medalists are among its alumni). At the age of 20, he was admitted at the first place at the competitive exam of agr√©gation de philosophie (high-level grade for teaching). An anti-fascist, he was general-secretary in 1935 of the French Union of Intellectuals against Fascism. = Anthropology of Mesoamerica = Soustelle developed an interest in Ethnology while working at the Mus√©e de l'Homme under Paul Rivet. Rivet sent him to Mexico, after Soustelle became an Agr√©g√©, to study the Otomi people. Soustelle wrote his first major book Mexique, Terre Indienne (Mexico is Indian) about his time with the Otomi. = France Libre = After the Armistice of 22 June 1940, he left Mexico to join the Free French Forces (FFL) in London. Charles de Gaulle charged him of a diplomatic mission in Latin America (1941), to set up support committees to free France, to cut short the diplomatic efforts of Petainists throughout the continent. He headed the intelligence service Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action (BCRA). He joined the Comit√© national fran√ßais, (Government of the Free France, fighting Vichy France, and the Axis powers ) in London, then ran the commissariat national √† l‚ÄôInformation (1942). Appointed to head the Special Services Branch (DGHS) in Algiers in (1943‚Äì1944) by the French Committee of National Liberation), He was Commissioner of the Republic (prefect) in Bordeaux then in the Liberation deputy of Mayenne. = Reconstruction of France = In 1945, he served first as Minister of Information, then as Minister of the Colonies. From 1947 to 1951, he served as Secretary General of the Gaullist party Rassemblement du Peuple Fran√ßais (RPF) and was one De Gaulle's closest counsellors. = Algeria = He was nominated Governor General of Algeria by Pierre Mend√®s France in 1955‚Äì56, favouring the integration of the Muslim community in the French Departments along the Mediterranean coast. Thanks to Soustelle's support during the May 1958 Algiers revolt, De Gaulle returned to power. Though he believed he would become Algeria Secretary, Soustelle was only named Information Minister in June 1958. In 1959, he was appointed Minister of State in charge of Overseas Departments by De Gaulle. He was unharmed after three Front de Lib√©ration Nationale (FLN) terrorists attempted to assassinate him by shooting his car on the Place de l'√âtoile in Paris. He asked De Gaulle for a presidential pardon for the only attacker who had been arrested and sentenced to death. Soustelle disagreed with De Gaulle's sudden turn for Algerian independence. He analyzed this turnaround in his book L'Esp√©rance Trahie (Broken Hope). Soustelle was dismissed from the cabinet and the Gaullist party Union pour la nouvelle R√©publique (UNR) in 1960 and joined the terrorist Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS) in the fight against the independence of Algeria. When the OAS was replaced by the Conseil National de la R√©sistance (CNR), he joined this new organization with Georges Bidault, former President of the World War II National Council of the Resistance. His activities led him to being sued for attempting to undermine the authority of the French state. He lived in exile between 1961 and his 1968 amnesty. =National Assembly= Soustelle was elected to France's National Assembly (France's lower House) three times, first representing Mayenne in 1945‚Äì46, then the Rh√¥ne (1951‚Äì58) as a Gaullist, and from 1973 to 1978 as a member of the centrist Mouvement R√©formateur. In 1974, he supported the bill legalizing abortion presented by Simone Veil. He died, aged 78, in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

Their patrol areas may be coastal sea waters, rivers, estuaries, harbors, lakes, canals or a combination of these. Duties and functions Water police are usually responsible for ensuring the safety of water users, enforcing laws relating to water traffic, preventing crime on vessels, banks and shores, providing search and rescue services (either as the main provider or as an initial response unit before more specialized units arrive), and allowing the police to reach locations not easily accessible from land. They may also be responsible for coastal security, environmental law enforcement, immigration and smuggling patrols, and diving search operations (although many police organizations have separate units to handle this). Their operations may coordinate with other agencies with similar assets such as in the United States the various Federal, State or Local authorities may work together to promote or achieve similar enforcement or rescue outcomes.

These cartridges are often created in order to optimize a certain performance characteristic (such as the power, size or efficiency) of an existing commercial cartridge. Developing and using wildcat cartridges does not generally serve a purpose in military or law enforcement; it is more a hobby for serious shooting, hunting, gunsmithing and handloading enthusiasts, particularly in the United States. There are potentially endless varieties of wildcat cartridge: one source of gunsmithing equipment has a library of over 6,000 different wildcat cartridges for which they produce equipment such as chamber reamers. Development of a wildcat Often, wildcats are commercially sold rounds that have been modified in some way to alter the cartridge's performance. Barrels for the caliber are originally manufactured by gunsmiths specializing in barrel making. Generally the same makers also offer reloading dies, tools to custom-load bullets into cases. Because changing the barrel of a gun to accommodate custom cartridges requires precision equipment, most wildcats are developed by or in association with custom barrel makers. Ammunition is handloaded, using modified parent cases and the gunsmith-provided wildcat dies. Generally the supplier of the barrel or dies will also provide the buyer with basic reloading data, giving a variety of powders, charge weights, and bullet weights that can be used for developing loads. Handloaders use the data to develop a load by starting with minimum loads and carefully working up. Wildcat cases and cartridges can be found for sale, but only from small makers. Larger manufacturers usually do not produce wildcats because there is such a limited market for them and because there are no established CIP (Commission Internationale Permanente Pour L'Epreuve Des Armes A Feu Portatives - Permanent International Commission for the Proof of Small Arms) or SAAMI standards, which causes liability concerns. Wildcat goals and methods From left to right: cross sectioned and normal .338 Yogi wildcat cartridge cases compared to a factory .338 Lapua Magnum case. Wildcat cartridges are developed for many reasons. Generally, the goal is to optimize some characteristic of a commercial cartridge in a given context. Higher velocities, greater energy, better efficiency, greater consistency (which yields greater precision) and complying to a minimal permitted caliber or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game in a particular jurisdiction are the top reasons. The sport of metallic silhouette shooting, has given rise to a great number of wildcats, as several rifle rounds are adapted to fire from a handgun. In using autopistols for hunting or competitive shooting, improved feeding of softnose or hollowpoint bullets is also an issue; the bottlenecked .45/38, for instance, was created because the straight-cased .45 ACP had trouble feeding hollowpoints.Barnes, Frank C. Cartridges of the World (Northfield, Illinois: DBI, 19776), p. 140, \\".45-38 Auto Pistol\\". Wildcat cartridges are generally developed because: * Higher velocities can be obtained by increasing the case capacity, or reducing the caliber. * Greater energy can be attained by increasing the caliber or the case capacity. * Better efficiency can be achieved by increasing the shoulder angle, shortening the case, and reducing case taper (see internal ballistics). * Greater consistency can be achieved by tuning the case capacity to a certain bullet diameter, weight, and velocity that give consistent results. * Feeding problems can be fixed. Some methods used to develop a wildcat are: * Cold forming. The parent case is well lubricated and forced carefully into the reloading die for the wildcat caliber. This will swage the case into the new shape. This type of operation is used for reducing case dimensions, such as changing the neck diameter or pushing the shoulder back. *Fire forming. This consists of taking the parent case, or a partially cold formed case, loading it with a light bullet and light load of powder, and firing it in the firearm it will be used in. Another technique uses a charge of fast burning powder topped with a case full of Cream of Wheat and a wad, to form a special blank cartridge that will expand the case. This technique is used for increasing case dimensions, such as pushing the neck forward, increasing the neck angle, or straightening the case walls.Case-Forming Top Contender Hunting Loads, Performance Shooter, May 1997; includes information on cold forming and fire forming, including the \\"Cream of Wheat\\" fire forming method. * Trimming to length. Generally, after either a cold forming or a fire forming operation, the mouth of the case will be longer than ideal, and the case will be trimmed back to the \\"trim to\\" length. Trimming is a normal reloading operation, as high pressure cartridges will flow each time they are fired, and periodically need trimming to remove the brass that flows to the mouth. * Changing the diameter of the case (to suit a new caliber). Called \\"necking up\\" or \\"necking down\\", this is the most common way of making a wildcat. The new caliber allows a much different range of bullet weights, and can greatly increase the velocity or the power or the resistance to wind drift as compared to the parent cartridge. * Necking back. This is a cold forming operation in which the neck is pushed back to reduce case capacity. This is often done when developing rounds for shorter barrels, such as turning a rifle cartridge into a handgun cartridge. * Blowing out. This is a fire forming operation that moves the shoulder forward to increase case capacity. * Changing the shoulder angle. By making the shoulder closer to square, the resulting space is closer to the ideal spherical shape, resulting in a more efficient burn. If the shoulder is also to be moved back, this is a cold forming operation; if the shoulder is to stay or be moved forward, it is a hot forming operation. * Reducing the case taper. This hot forming operation makes the cartridge more cylindrical, giving similar results to a shoulder angle change. * Changing the rim. While this is a wildcatting operation, it is generally only done by commercial operations, due to the precision turning needed. Generally this is a conversion from rimmed to rimless cartridge, or from rimless to rebated, and is done to allow a larger parent case than the firearm action was designed for. The opposite operation, adding a rim to a case, is also generally only done by major manufacturers; examples are the .45 Auto Rim, a rimmed .45 ACP allowing ejection in .45 revolvers without the use of moon clips, and the .307 Winchester, a rimmed .308 Winchester, developed for use in lever-action rifles. A handloader can add a rim, by swaging a ring of metal onto a rimless case, then turning it down, but this is very labor-intensive process and requires a special swaging die and precision metalworking lathe. It is far easier for most handloaders to simply start with a rimmed case, either of the desired diameter or reamed out as desired. *Increasing the case length. This process (which allows the cartridge to contain more propellant and thus increases potential energy of the bullet) was used to make the powerful .357 Magnum cartridge from the much weaker .38 Special: A .357 magnum bullet has more than 3 times more energy than a .38 special bullet of the same weight. Increasing the length of a bullet's case usually involves getting rid of the old case and making a completely new one from scratch, which all but limits the feasibility of this kind of modification to commercial manufactures. It is possible to draw an existing case into a slightly longer form, thinning and stretching the existing case, but this is an operation requiring special equipment and expertise. It is far easier and more common to reduce, not extend the length of a case. Example wildcat cartridges In terms of sheer numbers of varieties, there are more wildcat cartridges than there are production cartridges. Most wildcats are custom made, and therefore are not generally well-known. Some wildcat cartridges, however, are produced commercially in small quantities by small manufacturers. This is a list of some representative wildcats. * .30 Herrett. Based on the .30-30 Winchester, necked back and with a sharper shoulder angle. Developed for use in pistols with barrels as short as 10 inches (25 cm), it develops the same power as a .30-30 with greater efficiency and less muzzle blast. * .357 Herrett. Like the earlier .30 Herrett, this cartridge is based on the .30-30 Winchester, shortened and necked up to .357 (9 mm). Designed for use in short barrels, the resulting cartridge is more efficient and more powerful than the .30-30. Often considered one of the best medium game hunting calibers available in the 10\\" (25 cm) barrelled Thompson Center Arms Contender pistol. * .10 Eichelberger Long Rifle. This is one of a smaller number of wildcats based on rimfire cartridges. It is made by disassembling a .22 Long Rifle cartridge, and re- using the case. The .10 caliber (2.5 mm) is the smallest rifled barrel made. The tiny .10 caliber bullets produce almost no recoil and travel at very high velocities. While it can be used on small game at short ranges, this cartridge is more of a curiosity than a practical hunting or target round.AmmoGuide.com, free registration may be required. * 5.7 MMJ, or 5.7mm Spitfire. A .30 Carbine case necked down to .223 caliber (5.56 mm), this cartridge was developed to convert military surplus M1 Carbines into short range varmint guns. *6mm PPC. Based on the .220 Russian, which is in turn based on the 7.62√ó39mm intermediate-power cartridge. The 6mm PPC was developed in 1975 specifically for benchrest shooting. While it is anything but common anywhere else, the 6mm PPC unseated the .222 Remington from its 20-year spot as the best benchrest cartridge available. Chambered only in single-shot rifles due to its short, fat case and sharp shoulder angle, the 6mm PPC is still going strong in benchrest after 30 years. * .22 Eargesplitten Loudenboomer. This humorously named cartridge was developed by P. O. Ackley specifically to exceed muzzle velocity. Based on a .378 Weatherby Magnum case, the case is impractically overpowered for the bore diameter, and so the cartridge remains a curiosity. * 7 mm TCU (also known as 7TCU). Based on the .223 Remington case, the 7 mm TCU is popular in single-shot handguns such as the Thompson Center Arms' Contender and G2 Contender. It is but one of a family of wildcat TCU cartridges. =Wildcat cartridges in Australia= In Australia, wildcat cartridges were relatively common. Most are made primarily for hunting species such as deer, kangaroo, are generally based on the .303 British because of the post war popularity of that round and of the cheap surplus Australian Lee‚ÄìEnfield MkIII military rifles available. Many of these surplus rifles were rebarreled to .257 caliber, known as the 303-25. One of the unique features is that these cartridges relied less on handloading - and instead factory ammunition was produced by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI and Sportco. Since having an existing barrel rebored and rechambered was (at that time) less expensive than fitting a new barrel, a 303-25 rifle with a worn out barrel could be economically converted to .277 caliber, known as the 303-270. The .222 Remington - a .222 Rimmed in a Martini was also commonly found. As too were the \\"Tini-Mite\\" and \\"Mini-Mite\\" cartridges, .17 caliber rimfire cartridges based on the .22 Long Rifle case. =Commercially accepted wildcats= Some cartridges started out as custom-made (non-commercially developed) wildcats, and gained wide enough acceptance or popularity to become commercial cartridges. Generally, cartridges become popular commercially after a commercial firearms maker begins offering a weapon chambered in the cartridge. Once popular enough, funding is generated for SAAMI standards development. After SAAMI standards are in place, any firearms or ammunition maker can be sure that any products manufactured to the SAAMI standards can be safely used. Some examples of custom cartridges that became commercially accepted are: *.22-250. Based on a .250 Savage case, the .22-250 is still one of the fastest shooting .22 caliber (5.56 mm) cartridges available. First offered in a factory firearm by Browning in 1963 (the first factory gun chambered for a wildcat), the .22-250 was later adopted by Remington as the .22-250 Remington. *.22 CHeetah. A .308 BR (Bench Rest) case necked down to .22 caliber, the .22 CHeetah provides a flat trajectory with a .22 caliber bullet that has a relatively high speed of 4,000 ft/s. Hard on barrels, it provides a very effective 300 yard varmint round.Cartridges of the World p. 188. *.303/25. A .303 British cartridge necked down to fire a .25 calibre projectile, developed in Australia during the 1940s as a Kangaroo culling and pest control round. Popularised in the late 1940s and 1950s in New South Wales, owing to restrictions in that state on ownership of .303 British calibre firearm and the difficulties of obtaining commercial hunting arms and ammunition from overseas. Now largely obsolete, but there are still large numbers of converted Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles chambered for this round in Australia. *6.8 mm SPC. This cartridge was developed by American military special operations soldiers in search of a more lethal round than the 5.56√ó45mm NATO. It is based on the .30 Remington cartridge necked down to .270 caliber, and sized to fit in the M16 rifle. The 6.8 SPC is currently deemed unlikely for official military adoption, but is fielded by special operations troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and is gaining popularity as a commercial round. *7 mm-08. A .308 Winchester necked down to 7 mm (.284 caliber), the 7 mm-08 provides a flatter trajectory with lighter, more aerodynamic 7 mm bullets. *7-30 Waters. Designed to improve the performance of lever-action rifle designs dating back to the 1890s, the 7-30 Waters is a .30-30 Winchester necked down to 7 mm (.284 caliber). Even with the lower chamber pressures allowed by the lever-action rifle and the flat tipped bullets necessitated by the tubular magazines, the 7-30 Waters offers a significant gain in velocity and sectional density with little loss in bullet weight. This cartridge has also developed a following among handgun hunters using single-shots such as the T/C Contender or G2, which can take advantage of spitzer (pointed) bullets that are unsafe in tubular magazines. It is very efficient on small to medium- sized game including whitetails and mule deer. *.454 Casull. This magnum revolver cartridge, a lengthened .45 Colt, was developed by Dick Casull and Jack Fulmer in 1957 as a high-powered big game hunting round. For many years, the small Wyoming manufacturer Freedom Arms was the only substantial maker of guns for the cartridge. In the mid-1990s, two major manufacturers, Ruger and Taurus, started selling guns chambered in .454 Casull because it was popular due to its extreme power. It was finally commercialized in 1998, when SAAMI published its first standards for the cartridge. =Commercially developed wildcats= Though a cartridge technically has to not be developed commercially to be considered a wildcat, some commercial cartridges were developed by ammunition and firearm manufacturers by modifying existing cartridges ‚Äì using essentially the same process used to make wildcats. Cartridges that are modified by being made longer (usually to make them more powerful) are for the most part only created commercially because of the difficulty of the process. One example of such a cartridge is the .357 Magnum, which was developed from the .38 Special in 1934 by firearms manufacturer Smith & Wesson. * .38-40. One of the oldest wildcats, the .38-40, introduced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1874, was made by necking down a .44-40. Actually a .401 in (10.2 mm)Barnes, Frank C., ed. by John T. Amber. Cartridges of the World (Northfield, Illinois: DBI Books, 1972), p.67. cartridge, the .38-40 had faded into obsolescence before being revived with the growing popularity of Cowboy action shooting. The ballistics of the .38-40 are close to those of the .40 S&W.; * .221 Fireball. This cartridge was developed by Remington Arms for the XP-100 pistol, which was a single shot bolt action pistol. The .221 Fireball was a necked back .222 Remington, designed for greater efficiency in the 10 in (25 cm) barrel of the XP-100. Even loaded with a smaller load of faster powder for the short barrel, the .221 Fireball lived up to its name, with a massive muzzle flash; the performance, however, was unheard of for its day: over 2700 feet per second (885 m/s) out of the short XP-100 barrel. It remains the fastest SAAMI approved handgun cartridge, and the cartridge is so efficient and accurate that it has been chambered in rifles as well. * .22 Remington Jet. This cartridge was developed by Remington for a Smith & Wesson Model 53 revolver and a Marlin Model 62 lever-action rifle, but the rifle was never produced in this calibre. The .22 Remington Jet was a necked down .357 Magnum case.Barnes, Frank C., ed. by John T. Amber. Cartridges of the World (Northfield, Illinois: DBI Books, 1972), p.148, \\".22 Remington Jet\\". The .22 Jet is no longer manufactured by Remington or other commercial manufacturers. * .357 SIG. This now-popular pistol cartridge was developed by Swiss weapons company Sig Sauer in an attempt to produce ballistics matching the powerful .357 Magnum revolver load, but in a semi-automatic pistol cartridge. The cartridge was made by necking down and slightly stretching the .40 S&W; case, which itself derived from the 10mm Auto. * .400 Corbon. This cartridge was designed to produce 10mm Auto ballistics in a cartridge that could be chambered in a .45 ACP pistol with a simple barrel swap. It was made by necking a .45 ACP down to .40 (10 mm). Initially, no firearms were available in .400 Cor-Bon, but barrels in the new caliber were produced for the M1911 pistol. * .41 Action Express. Developed in 1986 by Action Arms for the Jericho 941 pistol. It, like the .357 SIG, attempted to make a magnum-power cartridge for a semi-automatic pistol. It started with a .41 Magnum case and cut it down to fit in a semi-automatic pistol chambered for 9√ó19mm. The rim was then turned down to the same dimensions as the 9√ó19mm, making it a rebated rim cartridge. This allowed a unique switch up to a larger caliber. The .41 AE never saw huge commercial success because of the creation of the similarly-powerful .40 S&W; in 1990. * .204 Ruger. Introduced in 2004 by Ruger, in its time it held the title of fastest production cartridge with a velocity of 4225 ft/s (1290 m/s) with a , .204 bullet from a barrel. Intended as a varmint rifle cartridge, the .204 was based on the .222 Remington Magnum, which is slightly longer than the .223 Remington and offers about 5% more case capacity. Designed to have a very long point blank range, the factory loading offers impressive ballistics, 1.5 inches high at , and low at . =Second (and later) generation wildcats= Some wildcats are based not on commercial rounds, but on other successful wildcats. The .308 √ó 1.5\\" Barnes, a wildcat from noted cartridge author Frank Barnes made by simply necking a .308 Winchester back to in length (38.1 mm) is probably the best example of a wildcat that has spawned many other successful wildcats. The .308 x 1.5\\" case is available from a number of case manufacturers, and differs from a homemade .308 x 1.5\\" in that it has a small primer pocket, where the original .308 Winchester case has a larger primer pocket (the smaller primer is more suited to the smaller case capacity of the short round). There are at least 8 wildcats that are made from the small primer .308 x 1.5\\" brass, including some very successful benchrest rounds, including the Benchrest Remington family of cartridges, .22 BR, 6mm BR, 6.5mm BR, 7mm BR, .30 BR. Another example is the .220 Russian, based on the 7.62√ó39mm. Since nearly all 7.62√ó39mm ammunition made in the 1970s used the complex-to-reload Berdan priming, and often steel cases, it made a poor choice for wildcatting. The .220 Russian, however, was and still is readily available in Boxer-primed, brass cases of high quality. The .220 Russian is still the parent cartridge of choice for the PPC line of cartridges, such as the .22 PPC and 6mm PPC, even though there are far more PPC chambered firearms available than .220 Russian chamberings. Likewise, the PPC line of cartridges were the parent case of the 6.5 Grendel, a long-range, high-energy cartridge for the AR-15.

For Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the mod also serves as a derivative engine to Rockstar's interpretation of RenderWare.  History  = Background = The release of Grand Theft Auto III, a critically acclaimed sandbox-style action-adventure computer and video game developed by DMA Design (now Rockstar North) represented the first 3D title in the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series. Despite its success, it was the first Grand Theft Auto game to ship without the network multiplayer gameplay features that were present in earlier titles, which allowed players to connect through a computer network and play the game with others. The first version of Multi Theft Auto, dubbed Grand Theft Auto III: Alternative Multiplayer, attempted to fill in this gap by extending an already existing cheating tool with functionality that allowed the game to be played with a very crude form of two-player racing over a computer network purely as a proof of concept, similar to how the now-defunct XBAND service worked by manipulating game memory in order to add online multiplayer functionality. Newer versions of Multi Theft Auto with increasingly better gameplay and other improvements were released based on the same concept of game manipulation, by a small team of developers. With the introduction of successor Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, it became clear that this computer game title also lacked any form of network gameplay. The Multi Theft Auto software was subsequently extended to include support for this title, and eventually shifted its entire focus towards this title and the concept of a new software framework dubbed Blue. As the original concept (of game manipulation by memory) was prone to various problems with performance and stability that often resulted in application crashes, this new framework was created as a successor and laid the foundation of all future Multi Theft Auto software. = Development = alpha version) The latest Multi Theft Auto version is based on code injection and hooking techniques whereby the game is manipulated without altering any original files supplied with the game. The software functions as a game engine that installs itself as an extension of the original game, adding core functionality such as networking and GUI rendering while exposing the original game's engine functionality through a scripting language. The Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas project was revised and relaunched as an open-source project, leaving all prior versions behind. The source code was licensed under the GPLv3 license and made available on GitHub.  Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas  Multi Theft Auto's latest release is for the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and is built upon a now open source game engine that has been in development for several years and is the only project that is still actively maintained. The engine provides users with all the necessary tools they need to create their own game modes and maps by exposing a large part of the original game functionality through a Lua scripting machine. The initial version of the software was dubbed \\"Race\\" and unveiled on Sunday 22 January 2006, when the first playable content was released. This version featured a networked vehicle racing game mode and a map editor that allowed users to create custom environments and races. The advanced nature of the engine's early incarnation allowed the developers to develop a sophisticated integrated WYSIWYG editor for adding gameplay elements such as checkpoints, spawn points, power-ups and various objects ranging from ramps to exploding barrels. The successor release, dubbed \\"Deathmatch\\", was designed to improve upon \\"Race\\" by providing minimal sandbox style gameplay that could be extended by users and developers. The production on this release started shortly after the initial release, but stagnated due to what is seen as a lack of focus by the development team. As many new features were being introduced, the continuous introduction of these features delayed a stable and final version of the modification. Instead, several on-line facilities were introduced during the development phase to allow visitors to track the development process of the software as changes were made to the code repository, illustrating any notable updates to the progress of the modification. The first \\"Deathmatch\\" successor was introduced as a fully playable version on 2 January 2008 and tagged as \\"Developer Preview\\" to promote the third-party development of custom gameplay content and utilities. This version was followed by a second \\"Developer Preview\\" that introduced several new features and fixes and was subsequently followed by a period of major code restructuring that led to the open-source relaunch on Friday, 21 November 2008 under the GPLv3 License. On Saturday, 22 August, Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas v1.0 was officially distributed as the first open source release. This release abandoned the now obsolete \\"Deathmatch\\" tag in the product name to emphasize on the versatility of the software. Gameplay functionality is solely provided by the scripting language, so users can choose or develop their own combination of scripts and other contents to customize and host their own type of game. = Content delivery and development = A third-party race track \\"resource\\" in Multi Theft Auto The initial \\"Deathmatch\\" version and its underlying engine presented a series of relevant changes to the functionality of the modification as well as the introduction of an online community content delivery system. Through the use of this website, registered users (such as players, server administrators or developers) can accumulate in-game statistics whilst playing on servers or share custom created content with other users. Third party content is made possible through the addition of the Lua scripting language in both the server hosting the game (e.g. providing functionality for a specific game mode), as well as the client playing the game (e.g. providing a graphical front end or user-specific local content to the game mode). Different scripts can then be run in parallel on either of these, communicating to each other through the use of events. The custom created content is grouped into \\"resources\\" that are hosted server-side. This is a package-based system that packs all script files, custom content (e.g. images, 3D models, textures and collision files) and metadata files inside a single archive or directory. Specific content can then be marked to be uploaded to every connected player, to enable client-side execution of Lua code. This system allows for package dependency and inheritance of functions between different packages, easy management and distribution. = Feature summary = A third-party minigame \\"resource\\" that transforms the game into a poker match. * Multi Theft Auto uses a modular platform to separate several facilities such as the GUI, network, game and scripting code and loads these into the game instead of injecting code into its memory process. This improves stability, speed and allows a better file management. * Uses the freeware CEGUI system, replacing the original Grand Theft Auto GUI, allowing Multi Theft Auto to draw its own widgets for any in- game user interaction such as the server-browser and allows scripting from any third-party resource. * A versatile set of scripting functions. By building upon Grand Theft Auto's own class-based design, implementing this into the client and server and synchronizing between these two, a third-party developer can control almost any aspect of every player's game by means of the Lua scripting language: native elements such as animations, explosions, particles, skins, weapons, vehicles, objects and players, as well as new elements such as custom 3D models are controllable.  Gameplay  Deathmatch, roleplay and race gameplay options are available. Some gameplay elements include checkpoints, spawn points, power-ups, weapons and various objects ranging from ramps to exploding barrels. Many online servers contain custom game modes which use the scripting engine supplied with Multi Theft Auto. As example a few game modes in MTA:SA like Freeroam, where players can roam free in San Andreas all across the map, or competitive game-modes like Race, Destruction/Demolition Derby, Team Deathmatch, and Fallout, where players spawn their characters in the air, on a platform of glass plates, which will suddenly fall down after indicating it, where the players have to jump from a falling piece to an intact one, and the last surviving player wins. The principle of Fallout is similar to Hay, where players have to climb and be on top of a haystack first. The last modes also indicates how many game modes and scripts are possible to create on the MTA scripting engine, with endless possibilities and variation. There are many genres of specific game servers and communities, like real-life role-playing, classic RPGs, and gaming communities that serve a wide variation of different gamemodes, sometimes all together in one server. Today the average amount of game servers the San Andreas version of Multi Theft Auto (MTA:SA) contains, is 3000 to 4000 servers, with over 600,000 players monthly, spread over the servers. The most popular game servers have a constant average of 200 to 1000 online players in- game.  Reception  The Multi Theft Auto project has also been the subject in multiple articles in different media. The most prominent being a coverage on G4 TV,YouTube version of G4TV's MTA fragment. an exclusive release for Fileplanet with coverage on its frontpage,Fileplanet frontpage screenshot. and features in published magazines such as PC Gamer and Total PC Gaming.

Details Edward Brooks was born in Oakley, Buckinghamshire, on 11 April 1883 and baptised in Oakley Church on 20 January 1884. He was one of twelve children of Thomas (born in Oakley in 1855) and Selina Brooks (born in Halesowen, Worcestershire in 1857). He was 34 years old, and a Company Sergeant Major in the 2/4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 28 April 1917 at Fayet, near Saint- Quentin, France, Company Sergeant-Major Brooks, while taking part in a raid on the enemy's trenches, saw that the front wave was being checked by an enemy machine gun. On his own initiative he rushed forward from the second wave, killed one of the gunners with his revolver and bayoneted another. The remainder of the gun crew then made off, leaving the gun, whereupon the company sergeant-major turned it on the retreating enemy, after which he carried it back to Allied lines. His courageous action undoubtedly prevented many casualties and greatly added to the success of the operation. Brooks received his Victoria Cross from the King on 18 July 1917, and on his return to Oxford was met at the railway station by the Mayor and Corporation and driven in a carriage preceded by the Headington Silver Band to Headington. After a presentation at Headington Manor House he returned to his home at 16 Windsor Street. An Oxfordshire blue plaque was unveiled on his Headington home on 29 July 2017.Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board He is also named prominently on the front panel of the plinth unveiled at the new student accommodation in James Wolfe Road, Oxford on 16 August 2019 at the site of Cowley Barracks.

The Prospect Park Zoo is operated by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). In conjunction with the Prospect Park Zoo's operations, the WCS offers children's educational programs, is engaged in restoration of endangered species populations, runs a wildlife theater, and reaches out to the local community through volunteer programs. Its precursor, the Menagerie, opened in 1890. The present facility first opened as a city zoo on July 3, 1935, and was part of a larger revitalization program of city parks, playgrounds and zoos initiated in 1934 by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. It was built, in large part, through Civil Works Administration and Works Progress Administration (WPA) labor and funding. After 53 years of operation as a city zoo run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Prospect Park Zoo, also colloquially known as \\"Brooklyn Zoo\\", closed in June 1988 for reconstruction. The closure signaled the start of a five-year, $37 million renovation program that, save for the exteriors of the 1930s-era buildings, completely replaced the zoo. It was rededicated on October 5, 1993, as the Prospect Park Wildlife Conservation Center, as part of a system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the WCS, all of which are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).  Features  The Prospect Park Zoo is part of the Wildlife Conservation Society, an integrated network of four zoos and an aquarium spread throughout New York City. Located at 450 Flatbush Avenue, across from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the zoo is situated on a plot somewhat lower than street level in Prospect Park. Visitors may enter through the Flatbush Avenue entrance or from within Prospect Park, near Leffert's Homestead and the Carousel. In 2007, 234,000 people visited the Prospect Park Zoo, about the same as the 2006 level of 235,000. , Prospect Park Zoo had 864 animals representing 176 species. =Exhibits= A pair of North American porcupines in a tree. Discovery Trail, World of Animals exhibit at the Prospect Zoo The zoo presents three themed exhibition venues, each housed in a dedicated building. World of Animals The World of Animals in the southern quadrant of the zoo, features the Discovery Trail. The trail begins in the World of Animals building, but visitors quickly pass to an outdoor path that winds through the southern third of the zoo. Animals from diverse corners of the globe are shown in settings not unlike their natural habitats. Visitors may find along the trail black-tailed prairie dogs, porcupines, red pandas, emus, dingos, North American river otters, and other animals. Signs often ask challenging questions, reinforcing presentations made in the zoo's Discovery Center, or alert viewers to look for signs of animal habitation. Along one part of the Discovery Trail, young visitors may crawl through \\"underground burrows\\" to observation posts roofed with clear, hemispherical observation ports. They may observe prairie dogs in the ground, right in the midst of the animals themselves. Animal Lifestyles Animal Lifestyles, in the western quadrant of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors in the foyer of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each diorama holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on pallas cats, cotton-top tamarins, meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals.Exhibit signage, Prospect Park Zoo The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity, a part of the larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society. The foyer of the Animal Lifestyles Building The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit consists of a troop of hamadryas baboons. Zoo visitors may observe the troop in a large glassed-in gallery which looks out into a rocky outcrop. Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather. The rear wall of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other social aspects of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe the troop. Animals in our Lives Animals in our Lives in the northern quadrant of the zoo has both indoor and outdoor exhibits illustrating myriad relationships between animals and people and animal adaptations. The Animals in Art themed area occupies one side of the Animals in Our Lives building. At the art station, drawing supplies are provided, and young visitors learn to observe wildlife by taking the time to sketch it. Some animals found here have been the subjects of art through the ages, while other up-close exhibits highlight the inherent beauty and form of certain species. The other side of the building showcases animals and their adaptations for a variety of survival needs. Here, visitors learn how colors help animals attract one another, blend into their surroundings or send off warning signals. A small nocturnal area showcases animals who have adapted to life at night. A small working barn further north of the building contains the Animals in Our Lives exhibit. It is organized around a working barn with sheep, cows, goats, ducks, geese and other animals. = Educational programs = A red panda at the Prospect Park Zoo. The zoo hosts educational venues as well as exhibits. These revolve around the Discovery Center, a building with classrooms and laboratories designed to introduce school-age children to investigative practices of environmental and wildlife scientists. The Discovery Center introduces children to laboratory practices; they learn about and use professional laboratory equipment and learn how to integrate what they observe into zoological theory. These programs are based on educational concepts developed through WIZE (Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo Education), a program developed by Bronx Zoo educators. The volunteer program at the Prospect Park Zoo engages members of the community; it is a combination outreach and educational program for adults. Volunteer guides conduct tours for visitors, while volunteer docents augment the educational program. Docents enroll in a four-month training program. Following their graduation, docents assist staff in putting on demonstrations and explaining exhibits. = Facilities = The Sea Lion Pool in the center court of Prospect Park Zoo The zoo grounds and building exteriors were designed by Aymar Embury II. The facility consists of six red brick and lime-stoned trimmed buildings grouped in a semi-circular arrangement around a central courtyard with the sea lion pool occupying the center of the court. The building exteriors date to the 1930s while the interiors were built during the 1989-1993 reconstruction. There is a freestanding wooden barn just north of the circular group of buildings. A set of stairs from the main entrance leads visitors down to zoo level. A small restaurant and the administrative center is immediately to the left, occupying the southeastern quadrant of the zoo. The Discovery Center is immediately to the right, occupying the northeastern quadrant of the zoo. Arrayed in front of the visitor are the three exhibit buildings, The World of Animals to the south, the Animal Lifestyles building, behind the sea lion pool directly in front of the visitor, Animals in our Lives is to the right. Visitors may view the exhibits in any order.  History  = Proposal and menagerie = The original 1866 proposal of Prospect Park featured a \\"Zoological Garden\\" on the western flank of the park, near the present Litchfield Villa, but the garden had not been started by the time Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux separated from the park in 1874. This notwithstanding, a few features of the original park design did serve zoological purposes. A Wild Fowl Pond, once occupying the northern quadrant of the zoo grounds, served as a haven for water birds. A Deer Paddock, once occupying the southern quadrants of the zoo grounds, was a penned-in area for deer. In addition, a flock of sheep regularly maintained the grass in the park meadows and were kept in a paddock on the eastern flank of Sullivan Hill, near the now-demolished Dairy Farmhouse. Interest in zoological gardens flowered in the last decade of the 19th century. An informal Menagerie began to take shape within Prospect Park in May 1890 when the newly appointed president of the City of Brooklyn Parks Commission, George V. Brower, donated \\"three young cinnamon bears.\\"References to acquisitions of three cinnamon bears, kept in pens near the Dairy, before dinner at (a then expanded, now demolished) Shelter (Concert Grove) House. State Treasurer Harry Adams followed with a donation of three white deer, establishing a pattern. It was mainly through donations of animals by rich or prominent individuals that the Menagerie grew. By 1893, one observer noted that ‚Äúseven seals arrived, one buffalo, from the estate of Samuel B. Duryea, three red foxes, three bears, one sacred cow, two white deer, five red deer, seven seals, and twelve to fifteen peacocks.\\" The animals were kept in pens on Sullivan Hill, situated across the East Drive from the zoo's present location, near the sheep paddock and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse.Among other changes under way in the last decade of the 19th century, the Deer Paddock from the original park design merged with the Menagerie. The original Deer Paddock became a small meadow. This small meadow was later incorporated into Leffert's Homestead (1918) and the southern part of the present Zoo (1935) In June 1891, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle ran a front page interview with George V. Brower, President of the Parks Commission, referring to the Prospect Park Menagerie still as a contemplated future project. Mr. Brower did say a \\"nucleus\\" had been established, and goes on to inventory the holdings in this nucleus (see reference for details). Of the original zoological facilities in the park, the Deer Paddock, located near the present Carousel, was converted into a meadow and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located on the east side of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century. These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world. A two-story brick building was opened in the Menagerie in 1916, housing monkeys, some small mammals, and several birds. = Modern zoo creation = The California sea lions as feeding time approaches After assuming office in January 1934, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia tapped Robert Moses to head a newly unified Parks Department. Moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct the city's parks, renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools, zoos, playgrounds and parks. Moses acquired substantial Civil Works Administration, and later, Works Progress Administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight-year citywide construction program, relieving some of the high unemployment in New York City in this Depression year. Plans for the new Prospect Park Zoo, prepared by Aymar Embury II, were announced in March 1934. The area between the Wild Fowl Pond and former Deer Paddock on the east side of the park, situated across the East Drive from the Menagerie, was chosen as the site for the new zoo. Architect Embury designed a half circle of six brick buildings centered on a seal pool. Built of red brick with limestone trim, the buildings featured bas-relief scenes from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. Five sculptors executed a total of thirteen such scenes, not only on the front and back walls of zoo buildings, but also on all four sides of both brick entrance shelters at Flatbush Avenue. However, the positioning of some of the bas-reliefs makes them less accessible than others. Dedicated on July 3, 1935, as the Prospect Park Zoo, the buildings constituted an integrated facility and were seen as a great improvement over the somewhat haphazardly developed Menagerie. The zoo featured an extensive bear pit, a seal pool, a lion's house (the current Animals in our Lives building) an elephant's house (the current Animal Lifestyles building) and a house for monkeys, birds, and horned animals (now the World of Animals building). With the completion of the new zoo, The Dairy Farmhouse, sheep paddock, and Menagerie were demolished and the sheep flock was replaced with mechanical mowers. The site of the old Menagerie has since been allowed to revert to forest land. = Decline = For the next fifty years, the zoo served as a showcase of large animals from far away places, appealing to a sense of wonder. An estimated one million people visited the Prospect Park Zoo annually prior to World War II, but attendance gradually declined, reaching about a half million by the early 1980s. Around this time, the facility showed signs of deterioration. Writing in New York Magazine in late 1970, writer Erik Sanberg-Diment termed the zoo the 'rattiest' in New York ‚Äì \\"in the literal sense of the word. (I've never been there without seeing several rodents romping in the bear lair)\\". He reported that \\"Vultch\\", a Southern United States black vulture which was one of the zoo's earliest residents \\"‚Ä¶is still there, looking down his beak at visitors littering the walks, and celebrating his 35th anniversary in the same old cage.\\" A decade later, a New York Times reporter visiting the zoo noted that \\"...an Asiatic Black Bear lay on a rock a short distance from a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'\\" During the 1970s, there were multiple incidents involving animal injuries or deaths at the Prospect Park Zoo. This included the scalding death of a monkey in 1975, allegedly by a zoo employee, as well as an acting zoo director who was accused of shooting at pigeons and killing zoo animals. A zoo employee also locked himself in a monkey enclosure for several hours in 1974 to protest the deaths of ten animals. These incidents, as well as several others at the Central Park Zoo, prompted protests by animal-rights groups who wanted to close the two zoos and move the animals to the larger Bronx Zoo. After fifteen years of sporadic conversations, the Koch administration and the NY Zoological Society (now Wildlife Conservation Society) signed a fifty-year agreement in April 1980, wherein the Central, Prospect, and Queens Zoos would be administered by the Society. Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the \\"10 worst\\" zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. The May 1987 mauling death of Juan Perez, an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit, underscored the difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility. By late summer 1987, an $18-million, 2.5-year renovation plan was put forth to renovate Prospect Park Zoo and coordinate its venue with other facilities to avoid redundant programming. Prospect Park Zoo was slated to specialize in children programs and house smaller, non-aggressive animal species. = Renovation of a re- purposed zoo = The Prospect Park Zoo closed to the public in June 1988. Over the next six months, new homes were found for the displaced animals in other zoos throughout the US. Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989, commencing what became nearly a five-year, $37 million effort, overrunning initial estimates by two years and $19 million.The renovation was originally estimated to cost $18 million dollars and require two and a half years. Reconstruction was complete in April 1993 at a cost reported in the New York Times, of $37 million dollars. The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved, but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted, pits and cages were demolished, and new structures were built. The facilities were turned over to the NY Zoological Society in April 1993. The Society aimed to designate each of its three small zoos with a specific purpose. The Central Park Zoo would be focused toward conservation; the Prospect Park Zoo would be primarily a children's zoo; and the Queens Zoo would become a zoo with North American animals. Black-winged lory at the Prospect Park Zoo A further six months were needed to repopulate the zoo, prepare exhibits, and ready the facility for the public. The re-purposed zoo opened on October 5, 1993, and renamed the \\"Prospect Park Wildlife Conservation Center\\". The Zoological Society hoped that the new name would suggest that the \\"Wildlife Conservation Center\\" was far more than a mere \\"zoo\\"; it was indeed a facility designed to preserve animal species. This name change coincided with the renaming of the zoological society to the \\"Wildlife Conservation Society\\". The programs of the new center were geared toward educating children. Classrooms for the Discovery Center were housed in a dedicated building on the north wing of the zoo. Exhibits housed smaller species, eschewing elephants, tigers, and lions, and augmented displays with interactive exhibits. The public, however, continued to call the facility \\"The Prospect Park Zoo\\", and over the ensuing thirteen years the old name quietly stuck. Even in WCS literature \\"Prospect Park Zoo\\" is now used interchangeably with the new name. =Budget issues= The Wildlife Conservation Society, which supports the Prospect Park Zoo through a combination of private funds and subsidies from the city, is vulnerable to funding shortfalls such as the one on April 15, 2003, when Mayor Michael Bloomberg published his \\"doomsday budget\\" proposal for the fiscal year beginning in July 2003. Among other cuts to help close an overall $3.8 billion budget deficit, the Mayor proposed to cut all city funding for the Prospect Park Zoo and the Queens Zoo, as well as trim funding for the New York Aquarium and the Bronx Zoo. The two zoos were the smallest among the facilities managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society, and had the lowest annual attendance rates, approximately 200,000 for each threatened zoo. In contrast, the Bronx Zoo boasted annual attendance of two million and the Central Park Zoo enjoyed one million visitors annually. Over the next two months, the fate of the two zoos hung in limbo while the city's executive branch and City Council hammered out a compromise budget. While there were a number of items on the budget, the zoo closures remained among the more visible of anticipated losses. In the middle of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and in a press conference outlined some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated expenditure of $8 million, to decommission facilities and ‚Äî on short notice ‚Äî find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates were correct, reasoning went, it would be cheaper to run the zoos than to shut them down. By the start of the new fiscal year in July 2003, the approved budget restored a reduced funding level to the affected WCS facilities. To keep the Prospect Park and Queens Zoos open, the WCS had to close two classroom-based instructional programs, lay off the supporting full- and part-time instructors, and double admission fees. Funding levels for the Wildlife Conservation Society were restored in the 2007 city budget, though vulnerability to shortfalls remain. In the opening months of 2009, the WCS itself faced the prospect of losing its fiscal year 2010 New York State funding. While not citing specifics concerning Prospect Park Zoo, the Wildlife Conservation Society reported in the NY Daily News that the proposed cuts will involve \\"'layoffs [that] would cut across the board,' and include 'front-line workers' in sales, groundskeeping and other positions, and include both union and nonunion positions\\".

Written by local author Neville Smith, who appears as Arthur, the film is set in Liverpool. Albert Finney plays the role of Eddie Ginley, a bingo-caller and occasional club comedian who dreams of being a private eye of the kind he knows from films and pulp novels. Having put an advertisement in a local newspaper (the Liverpool Echo) as a birthday present to himself, Ginley is suddenly contacted for what appears to be an actual piece of detective work. Plot Eddie Ginley (Albert Finney) works at a bingo hall in Liverpool, England, but dreams of becoming a stylish private investigator like those he has read about and seen in films. After finally placing an advertisement in a local newspaper announcing his detective services, he receives a mysterious offer. Even though Ginley is inexperienced and clueless at certain aspects of investigating, he comes to realize that he is entangled in a serious case involving drugs, murder and even his own family. Production The film has many comic moments as it switches between 'straight' detective novel and affectionate spoof. It has some shots of Liverpool buildings that have long since been demolished, including the employment exchange on Leece Street. Several scenes in the London part of the narrative take place in and around the occult Atlantis Bookshop. Gumshoe was the first of two films with original music scores by Andrew Lloyd Webber (the other was The Odessa File, in 1974). Some of the music was re-used in Lloyd Webber's musical version of Sunset Boulevard (1993). Roy Young recorded the song \\"Baby, You're Good For Me\\", written by Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.Soundtrack Credits IMDb.com, accessed 17 May 2017 A scene was significantly (and clumsily) shortened before release because of its detailed depiction of a heroin user preparing and taking his \\"fix\\".

Revolving funds have been used to support both government and non- profit operations. In the case of revolving funds for a government project whose budget goes through annual parliamentary or other legislative appropriations that relate to a fiscal year then the unutilized balance may lapse after the close of the financial year. However it is restored the next year provided the agency concerned includes the amount in next year's appropriation. Within federal and state governments, law establishes revolving funds. Revolving funds, established for the purpose of carrying out specific activities, institute a basis under which financing for the cost of goods or services furnished to or by a government agency originate. Revolving funds are to be replenished through charges made for such goods or services. Revolving funds can be especially valuable for non-profit organizations because they afford both the donor and the non-profit significant advantages. Often a non- profit must announce a program, engage personnel, extend invitations or sign contracts well ahead of raising the donations or receiving the program revenue that will cover the costs. In such cases a revolving fund allows the non- profit to commit to programs early so that it can ensure professional execution and the program's success. The non-profit then can work to generate the revenue, donations, or other support that will repay the money spent. There are several situations in which such funds would be particularly helpful. One example would be funding sources for historic preservation projects. A non-profit preservation organization would establish a fund to receive donations and other capital which is used by the organization to purchase endangered property which is then resold with easements. Some organizations also make loans for building renovations, which then replenish the revolving funds as those loans are repaid. The Providence Revolving Fund is one of the largest local revolving funds in the US. Another example would be a revolving fund established to provide support for programs that require a long-term commitment for planning well ahead of the non-profit's fund-raising cycle. By accessing money in the revolving fund, the non-profit can commit to the project, including signing contracts or issuing invitations, knowing that funding is available from the revolving fund. As the project is funded through donations or through revenue the project may generate, the funds can be repaid to the revolving fund. This ensures the fund is available for future programming. Such a revolving fund offers several advantages to the donor. The donor's commitment is limited and the gift can be restricted for the sole purpose of supporting the program(s) for which it is intended. At the same time the funds committed to a revolving fund may be multiplied several fold as the non-profit repays money it may have taken from the fund. The non-profit will have a great incentive to repay the money to the revolving fund, in order to continue to enjoy the advantages of the revolving fund for future years. United States government According to \\"A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process\\", a revolving fund is established by Congress to finance a cycle of businesslike operations through amounts received by the fund. A revolving fund charges for the sale of products or services and uses the proceeds to finance its spending, usually on a self-sustaining basis.

Early life Makleff was born in the village of Motza, near Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine in 1920. His parents were among the founders of this first modern village outside Jerusalem, located along the road to Jaffa. During the 1929 Palestine riots, inhabitants of the neighbouring Arab village of Qalunya attacked the Makleff home, which was located along the perimeter of Motza, and killed the entire family, except the young Mordechai, who managed to escape the massacre by jumping from a second story window. The murderers included a shepherd employed by the family and the local policeman, who was the only person in the area to own a gun. The murder shocked the Jewish population of Palestine, and was one of the most remembered rioting events. With his immediate family now dead, Mordechai Makleff was raised by relatives in Jerusalem and Haifa. Military career As a teen, Makleff was active in the Haganah and in Orde Wingate's Night Raiders unit. With the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Palestine Regiment of the British Army and fought in the North African and Italian campaigns. He was commissioned from the rank of sergeant in July 1942. Upon his release from the army with the rank of major in August 1946, he remained in Europe, engaged in illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine and acquiring arms for the emerging Jewish state. He later returned to Palestine and rejoined the Haganah. During the 1948 Arab- Israeli War, Makleff fought in the Carmeli Brigade, as its senior operation officer and later as brigade commander, participating in battles near Haifa and Acre. He also took part in Operation Hiram, in which Jewish forces captured the entire Galilee region for Israel. After the war, he headed the Israeli delegation to talks with Lebanon and Syria. In November 1949, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff to Yigael Yadin and senior operations officer of the IDF. Following Yadin's resignation in 1952, Makleff, then just 32 years old, was appointed to replace him as Chief of Staff. He agreed to accept the position for a period of one year only. His tenure as Chief of Staff was marked by his battles with the Ministry of Defence, and in particular with Shimon Peres. David Ben-Gurion commented in his diary \\"I had the clear impression that M. suffered from an inferiority complex and suspected that his authority was being undermined\\". Makleff resigned on 11 October 1953, after repeated demands that relations between the army and the Ministry of Defence be reformed.Peri, Yoram (1983) Between battles and ballots. Israeli military in politics. Cambridge University Press. . Pages 196,197. During that time, Israel was faced with increasing attacks from fedayeen, Palestinian raiders from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who attacked Israeli border settlements. In response to this, Makleff appointed Major Ariel Sharon to form a commando unit to attack the fedayeen bases across the border and put an end to the attacks on Israeli civilians. Sharon, in turn, created Unit 101, which conducted a lengthy series of retaliatory raids throughout 1953, when it was merged into the Paratroopers Brigade. He was also responsible for the establishing of Unit 131 which set up clandestine cells in Arab states to be activated in the event of war. A year later, the cell in Egypt was exposed in events that led to the Lavon Affair.Peri. Page 237. Civilian career On 7 December 1953, exactly one year after he assumed the position, Maklef resigned as Chief of Staff. He went on to serve in a number of key positions in the Israeli public sector. From 1955 to 1968, he was Director General of the Dead Sea Works, developing the local phosphate industry in that region.

Born in Dunedin, Brown was a farmer when the First World War began. In late 1915, he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and was posted to the 2nd Battalion, the Otago Infantry Regiment. He saw action on the Western Front, and was awarded the VC for his actions during the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette in September 1916. As he was killed several days later during the Battle of Le Transloy, the award was made posthumously. His VC was the second to be awarded to a soldier serving with the NZEF during the war and was the first earned in an action on the Western Front. Early life Donald Forrester Brown was born on 23 February 1890 in Dunedin, New Zealand. He was one of 10 children of Robert Brown, a draper living in Oamaru, and his wife Jessie . His parents were migrants from Scotland who had married in New Zealand. The youngest boy in his family, Brown was educated at South School and, later, Waitaki Boys' High School in Oamaru. After completing his schooling he took up farming, and by 1913 had purchased a farm at Totara, south of Oamaru. First World War When the First World War broke out, Brown continued to work on his farm for a year but then sold it and volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) on 19 October 1915. He received his training at Trentham Military Camp and embarked for the Middle East in January 1916 with the Ninth Reinforcements. By this time he had been promoted to corporal. The newly formed New Zealand Division was training in Egypt and when Brown arrived, he was posted to the 2nd Battalion, Otago Infantry Regiment. Within a few months he was on the Western Front in France with the rest of the division. On arrival in France, the New Zealanders were assigned to the Armenti√®res sector of the Western Front. This area was considered to be a \\"nursery\\" sector, for introducing inexperienced troops to the Western Front. Brown's battalion was initially positioned to the east of Armenti√®res. Despite being a quiet part of the front, it was still exposed to artillery and sniper fire. The battalion rotated regularly in and out of the front line, as it gained experience in trench warfare. In August 1916, the division began transferring to the Somme sector. The next month, Brown, by now a sergeant, was involved in the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette, part of the Somme Offensive. On the opening day of the battle, 15 September, the 2nd Otago Battalion, alongside the 2nd Auckland Battalion, had to capture a series of German-held trenches from their position south-east of High Wood. The advance commenced at 6:20 am. While the first trench was easily captured with the assistance of effective artillery support, his company came under heavy flanking machine gun fire while advancing to the next trench, which caused many casualties in the company. Brown, together with another soldier, Corporal Jesse Rodgers, attacked one machine gun post, killing the crew and capturing the gun. The remaining soldiers regrouped and prepared for an attack on the next trench. During a covering artillery barrage they once again came under fire from a machine gun post. Brown was amongst those who attacked this second machine gun post, swiftly dealing with the threat. Once the covering barrage lifted, the New Zealanders advanced and captured their next objective, a position known as Switch Trench, by 7:00 am. Some tanks were supposed to have been assisting the infantry but these never appeared. Brown was key in immediately improving the existing defences in preparation against a possible counterattack, by digging new trenches for shelter should Switch Trench be targeted by German artillery. The following day, his battalion was relieved and withdrew from the front line. Brown's company lost 123 men from its initial complement of 180 during the opening day of the battle. After a period of rest, Brown's battalion moved back into the front line on the evening of 28 September. It was to be one of the assaulting battalions involved in an attack to clear out a German trench system near Eaucourt L'Abbaye as part of the Battle of Le Transloy that commenced on 1 October. On the opening day of the battle, Brown was again involved in the seizing of a German machine gun post at a strongpoint that was holding up the advance. Moving forward on his own, armed only with a pistol, Brown attacked the post. He managed to kill its crew and capture the gun which allowed his fellow troops to attack and capture the strongpoint. While firing at German soldiers as they fled, Brown was shot in the head by a sniper and killed instantly. Victoria Cross Brown's grave at Warlencourt British Cemetery Brown's company commander had recommended him for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions on 15 September. In a letter to Brown's father, his battalion commander hoped that the recommendation would be upgraded to a Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The senior leadership of the NZEF were slow to recognise Brown's gallantry and it was not until the officers of his battalion lobbied for a VC nomination that any progress was made. The award of the VC to Brown was gazetted on 15 June 1917. The citation read: Brown's VC was only the second to be awarded to a soldier of the NZEF and the first as a result of an action on the Western Front. Arthur Foljambe, the 2nd Earl of Liverpool and New Zealand's Governor General, duly presented the VC to Brown's father in a ceremony at Oamaru on 30 August 1917. The medal remains in the possession of his family but it has been loaned for display at Waitaki Boys' High School, the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru and the North Otago Museum. Brown is buried at Warlencourt British Cemetery, France. A memorial tablet in his honour was unveiled in the Oamaru Municipal Chambers on 27 October 1917. In 1919, as part of an effort to recognise men from North Otago who had been killed in the war, an oak tree was planted in his memory in Oamaru. There is also a plaque honouring him in Queen's Garden in Dunedin.

The work of a force acting on a particle as it moves along a displacement is different for different displacements. Among all the possible displacements that a particle may follow, called virtual displacements, one will minimize the action. This displacement is therefore the displacement followed by the particle according to the principle of least action. The work of a force on a particle along a virtual displacement is known as the virtual work. Historically, virtual work and the associated calculus of variations were formulated to analyze systems of rigid bodies,C. L√°nczos, The Variational Principles of Mechanics, 4th Ed., General Publishing Co., Canada, 1970 but they have also been developed for the study of the mechanics of deformable bodies.Dym, C. L. and I. H. Shames, Solid Mechanics: A Variational Approach, McGraw-Hill, 1973.  History  The principle of virtual work had always been used in some form since antiquity in the study of statics. It was used by the Greeks, medieval Arabs and Latins, and Renaissance Italians as \\"the law of lever\\". The idea of virtual work was invoked by many notable physicists of the 17th century, such as Galileo, Descartes, Torricelli, Wallis, and Huygens, in varying degrees of generality, when solving problems in statics. Working with Leibnizian concepts, Johann Bernoulli systematized the virtual work principle and made explicit the concept of infinitesimal displacement. He was able to solve problems for both rigid bodies as well as fluids. Bernoulli's version of virtual work law appeared in his letter to Pierre Varignon in 1715, which was later published in Varignon's second volume of Nouvelle m√©canique ou Statique in 1725. This formulation of the principle is today known as the principle of virtual velocities and is commonly considered as the prototype of the contemporary virtual work principles. In 1743 D'Alembert published his Trait√© de Dynamique where he applied the principle of virtual work, based on Bernoulli's work, to solve various problems in dynamics. His idea was to convert a dynamical problem into static problem by introducing inertial force.Ren√© Dugas, A History of Mechanics, Courier Corporation, 2012 In 1768, Lagrange presented the virtual work principle in a more efficient form by introducing generalized coordinates and presented it as an alternative principle of mechanics by which all problems of equilibrium could be solved. A systematic exposition of Lagrange's program of applying this approach to all of mechanics, both static and dynamic, essentially D'Alembert's principle, was given in his M√©canique Analytique of 1788. Although Lagrange had presented his version of least action principle prior to this work, he recognized the virtual work principle to be more fundamental mainly because it could be assumed alone as the foundation for all mechanics, unlike the modern understanding that least action does not account for non-conservative forces. Overview If a force acts on a particle as it moves from point A to point B, then, for each possible trajectory that the particle may take, it is possible to compute the total work done by the force along the path. The principle of virtual work, which is the form of the principle of least action applied to these systems, states that the path actually followed by the particle is the one for which the difference between the work along this path and other nearby paths is zero (to first order). The formal procedure for computing the difference of functions evaluated on nearby paths is a generalization of the derivative known from differential calculus, and is termed the calculus of variations. Consider a point particle that moves along a path which is described by a function mathbf{r}(t) from point A, where mathbf{r}(t=t_0), to point B, where mathbf{r}(t=t_1). It is possible that the particle moves from A to B along a nearby path described by mathbf{r}(t) + delta mathbf{r}(t), where delta mathbf{r}(t) is called the variation of mathbf{r}(t). The variation delta mathbf{r}(t) satisfies the requirement delta mathbf{r}(t_0) = delta mathbf{r}(t_1) = 0. The scalar components of the variation delta r_1(t), delta r_2(t) and delta r_3(t) are called virtual displacements. This can be generalized to an arbitrary mechanical system defined by the generalized coordinates q_i, i = 1,2,...,n. In which case, the variation of the trajectory q_i(t) is defined by the virtual displacements delta q_i, i = 1,2,...,n. Virtual work is the total work done by the applied forces and the inertial forces of a mechanical system as it moves through a set of virtual displacements. When considering forces applied to a body in static equilibrium, the principle of least action requires the virtual work of these forces to be zero.  Introduction  Consider a particle P that moves from a point A to a point B along a trajectory r(t), while a force F(r(t)) is applied to it. The work done by the force F is given by the integral : W = int_{mathbf{r}(t_0)=A}^{mathbf{r}(t_1)=B}mathbf{F}cdot dmathbf{r} = int_{t_0}^{t_1}mathbf{F}cdot frac{dmathbf{r}}{dt}~dt = int_{t_0}^{t_1}mathbf{F}cdot mathbf{v}~dt, where dr is the differential element along the curve that is the trajectory of P, and v is its velocity. It is important to notice that the value of the work W depends on the trajectory r(t). Now consider particle P that moves from point A to point B again, but this time it moves along the nearby trajectory that differs from r(t) by the variation Œ¥r(t)=Œµh(t), where Œµ is a scaling constant that can be made as small as desired and h(t) is an arbitrary function that satisfies h(t0) = h(t1) = 0. Suppose the force F(r(t)+Œµh(t)) is the same as F(r(t)). The work done by the force is given by the integral :bar{W} = int_{mathbf{r}(t_0)=A}^{mathbf{r}(t_1)=B}mathbf{F}cdot d(mathbf{r}+epsilon mathbf{h})=int_{t_0}^{t_1}mathbf{F}cdot frac{d(mathbf{r}(t)+epsilonmathbf{h}(t))}{dt}~dt=int_{t_0}^{t_1}mathbf{F}cdot (mathbf{v}+epsilon dot{mathbf{h}})~dt . The variation of the work Œ¥W associated with this nearby path, known as the virtual work, can be computed to be : delta W = bar{W}-W = int_{t_0}^{t_1}(mathbf{F}cdot epsilondot{mathbf{h}})~dt. If there are no constraints on the motion of P, then 6 parameters are needed to completely describe P's position at any time t. If there are k (k ‚â§ 6) constraint forces, then n = (6 - k) parameters are needed. Hence, we can define n generalized coordinates qi (t) (i = 1, 2, ..., n), and express r(t) and Œ¥r=Œµh(t) in terms of the generalized coordinates. That is, :mathbf{r}(t) = mathbf{r}(q_1,q_2,...,q_n;t), :mathbf{h}(t) = mathbf{h}(q_1,q_2,...,q_n;t). Then, the derivative of the variation Œ¥r=Œµh(t) is given by : frac{d}{dt}delta mathbf{r} = frac{d}{dt}epsilonmathbf{h} = sum_{i=1}^nfrac{partial mathbf{h}}{partial q_i}epsilondot{q}_i, then we have : delta W = int_{t_0}^{t_1}left(sum_{i=1}^n mathbf{F}cdotfrac{partialmathbf{h}}{partial q_i}epsilondot{q}_iright)dt = sum_{i=1}^nleft(int_{t_0}^{t_1}mathbf{F}cdotfrac{partialmathbf{h}}{partial q_i}epsilondot{q}_i ~dtright). The requirement that the virtual work be zero for an arbitrary variation Œ¥r(t)=Œµh(t) is equivalent to the set of requirements : Q_i = mathbf{F}cdot frac{partial mathbf{h}}{partial q_i} = 0, quad i=1, ldots, n. The terms Qi are called the generalized forces associated with the virtual displacement Œ¥r.  Static equilibrium  Static equilibrium is a state in which the net force and net torque acted upon the system is zero. In other words, both linear momentum and angular momentum of the system are conserved. The principle of virtual work states that the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all virtual movements of the system from static equilibrium. This principle can be generalized such that three dimensional rotations are included: the virtual work of the applied forces and applied moments is zero for all virtual movements of the system from static equilibrium. That is : delta W = sum_{i=1}^m mathbf{F}_i cdot deltamathbf{r}_i + sum_{j=1}^n mathbf{M}_j cdot deltamathbf{phi}_j = 0 , where Fi , i = 1, 2, ..., m and Mj , j = 1, 2, ..., n are the applied forces and applied moments, respectively, and Œ¥ri , i = 1, 2, ..., m and Œ¥œÜj , j = 1, 2, ..., n are the virtual displacements and virtual rotations, respectively. Suppose the system consists of N particles, and it has f (f ‚â§ 6N) degrees of freedom. It is sufficient to use only f coordinates to give a complete description of the motion of the system, so f generalized coordinates qk , k = 1, 2, ..., f are defined such that the virtual movements can be expressed in terms of these generalized coordinates. That is, : delta mathbf{r}_i (q_1, q_2, ..., q_f; t), quad i = 1, 2, ..., m ; : deltaphi_j (q_1, q_2, ..., q_f; t), quad j = 1, 2, ..., n . The virtual work can then be reparametrized by the generalized coordinates: : delta W = sum_{k=1}^f left[ left( sum_{i=1}^m mathbf{F}_i cdot frac{partial mathbf{r}_i}{partial q_k} + sum_{j=1}^n mathbf{M}_j cdot frac{partial mathbf{phi}_j}{partial q_k} right) delta q_k right] = sum_{k=1}^f Q_k delta q_k , where the generalized forces Qk are defined as : Q_k = sum_{i=1}^m mathbf{F}_i cdot frac{partial mathbf{r}_i}{partial q_k} + sum_{j=1}^n mathbf{M}_j cdot frac{partial mathbf{phi}_j}{partial q_k} , quad k = 1, 2, ..., f . KaneT. R. Kane and D. A. Levinson, Dynamics: theory and applications, McGraw- Hill, New York, 1985 shows that these generalized forces can also be formulated in terms of the ratio of time derivatives. That is, : Q_k = sum_{i=1}^m mathbf{F}_i cdot frac{partial mathbf{v}_i}{partial dot{q}_k} + sum_{j=1}^n mathbf{M}_j cdot frac{partial mathbf{omega}_j}{partial dot{q}_k} , quad k = 1, 2, ..., f . The principle of virtual work requires that the virtual work done on a system by the forces Fi and moments Mj vanishes if it is in equilibrium. Therefore, the generalized forces Qk are zero, that is : delta W=0 quad Rightarrow quad Q_k = 0 quad k =1, 2, ..., f . = Constraint forces = An important benefit of the principle of virtual work is that only forces that do work as the system moves through a virtual displacement are needed to determine the mechanics of the system. There are many forces in a mechanical system that do no work during a virtual displacement, which means that they need not be considered in this analysis. The two important examples are (i) the internal forces in a rigid body, and (ii) the constraint forces at an ideal joint. Lanczos presents this as the postulate: \\"The virtual work of the forces of reaction is always zero for any virtual displacement which is in harmony with the given kinematic constraints.\\" The argument is as follows. The principle of virtual work states that in equilibrium the virtual work of the forces applied to a system is zero. Newton's laws state that at equilibrium the applied forces are equal and opposite to the reaction, or constraint forces. This means the virtual work of the constraint forces must be zero as well.  Law of the lever  A lever is modeled as a rigid bar connected to a ground frame by a hinged joint called a fulcrum. The lever is operated by applying an input force FA at a point A located by the coordinate vector rA on the bar. The lever then exerts an output force FB at the point B located by rB. The rotation of the lever about the fulcrum P is defined by the rotation angle Œ∏. This is an engraving from Mechanics Magazine published in London in 1824. Let the coordinate vector of the point P that defines the fulcrum be rP, and introduce the lengths : a = mathbf{r}_A - mathbf{r}_P, quad b = mathbf{r}_B - mathbf{r}_P, which are the distances from the fulcrum to the input point A and to the output point B, respectively. Now introduce the unit vectors eA and eB from the fulcrum to the point A and B, so : mathbf{r}_A - mathbf{r}_P = amathbf{e}_A, quad mathbf{r}_B - mathbf{r}_P = bmathbf{e}_B. This notation allows us to define the velocity of the points A and B as : mathbf{v}_A = dot{theta} a mathbf{e}_A^perp, quad mathbf{v}_B = dot{theta} b mathbf{e}_B^perp, where eA‚ä• and eB‚ä• are unit vectors perpendicular to eA and eB, respectively. The angle Œ∏ is the generalized coordinate that defines the configuration of the lever, therefore using the formula above for forces applied to a one degree-of-freedom mechanism, the generalized force is given by : Q = mathbf{F}_A cdot frac{partialmathbf{v}_A}{partialdot{theta}} - mathbf{F}_B cdot frac{partialmathbf{v}_B}{partialdot{theta}}= a(mathbf{F}_A cdot mathbf{e}_A^perp) - b(mathbf{F}_B cdot mathbf{e}_B^perp). Now, denote as FA and FB the components of the forces that are perpendicular to the radial segments PA and PB. These forces are given by : F_A = mathbf{F}_A cdot mathbf{e}_A^perp, quad F_B = mathbf{F}_B cdot mathbf{e}_B^perp. This notation and the principle of virtual work yield the formula for the generalized force as : Q = a F_A - b F_B = 0. The ratio of the output force FB to the input force FA is the mechanical advantage of the lever, and is obtained from the principle of virtual work as : MA = frac{F_B}{F_A} = frac{a}{b}. This equation shows that if the distance a from the fulcrum to the point A where the input force is applied is greater than the distance b from fulcrum to the point B where the output force is applied, then the lever amplifies the input force. If the opposite is true that the distance from the fulcrum to the input point A is less than from the fulcrum to the output point B, then the lever reduces the magnitude of the input force. This is the law of the lever, which was proven by Archimedes using geometric reasoning.  Gear train  A gear train is formed by mounting gears on a frame so that the teeth of the gears engage. Gear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, this provides a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next. For this analysis, we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the input gear. Illustration from Army Service Corps Training on Mechanical Transport, (1911), Fig. 112 Transmission of motion and force by gear wheels, compound train The size of the gears and the sequence in which they engage define the ratio of the angular velocity œâA of the input gear to the angular velocity œâB of the output gear, known as the speed ratio, or gear ratio, of the gear train. Let R be the speed ratio, then : frac{omega_A}{omega_B} = R. The input torque TA acting on the input gear GA is transformed by the gear train into the output torque TB exerted by the output gear GB. If we assume, that the gears are rigid and that there are no losses in the engagement of the gear teeth, then the principle of virtual work can be used to analyze the static equilibrium of the gear train. Let the angle Œ∏ of the input gear be the generalized coordinate of the gear train, then the speed ratio R of the gear train defines the angular velocity of the output gear in terms of the input gear, that is : omega_A = omega, quad omega_B = omega/R. The formula above for the principle of virtual work with applied torques yields the generalized force : Q = T_A frac{partialomega_A}{partialomega} - T_B frac{partial omega_B}{partialomega}= T_A - T_B/R = 0. The mechanical advantage of the gear train is the ratio of the output torque TB to the input torque TA, and the above equation yields : MA = frac{T_B}{T_A} = R. Thus, the speed ratio of a gear train also defines its mechanical advantage. This shows that if the input gear rotates faster than the output gear, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And, if the input gear rotates slower than the output gear, then the gear train reduces the input torque.  Dynamic equilibrium for rigid bodies  If the principle of virtual work for applied forces is used on individual particles of a rigid body, the principle can be generalized for a rigid body: When a rigid body that is in equilibrium is subject to virtual compatible displacements, the total virtual work of all external forces is zero; and conversely, if the total virtual work of all external forces acting on a rigid body is zero then the body is in equilibrium. If a system is not in static equilibrium, D'Alembert showed that by introducing the acceleration terms of Newton's laws as inertia forces, this approach is generalized to define dynamic equilibrium. The result is D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work, which is used to derive the equations of motion for a mechanical system of rigid bodies. The expression compatible displacements means that the particles remain in contact and displace together so that the work done by pairs of action/reaction inter- particle forces cancel out. Various forms of this principle have been credited to Johann (Jean) Bernoulli (1667‚Äì1748) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700‚Äì1782). =Generalized inertia forces= Let a mechanical system be constructed from n rigid bodies, Bi, i=1,...,n, and let the resultant of the applied forces on each body be the force-torque pairs, Fi and Ti, i=1,...,n. Notice that these applied forces do not include the reaction forces where the bodies are connected. Finally, assume that the velocity Vi and angular velocities œâi, i=,1...,n, for each rigid body, are defined by a single generalized coordinate q. Such a system of rigid bodies is said to have one degree of freedom. Consider a single rigid body which moves under the action of a resultant force F and torque T, with one degree of freedom defined by the generalized coordinate q. Assume the reference point for the resultant force and torque is the center of mass of the body, then the generalized inertia force Q* associated with the generalized coordinate q is given by : Q^* = -(Mmathbf{A})cdot frac{partial mathbf{V}}{partial dot{q}} - ([I_R]alpha+ omegatimes[I_R]omega)cdot frac{partial vec{omega}}{partial dot{q}}. This inertia force can be computed from the kinetic energy of the rigid body, : T = frac{1}{2}Mmathbf{V}cdotmathbf{V} + frac{1}{2}vec{omega}cdot [I_R]vec{omega}, by using the formula : Q^* = -left(frac{d}{dt} frac{partial T}{partial dot{q}} -frac{partial T}{partial q}right). A system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates has the kinetic energy :T = sum_{i=1}^n(frac{1}{2}Mmathbf{V}_icdotmathbf{V}_i + frac{1}{2}vec{omega}_icdot [I_R]vec{omega}_i), which can be used to calculate the m generalized inertia forcesT. R. Kane and D. A. Levinson, Dynamics, Theory and Applications, McGraw-Hill, NY, 2005. : Q^*_j = -left(frac{d}{dt} frac{partial T}{partial dot{q}_j} -frac{partial T}{partial q_j}right),quad j=1, ldots, m. =D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work= D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system. Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that : delta W = (Q_1 + Q^*_1)delta q_1 + ldots + (Q_m + Q^*_m)delta q_m = 0, for any set of virtual displacements Œ¥qj. This condition yields m equations, : Q_j + Q^*_j = 0, quad j=1, ldots, m, which can also be written as : frac{d}{dt} frac{partial T}{partial dot{q}_j} -frac{partial T}{partial q_j} = Q_j, quad j=1,ldots,m. The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system. If the generalized forces Qj are derivable from a potential energy V(q1,...,qm), then these equations of motion take the form : frac{d}{dt} frac{partial T}{partial dot{q}_j} -frac{partial T}{partial q_j} = -frac{partial V}{partial q_j}, quad j=1,ldots,m. In this case, introduce the Lagrangian, L=T-V, so these equations of motion become : frac{d}{dt} frac{partial L}{partial dot{q}_j} -frac{partial L}{partial q_j} =0 quad j=1,ldots,m. These are known as Lagrange's equations of motion. Virtual work principle for a deformable body Consider now the free body diagram of a deformable body, which is composed of an infinite number of differential cubes. Let's define two unrelated states for the body: * The boldsymbol{sigma} -State : This shows external surface forces T, body forces f, and internal stresses boldsymbol{sigma} in equilibrium. * The boldsymbol{epsilon} -State : This shows continuous displacements mathbf {u}^* and consistent strains boldsymbol{epsilon}^* . The superscript * emphasizes that the two states are unrelated. Other than the above stated conditions, there is no need to specify if any of the states are real or virtual. Imagine now that the forces and stresses in the boldsymbol{sigma} -State undergo the displacements and deformations in the boldsymbol{epsilon} -State: We can compute the total virtual (imaginary) work done by all forces acting on the faces of all cubes in two different ways: * First, by summing the work done by forces such as F_A which act on individual common faces (Fig.c): Since the material experiences compatible displacements, such work cancels out, leaving only the virtual work done by the surface forces T (which are equal to stresses on the cubes' faces, by equilibrium). * Second, by computing the net work done by stresses or forces such as F_A , F_B which act on an individual cube, e.g. for the one-dimensional case in Fig.(c): : F_B left( u^* + frac{ partial u^*}{partial x} dx right ) - F_A u^* approx frac{ partial u^* }{partial x} sigma dV + u^* frac{ partial sigma }{partial x} dV = epsilon^* sigma dV - u^* f dV :where the equilibrium relation frac{ partial sigma }{partial x}+f=0 has been used and the second order term has been neglected. :Integrating over the whole body gives: :int_{V} boldsymbol{epsilon}^{*T} boldsymbol{sigma} , dV ‚Äì Work done by the body forces f. Equating the two results leads to the principle of virtual work for a deformable body: :mbox{Total external virtual work} = int_{V} boldsymbol{epsilon}^{*T} boldsymbol{sigma} dV qquad mathrm{(d)} where the total external virtual work is done by T and f. Thus, : int_{S} mathbf{u}^{*T} mathbf{T} dS + int_{V} mathbf{u}^{*T} mathbf{f} dV = int_{V} boldsymbol{epsilon}^{*T} boldsymbol{sigma} dV qquad mathrm{(e)} The right-hand-side of (d,e) is often called the internal virtual work. The principle of virtual work then states: External virtual work is equal to internal virtual work when equilibrated forces and stresses undergo unrelated but consistent displacements and strains. It includes the principle of virtual work for rigid bodies as a special case where the internal virtual work is zero. =Proof of equivalence between the principle of virtual work and the equilibrium equation= We start by looking at the total work done by surface traction on the body going through the specified deformation: : int_{S} mathbf{u cdot T} dS = int_{S} mathbf{u cdot boldsymbol {sigma} cdot n} dS Applying divergence theorem to the right hand side yields: : int_{S} mathbf{u cdot boldsymbol sigma cdot n} dS = int_V abla cdot left( mathbf{u} cdot boldsymbol {sigma} right) dV Now switch to indicial notation for the ease of derivation. : begin{align} int_V abla cdot left( mathbf{u} cdot boldsymbol {sigma} right) dV &= int_V frac{partial}{partial x_j} left( u_i sigma_{ij} right) dV  &= int_V frac{partial u_i}{partial x_j} sigma_{ij} + u_i frac{partial sigma_{ij}}{partial x_j} dV end{align} To continue our derivation, we substitute in the equilibrium equation frac{partial sigma_{ij}}{partial x_j} + f_i = 0 . Then : int_V frac{partial u_i}{partial x_j} sigma_{ij} + u_i frac{partial sigma_{ij}}{partial x_j} dV = int_V frac{partial u_i}{partial x_j} sigma_{ij} - u_i f_i dV The first term on the right hand side needs to be broken into a symmetric part and a skew part as follows: : begin{align} int_V frac{partial u_i}{partial x_j} sigma_{ij} - u_i f_i dV &= int_V frac12 left[ left( frac{partial u_i}{partial x_j} + frac{partial u_j}{partial x_i} right) + left( frac{partial u_i}{partial x_j} - frac{partial u_j}{partial x_i} right) right] sigma_{ij} - u_i f_i dV  &= int_V left[ epsilon_{ij} + frac12 left( frac{partial u_i}{partial x_j} - frac{partial u_j}{partial x_i} right) right] sigma_{ij} - u_i f_i dV  &= int_V epsilon_{ij} sigma_{ij} - u_i f_i dV &= int_V boldsymbolepsilon : boldsymbolsigma - mathbf u cdot mathbf f dV end{align} where boldsymbolepsilon is the strain that is consistent with the specified displacement field. The 2nd to last equality comes from the fact that the stress matrix is symmetric and that the product of a skew matrix and a symmetric matrix is zero. Now recap. We have shown through the above derivation that : int_{S} mathbf{u cdot T} dS = int_V boldsymbolepsilon : boldsymbolsigma dV - int_V mathbf u cdot mathbf f dV Move the 2nd term on the right hand side of the equation to the left: : int_{S} mathbf{u cdot T} dS + int_V mathbf u cdot mathbf f dV = int_V boldsymbolepsilon : boldsymbolsigma dV The physical interpretation of the above equation is, the External virtual work is equal to internal virtual work when equilibrated forces and stresses undergo unrelated but consistent displacements and strains. For practical applications: * In order to impose equilibrium on real stresses and forces, we use consistent virtual displacements and strains in the virtual work equation. * In order to impose consistent displacements and strains, we use equilibriated virtual stresses and forces in the virtual work equation. These two general scenarios give rise to two often stated variational principles. They are valid irrespective of material behaviour. =Principle of virtual displacements= Depending on the purpose, we may specialize the virtual work equation. For example, to derive the principle of virtual displacements in variational notations for supported bodies, we specify: * Virtual displacements and strains as variations of the real displacements and strains using variational notation such as delta mathbf {u} equiv mathbf{u}^* and delta boldsymbol {epsilon} equiv boldsymbol {epsilon}^Virtual displacements be zero on the part of the surface that has prescribed displacements, and thus the work done by the reactions is zero. There remains only external surface forces on the part S_t that do work. The virtual work equation then becomes the principle of virtual displacements: : int_{S_t} delta mathbf{u}^T mathbf{T} dS + int_{V} delta mathbf{u}^T mathbf{f} dV = int_{V}deltaboldsymbol{epsilon}^T boldsymbol{sigma} dV qquad mathrm{(f)} This relation is equivalent to the set of equilibrium equations written for a differential element in the deformable body as well as of the stress boundary conditions on the part S_t of the surface. Conversely, (f) can be reached, albeit in a non-trivial manner, by starting with the differential equilibrium equations and the stress boundary conditions on S_t , and proceeding in the manner similar to (a) and (b). Since virtual displacements are automatically compatible when they are expressed in terms of continuous, single-valued functions, we often mention only the need for consistency between strains and displacements. The virtual work principle is also valid for large real displacements; however, Eq.(f) would then be written using more complex measures of stresses and strains. =Principle of virtual forces= Here, we specify: * Virtual forces and stresses as variations of the real forces and stresses. * Virtual forces be zero on the part S_t of the surface that has prescribed forces, and thus only surface (reaction) forces on S_u (where displacements are prescribed) would do work. The virtual work equation becomes the principle of virtual forces: : int_{S_u} mathbf{u}^T delta mathbf{T} dS + int_{V} mathbf{u}^T delta mathbf{f} dV = int_{V} boldsymbol{epsilon}^T delta boldsymbol{sigma} dV qquad mathrm{(g)} This relation is equivalent to the set of strain-compatibility equations as well as of the displacement boundary conditions on the part S_u . It has another name: the principle of complementary virtual work. Alternative forms A specialization of the principle of virtual forces is the unit dummy force method, which is very useful for computing displacements in structural systems. According to D'Alembert's principle, inclusion of inertial forces as additional body forces will give the virtual work equation applicable to dynamical systems. More generalized principles can be derived by: * allowing variations of all quantities. * using Lagrange multipliers to impose boundary conditions and/or to relax the conditions specified in the two states. These are described in some of the references. Among the many energy principles in structural mechanics, the virtual work principle deserves a special place due to its generality that leads to powerful applications in structural analysis, solid mechanics, and finite element method in structural mechanics.

It lies on Joryeong Mountain between the main peak (1017 m) and Sinseon Peak (967 m). The pass itself rises to above sea level. Mungyeong Saejae connects Mungyeong City, North Gyeongsang province with Goesan County in North Chungcheong province. Water flowing down from the Mungyeong side of the pass eventually flows into the Nakdong River and meets the Sea of Japan at Busan. Runoff from the Goesan side eventually flows into the Han River, which passes through Seoul to meet the Yellow Sea at Incheon. The pass is also known by the name Joryeong (, ). Both names literally mean \\"bird pass,\\" and probably signify \\"a pass so high that even birds find the crossing difficult.\\" The pass is renowned as the only place where the old road between Seoul and Busan, the Great Yeongnam Road, still looks like it did in the Joseon Dynasty. On June 4, 1981, the area around the Mungyeong side of the pass was declared Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park, which is now a significant tourist attraction. In addition to the pass and the surrounding scenery, the park boasts a museum and tourist hotel, along with a small village of businesses catering to the tourist trade. During the Joseon period, Mungyeong Saejae played an important role as the gateway in and out of the Gyeongsang province. Scholars, traders and government officials from Gyeongsang had to go through the pass when going to or from Seoul. Three great gates which maintained control over the pass during that time still stand, although the only people who go through them now are tourists.

It is on the dip slope of the South Downs just north of the ridge called Portsdown Hill. Widley is served by the A3(T), trunk road which runs from Portsmouth to London. The main A3 to London (at this point the A3(M) motorway) is very close by, making it commutable by road. Widley is served by Cosham or Havant rail stations. Widley has three local pubs within walking distance. The George Inn sits on the top of Portsdown Hill and is considered a fine real ale pub. Further west, approximately ten minutes by foot away from the George, lies the Churchillian. Further North on the A3 lies the Hampshire Rose which is considered a family pub serving pub food and international lagers. History The Norman manor of Widley was held by the De Port and St John families of Cosham, and later passed to the Earls of Albemarle. In 1293, Isabel countess of Albemarle died without heirs and the manor passed back to the St John family. Later it was in the ownership of the Clynton and Uvedale families although the latter lost the manor temporarily in 1605, when accused of recusancy. It stayed in their family until 1766, when it was sold, and then passed by sale rather than inheritance. The original village of Widley stood approx 1 mile to the west of the current centre, around the site of the present Widley Farm. The settlement moved to be sited on the then newly built Cosham to Horndean turnpike road at the time of the building of the Portsdown forts and Christ Church, which was built as a place of worship for soldiers based in the forts. The new church of St Mary Magdalen was built in 1849. Remains of the village's former chapel can be found close to Widley Farm; members of Charles Dickens' family are buried in the graveyard. Governance Politically, the majority of Widley is part of Purbrook Ward of Havant Borough Council. However, a small strip to the south is part of the City of Portsmouth unitary authority and the most western parts (including Widley Farm) are in the Southwick and Widley parish of Winchester City Council. Fresh water supply in Widley is supplied by Portsmouth Water. Waste water is serviced by Southern Water. The nearest post office is Purbrook, situated within the One Stop Shop at 10-12 London Road, Purbrook or Cosham Post Office at 13 High Street Cosham.

For example, PH, the union of all complexity classes in the polynomial hierarchy, is precisely the class of languages expressible by statements of second-order logic. This connection between complexity and the logic of finite structures allows results to be transferred easily from one area to the other, facilitating new proof methods and providing additional evidence that the main complexity classes are somehow \\"natural\\" and not tied to the specific abstract machines used to define them. Specifically, each logical system produces a set of queries expressible in it. The queries ‚Äì when restricted to finite structures ‚Äì correspond to the computational problems of traditional complexity theory. The first main result of descriptive complexity was Fagin's theorem, shown by Ronald Fagin in 1974. It established that NP is precisely the set of languages expressible by sentences of existential second-order logic; that is, second order logic excluding universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. Many other classes were later characterized in such a manner, most of them by Neil Immerman: * First-order logic defines the class FO, corresponding to AC0, the languages recognized by polynomial-size circuits of bounded depth, which equals the languages recognized by a concurrent random access machine in constant time. * First-order logic with a commutative, transitive closure operator added yields SL, which equals L, problems solvable in logarithmic space. * First-order logic with a transitive closure operator yields NL, the problems solvable in nondeterministic logarithmic space. * In the presence of linear order, first-order logic with a least fixed point operator gives P, the problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time. * Existential second-order logic yields NP. * Universal second-order logic (excluding existential second- order quantification) yields co-NP. * Second-order logic corresponds to PH, as mentioned above. * Second-order logic with a transitive closure (commutative or not) yields PSPACE, the problems solvable in polynomial space. * Second- order logic with a least fixed point operator gives EXPTIME, the problems solvable in exponential time. * exist{color{Blue}mathsf{HO}}^i, logic with existential quantifier of order followed by a formula of order i-1 is equal to {color{Blue}mathsf{NTIME}}(exp_2^{i-2}(n^{O(1)})) * mathsf{HO}^i_j={color{Blue}mathsf{NTIME}}(exp_2^{i-2}(n^{O(1)}))^{Sigma_j^{mathsf P}} * HO is equal to ELEMENTARY  See also  * SO (complexity) * FO (complexity) * Spectrum of a sentence  References  * Ronald Fagin, Generalized First-Order Spectra and Polynomial-Time Recognizable Sets.

It was released for MS-DOS and Macintosh computers, as well as for the PlayStation, although the latter featured a selection of levels from Final Doom and from Master Levels for Doom II. Final Doom consists of two 32-level episodes (or megawads), TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. Unlike TNT: Evilution, which was officially licensed, The Plutonia Experiment was made by request of the team at id Software. The story in both episodes take place after the events of Doom II. TNT: Evilution features a new soundtrack not found in Doom and Doom II. Gameplay Final Doom plays identically to Doom II: Hell on Earth, and even features the same weapons, items, and monsters. The original game is widely considered to be significantly more difficult than its predecessors Doom and Doom II. The gameplay in the PlayStation version of Final Doom is nearly identical to that found in the PlayStation version of Doom, and, in addition, it was compatible with the PlayStation Mouse. Compared to the MS-DOS original, the PlayStation version's overall difficulty was significantly reduced. Many of the harder levels were removed and those that remained often had enemies taken out (most noticeably the Cyberdemon being removed from the level 'Baron's Lair'). As in the original PlayStation version of Doom, many of the larger levels from the original MS-DOS versions of Final Doom and Master Levels for Doom II were removed, and both the Arch-vile and Spider Mastermind monsters were removed, due to technical constraints. This limited the PlayStation version to 30 levels in total. The more traditional rock tracks featured in Final Doom were replaced by a creepier ambient soundtrack by Aubrey Hodges, who later composed the music for Doom 64 in 1997. There are several noticeable alterations to the presentation of Final Doom in the PlayStation version compared to the computer versions. The simplistic title screens featured in the computer versions have been replaced by a more elaborate title screen that features the animated flame-filled sky texture from the original PlayStation version of Doom. Many of the levels' sky textures have been replaced by different ones; some levels' skies are replaced by sky textures seen in previous Doom games, whereas others now feature a new starry sky texture. Finally, most of the level layouts are simplified, similar to previous Doom console ports, and the frame rate of the game is often lower than it was in the first PlayStation Doom game. Plot =TNT: Evilution= In TNT: Evilution, the UAC are once again intent on developing and experimenting with dimensional gateway technology. They set up a base on one of the moons of Jupiter, with a solid detachment of space marines for protection. The marines do their job well; when the first experimental gateway is opened, they annihilate the forces of Hell. Research continues with more confidence and all security measures turned at the gateway. A few months later, the yearly supply ship comes ahead of schedule, and looks strange and unusually big on the radar. The lax radar operators decide that there is nothing to worry about. The personnel of the base go out to behold the terrible truth: it is a spaceship from Hell, built out of steel, stone, flesh, bone and corruption. The ship's enormous gates open to unleash a rain of demons on the base. Quickly, the entire facility is overrun, and everyone is slain or zombified. The main character, the nameless space marine (who was revealed to be the marine commander on the moon) has been away on a walk at that time and thus escapes death or zombification. After being attacked by an imp, he rushes back to the base where he sees the demonic spaceship still hovering above it and realizes what has happened. He then swears that he will avenge his slain troops and sets out to kill as many demons as possible. In the end, the marine defeats the Icon of Sin and the game describes \\"something rumbles in the distance. A blue light glows within the ruined skull of the demon-spitter.\\" =The Plutonia Experiment= In The Plutonia Experiment, after Hell's catastrophic invasion of Earth, the global governments decide to take measures against any possible future invasion, knowing that the powers of Hell still remained strong. The UAC is refounded under completely new management (the old trustees and stockholders were all dead anyway) and aims at developing tools that would prevent demonic invasions. The scientists start working on a device known as the Quantum Accelerator that is intended to close invasion Gates and stop possible invasions. The experiments are carried out in a secret research complex, with a stationed detachment of marines. The work seems to be going well but the creatures from Outside have their attention drawn towards the new research. A Gate opens in the heart of the complex and unnatural horrors pour out. The Quantum Accelerator performs superbly: the Gate is quickly closed and the invasion is stopped. Research continues more boldly. On the next day, a ring of 7 Gates opens and an even greater invasion begins. For one hour the Quantum Accelerators manage to close 6 of the Gates, but the Hellish army has become too numerous and too strong. The complex is overrun. Everyone is slain, or zombified. The last Gate of Hell remains open, manned and guarded by a Gatekeeper: a powerful, enormous and ancient demon that has the power to open Dimensional Gates and control or protect them. The government, frantic that the Quantum Accelerator will be destroyed or used against humanity, orders all marines to the site at once. The player, the nameless space marine, was on leave at the beach. He was also closest to the site and gets there first. There he discovers that there is much demonic activity (howling, chanting, machine sounds) within the complex; the Gatekeeper is obviously working on something, and his work would soon reach some awful climax. He also realizes that when the marines arrive, they would not be able to penetrate the heavily infested complex, despite the firepower and support they will have. The marine decides to enter the complex and stop the Gatekeeper alone. Development Work on TNT: Evilution was started by TeamTNT, a group of WAD-making hobbyists who were active on the advanced Doom editing mailing list. Just days before it was to be released as a free download online, the project was acquired by id Software, and finished in November 1995. Brothers Dario and Milo Casali, who had contributed four levels to TNT: Evilution, were assigned the task of creating what became The Plutonia Experiment after having sent an eight-level WAD they had created to American McGee and managing to impress him along with the rest of the id Software crew. They created 16 levels each for The Plutonia Experiment in four months time, and submitted them in January 1996. Unlike their contributions to TNT: Evilution, which were edited after submission (four were also rejected due to being too large to run on the computers of the day), these were the final revisions of the levels, and Dario Casali later commented about the fact that no changes were requested: \\"Thank God because I was ready to throw my computer out the window at the time.\\" Dario Casali acknowledged the difficulty level of The Plutonia Experiment in an interview on Doomworld, stating \\"Plutonia was always meant for people who had finished Doom 2 on hard and were looking for a new challenge. I always played through the level I had made on hard, and if I could beat it too easily, I made it harder, so it was a challenge for me.\\" Reception Reviewing the PC version in GameSpot, Jim Varner argued that Final Doom is a waste of money, since it is essentially just a new set of level maps for Doom, and there were already thousands of such maps available to download for free on the internet. While Major Mike of GamePro criticized that Final Doom has no new enemies or weapons, and that the PlayStation version includes only 30 levels as compared to the PC version's 64, he was pleased with the \\"huge, perplexing, and sometimes sadistic levels\\" and the new scenery, and considered Doom still a compelling enough game that simply more of the same was enough to satisfy. PlayStation Magazine gave it a score of 9/10, calling it \\"essential\\".PSM 13 A reviewer for Next Generation was less impressed, remarking that a side-by-side comparison with the PlayStation version of the original Doom reveals that Final Doom has a much lower frame rate, less precise control, and more visible seams in the textures. Three of the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly said they were tired of seeing ports of Doom, and that Final Doom was simply another such port with new level maps.

Deborah joined King's College London as Director, Cultural Partnerships in 2012. In 2015 she was appointed as the university's Assistant Principal (London) and in 2018 was named Vice President & Vice-Principal (London). Born in Derby, and brought up in Kent and Lincolnshire, she studied dance from the age of seven, first locally, and then, on the recommendation of her teacher, at the Royal Ballet School. Whilst at the school she won the 1980 Prix de Lausanne, the prestigious international ballet competition.  Ballet career  She was invited to join The Royal Ballet in 1981, having toured with the company as a student during the summer. The teachers that Bull identified as the \\"resident teachers\\" were Brian Shaw, Alexander Agadzhanov, Betty Anderton and the Norwegian Gerd Larsen. Bull particularly admired Larsen's ability to introduce mime. Bull was promoted through the ranks and gained principal status in 1992, immediately following the company's opening performance in Japan, at which she danced the role of Gamzatti in La Bayadere. During her twenty years in The Royal Ballet, she danced a wide range of work throughout the repertoire. Her leading roles in the classics included Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty and Kitri in Don Quixote, and she created roles for Ashley Page, David Bintley, Michael Corder, Emma Diamond, Wayne McGregor, Glen Tetley and Twyla Tharp. She received particular praise for her performances in the works of George Balanchine and William Forsythe. In 1995 Forsythe staged for her the first performance in this country of his ballet Steptext, and she was subsequently nominated for a 1996 Olivier Award in the 'Outstanding Achievement In Dance' Category for her interpretation. She was named as 1996 Dancer of the Year by both The Sunday Express and The Independent on Sunday, who praised her work both on and off the stage, saying 'here is a dancer whose intelligence and courage - for once - don't reside entirely in the tips of her toes'. Away from The Royal Ballet, she toured Italy, North America and Canada with Wayne Eagling's group, 'Stars of the Royal Ballet', and was invited to join Irek Mukhamedov for the debut performances of his company 'Irek Mukhamedov and Friends' in 1992. She danced at the 1993 and 1995 Harrogate International Festival, and in April 1996 was invited to perform in the first 'Diamonds of World Ballet' Gala at the Kremlin Palace, Moscow. She has toured Japan with Tetsuya Kumakawa and in the summers of 1994 and 1995 she organised, staged and starred in An Evening of British Ballet at the Sintra Festival in Portugal. In March 2001, she was invited to star in the triple bill Nijinsky Ritrovato at the Rome Opera House, dancing the Chosen Maiden in Rite of Spring and alongside Carla Fracci in Jeux.  Artists‚Äô Development Initiative  In addition to her work with The Royal Ballet, she founded in 1998 the Artists‚Äô Development Initiative at the Royal Opera House, a programme designed to open up the resources and expertise within the theatre to small-scale companies and independent artists. Over its first two years, ADI worked with over 250 artists from outside the Royal Opera House and facilitated collaborations across art forms and between independent choreographers and classical dancers. ADI shared the 2001 Time Out Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance with Wayne McGregor for Symbiont(s), premiered in the Clore Studio Upstairs in June 2000.  ROH2  She retired from The Royal Ballet in August 2001 to take up a new position at the Royal Opera House in January 2002, as Creative Director, ROH2, developing a range of small-scale and experimental artistic initiatives and overseeing the programme in the theatre's alternative performance spaces. In 2004, her remit expanded to include the delivery of a strategy for the ROH's work away from the main stage, including an alternative performance programme, opera and dance development initiatives, Big Screen live relays from the main stage, an ‚ÄòOn the Road‚Äô programme and daytime activities in the building. In addition, she managed ROH Collections, the Royal Opera House's extensive archives, and was focused on the organisation's Olympic planning and audience engagement strategies. In 2008, she was made Creative Director of the Royal Opera House, a post she held until 2012.  Publishing  In addition to her work as a dancer, she has regularly written and lectured on the arts. In January 1996 she debated at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion 'This House Believes the National Lottery Gives Too Much Money to the Elitist Arts'. Her address was described by Lord Gowrie, her debating partner, as 'the best speech I have heard on the Arts in 30 years'. The motion was heavily defeated, a triumph which the Evening Standard attributed largely to 'the eloquence of a ballerina, unaccustomed to public speaking', describing her speech as 'cogently argued and delivered with generosity of spirit'. In October 1996 she was invited by Lord Gowrie to deliver the Arts Council Annual Lecture at the Royal Society for the Arts, 'From Private Patronage to Public Purse'. She has written articles for The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Times, The Sunday Telegraph, Classic FM Magazine, New Statesman and The Spectator, and reviewed for The Telegraph, The Literary Review and several dance magazines.

History and general stay-behind structure =British experience during World War II = Following the fall of France in 1940, Winston Churchill created the Special Operations Executive (SOE) to both assist resistance movements and itself carry out sabotage and subversive operations in occupied Europe. It was revealed half a century later that SOE was complemented by a stay-behind organisation in Britain, created in extreme secrecy, to prepare for a possible invasion by Nazi Germany. A network of resistance fighters was formed across Britain and arms caches were established. The network was recruited, in part, from the 5th (Ski) Battalion of the Scots Guards (which had originally been formed, but was not deployed, to fight alongside Finnish forces fighting the Soviet invasion of Finland). The network, which became known as the Auxiliary Units, was headed by Major Colin Gubbins ‚Äì an expert in guerrilla warfare (who would later lead SOE). The units were trained, in part, by \\"Mad Mike\\" Calvert, a Royal Engineers officer who specialised in demolition by explosives and covert raiding operations. To the extent that they were publicly visible, the Auxiliary Units were disguised as Home Guard units, under GHQ Home Forces. The network was allegedly disbanded in 1944; some of its members subsequently joined the Special Air Service and saw action in North-West Europe. While David Lampe published a book on the Auxiliary Units in 1968,David Lampe, The Last Ditch: Britain's Resistance Plans against the Nazis Cassell 1968 their existence did not become widely known by the public until reporters such as David Pallister of The Guardian revived interest in them during the 1990s. =Post-war creation= After World War II, the UK and the US decided to create \\"stay- behind\\" paramilitary organizations, with the official aim of countering a possible Soviet invasion through sabotage and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. Arms caches were hidden, escape routes prepared, and loyal members recruited, whether in Italy or in other European countries. Its clandestine \\"cells\\" were to stay behind in enemy-controlled territory and to act as resistance movements, conducting sabotage, guerrilla warfare and assassinations. The stay-behind armies were created with the experience and involvement of former SOE officers. Following Giulio Andreotti's October 1990 revelations, General John Hackett, former commander-in-chief of the British Army on the Rhine, declared on November 16, 1990, that a contingency plan involving \\"stay behind and resistance in depth\\" was drawn up after the war. The same week, Anthony Farrar-Hockley, former commander-in-chief of NATO's Forces in Northern Europe from 1979 to 1982, declared to The Guardian that a secret arms network was established in Britain after the war. Hackett had written in 1978 a novel, The Third World War: August 1985, which was a fictionalized scenario of a Soviet Army invasion of West Germany in 1985. The novel was followed in 1982 by The Third World War: The Untold Story, which elaborated on the original. Farrar-Hockley had aroused controversy in 1983 when he became involved in trying to organise a campaign for a new Home Guard against a potential Soviet invasion.Dan van der Vat. \\"Obituary: General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley,\\" Guardian. 15 March 2006 Operating in all of NATO and even in some neutral countries such as Spain before its 1982 admission to NATO, Gladio was first coordinated by the Clandestine Committee of the Western Union (CCWU), founded in 1948. After the creation of NATO in 1949, the CCWU was integrated into the \\"Clandestine Planning Committee\\" (CPC), founded in 1951 and overseen by the SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe), transferred to Belgium after France's official withdrawal from the NATO military organization ‚Äì but not from NATO ‚Äì which was not followed by the dissolution of the French stay-behind paramilitary movements. Historian Daniele Ganser claims that: > Next to the CPC, a second secret army command center, labeled Allied > Clandestine Committee (ACC), was set up in 1957 on the orders of NATO's > Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR). This military structure > provided for significant US leverage over the secret stay-behind networks in > Western Europe as the SACEUR, throughout NATO's history, has traditionally > been a US General who reports to the Pentagon in Washington and is based in > NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. > The ACC's duties included elaborating on the directives of the network, > developing its clandestine capability, and organizing bases in Britain and > the United States.

The clandestine > international network covered the European NATO membership, including > Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, > Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey, as well as the neutral European > countries of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) responded to the series of accusations made by Ganser in his book regarding the CIA's involvement in Operation Gladio, by claiming that neither Ganser nor anyone else could have solid evidence supporting their accusations. At one point in his book Ganser talks about the CIA's covert action policies as being \\"terrorist in nature\\" and then accuses the CIA of using their \\"networks for political terrorism\\". The CIA responded by noting that Daniele Ganser's sourcing is \\"largely secondary\\" and that Ganser himself has complained about \\"not being able to find any official sources to support his charges of the CIA's or any Western European government's involvement with Gladio\\". The existence of these clandestine NATO units remained a closely guarded secret throughout the Cold War until 1990, when the first branch of the international network was discovered in Italy. It was code-named Gladio, the Italian word for a short double-edged sword gladius. While the press said that the NATO stay-behind units were 'the best- kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II', the Italian government, amidst sharp public criticism, promised to close down the secret army. Italy insisted identical clandestine units had also existed in all other countries of Western Europe. This allegation proved correct and subsequent research found that in Belgium, the secret NATO unit was code-named SDRA8, in Denmark Absalon, in Germany TD BDJ, in Greece LOK, in Luxemburg Stay-Behind, in the Netherlands I&O;, in Norway ROC, in Portugal Aginter Press, in Spain Red Quantum, in Switzerland P26, in Turkey √ñzel Harp Dairesi, In Sweden AGAG (Aktions Gruppen Arla Gryning), in France 'Plan Bleu', and in Austria OWSGV; however, the code name of the stay-behind unit in Finland remains unknown. Upon learning of the discovery, the parliament of the European Union (EU) drafted a resolution sharply criticizing the fact. Yet only Italy, Belgium and Switzerland carried out parliamentary investigations, while the administration of President George H. W. Bush refused to comment.Len Scott, R. Gerald Hughes Intelligence, Crises and Security: Prospects and Retrospects, Routledge, 2008, p. 123 If Gladio was \\"the best-kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II\\",O'Shaughnessy, Hugh. \\"Gladio: Europe's Secret Networks,\\" The Observer, 18 November 1990. it must be underlined, however, that on several occasions, arms caches were discovered and stay-behind paramilitary organizations officially dissolved. NATO's \\"stay- behind\\" organizations were never called upon to resist a Soviet invasion. According to a November 13, 1990, Reuters cable, \\"Andr√© Moyen ‚Äì a former member of the Belgian military security service and of the [stay-behind] network ‚Äì said Gladio was not just anti-Communist but was for fighting subversion in general.

(Obituary.) Gladio's existence came to public knowledge when Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti revealed it to the Chamber of Deputies on October 24, 1990, although far-right terrorist Vincenzo Vinciguerra had already revealed its existence during his 1984 trial. According to media analyst Edward S. Herman, \\"both the President of Italy, Francesco Cossiga, and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, had been involved in the Gladio organization and coverup ...\\" According to the former Italian Ministry of Grace and Justice Claudio Martelli, during the 1980s and 1990s Andreotti was the political reference of Licio Gelli and the Masonic lodge Propaganda 2. Giulio Andreotti's revelations on 24 October 1990 Christian Democrat Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti publicly recognized the existence of Gladio on 24 October 1990. Andreotti spoke of a \\"structure of information, response and safeguard\\", with arms caches and reserve officers. He gave to the Commissione StragiThe parliamentary commission later led by senator Giovanni Pellegrino, in charge of investigations on bombings committed during the Years of Lead in Italy. a list of 622 civilians who according to him were part of Gladio. Andreotti also stated that 127 weapons caches had been dismantled, and said that Gladio had not been involved in any of the bombings committed from the 1960s to the 1980s. Andreotti declared that the Italian military services (predecessors of the SISMI) had joined in 1964 the Allied Clandestine Committee created in 1957 by the US, France, Belgium and Greece, and which was in charge of directing Gladio's operations.Barbera, Myriam. \\"Gladio: et la France?,\\" L'Humanit√©, November 10, 1990 . However, Gladio was actually set up under Minister of Defence (from 1953 to 1958) Paolo Taviani's supervision. Beside, the list of Gladio members given by Andreotti was incomplete. It didn't include, for example, Antonio Arconte, who described an organization very different from the one brushed by Giulio Andreotti: an organization closely tied to the SID secret service and the Atlanticist strategy.Gladio e caso Moro: Arconte su morte Ferraro, \\"La Nuova Sardegna\\" According to Andreotti, the stay-behind organisations set up in all of Europe did not come \\"under broad NATO supervision until 1959.\\"Pallister, David. \\"How M16 and SAS Join In,\\" The Guardian, December 5, 1990 General Serravalle's statement General Gerardo Serravalle, who commanded the Italian Gladio from 1971 to 1974, related that \\"in the 1970s the members of the CPC [Coordination and Planning Committee] were the officers responsible for the secret structures of Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands and Italy. These representatives of the secret structures met every year in one of the capitals... At the stay-behind meetings representatives of the CIA were always present. They had no voting rights and were from the CIA headquarters of the capital in which the meeting took place... members of the US Forces Europe Command were present, also without voting rights. \\"Gerardo Serravalle, Gladio (Rome: Edizione Associate, , 1991), p.78-79 Next to the CPC a second secret command post was created in 1957, the Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC). According to the Belgian Parliamentary Committee on Gladio, the ACC was \\"responsible for coordinating the 'Stay- behind' networks in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Holland, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States\\". During peacetime, the activities of the ACC \\"included elaborating the directives for the network, developing its clandestine capability and organising bases in Britain and the United States. In wartime, it was to plan stay-behind operations in conjunction with SHAPE; organisers were to activate clandestine bases and organise operations from there\\".Belgian Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry into Gladio, quoted by Daniele Ganser (2005) General Serravale declared to the Commissione Stragi headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino that the Italian Gladio members trained at a military base in Britain. =Belgium= After the 1967 withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure, the SHAPE headquarters were displaced to Mons in Belgium. In 1990, following France's denial of any \\"stay-behind\\" French army, Giulio Andreotti publicly said the last Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) meeting, at which the French branch of Gladio was present, had been on October 23 and 24, 1990, under the presidency of Belgian General Van Calster, director of the Belgian military secret service SGR. In November, Guy Co√´me, the Minister of the Defense, acknowledged the existence of a Belgian \\"stay-behind\\" army, raising concerns about a similar implication in terrorist acts as in Italy. The same year, the European Parliament sharply condemned NATO and the United States in a resolution for having manipulated European politics with the stay-behind armies.Chronology , Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies, ETH Zurich New legislation governing intelligence agencies' missions and methods was passed in 1998, following two government inquiries and the creation of a permanent parliamentary committee in 1991, which was to bring them under the authority of Belgium's federal agencies. The Commission was created following events in the 1980s, which included the Brabant massacres and the activities of the far- right group Westland New Post.Official site of the Belgian Permanent Committee for the Control of Intelligence Services See \\"history\\" section in the \\"Presentation\\" part. =Denmark= The Danish stay-behind army was code-named Absalon, after a Danish archbishop, and led by E.J. Harder. It was hidden in the military secret service Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste (FE). In 1978, William Colby, former director of the CIA, released his memoirs in which he described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in Scandinavia: > The situation in each Scandinavian country was different. Norway and Denmark > were NATO allies, Sweden held to the neutrality that had taken her through > two world wars, and Finland were required to defer in its foreign policy to > the Soviet power directly on its borders. Thus, in one set of these > countries the governments themselves would build their own stay-behind nets, > counting on activating them from exile to carry on the struggle. These nets > had to be co-ordinated with NATO's plans, their radios had to be hooked to a > future exile location, and the specialised equipment had to be secured from > CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use. In the other set of > countries, CIA would have to do the job alone or with, at best, \\"unofficial\\" > local help, since the politics of those governments barred them from > collaborating with NATO, and any exposure would arouse immediate protest > from the local Communist press, Soviet diplomats and loyal Scandinavians who > hoped that neutrality or nonalignment would allow them to slip through a > World War III unharmed. =France= In 1947, Interior Minister √âdouard Depreux revealed the existence of a secret stay-behind army in France codenamed \\"Plan Bleu\\". The next year, the \\"Western Union Clandestine Committee\\" (WUCC) was created to coordinate secret unorthodox warfare. In 1949, the WUCC was integrated into NATO, whose headquarters were established in France, under the name \\"Clandestine Planning Committee\\" (CPC). In 1958, NATO founded the Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) to coordinate secret warfare. The network was supported with elements from SDECE, and had military support from the 11th Choc regiment. The former director of DGSE, admiral Pierre Lacoste, alleged in a 1992 interview with The Nation, that certain elements from the network were involved in terrorist activities against de Gaulle and his Algerian policy. A section of the 11th Choc regiment split over the 1962 √âvian peace accords, and became part of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS), but it is unclear if this also involved members of the French stay-behind network. Quoted in Ganser's \\"Terrorism in Western Europe\\". La Rose des Vents and Arc-en-ciel (\\"Rainbow\\") network were part of Gladio. Fran√ßois de Grossouvre was Gladio's leader for the region around Lyon in France until his alleged suicide on April 7, 1994. Grossouvre would have asked Constantin Melnik, leader of the French secret services during the Algerian War of Independence (1954‚Äì62), to return to activity. He was living in comfortable exile in the US, where he maintained links with the Rand Corporation. Constantin Melnik is alleged to have been involved in the creation in 1952 of the Ordre Souverain du Temple Solaire, an ancestor of the Order of the Solar Temple, created by former A.M.O.R.C. members, in which the SDECE (French former military intelligence agency) was interested.Daeninckx, Didier. \\"Du Temple Solaire au r√©seau Gladio, en passant par Politica Hermetica...,\\" February 27, 2002. =Germany= US intelligence also assisted in the set up of a German stay-behind network. CIA documents released in June 2006 under the 1998 Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, show that the CIA organized \\"stay-behind\\" networks of German agents between 1949 and 1953. According to the Washington Post, \\"One network included at least two former Nazi SS members‚ÄîStaff Sgt. Heinrich Hoffman and Lt. Col. Hans Rues‚Äîand one was run by Lt. Col. Walter Kopp, a former German army officer referred to by the CIA as an \\"unreconstructed Nazi\\". \\"The network was disbanded in 1953 amid political concerns that some members' neo-Nazi sympathies would be exposed in the West German press.\\"Lee, Christopher. CIA Ties With Ex-Nazis Shown, Washington Post, June 7, 2006. Documents shown to the Italian parliamentary terrorism committee revealed that in the 1970s British and French officials involved in the network visited a training base in Germany built with US money.Norton-Taylor, Richard and David Gow. Secret Italian Unit,\\" The Guardian, November 17, 1990 In 1976, the secret service BND secretary Heidrun Hofer was arrested after having revealed the secrets of the German stay-behind army to her husband, who was a spy of the KGB. In 2004 the German author Norbert Juretzko published a book about his work at the BND. He went into details about recruiting partisans for the German stay-behind network. He was sacked from BND following a secret trial against him, because the BND could not find out the real name of his Russian source \\"R√ºbezahl\\" whom he had recruited. A man with the name he put on file was arrested by the KGB following treason in the BND, but was obviously innocent, his name having been chosen at random from the public phone book by Juretzko. According to Juretzko, the BND built up its branch of Gladio, but discovered after the fall of the German Democratic Republic that it was fully known to the Stasi early on. When the network was dismantled, further odd details emerged. One fellow \\"spymaster\\" had kept the radio equipment in his cellar at home with his wife doing the engineering test call every four months, on the grounds that the equipment was too \\"valuable\\" to remain in civilian hands. Juretzko found out because this spymaster had dismantled his section of the network so quickly, there had been no time for measures such as recovering all caches of supplies. Civilians recruited as stay-behind partisans were equipped with a clandestine shortwave radio with a fixed frequency. It had a keyboard with digital encryption, making use of traditional Morse code obsolete. They had a cache of further equipment for signalling helicopters or submarines to drop special agents who were to stay in the partisan's homes while mounting sabotage operations against the communists. =Greece= When Greece joined NATO in 1952, the country's special forces, LOK (Lochoi Orein≈çn Katadrom≈çn, i.e., \\"mountain raiding companies\\"), were integrated into the European stay-behind network. The CIA and LOK reconfirmed on March 25, 1955 their mutual co- operation in a secret document signed by US General Truscott for the CIA, and Konstantinos Dovas, chief of staff of the Greek military. In addition to preparing for a Soviet invasion, the CIA instructed LOK to prevent a leftist coup. Former CIA agent Philip Agee, who was sharply criticized in the US for having revealed sensitive information, insisted that \\"paramilitary groups, directed by CIA officers, operated in the sixties throughout Europe [and he stressed that] perhaps no activity of the CIA could be as clearly linked to the possibility of internal subversion.\\"Philip Agee and Louis Wolf, Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe (Secaucus: Lyle Stuart Inc., 1978), p.154 (quoted by Daniele Ganser) (2005) p.216 According to historian Daniele Ganser, LOK was involved in the military coup d'√©tat on 21 April 1967, which took place one month before the scheduled national elections for which opinion polls predicted an overwhelming victory of the centrist Center Union of George and Andreas Papandreou. Under the command of paratrooper Lieutenant Colonel Costas Aslanides, LOK took control of the Greek Defence Ministry while Brigadier General Stylianos Pattakos gained control of communication centers, parliament, the royal palace, and according to detailed lists, arrested over 10,000 people. According to Ganser, Phillips Talbot, the US ambassador in Athens, disapproved of the military coup which established the \\"Regime of the Colonels\\" (1967‚Äì1974), complaining that it represented \\"a rape of democracy\\"‚Äîto which Jack Maury, the CIA chief of station in Athens, answered, \\"How can you rape a whore?\\" Arrested and then exiled in Canada and Sweden, Andreas Papandreou later returned to Greece, where he won the 1981 election, forming the first socialist government of Greece's post-war history. According to his own testimony, Ganser alleges, he discovered the existence of the secret NATO army, then codenamed \\"Red Sheepskin\\", as acting prime minister in 1984 and had given orders to dissolve it. Following Giulio Andreotti's revelations in 1990, the Greek defence minister confirmed that a branch of the network, known as Operation Sheepskin, operated in his country until 1988.\\"NATO's secret network 'also operated in France'\\", The Guardian, November 14, 1990, p. 6 In December 2005, journalist Kleanthis Grivas published an article in To Proto Thema, a Greek Sunday newspaper, in which he accused \\"Sheepskin\\" for the assassination of CIA station chief Richard Welch in Athens in 1975, as well as the assassination of British military attach√© Stephen Saunders in 2000. This was denied by the US State Department, who responded that \\"the Greek terrorist organization '17 November' was responsible for both assassinations\\", and that Grivas's central piece of evidence had been the Westmoreland Field Manual which the state department, as well as an independent congressional inquiry, have alleged to be a Soviet forgery. The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, \\"Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials\\" while \\"Sheepskin\\" couldn't have assassinated Stephen Saunders for the simple reason that, according to the US government, \\"the Greek government stated it dismantled the 'stay behind' network in 1988.\\" =Netherlands= Speculation that the Netherlands was involved in Gladio arose from the accidental discovery of large arms caches in 1980 and 1983. In the latter incident, people walking in a forest near the village of Rozendaal, near Arnhem, chanced upon a large hidden cache of arms, containing dozens of hand grenades, semiautomatic rifles, automatic pistols, munitions and explosives.https://mijngelderlandmedia.azureedge.net/files/verhalen_pdf/Jongeren_vinden_wapenarsenaal_van_geheime_dienst.pdf That discovery forced the Dutch government to confirm that the arms were related to NATO planning for unorthodox warfare. In 1990, then-Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers told the Dutch Parliament that his office was running a secret organisation that had been set up inside the Dutch defence ministry in the 1950s, but denied it was supervised directly by NATO or other foreign bodies. He went to inform that successive prime ministers and defence chiefs had always preferred not to inform other Cabinet members or Parliament about the secret organization. It was modeled on the nation's World War II experiences of having to evacuate the royal family and transfer government to a government-in-exile, originally aiming to provide an underground intelligence network to a government-in-exile in the event of a foreign invasion, although it included elements of guerilla warfare. Former Dutch Defence Minister Henk Vredeling confirmed the group had set up arms caches around the Netherlands for sabotage purposes. Members of the cell are believed to have taken part in a training exercise in Sicily. The operating bureaus of the organisation would also move to safety in England or the US at the first sign of trouble. Already in 1990, it was known that the weapons cache near Velp, while accidentally 'discovered' in 1983, had been plundered partially before. It still contained dozens of hand grenades, semiautomatic rifles, automatic pistols, munitions and explosives at the time of discovery, but five hand grenades had gone missing. A Dutch investigative television program revealed on 9 September 2007, that another arms cache that had belonged to Gladio had been ransacked in the 1980s. It was located in a park near Scheveningen. Some of the stolen weapons, including hand grenades and machine guns, later turned up when police officials arrested criminals John Mieremet and Sam Klepper in 1991. The Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD feared at the time that disclosure of the Gladio history of these weapons would have been politically sensitive. =Norway= In 1957, the director of the secret service NIS, Vilhelm Evang, protested strongly against the pro-active intelligence activities at AFNORTH, as described by the chairman of CPC: \\"[NIS] was extremely worried about activities carried out by officers at Kols√•s. This concerned SB, Psywar and Counter Intelligence.\\" These activities supposedly included the blacklisting of Norwegians. SHAPE denied these allegations. Eventually, the matter was resolved in 1958, after Norway was assured about how stay-behind networks were to be operated. In 1978, the police discovered an arms cache and radio equipment at a mountain cabin and arrested Hans Otto Meyer, a businessman accused of being involved in selling illegal alcohol. Meyer claimed that the weapons were supplied by Norwegian intelligence. Rolf Hansen, defence minister at that time, stated the network was not in any way answerable to NATO and had no CIA connection. =Portugal= In 1966, the CIA set up Aginter Press which, under the direction of Captain Yves Gu√©rin-S√©rac (who had taken part in the founding of the OAS), ran a secret stay-behind army and trained its members in covert action techniques amounting to terrorism, including bombings, silent assassinations, subversion techniques, clandestine communication and infiltration and colonial warfare. =Turkey= As one of the nations that prompted the Truman Doctrine, Turkey is one of the first countries to participate in Operation Gladio and, some say, the only country where it has not been purged. The counter-guerrillas' existence in Turkey was revealed in 1973 by then-prime minister B√ºlent Ecevit. Parallel stay-behind operations in non-NATO countries = Austria = In Austria, the first secret stay- behind army was exposed in 1947. It had been set up by the far-right Soucek and R√∂ssner, who both insisted during their trial that \\"they were carrying out the secret operation with the full knowledge and support of the US and British occupying powers.\\" Sentenced to death, they were pardoned under mysterious circumstances by President K√∂rner (1951‚Äì1957). Franz Olah set up a new secret army codenamed √ñsterreichischer Wander-, Sport- und Geselligkeitsverein (OeWSGV, literally \\"Austrian Association of Hiking, Sports and Society\\"), with the cooperation of MI6 and the CIA. He later explained that \\"we bought cars under this name. We installed communication centres in several regions of Austria\\", confirming that \\"special units were trained in the use of weapons and plastic explosives\\". He stated that \\"there must have been a couple of thousand people working for us... Only very, very highly positioned politicians and some members of the union knew about it\\". In 1965, police discovered a stay-behind arms cache in an old mine close to Windisch-Bleiberg and forced the British authorities to hand over a list with the location of 33 other caches in Austria. In 1990, when secret \\"stay-behind\\" armies were uncovered all around Europe, the Austrian government said that no secret army had existed in the country. However, six years later, the Boston Globe revealed the existence of secret CIA arms caches in Austria. Austrian President Thomas Klestil and Chancellor Franz Vranitzky insisted that they had known nothing of the existence of the secret army and demanded that the US launch a full-scale investigation into the violation of Austria's neutrality, which was denied by President Bill Clinton. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns‚Äîappointed in August 2001 by President George Bush as the US Permanent Representative to the Atlantic treaty organization, where, as ambassador to NATO, he headed the combined State-Defense Department United States Mission to NATO and coordinated the NATO response to the September 11, 2001 attacks‚Äîinsisted: \\"The aim was noble, the aim was correct, to try to help Austria if it was under occupation. What went wrong is that successive Washington administrations simply decided not to talk to the Austrian government about it.\\" =Finland= In 1944, the Swedes worked with Finnish Intelligence to set up a stay-behind network of agents within Finland to keep track of post-war activities in that country. While this network was allegedly never put in place, Finnish codes, SIGINT equipment and documents were brought to Sweden and apparently exploited until the 1980s.C. G. McKay, Bengt Beckman, Swedish Signal Intelligence, Frank Cass Publishers, 2002, p. 202 In 1945, Interior Minister Yrj√∂ Leino exposed a secret stay-behind army which was closed down (so-called Weapons Cache Case). This operation was organized by Finnish general staff officers (without foreign help) in 1944 to hide weapons in order to sustain large-scale guerrilla warfare in the event the Soviet Union tried to occupy Finland in following the end of combat on the Finnish- Soviet front of WWII. See also Operation Stella Polaris. In 1991, the Swedish media claimed that a secret stay-behind army had existed in neutral Finland with an exile base in Stockholm. Finnish Defence Minister Elisabeth Rehn called the revelations \\"a fairy tale\\", adding cautiously \\"or at least an incredible story, of which I know nothing.\\" However, in his memoirs, former CIA director William Colby described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in Scandinavian countries, including Finland, with or without the assistance of local governments, to prepare for a Soviet invasion.Colby, William. \\"A Scandinavian Spy,\\" Chapter 3. (Former CIA director 's memoirs.) =Spain= Several events prior to Spain's 1982 membership in NATO have also been tied to Gladio. In May 1976, half a year after Franco's death, two Carlist militants were shot down by far-right terrorists, among whom were Gladio operative Stefano Delle Chiaie and members of the Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A), demonstrating connections between Gladio and the South American \\"Dirty War\\" of the Operation Condor. This incident became known as the Montejurra incident. According to a report by the Italian CESIS (Executive Committee for Intelligence and Security Services), Carlo Cicuttini (who took part in the 1972 Peteano bombing in Italy alongside Vincenzo Vinciguerra), participated in the 1977 Massacre of Atocha in Madrid, killing five people (including several lawyers), members of the Workers' Commissions trade-unions closely linked with the Spanish Communist Party. Cicuttini was a naturalized Spaniard and exiled in Spain since 1972 (date of the Peteano bombing).Un informe oficial italiano implica en el crimen de Atocha al 'ultra' Cicuttini, relacionado con Gladio, El Pa√≠s, December 2, 1990 Following Andreotti's 1990 revelations, Adolfo Su√°rez, Spain's first democratically elected prime minister after Franco's death, denied ever having heard of Gladio.Su√°rez afirma que en su etapa de presidente nunca se habl√≥ de la red Gladio, El Pa√≠s, November 18, 1990 President of the Spanish government in 1981‚Äì82, during the transition to democracy, Calvo Sotelo stated that Spain had not been informed of Gladio when it entered NATO. Asked about Gladio's relations to Francoist Spain, he said that such a network was not necessary under Franco, since \\"the regime itself was Gladio.\\"Calvo Sotelo asegura que Espa√±a no fue informada, cuando entr√≥ en la OTAN, de la existencia de Gladio, El Pa√≠s, November 21, 1990 According to General Fausto Fortunato, head of Italian SISMI from 1971 to 1974, France and the US had backed Spain's entrance to Gladio, but Italy would have opposed it. Following Andreotti's revelations, however, Narc√≠s Serra, Spanish Minister of Defence, opened up an investigation concerning Spain's links to Gladio.Italia vet√≥ la entrada de Espa√±a en Gladio, seg√∫n un ex jefe del espionaje italiano, El Pa√≠s, November 17, 1990 Serra ordena indagar sobre la red Gladio en Espa√±a, El Pa√≠s, November 16, 1990 The Canarias 7 newspaper revealed, quoting former Gladio agent Alberto Volo, who had a role in the revelations of the existence of the network in 1990, that a Gladio meeting had been organized in August 1991 on Gran Canaria island. La 'red Gladio' contin√∫a operando, seg√∫n el ex agente Alberto Volo, El Pa√≠s, August 19, 1991 Alberto Vollo also declared that as a Gladio operative, he had received trainings in Maspalomas, on Gran Canaria in the 1960s and the 1970s.El secretario de la OTAN elude precisar si Espa√±a tuvo relaci√≥n con la red Gladio, El Pa√≠s, November 24, 1990 El Pa√≠s also revealed that the Gladio organization was suspected of having used former NASA installations in Maspalomas, on Gran Canaria, in the 1970s.Indicios de que la red Gladio utiliz√≥ una vieja estaci√≥n de la NASA en Gran Canaria, El Pa√≠s, November 26, 1990 Andr√© Moyen, former Belgian secret agent, also declared that Gladio had operated in Spain.La red secreta de la OTAN operaba en Espa√±a, seg√∫n un ex agente belga, El Pa√≠s, November 14, 1990 He said that Gladio had bases in Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebasti√°n, and the Canary islands. =Sweden= In 1951, CIA agent William Colby, based at the CIA station in Stockholm, supported the training of stay-behind armies in neutral Sweden and Finland and in the NATO members Norway and Denmark. In 1953, the police arrested right winger Otto Hallberg and discovered the preparations for the Swedish stay- behind army. Hallberg was set free and charges against him were dropped. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, a secret force called P-26 was discovered, by coincidence, a few months before Giulio Andreotti's October 1990 revelations. After the \\"secret files scandal\\" (Fichenaff√§re), Swiss members of parliament started investigating the Defense Department in the summer of 1990. According to Felix W√ºrsten of the ETH Zurich, \\"P-26 was not directly involved in the network of NATO's secret armies but it had close contact to MI6.\\"The Dark Side of the West, Conference \\"Nato Secret Armies and P-26,\\" ETH Zurich, 2005. Published 10 February 2005. Retrieved February 7, 2007. Daniele Ganser (ETH Zurich) wrote in the Intelligence and National Security review that \\"following the discovery of the stay-behind armies across Western Europe in late 1990, Swiss and international security researchers found themselves confronted with two clear-cut questions: Did Switzerland also operate a secret stay-behind army? And if yes, was it part of NATO's stay-behind network? The answer to the first question is clearly yes... The answer to the second question remains disputed...\\"Ganser, Daniele. \\"The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland: An Unfinished Debate on NATO's Cold War Stay-behind Armies\\", published by the Intelligence and National Security review, vol.20, n¬∞4, December 2005, pp. 553‚Äì580 print 1743‚Äì9019 online. In 1990, Colonel Herbert Alboth, a former commander of P-26, declared in a confidential letter to the Defence Department that he was willing to reveal \\"the whole truth\\". He was later found in his house, stabbed with his own bayonet. The detailed parliamentary report on the Swiss secret army was presented to the public on 17 November 1990. According to The Guardian, \\"P-26 was backed by P-27, a private foreign intelligence agency funded partly by the government, and by a special unit of Swiss army intelligence which had built up files on nearly 8,000 \\"suspect persons\\" including \\"leftists\\", \\"bill stickers\\", \\"Jehovah's witnesses\\", people with \\"abnormal tendencies\\" and anti-nuclear demonstrators. On 14 November, the Swiss government hurriedly dissolved P26 ‚Äì the head of which, it emerged, had been paid ¬£100,000 a year.\\"Richard Norton-Taylor, \\"The Gladio File: did fear of communism throw West into the arms of terrorists?\\", in The Guardian, December 5, 1990 In 1991, a report by Swiss magistrate Pierre Cornu was released by the Swiss defence ministry. It found that P-26 was without \\"political or legal legitimacy\\", and described the group's collaboration with British secret services as \\"intense\\". \\"Unknown to the Swiss government, British officials signed agreements with P-26 to provide training in combat, communications, and sabotage. The latest agreement was signed in 1987... P-26 cadres participated regularly in training exercises in Britain... British advisers ‚Äì possibly from the SAS ‚Äì visited secret training establishments in Switzerland.\\" P-26 was led by Efrem Cattelan, known to British intelligence.Norton-Taylor, Richard. UK trained secret Swiss force\\" in The Guardian, September 20, 1991, p. 7. In a 2005 conference presenting Daniele Ganser's research on Gladio, Hans Senn, General Chief of Staff of the Swiss Armed Forces between 1977 and 1980, explained how he was informed of the existence of a secret organisation in the middle of his term of office. According to him, it already became clear in 1980 in the wake of the Schilling/Bachmann affair that there was also a secret group in Switzerland. But former MP, Helmut Hubacher, President of the Social Democratic Party from 1975 to 1990, declared that although it had been known that \\"special services\\" existed within the army, as a politician he never at any time could have known that P-26 was behind this. Hubacher pointed out that the President of the parliamentary investigation into P26 (PUK-EMD), the right-wing politician from Appenzell and member of the Council of States for that Canton, Carlo Schmid, had suffered \\"like a dog\\" during the commission's investigations. Carlo Schmid declared to the press: \\"I was shocked that something like that is at all possible,\\" and said to the press he was glad to leave the \\"conspirational atmosphere\\" which had weighted upon him like a \\"black shadow\\" during the investigations. Hubacher found it especially disturbing that, apart from its official mandate of organizing resistance in case of a Soviet invasion, P-26 had also a mandate to become active should the left succeed in achieving a parliamentary majority. Daniele Ganser and the \\"strategy of tension\\" Swiss historian Daniele Ganser in his 2005 book, NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe, accused Gladio of trying to influence policies through the means of \\"false flag\\" operations and a \\"strategy of tension\\". Ganser alleges that on various occasions, stay-behind movements became linked to right-wing terrorism, crime and attempted coups d'√©tat. In NATO's Secret Armies Ganser states that Gladio units closely cooperated with NATO and the CIA and that Gladio in Italy was responsible for terrorist attacks against its own civilian population.Andreas Anton, Michael Schetsche, Michael K. Walter Konspiration p. 175, Springer VS 2014, Peer Henrik Hansen, a scholar at Roskilde University, wrote two scathing criticisms of the book for the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence and the Journal of Intelligence History, describing Ganser's work as \\"a journalistic book with a big spoonful of conspiracy theories\\" that \\"fails to present proof of and an in-depth explanation of the claimed conspiracy between USA, CIA, NATO and the European countries.\\" Hansen also criticized Ganser for basing his \\"claim of the big conspiracy\\" on US Army Field Manual 30-31B, a Cold War-era forged document.Peer Henrik Hansen, \\"Review of NATO's Secret Armies,\\" Journal of Intelligence History, Summer 2005.

Olav Riste of the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, writing for the journal Intelligence and National Security, mentions several instances where his own research on the stay-behind network in Norway was twisted by Ganser and concludes that \\"a detailed refutation of the many unfounded allegations that Ganser accepts as historical findings would fill an entire book.\\"Olav Riste, \\"Review of NATO‚Äôs Secret Armies,\\" Intelligence and National Security, September 2005, 550-551.

Lawrence Kaplan wrote a mixed review commending Ganser for making \\"heroic efforts to tease out the many strands that connect this interlocking right-wing conspiracy\\", but also arguing that \\"connecting the dots between terrorist organizations in NATO countries and a master plan centred in NATO's military headquarters requires a stretch of facts that Ganser cannot manage.\\" Kaplan believes that some of Ganser's conspiracy theories \\"may be correct\\", but that \\"they do damage to the book's credibility.\\"Lawrence Kaplan, \\"Review of NATO‚Äôs Secret Armies,\\" The International History Review, September 2006, 685-686. In a mostly positive review for the journal Cold War History, Beatrice Heuser praises Ganser's \\"fascinating study\\" while also noting that \\"it would definitely have improved the work if Ganser had used a less polemical tone, and had occasionally conceded that the Soviet Empire was by no means nicer.\\"Beatrice Heuser, \\"Review of NATO‚Äôs Secret Armies,\\" Cold War History, November 2006, 567-568. Security analyst John Prados writes \\"Ganser, the principal analyst of Gladio, presents evidence across many nations that Gladio networks amounted to anti- democratic elements in their own societies.\\"John Prado Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA 2006, p. 95, The US State Department stated in 2006 that Ganser had been taken in by long-discredited Cold-War era disinformation and \\"fooled by the forgery\\". In an article about the Gladio/stay-behind networks and US Army Field Manual 30-31B they stated, \\"Ganser treats the forgery as if it was a genuine document in his 2005 book on \\"stay behind\\" networks, Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe and includes it as a key document on his website on the book\\".State Department. US State Department's 2006 response The US State Department published a communiqu√© in January 2006 that, while confirming the existence of NATO stay- behind efforts, in general, and the presence of the \\"Gladio\\" stay-behind unit in Italy, in particular, with the purpose of aiding resistance in the event of Soviet aggression directed westward, from the Warsaw Pact, dismissed claims of any United States ordered, supported, or authorized terrorism by stay-behind units. The State Department stated that the accusations of US-sponsored \\"false flag\\" operations are rehashed former Soviet disinformation based on documents that the Soviets forged; specifically the Westmoreland Field Manual. The alleged Soviet-authored forgery, disseminated in the 1970s, explicitly formulated the need for a \\"strategy of tension\\" involving violent attacks blamed on radical left-wing groups in order to convince allied governments of the need for counter-action. It also rejected a Communist Greek journalist's allegations made in December 2005.

It is based on a cut-down runtime version of Digital Research's GEM/3 graphical user interface modified to run only a single statically built application, the ViewMAX desktop. Support for some unneeded functions has been removed whilst some new functions were added at the same time. Nevertheless, the systems remained close enough for ViewMAX to recognize GEM desktop accessories (\`.ACC\` executables) automatically and to allow some native GEM applications (\`.APP\` executables) to be run inside the ViewMAX environment (without having to install and launch GEM first). Many display drivers for GEM 3.xx could be used by ViewMAX as well, enabling ViewMAX to be used with non- standard display adapters and higher resolutions than possible using the default set of ViewMAX drivers. Also, Digital Research's SID86, the symbolic instruction debugger that shipped with DR DOS 3.xx and provided dedicated functions to debug GEM applications (see \`?Y\` GEM-specific help under SID86 or GEMSID), could be used for ViewMAX as well. Versions Originally named Navigator in beta versions, ViewMAX 1.00 was distributed with DR DOS 5.0 in 1990 to provide an equivalent to DOSSHELL in MS-DOS/PC DOS 4.0. It had a very similar appearance to Digital Research's previous GEM desktops ‚Äì two fixed- size windows. Each window would either contain icons representing drives, directories and files, or a representation of the directory hierarchy. If supported by the underlying operating system (such as DR DOS), file and directory passwords and access permissions were supported. Network drives (including CD-ROM drives) were distinguished through their own icon different from local drives. In 1991 ViewMAX 2 was distributed with DR DOS 6.0. Various graphical improvements were made in this release, including controls with a 3D appearance and user-selectable colour schemes. The directory tree (if enabled) was now shown beside the list of icons, rather than instead of it. Various settings could be stored in a configuration files named %DRDOSCFG%VIEWMAX.INI. For more flexible character set support ViewMAX 2 loaded display fonts from a standard DOS \`.CPI\` file depending on the current code page rather than using a GEM specific character set, a feature also incorporated into FreeGEM since 2005. The DOS/V-compatible Japanese version of ViewMAX, as distributed with DR DOS 6.0/V in 1992, supported DBCS characters loaded by \`$FONT.SYS\` from \`SCREENHZ.FNT\`. Support was added for the DR DOS task switcher TaskMAX; if this was present, applications would be launched as separate tasks, and ViewMAX could switch between them. As TASKMGR in later operating systems such as Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher continued to emulate most of the task switcher API as well, ViewMAX 2 could be used to switch and control multiple concurrently running full-screen DOS tasks under the DR-DOS preemptively multitasking kernel (\`EMM386 /MULTI + TASKMGR\`) as well. ViewMAX 3 was intended to be the graphical file manager for Novell's next version of DR DOS. ViewMAX 3 included support for colour icons, movable and resizable windows, program groups, and background images. If the underlying DR-DOS had the optional multi-user security module loaded, ViewMAX would also provide support for the extended world/group/owner access permission system. Although ViewMAX 3 was part of the DR DOS \\"Panther\\" Beta 1 distribution in October 1992, it was never completed and apparently abandoned in favour to Apple's and Novell's \\"Star Trek\\" team project in 1992/1993, which remained unreleased as well. So Novell DOS 7, as \\"DR DOS 7.0\\" was called in 1994, came without a graphical file manager at all. When Caldera bought the remaining Digital Research assets from Novell on 23 July 1996, initial plans were to revive GEM and ViewMAX technologies for a low-footprint user interface for OpenDOS in mobile applications as Caldera View, but these plans were abandoned by Caldera UK in favour of DR-WebSpyder and GROW. After closing the DR-DOS development center Caldera UK in early 1999, the remaining source code of the ViewMAX 3 beta version was published in April 1999 by the US parent company Caldera Thin Clients under the GPL following continued community request to release the sources, shortly before the company changed its name to Lineo and switched to Linux-based technologies three months later. Various ViewMAX features not previously found in GEM have been incorporated into FreeGEM since then.

Originally released as PC/GEOS, it runs on DOS- based, IBM PC compatible computers. Versions for some handheld platforms were also released and licensed to some companies. PC/GEOS was first created by Berkeley Softworks, who later became GeoWorks Corporation. Version 4.0 was developed in 2001 by Breadbox Computer Company, LLC, and was renamed Breadbox Ensemble. In 2015, Frank Fischer, the CEO of Breadbox died and the operating system was put to a halt until later in 2017 when it was bought out by blueway.Softworks. PC/GEOS should not be confused with the 8-bit GEOS product from the same company, which runs on the Commodore 64 and Apple II.  PC/GEOS  = GeoWorks Ensemble = In 1990, GeoWorks released PC/GEOS for IBM PC compatible systems. Commonly referred to as GeoWorks Ensemble, it was incompatible with the earlier 8-bit versions of GEOS for Commodore and Apple II computers, but provided numerous enhancements, including scalable fonts and multitasking on XT- and AT-class PC clones. GeoWorks saw a market opportunity to provide a graphical user interface for the 16 million older model PCs that were unable to run Microsoft Windows 2.x. GEOS was packaged with a suite of productivity applications. Each had a name prefixed by \\"Geo\\": GeoWrite, GeoDraw; GeoManager; GeoPlanner; GeoDex, and GeoComm. It was also bundled with numerous PCs at the time, but like other GUI environments for the PC platform, such as GEM, it ultimately proved less successful in the marketplace than Windows. Former CEO of GeoWorks claims that GEOS faded away \\"because Microsoft threatened to withdraw supply of MS-DOS to hardware manufacturers who bundled Geoworks with their machines\\". In December 1992 NEC and Sony bundled an OEM version of GeoWorks called the CD Manager with their respective CD-ROM players that sold as retail box add-on peripherals for consumers. The NEC Bundle retailed for around $500.00 with a 1x external CD-ROM, SCSI Interface Controller, Labtec CD-150 amplified stereo speakers and 10 software titles. A scaled-down version of GeoWorks was used by America Online for their DOS-based AOL client software from the time of introduction on IBM compatible PCs until the late 1990s when America Online dropped development for graphical DOS in favor of Microsoft Windows. During that time, the popular single 3.5\\" disk that AOL was distributing on could be hacked to boot the GeoWorks graphical operating environment. IBM released the PC/GEOS-based EduQuest SchoolView network management tool for K-12 schools in 1994. Negotiations to make PC/GEOS an integral part of PC DOS 7.0 failed. GeoWorks attempted to get third-party developers but was unable to get much support due to expense of the developer kit ‚Äî which ran $1,000 just for the manuals ‚Äî and the difficult programming environment, which required a second PC networked via serial port in order to run the debugger. Even though PC/GEOS is referred to as an \\"operating system\\", it still requires DOS in order to load. GEOS and its applications were written in a mix of 8086 assembly (Espire) and C (GOC), both with non-standard language extensions to support the object-oriented design. Under DR DOS 6.0, if TASKMAX was loaded before PC/GEOS, PC/GEOS registered as graphical menu system for TASKMAX. This still worked under the pre-emptive multitasker (EMM386 /MULTI + TASKMGR) provided by Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-DOS 7.02 (and higher), allowing for multiple GEOS and DOS applications to run concurrently. (NB. NWDOSTIP.TXT is a comprehensive work on Novell DOS 7 and OpenDOS 7.01, including the description of many undocumented features and internals. It is part of the author's yet larger \`MPDOSTIP.ZIP\` collection maintained up to 2001 and distributed on many sites at the time. The provided link points to a HTML-converted older version of the \`NWDOSTIP.TXT\` file.) After release of Ensemble 2.01, GeoWorks dropped support for the desktop version to focus on handhelds and smart devices. Geoworks Ensemble won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Consumer Program. =NewDeal Office= A newer version of PC/GEOS was marketed in the late 1990s as NewDeal Office from NewDeal Inc. in hopes of creating a market among owners of i386, i486 and Pentium PCs that could not run Windows 95 or Windows 98 effectively. NewDeal released 3 new versions of NewDeal Office (NewDeal Office 2.5, NewDeal Office 3/98 and NewDeal Office 2000) until it went bankrupt in 2000. NDO or NDO 2000 came with a webbrowser named Skipper or Skipper 2000, respectively. = Breadbox Ensemble = After \\"NewDeal Inc.\\" went out of business, Breadbox purchased the rights in the software from GeoWorks in 2001. Their newest PC/GEOS, 4.x, is now a full productivity and internet suite, including web browser (named WebMagick) as well as email. Other essential programs such as word processing, spreadsheet, flat file database and graphics applications are integrated into this package. On 14 November 2015, Frank S. Fischer, the CEO and owner of Breadbox Ensemble LLC, died of a heart attack, some while after announcing plans to bring GEOS to Android. = Versions = * 1990: OS/90 (Beta Version) * 1990: geoDOS (Beta Version) * 1990: GeoWorks 1.0 * 1991: GeoWorks 1.2 * 1992: GeoWorks 1.2 Pro (with Borland Quattro Pro for DOS with PC/GEOS \\"Look and Feel\\") * 1992: GeoWorks DTP * 1992: GeoWorks CD Manager * 1993: GeoWorks Ensemble 2.0 (new kernel PC/GEOS 2.0) * 1993: Geopublish 2.0 * 1994: Geoworks Ensemble 2.01 * 1996: NewDeal Office 2.2 * 1996: NewDeal Office 2.5 * 1996: NewDeal Publish 2.5 (Shareware version) * 1997: NewDeal Office 97 * 1998: NewDeal Office 98 * 1999: NewDeal Office Release 3 * 1999: NewDeal Office Release 3 Evaluation * 1999: NewDeal Office 3.2 * 2000: NewDeal Office 3.2d (German patch) * 2000: NewDeal Office 2000 (new kernel PC/GEOS 3.0) * 2000: NewDeal Office 2000 for (for a Surf¬¥n¬¥Office PC from Ted Turner IV (MyTurn, Inc.) with help from CNN) * 2001: BreadBox Ensemble Beta Version 4.0.1.1 * 2001: BreadBox Ensemble Beta Versions 4.0.1.x * 2002: Breadbox Ensemble Full Version 4.0.2.0 * 2005 - March: Breadbox Ensemble Version 4.1.0.0 * 2005 - November: Breadbox Ensemble Version 4.1.2.0 * 2009 - August: Breadbox Ensemble Version 4.1.3.0  PEN/GEOS  PEN/GEOS 1.0 was the new name for PC/GEOS 2.0 when GeoWorks released it on 9 April 1992. Alongside the Newton OS from Apple, PEN/GEOS 1.0 on Zoomer devices pioneered PDA technology. GEOS was also used in the low-end GeoBook laptop from Brother Industries and in several of Nokia Communicator models (GEOS V3.0 in Nokia Communicator 9000 and 9110). PEN/GEOS 2.0 was released in 1992, and version 3.0 was released in 1995. = \\"Zoomer\\" devices; Tandy Z-PDA, AST GridPAD 2390, Casio Z-7000 & XL 7000 = PEN/GEOS 1.0 was used as the operating system for the Tandy Z-PDA, which was introduced shortly after the first Apple Newton MessagePad. Palm Computing had been incorporated to create software for this device and shipped its first handwriting recognition software, PalmPrint, personal information manager, Palm Organizer, and synchronization software, PalmConnect, on the Z-PDA. Palm Organizer included the PalmSchedule date book, PalmAddress address book, PalmNotes notebook, a dictionary, calculator, clock, forms calculator, 26 language translation dictionary, on-line help, holiday, and travel information. The device was also sold under license as the AST GridPAD 2390 and as the Casio Z-7000 which was the best selling version. In the USA, Casio sold it under the name XL-7000 without the multi-lingual interface, but added an AOL client and some USA specific help files. These devices were all called \\"Zoomer\\" and were the first PDAs with a connection to the online services CompuServe and AOL. This was made possible through the pre-installed dial-up software CompuServeAOL. = HP OmniGo 100 & 120 = In 1993, GeoWorks released PEN/GEOS 2.0, again based on PC/GEOS 2.0. In 1995, this version of GEOS appeared (running on top of DOS) on the HP OmniGo 100. It featured Graffiti handwriting recognition. The OmniGo is a flip-around clamshell handheld computer powered by a Vadem VG230 integrated PC-on-a-chip. The VG230 chip includes an Intel 80186-instruction set compatible NEC V30 core. It was soon followed by the HP OmniGo 120, which added a high-contrast screen. = Brother LW-Writing System = Brother LW- screen typewriters use PEN/GEOS and are the only version of the operating system that ships with vendor-provided drivers for scanner and it included a GEOS scanning application. In Germany, the Brother LW750ic system is equipped with PEN/GEOS. = Brother GeoBook = In 1997, Brother, in collaboration with IBM, brought the GeoBook series of notebooks to market. GeoBook models NB-60, NB-80C and PN-9100GR used a modified version of PEN/GEOS using the Yago user interface. The GeoBook series was marketed mainly in education and was part of the \\"IBM Eduquest School View\\" strategy. = Nokia Communicator 9000(i) and 9110(i) = In 1996, the Nokia 9000 Communicator smartphone was introduced. This phone uses PEN/GEOS 3.0 and established the smartphone market. Nokia followed with Communicator models 9000i, 9110 and 9110i.  GEOS-SC  GEOS-SC was a 32-bit RISC-CPU smartphone OS & GUI for the Japanese cellphone-market. It was released in 1997. Originally built as GeoWorks' planned future OS and codenamed 'Liberty', GEOS-SC became the basis for cellphones designed by Mitsubishi Electric Company of Japan (MELCO).  GEOS-SE  Alongside this, GEOS-SE which was an OS designed and developed by Eden Ltd. a UK-based company acquired in 1997 by Geoworks. It became the basis of several other devices, most notably the Seiko Epson Locatio which was a multifunction device incorporating browser, PIM software, phone, GPS and Camera. It was launched in Japan in 1998.  References  Further reading * GEOWORKS.

Deech sits as a Crossbench peer in the House of Lords (2005‚Äì) and chaired the Bar Standards Board (2009‚Äì2014). Early life, family and education Born in Clapham, London, Deech is the daughter of a historian and journalist, Josef Fraenkel who was born in 1903 in Ustrzyki Dolne in south-east Poland. She states that she comes from a \\"very culturally Jewish family\\". Her father \\"was born in Poland and fled, first to Vienna and then Prague, from the Nazis\\". He arrived in Britain on 3 September 1939, the day the Allies declared war on Germany. Documents show that he traveled first from Poland to Nazi Germany (Vienna, Prague) and arrived in Great Britain on 3 September 1939. Several other members of their family were murdered in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Her first cousin is Maurice Frankel, Director of the UK Campaign for Freedom of Information. She was educated at Christ's Hospital school, then located in Hertford. She graduated from St Anne's College, Oxford with a first in Law in 1965. Career The Ruth Deech Building, St Anne's College, Oxford Deech returned to St Anne's College, Oxford, in 1970 to be a tutorial fellow in Law, a post she retained until 1991 when she was elected principal of the college. She retired in 2004, and was succeeded by Tim Gardam. The college named the Ruth Deech Building, which was completed in 2005, after her. Deech held many other positions during her career; she served as Senior Proctor of the University of Oxford between 1985 and 1986, as a member of the University's Hebdomadal Council of the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority from 1994 until 2002, and was appointed to a four-year term as a Governor of the BBC in 2002, the same year that she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE), in recognition of her work at the HFEA. After leaving St. Anne's, Deech was appointed the first Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education from 2004 to 2008, dealing with the resolution of student complaints at all UK universities. On 22 July 2005, it was announced by the House of Lords Appointments Commission that she would be made a life peer, sitting as a Crossbencher. On 5 October 2005, she was created Baroness Deech, of Cumnor in the County of Oxfordshirehttps://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57780, and introduced in the House of Lords on 25 October 2005. She delivered her maiden speech on 24 November 2005. In 1999, The Observer newspaper named her as the 107th most powerful person in Britain, and in 2001, Deech was placed at no.26 in Channel 4's \\"The God List\\", which ranked \\"the fifty people of faith in Britain who exercise the most power and influence over our lives\\". In November 2007, Deech published IVF to Immortality: Controversy in the Era of Reproductive Technology, with co-author Anna Smajdor. Between 2004 and 2008, Deech was Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education and a Professor of Law at Gresham College in London, where she gave a series of public lectures on family relationships and the law. In December 2016 Deech argued that Jewish students at UK universities were subject to increasing anti-Semitism. She is a Patron of the activist group UK Lawyers for Israel. Returned family property In 2008, it emerged that Eugeniusz Waniek, a 101-year-old Polish artist and art professor living in Krak√≥w, had in his possession a set of silver cutlery which had once belonged to Deech's father's family, the Fraenkels. Waniek had been a Polish Christian neighbour and friend of the Fraenkels in pre-war Ustrzyki Dolne, a small town near the Polish/Ukrainian border. Deech's grandfather, Moses Fraenkel, owned an oil refinery there had been a long- serving mayor of the town. Nazi German troops raided Ustrzyki Dolne in September 1942, rounding up the town's large Jewish population. Deech's aunt, Helena Fraenkel, managed to pass a bundle of the silverware to Waniek for safekeeping, risking her life in doing so. Other Jews in the town were shot for refusing to hand over valuables to Nazis. Helena was sent to her death in the Belzec concentration camp.

George and Caroline had married in 1795, when George was still Prince of Wales. After the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte of Wales, they separated. Caroline eventually went to live abroad, where she appointed Bartolomeo Pergami to her household as a courier. He eventually rose to become the head servant of her household, and it was widely rumoured that they were lovers. In 1820, George ascended the throne and Caroline travelled to London to assert her rights as queen of Great Britain and Ireland. George despised her and was adamant that he wanted a divorce. Under English law, however, divorce was not then possible unless one of the parties was guilty of adultery. As neither he nor Caroline would admit to adultery, George had a bill introduced to Parliament, which if passed would declare Caroline to have committed adultery and grant the King a divorce. In essence, the reading of the bill was a public trial of the Queen, with the members of the House of Lords acting as judge and jury. After a sensational debate in the Lords, which was heavily reported in the press in salacious detail, the bill was narrowly passed by the upper house. However, because the margin was so slim and public unrest over the bill was significant, the government withdrew the bill before it was debated by the House of Commons, as the likelihood of it ever passing there was remote. Background In 1795, George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George III, married Duchess Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other. They separated after the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte of Wales, the following year. Caroline eventually departed England for the European mainland. On the death of George III on 29 January 1820, George became king as George IV, and Caroline became queen consort. However, George IV refused to recognise Caroline as queen, and commanded British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. Her name was omitted from the liturgy of the Church of England, and George acted to exclude her at every opportunity. In June, Caroline returned to London to assert her rights as queen consort of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. garter belt, part of which hangs down in the manner of a limp penis. George despised her, and over the preceding few years had collected evidence to support his contention that Caroline had committed adultery while abroad with Bartolomeo Pergami, the head servant of her household. The day after her return to England, George submitted the evidence to the Houses of Parliament in two green bags. The contents of the bags were identical; one copy was presented to the House of Lords by the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, and the other was presented to the House of Commons by the Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh. Each requested that the Houses set up a confidential enquiry to examine the contents of the bags. Replying to Castlereagh in the Commons, Caroline's chief attorney, Henry Brougham, demanded that the papers be publicly disclosed. Brougham was in the opposition Whig party and knew that public sympathy rested with Caroline, rather than her husband or the government, which was weak and unpopular. Disclosure of George's own adulterous affairs, or even his scandalous and unlawful previous marriage to Maria Fitzherbert, could destabilise the Tory government led by Lord Liverpool. In an attempt to construct a compromise, Castlereagh and the Duke of Wellington met Brougham and Caroline's solicitor Thomas Denman. William Wilberforce secured time for negotiation by persuading the Commons to adjourn the debate on the bags. However, the negotiations were fruitless; the government offered Caroline ¬£50,000 a year to live abroad as a Duchess, but Caroline insisted on her right to be Queen and dismissed the money as a bribe. Wilberforce moved a motion in the House of Commons requesting that Caroline not insist on all her claims, which was passed by a wide margin of 394 votes to 124. However, the public was still solidly behind Caroline, and she rejected Wilberforce's request. George Canning, who may have been a former lover of Caroline, threatened to resign from the government in protest at the proceedings against her. If Canning resigned, the government would almost certainly fall. In the end, either he was persuaded not to resign or his resignation was refused. His eldest son had recently died and, rather than be involved in the debate, Canning left Britain on a tour of Europe to recover from his grief. On 27 June, the Lords rejected a motion made by the Whig leader Lord Grey to abandon the investigation, and the bags were opened and examined by a committee of fifteen peers. A week later, the chair of the committee, Lord Harrowby, reported back to the Lords. The committee decided that the evidence was of such a grave and serious nature that it should be the subject of a \\"legislative proceeding\\". In reply, Lord Liverpool announced that a bill would be introduced the following day. Bill Queen Caroline sitting in a chair in profile at her trial in the House of Lords. She is wearing an elaborate head dress with large feathers, a style with which she became associated. On 5 July, a bill was introduced into Parliament \\"to deprive Her Majesty Queen Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of the Title, Prerogatives, Rights, Privileges, and Exemptions of Queen Consort of this Realm; and to dissolve the Marriage between His Majesty and the said Caroline Amelia Elizabeth\\". The bill charged that Caroline had committed adultery with Bartolomeo Pergami, \\"a foreigner of low station\\", and that consequently she had forfeited her rights to be queen consort. The debate on the bill was effectively a public trial of the Queen, during which the government could call witnesses against her who could be cross-examined by her own legal advisors. By voting on the bill, members of the Houses of Parliament would be both jury and judges. Caroline would not receive basic rights accorded to other defendants; for example, she would not be informed of who the witnesses were before they were called. It was, said the Times newspaper, \\"a violation of the law of God\\".Quoted in The British people seemed to be on Caroline's side and gave her strong support. George lived a hugely extravagant life on the taxes collected by Parliament, whereas Caroline appeared to live modestly. Satirists and cartoonists published prints in support of Caroline and depicted George as debauched and licentious. She received messages of support from all over the country. Caroline was a figurehead for the growing radical movement that demanded political reform and opposed the unpopular George. By August, Caroline had allied with radical campaigners such as William Cobbett, and it was probably Cobbett who wrote these words of Caroline's: The day before the trial was due to start, an open letter from Caroline to George, again probably written by Cobbett, was published widely. In it, she decried the injustices against her, claimed she was the victim of conspiracy and intrigue, accused George of heartlessness and cruelty, and demanded a fair trial. The letter was seen as a challenge, not only to George but to the government and the forces resisting reform. Trial On 17 August 1820, the trial opened. Amid a large military presence, crowds gathered to watch the peers and the Queen attend Parliament. Once in their chamber, the Lords began the bill's second reading (the first reading was a formality). Lord Chancellor Lord Eldon, acting as the Speaker of the House, noted the absence of several peers, notably Lords Byron and Erskine, because they were either abroad or too elderly to attend. Caroline's brother-in-law, Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex, asked to be excused from participating on the grounds of consanguinity. His request was granted, though his brother, Prince Frederick, Duke of York, announced that he would continue to attend. The first motion was moved by the Duke of Leinster, to the effect that the bill be dismissed. It was an initial test of the government's strength that would gauge support for the King. The motion was lost by 206‚Äì41. During the first day and the next, opening speeches by Caroline's defence team, Henry Brougham and Thomas Denman, were well received. In their speeches, Brougham and Denman hinted but did not state explicitly, referring only to \\"recrimination\\", that George could come off worse because of the bill if his own infidelities (such as his secret marriage to Maria Fitzherbert) were revealed in the course of the debate. In private, the Queen also turned the tables on the King by saying she \\"never committed adultery but once, and that was with Mrs Fitzherbert's husband\\". quoted in In this cartoon, entitled \\"Installation of a Knight Companion of the Bath\\", Caroline and Pergami share a bath. Caroline is showered by a spray of bathwater from Pergami's crotch. The prosecution case, led by the Attorney General for England and Wales Sir Robert Gifford, began on Saturday 19 August. The Queen did not attend. Gifford claimed that Caroline and Pergami had lived as lovers for five years from November 1814. He asserted that they shared a bedroom, were seen in each other's presence arm-in-arm, and were heard kissing. The Queen, he stated, changed clothes in front of Pergami and ate her meals with him. He said that Pergami was a married man, but although his child, sister, mother and brother lived in the Queen's household, his wife did not. The Sunday newspapers the following morning were filled with the salacious details of Gifford's speech. Gifford resumed his attack on Monday 21 August by recounting further outrageous revelations: Pergami and Caroline had been seen together on a bed in a state of undress; she had sat on Pergami's knee in public; she had taken baths accompanied only by Pergami.Gifford's speech quoted in High society did not receive the speech well. They were appalled at Caroline's behaviour, but they were more appalled at George's. By forcing the details of Caroline's life into the public arena, George had damaged the monarchy and endangered the political status quo. Leigh Hunt wrote to Percy Bysshe Shelley, \\"The whole thing will be one of the greatest pushes given to the declining royalty that the age has seen.\\" quoted in The first witness for the prosecution was an Italian servant, Theodore Majocchi. The prosecution's reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian prejudice in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs, and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal. Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury. After Gifford's speech on 21 August, Caroline entered the chamber of the House of Lords. Shortly afterwards, Majocchi was called. As he was led in, Caroline rose and advanced towards him, flinging back her veil. She apparently recognised him, exclaimed \\"Theodore!\\", and rushed out of the House. quoted in Her sudden sensational departure was seen as a \\"burst of agony\\" by The Times,The Times, 23 August 1820 but others thought it the mark of a guilty conscience., , and public placards quoted in The Times newspaper, all quoted in It led her defence team to advise her against attending in future, unless specifically requested. quoted in Indeed, the evidence was so demeaning that the Queen did usually absent herself from the chamber, though she went to the House of Lords. According to Princess Lieven, Caroline passed the time by playing backgammon in a side-room. quoted in Prosecution case Sir George Hayter, 1820 Under examination by the Solicitor General for England and Wales, John Singleton Copley, Majocchi testified that Caroline and Pergami ate breakfast together, had adjoining bedrooms, and had kissed each other on the lips. He said Pergami's bed was not always slept in, and he had seen Pergami visit the Queen wearing only underwear and a dressing gown.Majocchi's testimony quoted in He said that they had slept in the same tent during a trip around the Mediterranean, and that Pergami had attended the Queen, alone, while she was having a bath.Majocchi's testimony quoted in The following day, his astonishing testimony continued with the revelation that when Caroline and Pergami were travelling together in a carriage, Pergami kept a bottle with him so he could relieve himself without having to step down from the coach.Majocchi's testimony quoted in The situation in the House became more absurd, as the Solicitor General asked Majocchi about a male exotic dancer employed by Caroline, after which Majocchi demonstrated a dance by pulling up his trousers, extending his arms, clicking his fingers, and shouting \\"vima dima!\\", while moving his body up and down in a suggestive fashion. The Times newspaper was disgusted and informed its readers that it regretted being \\"obliged\\" to report \\"filth of this kind\\". During Brougham's cross-examination, Majocchi replied \\"Non mi ricordo\\" (\\"I don't recall\\") more than two hundred times. The phrase was repeated so often, it became a national joke, and featured in cartoons and parodies. Majocchi's credibility as a witness was destroyed. The next witness was ship's mate Gaetano Paturzo, who claimed that he had seen Caroline sitting on Pergami's lap, but nothing more, while on a Mediterranean cruise. Ship's master Vincenzo Garguilo testified that Caroline and Pergami had shared a tent on deck and had kissed. Under cross-examination, he admitted that he had been paid to give evidence, but said that the payment was lower in value than the business he had lost through coming to England. Captain Thomas Briggs of HMS Leviathan, another vessel used by Caroline and Pergami during their journey, was also called as a prosecution witness. He said that the two had adjoining cabins on board and he had seen them arm-in- arm. Unlike the Italian witnesses, as an Englishman of some substance, the Lords considered Captain Briggs to be a more credible witness.RA Geo/Add/10/1, bundle 5, quoted in After the conclusion of the cross-examination, however, Lord Ellenborough rose and asked Briggs directly, \\"Did the witness see any improper familiarity between the Princess and Pergami? Had you any reason to suspect any improper freedom or familiarity between them?\\" \\"No\\", replied Briggs. A further witness, Pietro Cuchi, an innkeeper in Trieste, told the Lords that he had spied on the couple through a keyhole, during which he thought he saw Pergami leave the Queen's bedroom wearing stockings, pantaloons and a dressing gown. However, he could not be sure because his view, through the keyhole, was restricted. He did say that Pergami's bed was not slept in, and that both chamber pots in Caroline's room were used. As Princess Lieven observed, the trial was a \\"solemn farce\\". quoted in On 25 August, a chambermaid from Karlsruhe, Barbara Kress, was sworn in. She was asked about the sheets on the Queen's bed: \\"Did you at any time see anything on the sheets?\\", asked the Attorney General. Her response was quietly spoken. Two interpreters, one for the King and one for the Queen, formed a huddle around the witness. The Queen's interpreter claimed the response wuste was not translatable; the King's interpreter was asked to press the witness for a further explanation. The witness broke down, and the proceedings were paused to allow her to regain composure. An eventual translation of \\"stains\\" was agreed. Tory Harriet Arbuthnot wrote in her journal \\"if the Whig Lords do not consider the disgusting details they have heard proof, the Whig ladies may in future consider themselves very secure against divorces.\\" quoted in Caroline's former maid, Louise Demont, testified she had seen Caroline leave Pergami's bedroom wearing only a nightdress, and corroborated previous evidence that Caroline and Pergami had shared a tent and a bath during the cruise. She was also asked about stains on the bed-sheets, but refused to be drawn into details because it was \\"not decent\\". Under cross-examination, she was accused of living in England for more than a year under the assumed name of \\"Countess Colombier\\". Demont's flustered reply mimicked those of Majocchi, as she claimed she could not recall being called by that name. The defence said she had been sacked for lying, and produced a letter written by Demont in which she admitted coming to England on a \\"false pretence\\". Demont's sister, Mariette Brun, had remained in Caroline's service as a maid, and had passed information on her sister to Caroline's defence team. The procession of witnesses continued; a mason Luigi Galdini claimed he had stumbled across Pergami holding Caroline's bare breast in their Italian villa. Coachman Giuseppe Sacchi, who was Demont's lover, claimed that he had found the couple asleep in a carriage in each other's arms, with Caroline's hand on Pergami's undone breeches. Sacchi's testimony was ridiculed in the British press, as \\"the parties being asleep, such a position in a carriage, where the bodies are themselves upright, or nearly so, is beyond all question absolutely and physically impossible\\".The Times, 6 September 1820 Defence case In a letter to the King, the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool summarised the progress of the trial. He said the evidence had made an impression in the House, but the bill was by no means secure. quoted in The Queen was still immensely popular. Over 800 petitions totalling nearly a million signatures were received in her favour. Liverpool warned the King that Majocchi and Demont were discredited as witnesses, and the evidence produced by the defence could damage George severely. The divorce clause was especially unpopular, he wrote, though it might pass the Lords, it would not pass the Commons. He suggested that it be dropped. George would not decide to do so. After the presentation of the prosecution case, the trial was adjourned for three weeks, and the Queen's solicitor, Denman, visited Cheltenham Spa for a break. quoted in Once his identity was discovered, a supportive crowd gathered outside his lodgings. quoted in Meanwhile, Caroline's defence team assembled their evidence. Letters exchanged between them and Italian correspondents show that Colonel Carlo Vassalli, Caroline's equerry, said there was nothing improper between Caroline and Pergami. Caroline shared a room with Victorine, Pergami's daughter, and Caroline's behaviour with Pergami was no different than with other men.RA Geo/Box/11/3, bundle 36, quoted in Interviewed in Pesaro, Pergami himself was prepared to swear that his bed was not slept in because he was sleeping with Demont, and that he had never had \\"an intercourse with the Queen\\".RA Geo/Add/11/1, bundle 32C, quoted in The defence opened on 3 October, with a speech from Brougham. His speech was considered the \\"most magnificent display of argument and oratory that has been heard in years\\", quoted in \\"one of the most powerful orations that ever proceeded from human lips\\", quoted in and \\"one of the most magnificent speeches ever made in this or any other country\\".Letter from William Vizard, Queen Caroline's solicitor, to James Brougham, (RA Geo/11/3, bundle 37) quoted in According to Thomas Creevey, it astonished and shook the aristocracy. quoted in In it, Brougham threatened to reveal facts about George's own life, even if they damaged the country, if it was the only way to ensure justice for his client. He attacked the character of the prosecution witnesses, and claimed that Italian witnesses could be purchased like a commodity. He read from a letter from an Italian correspondent, \\"There is nothing at Naples so notorious as the free and public sale of false evidence. Their ordinary tariff is three or four ducats.\\" He reminded the Lords that Majocchi was forgetful, that Demont was a liar, and that Cuchi was a lecherous wretch who spied on his female guests through a keyhole. He produced a letter from George to Caroline written in 1796, which became known as the \\"letter of licence\\". It appeared to forgive any transgressions on either Caroline or his part, and allow them to lead separate lives. \\"Our inclinations are not in our power,\\" George had written, \\"nor should either of us be held accountable to the other.\\" The defence witnesses included Lord Guilford, Lord Glenbervie, Lady Charlotte Lindsay, Lord Landaff, The Hon. Keppel Craven, Sir William Gell, Dr Henry Holland, Colonel Alessandro Olivieri, and Carlo Vassalli, all of whom swore that there was nothing unusual about Caroline's behaviour. The King was incensed; \\"I never thought that I should have lived to witness so much prevarication, so much lying, and so much wilful and convenient forgetfulness\\", he wrote. quoted in Under cross- examination, Lord Guilford was unable to recall leaving a handsome Greek servant alone with Caroline for three-quarters of an hour, and Lady Charlotte had on occasion said \\"I do not recollect\\", but without the same disdain that had met Majocchi's constant refrain of non mi ricordo.Courier (London) 7 October 1820, quoted in British servants who had been in Caroline's household, including Keppel's valet John Whitcomb, also testified in Caroline's favour. Whitcomb admitted that he had slept with Demont, who was already known to have slept with the coachman Sacchi, thus further ruining Demont's tarnished reputation. A French milliner, Fanchette Martigner, further testified that Demont had told her that Caroline was innocent, and the charges against her \\"were nothing but calumnies invented by her enemies in order to ruin her\\".Martigner's testimony quoted in The trial seemed to be going Caroline's way, especially after Sacchi's testimony was refuted by the nephew of the Duchess of Torlonia, Carlo Forti. Forti claimed that the Countess Oldi (Pergami's sister) sat between Caroline and Pergami in the carriage, which was also shared with Victorine (Pergami's daughter), and so there could have been no intimacy between them. However, the cross-examination of two of the witnesses damaged Caroline's case. Lieutenant John Flynn and Joseph Hownam had both been on the same Mediterranean cruise with Caroline and Pergami. Flynn said nothing incriminating but during the course of the cross-examination, he fainted, which left a bad impression. and separately quoted in Pressed by Gifford, Hownam admitted that Caroline and Pergami had both slept in the same tent on deck because, he claimed, Caroline was afraid of pirates, and wanted a guard in the tent with her. In an attempt to regain ground, Brougham produced two Italian witnesses, Giuseppe Giroline and Filippo Pomi, who revealed that the prosecution witnesses had been paid 40 francs each, and given free food and board. The Whigs now claimed that the trial was tainted as there was prima facie evidence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by paying witnesses for their testimony. Lord Liverpool countered Whig demands to abandon the bill by saying that there was other evidence, from non-Italian witnesses, that could be relied upon. Brougham attempted to investigate the claim of conspiracy further in the hope that it would discover the man behind the conspiracy, who paid for the witnesses and hired the prosecution team. Disingenuously referring to \\"this mysterious being, this retiring phantom, this uncertain shape\\" (quoting Milton's Paradise Lost), Brougham knew full well that \\"this uncertain shape\\" was the King. The King knew it too, and took Brougham's words to be a direct reference to his massive size, as the King was vastly overweight. The Tories challenged Brougham's line of questioning, as they claimed it implicated persons who could not be called as witnesses, and widened the investigation beyond the relevance of the bill. Passed but withdrawn For ten hours over two days, Thomas Denman summed up for the defence. He cited the dishonesty of the principal prosecution witnesses, the evidence of the defence witnesses that contradicted that of the prosecution, and drew parallels between George and the Roman emperor Nero. He said Nero had banished his wife, Claudia Octavia, and taken a mistress in her place. He had then concocted a conspiracy to dethrone, degrade and divorce her, before she was ultimately condemned and killed. A second member of the defence team, Stephen Lushington, then spoke for a shorter time to highlight the main points of the defence case. In concluding the prosecution, Gifford reiterated the claims of Demont and Majocchi, and claimed that they were \\"undeniable proof of her Majesty's guilt\\". A detail from The Trial of Queen Caroline 1820 by Sir George Hayter‚Äîleft to right: Stephen Lushington (in wig with back to painter); Henry Brougham (in wig handing sheet of paper downwards); William Vizard, the Queen's solicitor (on floor beneath Brougham); Lord Chancellor Lord Eldon (seated in centre background facing front); Queen Caroline; Lord Grey (with extended arm). The Lords proceeded to debate the bill. The Whig leader Lord Grey complained that the bill was far removed from ordinary legal practice, and pointed out that, if the Lords passed the bill, the entire process would have to be repeated in the Commons, leading to more public strife. Furthermore, the evidence was insufficient, tainted or contradicted. Even if Caroline had shown Pergami favour, it was within the power of royalty to elevate anyone from a low rank to a high one, and it was a strength of society that any person could rise from the lowest of births to the highest of offices. Indeed, Caroline and Pergami had lived at Naples, where the King himself (Joachim Murat) had risen from humble origins. They had travelled through countries that through the influence of the French revolution had seen the reversal of traditional power structures, with the once-wealthy laid low, and the obscure propelled to distinction. The vote was held on 6 November 1820, three years to the day since Caroline's only daughter, Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales, had died. Each peer rose and said either \\"content\\", indicating support for the bill, or \\"not content\\", to oppose it. The vote was 123‚Äì95 in favour. Though the majority was 28, it was considered a narrow victory. Eleven of the votes in favour were from the bishops who sat in the House of Lords, while many of the votes against were from the richest and most powerful peers. quoted in As seats in the House of Commons were often controlled by rich and powerful landowners, it meant that the Commons were almost certain to reject the bill. Consequently, over the next few days the Lords debated dropping the divorce clause, but the Whigs had spotted a tactical opportunity. Lord Grey now spoke in favour of retaining the divorce clause, since by doing so it made the bill more likely to fail in the Commons. On 10 November, a final reading of the bill took place, and a further vote was held. The bill passed by 108‚Äì99, with a majority of 9. In a highly emotional state, quoted in the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool rose to address the House. He declared that since the vote was so close, and public tensions so high, the government was withdrawing the bill. Aftermath The Queen considered it a victory. Crowds of Londoners celebrated exuberantly in the streets; the windows of government supporters were smashed, and the offices of newspapers that had supported the King were set alight. Similar scenes occurred throughout the United Kingdom. On 29 November, Caroline attended a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral with the Lord Mayor of London, much to the dismay of the Dean of St Paul's. Vast crowds turned out to see her; estimates of the number in the crowd vary between 50,000 and 500,000. Nevertheless, she was still barred from George's coronation at Westminster Abbey on 19 July 1821. She fell ill and died three weeks later. Her husband did not attend her funeral, and her body was returned to Brunswick for burial. With the failure of the bill, the radicals largely lost Caroline as a figurehead of the reform movement, since they were stripped of a cause and Caroline had no further need of them as allies. Once the scandal had died down, the loyalist pro-King party had a resurgence, and became more vocal. It took over a decade and the death of King George IV, for the reform movement to gain sufficient ground to force through Parliament the Reform Act 1832, which regulated the franchise throughout the United Kingdom.

Origin and early history A historic dispute between the Merchant Taylors and Skinners livery companies is the probable origin of the phrase. The two trade associations, both founded in the same year (1327), argued over sixth place in the order of precedence. In 1484, after more than a century and a half of bickering, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Robert Billesden, ruled that at the feast of Corpus Christi, the companies would swap between sixth and seventh place and feast in each other's halls. Nowadays, they alternate in precedence on an annual basis. However, the Oxford English Dictionary attributes an earlier origin: the earliest quoted derivation is there ascribed to Geoffrey Chaucer in his Troilus and Criseyde (1374). From its context it means \\"to hazard the world\\" or \\"to risk one's life\\". The work identifies the ultimate origin to be from gambling on the highest values in dicing: to set on cinque and sice (five and six). William Shakespeare uses a similar phrase in Richard II, \\"But time will not permit: all is uneven, And every thing is left at six and seven\\". The phrase is also used in Gilbert & Sullivan's comic opera H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), where Captain Corcoran, the ship's Commander, is confused as to what choices to make in his life, and exclaims in the opening song of Act II, \\"Fair moon, to thee I sing, bright regent of the heavens, say, why is everything either at sixes or at sevens?\\" In P.G.Wodehouse's Right Ho, Jeeves (1934), the derivation of the phrase is said to be from the \\"hearty argot of the hunting field\\".Chapter 7: \\"Aunt Dahlia, returning‚Ä¶to the hearty argot of the hunting field\\" The phrase is used by Preston Dillard (played by Henry Fonda) in the film Jezebel when he described conditions at the bank of which he was a director. The phrase took on additional meaning during the early 1960s, when debate over Britain's position in Europe under Harold Macmillan centred on membership of the EEC 'Six' or the EFTA 'Seven' smaller independent states. The phrase appears in a few songs, including \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" from the musical Evita, \\"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\\" from Tears for Fears, and \\"Playing With Fire\\" by Stereo MCs. The eleventh studio album from Strange Music front man Tech N9ne was entitled \\"All 6's and 7's\\". The song \\"Sixes and Sevens\\" was co written and sung by Robert Plant. It also appears in the Rolling Stones' song \\"Tumbling Dice\\". The song \\"Sixes and Sevens\\" is featured on Canadian thrash metal band Annihilator's album, \\"Never, Neverland\\". There is an album by Norwegian gothic metal band Sirenia called At Sixes and Sevens(including a song with the same name) where this phrase is used in several songs. The phrase is also used in the 1951 movie Royal Wedding. Keenan Wynn‚Äôs character says, ‚ÄúI say, what‚Äôs the matter with you two this morning? You‚Äôre all at 6s and 7s.‚Äù It also appears in the 1978 movie The Wiz, when Miss One gives Dorothy the silver slippers and comments, \\"Oh, don't be all sixes and sevens, honey\\" to Dorothy as Dorothy is in a state of confusion after killing the Wicked Witch of the East. It is also found in the 1993 film The Remains of the Day. It is also mentioned in the 2002 film Austin Powers in Goldmember by Mike Myers' character Austin Powers to his dad, who at the time were speaking \\"English English\\": \\"oh, the one who was all sixes and sevens?\\" During the second episode of season five of the HBO series Six Feet Under, George uses the phrase to describe his wife's attitude towards him. We also come across the phrase in Sabina's opening monologue from Thornton Wilder's 1942 Pulitzer Prize winning play The Skin of Our Teeth: \\"The whole world's at sixes and sevens, and why the house hasn't fallen down about our ears long ago is a miracle to me.\\"  Later appearances  In The Sopranos (Season One, Episode 3), Carmela Soprano uses the term when expressing her anxiety about a party in her home to Charmaine Bucco, her caterer and friend.

He was a Member of the European Parliament between June 2009 and December 2012, and a Member of the Romanian Parliament from December 2012 up until his conviction in May 2013. Biography Becali was born in an Aromanian family in Zagna, VƒÉdeni, BrƒÉila County, as his family had been deported to the BƒÉrƒÉgan Plain by the Communist authorities because of their associations with the pre-World War II fascist Iron Guard.

Political career At the 2000 Romanian legislative election, Becali was a candidate of the \\"League of Italian Communities in Romania\\" for the seat in the Chamber of Deputies reserved for the Italian minority. He received 16,266 votes (0.15%) countrywide, of which 7,677 in Ilfov County. Nevertheless, he lost to Ileana Stana-Ionescu, who got only 2,943 votes in one constituency. Becali contested the results, but according to Romanian election law, for national minorities, it is not the total number of votes that matters; the individual who gains the largest percentage in one constituency wins the seat reserved for that national minority.Romanian Chamber of Deputies, \\"≈ûedin≈£a Camerei Deputa≈£ilor din 15 decembrie 2000\\" He has led the New Generation ‚Äì Christian Democrat Party (PNG-CD) since January 2004, being its candidate in the 2004 presidential election, receiving 1.77% of votes cast (184,560 votes).Biroul Electoral Central, \\"Proces Verbal privind rezultatul pentru alegerea Pre≈üedintelui Rom√¢niei\\" In his 2004 electoral campaign, Becali used clips of the \\"Mihai Viteazul\\" movie (directed by Sergiu Nicolaescu), whose main character was played by Amza Pellea.

On 19 October 2012, Becali joined PNL, with the support of the party president, Crin Antonescu. He won the election in the 25th uninominal college with 65% of the votes.

During his 2004 presidential campaign one of the main themes of his rhetoric was opposition to sexual minorities, which he voiced over and over in interviews and TV appearances. On May 26, 2006, Becali's personal foundation, the \\"George Becali Christian Foundation\\", along with the Romanian Orthodox Church and 22 NGOs, signed a protest letter calling on the government and the courts to ban the Bucharest GayFest 2006 parade, focused that year on the theme of same-sex unions. A few days later, the Bucharest Court of Appeals ruled, however, that the parade was legal, and it was ensured significant police protection. Becali justified his opposition to the pride parade by stating that he \\"doesn't discriminate against homosexuals\\" but that, \\"They abuse their rights. This is proselytism. They can do what they want in their homes, but not on the streets. I call on the Romanian Orthodox Church to defend the Christian faith and morals\\".Mihai Niculescu, RƒÉzboinicul luminii, √Æn cruciada anti-homosexuali (\\"The militant of light, in an anti-homosexual crusade\\"), Ziarul, 26 May 2006 Becali declared that he intended to pay for a referendum on same-sex marriage, which he believed 99% of people would vote against.

I'll give two or five million dollars [for a referendum], so we can finish off all homosexuals in the country.\\"Becali: 'Dau c√¢teva milioane de dolari ≈üi √Æi terminƒÉm pe homosexuali!' (Becali: \\"I'll give a few million dollars and we'll finish off the homosexuals\\"), 9AM.ro, 2 June 2006 The media commentator Dan TapalagƒÉ, in an editorial at the Cotidianul newspaper, criticized the Romanian Orthodox Church for its coalition with Becali, and its opposition to the gay pride parade, which he sarcastically termed as \\"the sin of the Becalised Church\\".Dan TapalagƒÉ, Editorial - PƒÉcatul bisercii becalizate (\\"Editorial: The sin of the Becalised Church\\"), Cotidianul, 4 June 2006 In an opinion piece written after Becali's inflammatory declaration, journalist Radu CƒÉlin Cristea quoted Cristian P√¢rvulescu, a Romanian political analyst, who described Becali as a \\"populist who practices a superficial form of legionarism\\", referring to the fascist Iron Guard movement which took place in 1930s Romania and whose members were named \\"legionnaires\\" (legionari). Cristea also warned that society and the political class should stop regarding Becali as an \\"inoffensive and amusing clown\\".Radu CƒÉlin Cristea, Gigi Becali ≈üi circul groazei (\\"Gigi Becali and the circus of horror\\"), Cotidianul In October 2006, Gigi Becali was awarded the LGBT community's \\"black ball\\" for the most homophobic personality in Romania, as part of the 2006 Gay Awards Gala which took place during the Gay Film Nights Festival of Cluj-Napoca.Gala Premiilor Gay 2006 (The Gay Awards Gala 2006), GayOne.ro, 4 October 2006. During Bucharest's annual GayFest in June 2007, Becali seemed to have tempered his homophobic stance. He declared in an interview that \\"I love them [homosexuals] in the same way that I love all other people. They can marry at the City Hall, every day, 10 of them if they want to. But in church, they don't have a place.\\" Homosexualii ≈üi lesbienele √Æi criticƒÉ pe Vanghelie, Iliescu ≈üi Becali! , ProTV, 7 June 2007 When questioned about homosexuality in another interview conducted during the 2007 GayFest, he stated, \\"They can do what they want... marry...

ACCEPT, a Romanian gay rights organisation, complained against Becali and Steaua to Romania's National Council for Combating Discrimination that these statements breached Romania's anti-discrimination and hate speech laws. The Council upheld the complaint against Becali. However, it imposed no fine because of a Romanian law that a fine cannot be imposed more than six months after the discriminatory act. The Council dismissed the complaint against Steaua because Becali is not an official spokesperson of the club. ACCEPT appealed the decision to the Bucharest Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal has referred questions of European Union law to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court heard the case on 22 January 2012 and delivered its judgment on the 25th of April 2013, in which it found that homophobic statements regarding recruitment of football players made by a person who is perceived by the public as having a leading role in the football club can constitute direct discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, which is prohibited by the Council Directive 2000/78 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. =Xenophobia= Some of Becali's remarks have been considered xenophobic; for instance, in May 2008, the National Audiovisual Council fined the OTV channel for allowing Becali's \\"aggressive and xenophobic speech\\", which \\"instigated to hate against the Hungarian minority in Romania\\" to go on live, without any intervention from Dan Diaconescu, the talk show host.National Audiovisual Council of Romania, \\"Decizia nr. 420 din 20.05.2008\\" He also believes in a conspiracy of the \\"Hungarian Freemasons\\", claiming that it is they who are financing Steaua's adversary, CFR Cluj.\\"√éi fac pe unguri!\\", in Gazeta Sporturilor, 12 February 2008 In November 2001, Becali and his bodyguards insulted and physically abused Malonga Parfait, the host of the satirical football TV show Fotbal la Maxx.

In July 2005, in a restaurant, Becali cursed, spat and spilled a glass of wine on ≈ûerban Huidu, the creator of the satirical TV show Cronica C√¢rcota≈üilor.

For example, in July 2005, a reporter called Becali to ask him some questions related to the Steaua Bucure≈üti football club. Becali used this opportunity to unleash a flurry of curses addressed to Antena 1 and Dan Voiculescu. He himself said in the dialogue that \\"he is not a civilized man\\". In 2008, he admitted that when he lost money in a casino, he lost his temper and began throwing chairs toward the windows, breaking them.\\"Gigi Becali: ‚ÄúAm luat scaunul ≈üi am spart toate vitraliile din cazinou‚Äù\\" , Cotidianul, 16 September 2008 On April 2, 2009 George Becali was arrested over illegally holding 3 people against their will, because he suspected they were involved in stealing his car.

Becali announced his candidacy for the European Parliament from his prison cell. Nick Thorpe, the BBC's correspondent to Romania, says that many Romanians see him as a victim of crime rather than a perpetrator, and that sympathy about the case undoubtedly helped Becali win a seat in Brussels for the nationalist Greater Romania Party. Romanian judges initially barred Becali from taking his MEP seat due to ongoing police investigation.BBC News, 9 June 2009, Romanian judges bar populist MEP Eventually, the Romanian Supreme Court lifted all bans and Becali was allowed to take his Brussels seat.

Unlike in involuntary commitment, the person is free to leave the hospital against medical advice, though a period of notice, or the requirement that the leaving take place during daylight hours, is sometimes required. In some jurisdictions a distinction is drawn between formal and informal voluntary commitment, and this may have an effect on how much notice the individual must give before leaving the hospital. This period may be used for the hospital to use involuntary commitment procedures against the patient. People with mental illness can write psychiatric advance directives in which they can, in advance, consent to voluntary admission to a hospital and thus avoid involuntary commitment. In the UK, people who are admitted to hospital voluntarily are referred to either as voluntary patients or informal patients. These people are free to discharge against medical advice, unless it is felt that they are at immediate risk, then a doctor can use mental health law to hold people in the hospital for up to 72 hours.In England and Wales this is authorised under Section 5 of the Mental Health Act 1983 People who are detained by mental health law are referred to as formal patients. In Europe, the treatment of mental illness became a health policy priority under the impetus of the World Health Organization Mental Health Plan for Europe elaborated in 2005. This plan promoted a more effective balance between inpatient hospital care and outpatient care through the development of community mental healthcare services. Since the 1970s, the majority of European countries have shifted away from institutionalised care in large mental hospitals to the integration of patients in their living environment through the provision of home and community care services. Germany, England, France and Italy deinstitutionalized psychiatric care in the second half of the 20th century, but the speed and methods by which it was implemented varied, notably due to differences in social and political contexts. In Italy, the reform movement took place a little later. Until the 1968 Mariotti Law introducing voluntary internment, admission into a psychiatric hospital was only by compulsory commitment and was entered in an individual's criminal records.

Visicorp was larger than Microsoft at the time, and the two companies entered negotiations to merge, but could not agree on who would sit on the board of directors. Microsoft Windows when it was released included a wide range of drivers, so it could run on many different PC's, while Visi On cost more, and had stricter system requirements.https://www.computerhistory.org/chess/orl-4334404555680/ Microsoft eventually released its own spreadsheet Microsoft Excel.

In 2020, its population was 21,520. Tauragƒó is situated on the J≈´ra River, close to the border with the Kaliningrad Oblast, and not far from the Baltic Sea coast. Although first mentioned in 1507, Tauragƒó received its city charter only in 1924 and its coat of arms (a silver hunting horn in a red field) in 1997. Notable buildings in the city include the castle (19th c. Russian Empire Customs) (currently housing Tauragƒó Region Museum, Tourism Information Centre), 19th c. Post office, beautiful buildings from the 20th c. inter-war period, several churches: the Lutheran (built in 1843), the Catholic (1904) and Orthodox (1933). Lithuanian, Swedish and Danish factories operate in the city. Nowadays Tauragƒó is famous for its car markets and adventure parks. Names and etymology In Lithuanian, Tauragƒó is a conjunction of two words: tauras which means \\"aurochs\\", and ragas which means \\"horn\\", hence the city's coat of arms. The city is known as Tauragie in Samogitian, as Tauroggen in German, Taurogi in Polish, Tovrig () in Yiddish, and Taurage (; historically Tauroggen [] or Taurogi []) in Russian. History Tauragƒó Old Town Lutheran Church Tauragƒó is situated between two Baltic tribes and at the edge of two historical regions. In 13th c. donations written by Mindaugas, the king of Lithuania mentions that there are lands called Kar≈°uva (Carsovia) and Skalva (Scalovia). In the eve of the Teutonic Order aggression, southwest from the nowadays town, Skalva was situated. It was inhabited by the Baltic tribe Skalviai (Scalovians). To the northeast there was a land called ≈Ωemaitija (Samogitia) with ≈Ωemaiƒçiai (Samogitians) as inhabitants. Kar≈°uva - the region, which existed in these lands, was different because it also had the blood of Kur≈°iai (Curonians) and Lamatieƒçiai (Lamatians) (nearby Baltic tribes). By inhabiting the northern borders of Skalva, Carsovians became close to Skalovians. Even the origin of the name Kar≈°uva (Carsovia) can be linked to the ethnonym Kur≈°iai (Curonians), which is written as Cori, Corres, Kauren in the old historical sources. When the war with Teutonic Order broke out, ethnic and administrative borders started to change rapidly. It is possible that in the end of the 13th c. and the start of 14th c., when Skalva suffered heavy casualties, Samogitians, supported by the rulers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, tried to push to the southwest. But due to non-stopping attacks by the Teutonic Order in the 14th c. they had to retreat. Only in the 15-16th c. when the wars were over, Samogitians came back to their former lands. At that time northern parts of Skalva, which were left for Lithuania, was inhabited by Samogitians, because most of the Scalovians were killed or fled during the attacks of the Order.Almonaitis V., Vakar≈≥ Lietuva XIII-XV am≈æiuje, Kaunas, 2013, p. 106-110 First mentioned in 1507, the town has been a center of Lutheranism in Lithuania. Although it belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, there was an interesting period when the land of Tauragƒó belonged to East Prussian rulers in economical terms. From 1691 until 1795, Tauragƒó belonged to Brandenburg-Prussia, after the marriage of Margrave Ludwig of Brandenburg with Princess Ludwika Karolina Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Afterwards, in 1795, as almost all the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the town became part of the Russian Empire. Tsar Alexander I of Russia, signed an armistice with Napoleon I in Tauragƒó on June 21, 1807, that was soon to be followed with the Treaties of Tilsit. On December 30, 1812, the Prussian General Yorck, signed the Convention of Tauroggen, declaring his troops neutral, that effectively ended the fragile Franco-Prussian alliance during the French invasion of Russia. In 1836, much of the city was destroyed by a fire. Honor√© de Balzac stayed in Tauragƒó in 1843. In 1915, a significant part of the city's infrastructure was destroyed by German troops during World War I. During the independent Republic of Lithuania (1918-1940), the war destroyed town grew rapidly and new modern buildings, factories were built. On September 9, 1927, the rebellion against the authoritarian rule of President Antanas Smetona broke out in Tauragƒó, but the revolt was quickly suppressed. After the Soviet annexation of Lithuania in 1940, the Tauragƒó Castle was a place of imprisonment for Lithuanian political dissidents and POWs. Many local inhabitants, including the parents and relatives of Roman Abramovich, were exiled to Siberia during the Soviet occupation in 1940. This saved the family from the Holocaust. When Operation Barbarossa commenced on June 22, 1941, the Soviets retreated, and Tauragƒó was captured by the German Wehrmacht after heavy bombing on the same day. About 4,000 Jews were murdered in Tauragƒó and nearby villages (about 40% of Tauragƒó population). In the autumn of 1944, the German occupation ended with the Soviets replacing them with a renewed occupation lasting until 1990. During the soviet occupation the town was rebuilt and grew very rapidly, although the pre-war old town architecture was not preserved. Even the old market square and one of the main street Kƒôstuƒçio was completely destroyed and built on. Only some old buildings of the town centre survived to this day.

She is also the player character in the 2020 VR game Half- Life: Alyx. Alyx is portrayed as a young woman in her mid-twenties of Afro- Asian descent, and is a prominent figure in the human resistance against the rule of the alien empire called the Combine and their human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. She is a close friend and ally of the player's character, Gordon Freeman. Character design An early concept drawing of Alyx Alyx's character uses a modified version of real-life actress Jamil Mullen's face, and her voice is performed by Merle Dandridge in Half-Life 2 and its episodes, and Ozioma Akagha in Half-Life: Alyx. Alyx is the daughter of Dr. Eli Vance. Her mother, Azian Vance, who is of Asian descent, can be seen in a family photograph appearing in the games, but is not part of the story. Azian died during the Black Mesa incident (the event depicted in the first Half-Life game). Alyx is a skilled hacker, adept at infiltrating Combine computer systems and reprogramming them. She also possesses a multi-purpose tool that uses an electric charge in order to bypass security systems, open locked doors, and re-program rollermines and automated turrets to attack enemies. Alyx is proficient with firearms, in particular the automatic pistol she commonly carries. At certain points in the game, she also wields a shotgun and mans a stationary sniper rifle. In addition, she has some skill in unarmed combat and will occasionally wrestle off or kick headcrab zombies. Alyx is also very athletic, capable of effortlessly jumping down obstacles and climbing up the side of buildings. Alyx is a generally friendly person, usually making optimistic remarks in dire situations. Rarely does she become hostile towards others, with the exception of Judith Mossman who betrayed the Resistance. She also has a caring side, asking Gordon to be careful when he goes into dangerous areas and feeling sorry for a traincar filled with sleeping Stalkers. At times, Alyx shows a very fragile, scared side that she usually bottles up in order to maintain the situation. Alyx is also very educated, forming opinions on the Combine and the Resistance independently. She has also proven to be very calm yet stern during combat, helping out in any way she can. Alyx has proven to be skilled in shooting, climbing, hacking, and repairing machines and vehicles. She also has a sense of humor, as evidenced by the jokes she makes about the Combine or Gordon's silence.An example of this can be seen in the Lowlife chapter of Episode One, when she begins to make noises like a zombie to scare the player. Upon being found out, she says \\"Ha ha, gotcha.\\" In the same chapter, when Gordon and Alyx come across a zombie created from a normal headcrab and a Combine Overwatch Soldier. Alyx calls the \\"new breed\\" a Zombine, saying, \\"Zombine, get it? Hahaha...\\", then stopping when Gordon apparently doesn't get the joke. \\"...O ------kay.\\" Appearances Alyx helps Gordon more frequently and directly than any other character in Half-Life 2. In the first chapter (Point Insertion), Alyx saves Gordon from Civil Protection forces when he is unarmed and not yet wearing his protective HEV suit. Later, in Black Mesa East, she gives Gordon the gravity gun and instructs Gordon in its use. During the chapter titled Entanglement, she helps search Nova Prospekt for her captured father, Eli. She fights alongside Gordon through a section of City 17 during the armed uprising in Anticitizen One, and provides indirect assistance to Gordon during the final confrontation with Dr. Breen in the final areas of the Citadel in Dark Energy. In Black Mesa East, Alyx argues heatedly with Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx's hostility towards Mossman is seemingly justified: Gordon and Alyx learn in Entanglement that Mossman has betrayed the resistance and given away the location of their hidden facility. Nevertheless, in Dark Energy, Dr. Mossman switches sides again and the two women finally make peace. In the ending scene of Half-Life 2, Alyx is with Gordon at the time of the dark energy explosion. The G-Man stops time to rescue Gordon and put him back into stasis, but leaves Alyx to her fate. In Half-Life 2: Episode One, before the explosion can kill her, Alyx is rescued by Vortigaunts who also retrieve Gordon from the G-Man, leaving them both outside the Citadel. Together, they have to revisit the structure to slow the core's progression toward meltdown, delaying the explosion. Alyx and Gordon stick together for most of Episode One, finally getting out of the zombie-infested underground station to the surface. They soon meet up with Barney Calhoun and make a push for a different train station, saving the remaining rebel members. Gordon and Alyx leave Barney on a separate train and jump on the last train heading out of the City just as the Citadel explodes. In Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Alyx and Gordon travel to the White Forest Rocket Facility to deliver a crucial information packet stolen from the Citadel. Along the way, she is gravely wounded by a Combine Hunter. Healing her requires Gordon to make a dangerous trek through an Antlion colony to retrieve their \\"larval extract,\\" an essential ingredient in the Vortigaunt healing process. As part of the healing process, her life is entwined with Gordon's. During this time, the G-Man appears to Gordon in a surreal \\"heart-to-heart\\" sequence and programs Alyx to tell her father to \\"prepare for unforeseen consequences.\\" Once Alyx awakens, she and Gordon resume their quest toward White Forest. During their second encounter with Hunters, Alyx resolves not to run from them again. Aside from the Hunters, Alyx and Gordon fight numerous Combine soldiers, zombies, a Hunter-Chopper, and have a chance encounter with a Combine Advisor. Upon arriving at White Forest, Alyx is reunited with her father, who suggests that Alyx and Gordon should have children together. She delivers the Combine data to Dr. Kleiner, who manages to decrypt it and discover that Judith Mossman has found the legendary Borealis, an icebreaker ship which has disappeared during teleportation experiments. As Kleiner argues with Eli about what to do with the Borealis, the G-Man triggers her programming; she clearly retains no memory of it upon delivering the message. She arranges transport to the Borealis in the form of a vintage helicopter while Gordon fights off an invasion by Striders. After Kleiner and Magnusson successfully disable the Combine superportal, Alyx and Gordon prepare to board the helicopter. Just as they reach the hangar, however, two Advisors break in and restrain them along with Eli. One kills Eli while Alyx and Gordon remain helpless, but Dog arrives on the scene in time to save Alyx and Gordon. Alyx cries, embracing her father's body and whimpering \\"Please... don't leave me.\\" The screen then fades to black and the credits roll, with her cries still audible for several seconds. Alyx was also featured in a series of promotional images released by Valve spoofing an Apple Inc. commercial. Alyx is the namesake of the 2020 virtual reality game Half-Life: Alyx developed by Valve. The game follows a 19-year-old Alyx's story in City 17 five years before the events of Half-Life 2. Initially performing routine reconnaissance for the Resistance, Alyx is captured along with her father by the Combine after he discovers images relating to an apparent Combine superweapon called \\"the Vault.\\" Russell, a Resistance mechanic, frees Alyx and sends her through the zombie-infested Quarantine Zone outside City 17 to rescue Eli. Along the way, Alyx meets an eccentric Vortigaunt who warns her of Eli's death in the future. Alyx manages to derail the train sending Eli to Nova Prospekt and with the help of the Vortigaunt narrowly rescues him before Eli sends her to find a way to disable the Vault. Through her journey they learn the Vault is not a superweapon but in fact a prison, which they infer based on the information they gather is made to contain Gordon Freeman. When Alyx reaches the Vault, however, she instead finds the G-Man, who in exchange for freeing him offers her a vision of the future: her father's death at White Forest. He grants her the power to kill the Advisor, thus saving Eli's life, but then reveals he was testing to prove her a worthy replacement for Gordon Freeman, who he has grown dissatisfied with for not following his directions. Against her pleas to let her go, he places her into stasis. These events lead to Eli's resurrection at White Forest five years later, but Alyx being removed from time. Gameplay Through parts of Half-Life 2 and almost the entirety of its sequels, Episode One and Episode Two, Alyx serves as an ally to the player, assisting in combat and allowing the player to progress by opening doors and removing other obstacles. Alyx's health quickly regenerates, allowing her to recover quickly and survive a fair amount of punishment. As long as the player does not deliberately avoid helping Alyx, it is difficult for her to be killed. Notably, while Gordon requires the use of the special HEV suit for protection, power, and other abilities, Alyx appears to need no such enhancement. In Episode One, where Alyx's role as a companion is expanded upon, her artificial intelligence (AI) was designed specifically for co-operative play to complement the player's abilities. The developers described Alyx's programming for Episode One as a \\"personality code\\" as opposed to an \\"AI code\\", emphasizing the attention they gave to create a unique and believable companion. In addition, she was specially programmed to avoid performing too many mechanical or repetitive actions, such as repeating lines of dialogue or performing certain routines in combat situations. Examples of this co- operative gameplay include combat in underground levels, where the player can use their flashlight to help Alyx spot and kill oncoming enemies, thereby conserving their own ammunition. Similarly, Alyx will often take up strategic positions and provide covering fire to keep the player safe while they travel to a certain area or perform certain actions. Alyx's primary weapon in the games is a unique automatic pistol resembling a machine pistol in operation and a Glock-series pistol in appearance. Alyx also wields a shotgun identical to the one available to the player in the later part of Episode One. She also uses the mounted Overwatch sniper rifles at various points in both Episode One and Episode Two. In Episode Two she can also fire while Gordon is driving a car if he is moving slowly enough. Reception Since she first appeared in Half-Life 2, Alyx Vance has received positive reviews for both her intelligence and her beauty, among other factors. GamesRadar named Alyx \\"Miss 2004\\" in the article about the sexiest new characters of the decade, adding that giving her the award required no debate amongst the staff and describing her as brainy and strong-willed, as well as \\"relentlessly up-beat, funny, and friendly\\" in the face of peril.

It connects Athens with the cities of Corinth and Patras. Since the 1960s it has been replaced for most of its length with the National Road 8A, a limited-access toll road that bypasses most towns, as the major route to the Peloponnese. The National Road 8A has been upgraded to a motorway, the Olympia Odos (A8). National Road 8 passes along the northern coast of the Saronic Gulf, through the Isthmus of Corinth and further, along the southern coast of the Gulf of Corinth, and ending in downtown Patras. It runs through five regional units: Central Athens, West Athens, West Attica, Corinthia and Achaea. Since the opening of National Road 8A it is mainly used for local traffic in the coastal towns. Original route According to the Government Gazette in 1963, the original alignment of EO8 ran from Athens to Patras, via: Corinth, Kiato, Derveni, Aigio and Rio. Present route Today, the EO8 bypasses Megara, whereas the original alignment ran through the town. In Athens, the EO8 currently runs via Athinon Avenue instead of Iera Odos and Egaleo. Additionally, the EO8a and A8 \\"Olympia Odos\\" runs parallel to the EO8 from Patras to Eleusis, although it bypasses many villages and towns that the EO8 directly serve. The remaining sections of the EO8a (between Corinth and Rio) will be upgraded to be part of the A8, and the EO8 will become a non-motorway detour. Apart from the EO8a and A8, the EO8 has connections with (from east to west) the EO1, EO56, A1, EO58, EO3, EO7, EO31, EO5, EO33 and EO9: the EO58, a short airport road to the Eleusis Airbase, also branches off from the EO8.

Institutional care was the target of widespread criticism during the 1960s and 1970s,Report of the Committee of Inquiry, Socialist Health Association, Retrieved 28 February 2010 but it was not until 1983 that the government of Margaret Thatcher adopted a new policy of care after the Audit Commission published a report called 'Making a Reality of Community Care'Making a Reality of Community Care, Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales, 1986, which outlined the advantages of domiciled care. Although this policy has been attributed to the Margaret Thatcher government in the 1980s, community care was not a new idea. As a policy it had been around since the early 1950s. Its general aim was a more cost-effective way of helping people with mental health problems and physical disabilities, by removing them from impersonal, often Victorian, institutions, and caring for them in their own homes. Since the 1950s various governments had been attracted to the policy of community care. Despite support for the policy, the number of in-patients in large hospitals and residential establishments continued to increase. At the same time, public opinion was gradually turned against long-stay institutions by allegations from the media. Some might argue that such allegations were politically driven and that the deliberate underfunding, mismanagement and thus undermining of some institutions by the government was used as an excuse by the government to shut them down. It could also be argued that although there might have been incidents of where care should have been improved, the care in many such institutions may have been satisfactory or good. In the 1960s Barbara Robb put together a series of accounts in a book called Sans Everything and she used this to launch a campaign to improve or else close long stay facilities. Shortly after this the brutality and poor care being meted out in Ely, a long stay hospital for the mentally handicapped in Cardiff, was exposed by a nurse writing to the News of the World. This exposure prompted an official enquiry. Its findings were highly critical of conditions, staff morale and management. Rather than bury this report it was in fact deliberately leaked to the papers by the then Secretary of State for Health Richard Crossman, who hoped to obtain increased resources for the health service. Following the situation at Ely Hospital a series of scandals in mental hospitals hit the headlines. All told similar stories of abuse and inhumane treatment of patients who were out of sight and out of mind of the public, hidden away in institutions. At the same time Michael Ignatieff and Peter Townsend both published books which exposed the poor quality of care within certain institutions. In the 1980s there was increasing criticism and concern about the quality of long term care for dependent people. There was also concern about the experiences of people leaving long term institutional care and being left to fend for themselves in the community. Yet the government was committed to the idea of 'care in the community'. In 1986 the Audit Commission published a report called 'Making a Reality of Community Care'. This report outlined the slow progress in resettling people from long stay hospitals. It was this report which prompted the subsequent Green and White papers on community care. Aims of the policy The main aim of community care policy has always been to maintain individuals in their own homes wherever possible, rather than provide care in a long-stay institution or residential establishment. It was almost taken for granted that this policy was the best option from a humanitarian and moral perspective. It was also thought to be cheaper. The Guillebaud Committee, reporting in 1956, summed up the assumption underlying policy. It suggested that: Policy should aim at making adequate provision wherever possible for the care and treatment of old people in their own homes. The development of domiciliary services will be a genuine economy measure and also a humanitarian measure enabling people to lead the life they much prefer Three key objectives of Community Care policy: * The overriding objective was to cap public expenditure on independent sector residential and nursing home care. This was achieved in that local authorities became responsible for operating a needs-based yet cash-limited system. * There was a clear agenda about developing a mixed economy of care, i.e. a variety of providers. The mixed economy provision in residential and nursing home care has been maintained despite the social security budget being capped. And there are now many independent organisations providing domiciliary care services. * To redefine the boundaries between health and social care. Much of the continuing care of elderly and disabled people was provided by the NHS. Now much of that has been re-defined as social care and is the responsibility of local authorities. An important point to note though is: that NHS services are free, whereas social services have to be paid for. So how the care you require is defined, that is health or social care, determines whether or not it will be free. The Griffiths Report: 'Community Care: Agenda for Action' Sir Roy Griffiths had already been invited by Margaret Thatcher to produce a report on the problems of the NHS. This report was influenced by the ideology of managerialism. That is it was influenced by the idea that problems could be solved by 'management'. Griffiths firmly believed that many of the problems facing the Welfare State were caused by the lack of strong effective leadership and management. Because of this previous work, which was greatly admired by the Prime Minister, Griffiths was asked to examine the whole system of community care. In 1988 he produced a report or a Green Paper called 'Community Care: Agenda for Action', also known as The Griffiths Report. Griffiths intended this plan to sort out the mess in 'no-man's land'. That is the grey area between health and social services. This area included the long term or continuing care of dependent groups such as older people, disabled and the mentally ill. In 1988 Griffiths said of community care that it was everybody's distant cousin but nobody's baby. Basically he was saying that community care was not working because no one wanted to accept the responsibility for community care. Community Care: Agenda for Action made six key recommendations for action: # Minister of State for Community Care to ensure implementation of the policy - it required ministerial authority. # Local Authorities should have key role in community care. i.e. Social Work / Services departments rather than Health have responsibility for long term and continuing care. Health Boards to have responsibility for primary and acute care. # Specific grant from central government to fund development of community care. # Specified what Social Service Departments should do: assess care needs of locality, set up mechanisms to assess care needs of individuals, on basis of needs - design 'flexible packages of care' to meet these needs # Promote the use of the Independent sector: this was to be achieved by social work departments collaborating with and making maximum use of the voluntary and private sector of welfare. # Social Services should be responsible for registration and inspection of all residential homes whether run by private organisations or the local authority. The majority of long term care was already being provided by Social Services, but Griffiths' idea was to put community nursing staff under the control of local authority rather than Health Boards. This never actually happened. The Griffiths Report on Community Care seemed to back local government whereas, the health board reforms in the same period, actually strengthened central government control. 1989 white paper Caring for People In 1989 the government published its response to the Griffiths Report in the White Paper Caring for People: Community Care in the next Decade and Beyond. This was a companion paper to Working for Patients and shared the same general principles: * A belief that state provision was bureaucratic and inefficient. That the state should be an 'enabler' rather than a provider of care. The UK state at this time was funding, providing and purchasing care for the population * Separation of the purchaser / provider roles * Devolution of budgets and budgetary control =Caring for People key objectives= The White Paper followed the main recommendations of the Griffiths Report but with two notable exceptions. * The White Paper did not propose a Minister of Community Care and * It did not offer a new system of earmarked funds for social care along the lines advised by Griffiths. It did however; identify six key objectives which differed slightly from Griffiths Report. * New funding structure * Promotion of the independent sector * Agency responsibilities clearly defined * Development of needs assessment and care management * Promotion of domiciliary, day and respite care * Development of practical support for carers These objectives required new legislation which was enacted in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. Impact of the reforms The community care reforms outlined in the 1990 Act have been in operation since April 1993. They have been evaluated but no clear conclusions have been reached. A number of authors have been highly critical of the reforms. Hadley and Clough (1996) claim the reforms 'have created care in chaos' (Hadley and Clough 1996) They claim the reforms have been inefficient, unresponsive, offering no choice or equity. Other authors however, are not quite so pessimistic. Means and Smith (1998) also claim that the reforms: * introduced a system that is no better than the previous more bureaucratic systems of resource allocation * were an excellent idea, but received little understanding or commitment from social services as the lead agency in community care * the enthusiasm of local authorities was undermined by vested professional interests, or the service legacy of the last forty years * health services and social services workers have not worked well together and there have been few 'multidisciplinary' assessments carried out * in reality little collaboration took place except at senior management level * the reforms have been undermined by chronic underfunding by central government * the voluntary sector was the main beneficiary of this attempt to develop a \\"mixed economy of care\\" Mental health and community care Under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, people with mental health problems were able to remain in their own homes whilst undergoing treatment. This situation raised some concerns when acts of violence were perpetrated against members of the public by a small minority of people who had previously been in psychiatric hospitals. Conversely, psychiatric patients are three times as likely to be victims of crime than the general public, according to research by King's College London and St George's. The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 was passed so that patients could be individually assessed, and assigned a specific care worker; in the unlikely event that they presented a risk they were to be placed on a Supervision Register. There have been problems with patients \\"slipping through the net\\" and ending up homeless on the street. There have also been arguments between Health and Social Services departments over who should pay. In January 1998, the Labour Health Secretary, Frank Dobson, said the care in the community programme launched by the Conservatives had failed. Personal budgets As Simon Duffy and others have emphasised needs assessments were often distorted so a person's \\"needs\\" were interpreted to fit available resources. The development of personal budgets, where the person was given control of resources, rather than provided with services, was intended to tackle this problem. Winterbourne View BBC Panorama's team in 2011 filmed a fly-on-the-wall documentary at Winterbourne View, which was a private long-term hospital for people with learning disability. This was done in response to disclosures of alleged abuse and of a failure of the authorities, including the regulator to take action on reports of abuse. The broadcast program showed physical and verbal abuse of people, a negative culture of frustration and boredom, and lack of any structured treatment for the inpatients. After this, health authorities promised to reduce the number of placements in large units where people were cared for inadequately, far from home, and on a long term basis. It was planned to have a reduction in the number of these placements, with alternative more satisfactory small scale services provided. However, after four years, the Bubb report highlighted that there had been little change, and proposed the way forward for service improvement. It advocated listening to, and empowering people with disability and their families, and the use of smaller, more local services with different kinds of funding. In March 2015 Norman Lamb, the Minister of State for Care and Support launched a twelve-week consultation process on how the changes to services should be implemented. While welcomed by most, others saw progress as lamentably slow on the identified issues for what amounts to community care for people with learning disability and autism. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, on hearing the outlined plans of the health service on these proposed changes, said: ‚Ä≥Why can‚Äôt we just get on and do it?..To say it‚Äôs going to go into a green paper fills me with horror. It suggests to me that our successors will be sitting round the table in a couple of years‚Äô time having the same conversation.‚Äù References  Further reading  * Atkinson, J.

DAI is one of the most common and devastating types of traumatic brain injury and is a major cause of unconsciousness and persistent vegetative state after severe head trauma.Wasserman J. and Koenigsberg R.A. (2007). Diffuse axonal injury. Emedicine.com. Retrieved on 2008-01-26. It occurs in about half of all cases of severe head trauma and may be the primary damage that occurs in concussion. The outcome is frequently coma, with over 90% of patients with severe DAI never regaining consciousness. Those who do wake up often remain significantly impaired.Vinas F.C. and Pilitsis J. (2006). Penetrating head trauma. Emedicine.com. Retrieved on 2008-01-14. DAI can occur across the spectrum of traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity, wherein the burden of injury increases from mild to severe. Concussion may be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury. Mechanism DAI is the result of traumatic shearing forces that occur when the head is rapidly accelerated or decelerated, as may occur in car accidents, falls, and assaults. Vehicle accidents are the most frequent cause of DAI; it can also occur as the result of child abuse such as in shaken baby syndrome.Smith D. and Greenwald B. 2003. Management and staging of traumatic brain injury. Emedicine.com. Retrieved through web archive on 17 January 2008. Immediate disconnection of axons could be observed in severe brain injury, but the major damage of DAI is delayed secondary axon disconnections slowly developed over an extended time course. Tracts of axons, which appear white due to myelination, are referred to as white matter. Lesions in both grey and white matters are found in postmortem brains in CT and MRI exams. Besides mechanical breaking of the axonal cytoskeleton, DAI pathology also includes secondary physiological changes such as interrupted axonal transport, progressive swellings and degeneration. Recent studies have linked these changes to twisting and misalignment of broken axon microtubules, as well as tau protein and amyloid precursor protein (APP) deposition. Characteristics Lesions typically exist in the white matter of brains injured by DAI; these lesions vary in size from about 1‚Äì15 mm and are distributed in a characteristic way. DAI most commonly affects white matter in areas including the brain stem, the corpus callosum, and the cerebral hemispheres. The lobes of the brain most likely to be injured are the frontal and temporal lobes.Boon R. and de Montfor G.J. 2002. Brain injury. Learning Discoveries Psychological Services. Retrieved through web archive on 17 January 2008. Other common locations for DAI include the white matter in the cerebral cortex, the superior cerebral peduncles, basal ganglia, thalamus, and deep hemispheric nuclei.Singh J and Stock A (September 25, 2006). Head Trauma. Emedicine.com. Retrieved on 2008-01-17. These areas may be more easily damaged because of the difference in density between them and the rest of the brain. =Histological characteristics= DAI is characterized by axonal separation, in which the axon is torn at the site of stretch and the part distal to the tear degrades. While it was once thought that the main cause of axonal separation was tearing due to mechanical forces during the trauma, it is now understood that axons are not typically torn upon impact; rather, secondary biochemical cascades, which occur in response to the primary injury (which occurs as the result of mechanical forces at the moment of trauma) and take place hours to days after the initial injury, are largely responsible for the damage to axons.Wolf J.A., Stys P.K., Lusardi T., Meaney D., and Smith, D.H. (2001). Traumatic axonal injury induces calcium influx modulated by tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels. Journal of Neuroscience. 21 (6): 1923‚Äì1930 Though the processes involved in secondary brain injury are still poorly understood, it is now accepted that stretching of axons during injury causes physical disruption to and proteolytic degradation of the cytoskeleton.Iwata A., Stys P.K., Wolf J.A., Chen X.H., Taylor, A.G., Meaney D.F., and Smith D.H. (2004). Traumatic axonal injury induces proteolytic cleavage of the voltage-gated sodium channels modulated by tetrodotoxin and protease inhibitors. The Journal of Neuroscience. 24 (19): 4605‚Äî4613. It also opens sodium channels in the axolemma, which causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open and Ca2+ to flow into the cell. The intracellular presence of Ca2+ triggers several different pathways, including activating phospholipases and proteolytic enzymes, damaging mitochondria and the cytoskeleton, and activating secondary messengers, which can lead to separation of the axon and death of the cell. =Cytoskeleton disruption= thumb Immunoreactive axonal profiles are observed as either granular (B, G, H) or more elongated, fusiform (F) swellings in the corpus callosum and the brain stem (H) at 24h post traumatic brain injury. Example of APP immunoreactive neurons (arrow heads) observed in the cortex underneath the impact site (E, G). No APP staining was observed in healthy control animals (D). Axons are normally elastic, but when rapidly stretched they become brittle, and the axonal cytoskeleton can be broken. Misalignment of cytoskeletal elements after stretch injury can lead to tearing of the axon and death of the neuron. Axonal transport continues up to the point of the break in the cytoskeleton, but no further, leading to a buildup of transport products and local swelling at that point. When it becomes large enough, swelling can tear the axon at the site of the break in the cytoskeleton, causing it to draw back toward the cell body and form a bulb. This bulb is called a retraction ball, the hallmark of diffuse axonal injury. When the axon is transected, Wallerian degeneration, in which the part of the axon distal to the break degrades, takes place within one to two days after injury. The axolemma disintegrates, myelin breaks down and begins to detach from cells in an anterograde direction (from the body of the cell toward the end of the axon),Cowie R.J. and Stanton G.B. (2005). Axoplasmic transport and neuronal responses to injury . Howard University College of Medicine. Retrieved on 2008-01-17. and nearby cells begin phagocytic activity, engulfing debris. =Calcium influx= While sometimes only the cytoskeleton is disturbed, frequently disruption of the axolemma occurs as well, causing the influx of Ca2+ into the cell and unleashing a variety of degrading processes. An increase in Ca2+ and Na+ levels and a drop in K+ levels is found within the axon directly after injury. Possible routes of Ca2+ entry include sodium channels, pores torn in the membrane during stretch, and failure of ATP-dependent transporters due to mechanical blockage or lack of energy. High levels of intracellular Ca2+, the major cause of post-injury cell damage, destroy mitochondria, and trigger phospholipases and proteolytic enzymes that damage Na+ channels and degrade or alter the cytoskeleton and the axoplasm. Excess Ca2+ can also lead to damage to the blood brain barrier and swelling of the brain. One of the proteins activated by the presence of calcium in the cell is calpain, a Ca2+-dependent non-lysosomal protease. About 15 minutes to half an hour after the onset of injury, a process called calpain-mediated spectrin proteolysis, or CMSP, begins to occur. Calpain breaks down a molecule called spectrin, which holds the membrane onto the cytoskeleton, causing the formation of blebs and the breakdown of the cytoskeleton and the membrane, and ultimately the death of the cell. Other molecules that can be degraded by calpains are microtubule subunits, microtubule-associated proteins, and neurofilaments. Generally occurring one to six hours into the process of post-stretch injury, the presence of calcium in the cell initiates the caspase cascade, a process in cell injury that usually leads to apoptosis, or \\"cell suicide\\". Mitochondria, dendrites, and parts of the cytoskeleton damaged in the injury have a limited ability to heal and regenerate, a process which occurs over 2 or more weeks. After the injury, astrocytes can shrink, causing parts of the brain to atrophy. Diagnosis Diffuse axonal injury after a motorcycle accident. MRI after 3 days: on T1-weighted images the injury is barely visible. On the FLAIR, DWI and T2*-weighted images a small bleed is identifiable. DAI is difficult to detect since it does not show up well on CT scans or with other macroscopic imaging techniques, though it shows up microscopically. However, there are characteristics typical of DAI that may or may not show up on a CT scan. Diffuse injury has more microscopic injury than macroscopic injury and is difficult to detect with CT and MRI, but its presence can be inferred when small bleeds are visible in the corpus callosum or the cerebral cortex. MRI is more useful than CT for detecting characteristics of diffuse axonal injury in the subacute and chronic time frames. Newer studies such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging are able to demonstrate the degree of white matter fiber tract injury even when the standard MRI is negative. Since axonal damage in DAI is largely a result of secondary biochemical cascades, it has a delayed onset, so a person with DAI who initially appears well may deteriorate later. Thus injury is frequently more severe than is realized, and medical professionals should suspect DAI in any patients whose CT scans appear normal but who have symptoms like unconsciousness. MRI is more sensitive than CT scans, but is still liable to false negatives because DAI is identified by looking for signs of edema, which may not always be present. DAI is classified into grades based on severity of the injury. In Grade I, widespread axonal damage is present but no focal abnormalities are seen. In Grade II, damage found in Grade I is present in addition to focal abnormalities, especially in the corpus callosum. Grade III damage encompasses both Grades I and II plus rostral brain stem injury and often tears in the tissue. Treatment DAI currently lacks specific treatment beyond that for any type of head injury, which includes stabilizing the patient and trying to limit increases in intracranial pressure (ICP). History The idea of DAI first came about as a result of studies by Sabina Strich on lesions of the white matter of individuals who had suffered head trauma years before. Strich first proposed the idea in 1956, calling it diffuse degeneration of white matter, however the more concise term \\"Diffuse Axonal Injury\\" was eventually preferred. Strich was researching the relationship between dementia and head trauma and asserted in 1956 that DAI played an integral role in the eventual development of dementia due to head trauma. The term DAI was introduced in the early 1980s.

He was a delegate for North Carolina to the Continental Congress from 1778 to 1780 and served as Speaker of the North Carolina House of Commons in 1778. Early life Whitmell was the son of a John and Martha Hill, and was born in Bertie County, North Carolina. In 1760 he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and returned to North Carolina to begin developing his own plantation, Hill‚Äôs Ferry, in what was to become Martin County when it was established in 1774. Service in the American Revolution Service record: * Lt. Colonel in the Martin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1775-1778) * Colonel over the Martin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1778 & 1781-1783) * North Carolina delegate to the Continental Congress (1778-1780) Hill supported the rising revolutionary sentiment, and when the Martin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia was organized he was named its Lieutenant Colonel, and was later its Colonel in 1778. When the revolutionary North Carolina Provincial Congress met in 1775-1776 he represented Martin County. Then, in 1776 he was advanced to the Provincial Council to represent the Edenton district. During this time he was also a member of the local Committee of Safety. Political career Once North Carolina wrote its new Constitution, Hill was elected to the state Senate, and served as speaker in 1778. Later that year the Assembly named him as one of the state's delegates to the Continental Congress. He was returned to the Congress until 1781, when the term limit imposed by the state constitution prevented his reappointment. He was re-elected to the state Senate in 1783, 1784, and 1788. In 1788 he was also a delegate to North Carolina's Hillsborough Convention to consider ratification of the U.S. Constitution. His outspoken support helped strengthen the forces that ultimately completed ratification the following year in Fayetteville. Death Hill died and was buried at his home, Hill‚Äôs Ferry, in northwestern Martin County. In 1887 his grave was moved to the Trinity Cemetery, near Scotland Neck in Halifax County, North Carolina.

It carries the final segment of Interstate 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) from South Boston towards its eastern terminus at Route 1A in East Boston, slightly beyond Logan International Airport. The tunnel is named after the former Boston Red Sox baseball legend and U.S. Marine air corps veteran Ted Williams. History Map showing the Williams tunnel (shown in red) The Ted Williams Tunnel (TWT) was the first major link constructed as part of Boston's Big Dig. It is constructed from twelve \\"binocular\\" shaped steel sections fabricated in a Baltimore shipyard. These sections were then brought to the Black Falcon Pier near the site and each was fitted with a large surrounding mass of concrete (so that the tunnel section was more neutrally buoyant). Using additional flotation, the tunnel sections were then floated into place, lowered into a dredged channel, and joined to the other sections. At this point, the steel panels sealing the now-joined sections could be cut out and the finishing operations could be completed. When the TWT opened in 1995 it was only available to authorized commercial traffic. Later, non-commercial traffic was allowed to access the tunnel on weekends and holidays. In 2003, with the substantial completion of the I-90 portion of the Big Dig, the tunnel was opened to all traffic at all times. The tunnel is long, of which approximately are underwater. A toll is collected in both directions, through the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system, formerly named the \\"Fast Lane\\" system. Vehicles with a Massachusetts E-ZPass transponder pay $1.75, and the tolls are higher for vehicles with an out of state E-ZPass or vehicles without an E-ZPass. Eligible Boston residents for the E-ZPass discount program pay $0.20 for either direction. Commercial vehicles pay higher, depending on number of axles. Big Dig ceiling collapse Traffic detoured onto I-93 at the South Bay Interchange after collapse. On July 10, 2006 at approximately 11 p.m. four three-ton sections of a concrete drop ceiling inside the I-90 Fort Point Channel tunnel leading to the Ted Williams Tunnel collapsed. A section of ceiling fell on top of a car traveling through the connector tunnel, killing 38-year-old passenger Milena Del Valle and slightly injuring her husband Angel Del Valle, who was driving. The cause of the collapse was later determined to be the failure of adhesives connecting a steel tieback suspending the concrete drop ceiling to the main ceiling above. Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney ordered the eastbound lanes of the Ted Williams Tunnel to be immediately shut down on July 20 after two ceiling supports showed signs of slippage. At a press conference, Romney stated that \\"pull tests\\" were to be conducted in the eastbound tube to test the stress load on the bolt/epoxy system that supports the drop ceiling. An independent contracting firm was to conduct that test. Romney said the shutdown should last \\"hours, not days\\". The next morning, the eastbound lanes of the tunnel were opened to MBTA Silver Line buses as well as commercial buses running to Logan Airport. Late in the evening of August 8, I-90 connector ramp A leading to the Ted Williams Tunnel was reopened to general traffic, easing the crunch on Logan Airport traffic coming from the south. Cars heading to the airport northbound on the Southeast Expressway (I-93) would get off at exit 18 and take the South Boston Access (Haul) Road to Ramp A, eliminating the need to go through downtown Boston and U-turn at Storrow Drive to access the Callahan Tunnel. One eastbound lane of the connector tunnel which collapsed was reopened to traffic on September 1.

These rhizomatous perennial plants are noted for their unique bird-attracting flowers. The tubular flowers are coated with dense hairs and open at the apex with six claw-like structures, and it is from this paw-like formation that the common name \\"kangaroo paw\\" is derived. The kangaroo paw plant has been introduced into Japan and has been grown as a new ornamental crop mainly in Okinawa Island under a subtropical climate.Satou, Ichinoe, Fukumoto, Tezuka, & Horiuchi. (2001). Fusarium blight of kangaroo paw (anigozanthos spp.) caused by fusarium chlamydosporum and fusarium semitectum.Journal of Phytopathology, 149(3‚Äê4), 203-206. doi:10.1046/j.1439-0434.2001.00588.x  History  The genus Anigozanthos' author was French botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardi√®re, who first collected the Kangaroo Paw in 1792 near Esperance. Red and green kangaroo paw was introduced to England in 1833, and was first described in 1836 by botanist David Don. The specific name manglesii is so named in honour of the first individual to raise the specimen from seed, Robert Mangles, which he did in his English garden. His experience with growing the specimen is recorded in letters to his brother James Mangles. The red and green kangaroo paw was adopted as the state emblem of Western Australia in a proclamation on 9 October 1960. An image of red and green kangaroo paw was superimposed onto a view of Perth from a distance on a 5 pence stamp, issued 1 November 1962, commemorating the Seventh British Empire and Commonwealth Games which were in that year held in Perth. The stamp was designed by R. M. Warner. The red and green kangaroo paw was again included on a stamp on 10 July 1968, which were six cent stamps in a series of state floral emblems. It was designed by Nell Wilson. In 1990, disease was found on the kangaroo paw plant in Okinawa. The unreported fungi, which associated the plant becoming very limp and wilt, was characterised by a discolouration of the plant leaving it a brown to black colour around the stalks, leaves and base of the plant. As the plant began to discolour over time, white cottony mycelia started to appear at the surface of the lesions and then the plant eventually died.  Cultivation and Cut Flowers  The plant is native to south-western Australia, occurring naturally from the Murchison River in the North to Busselton and Mount Barker in the South, and Lake Muir to the East. It has been developed as a cut-flower crop in the United States, Israel and Japan. In Israel, plants are propagated from tissue culture imported from Australia and are then grown in unheated greenhouses in natural day conditions.Tsror (Lahkim), L., Hazanovsky, M., Mordechai‚ÄêLebiush, S., Ben‚ÄêDavid, T., Dori, I., & Matan, E.

Journal of Phytopathology, 153(3), 150-154. doi:10.1111/j.1439-0434.2005.00944.x The plants have found their way to California and become popular among garden supply businesses there. = Research = Research leading up to 2020 has been able to produce many new colours for the Kangaroo paw including blues, purples, whites, and many more. This has lead to genetic research and DNA sequencing similar to that carried out on Snapdragons to understanding the colours of the flower. Other research has been conducted that indicates the spores from the plant could regenerate and reactive skin firmness as it targets the young cells at the source with increased collagen output.

The manuscript bears the title \\"Fourth Mephisto Waltz\\"Howard, Waltzes, 1, 3. and may have been intended to replace the piece now known as the Fourth Mephisto Waltz when it appeared Liszt would not be able to finish it; the phrase Bagatelle ohne Tonart actually appears as a sub-title on the front-page of the manuscript. The Bagatelle is a waltz in a typical sectioned dance form, with repeated sections given inventive variation. While this piece is not especially dissonant, it is extremely chromatic, becoming what Liszt's contemporary Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis called \\"omnitonic\\"Biographie universelle des musiciens‚Ä¶, p. 113 in that it lacks any definite feeling for a tonal center.Searle, New Grove 11:11:39. Some critics have suggested, however, that the various underpinnings of the piece‚Äîin other words, the main bass notes and melodic elements‚Äîwork together to imply an underlying tonality of D,Baker, 117. which would link the Bagatelle in terms of tonality with the Fourth Mephisto Waltz.Baker, 118-19. Overview =Program= The Bagatelle, like the Mephisto Waltzes, could be considered a typical example of program music, taking for its program an episode from Faust, not by Goethe but by Nikolaus Lenau (1802‚Äì1850). The following program note, which Liszt took from Lenau, appears in the printed score of the Mephisto Waltz No. 1: > There is a wedding feast in progress in the village inn, with music, > dancing, carousing. Mephistopheles and Faust pass by, and Mephistopheles > induces Faust to enter and take part in the festivities. Mephistopheles > snatches the fiddle from the hands of a lethargic fiddler and draws from it > indescribably seductive and intoxicating strains. The amorous Faust whirls > about with a full-blooded village beauty in a wild dance; they waltz in mad > abandon out of the room, into the open, away into the woods. The sounds of > the fiddle grow softer and softer, and the nightingale warbles his love- > laden song.\\"Quoted in Ewen, 519-20. =Form= Written in waltz form, the Bagatelle remains one of Liszt's most adventurous experiments in pushing beyond the bounds of tonality, concluding with an upward rush of diminished sevenths. Some have analyzed the piece as being constructed around a symmetrical chord‚Äîthe G diminished chord with which the work ends‚Äîwith the B‚ÄìF tritone symbolizing Mephistopheles as part of this chord.Baker, 116-17. The lack of a definite key feeling, these critics continue, is due to the piece's reliance on mainly tritone and diminished seventh harmony, as well as the piece's ending in an indefinite manner.Serle, Music, 115. The main theme, marked Scherzando, alternates between F and F, suggesting an oscillation traditional between major and minor modes. Consequently, the main elements of this melody, E and A, combine with C in the bass to project what would traditionally be considered the dominant here. A contrasting appassionato section contains a bass line of C‚ÄìD‚ÄìE‚ÄìE‚ÄìF, that conforms with a standard tonal progression in D minor. Moreover, the motivic activity between this bass line and the melodic features of the introduction strengthens the significance of D as a tonal center, overriding sectional contrasts. The second half of this work is basically a repeat of the first half with glittering variations based for the most part on the harmonic underpinning. The fact the Fourth Mephisto Waltz is written in D major confirms to some critics that Liszt may have intended this work to replace it and that it was indeed written in 1885.Baker, 117-18. =Premiere and publication= Unlike the Third and Fourth Mephisto Waltzes, the Bagatelle received its premiere within Liszt's lifetime, by his pupil Hugo Mansfeldt in Weimar on June 10, 1885.Walker, The Final Years, 445-46. Like the Fourth Mephisto Waltz, however, it was not published until 1955. See also * Mephisto Waltzes * Mephisto Polka References Bibliography * ed.

Following a decision of the board taken on July 28, 2005, he was succeeded on January 1, 2006, by Chrysler frontman Dieter Zetsche. Schrempp was the architect of the merger joint venture between Daimler Benz and Chrysler, which ultimately ended in failure when Chrysler was sold in 2007.  Career  During his tenure, Daimler-Benz made the 80% acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation to become DaimlerChrysler. Schrempp called the merger a \\"match made in heaven\\". In addition to the acquisition of Chrysler, Schrempp pursued the acquisition of Mitsubishi Motors as part of his 'Three Pillars' strategy to expand the reach of Daimler-Benz into the major markets of the United States and Asia. In 2004, the Mitsubishi investment became a liability with the Japanese manufacturer swamped under a mountain of debt and following a refusal by other members of the Japanese Mitsubishi keiretsu to assist Daimler in funding its operation. The German company eventually walked away with substantial losses. On 14 May 2007, Daimler sold 80% of Chrysler to the private equity firm Cerberus. Before becoming the CEO of Daimler-Benz in 1995, Schrempp headed the aerospace division of Daimler-Benz, then called DASA, which is EADS today. DASA acquired the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker that was already in difficulty in 1993 after it signed a contract stating the intention to take Fokker over on October 30, 1992. Schrempp called Fokker his \\"love baby\\". On January 22, 1996, after having subsidized the losses of Fokker with billions of Deutsche Marks, Daimler-Benz decided to stop putting more money into Fokker, and the firm subsequently went bankrupt.

Sinar's view-cameras allow both the lens and the film back or sensor back to move in rotation or linearly in any direction (up/down, left/right, front back linearly, and pitch yaw tilt rotations), thus allowing precise image alignment corrections. The cameras are thus often used in advertising, document reproduction, product and architectural photography, where correctly vertical image lines, fine focus accuracy, and extra details are wanted. The name SINAR is explained by the company itself as \\"Still, Industrial, Nature, Architectural and Reproduction photography\\" in the English version of the April 2011 press release.http://www.sinar.ch/de/downloads/category/22-sinar- pressemitteilungen?download=118%3Asinar-photography-ag-acquires-the-brand- rights-of-sinar-ag Other versions of the names were also used, with the S for studio, Sache, or science. In the Indonesian language, \\"Sinar\\" translates into English as \\"Light Ray\\". Founding The business recalls its roots to Swiss photographer who worked in Marseille from 1865 to 1878. In 1879 and 1892 Koch also established two family-owned photography studios in Schaffhausen. Koch worked as a portrait, landscape and alpine photographer and was considered one of the first Swiss champions of alpine photography. From 1894 until his death in 1897, Koch was also president of the Swiss Photographers Association. His son Hans-Carl, expanded the family-owned photography studios to include from 1911 photographic retailing. In 1947, the grandson of Koch senior‚ÄîCarl Hans‚Äîa graduate photographer and photographic salesman, took over the family business on the early death of his father Hans-Carl, and founded the following year the Sinar company. Dissatisfied with the limited or imprecise nature of wooden view cameras (e.g. the large Kodak 3 and similar, and the popular Graphlex Graphic Graphlok series) and the limitations of technical (e.g., Linhof Technika) and field cameras of the day he developed a modular camera and received in 1947 a patent for his Sinar camera. His main aims were to produce a large format camera of high precision and simple operation, with a system of parts that were readily interchangeable. The Sinar system's versatility is based on the interchangeability of parts as well as a large number of accessories that have been produced over the years. Major components (rails, bellows, lensboards, and standards) made in the 1940s are still usable with currently manufactured Sinar equipment. In 1968 Carl Hans' son entered the family business and the company's camera production moved to Feuerthalen (north of Zurich). Sinar moved its base of operations to Zurich after separating from Jenoptik in October 2009. On November 26, 2013 Leica Camera AG took over Sinar Photography AG. P-series The Sinar P, introduced in 1970, had asymmetric tilts and swings, as opposed to the traditional center or base tilts. This permitted rapid and precise settings without losing sharpness on the axis. The P series also introduced features such as self-arresting rack and pinion gearing and a precision-engineered quick format change system that allows the photographer to switch between 4x5/5x7/8x10 formats quickly without having to fully disassemble the rear standard. This was accomplished by using a common rear standard bearer and unlocking a single knob to switch among the various format frames. Another new feature implemented in the P series was the Sinar system of calculating swings and tilts as well as the Sinar depth of field calculator. A key feature of the Sinar P system, particularly in the domain of scientific and industrial photography, is the precise machine tolerances that are part of the fittings and movements. F-series The F series was the light-weight version (\\"F\\" for \\"Field\\"), offering less refined features than the P series. The weight difference is about 3.3 kg for the Sinar F 4x5 vs. 5.9 kg for the Sinar P 4x5. The original Sinar F is easily identified by a brushed aluminum monorail and other aluminum accents, while the Sinar F1, F2, and F3 models were made of the same materials, but painted black. The Sinar F also has hard plastic knobs, versus the rubber-coated knobs of the F1 and F2. The Sinar F and F1 models have a clip-on front standard (lens standard) that does not fully enclose the monorail. The advantage is that this standard can easily be removed from the rail by loosening the clamp and lifting straight up, unlike the rear standard, and it is somewhat lighter weight. The disadvantage of this design is that the rail clamping mechanism is susceptible to breakage if over-tightened. The Sinar F2 and F3 models have a different front standard, which completely encloses the rail and also provides a geared focus adjustment, similar to the rear rail clamp on all Sinar F models. The correct F2 standard can easily be identified as it is a mirror image of the rear standard. The earlier F/F1 front standard has a low-profile metal hinge below the rail. The F2 and F3 models also came standard with a light-metering back, while this was an option for the F and F1 models. The F3 model is a digital/analog model that supports a variety of Sinar digital lenses and digital backs. Accessories Sinar has manufactured many accessories since its establishment: A swing-out filter holder that allows the photographer to use a polarizing filter as well as 4x4 inch gel filters. A 4x5 reflex attachment that employed an adjustable mirror for the best possible viewing of the image. Adapters (now discontinued) were made by Sinar to adapt this viewer to various other view camera makes such as Plaubel, Linhof, and Toyo. The Zoom series of roll film backs, which allow the use of 120/220 film formats from 6x4.5 to 6x12 formats with excellent film flatness. The earlier versions of the Zoom film backs are usable on any 4x5 camera with an international (Graflok) back (later holders no longer have the Graflok grooves required). The Sinar LCD shutter system enables their ccd camera backs to have a much extended density range in video mode for focusing capability in a wider range of ambient lighting. This system has been used in modified mode by RIT to obtain multispectral images suited to aging analysis of color pigments in artworks. Integration of Canon and Nikon SLR cameras as camera backs onto the P standard with adaptors from fellow Swiss camera accessories manufacturer, Foba. Self-cocking shutters, lens-independent, automatic, with built-in apertures. Film plane metering probes and meters. Digital backs for the high- end studio environments.

History and amenities Shottery has a village hall, one secondary school, Stratford Girls' Grammar School, and one small primary school, Shottery St Andrew's CofE Primary School that has been open since the mid-19th century. The school has been threatened with closure numerous times due to local spending cuts, however locals have always managed to raise the funds required to keep the school open. There is one pub (The Bell Inn), and the Santa Lucia Italian cuisine restaurant, opposite the pub, which has now closed. The latter building has long served as an eatery, and in Victorian times was a temperance movement soup kitchen. There was a Shottery Village Stores and Post Office, but it closed in the 1990s and is now a private home. The local park, Shottery Fields, contains two football pitches and a children's play area. The Fields retain distinctive \\"ditch and furrow\\" undulations, marking medieval field systems, and these can be seen when the sun is low across the Fields. The Fields also contain a footpath to the town centre. Shottery has a Rugby Club, Shottery RFC, which is now based at Stratford Rugby Club's ground, Pearcecroft, on the Loxley Road, south Stratford. The club was founded by the Reverend David Capron, Vicar of St Andrew's church in the year 1984. Shottery was the childhood home of Anne Hathaway, William Shakespeare's wife, and is the location of the building known as Anne Hathaway's Cottage which is a very popular tourist destination. The authenticity of the building as the home of Anne Hathaway is, however, not credited by Shakespearean scholars. Governance Shottery is presently part of the civil parish of Stratford-upon-Avon, the \\"Hathaway\\" ward of Stratford- on-Avon District Council and the \\"Stratford West\\" division of Warwickshire County Council.

Callahan Jr. Tunnel (colloquially Callahan Tunnel) is one of four tunnels, and one of three road tunnels, beneath Boston Harbor in Boston, Massachusetts. It carries motor vehicles from the North End to Logan International Airport and Route 1A in East Boston. Ordinarily, this tunnel is only used to carry traffic out of the city, and with the completion of the Big Dig it only collects traffic from I-93 southbound (right after traffic merges from Storrow Drive) and downtown Boston; northbound traffic uses the parallel Sumner Tunnel. As of 2016, a toll of $1.50 is charged for non-commercial two-axle vehicles with a Massachusetts E-ZPass, while non- Massachusetts E-ZPass holders are charged $1.75. Vehicles without E-ZPass are charged $2.05 through MassDOT's Pay By Plate MA program. For residents of certain Boston ZIP codes, a discount is in effect using an E-ZPass transponder, costing $0.20. Alternatives Traffic flowing between Logan International Airport and directions south of the city on I-93 and west of the city on the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) normally uses the Ted Williams Tunnel rather than the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels. Airport traffic can also use East Boston surface roads to and from Chelsea (Chelsea Street Bridge), Revere (Massachusetts Route 1A) and Winthrop (Massachusetts Route 145). History Map showing the Callahan Tunnel (in red) The tunnel was opened in 1961. It was named for the son of Turnpike chairman William F. Callahan, who was killed in Italy days before the end of World War II. In 2016, cashless tolling systems were installed in both directions, entering the Sumner Tunnel and exiting the Callahan Tunnel as part of a plan to modernize toll collection the Boston area. Historically, control signals were used to reverse the direction of one lane in this tunnel or the Sumner Tunnel, when the opposite tunnel was closed for maintenance or emergencies. Under the relevant Turnpike regulations, a yellow signal light means \\"proceed only as directed\\", on penalty of a $50 fine. As the signals are almost always yellow, this rule is universally ignored by drivers. Other markings in the tunnel include a \\"double white line\\" in the center, intended to discourage drivers from changing lanes, to be penalized with a $100 fine. The Callahan Tunnel was repaired in the 1990s. A major overhaul began in December 2013, which completely replaced the deck, curbs, and wall panels; and cleaned and repaired its ceiling and vent systems (above the ceiling and below the deck). It was planned for three phases: complete closure from December 27, 2013 to March 12, 2014 during deck and curb replacement; closures 11pm-5am from March 13, 2014 to late August 2014 for wall panel replacement; and final work until November 2014. McCourt Construction of South Boston was awarded the $19.3 million contract in August. During closures, Logan-bound traffic was diverted into the Ted Williams Tunnel, Tobin Bridge, and Massachusetts Route 1A South via Revere or East Boston. Starting with the Accelerated Bridge Program in the late 2000s, MassDOT began employing accelerated construction techniques, in which it signed contracts with incentives for early completion and penalties for late completion, and used intense construction during longer periods of complete closure to shorten the overall project duration and reduce cost. These techniques were also used for the Callahan Tunnel Rehabilitation Project. References See also * Sumner Tunnel * Ted Williams Tunnel * Thomas P.

His house still stands and can be seen in the ruins of the city of Pompeii which remain after being partially destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. This house is known for its beauty, along with some material found about bank book-keeping and wax tablets, which were receipts. He is well known for being a central character in the Cambridge Latin Course series.  Life  Bust of L. Caecilius Iucundus. The Pompeian banker Caecilius was born around the end of Augustus's reign (c. 14 AD) to a freedman named Felix, who was also a banker.Alex Butterworth and Ray Laurence, Pompeii: The Living City (New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2005), 75. By 58 AD he was well-established as a successful banker who dealt with a wide variety of Pompeians.Butterworth and Laurence, Pompeii: The Living City, 75 Freedmen and slaves performed many small business tasks for Iucundus, such as signing receipts as witnesses and collecting payments from clients. Many names of elite Pompeian citizens occur frequently in his transaction records, suggesting that Caecilius also had dealings with the upper class of his town. In fact, he even traveled to nearby Nuceria to help the wealthy Praetorian Guard senior centurion Publius Alfenus Varus resell some slaves that he had purchased in an auction.Butterworth and Laurence, Pompeii: The Living City, 77. He had at least two sons, Sextus Caecilius Iucundus Metellus (after his wife) and Quintus Caecilius Iucundus. Caecilius departed from the traditional naming system, giving each of his sons a name that implied a relationship with the illustrious family of the Caecilii Metelli.August Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, trans. Francis W. Kelsey (New York: The Macmillan Company, 2nd ed. 1902), p.507. The tablets that Caecilius left behind suggest that he died in the earthquake on 5 February 62, since his records stop a few days before that date.Butterworth and Laurence, Pompeii: The Living City, 159.  Banking in Pompeii  Caecilius was a type of banker called an argentarius, which meant that he acted as a middleman in auctions. The Pompeian argentarius would pay the vendor for the purchased item and then grant the buyer a time frame in which to repay him. According to the records of Caecilius, mostly dating from the 50s, the buyers had between a few months and a year to repay the loan to the argentarius.The Cambridge Ancient History, 2nd ed. (London: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 772. The argentarius would receive interest on the loan, as well as a commission known as a merces.The Cambridge Ancient History, 773. Some argentarii, called coactores argentarii, collected debt money in addition to making arrangements in the auctions, while other argentarii were assisted by coactores who collected the debts for them. It is uncertain whether Caecilius was a coactor argentarius or simply an argentarius.  Wax tablets  Caecilius kept many private records of his business transactions on wax tablets, many of which were found in his house in 1875.Jean Andreau, Banking and Business in the Roman World, trans. Janet Lloyd (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 71. Of the 153 tablets discovered, sixteen document contracts between Caecilius and the city of Pompeii; the remaining 137 are receipts from auctions on behalf of third parties.The Cambridge Ancient History, 884. Seventeen of these tablets record loans that he advanced to buyers of auction items.Andreau, Banking and Business in the Roman World, 44. In addition to the transaction information, Caecilius' tablets record the names of vendors and witnesses to the arrangements. The lists of witnesses also give some insight into the social structure of Pompeii, since Caecilius had his witnesses sign in order of social status.The Cambridge Ancient History, 885. The tablets themselves are triptychs, which means that they have three wooden leaves tied together to make six pages.Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, p.499. Wax was put on the inner four pages, and the receipt was written on these surfaces. The tablet was then closed and wrapped with a string, over which the witnesses placed their wax seals. This prevented the document itself from being altered, and there was a brief description of the receipt written on the outside for identification purposes.Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, p.500. To read about the tablets in greater detail and to view pictures of reconstructed tablets, see pp. 499-501. On-line version only has text, not images.  Inscription from a tablet  The following is the translation of a 56 AD receipt for the proceeds of an auction sale. In this inscription, Caecilius was very exact in the details. He included the date and the list of witnesses, which were listed in descending order of social status. So by examining several of his tablets, it is possible to determine the relative social standings of clients with whom Caecilius arranged numerous transactions.  House  Part of Caecilius' house still stands on Stabiae Street in Pompeii today,Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, p.352. and it provides many interesting pieces of information both about Caecilius and Pompeii. Archaeologists discovered the wax tablets there, and the Lararium, or shrine, in his house features a relief depicting the Temple of Jupiter during the 62 AD earthquake.Paul Zanker, Pompeii: Public and Private Life, trans. Deborah Lucas Schneider (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998), 106. The atrium was once decorated with paintings. The floor is decorated with a black and white mosaic and at the entrance a reclining dog is depicted. Several graffiti messages have been found on the walls of the house, including one that reads \\"May those who love prosper; let them perish who cannot love; let them perish twice over who veto love.\\"Butterworth and Laurence, Pompeii: The Living City, 134. The tablinum, or study, in Caecilius' house contains some beautiful wall paintings, and an amphora given by one of his sons to the other was also found in the house.  Depictions in fiction  Book One of the Cambridge Latin Course is a fictional account of the life of Iucundus, who is referred to as Caecilius in the series.http://www.cambridgescp.com/Upage.php?p=clc%5Eoa_book1%5Estage1 In the book he has a wife, Metella, whose name means \\"little basket of stones\\", and a son, Quintus, on whom books two and three in the series are based. He also has two slaves; a gardener named Clemens, and a cook named Grumio. It is also revealed that Caecilius once had another slave, Felix. However, after he saved Quintus from a kidnapping attempt, the banker released him. In the book, Caecilius dies in the 79 AD eruption of Vesuvius. However, as stated earlier, it is now believed that he actually perished in the 62 AD earthquake that preceded the eruption, since the records of his negotiated contracts cease shortly before then. Caecilius, along with his banking profession, also has a minor role in Robert Harris's 2003 novel Pompeii. In a 2008 episode of television science-fiction series Doctor Who entitled \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\", Peter Capaldi portrays Lobus Caecilius, a marble merchant based on Caecilius. In this story, he and his family are saved from the eruption by the Doctor, who transports them to safety.

Ivan Bilibin gained popularity with his illustrations to Russian folk tales and Slavic folklore. His work was throughout his career inspired by the art and culture of Old Russia. Biography Ivan Bilibin was born in Tarkhovka, a suburb of St. Petersburg. He studied in 1898 at Anton A≈æbe Art School in Munich, where he was heavily influenced by Art Nouveau and the German satirical journal Simplicissimus,Jose Alainz, Komiks: Comic Art in Russia, 2010, p.26 and then under Ilya Repin in St. Petersburg.Janina Orlov, 'Ivan Bilibin' in Donald Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: A-F, p.121 After graduating in May 1901 he went to Munich, where he completed his training with the painter Anton A≈æbe. In the period 1902 to 1904, working under the Russian Museum (Museum of His Imperial Majesty Alexander III) he traveled to the Vologda, Olonetsk and Arkhangelsk Governorates, performing ethnographic research, and examining examples of Russian wooden architecture. He published his findings in the monograph –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–µ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–∞ (Folk Arts of the Russian North) in 1904. Old Russian art had a great influence on his works. Another influence on his art was traditional Japanese prints and Renaissance woodcuts.Maria Peitcheva, Ivan Bilibin: Drawings Colour Plates, 2016, p.1 After the formation of the artists' association Mir Iskusstva, where he was an active member, his entry into the newspaper and book graphics scene began with a commission for the design of magazine Mir Iskusstva in 1899, later contributing essays on Russian folk art.Richard Taruskin, 'From Subject to Style: Stravinsky and the Painters' in Jann Pasler, Confronting Stravinsky: Man, Musician, and Modernist, 1986, p.26 Artistic design of other magazines such as Dog Rose (–®–∏–ø–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫) and productions of a Moscow publishing house followed. Bilibin gained renown in 1899, when he released his illustrations of Russian fairy tales. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he drew revolutionary cartoons, especially for the magazine Zhupel (–ñ—É–ø–µ–ª—ä), which in 1906 became prohibited because of his illustration depicting the emperor as a donkey. He served as the designer for the 1909 premi√®re production of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's The Golden Cockerel. In 1911, Bilibin was hired by the State Paper Manufacturing Section to illustrate ball programs, exhibition and book posters, postcards for the Red Cross's Society of St. Eugenia, and envelopes and stationery with the Russian Bogatyrs.Elena Litovchenko, 'Late Nineteenth Century Cover Designs from the Collection of the Research Museum of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts' in Alla Rosenfeld, Defining Russian Graphic Arts: From Diaghilev to Stalin, 1898-1934, p47-48 After the October Revolution in 1917, Bilibin left Russia when the revolution proved alien to him. Hungry for a new exotic environment, in 1920 Bilibin went to stay in Egypt. He moved to Cairo and Alexandria where he painted for the Greek colony. In Cairo he specialized in the Byzantine-style art that was in demand by the Greek colony for icons and frescoes. He was also enraptured by the architecture of mosques and their \\"head-spinning ornamentation\\". Bilibin then settled in Paris in 1925, where he took to decorating private mansions and Orthodox churches. He still longed for his homeland, and, after decorating the Soviet Embassy, he returned in 1936 to Soviet Russia. Bilibin died during the Siege of Leningrad, starving within the city when he refused to leave, and was buried in a collective grave.

Geography The ecoregion includes the lowland forests extending from the Gulf of Guinea a few hundred kilometers inland, from western C√¥te d'Ivoire to the western shore of Lake Volta in Ghana. A few enclaves lie further east and inland in the Togo Mountains of Togo, eastern Ghana, and Benin. The Sassandra River of C√¥te d'Ivoire separates the Eastern Guinean forests from the Western Guinean forests which lie to the west. Inland and to the east, the Eastern Guinean forests transition to the Guinean forest- savanna mosaic.Burgess, Neil, Jennifer D‚ÄôAmico Hales, Emma Underwood (2004). Terrestrial Ecoregions of Africa and Madagascar: A Conservation Assessment. Island Press, Washington DC. Cities in the ecoregion include Abidjan and Yamoussoukro in Ivory Coast and Kumasi in Ghana. The Eastern Guinean forests, together with the other tropical moist broadleaf forests of West Africa, is included within Conservation International's Guinean Forests of West Africa biodiversity hotspot. Climate The climate is tropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons. Average annual rainfall ranges from 2500 mm in the west, declining as one moves inland to 1500 mm along the northern edge and in the mountains of Togo and Benin. Flora Tropical moist forest is the predominant vegetation type. Moist evergreen forest is found in the west and along the coast, transitioning to moist semi-evergreen forest further inland, and dry semi-evergreen forest in the north. Characteristic trees of the moist evergreen forest are Entandrophragma utile, Khaya ivorensis, and Triplochiton scleroxylon. Dominant trees in the moist semi-evergreen forests are Celtis spp., Mansonia altissima, Pterygota macrocarpa, Nesogordonia papaverifera, Sterculia rhinopetala, and Milicia excelsa. Trees of the Togo Mountains forests include Milicia excelsa, Triplochiton scleroxylon, Antiaris toxicaria africana, Diospyros mespiliformis, Afzelia africana, and Ceiba pentandra. Fauna Four mammals are endemic to the ecoregion ‚Äì Wimmer's shrew (Crocidura wimmeri), Ivory Coast rat (Dephomys eburneae), Cansdale's swamp rat (Malacomys cansdalei), and Togo mouse (Leimacomys buettneri).

It carries traffic under Boston Harbor in one direction, from Logan International Airport and Route 1A in East Boston. The tunnel originally deposited traffic at the west side of the North End, but with the completion of the Big Dig, it was modified to have two exits. One travels under I-93 and emerges on the west side of I-93 near Haymarket Subway Station. The other exit routes traffic to I-93 northbound and Storrow Drive. Traffic headed for I-93 southbound and the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) westbound is normally routed to the Ted Williams Tunnel. History The Sumner Tunnel was opened on June 30, 1934. It carried traffic in both directions until the opening of the parallel Callahan Tunnel in 1961. The Sumner Tunnel is named for William H. Sumner, the son of Governor Increase Sumner. , a toll of $1.50 is charged for non-commercial two-axle vehicles with a Massachusetts E-ZPass, while non-Massachusetts E-ZPass holders are charged $1.75. Vehicles without E-ZPass are charged $2.05 through MassDOT's Pay by Plate MA program. For residents of certain Boston ZIP Codes, a discount is in effect using an E-ZPass transponder, costing $0.20. On November 14, 2008, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority voted in favor of a proposed toll hike which would double the toll to $7.00 for non-commercial vehicles (at the time, the toll was $3.50 in the southbound direction only). E-ZPass users would receive a $1.00 discount and commercial vehicles would end up having to pay $9.00. This vote was later rescinded following a vote approving a 1.25% sales tax increase. In 2016, cashless tolling systems were installed in both directions, entering the Sumner Tunnel and exiting the Callahan Tunnel as part of a plan to modernize toll collection in the Boston area.

Johnson, and was the first African- American secretary in the White House. Johnson was famous for working long hours and insisting his assistants worked long hours as well. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson became president, he requested a new slate of secretaries. He saw Whittington working in a government office, and requested that his assistant Jack Valenti get her home phone number. Johnson called her unannounced one evening, and requested that she come in that night for an interview. According to audiotapes of Johnson's phone calls, Whittington at first thought the call was a joke, but came to believe that it really was the president on the line.Jon Margolis, The Last Innocent Year: America in 1964: The Beginning of the \\"Sixties\\"; New York: William Morrow & Co., 1999; p. 60. > Gerri? Where are you?\\" > \\"I'm at home. Who's this?\\" > \\"This is the president.\\" > \\"Oh, I think someone's playing with me. She applied for the job and was offered the position. Having a black woman in the White House was very unusual in the early 1960s. Johnson wanted to advertise the fact that he had hired a black woman, but chose not to call a news conference. Instead, he arranged for Whittington to appear on the television game show \\"What's My Line?\\", wherein contestants attempted to guess her profession. This may have seemed less overt, but probably exposed her to more viewers than if a standard press conference had been held. Whittington appeared on episode #696 of the game show What's My Line? on January 19, 1964. She was the first contestant. The mystery guest that evening was Van Heflin and the panel consisted of Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, Dorothy Kilgallen, and Bennett Cerf. After Whittington signed the blackboard as \\"Jerri Whittington,\\" she told host John Daly that she was from West River, Maryland. Whittington's occupation was shown on the screen as \\"Secretary to President Johnson.\\" After her game, she described President Lyndon Johnson with the following words, \\"great warmth, fair, kind, a perfectionist.\\" Later Whittington appeared in several magazines, including Jet and Sepia. She was the first person to learn that Justice Thurgood Marshall had been nominated by President Johnson to the Supreme Court. Minutes before LBJ made the official announcement, he took his nominee down to her office and said, \\"Here's the next Supreme Court Justice!\\" She told friends that she thanked the President for making the choice of the first Black court justice. After suffering a stroke at age 61, Ms. Whittington died of cancer in Washington, DC, on January 24, 1993, on the same day as Justice Thurgood Marshall.

Under the guise of pastoral characters, it is an examination of love and contains many allusions to contemporary literary figures. It enjoyed a modest success, but was not soon reprinted; its promised sequel was never published, and presumably never written. Plot The main characters of the Galatea are Elicio and Erastro, best friends and both in love with Galatea. The novel opens with her and her best friend, Florisa, bathing, talking of love. Erastro and Elicio reveal to each other their desire for Galatea, but agree not to let it come between their friendship. Eventually, all four of them begin their journey to the wedding of Daranio and Silveria, along which, in the pastoral tradition, they encounter other characters who tell their own stories and often join the traveling group. The vast majority of the characters in the book are involved primarily in minor story lines. Lisandro loses his love, Leonida, when Crisalvo mistakenly kills her instead of his former love Silvia. Lisandro avenges Leonida's death in the presence of the main party. Astor, under the pseudonym Silerio, feigns attraction for N√≠sida‚Äôs sister Blanca in order to avoid the scorn of N√≠sida‚Äôs lover Timbrio, who dies following the confusion present after a successful duel against his rival Pransiles. Astor‚Äôs grief thrusts him into hermitage, waiting to hear from N√≠sida. Arsindo holds a poetry competition betwixt Francenio and Lauso, which is judged by Tirsi and Dam√≥n, lauded by many within the novel as some of the most famous poets of Spain. The competition is determined to have no single winner. The wedding has controversy as Mireno is deeply in love with Silveria, yet Daranio‚Äôs wealth guaranteed him the hand of Silveria. These stories sometimes have characters that cross over, resulting in the sub-plots being intertwined at times. For example, Teolinda, whose sister Leonida played in an integral role in separating Teolinda from her lover Artidoro, finds Leonida much later with a group of soldiers. The fame of Tirsi and Dam√≥n instantly connects them with the hired wedding bards, Orompo, Crisio, Marsilio, and Orfenio, as well as the teacher Arsindo. Analysis La Galatea is an imitation of the Diana of Jorge de Montemayor, and shows an even greater resemblance to Gaspar Gil Polo's continuation of the Diana. Next to Don Quixote and the Novelas exemplares, his pastoral romance is considered particularly notable because it predicts the poetic direction in which Cervantes would go for the rest of his career. It possesses little originality, but is highly reminiscent of its models, and particularly of the Diana of Gil Polo. In composing this pastoral romance, Cervantes seems to have intended to use the tale merely as an excuse for a rich collection of poems in the old Spanish and Italian styles. The story is merely the thread, which holds the beautiful garland together; the poems are the portion most deserving of attention. They are many and various, and uphold Cervantes' claim to rank among the most eminent poets, whether in reference to verse or to prose. Should his originality in versified composition be called in question, a close study of Galatea must banish all doubt. Contemporaries of Cervantes claimed that he was incapable of writing poetry, and that he could compose only beautiful prose; but that observation referred solely to his dramatic works. Every critic sufficiently acquainted with his lyrical compositions has rendered justice to their merit. From the romance of Galatea, Cervantes must have composed in all the various kinds of syllabic measure used in his time. He even occasionally adopted the old dactylic stanza. He appears to have experienced some difficulty in the metrical form of the sonnet, but his poems in Italian octaves display great facility. Among these, the song of Caliope, in the last book of the Galatea, stands out. In the same manner as Gil Polo in his Diana, he makes the river Turia pronounce the praises of the celebrated Valencians. The poetic fancy of Cervantes summons the muse Calliope before the shepherds and shepherdesses, to render solemn homage to those contemporaries whom he esteems worthy of distinction as poets. The most beautiful poems in the Galatea are a few in the cancion style, some of which are iambics, and some in trochaic or Old Spanish verse. Cervantes has here and there indulged in those antiquated and fantastic plays of wit, which at a subsequent period he himself ridiculed. Themes ;Upbringings and life- styles :One of the primary treatments in the Galatea, and most evident in the contrast between Elicio and Erastro, is the perception of rural and city folk and their lives. Elicio, a cultured shepherd, and Erastro, a r√∫stico ganadero (rustic herdsman) are an odd pair of friends, and throughout the novel their differing views come out in conversations with other characters. Erastro, though from the rural parts of Spain, is very eloquent in speech‚Äîa trait that surprises many. However, because of his background, Erastro feels disadvantaged in his desire for Galatea, who had a very cultured upbringing similar to Elicio‚Äôs. A similar discussion ensues when a group of soldiers meets the group and one of them, Darinto, describes his view of pastoral (or rural) life as being a simple one, without all the complications, formalities and expenses of city life. Dam√≥n replies that the rural life is not as glorious or desirable as Darinto imagines: there are just as many chores and other things to do in country life as in city life, and so is not the relaxing simple life described. ;Friendship ;Love, affection, and desire Second Part The original title published with the work now simply known as the Galatea was La primera parte de la Galatea (The First Part of the Galatea). Cervantes indicated on numerous occasions during his life he planned to publish a second part, even in the ending of the first part: El fin deste amoroso cuento y historia [...] con otras cosas sucedidas a los pastores hasta aqu√≠ nombrados, en la segunda parte desta historia se prometen, la cual, si con apacibles voluntades esta primera viene rescibida, tendr√° atrevimiento a salir con brevedad a ser vista de los ojos y entendimiento de las gentes (The end of this amorous story and tale [...] with other things which occurred to the shepherds named up to this point here, are promised for the second part of this story, which, if this first one is received with a good disposition, will dare to appear soon, to be observed by the eyes and understanding of the people.) In Cervantes' later novel, Don Quixote, La Galatea appears in the book burning scene. Its worth is measured as satisfactory in itself, but both the Barber and Curate agree the plot matters little without a Second Part. The Galatea enjoyed moderate success, but any work that Cervantes may have begun on a conclusion was lost to history following his death. In other media The book is used in the Starz series, Black Sails. In the third episode of the second season, Captain Flint leaves a copy of La Galatea at the doorstep of his close friend, Miranda Barlow. References * Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. La Galatea. Ed.

Dating from 1664, it is on King Street, between Welsh Back and Queen Charlotte Street, near the old city centre docks. Named by a sailor who owned the pub after Llandogo in Wales which built trows (flat-bottomed river boats), the building was damaged in World War II, but remained in sufficiently good condition to be designated Grade II* listed building status in 1959. The pub is said to have inspired Robert Louis Stevenson to write of the Admiral Benbow Inn in Treasure Island and Daniel Defoe supposedly met Alexander Selkirk there, his inspiration for Robinson Crusoe. The pub is also supposedly haunted, with up to 15 ghosts, the best known being a small child whose footsteps can be heard on the top floor. On 20 April 2019 the pub was closed, and its future is currently unknown. History The Llandoger Trow in the early 1930s before part was bombed in World War II The building dates from 1664, originally a row of three houses. It was built on a timber box frame, with brick stacks. The pub has an 18th-century shop front, but the main door dates from the 20th century. The pub was partially destroyed by a bomb in World War II, but three of the original five projecting gables remain. It was designated a Grade II* listed building on 8 January 1959. Tradition has it that Daniel Defoe met Alexander Selkirk, his inspiration for Robinson Crusoe, here,Bristol Tourist Information History & Heritage and it was Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs inspiration for the Admiral Benbow in Treasure Island. In the Victorian era the pub was associated with the Theatre Royal, which is across the road, and was visited by many performers and musicians including Henry Irving. Name A trow was a flat-bottomed barge, and Llandogo is a village north-west of Bristol, across the Severn Estuary and upstream on the River Wye in South Wales, where trows were once built. Trows historically sailed to trade in Bristol from Llandogo. The pub was named by Captain Hawkins, a sailor who lived in Llandogo and ran the pub. Modern usage In 1962 it became a Berni Inn, but now belongs to Whitbread and traded as a Brewers Fayre. In 2007, The Llandoger Trow was one of the three locations seen in the \\"Pirate's Cove\\" episode of Most Haunted Live! The others were Blackbeard's houses and Redcliffe Caves. The most popular ghost story associated with the pub is that of a small child who wore leg braces and haunts the top floor, their footsteps heard at night. The programme claimed that there were at least 15 ghosts at the Llandoger Trow, and since 2009 the owners have organised ghost hunts overnight. In 2019 Whitbread decided to close the Llandoger Trow as it did not fit Whitbread's style of pubs, and it needed repairs at an estimated cost exceeding ¬£2 million. It closed on 20 April 2019. Whitbread intend to lease out the building as a going concern.

It developed a reputation for intra-republican and sectarian violence and criminality, before being forcibly disbanded by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1992. Some of the IPLO's most notable attacks during its short existence (compared to other paramilitary groups in Ireland during The Troubles) were: *the Orange Cross shooting in which IPLO gunmen killed a member of the Red Hand Commando and injured an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier; * the Donegall Arms shooting when they did a \\"spray job\\" (spraying the pub with bullets indiscriminately) on a Protestant-owned pub, killing two Protestant civilians and injuring four others; and * the assassination of outspoken Loyalist and alleged UVF member George Seawright in November 1987. On 1 May 1990 the IPLO became a Proscribed Organization by the British government.https://api.parliament.uk/historic- hansard/lords/1990/may/01/northern-ireland-emergency-provisions Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (Amendment) Order 1990: HL Deb 01 May 1990 vol 518 cc976-9 The IPLO remains a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. Foundation The IPLO emerged from a split within the INLA. After the 1981 Irish hunger strike, in which three of its members died, the INLA began to break apart. The INLA virtually dissolved as a coherent force in the mid-1980's. Factions associated with Belfast and Dublin fell into dispute with each other. When INLA man Harry Kirkpatrick turned supergrass, he implicated many of his former comrades in various activities and many of them were convicted on his testimony. Members both inside and out of prison broke away from the INLA and set up the IPLO. Some key players at the outset were Tom McAllister, Gerard Steenson, Jimmy Brown and Martin \\"Rook\\" O'Prey. Jimmy Brown formed a minor political group, known as the Republican Socialist Collective, which was to act as the political wing of the IPLO. The IPLO's initial priority was to forcibly disband the Irish Republican Socialist Movement from which it had split, and most of its early attacks reflected this, being more frequently against former comrades than on the security forces. The feud with the INLA lasted from 1986 to 1987 and resulted in the deaths of 12 people including IPLO leader Gerard Steenson who was shot in March 1987. Internal feud The IPLO was accused of becoming involved in the illegal drug trade, especially in ecstasy. Some of its Belfast members were also accused of the prolonged gang rape of a North Down woman in Divis Flats in 1990.Ballymurphy and the Irish War by De Baroid p. 331 Many of its recruits had fallen out of favour with the IRA and the portents for its future were not good. Sammy Ward, a low-level IPLO member, broke away from the main body of the organisation with a few supporters when the IPLO were severely depleted and weak in Belfast. His faction attacked the rest of the IPLO, culminating in the killing of Jimmy Brown. A full-scale feud followed between two factions terming themselves \\"Army Council\\" (led by Jimmy Brown) and \\"Belfast Brigade\\" (led by Ward), which led to the 3000th killing of the Troubles, Hugh McKibben, a 21-year-old \\"Army Council\\" man. Brown had been the previous victim when he was shot dead in West Belfast on 18 August 1992.INLA ‚Äì Deadly Divisions by Holland and McDonald, Torc (1994), p. 334 This feud was described by the IPLO's critics as a lethal squabble over money and drugs. Disbandment The Provisional IRA ‚Äì by far the largest armed republican group in Ireland ‚Äì decided this was an opportunity to attack and remove the IPLO given the IPLO's involvement in the drug trade. They mounted an operation to wipe out the IPLO. On Saturday 31 October 1992, in an event that was later dubbed \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" by locals in Belfast,INLA Deadly Divisions Jack Holland p. 342 the IRA attacked the two IPLO factions in Belfast, killing the breakaway Belfast Brigade leader Sammy Ward in Short Strand.INLA Deadly Divisions Jack Holland p. 341 There were also raids on pubs and clubs where IPLO members were kneecapped. On 2 November 1992 the second-in-command of the IPLO Belfast Brigade formally surrendered to the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade adjutant, which brought an end to the group in Belfast.INLA Deadly Divisions Jack Holland p. 343 Outside Belfast the IRA did not attack any IPLO units and issued statements absolving the IPLO units in Derry, Newry and Armagh from any involvement in the drugs trade that was alleged against those in Belfast. In Dublin the IRA reprieved the IPLO Chief of Staff in return for surrendering a small cache of arms held in Ballybough. Casualties According to the Sutton database of deaths at the University of Ulster's CAIN project, the IPLO was responsible for 22 killings during the Troubles.

It was established by brothers Frank and Aldo Berni, who modelled the chain on restaurants they had seen in America. The restaurants introduced the postwar British public to its own home-grown restaurant chain, which came with its own pre-stylised restaurants with Tudor-looking false oak beams and white walls. By 1970 the chain comprised 147 hotels and restaurants, including the New Inn at Gloucester, the Mitre at Oxford, and several in Japan. It was the largest food chain outside the USA. History Brothers Aldo and Frank Berni, alongside their partner Paul Rosse, opened the first Berni Inn on 27 July 1956 at The Rummer, a historic pub in central Bristol. More outlets were opened, and the company went public in 1962. The chain offered slick service and value for money, achieved partly by offering only a limited meat-based menu and a relatively small wine list. It had a loyal and regular following and quickly expanded through the 1960s, first throughout Bristol, and then through much of the rest of the country. Unlike other restaurants, Berni Inns did not do their own butchery but bought in quality steaks already prepared. Behind the scenes, staff training manuals showed that they expected high standards from their employees. Their brother Marco managed Harvey's Restaurant in Bristol in the 1960s. The first female manager within the Berni Inn franchise was Gerda Thut, who took over The Sawyer's Arms in Nottingham in the 1960s. This was noted as a progressive step in management and equality at the time. The chain was sold to Grand Metropolitan for ¬£14.5m in 1970. Berni Inn was sold to Whitbread in 1995, who converted the outlets into their own Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurants. Aldo Berni died in 1997 at the age of 88. Frank died 10 July 2000, aged 96. Fare A typical dinner at the Berni Inn: * Starter: melon boat with maraschino cherry, or prawn cocktail * Main course: steak, gammon steak or plaice with chips and peas * Dessert: Black Forest gateau or a choice from the cheese board (Danish Blue, Stilton or Cheddar) * Irish coffee and After Eight mints The most frequently ordered meal, even as late as the 1980s, was prawn cocktail, steak and Black Forest gateau. This is sometimes called the Great British Meal. As Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham note in their 1997 book The Prawn Cocktail Years, \\"cooked as it should be, this much derided and often ridiculed dinner is still something very special indeed\\". In popular culture In the Red Dwarf episode \\"Better Than Life\\", Holly notes that even though loneliness weighs heavily on us all, \\"Personally, the only thing that keeps me going is the thought that we are over 60 billion miles away from the nearest Berni Inn.\\" The restaurants were also mentioned in the Only Fools and Horses episodes \\"Yesterday Never Comes\\", where Del takes his date there, \\"Go West Young Man\\" and \\"Fatal Extraction\\". There is a scene, with an accompanying song lyrics in the made-for-TV film That Day We Sang by Victoria Wood, first aired on Boxing Day 2014, depicting a Berni Inn in 1969. In the novel Clever Girl, by Tessa Hadley, the narrator writes that when she was a child in the early 1960s, her mother took her to a Berni Inn for dinner to celebrate the mother's birthday; however, this \\"was a waste\\" as \\"overawed and stubborn, I wouldn't eat a thing.\\" There is a scene set in a Berni Inn in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham and the 2014 musical which is based on it. Berni Inn is mentioned by fictional chat show host Alan Partridge in an episode of his radio show Knowing Me, Knowing You. While interviewing a fictional French Michelin Star chef, Partridge speculates on a collaboration between Berni Inn and Peter Ustinov called \\"Pete and Berni's Philosophical Steakhouse,\\" apparently mistaking the surname \\"Berni\\" for a first name. The joke was repeated when the radio show converted to television and became the hit TV series Knowing Me, Knowing You. Alan Partridge also asked the chef on his chat show if he was jealous that he had only one restaurant and Berni Inn had thousands. In the an episode of Harry Enfield and Chums, Tim Nice-But-Dim is asked what he did after he left school and replies that he was picked up by his parents and taken to Berni Inn.

The Long Walls ran nearly due north, so that the wall on the right hand was called the eastern, and the one on the left hand the western or Sicyonian. The space between them must have been considerable; since there was sufficient space for an army to be drawn up for battle. Indeed, the area was the scene of battles between Sparta and Athens in 391 BCE, leaving Spartans in command of Lechaeum, which they garrisoned with their troops (see Battle of Lechaeum). The flat country between Corinth and Lechaeum is composed only of the sand washed up by the sea; and the port must have been originally artificial,œáœâœÉœÑ·Ω∏œÇ ŒªŒØŒºŒ∑ŒΩ, Dionys. though it was no doubt rendered both spacious and convenient by the wealthy Corinthians.

John James Randolf Adolphus Mills (June 23, 1923 ‚Äì July 9, 2016), known as Johnny Barnes, was a Bermudian native found waving to passing traffic at the Foot of the Lane roundabout in Hamilton, Bermuda, from roughly 3:45 am to 10 am, every workday, rain or shine. A Bermuda institution mentioned him in several guidebooks and profiled him in 2 documentary films; he was known for waving and saying \\"I love you, God loves you,\\" to passing commuters during the morning rush hour into Hamilton. Due to the unique layout of the island and its roads, nearly all drivers at rush hour coming from the western and southern areas of the island passed Barnes at the roundabout. Life Barnes, born to parents from St. Kitts, was an electrician by trade and worked on the Bermuda Railroad as an electrician until the railroad closed in 1948. He then became a bus driver. Barnes was fond of waving to people while driving the bus, and would occasionally sit and wave to people on his breaks or when coming to work. Barnes was married in 1949 and lived with his wife until his death on July 9, 2016. His wife had a cheery disposition because he (Johnny) had \\"covered her with honey\\" since they were married. They had no children.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/johnny-barnes-8pj2g9msg One day in approximately 1986, Barnes stopped at the Crow Lane roundabout and took up waving to traffic. He was there almost every day, until his \\"retirement\\" in December 2015. Local radio stations report receiving frantic calls when Barnes was not at his unofficial post. He was occasionally joined by people, sometimes costumed, waving signs to promote a charity, event, or business. Attitudes and beliefs Barnes credits his mother for teaching him goodwill and kindness to strangers, including 'speaking to everyone you see, because you never know when you might need them', and punishing him for not talking to a lady he saw.https://vimeo.com/101236267 Barnes has said, \\"I enjoy making people happy,...I like to let them know that life is sweet, that it‚Äôs good to be alive.\\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/johnny-barnes-8pj2g9msg In the 2011 documentary Mr Happy Man, he says \\"Life is sweet, life is beautiful, it is sweet to be alive. Enjoy the sunshine, the flowers, the birds - they're happy.\\" In the 2011 short-subject documentary Mr. Happy Man, Barnes identified himself as a religious man, a Seventh-Day Adventist who was motivated to share God's love for everyone. Though Barnes would pray with visitors to his post if requested, he was not known as a religious proselytizer. Barnes said ‚ÄúWe human beings got to learn how to love one another...

The statue is located on Crow Lane just up from the roundabout. Although there were objections to spending $70,000 to build a statue to a man still living, Barnes said in Mr. Happy Man that he appreciated the gesture while he was still alive, saying he would not be able to enjoy it if he were dead. In early June 2016, Dennis Bean took up Johnny's position at the roundabout at the bottom of Trimingham Road, waving to traffic in the same manner made famous by Johnny Barnes.

A Tortolian from the British Virgin Islands, he was the second black man to be awarded the Victoria Cross after William Hall.The Soldier's Burden ‚Äì Gambia 1866 Details Samuel Hodge was one of those West Indian soldiers who garrisoned British positions on the West coast of Africa during the 19th century. White troops suffered terribly from malaria, blackwater fever and dysentery, and the War Office addressed the problem by shipping in troops of the West India Regiments. In 1866, Lieutenant Colonel George Abbas Kooli D'Arcy, commanding officer of the 3rd West India Regiment and Governor of The Gambia, marched to confront a rebellious Marabout leader named Amar Faal at Tubabecolong (also known as Tubab Kolon), a stockaded town on the northern bank of the River Gambia; taking with him 270 officers and men of the 4th West India Regiment from the Bathurst garrison, Hodge being one; around 500 warriors from the Soninke people later joined his force. He attacked the town on 30 June. Private Hodge was about 26 years old (his precise date of birth is not known). The British force had light armaments and rockets, but failed to break through the wooden stockade by bombardment. D'Arcy called for volunteers to assist him in trying to cut a breach by hand. Two officers and fifteen men (including Hodge) seized axes and followed him. However, the fire of the defenders was intense; those officers were killed almost immediately, and most of the remaining men were wounded. D'Arcy and the two uninjured men, Hodge and another soldier (Private Boswell), reached the stockade, and hacked a gap in it large enough for a man. Boswell was killed, leaving only D'Arcy and Hodge of the original assault party of eighteen. D'Arcy went through the gapfollowed closely by Hodge, who used his axe to hack open the inside fastenings on two more gates before being shot down. Hodge sustained serious gunshot wounds, but survived. British troops poured in through the now open gates; and in the fierce fighting that followed, several hundred of the Marabouts were killed, and the village and stockade burned down.

When it became clear that the populace did not support them, the committee was dissolved and the Presbyterians fled. 1659 There were two committees of safety in 1659. The first was set up on 7 May, on the authority of the Rump Parliament, to replace the Lord Protector Richard Cromwell's Council of State. It initially had seven members Charles Fleetwood, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, Sir Henry Vane the Younger, Edmund Ludlow, William Sydenham, Richard Salwey, and John Jones.

It is named from its appearance under a microscope. The disease is characterized by skin abnormalities that begin in childhood, usually a blistering rash which heals, followed by the development of harder skin growths. The skin may develop grey or brown patches which fade with time. Other symptoms can include hair loss, dental abnormalities, eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss and lined or pitted fingernails and toenails. Associated problems can include delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures and other neurological problems. Most males with the disease do not survive to childbirth. Incontinentia pigmenti is caused by a mutation in the IKBKG gene, which encodes the NEMO protein, which serves to protect cells against TNF-alpha- induced apoptosis. A lack of IKBKG therefore makes cells more prone to apoptosis. There is no specific treatment; individual conditions must be managed by specialists. Presentation Incontinentia pigmenti forming along thumb The skin lesions evolve through characteristic stages: # blistering (from birth to about four months of age), # a wart-like rash (for several months), # swirling macular hyperpigmentation (from about six months of age into adulthood), followed by # linear hypopigmentation. Alopecia, dental anomalies, and dystrophic nails are observed. Some patients have retinal vascular abnormalities predisposing to retinal detachment in early childhood. Cognitive delays or intellectual disability are occasionally seen. The discolored skin is caused by excessive deposits of melanin (normal skin pigment). Most newborns with IP will develop discolored skin within the first two weeks. The pigmentation involves the trunk and extremities, is slate-grey, blue or brown, and is distributed in irregular marbled or wavy lines. The discoloration sometimes fades with age. Neurological problems can include cerebral atrophy, the formation of small cavities in the central white matter of the brain, and the loss of neurons in the cerebellar cortex. About 20% of children with IP will have slow motor development, muscle weakness in one or both sides of the body, intellectual disability, and seizures. They are also likely to have visual problems, which can include: crossed eyes, cataracts, retinal detachment, and severe visual loss. Dental problems are also common, and can include hypodontia, abnormally shaped teeth, and delayed tooth eruption. Breast anomalies can occur in 1% of patients and can include hypoplasia or supernumerary nipples. Skeletal and structural anomalies can occur in approximately 14% of patients, including: * Somatic asymmetry * Hemivertebrae * Scoliosis * Spina bifida * Syndactyly * Acheiria (congenital absence of the hands - note: other limbs may be affected) * Ear anomalies * Extra ribs * Skull deformities Genetics IP is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. IP is lethal in most, but not all, males. A female with IP may have inherited the IKBKG mutation from either parent or have a new gene mutation. Parents may either be clinically affected or have germline mosaicism. Affected women have a 50% risk of transmitting the mutant IKBKG allele at conception; however, most affected male conceptuses miscarry. Thus, the effective ratio for liveborn children from a mother carrying the mutation is 33% unaffected females, 33% affected females, and 33% unaffected males. Genetic counseling, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis is available. In females, the cells expressing the mutated IKBKG gene due to lyonization selectively die around the time of birth, so the X-inactivation is extremely skewed. IP is caused by mutations in a gene called NEMO (NF-Œ∫B essential modulator). Diagnosis The diagnosis of IP is established by clinical findings and occasionally by corroborative skin biopsy. Molecular genetic testing of the NEMO IKBKG gene (chromosomal locus Xq28) reveals disease-causing mutations in about 80% of probands. Such testing is available clinically.In addition, females with IP have skewed X-chromosome inactivation; testing for this can be used to support the diagnosis.Many people in the past were misdiagnosed with a second type of IP, formerly known as IP1. This has now been given its own name - 'Hypomelanosis of Ito' (incontinentia pigmenti achromians). This has a slightly different presentation: swirls or streaks of hypopigmentation and depigmentation. It is not inherited and does not involve skin stages 1 or 2. Some 33‚Äì50% of patients have multisystem involvement ‚Äî eye, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. Its chromosomal locus is at Xp11, rather than Xq28. Treatment There does not yet exist a specific treatment for IP. Treatment can only address the individual symptoms. History This disorder was first reported by Swiss dermatologist Bruno Bloch in 1926 and American dermatologist Marion Sulzberger in 1928.

He is currently the goalkeeping coach for Chicago Fire FC in Major League Soccer. Career =High School= Born in Pleasant Hill, California, Brown attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California. He started for the 1996 soccer team which is now in the Hall of Fame at De La Salle. The 1996 De La Salle team is the only team in school history to have a perfect record, while letting in no goals in the regular season. Only 3 goals were let in during the playoffs. =College= A highly touted prospect and a starting goalkeeper for the United States in the run-up prior to the 2000 Summer Olympics, Brown played college soccer at the College of William and Mary. In 1999, he became only the third goalkeeper in NCAA history (Tony Meola and Brad Friedel were the other two) to be named NCAA First Team All-American twice. =Professional= The Colorado Rapids then made Brown the third overall pick of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft. Brown's pro career was not as solid as was expected due to various injuries. After sharing goalkeeping duties with David Kramer in his rookie season (an injury which kept him from going to the Olympics), Brown was the principal of the deal that sent Carlos Valderrama from the Tampa Bay Mutiny to Colorado. After only half of one season in Tampa, the Mutiny folded, leaving him exposed in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft. Surprisingly, Brown's high contract kept him from being selected, although he eventually signed with the New England Revolution a few days after the draft. It was in New England that Brown had his best season in 2002; Brown won the starting job from Juergen Sommer midway through the year and led the Revolution to the brink of winning the MLS Cup. Call-ups (but no caps) to the senior national team and a solid 2003 followed, but so did more injuries. After the 2004 season and without a starting job, he signed with Aalesund on a free transfer. On July 2, 2007, Brown made a number of great saves early in the game against Rosenborg, and then he headed in the equalizer at the end of the stoppage time to tie the game 2‚Äì2. It was his first ever goal. In the next few seasons he spent most of his time being injured and was retired from the Aalesund squad after the season of 2009. Brown became a cult figure at Aalesund FK. On February 23, 2010, Brown signed with Portland Timbers in the USSF Division 2 Professional League. He made his first appearance for the team on September 25, 2010, in Portland's penultimate game of the 2010 season, as a late replacement for an injured Matt Pyzdrowski in a game against Crystal Palace Baltimore. Brown signed with the new Major League Soccer expansion team Portland Timbers on January 18, 2011http://timbers.theoffside.com/mls/adin- brown-signed-by-timbers.html . Following the 2011 season, the Timbers announced that they had declined a second year option on Brown's contract and he would not be brought back for the 2012 season. Brown entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft but was not selected and became a free agent. On March 12, 2012, the Timbers announced that Brown would be one of the team's Alumni Ambassadors, making public appearances for the team and assisting with the team's youth efforts and clinics.

In 1996, Dix co-founded the October 22nd Coalition to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. Dix along with Cornel West was a central figure in the campaign to Stop \\"Stop and Frisk\\" aimed at opposing the New York City stop-and-frisk program to stop hundreds of thousands of people in New York City and frisk them. Dix is a member of Refuse Fascism, a coalition group co-initiated by the RCP in 2016 to drive out the Trump administration. Dix was also a member of the Black Workers Congress, the African Liberation Support Committee, and Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Early life Dix grew up in an African- American working class community of West Baltimore, Maryland. While attending college, he was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War. He received orders to report to Fort Bragg Army base in North Carolina. He recalled in an oral history heading onto the base for the first time and seeing a big sign on the side of the road just outside the gate, \\"Welcome to KKK Country\\". He thought to himself \\"what did they get us into here?\\" He was influenced by the black consciousness movement of the times, including Malcolm X's critique of the United States for talking about being for justice while oppressing people in other countries like the Vietnamese, \\"especially when your people are oppressed at home in America.\\" Dix reached a crossroads in December 1969 when during the same month he received orders to report for Vietnam and also heard about the police murder of Fred Hampton in Chicago and the police attach on the Black Panther headquarters in Los Angeles. He thought, \\"this war isn't just something over there, it's here too, and I have to decide what side I'm on. I decided I couldn't be part of the war in Vietnam, I couldn't go fight for America.\\" Refusal, courts-martial and prison The Fort Lewis Six arrested in June 1970 for refusing orders to Vietnam. He was one of six GIs who in June 1970 refused orders to go to Vietnam and who faced courts-martial at that time. This was the largest mass refusal of direct orders to Vietnam during the war and they became known as the Fort Lewis Six. Dix was immediately thrown into the military stockade at the base for pre-trial confinement, an unusual move contrary to military regulations. The local GI underground newspaper, the Lewis-McChord Free Press reported that base \\"regulation 27-2 explicitly states that pre-trial confinement is to be used only when there is danger\\" of self-harm or flight, neither of which applied to Dix. And things went downhill from there according to Dix. In their courts-martial, \\"The military judge made it very clear he wasn't listening. He says, 'You guys can make your arguments for the record, I am not going to consider them, I don't care what you have to say'\\". Dix was imprisoned for two years in Leavenworth Military Penitentiary. He commented at the time, \\"I just have to exist, to be my own man, and accept the consequences. If I had continued to participate in the Army, I wouldn't be able to relate to myself or humanity.\\" It was during his incarceration that he became a revolutionary.\\"Revolutionary Worker Interview: Carl Dix: Days of Resistance. Part 1: The Fort Lewis 6\\", Revolutionary Worker no. 1188, February 23, 2003. One of the first things that happened to him at Leavenworth was a beating by prison guards. As Dix described in a letter to his attorney, \\"Sgt. Davis told me to stand in a yellow square and face the wall, which I did. Specialist Bartlett approached me from the right and questioned me as to why I wasn't standing at the position of parade rest.\\" Dix hadn't received an order to stand at parade rest and said so. This led to what Dix described as an unprovoked assault from both guards during which he \\"was struck in the back several times\\" and thrown \\"to the floor\\". Dix was then charged and sentenced by prison officials with \\"assault on a guard and disobeying an order to stand at parade rest.\\" After his release from Leavenworth, Dix returned to Baltimore and worked and organized at the Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point from 1973 to 1978. Political activities In 2011 Dix played a key role in initiating the \\"Stop Mass Incarceration Network\\" and wrote \\"Taking the Movement of Resistance to Mass Incarceration to a Higher Level Thru Unleashing Determined Mass Resistance\\".Revolution no. 242, August 9, 2011. Dix, together with Cornel West, author and journalist Herb Boyd, Efia Nwangaza of the Malcolm X Center in Greenville, North Carolina, and Rev. Omar Wilkes, issued a statement \\"From Up Against the Wall to Up in Their Faces: STOP ‚Äì \\"STOP & FRISK\\"Revolution no. 246, September 25, 2011. calling for a campaign against at the New York Police Department's \\"Stop and Frisk\\" program. On October 21, 2011, over 30 people, including Dix and West, were arrested at the NYPD's 28th Police Precinct in a mass act of non-violent civil disobedience.\\"Harlem, October 21: An Audacious Start to the Movement to STOP Stop and Frisk\\", Revolution no. 248, October 23, 2011.

They descended from the ancient Banu Taghlib Christian tribe of Mesopotamia and Eastern Arabia. History The Hamdanid dynasty was founded by Hamdan ibn Hamdun. By 892‚Äì893, he was in possession of Mardin, after fighting the Kharidijis of Djazira. In 895 Caliph al-Mutadid invaded, and Hamdan fled Mardin. Hamdan's son Husayn, who was at Ardumusht, joined the caliph's forces. Hamdan later surrendered to the caliph and was imprisoned. In December 908, Husayn conspired to establish Ibn al-Mu'tazz as Caliph. Having failed, Husayn fled until he asked for mediation through his brother Ibrahim. Upon his return he was made governor of Diyar Rabi'a. In 916, Husayn, due to a disagreement with vizier Ali b. Isa, revolted, was captured, imprisoned, and executed in 918. Hamdan's other son, Abdallah, was made governor of Mosul in 905‚Äì906. He conducted campaigns against the Kurds in that region and in 913-914 was dismissed from his post and subsequently revolted. Abdallah submitted himself to Mu'nis, and with his pardon was made governor of Mosul in 914-915. During his brother Husayn's revolt, both he and his brother Ibrahim were temporarily imprisoned. By 919, Abdallah was commanding an army against Yusuf b. Abi l'Sadj, governor of Adharbaydjan and Armenia. The rule of Hassan Nasir al-Dawla (929‚Äì968), governor of Mosul and Diyar Bakr, was sufficiently tyrannical to cause him to be deposed by his own family. His lineage still ruled in Mosul, a heavy defeat by the Buyids in 979 notwithstanding, until 990. After this, their area of control in northern Iraq was divided between the Uqaylids and the Marwanids. Ali Sayf al-Dawla 'Sword of the State' ruled (945‚Äì967) northern Syria from Aleppo, and became the most important opponent of the Christian Byzantine Empire's re-expansion. His court was a centre of culture, thanks to its nurturing of Arabic literature, but it lost this status after the Byzantine conquest of Aleppo. To stop the Byzantine advance, Aleppo was put under the suzerainty of the Fatimids in Egypt, but in 1003 the Fatimids deposed the Hamdanids.

Early life Bloodvessel was born Douglas Woods in the Stoke Newington area of London on 6 September 1958. The son of a single mother, he was adopted by his great-aunt Mary Trendle and her husband Edward, and was legally given their surname. He did not know he was adopted until the age of seven, when he overheard Mary talking to a neighbour and discovered that the woman he knew as \\"Auntie Lily\\" was really his mother. He never met his father. Music career Bloodvessel founded Bad Manners with friends at Woodberry Down Comprehensive School in north London in 1976. Bad Manners were a popular live attraction in North London, with their brand of humorous ska making them comedians of the ska revival scene, with Bloodvessel often wagging his large tongue at his audiences. Bad Manners earned nine Top 40 singles between 1980 and 1983. However, the group originally split up in 1987 after their contract with Portrait Records finished, and Bloodvessel formed a new outfit called Buster's Allstars, performing at clubs and pubs in London. He still played some concerts with Bad Manners at larger venues, along with some new musicians and a few other original band members. In 1988, Bloodvessel licensed the Blue Beat Records name and logo, and ran the record label from an old houseboat in Hackney. Blue Beat issued a number of releases, notably by Bad Manners, Napoleon Solo, Buster's Allstars, and the Billies, but the label folded in 1990. Bloodvessel has appeared in the 1987 films Out of Order and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid before landing a part in an episode of Boon in 1990. In 1998, he signed a solo deal with the Virgin Records offshoot label Innocent Records and recorded an album, but the label decided to axe the project just before his debut solo single was to be released. Personal life Bloodvessel has struggled with morbid obesity and underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery in 2004, with his weight dropping from 31 stone (196.86 kg; 434 lbs) to 13 stone (82.6 kg; 182 lbs).\\"Buster‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpecial Brew‚Äù set to entertain thousands!\\", BBC, 14 March 2006, retrieved 2011-04-13 Bloodvessel once owned a hotel in Margate called Fatty Towers, which specifically catered for larger customers with features such as extra large beds and baths as well as fatty meals.\\"Buster Bloodvessel seriously ill\\", BBC, 1 February 2001, retrieved 2011-04-13 The hotel closed in 1998 and Bloodvessel moved back to London. He often appears as a guest on various television shows, as well as in the tabloid newspapers. He was the main sponsor of football team Margate F.C. in the 1990s. In early 2001, Bloodvessel fell seriously ill during a concert in Perugia, but recovered.

Rosy has been singing since the age of four, when she would lead the youth orchestra of her school until she eventually started singing solo songs. Despite her parents disapproval of a career in singing, Rosy Hohannessian, later Rosy Bedrossian continued on with her passion and eventually, took the stage name Rosy Armen and had success also singing next to established French music stars in France. This success made her a well-known figure not only in France, but also all over Europe, the Soviet Union, United States and the Middle East where there were many Armenian communities and was invited to the imperial coronation as the official singer in October 1967. In 1970, she took part in the selection rounds for representing Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest. She sang the song \\"Gwendolyne\\". Julio Iglesias who was singing the same song during the competition went on to represent Spain with the song. She also partnered with Julio Iglesias. Her repertoire includes music from Aram Khachaturian (composer of the famous \\"Sabre dance\\"), Arno Babadjanian, Michel Legrand. She sing Boris Pasternak and Yevgeny Yevtushenko poems.

In France, she gave concerts in best music theaters including one Olympia in Paris. She also sang at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, at the Los Angeles Music Center, at Place des Arts theater in Montreal, and Luzhniki Palace of Sports in Moscow. After the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, Charles Aznavour invited her to record alongside him and other singers the song \\"Pour toi Arm√©nie\\", a song that remained in 1st place for 10 weeks in a row in the French Top 50. In 1990, she did a tour in Armenia to help the people recovering from the earthquake and to show France's support to Armenians. Already popular in the Armenian diaspora for many decades, Rosy Armen has become very popular in Armenia as well. Since the nineties Rosy Armen performed several live shows in Russia, Armenia, Los Angeles, as well as on many TV and radio shows in France and Armenia. In April 2014, she received the \\"Armenian Music Award\\" as the honor of the Armenian music in the Kremlin in Moscow from the President of Armenians in Moscow, Ara Abramyan.

Ayr, Scotland ‚Äì 29 November 1894 in Aston, Birmingham, England), was the first captain of Aston Villa to lift the FA Cup, in 1887. He was one of Victorian football's first household names.  Life and career  Hunter played at Third Lanark, Ayr Thistle, and Aston Villa, whom he signed for in August 1878, just four years after their formation. His Aston Villa career began 10 years before the commencement of the first Football League season. In his league career (1888‚Äì1890) he played 73 matches scoring 42 goals. Also his 33 goals for Villa in the FA Cup (including 3 in 1888‚Äì1889) remains the Aston Villa record for the competition. Archie Hunter made his League debut on 15 September 1888 at Wellington Road, as a forward, against Stoke. Aston Villa won 5‚Äì1 and Archie Hunter scored one of the goals. He missed 3 League games (out of 22) in 1888‚Äì1889 (he played in all 3 FA Cup ties) and Hunter scored six League goals including two-in-a- League-match once. As a forward he played in a forward-line that scored three- League-goals-or-more-in-a-match on no less than on ten occasions. He scored 10 goals in 1888-1889 which made him Villa joint 3rd top scorer along with Denny Hodgetts. (registration & fee required) Despite being one of the greats of the 19th century game, Hunter never fulfilled his dream of playing for Scotland against England. This is because at the time the Scottish Football Association had a policy of not picking 'Anglo-Scots' (i.e. Scots who played in the English League). Hunter originally came to Birmingham planning to sign for Calthorpe FC, but after failing to locate them was persuaded to sign for Villa instead after hearing of Aston Villa's Scottish connections. Hunter later recalled in his memoirs; He was idolized by the crowds and became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign. During a Football League match against Everton in 1890 Hunter suffered a heart attack and collapsed. He never played again, and died at the age of 35. It is said that, on his death-bed, he asked to be lifted up one last time to see the crowd going to Perry Barr (then Villa's home). His brother Andy also played for Villa, and scored their first ever FA Cup goal. One source said that there was no doubt that the auburn-haired Hunter was a great player - one of the best footballers of the 1880s and ‚Äò90s. He was an individualist with a commanding personality; he was robust yet decidedly fair and never committed a foul in anger. Known as ‚ÄòThe Old Warhorse‚Äô, he was a mixture of toughness and cleverness, a player who often ran down the touchline, pulling defenders all over the field.  Legacy  In 1998, Archie Hunter was inducted into the English Football League's list of 100 legends.

After establishing himself in 1972 as a resident of France, He immigrated to the United States in 1974 and has since lived and worked in New York City. Developing several individualistic styles in modern art, he is most famous for his unique work in terra cotta sculpture, involving heavily perforated surfaces and intriguing forms.  Early life  Born at the outbreak of World War II, Ney's early childhood was entrenched in difficulty. Two weeks before Ney became 2 years old, the Siege of Leningrad was launched, described by historians as the second most lethal battle in the war's tragic history. The pivotal city‚Äôs rail connections were severed, cutting off all access to any food and power supplies. In the following winter that ensued, between two and three million civilians‚Äîincluding 400,000 children‚Äîdied during the Leningrad Blockade. Biography After being given private art lessons at the home of influential Russian sculptor V.V. Lishev (1877‚Äì1960), from 1954 to 1957 Ney studied at the Art School of the Leningrad Academy of Arts, and later at the Art School of the Surikov Moscow Art Institute from 1957 to 1959. Ney befriended a wide number of progressive- minded art students, now stars of the contemporary Russian art scene such as Alexander Kosolapov, Leonid Sokov, Alexander Yulikov, Lev Nussberg and Vadim Kosmatschof. His relentless efforts in creating strikingly new interpretations of art quickly made the young artist legendary amidst his peers. Artists Alexander Kosolapov and Igor Makarevich, amongst others, recall that Ney played an influential role in their early years. From 1965 to 1967, Ney taught sculpture to children at the House of Young Pioneers in Leningrad. Students included future Russian novelist Sergei Dovlatov (1941‚Äì1990). In 1967 through 1969, Ney attended art history and theory courses at the Ilya Repin Institute. He continued to perfect his skills as both a painter and sculptor, as well as an art theoretician. Due to his highly productive creative output's clashing with the Soviet mandates of Socialist Realism, Ney absconded to France in 1972 on a tourist visa, as immigration was not permitted. His was granted residencies and established studios in the famed art colonies of both Cit√© internationale des arts in Paris and Villa Arson in Nice. In 1974, at the encouragement of American Abstract Expressionist painter Elaine de Kooning (wife of Willem), he immigrated with his family to the United States. Sculptor Stresses Ideas in His Ceramics, The Villager, February 20, 1994. Accessed July 18, 2012 One of the first of several noted cultural figures whose early departure inadvertently signaled the start of a new wave of American immigrants from the Soviet Union, the legendary late American designer Gene Moore discovered Ney's work at a chance meeting at The Russian Tea Room. As the longtime Vice President of the flagship landmark location of Tiffany & Co. on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, having displayed the works of contemporary artists Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Andy Warhol, Moore created displays featuring Ney's works annually since 1978 for over thirty years.Gene Moore and Judith S. Goldman. Windows & Tiffany's: The Art of Gene Moore. New York: Harry S. Abrams, 1980.

In 2009, the National Centre for Contemporary Arts (NCCA) in Moscow held a special anniversary exhibition to honor the artist's 70th anniversary. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote in the accompanying publication's introductory forward: ‚Ä≥Throughout his career, Mr. Ney has made an indelible impact on the creative life of our City and beyond‚Äîbuilding a diverse and unique range of work that has inspired and moved individuals from around the world. What‚Äôs more, Mr. Ney‚Äôs success demonstrates the boundless potential of the New York immigrant experience, and his hard work and perseverance set a wonderful example for us all.

He was a professor at the University of Strasbourg from 1945 to 1959 and then at the Sorbonne; in 1967 he was invited to teach at the University of Michigan, and in 1973, he was elected to the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Cahen was married and had six children, including the historian Michel Cahen, who wrote a biography of his father.Michel CAHEN: L'Historien et le Politique: Engagement et Pens√©e Scientifique chez Claude Cahen.

Cahen was a member of the French Communist Party from the 1930s until 1960, and remained an active Marxist afterwards. Despite his origins, he neither self-identified as Jewish nor supported the State of Israel. In 1954 he published \\"An Introduction to the First Crusade\\" in the Oxford journal Past and Present. Cahen has been called \\"the doyen of Islamic social history and one of the most influential Islamic historians of [his] century,\\"Paul M. Cobb, review of Curiel and Gyselen (1995) in Journal of Near Eastern Studies 57 (1998), p. 220 and \\"the best historian of the Middle East in the twentieth century.\\" Mark Cohen describes him as a distinguished Islamic historian.Mark Cohen (1994) p.xvii He was a prisoner of war in World War II.

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 10.67, which is much too faint to be seen with the naked eye. However, it can be viewed with even a modest telescope of aperture. In 2004, the existence of an extrasolar planet, Gliese 436b, was verified as orbiting the star. This planet was later discovered to transit its host star. Properties Gliese 436 is a M2.5V star, which means it is a red dwarf. Stellar models give an estimated size of about 42% of the Sun's radius. The same model predicts that the outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 3,318 K, giving it the orange-red hue of an M-type star. Small stars such as this generate energy at a low rate, giving it only 2.5% of the Sun's luminosity. Gliese 436 is older than the Sun by several billion years and it has an abundance of heavy elements (with masses greater than helium-4) equal to 48% that of the Sun. The projected rotation velocity is 1.0 km/s, and the chromosphere has a low level of magnetic activity. Gliese 436 is a member of the \\"old-disk population\\" with velocity components in the galactic coordinate system of U=+44, V=‚àí20 and W=+20 km/s. Planetary system The star is orbited by one known planet, designated Gliese 436 b. The planet has an orbital period of 2.6 Earth days and transits the star as viewed from Earth. It has a mass of 22.2 Earth masses and is roughly 55,000 km in diameter, giving it a mass and radius similar to the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune in the Solar System. In general, Doppler spectroscopy measurements do not measure the true mass of the planet, but instead measure the product m sin i, where m is the true mass and i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the line-of-sight and the normal to the planet's orbital plane), a quantity that is generally unknown. However, for Gliese 436 b, the transits enable the determination of the inclination, as they show that the planet's orbital plane is very nearly in the line of sight (i.e. that the inclination is close to 90 degrees). Hence the mass quoted is the actual mass. The planet is thought to be largely composed of hot ices with an outer envelope of hydrogen and helium, and is termed a \\"hot Neptune\\". GJ 436 b's orbit is likely misaligned with its star's rotation. In addition the planet's orbit is eccentric. Because tidal forces would tend to circularise the orbit of the planet on short timescales, this suggested that Gliese 436 b is being perturbed by an additional planet orbiting the star. =Possible second planet= In 2008, a second planet, designated \\"Gliese 436 c\\" was claimed to have been discovered, with an orbital period of 5.2 days and an orbital semimajor axis of 0.045 AU. The planet was thought to have a mass of roughly 5 Earth masses and have a radius about 1.5 times larger than the Earth's. Due to its size, the planet was thought to be a rocky, terrestrial planet. It was announced by Spanish scientists in April 2008 by analyzing its influence on the orbit of Gliese 436 b.Reuters Further analysis showed that the transit length of the inner planet is not changing, a situation which rules out most possible configurations for this system. Also, if it did orbit at these parameters, the system would be the only \\"unstable\\" orbit on UA's Extrasolar Planet Interactions chart. The existence of this \\"Gliese 436 c\\" was thus regarded as unlikely, and the discovery was eventually retracted at the Transiting Planets conference in Boston, 2008. Despite the retraction, studies concluded that the possibility that there is an additional planet orbiting Gliese 436 remained plausible. With the aid of an unnoticed transit automatically recorded at NMSU on January 11, 2005, and observations by amateur astronomers, it has been suggested that there is a trend of increasing inclination of the orbit of Gliese 436 b, though this trend remains unconfirmed. This trend is compatible with a perturbation by a planet of less than 12 Earth masses on an orbit within about 0.08 AU of the star. =Two sub- Earth candidates= In July 2012, NASA announced that astronomers at the University of Central Florida, using the Spitzer Space Telescope, strongly believed they had observed a second planet. This candidate planet was given the preliminary designation UCF-1.01, after the University of Central Florida. It was measured to have a radius of around two thirds that of Earth and, assuming an Earth-like density of 5.5 g/cm3, was estimated to have a mass of 0.3 times that of Earth and a surface gravity of around two thirds that of Earth. It orbits at 0.0185 AU from the star, every 1.3659 days. The astronomers also believe they have found some evidence for an additional planet candidate, UCF-1.02, which is of a similar size, though with only one detected transit its orbital period is unknown. Follow up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope as well as a reanalysis of the spitzer data were unable to confirm these planets.

Background The Spanish were using undersea cables as a means to communicate with not only the rest of Cuba, but also the Spanish command. These cables had many key junctions, namely, a shore near Cienfuegos. The cables connected to Havana, the port of Santiago, and then branched off to other Caribbean islands such as Jamaica. The cables were run out from an easily located house which contained a critical hub for the undersea cable system. While the house could easily be destroyed, this would only inflict largely superficial damage, and could easily be repaired and functioning in a short period of time. Therefore, command decided to grapple the three cables out of the sea and cut them in several places, disrupting much of the communications between the Spanish and their operations in Cuba. This damage would be much more difficult to repair, as the cables were nearing two inches in diameter which made cutting, and by extension repairing them, a difficult task. For the mission, the cruiser USS Marblehead, the gunboat USS Nashville, and the revenue cutter USS WindomNofi, A.A., 1996, The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898, Pennsylvania: Combined Books, were dispatched under the command of Captain Bowman H. McCalla to sever them. Battle Carpenter's Mate 3/class William Meyer awarded Medal of Honor The Marblehead and Nashville both opened fire on the cable house at 6:45 a.m. on May 11, 1898. Rather quickly, the cable house collapsed from the fire from the two warships. Ten minutes later, at 6:55 a.m. the warships dispatched their work boats, each carrying a minimal crew of sixteen, in order to minimize the risk of casualty. The element of surprise was quickly lost, as a Spanish Cavalryman spotted the ships en route to the beach. While the first cable was out of the line of fire, the second cable was not so easy to cut. Because of coral formation, the cable was very difficult to snare in order to bring it up to the surface and cut. The Spanish forces were also much closer to the second cable, so the crew had to contend with both of these problems. In order to suppress the increased fire from the Spanish forces, both warships increased their bombardment. As the raid crew hauled up the second cable to cut it, they discovered a third, smaller cable. After the second had been cut, they moved on to find this third and final cable. They were not able to however, as a large contingent of Spanish forces arrived from Cienfuegos to repel what they thought at the time was a full-scale invasion. By 11:15 a.m. the raid was over. After a tense, hour-long firefight, two cables were cut, and the sailors and Marines withdrew, but a third cable near the shore remained untouched. Aftermath Fifty-two US sailors and marines were awarded the Medal of Honor for \\"setting an example of extraordinary bravery and coolness under fire.\\"http://www.history.army.mil/moh/warspain.html References Naval battles of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Battles involving Cuba Battle of Cienfuegos Battle of Cienfuegos Conflicts in 1898 United States Marine Corps in the 18th and 19th centuries Battle of Cienfuegos ","title":"Battle of Cienfuegos"},{"id":"1212495","text":"Mountain running is a sports discipline which takes place mainly off-road in mountainous terrain, but if there is significant elevation gain on the route, surfaced roads may be used.

It is recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federations and governed by the World Mountain Running Association that since 1985 organizes world championships. International federation The World Mountain Running Association (WMRA) is the global governing body of mountain running. For IAAF purposes, mountain running takes place on terrain that is mainly off-road, but if there is significant elevation gain on the route, surfaced roads may be used. Courses involve considerable amounts of ascent (for mainly uphill races), or both ascent and descent (for up and down races with the start and finish at similar heights). The average incline is normally between five and twenty per cent. Courses are clearly marked and should avoid dangerous sections. World championships The WMRA organizes two different types of world championships, for regular distances the World Mountain Running Championships (until 2008 called World Mountain Running Trophy) and long distances the World Long Distance Mountain Running Championships (until 2014 called World Long Distance Mountain Running Challenge). Long distance mountain running Races more than 20 km, but no longer than 45 km, includes an uphill ascent of at least 1.6 km.

Originally an anarchist, he joined the Bolsheviks five months after arriving in Petrograd in January 1919 and later worked for the Comintern as a journalist, editor and translator. He was critical of the Stalinist regime and remained a revolutionary Marxist until his death. He is best remembered for his Memoirs of a Revolutionary and series of seven \\"witness-novels\\" chronicling the lives of revolutionaries of the first half of the 20th century. Biography =Early life= Serge was born in Brussels, Belgium, to a couple of impoverished Russian anti-Czarist exiles. His father, Leo (Lev) Kibalchich, a former infantry trooper from Kiev, has been variously described as a distant relativeVictor Serge, Memoirs of a Revolutionary, University of Iowa Press 2002 p.2. or a cousinJ. Hoberman, The Red Atlantis:Communist Culture in the Absence of Communism, Temple University Press 2000 p.98 of Nikolai Kibalchich of the People's Will revolutionary organization, who was executed on a charge of being responsible for the bomb used in the assassination of Alexander II in 1881. Leo, himself a Peoples' Will sympathiser, had fled Russia around 1887 and gone to Switzerland, where he met Serge's mother, Vera Frolova, n√©e Pederowska. She was the daughter of an impoverished petty nobleman of Polish extraction from the Nizhni-Novgorod province. Vera had married a Saint Petersburg official and, after giving birth to two daughters, had received permission to go to Switzerland to study and heal her consumptive lungs, but also to escape the reactionary environment of Saint Petersburg. She fell in love with the handsome, feckless Kibalchich, and the couple wandered Europe, according to their son, \\"in search of cheap lodgings and good libraries\\". Victor was born \\"by chance\\" in Brussels, where the couple were so poor that Victor's younger brother died of malnutrition before Leonid eventually found work as a teacher at the Institute of Anatomy. The \\"Kibalchich myth\\" of revolutionary idealism and sacrifice dominated Victor's impoverished childhood. He read a great deal, and became interested in socialism and anarchism along with his friends, including Raymond Callemin and Jean de Bo√´. Serge's parents broke up in 1905, when he was 15. Living on his own from then on, he and his friends soon joined the Socialist Young Guards (youth section of the Belgian Workers' Party), but soon came to feel that it was not radical enough, loudly protesting the Party's support for the annexation of the Congo. Meanwhile, he and his friends were hanging out at an anarchist commune in the forest near Brussels, where they learned the printing trades and put out a newspaper. They became increasingly involved in anarchism and increasingly under suspicion in Brussels, especially after defending their Russian comrade Hartenstein, who had made a bomb and shot at Belgian policemen at Gand. Serge left Brussels in 1909 and, after a stay in the Ardennes, moved to Paris, where he made his living teaching French to Russians and anonymously translating Russian novels by Artzybachev. Serge's first published article was written in September 1908. Under the pen name \\"Le R√©tif\\" (\\"The Maverick\\" or \\"The Stubborn One\\"), Serge wrote many articles for Le R√©volt√© and, starting in 1909, L'Anarchie, a journal founded by Albert Libertad, whom Serge and his friends considered to be a hero. Serge at this stage was an outspoken supporter of individualist anarchism and illegalism, often clashing with the editor of L'Anarchie, Andr√© Roulot (aka \\"Lorulot\\"), who favoured less inflammatory rhetoric. In 1910, after a schism in L'Anarchie, Lorulot departed and Serge was named as the new editor of the paper. During this time, Serge was in a relationship with Rirette Maitrejean, another anarchist activist. In 1913, Serge was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to five years in solitary confinement for his involvement with the Bonnot Gang of anarchist bandits, although he was innocent of participation in any of their robberies. Several of his comrades, including his childhood friend, Raymond Callemin, were executed and others, like Jean de Bo√´, condemned to Devil's Island. He was thus in prison on the outbreak of the First World War. He immediately forecast that the war would lead to a Russian Revolution: \\"Revolutionaries knew quite well that the autocratic Empire, with its hangmen, its pogroms, its finery, its famines, its Siberian jails and ancient iniquity, could never survive the war.\\" In September 1914, Serge was in the Melun prison on an island in the Seine, about 25 miles from the Battle of the Marne. The local population, suspecting a French defeat, began to flee, and for a while Serge and the other inmates expected to become German prisoners. Expelled from France on his release in 1917, he moved to Spain, which was neutral in World War I but was the scene of an attempted syndicalist revolution. Around this time, he first used the name Victor Serge, as a pen name for an article in the newspaper Tierra y Libertad. Nicholas II was overthrown in February, 1917, and in July Serge decided to travel to Russia for the first time in his life, to participate in the revolutionary activities there. In order to get there, he returned to France and tried to join the Russian troops fighting there. He studied art history for two months, but was then arrested for violating the expulsion order. He was imprisoned without trial for more than a year in wartime concentration camps at Fleury (described by e.e. cummings in The Enormous Room) and at Pr√©cign√©, where he engaged in political discussions with fellow prisoners and first learned about Bolshevism. In October 1918, the Danish Red Cross intervened, arranging for Serge and other revolutionaries to be exchanged for Bruce Lockhart and other anti-Bolsheviks who had been imprisoned in Russia. =Career in the Soviet Union= During the Civil War Soon after Serge arrived in Russia, in January 1919, he joined the Bolsheviks, having grown disillusioned with anarchism, and believing that anarchism was a good ideal for life but Bolshevism offered the best theory of political change. He continued to support the involvement of anarchists and non-Bolshevik socialists in the revolution, and joined social groups largely containing non-Bolsheviks, such as the circle around the novelist Andrei Bely. While Serge was a staunch internationalist, believing that revolutions in other countries were desirable and even necessary for the survival of the Soviet Union, and wishing for socialism to succeed across the planet, he was concerned about the Bolsheviks‚Äô desire to force world revolution, particularly believing that France was far from revolutionary conditions. He also believed that while revolutionary conditions were ripe in Germany, the necessary revolutionary consciousness was lacking. Serge lived in Petrograd, the former Saint Petersburg, which was going through a difficult period. At one time, he lived in a mansion that had belonged to a noble family. With no other way to keep warm, Serge and his companions began burning books, and he was particularly happy to burn a book of the laws of the Russian empire. Serge met Maxim Gorky and was offered a position at the publishing house that Gorky was running, Universal Literature. Though Serge deeply admired Gorky, he declined the position. At first he made his living as an inspector of schools and as a lecturer for the Petrograd Soviet. In March 1919, he began working for Grigory Zinoviev, who had been appointed as President of the Executive of the Third International. Serge's knowledge of languages enabled him to help in the publishing of foreign-language editions of the organization's publications, but he was already criticizing what he saw as Zinoviev's bureaucratic tendencies. Serge was a very capable worker in the Comintern and was particularly known for meeting people who visited the Soviet Union from various nations, including Pierre Naville, Gerard Rosenthal, Nikos Kazantzakis and Panait Istrati. He also worked to help those who, he believed, were being unjustly persecuted by the secret police. Serge married Liuba Russakova, and they had their first child, Vlady, in 1920. The Russakovs were a Russian Jewish family who had been expelled from France and had traveled to Petrograd on the same boat as Serge. Liuba's father, Alexander Russakov, was also a revolutionary, who had moved to France after the 1905 revolution, while always continuing to be a worker and returning to factory work after his return to Russia. Liuba herself briefly served as Lenin's stenographer in 1921. Her health problems became a major concern for Serge. Serge had arrived in Russia during the civil war and the era of war communism. At first, he believed that the Soviets could not afford to be merciful to their enemies, and he once criticized officers who let White Army prisoners go without shooting them. This was a reaction to the persecution of communists and other revolutionaries in the rest of the world. However, his positions on such issues soon changed as the government continued to be just as harsh against dissenters after the end of the civil war as it had been during it. Serge soon became disillusioned, and joined with Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman to complain about the way the Red Army treated the sailors involved in the Kronstadt Uprising. He believed that, with more competent officials in charge of negotiations, there could have been a settlement between the government and the sailors. However, Serge reluctantly sided with the Bolshevik Party on the Kronstadt rebellion, because, in his view, it better represented the interests of the workers, and the alternative was counter-revolution. As a libertarian socialist, Serge protested against the Red Terror organized by Felix Dzerzhinsky and the Cheka. Serge also criticized the New Economic Policy, believing that it was counter-revolutionary, though in 1923 he admitted that it had resulted in improved conditions compared to war communism. In the spring of 1921, Serge briefly withdrew from the government and began a commune on an abandoned estate near Petrograd. However, after three months the commune was abandoned because of hostility from anti-Semitic peasants, who thought that all the residents of the commune were Jews. Foreign missions Serge then went on a Comintern assignment to Germany, where there was an active Communist Party. Living mainly in Berlin, he witnessed the effects of economic crisis throughout Germany. Though he was still worried about repression in the Soviet Union, his stay in Germany restored his pride in the accomplishments of the Russian Revolution. Though he returned to Moscow to attend meetings several times, he lived in Germany until November 1923, when he was forced to leave after the failed Communist insurrection in October and the fascist coup attempt in November. Serge harshly criticized the bureaucratic nature of the Comintern and its attempts to determine when revolutions \\"should\\" occur on the basis of inaccurate information and dogmatic preconceptions. He criticized the increasing control of the Comintern by the Soviet government, and particularly the factions of Zinoviev and Stalin. He cited the situation in Germany in 1923 as a major example of their mistakes. Along with German communist leaders such as Heinrich Brandler, Serge had worked in Germany to promote a workers‚Äô revolution, which was eventually cancelled and occurred only in Hamburg because the party there had not heard of the cancellation. Serge believed that the working class in Germany was not ready for revolution because it was too moderate. Serge criticized the Social Democrats in Germany, felt that the Communists had poor organization, and recognised the danger of fascism there. In 1923, Serge became associated with the Left Opposition group that included Leon Trotsky, Karl Radek, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Adolf Joffe. Serge was an outspoken critic of the authoritarian government of Joseph Stalin and his allies. He is believed to have been the first writer to describe the Soviet government as \\"totalitarian\\". Later in 1923, Serge moved to Vienna, Austria. Austria was then ruled by the Social Democrats and the Communist Party was so small that there was no possibility of revolution there. However, many Communists were working or in exile in Vienna, and Serge befriended some of them, including Georg Luk√°cs, Adolf Joffe and Antonio Gramsci. Serge watched political events in Russia, Germany and elsewhere, but could participate little, and worked on other pursuits, such as literary analysis. Left Opposition Serge returned to the Soviet Union in 1925. Soon after his arrival Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, members of the ruling troika alongside Stalin, reconciled with Trotsky, and the United Opposition was formed. Serge was generally supportive of the United Opposition, despite continued disagreements on economic and other matters between its Trotskyist and \\"Zinovievist\\" members. Meanwhile, Serge moved to Leningrad (the former Petrograd), where he was actively involved in Opposition groups. Despite the support of Kamenev and Zinoviev, Stalin's allies were gaining more and more power, and the opposition often had to meet in secret. Serge soon realized that the defeat of the opposition was inevitable, and by 1927, the tenth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, he concluded that the reaction had been completed. He often compared the defeat of the Left Opposition to the Thermidorian Reaction that followed the French Revolution. Serge was not one of the political or theoretical leaders of the Left Opposition, but he worked tirelessly to promote it through both writing and activism. At that time he agreed with Trotsky that their fight should remain within the party, but he later wrote that \\"party patriotism\\" had helped to defeat them, while admitting that there were no other organizations with mass support that could have challenged the party. Serge was one of the few members of the opposition who could speak at Communist Party meetings without being shouted down by hecklers, though he was given only five minutes to speak at each meeting. In late 1927, most of the Opposition, including Trotsky and Zinoviev, was expelled from the party, and some, led by Zinoviev, capitulated in order to return to the party. Serge believed that the expulsion of the opposition meant that the party was completely broken, and refused to support the capitulation. From then on, he believed that the ban on additional political parties was wrong. After Stalin's victory In 1928, Serge was expelled from the Communist Party, largely because of his protests against the Soviet Union's policy on China, and officially because of his protests over the party congress's expulsion of the Opposition. He was now unable to work for the government. Over the next few years, he spent much of his time writing Year One of the Russian Revolution (1930), completing two novels, Men in Prison (1930) and Birth of Our Power (1931), and translating Vera Figner's –ó–∞–ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–ª—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä—É–¥ (English title: Memoirs of a Revolutionary) from Russian into French (Les M√©moires d'un r√©volutionnaire). These books were banned in the Soviet Union, but were published in France and Spain. He also commented on and tried to investigate the murders of political dissenters. Amid the growing poverty and peasant resistance, which was brutally crushed, he also wrote commentaries on these aspects of Soviet life. Serge was arrested in March 1928 and spent two months in jail without charge. While some French intellectuals who had been among his close comrades, such as Henri Barbusse, harshly criticized his continued opposition to Stalin, others continued to help him and soon won his release. Soon after release, Serge suffered serious health problems, particularly an intestinal occlusion of which he almost died, and this drove him to devote himself to writing. During the next five years of \\"precarious liberty\\", he worked at the Lenin Institute, translating the works of Lenin into foreign languages, though his translations were closely monitored by the censors and he did not receive any credit. He lived in a communal apartment in Leningrad with at least three people who openly monitored him as they worked for the GPU. Serge's family was targeted for harassment, particularly his father-in-law Alexander Russakov, who was denied work, arrested for a time and denied a bread card. He died in 1934. Serge's wife Liuba Russakova was driven insane. Serge could not meet friends and relatives openly, because they could get into trouble for contacting him, so when he visited Moscow he often slept in empty houses. However, he occasionally met the remaining free opposition members secretly, and had some contacts with former friends who worked for Stalin. He also worked as hard as possible to smuggle anti-government material out of the Soviet Union. Trotsky received his last communication from the Soviet opposition from Serge in 1929. Serge was arrested and imprisoned again in March 1933. This time he was not released quickly. The arrest occurred while Serge was in the street trying to buy medicine for his wife. He was held and interrogated at the Lubyanka prison, where he spent 85 days in solitary confinement. The GPU claimed to have obtained a confession from his sister-in-law and former secretary, Anita Russakova, that she and Serge had been involved in a conspiracy led by Trotsky. Serge knew from his contacts in the Communist Party that if he signed the confession he would be executed. The GPU's claim was later proven to be entirely false (though Anita Russakova herself was arrested in 1936). Eventually, the GPU dropped this part of the case, stating that the \\"evidence from Anita\\" was not necessary, though Serge never knew that she had not made any confession. Serge never signed a confession of his own, though he did eventually sign a statement agreeing to his sentence of three years in Administrative Exile in Orenburg on the Ural River. As he travelled to Orenburg, Serge was finally able to meet and have discussions with Left Oppositionists who were also being deported. Orenburg was an impoverished town and he had to struggle for food. He could not work because he refused to declare his support for the general line of the party. He depended on parcels of food from his wife and money from the sale of his books in France. However, after his first year in Orenburg, the GPU largely cut off mail delivery to and from Serge. Serge addressed manuscripts to the French writer Romain Rolland, who was sympathetic to Stalin but was against Serge's repression, but many manuscripts that Serge tried to send were 'lost' (confiscated by the GPU). Paradoxically, the postal insurance payments on the missing packages helped Serge survive. Serge's wife and their son Vlady joined him in Orenburg in 1934, but he sent her back to Moscow to treat her mental illness. In Moscow, she gave birth to their second child, a daughter named Jeannine. Vlady stayed with Serge. After their mail was cut off, they subsisted on a soup of cabbage, water and salt. Serge became gravely ill at the end of 1934 and spent time in a hospital under terrible conditions. Despite these difficulties, he was able to make friends with many of the deportees who were also political prisoners. His novel Midnight in the Century is based on his time in Orenburg. Noting that the Soviet Union was in economic recovery by 1935, Serge predicted that Stalin would choose normalization, but by 1936 the terror was expanding, using the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934 as a pretext. (Serge believed that Kirov had been killed by an assassin acting alone, with no involvement by either the opposition or Stalinists.) Protests against Serge's imprisonment took place at several international conferences, most notably the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture in 1935 in Paris. Protests came from intellectuals of various political ideologies, including Georges Duhamel, Charles Vildrac, Boris Souvarine, Andr√© Gide and Romain Rolland. Serge was able to correspond with Gide, and had a strong influence on him, later telling Gide to \\"keep [his] eyes wide open\\" while visiting the Soviet Union in 1936. Rolland corresponded with Genrikh Yagoda about Serge's manuscripts, eventually visited the Soviet Union and had meetings with Stalin during which Serge was mentioned. The Serge case caused the Soviet government considerable embarrassment and in 1936 Joseph Stalin announced that he was considering releasing Serge from prison. The French prime minister Pierre Laval refused to grant Serge an entry permit, but Emile Vandervelde, a veteran socialist who by then was a member of the Belgian government, managed to obtain Serge a visa to live in Belgium. Serge was ordered to return to Moscow and arrived there on April 12, 1936. As he prepared to leave the Soviet Union, he tried to get permission to take his manuscripts with him, but they were taken from him. He left the country safely with his wife and children, but their relatives were not so fortunate: Anita Russakova spent 25 years in a gulag (and was eventually able to give her version of events after 1989), while Serge's sister, his mother-in-law and two of his brothers-in-law all died in prison. = Later life = In Belgium and France Soon after Serge's arrival in Belgium, he immediately began corresponding with anti- Stalinist socialists, including Leon Trotsky and his son Leon Sedov. His mail was still often intercepted, both by Stalinist agents and spies for western countries. Trotsky welcomed Serge warmly, gave him work as his French translator, and urged him, through his emissary A. J. Muste, to join the IVth International. However, Serge found the organization sterile and sectarian. Meanwhile, Trotsky had many disagreements with other non-Stalinist leftists, and was unhappy that Serge continued to associate with his critics. Former GPU operatives like Elsa Reiss also distrusted Serge because they felt that he could not have been released unless Stalin thought that he would be useful. These allegations were untrue, but caused difficulties for Serge. Serge's escape from the USSR preceded by a few months the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and Stalin's first Moscow show-trial of Lenin's companions. Thanks to his own experience of GPU interrogation, Serge was able to analyse and unmask the 'mystery' of the false confessions, but the big newspapers rejected his truthful testimony for fear of offending the Communists, who were part of the anti-fascist Popular Front alliance. Moreover, until mid-1937, Serge was stuck in Brussels, deprived of his Soviet passport and still banned in France. Serge's testimony about USSR appeared in the Belgian union paper La Wallonie, in the small syndicalist journal La R√©volution prol√©tarienne, and in two books about Soviet Communism, From Lenin to Stalin (1937) and Destiny of a Revolution (1937) which have remained classics. During this time, coinciding with the Spanish Civil War, Serge was the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) correspondent in Paris.Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.) George Orwell: Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters (1940‚Äì1943), (Penguin) He warned the POUM leaders, like Andreu Nin P√©rez, that Stalin was planning Moscow-style treason trials for them in Spain, but they failed to heed him and take precautions. Along with his political writings, Serge also published a volume of poems, Resistance (1938). Many of these poems were actually written in Russia, but the manuscripts were among those confiscated from him and he reconstructed them from memory. In 1939, he published Midnight in the Century, his novel about deported Oppositionists in 'Black Waters' (Orenburg). Around the time of Serge's arrival in France, Mark Zborowski \\"Etienne\\" was becoming a powerful person in the French Trotskyist movement, as a confidant of Leon Sedov. Zborowski, who turned out later to be a GPU agent, successfully used Serge's disagreements with other Trotskyists to spread distrust of Serge within the Trotskyist movement, which poisoned Trotsky's relations with Serge. However, their political break was based on differences over two topics: the role of the POUM in the Spanish revolution (which Serge defended) and the Bolsheviks' brutal repression of the 1921 revolt of the Kronstadt sailors (which Serge criticised). The Serge-Trotsky correspondence (including private letters and public polemics) fills a volume, and after Trotsky's death Serge collaborated with his widow, Natalia Sedova, on an authorized biography: \\"Life and Death of Leon Trotsky\\" (1947). In Mexico After France was invaded by Germany in 1940, Serge, together with his son, Vlady Kibalchich, and his partner, Laurette S√©journ√©, managed to escape to the Unoccupied Zone in the South. Serge's wife Liuba had long been confined to a mental institution-their daughter was being cared for by a couple in the country. (Liuba remained in France until her death in 1985. Jeannine was brought to Mexico by Laurette S√©journ√© in 1942 and lived there until her death in 2011). Serge, Vlady and Laurette spent the winter of 1940‚Äì41 at the Villa Air Bel in , which they shared with Varian Fry, of the American Rescue Committee, the Surrealist Andr√© Breton and his family, Daniel B√©n√©dite, Mary Jayne Gold and others. With both the Gestapo and the GPU on his trail, Serge was desperate to leave France, but as an undocumented Russian with a Communist past, he faced the nightmare of what Trotsky famously called 'A world without a visa'. At the last possible moment, thanks to the efforts of Dwight and Nancy Macdonald in New York and Juli√°n Gorkin and Wolfgang Paalen in Mexico, Serge and Vlady took the last ship out of Marseille (on which Breton and the anthropologist Claude L√©vi- Strauss were cabin passengers). After a six-month journey to the Caribbean, they were imprisoned in Martinique and the Dominican Republic, and arrived in Mexico several months after Trotsky's assassination in Mexico City. Vlady and his son Victor, along with Breton and Pierre Mabille stopped at the Dominican Republic in 1940-41. Vlady and his son lived in the capital with the Spanish surrealist painter Eugenio Granell and his wife Amparo. Although the Granell's did not have much money (they were also refugees form the Spanish Civil War where Granell had belonged to the POUM party), Amparo did all she could to get tea and sugar for Victor and his son. When the two parted towards Mexico, Vlady left an important manuscript which now can be found at the Biblioteca Granell in the Fundaci√≥n Eugenio Granell, Santiago de Compostela. This manuscript, titled and hand written at the time, \\"L'empire contre le peuple Russe (titre proximaire\\" -difficult to read the hand written words in French. This book eventually became \\"Hitler contra Stalin\\" which was published later on in 1941 in Mexico City. Victor Serge in Wolfgang Paalen¬¥s Studio in Mexico ca. 1944 The Nazis invaded the Soviet Union during Serge's travels to Mexico, and Gorkin commissioned him to write a book on the subject (Hitler Contra Stalin) which was published in Mexico City. However, agents of the Russian Embassy, furious at Serge's critical analysis, soon bought out the publishing house and made sure that all doors to journalism were closed to Serge, who as a result often had little money for food. He was supported in part by his partner Laurette S√©journ√©, who arrived from France with his daughter Jeannine, and he developed friendships with some other European exiles including the German Council Communist Otto Ruhle, members of the exiled POUM, the German novelist and hero of the International Brigade, Gustav Regler, the Austrian painter and theorist Wolfgang Paalen, the French Socialist Marceau Pivert, and the Franco-Polish novelist Jean Malaquais. His relations with Trotsky's widow Natalia Sedova were strained at first. He continued to receive support from some American intellectuals, such as Dwight Macdonald and John Dewey, and his writings were published in Partisan Review and the New International in the US; he was also the Mexican correspondent for the New Leader. Wolfgang Paalen and his wife Alice hid Serge occasionally in their house in San Angel and Serge advised Paalen in his planned criticism of the Marxist Dialectics for his review DYN.Neufert, Andreas (2015), Auf Liebe und Tod. Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin: Parthas, , p. 472 and 532.(In German) The Communist establishment publicly denounced him as a Trotskyist, and he was strongly criticised by the Mexican press and by the veteran Communist propagandists Otto Katz (writing under the pen name Andr√© Simone) and Paul Merker. Serge was charged with being a fascist secret agent, like Trotsky had been. A public meeting where Serge was to speak was broken up by an armed mob of thugs sent by the Mexican Communist Party. His friend Enrique Gironella of the POUM was seriously wounded, and Serge barely escaped alive. However, he found support from the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, participated in the group Socialismo y Libertad, and co-authored Los problemas del socialismo en nuestro tiempo with Marceau Pivert and Juli√°n Gorkin. After the United States and the Soviet Union became temporary allies in 1942, criticism of Serge spread to the American press, and though he had staunch defenders there, his ability to defend himself was limited by the fact that he was still distrusted by many Trotskyists. Serge and his allies in Mexico were also victims of several assassination attempts by the GPU and Mexican Stalinists. As Serge became increasingly unable to publish articles, he continued to write novels, including The Long Dusk, concerning the fall of France to the Nazis, and The Case of Comrade Tulayev, about the Stalinist purges (starting with the killing of Sergei Kirov). His autobiography, Memoirs of a Revolutionary, was first published posthumously in Paris in 1951.Susan Weissman, Victor Serge: The Course is Set on Hope, Verso, London 2001 p. 321:Victor Serge, M√©moires d'un r√©volutionnaire, 1901‚Äì1941, Seuil, Paris 1951. Translated Peter Sedgwick, Memoirs of a Revolutionary, Oxford University Press, 1963. Serge's health had been badly damaged by his periods of imprisonment in France and Russia, but he continued to write until he died of heart attack,The Guardian, 17 August 2012 just after entering a taxi in Mexico City, on 17 November 1947. Having no nationality, no Mexican cemetery could legally take his body, so he was buried as a 'Spanish Republican.' Several controversies have surrounded the end of Serge's life. There have been suspicions that Serge, who was on the GPU assassination list, was poisoned on Stalin's orders. However, there is no evidence to indicate this. It has also been rumoured that Serge had abandoned socialism, because a few weeks after his death Andr√© Malraux published excerpts of a personal letter written six days before his death, implying that he would join him in support of the Gaullist cause. Serge's defenders point out that Serge wrote to Malraux, who was an editor at the Gallimard publishing house, as a friend attempting to reestablish a relationship and eager to get his novel published in France, and that Serge's words were taken out of context. Serge's last published articles, written weeks before his death, reiterate his support for the Bolshevik Revolution and warn his comrades against truckling with American-style anti- Communism. Ideas =On the Russian Revolution and the Civil War= Year One of the Russian Revolution presents Serge's interpretation of the events that happened in Russia during his second imprisonment in France. He refutes the idea that the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 was a coup d'√©tat, explains that the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk were necessary. He also emphasized the role of Germany in the bloody repression of the democratically elected Finnish revolution and that of the Allies in arming the White Terror, foreshadowing the Russian Civil War and the Bolshevik government's view that it was necessary to institute the Red Terror. Serge was one of the few historians of this period to give prominent attention to the role of Finland in early Soviet history and to point to the repression of the German Revolution in 1919 as closing the period of Communist expansion. =On the rise of Stalin= Serge became a major historian of the struggles of the Left Opposition. He stated that around 1926 some oppositionists felt that Trotsky could have organized a coup, as he was still supported by the Red Army. However, Trotsky feared (and Serge agreed) that such a military revolution would only create a dictatorship similar to that of Napoleon Bonaparte after the French Revolution. Serge saw the party as developing a kind of religious feeling among many of those who were expelled, so that expulsion -- 'political death' -- seemed to them like excommunication from a church. Serge's biography Portrait de Staline was published in 1940, but suppressed in France. His portrait of a very human Stalin in The Case of Comrade Tulayev is considered realistic. =On the Stalinist economy= Beginning in the late 1920s, Serge helped to lead the anti-Stalinist Left's criticism of wasteful resource management in the Soviet economy, along with many other writers including Christian Rakovsky and Leon Trotsky. Serge's writing includes many examples of the building of inefficient buildings, factories, homes and machines. He pointed out that, while the Moscow subway stations were architecturally grand, they had no benches for tired workers. He criticized the bureaucrats who approved these projects out of political loyalty, and stated that these bureaucrats, though they claimed to be Communists, did not really care about the workers. Like many other Left Oppositionists, he pointed out that Stalin had no authentic plan, but instead shifted policies erratically. =On state Marxism= Serge's libertarian tendency made him convinced that if the Soviet Union or any state used an ideology, no matter how scientific, it would be used to repress free thought: =On China= During the late 1920s, around the time of the decline of the Left Opposition and Serge's expulsion from the party, Serge spent much time and energy writing about China. China had an attempted revolution around that time but it was stopped by the Comintern, which ordered the Chinese Communists into a disastrous alliance with the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang soon betrayed the Communists and massacred them. Although Serge was never able to visit China, his analysis was based on the reports of those who had visited China. Serge noted that the Kuomintang had developed a bureaucratic authoritarian structure similar to that of the Soviet Communist party and the Comintern under Stalin. He argued that the proletariat needed to make an alliance with the peasants in a way that would depart from liberalism and nationalism. He also praised the early works attributed to Mao Zedong, who was not well known at the time. Serge's works on China influenced the French intellectual debate on China and also the later writings of Trotsky on China. =On literature= Serge always maintained that writers and artists need free expression, regardless of their political views. In this opinion, he was supported by the prominent Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin, with whom he disagreed on economic and many other issues. Even after committing himself to Communism, Serge maintained friendships with anarchist, Christian and non-political artists, often considering them superior to artists fostered by the state. When unable to participate in politics, during his time in Vienna and when imprisoned, Serge wrote essays about Soviet art and culture, and analyzed the contributions of many early Soviet writers and artists. He was also influenced by Trotsky's views on Soviet culture, but differed slightly with Trotsky's blanket rejection of the idea of a proletarian literature arising before the achievement of socialism (whose literature would be 'classless'). Serge insisted that because the 'period of transition' to socialism might be long, the army of the world proletariat, like the armies of antiquity, would have its 'bards', a role he was himself to play. His series of witness-novels, chronicling the tragedy of several generations of revolutionary militants, have been called \\"the closest thing to what the Soviet literature of the 1920s might have been\\" if it had not been repressed under Stalin.

He operated in the West and Central states, and his criminal exploits gained widespread press coverage in the 1930s. He was seen positively by the public because during robberies he burned mortgage documents freeing many people from their debts. He was pursued and killed by a group of Bureau of Investigation (BOI) agents led by Melvin Purvis. Historians have speculated as to which officers were at the event, but accounts document that local officers Robert \\"Pete\\" Pyle and George Curran were present at his fatal shooting and also at his embalming.Library of Congress, \\"End of the trail for desperado Floyd\\", Library of Congress, 22 October 1934 Floyd has continued to be a familiar figure in American popular culture, sometimes seen as notorious, other times portrayed as a tragic figure, even a victim of the hard times of the Great Depression in the United States. Early life Floyd was born in Bartow County, Georgia in 1904. His family moved to Akins, Oklahoma in 1911, and he grew up there. He was arrested at age 18 after he stole $3.50 from a local post office. Three years later, he was arrested for a payroll robbery on September 16, 1925 in St. Louis, Missouri and was sentenced to five years in prison. He served three and a half years before being granted parole. Floyd entered into partnerships with criminals in the Kansas City underworld after his parole. He committed a series of bank robberies over the next several years, and it was during this period that he acquired the nickname \\"Pretty Boy.\\" Orville Drake gave him the name because he would wear a white button-up dress shirt and slacks to work in the oil fields. The men on the rig began calling him \\"Pretty Boy\\" which was later turned into \\"Pretty Boy Floyd.\\" According to one account, a payroll master whom Floyd had robbed described him as \\"a pretty boy with apple cheeks.\\" Floyd despised the nickname. In 1929, Floyd was wanted in numerous cases. On March 9, he was arrested in Kansas City on investigation, and again on May 7 for vagrancy and suspicion of highway robbery, but he was released the next day. Two days later, he was arrested in Pueblo, Colorado and charged with vagrancy. He was fined $50.00 and sentenced to 60 days in jail. Floyd was arrested in Akron, Ohio on March 8, 1930 under the alias Frank Mitchell and charged with the murder of an Akron police officer who had been killed during a robbery that evening. He was arrested in Toledo, Ohio on suspicion on May 20. He was convicted of a Sylvania Ohio Bank Robbery and sentenced on November 24, 1930 to 12 to 15 years in Ohio State penitentiary, but he escaped. Floyd was a suspect in the deaths of Kansas City brothers Wally and Boll Ash who were rum-runners, found dead in a burning car on March 25, 1931. Members of his gang killed Patrolman R. H. Castner of Bowling Green, Ohio on April 23. On July 22, Floyd killed federal agent Curtis C. Burke in Kansas City, Missouri. Former sheriff Erv Kelley of McIntosh County, Oklahoma was shot by Floyd while trying to arrest him on April 7, 1932. In November, three members of Floyd's gang attempted to rob the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Boley, Oklahoma. Despite his life of crime, Floyd was viewed positively by the general public. When he robbed banks, he allegedly destroyed mortgage documents, but this has never been confirmed and may be myth. He was often protected by locals of Oklahoma who referred to him as \\"Robin Hood of the Cookson Hills\\".Charles \\"Pretty Boy\\" Floyd\\", Biography.com Kansas City massacre Floyd and Adam Richetti became the primary suspects in a gunfight known as the \\"Kansas City massacre\\" on June 17, 1933 which resulted in the deaths of four law enforcement officers. J. Edgar Hoover used the incident to empower the FBI to pursue Floyd, although historians are divided as to whether Floyd was involved. The gunfight was an attack by Vernon Miller and accomplices on lawmen escorting robber Frank \\"Jelly\\" Nash to a car parked at the Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City detective William Grooms, Kansas City patrolman Grant Schroder, Oklahoma police chief Otto Reed, and FBI special agent Ray Caffrey were killed. Nash was also killed while sitting in the car, shot in the head by his would-be rescuers. Two other Kansas City police officers survived by slumping forward in the back seat and feigning death. As the gunmen inspected the car, another officer responded from the station and fired at them, forcing them to flee. Miller was found dead on November 27, 1933 outside Detroit, Michigan, having been beaten and strangled. Floyd and Richetti were allegedly Miller's accomplices. Factors weighing against them included their apparent presence in Kansas City at the time, eyewitness identifications (which have been contested), Richetti's fingerprint recovered from a beer bottle at Miller's hideout, an underworld account naming Floyd and Richetti as the gunmen, and Hoover's firm advocacy of their guilt. Fellow bank robber Alvin Karpis claimed that Floyd confessed involvement. On the other side of the issue, the bandit alleged to have been Floyd was supposed to have been wounded by a gunshot to the shoulder in the attack, and Floyd's body showed no sign of this injury when examined later. The underworld account identifying Floyd and Richetti as the killers was offset by equally unreliable underworld accounts proclaiming their innocence. The Floyd family has maintained that Floyd admitted to many other crimes but vehemently denied involvement in this one, as did Richetti. Kansas City police received a postcard dated June 30, 1933 from Springfield, Missouri which read: \\"Dear Sirs - I - Charles Floyd - want it made known that I did not participate in the massacre of officers at Kansas City. Charles Floyd\\". The police department believed the note to be genuine. Floyd also reportedly denied involvement in the massacre to the FBI agents who had fatally wounded him. In addition, a recent book on the massacre attributes at least some of the killing to friendly fire by a lawman who was unfamiliar with his weapon, based on ballistic tests. Death The FBI named Floyd \\"Public Enemy No. 1\\" on July 23, 1934, following the death of John Dillinger. Local police and FBI agents led by Melvin Purvis shot Floyd on October 22, 1934 in a corn field in East Liverpool, Ohio. Accounts differ on who shot him and the manner in which he was killed. He and Richetti had left Buffalo, New York on October 18, and their vehicle slid into a telephone pole in heavy fog. No one was injured, but the car was disabled, so they sent two female companions to get a tow truck. They planned to have the women accompany the tow truck driver into town and have the vehicle repaired while they waited by the roadside. After dawn on October 19, motorist Joe Fryman and his son-in-law David O'Hanlon passed by, observing two men dressed in suits lying by the roadside. They thought it suspicious and informed Wellsville, Ohio police chief John H. Fultz. Fultz investigated with officers Grover Potts and William Erwin. Richetti saw the lawmen and fled into the woods, pursued by two officers, while Fultz went towards Floyd. Floyd immediately drew his gun and fired, and he and Fultz engaged one another in a gunfight, during which Fultz was wounded in the foot and Potts was wounded in the right shoulder, and Floyd then fled into the forest. The other two officers enlisted the help of local police officer Chester C. Smith (February 14, 1895 ‚Äì October 23, 1984), who had been a sniper during World War I, and they captured Richetti. Floyd remained on the run. At least three accounts exist of the following events, one given by the FBI, one by other people in the area, and one by local law enforcement. The accounts agree that Floyd hitched a ride in an East Liverpool neighborhood on October 22, 1934 after obtaining some food at a pool hall owned by his friend Charles Joy. He was spotted by the team of lawmen, at which point he broke from the vehicle and fled towards a tree line. Officer Chester Smith fired first, hitting Floyd in the right arm and knocking him to the ground. At this point, the three accounts diverge; the FBI agents claimed all the credit, denying that local law enforcement were even present at the shooting. According to the local police account, Floyd regained his footing and continued to run, at which point the entire team opened fire, knocking him to the ground. Floyd died from his wounds shortly after. According to the FBI, four FBI agents (Purvis, Samuel K. McKee, Jr., David E. Hall, and Winfred E. Hopton) led by Purvis and four members of the East Liverpool Police Department (McDermott, Herman H. Roth, Jr., Chester C. Smith, and Glenn G. Montgomery) led by Chief Hugh McDermott were searching the area south of Clarkson, Ohio in two cars. They spotted a car move from behind a corn crib and then move back. Floyd then emerged from the car and drew a .45 caliber pistol, and the FBI agents opened fire. Floyd reportedly said, \\"I'm done for. You've hit me twice.\\" Retired East Liverpool police captain Chester Smith described events differently in a 1979 issue of TIME magazine. He was credited with shooting Floyd first, and he stated that he had deliberately wounded Floyd but not killed him. \\"I knew Purvis couldn't hit him, so I dropped him with two shots from my .32 Winchester rifle.\\" According to Smith's account, Floyd fell and did not regain his footing, and Smith then disarmed him. At that point, Purvis ran up and ordered, \\"Back away from that man. I want to talk to him.\\" Purvis questioned Floyd briefly and received curses in reply, so he ordered agent Herman Hollis to \\"fire into him.\\" Hollis then shot Floyd at point-blank range with a sub- machine gun, killing him. The interviewer asked if there was a cover-up by the FBI, and Smith responded: \\"Sure was, because they didn't want it to get out that he'd been killed that way.\\" FBI agent Winfred E. Hopton disputed Smith's claim in a letter to the editors of TIME, published in the November 19, 1979 issue. He stated that he was one of four FBI agents present when Floyd was killed on a farm several miles from East Liverpool, Ohio. According to Hopton, members of the East Liverpool police department arrived only after Floyd was already mortally wounded. He also claimed that, when the four agents confronted Floyd, he turned to fire on them, and two of the four killed him almost instantly. Smith's account said that Herman Hollis shot the wounded Floyd on Purvis's order, but Hopton claimed that Hollis was not even present. Hopton also stated that Floyd's body was transported back to East Liverpool in Hopton's own car. Floyd's body was embalmed and briefly viewed at the Sturgis Funeral Home in East Liverpool, Ohio before being sent on to Oklahoma. His body was placed on public display in Sallisaw, Oklahoma. His funeral was attended by between 20,000 and 40,000 people and remains the largest funeral in Oklahoma history. He was buried in Akins, Oklahoma. Popular portrayals Video clips of Depression era gangsters, including Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson and Machine Gun Kelly Woody Guthrie wrote a protest song romanticizing Floyd's life in 1939 called \\"Pretty Boy Floyd\\" which recounted Floyd's supposed generosity to the poor. It satirically compared foreclosing bankers to outlaws. Guthrie's song has been subsequently covered by many recording artists. Dick Tracy's adversary Flattop Jones was based on Pretty Boy Floyd. Flattop claims to be a freelancer from the \\"Crookston Hills\\", a parody of Cookson Hills in Oklahoma, and the comic strip refers to Flattop's involvement in the Kansas City Massacre. Several movies have been made about Floyd: * John Ericson played him in Pretty Boy Floyd (1960), directed by Herbert J. Leder * Fabian Forte played him in A Bullet for Pretty Boy (1970) * Martin Sheen played him in the TV movie The Story of Pretty Boy Floyd (1974) * Bo Hopkins portrayed him in the TV movie The Kansas City Massacre (1975) * Channing Tatum portrayed him in Public Enemies (2009) starring Christian Bale and Johnny Depp, in which he is falsely depicted as being killed before John Dillinger Pretty Boy Floyd (1995) is a fictionalized account of Floyd's life by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana.

Reuben Clark Law School (BYU Law or JRCLS) is a professional school for the study of law in the western United States, located at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Founded in 1973, the school is named after J. Reuben Clark, a former U.S. Ambassador, Undersecretary of State, and general authority of the institution's sponsoring organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. BYU Law is fully accredited by the American Bar Association, and a member of the Association of American Law Schools. BYU Law consistently ranks among the nation's top tier of American Bar Association approved law schools according to U.S. News & World Report, and it is consistently recognized for its low tuition and high placement rate in Article III federal judicial clerkships.https://www.usnews.com/education/best- graduate-schools/top-law-schools/slideshows/10-law-schools-where-you-can-pay- off-your-debt?slide=8 History On March 9, 1971, the BYU Board of Trustees announced that a law school would be established at the Just two-and-one-half years later the opening ceremonies were held on Classes were initially held several blocks south in an old Catholic school building (St. Francis of Assisi, affectionately referred to as \\"St. Reuben's\\" by the students. Future U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee was the charter dean of the law school. The JRCLS Building was completed and dedicated in 1975, and the law school graduated its first class in 1976. The law school has since graduated more than 5,000 students. Campus The nearly BYU Law building is located on the east side of the campus of Brigham Young University and backdropped by Y Mountain. The building's five floors contain eleven classrooms, three seminar rooms, a student commons area, a student lunchroom, spaces for student organizations and activities, a large computer lab, and a computer training room. The Howard W. Hunter Law Library occupies the north wing of the law building and houses a collection of over 450,000 volumes and volume equivalents in paper and microform. The library provides its law students with 470 individually assigned study carrels, 17 group study rooms, a reading room for quiet study, and a popular reading and conversation room. The library also has two classrooms where library faculty teach legal research and writing classes, familiarizing students with specific types of legal research and with library holdings. In 2014, the National Jurist ranked the Howard W. Hunter Law Library as the 25th best law library in the country. The campus is located within the original jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Utah and the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).  Academics  =Admissions= Many admitted students have graduate and/or doctoral degrees in a wide range of academic disciplines, and most have spent time abroad.http://www.law2.byu.edu/admissions/pdf_documents/Profile%202008-2009.pdf Incoming Class Profile, BYU Law School Entering students graduated from over 70 different undergraduate colleges and universities in 11 countries and nearly 40 US states. In 2009, the incoming class had a median GPA of 3.73 and a median LSAT score of 165. Based on these numbers, BYU Law ranks 12th in the nation for GPA and 25th in the nation for LSAT admissions standards. Admission to the BYU Law School is open to people of any faith or sexual orientation, subject to the school's Honor Code. Among other things, the Honor Code precludes the admission and retention of students who are former members of the LDS Church, or whose actions are categorized as \\"homosexual behavior,\\" which includes both sexual relations and \\"all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings\\". To verify Honor Code compliance, students are required to obtain, and maintain during their course of study, an ecclesiastical endorsement from a religious leader or designated BYU chaplain. In 2016, the American Bar Association, which accredits the school, conducted a review to determine whether BYU Law School's admission and retention policy was in accordance with its nondiscrimination policy. =Degree programs= Juris Doctor (JD) program Most of the students at BYU Law are enrolled in the Juris Doctor (JD) program. JD students are required to take 90 semester hours of credit in order to graduate.

VXI stands for VME eXtensions for Instrumentation, defining additional bus lines for timing and triggering as well as mechanical requirements and standard protocols for configuration, message-based communication, multi-chassis extension, and other features. In 2004, the 2eVME extension was added to the VXI bus specification, giving it a maximum data rate of 160 MB/s. The basic building block of a VXI system is the mainframe or chassis. This contains up to 13 slots into which various modules (instruments) can be added. The mainframe also contains all the power supply requirements for the rack and the instruments it contains. Instruments in the form of VXI Modules then fit the slots in the rack. VXI bus modules are typically 6U in height (see Eurocard) and C-size (unlike VME bus modules which are more commonly B-size). It is therefore possible to configure a system to meet a particular requirement by selecting the required instruments. The basic architecture of the instrument system is described in US Patent 4,707,834. This Patent was freely licensed by Tektronix to the VXIbus Consortium.

To be eligible for membership, prospective members must be 18 years of age and over, show that they are committed to Rotaract, and show that they are of good standing in the community. After being approved by the club, prospective members are 'inducted' to become members, also known as 'Rotaractors'. The avenues of service include Club Service, Community Service, International Service and Professional Development. Rotaract Club undertake various projects for the overall development of their members. In 2019, Rotaract went from being a program of Rotary International to being a membership type of Rotary International, elevating its status to resemble that of Rotary clubs. As of 1 July 2020, Rotaract clubs can exist on their own, or may be sponsored by Rotary and/or Rotaract clubs. This makes them true \\"partners in service\\" and key members of the family of Rotary. A Rotaract club may, but is not required to, establish upper age limits, provided that the club (in accordance with its bylaws) obtain the concurrence of its members and the sponsor club(s) (if sponsored). In Hong KongÔºå there are 8 U-based universities joint to organize an annual camp for the committee members to participate. The camp is called Interflow.

Rotaract multidistrict information organizations (MDIOs) function as regional resource centers for Rotaractors. They comprise Rotaract clubs in two or more districts, within a country or across several countries. MDIOs are formed to disseminate information and facilitate communication among Rotaract clubs in the participating districts. Rotaract MDIOs are excellent ways for communicating program updates, local and international news, and event bulletins. They also facilitate uniting Rotaractors from different clubs and districts within a particular region. MDIOs offer information in the form of publications, online services, and direct links with Rotary International (RI) staff.

BS is caused by mutations in the BLM gene which is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family. Mutations in other members of this family, namely WRN and RECQL4, are associated with the clinical entities Werner syndrome and Rothmund‚ÄìThomson syndrome, respectively. More broadly, Bloom syndrome is a member of a class of clinical entities that are characterized by chromosomal instability, genomic instability, or both and by cancer predisposition. Cells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs). The condition was discovered and first described by New York dermatologist Dr. David Bloom in 1954. Bloom syndrome has also appeared in the older literature as Bloom‚ÄìTorre‚ÄìMachacek syndrome. Presentation The most prominent feature of Bloom syndrome is proportional small size. The small size is apparent in utero. At birth, neonates exhibit rostral to caudal lengths, head circumferences, and birth weights that are typically below the third percentile. The second most commonly noted feature is a rash on the face that develops early in life as a result of sun exposure. The facial rash appears most prominently on the cheeks, nose, and around the lips. It is described as erythematous, that is red and inflamed, and telangiectatic, that is characterized by dilated blood vessels at the skin's surface. The rash commonly also affects the backs of the hands and neck, and it can develop on any other sun-exposed areas of the skin. The rash is variably expressed, being present in a majority but not all persons with Bloom syndrome, and it is on average less severe in females than in males. Moreover, the sun sensitivity can resolve in adulthood. There are other dermatologic changes, including hypo-pigmented and hyper-pigmented areas, cafe-au-lait spots, and telangiectasias, which can appear on the face and on the ocular surface. There is a characteristic facial appearance that includes a long, narrow face; prominent nose, cheeks, and ears; and micrognathism or undersized jaw. The voice is high-pitched and squeaky. An individual with Bloom syndrome There are a variety of other features that are commonly associated with Bloom syndrome. There is a moderate immune deficiency, characterized by deficiency in certain immunoglobulin classes and a generalized proliferative defect of B and T cells. The immune deficiency is thought to be the cause of recurrent pneumonia and middle ear infections in persons with the syndrome. Infants can exhibit frequent gastrointestinal upsets, with reflux, vomiting, and diarrhea, and there is a remarkable lack in interest in food. There are endocrine disturbances, particularly abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism, insulin resistance, and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and compensated hypothyroidism. Persons with Bloom syndrome exhibit a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is reduced fertility, characterized by a failure in males to produce sperm (azoospermia) and premature cessation of menses (premature menopause) in females. Despite these reductions, several women with Bloom syndrome have had children, and there is a single report of a male with Bloom syndrome bearing children. Although some persons with Bloom syndrome can struggle in school with subjects that require abstract thought, there is no evidence that intellectual disability is more common in Bloom syndrome than in other people. The most serious and frequent complication of Bloom syndrome is cancer. In the 281 persons followed by the Bloom Syndrome Registry, 145 persons (51.6%) have been diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm, and there have been 227 malignancies. The types of cancer and the anatomic sites at which they develop resemble the cancers that affect persons in the general population. The age of diagnosis for these cancers is earlier than for the same cancer in normal persons. And many persons with Bloom syndrome have been diagnosed with multiple cancers. The average life span is approximately 27 years. The most common cause of death in Bloom syndrome is from cancer. Other complications of the disorder include chronic obstructive lung disease and type 2 diabetes, as noted above. There are a variety of excellent sources for more detailed clinical information about Bloom syndrome. There is a closely related entity that is now referred to as Bloom-syndrome-like disorder (BSLD) which is caused by mutations in components of the same protein complex to which the BLM gene product belongs, including TOP3A, which encodes the type I topoisomerase topoisomerase 3 alpha, RMI1, and RMI2. The features of BSLD include small size and dermatologic findings, such as cafe-au-lait spots, and the presence of the once pathognomic elevated SCEs is reported for persons with mutations in TOP3A and RMI1. Bloom syndrome shares some features with Fanconi anemia possibly because there is overlap in the function of the proteins mutated in this related disorder.  Genetics  Bloom syndrome metaphase cells exhibit frequent sister chromatid exchanges. Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by mutations in the maternally- and paternally-derived copies of the gene BLM. As in other autosomal recessive conditions, the parents of an individual with Bloom syndrome do not necessarily exhibit any features of the syndrome. The mutations in BLM associated with Bloom syndrome are nulls and missense mutations that are catalytically inactive. The cells from persons with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that is characterized by hyper-recombination and hyper-mutation. Human BLM cells are sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as UV and methyl methanesulfonate, indicating deficient repair capability. At the level of the chromosomes, the rate of sister chromatid exchange in Bloom's syndrome is approximately 10 fold higher than normal and quadriradial figures, which are the cytologic manifestations of crossing-over between homologous chromosome, are highly elevated. Other chromosome manifestations include chromatid breaks and gaps, telomere associations, and fragmented chromosomes. The hyper-recombination can also be detected by molecular assays The BLM gene is a member of the protein family referred to as RecQ helicases. The diffusion of BLM has been measured to 1.34 tfrac{mathrm{mu m}^2}{mathrm{s}} in nucleoplasm and 0.13 textstyle tfrac{mathrm{mu m}^2}{mathrm{s}} at nucleoli DNA helicases are enzymes that attach to DNA and temporarily unravel the double helix of the DNA molecule. DNA helicases function in DNA replication and DNA repair. BLM very likely functions in DNA replication, as cells from persons with Bloom syndrome exhibit multiple defects in DNA replication, and they are sensitive to agents that obstruct DNA replication. The BLM helicase is a member of a protein complex with topoisomerase III alpha, RMI1 and RMI2, also known as BTRR or the dissolvasome. Bloom-like phenotypes have been associated with mutations in topoisomerase III alpha, RMI1 and RMI2 genes. =Relationship to cancer and aging= As noted above, there is greatly elevated rate of mutation in Bloom syndrome and the genomic instability is associated with a high risk of cancer in affected individuals. The cancer predisposition is characterized by 1) broad spectrum, including leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas, 2) early age of onset relative to the same cancer in the general population, and 3) multiplicity, that is, synchronous or metachronous cancers. There is at least one person with Bloom syndrome who had five independent primary cancers. Persons with Bloom syndrome may develop cancer at any age. The average age of cancer diagnoses in the cohort is approximately 26 years old. Pathophysiology When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, the chromosomes are duplicated so that each new cell will get a complete set of chromosomes. The duplication process is called DNA replication. Errors made during DNA replication can lead to mutations. The BLM protein is important in maintaining the stability of the DNA during the replication process. Lack of BLM protein or protein activity leads to an increase in mutations; however, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BLM maintains stability of the chromosomes is still a very active area of research. Persons with Bloom syndrome have an enormous increase in exchange events between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids (the two DNA molecules that are produced by the DNA replication process); and there are increases in chromosome breakage and rearrangements compared to persons who do not have Bloom's syndrome. Direct connections between the molecular processes in which BLM operates and the chromosomes themselves are under investigation. The relationships between molecular defects in Bloom syndrome cells, the chromosome mutations that accumulate in somatic cells (the cells of the body), and the many clinical features seen in Bloom syndrome are also areas of intense research. Bloom syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Diagnosis Bloom syndrome is diagnosed using any of three tests - the presence of quadriradial (Qr, a four-armed chromatid interchange) in cultured blood lymphocytes, and/or the elevated levels of sister chromatid exchange in cells of any type, and/or the mutation in the BLM gene. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on February 19, 2015 that they have authorized marketing of a direct-to-consumer genetic test from 23andMe. The test is designed to identify healthy individuals who carry a gene that could cause Bloom Syndrome in their offspring. Treatment Bloom syndrome has no specific treatment; however, avoiding sun exposure and using sunscreens can help prevent some of the cutaneous changes associated with photo- sensitivity. Efforts to minimize exposure to other known environmental mutagens are also advisable.  Epidemiology  Bloom syndrome is an extremely rare disorder in most populations and the frequency of the disease has not been measured in most populations. However, the disorder is relatively more common amongst people of Central and Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish background. Approximately 1 in 48,000 Ashkenazi Jews are affected by Bloom syndrome, who account for about one-third of affected individuals worldwide. = Bloom's Syndrome Registry = The Bloom's Syndrome Registry lists 265 individuals reported as suffering from this rare disorder (as of 2009), collected from the time it was first recognized in 1954. The registry was developed as a surveillance mechanism to observe the effects of cancer in the patients, which has shown 122 individuals have been diagnosed with cancer. It also acts as a report to show current findings and data on all aspects of the disorder.

It is operated by the Manchester Transport Museum Society, a registered charity. In normal times, the tramway operates on Sunday afternoons between March and mid- November and on Saturday afternoons between May and mid-September. Operation may be suspended whilst major events are being held in the park, and is currently suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  History  Heaton Park was originally the private landscape park surrounding Heaton Hall, but was sold to Manchester City Council in 1902 for use as a municipal park. Shortly after the park was bought by the council, a branch of Manchester Corporation Tramways was built into the park from the existing tramway on Middleton Road. A large waiting shelter was constructed at the end of this branch, and the first tram arrived on 31 May 1903. By 1934 buses were taking over from trams and the stub tramway into the park was disconnected from the main system and covered in tarmac for use by buses. The Manchester Transport Museum Society (MTMS) was founded as a registered charity in the early 1960s, with the aim of the preservation of documents and artifacts relating to public transport in the Manchester region. An early project of the society was the restoration of Manchester Corporation Tramways 765, which had been found on a farm near Huddersfield. The restoration was carried out partly at the National Tramway Museum at Crich in Derbyshire, and partly at various borrowed workshops around Manchester, and once completed the car ran for a couple of seasons at Crich. However the MTMS had aspirations to operate the car in Manchester, and identified Heaton Park as a possible site. In the 1970s the society approached the city council with this idea. The initial plan, to construct a tramway from Grand Lodge to Heaton Hall, was considered too expensive, as it would require remedial works to carry it across the railway tunnel. A new scheme was proposed to open up the old Manchester Corporation Tramways spur from Middleton Road to the old tram shelter. The original track was buried under a layer of tarmac which was cleared and the tram shelter restored and modified to form a depot and museum. Work was completed in 1979 and the Heaton Park Tramway was officially opened on 28 March 1980. Since 1980, the museum tramway has been extended further into the park on three occasions, using track salvaged from elsewhere, and is now some long. The most recent extension was in 2011 and reaches the boathouse and lake. A new tram depot has been constructed at this terminus. Additionally, major restoration of the original depot and museum complex was completed in 2007.

The conversion of these routes to buses in 1930 led to most of these cars being sold, and the body of 765 was acquired by a farm near Huddersfield. In 1960 it passed to a group that was to become the Manchester Tramway Museum Society and restoration work started. It has operated at Heaton Park since 1979.Yearsley, Ian (1962) The Manchester Tram.

FD results in variable symptoms, including insensitivity to pain, inability to produce tears, poor growth and labile blood pressure (episodic hypertension and postural hypotension). People with FD have frequent vomiting crises, pneumonia, problems with speech and movement, difficulty swallowing, inappropriate perception of heat, pain and taste as well as unstable blood pressure and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Originally reported by Drs. Conrad Milton Riley (1913‚Äì2005) and Richard Lawrence Day (1905‚Äì1989) in 1949, FD is one example of a group of disorders known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN). All HSAN are characterized by widespread sensory dysfunction and variable autonomic dysfunction caused by incomplete development of sensory and autonomic neurons. The disorders are believed to be genetically distinct from each other. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of familial dysautonomia usually commence during infancy and worsen with age, and may include: gastrointestinal dysmotility (including erratic gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux, abnormal esophageal peristalsis, oropharyngeal incoordination), dysphagia (as poor suckling in infancy) and frequent choking/gagging, recurrent vomiting, poor weight gain/growth, delayed development (especially walking) and puberty (especially in girls), recurrent aspiration pneumonia (due to inhalation of food or vomitus) with possible secondary chronic lung disease, absence of overflow tears during crying, corneal ulcers, red skin blotches and excessive sweating (often during eating or excitement), breath-holding spells, slurred speech/nasal voice, tongue ulcers (from accidental self-injuries), hyporeflexia (variable absence of deep tendon reflexes), hypotonia, enuresis, arrhythmias, hypertension (including episodic hypertension in response to emotional stress or visceral pain), hypotension (including orthostatic hypertension with compensatory tachycardia (invariably present)), impaired (but not absent) temperature and pain perception (leading to frequent accidental injury), impaired proprioception, a smooth glossy tongue, scoliosis (with possibly secondary restrictive lung disease), abnormal gait, short stature, chronic renal failure (common), visual impairment, variable cognitive ability, characteristic facial features that develop with time, impaired vibration perception, lack of fungiform papilla of the tongue, and impaired taste perception (especially for sweetness). * Autonomic crises - In children with FD, recurrent episodes of vomiting may occur. Such episodes may be triggered by physical (e.g. infection) or emotional stress, may occur every 15‚Äì20 minutes for over 24 hours, and may be accompanied with: significant hypertension, drenching sweat, breathing issues, fever, tachycardia, aspiration pneumonia, skin blotches, drooling, and negative personality change. * Pain insensitivity - Insensitivity or indifference to painful stimuli may lead to frequent/progressive self- mutilation, burns, and ulcers. There may be self-mutilation of the tongue (especially in toddlers during teething), lips, and cheeks, or loss of teeth. Compulsive oral biting may result in ulcers, or tumour-like masses (Riga-Fede disease). = Progression = Familial dysautonomia presents with progressive age-specific symptoms. Though usually not diagnosed until several years of age, generalised signs of FD are present in during the newborn period >80% of those affected. Dysmorpnic facial features are not directly inherent to the disorder, however, facial asymmetry and a straightened mouth eventually develop due to abnormal tone and molding of facial bones.  Perinatal  A very high incidence of breech presentation has been noted among infants with FD. A lower birth weight as compared to siblings, premature birth, and intrauterine growth restriction have also been noted.  Neonatal  During the neonatal period, there may be hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, poor feeding with difficulty swallowing and aspiration, developmental delay, short stature, scoliosis, and corneal disease.  Infancy  Issues related to the disorder first appear during infancy. Early manifestations include hypotonia, feeding difficulty (impaired swallowing and suckling), poor growth, absence of tears, frequent lung infections, and poor body temperature control (infants may display cold hands and feet). Developmental milestones (e.g. walking, speech) may or may not be delayed. In infants with FD, a lack of overflow tears during emotional crying may be noted after the age of 7 months (until this age, overflow emotional tearing may also not occur in unaffected infants; overflow tearing is absent in neonates and begins to appear only after 2‚Äì3 months of age). Affected infants' hands may alternatively appear cool and mottled (from vasoconstriction), or red and swollen (from vasodilation). Red skin blotching is often precipitated by emotional excitement. In older infants and young children, breath-holding spells may occur, possibly leading to cyanosis or fainting. Breath-holding behaviour usually ceases by age 6.  Children  Kyphoscoliosis in a 10-year-old girl with HSANIIIBreath-holding behaviour usually resolves by age 6. In school-age children, there may be bed wetting, vomiting episodes, impaired pain and temperature perception, impaired blood pressure control (including orthostatic hypotension, an hypertension during periods of psychological excitement or vomiting), learning disabilities (e.g. short attention span; learning disabilities are present in about a third of those with FD, and may require special education), scoliosis, poor bone quality and bone fractures, and kidney and heart issues.  Adolescence and adulthood  Issues that tend to commence during adolescence or early adulthood include lung damage due to multiple respiratory infections, impaired kidney function, and impaired vision (due to atrophy of the optic nerve). By adulthood, there are often mounting difficulties with balance and unaided walking. Cause Familial dysautonomia is the result of mutations in IKBKAP gene on chromosome 9, which encodes for the IKAP protein (IkB kinase complex- associated protein). There have been three mutations in IKBKAP identified in individuals with FD. The most common FD-causing mutation occurs in intron 20 of the donor gene. Conversion of T‚ÜíC in intron 20 of the donor gene resulted in shift splicing that generates an IKAP transcript lacking exon 20. Translation of this mRNA results in a truncated protein lacking all of the amino acids encoded by exons 20‚Äì37. Another less common mutation is a G‚ÜíC conversion resulting in one amino acid mutation in 696, where Proline substitutes normal Arginine. The decreased amount of functional IKAP protein in cells causes familial dysautonomia. Diagnosis =Clinical diagnosis= Autosomal recessive inheritance A clinical diagnosis of FD is supported by a constellation of criteria: * No fungiform papillae on the tongue * Decreased deep tendon reflexes * Lack of an axon flare following intradermal histamine * No overflow tears with emotional crying =Genetic testing= Genetic testing is performed on a small sample of blood from the tested individual. The DNA is examined with a designed probe specific to the known mutations. The accuracy of the test is above 99%. Dr. Anat Blumenfeld of the Hadassah Medical center in Jerusalem identified chromosome number 9 as the responsible chromosome. =Prenatal testing= Familial dysautonomia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. If both parents are shown to be carriers by genetic testing, there is a 25% chance that the child will have FD. For pregnancies at increased risk for FD, preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis (at 15‚Äì17 weeks) or chorionic villus sampling (at 10‚Äì14 weeks) is possible. Management There is currently no cure for FD. There are only two treatment centers, one at New York University HospitalDysautonomia Treatment and Evaluation Center and one at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel.Sheba Medical Center One is being planned for the San Francisco area. Although the FD-causing gene has been identified and it seems to have tissue specific expression, there is no definitive treatment at present. A major issue has been aspiration pneumonia. Fundoplications (by preventing regurgitation) and gastrostomy tubes (to provide non-oral nutrition) have reduced the frequency of hospitalization. Other issues which can be treated include FD crises, scoliosis, and various eye conditions due to limited or no tears. Treatment of FD remains preventative, symptomatic and supportive. FD does not express itself in a consistent manner. The type and severity of symptoms displayed vary among patients and even at different ages on the same patients so patients should have specialized individual treatment plans. Medications are used to control vomiting, eye dryness, and abnormal blood pressure. Common management strategies include: artificial tears, appropriate feeding strategy (maintenance of adequate nutrition, avoidance of aspiration (thickened formula and different shaped nipples for infants)), daily chest physiotherapy (nebulization, bronchodilators, and postural drainage) for chronic pulmonary disease, pharmaceutical management of autonomic features (e.g. intravenous or rectal diazepam, or rectal chloral hydrate), preventing accidental injury, prevention of orthostatic hypotension (hydration, leg exercise, frequent small meals, a high-salt diet, and medication (e.g. with fludrocortisone)), treatment of orthopedic problems, compensating labile blood pressure. Parents and patients should be informed regarding daily eye care and early signs of corneal problems, as well as punctal cautery. Informing patients and caretakers has resulted in decreased corneal scarring and need for more aggressive surgical measures such as tarsorrhaphy, conjunctival flaps, and corneal transplants. Prognosis Average age of death is in the 3rd decade of life, however, affected persons may live into the 7th decade of life. Death occurs in 50% of the affected individuals by age 30. The outlook for patients with FD depends on the particular diagnostic category. Patients with chronic, progressive, generalized dysautonomia in the setting of central nervous system degeneration have a generally poor long-term prognosis. Death can occur from pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest in such patients. The survival rate and quality of life have increased since the mid-1980s mostly due to a greater understanding of the most dangerous symptoms. At present, FD patients can be expected to function independently if treatment is begun early and if major disabilities are avoided. Epidemiology Familial dysautonomia is seen almost exclusively in Ashkenazi Jews and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. The carrier frequency in Jewish individuals of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) ancestry is about 1/30, while the carrier frequency in non-Jewish individuals is unknown. If both parents are carriers, there is a one in four, or 25%, chance with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing is recommended for families who may be carriers of familial dysautonomia. Worldwide, there have been approximately 600 diagnoses recorded since discovery of the disease, with approximately 350 of them still living. Research In January 2001, researchers at Fordham University and Massachusetts General Hospital simultaneously reported finding the genetic mutation that causes FD, a discovery that opens the door to many diagnostic and treatment possibilities. Genetic screening subsequently became available in 2001, enabling Ashkenazi Jews to find out if they are carriers. Stem-cell therapy has been proposed as a potential future treatment. Eventually, treatment could be given in utero. Research into treatments is being funded by foundations organized and run by parents of those with FD. There is no governmental support beyond recognizing those diagnosed with FD as eligible for certain programs.Benefits for people with FD ‚Äì from Dysautonomia foundation See also * Dysautonomia * Medical genetics of Ashkenazi Jews References Further reading  Ashkenazi Jews topics Autosomal recessive disorders Peripheral nervous system disorders Neurocutaneous conditions Syndromes Rare diseases ","title":"Familial dysautonomia"},{"id":"1212553","text":"Pic la Selle (Krey√≤l: Pik Lasel), also called Morne La Selle, is the highest peak in Haiti with a height of above sea level.

They are the most common type of intraventricular cyst. The brain contains pockets or spaces called ventricles with a spongy layer of cells and blood vessels called the choroid plexus. This is in the middle of the fetal brain. The choroid plexus has the important function of producing cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid produced by the cells of the choroid plexus fills the ventricles and then flows around the brain and the spinal cord to provide a cushion of fluid around these structures. CPCs can form within this structure and come from fluid trapped within this spongy layer of cells, much like a soap bubble or a blister. CPCs are often called \\"soft signs\\" or fetal ultrasound \\"markers\\" because some studies have found a weak association between CPCs and fetal chromosome abnormalities. It is believed that many adults have one or more tiny CPCs. The fetal brain may create these cysts as a normal part of development. They are temporary and usually are gone by the 32nd week of pregnancy. CPCs are a rare cause of intermittent hydrocephalus. This is caused by a blockage of foramina within the ventricular drainage system of the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to expansion of the ventricles, compressing the brain (the cranial cavity cannot expand to accommodate the increase in fluid volume) and possibly causing damage. Chromosome problems Genetic counseling is often recommended to provide more information about fetal CPCs, to answer questions and concerns, and to outline available options such as amniocentesis or a blood test from the mother. There is a possible association between ultrasound-detected fetal CPCs and Trisomy 18. It is not correlated to the presence of Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Generally the risks are very low if there are no other risk factors. If no additional abnormalities are detected by a thorough \\"level II\\" ultrasound, the likelihood the fetus has trisomy 18 is very low. A meta- analysis of 8 studies between 1990 and 2000 with choroid plexus cysts that were identified in second-trimester (an incidence of 1.2%). The incidence of the cysts in women younger than 35 was 1% (n=1017). The study found no cases of trisomy 18 in fetuses with cysts whose mother was younger than 35. The study concluded that \\"there is no evidence that detection of isolated choroid plexus cyst in women who are <35 years of age increases the risk of trisomy 18\\". Other factors which may have a bearing on the baby's chances of developing chromosome problems include: * mother's age at the expected date of delivery * the results of serum screening; XAFP triple testing or quad screening * evidence of other \\"fetal findings\\" seen at the time of the ultrasound that may suggest a chromosome problem References Further reading  Central nervous system disorders ","title":"Choroid plexus cyst"},{"id":"1212580","text":"Golden key or Golden Key may refer to: * The English translation of the Latin phrase clavis aurea, used metaphorically in literature * Golden Key International Honour Society * Les Clefs d'Or (\\"The Golden Keys\\"), a professional association of hotel concierges * A device used to uncover the wall of riddles in Omegle Chat * An encryption backdoorForeign Affairs (2016), The Case Against a Golden Key * A song on the album Azure d'Or by Renaissance See also * The Golden Key (disambiguation) References ","title":"Golden key"},{"id":"1212583","text":"MEC may refer to: Businesses * MEC (media agency), a media agency network based in London and New York * Mediterranean Exploration Company, a restaurant in Portland, Oregon * Mongolia Energy Corporation, a mining company * Morgan Electro Ceramics, a ceramics manufacturing company * Mountain Equipment Co-op, a Canadian outdoors gear & clothing store * Myanmar Economic Corporation, a Burmese military-owned corporation Education * Manufacturing Engineering Centre, Cardiff University, United Kingdom * Master of Economics (M.Ec.), a postgraduate degree * Midland Empire Conference, a high school activity conference in Missouri, USA * Model Engineering College, Cochin, Kerala, India Politics * Member of the Executive Council, a member of the South African provincial government Transportation * Eloy Alfaro International Airport (IATA airport code), Manta, Ecuador * Maine Central Railroad (reporting mark), a former railroad in Maine, U.S. * Meols Cop railway station (National Rail code), Merseyside, England Other * Marginal efficiency of capital, an economics theory * Measured environmental concentration of a substance in an environmental sample * Mec, Poland * Media Expansion Card, a type of PCIe computer expansion card * Microbial electrolysis cell, a type of bioelectrochemical system * Ministry of Education (Brazil), the Brazilian education ministry * Mountain East Conference, a U.S. college athletic conference * Munitions and explosives of concern, unexploded ordnance * Multi- access edge computing, a network architecture concept * Motor Enthusiasts Club, motor club in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"MEC"},{"id":"1212595","text":"Fluoroscopic image of an aorta affected by Leriche's syndrome In medicine, aortoiliac occlusive disease, is a form of central artery disease involving the blockage of the abdominal aorta as it transitions into the common iliac arteries. Signs and symptoms Classically, it is described in male patients as a triad of the following signs and symptoms: #claudication of the buttocks and thighs #absent or decreased femoral pulses #erectile dysfunction This combination is known as Leriche syndrome. However, any number of symptoms may present, depending on the distribution and severity of the disease, such as muscle atrophy, slow wound healing in the legs, and critical limb ischemia. Diagnosis The physical examination usually shows weakened femoral pulses and a reduced ankle-brachial index. The diagnosis can be verified by color duplex scanning, which reveals either a peak systolic velocity ratio ‚â•2.5 at the site of stenosis and/or a monophasic waveform. MRA and multidetector CTA are often used to determine the extent and type of obstruction. Another technique is digital subtraction angiography which allows verification of the diagnosis and endovascular treatment in a single session. Angiography provides important information regarding the perfusion and patency of distal arteries (e.g. femoral artery). The presence of collateral arteries in the pelvic and groin area is important in maintaining crucial blood flow and lower limb viability. However, angiography should only be used if symptoms warrant surgical intervention.

This calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and could perform long multiplications and divisions effectively by using a movable accumulator for the result. Patented in France by Thomas de Colmar in 1820 and manufactured from 1851 to 1915, it became the first commercially successful mechanical calculator.Chase G.C.: History of Mechanical Computing Machinery, Vol. 2, Number 3, July 1980, page 204, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing https://archive.org/details/ChaseMechanicalComputingMachinery Its sturdy design gave it a strong reputation for reliability and accuracyIfrah G., The Universal History of Numbers, vol 3, page 127, The Harvill Press, 2000 and made it a key player in the move from to calculating machines that took place during the second half of the 19th century.Grier D.A.: When Computers Were Human, page 93, Princeton University Press, 2005 Its production debut of 1851 launched the mechanical calculator industry which ultimately built millions of machines well into the 1970s. For forty years, from 1851 to 1890,The Comptometer became the first competing design in production from 1887 but only one hundred machines were sold by 1890. the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator in commercial production, and it was sold all over the world. During the later part of that period two companies started manufacturing clones of the arithmometer: Burkhardt, from Germany, which started in 1878, and Layton of the UK, which started in 1883. Eventually about twenty European companies built clones of the arithmometer until the beginning of World War I. Evolution =Searching for a solution: 1820‚Äì1851= Detail of an arithmometer built before 1851. The one-digit multiplier cursor (ivory top) is the leftmost cursor The arithmometers of this period were four-operation machines; a multiplicand inscribed on the input sliders could be multiplied by a single-digit multiplier by simply pulling on a ribbon (quickly replaced by a crank handle). It was a complicated designScientific American, Volume 5, Number 1, page 92, September 22, 1849 and very few machines were built. Additionally, no machines were built between 1822 and 1844. This hiatus of 22 years coincides almost exactly with the period of time during which the British government financed the design of Charles Babbage's difference engine, which on paper was far more sophisticated than the arithmometer, but wasn‚Äôt finished at this time.The British Parliament financed this project from 1822 to 1842 (James Essinger, Jacquard's Web, pages 77 & 102‚Äì106, Oxford University Press, 2004). It is during this development that, from 1834 to 1836, Babbage conceived his analytical engine, a mechanical computer with Jacquard's cards to provide program and data to his machine, with a control/computing unit (mill), some memory (store) and various printers. In 1844 Thomas reintroduced his machine at the Exposition des Produits de l'Industrie Fran√ßaise in the newly created category of Miscellaneous measuring tools, counters and calculating machines but only received an honorable mention.(fr) Exposition des produits de l'industrie fran√ßaise en 1844. Rapport du jury central, Tome 2, page 504 Le Conservatoire num√©rique des Arts & M√©tiers He restarted the development of the machine in 1848. In 1850, as part of a marketing effort, Thomas built a few machines with exquisite Boulle marquetry boxes that he gave to the crown heads of Europe. He filed two patents and two patents of addition in between 1849 and 1851. =Creating an = One of the first machines with a unique serial number (10-digit machines with serial numbers from 500 to 549) built around 1863 The multiplier was removed, making the arithmometer a simple adding machine, but thanks to its moving carriage used as an indexed accumulator, it still allowed for easy multiplication and division under operator control. It was introduced in the UK at The Great Exhibition of 1851(fr) Exposition universelle de 1851, Tome III, seconde partie, Xe Jury, pp. 3‚Äì9 Even though there is no actual picture of the machine, the descriptions of the operations of multiplication and division correspond to the simplified machine (repeated operations at each indexes). In the introduction the writer mentions the old multiplying machines. and true industrial production started in 1851. Each machine was given a serial number and user manuals were printed. At first, Thomas differentiated machines by capacity and therefore gave the same serial number to machines of different capacities. This was corrected in 1863 and each machine was given its own unique serial number starting with a serial number of 500.This can be seen in this list of serial numbers www.arithmometre.org, accessed on 15 August 2012 The constant use of some of the machines exposed some minor design flaws like a weak carry mechanism, which was given an adequate fix in 1856, and an over rotation of the Leibniz cylinders when the crank handle is turned too fast, which was corrected by the addition of a Maltese cross.(fr) Bulletin de la soci√©t√© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale, 78e ann√©e. Troisi√®me s√©rie, tome VI. Ao√ªt 1879 pages 403‚Äì404 Le Conservatoire num√©rique des Arts & M√©tiers A patent covering all these innovations was filed in 1865. Because of its reliability and accuracy, government offices, banks, observatories and businesses all over the world started using the arithmometer in their day-to-day operations. Around 1872, for the first time in calculating machine history, the total number of machines manufactured passed the 1,000 mark. In 1880, twenty years before the competition, a mechanism to move the carriage automatically was patented and installed on some machines,(fr) Bulletin de la soci√©t√© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale, 78e ann√©e. Troisi√®me s√©rie, tome VI. Ao√ªt 1879 page 405 Le Conservatoire num√©rique des Arts & M√©tiers but was not integrated into the production models. =The golden age: 1887‚Äì1915= This arithmometer showcases almost one hundred years of improvements and is one of the last machines manufactured (1914). Under the management of Louis Payen, and later his widow, many improvements were introduced, such as an incline mechanism, a removable top, cursors and result windows that were easier to read, and a faster re-zeroing mechanism. Many clone makers appeared during that period, mostly in Germany and the United Kingdom. Eventually twenty independent companies manufactured clones of the arithmometer. All these companies were based in Europe but sold their machines worldwide. The fundamental design stayed the same; and after 50 years at the top, the arithmometer lost its supremacy in the mechanical calculator industry. While in 1890, the arithmometer was still the most produced mechanical calculator in the world, ten years later, by 1900, four machines, the comptometer and Burroughs' adding machineCortada, J: Before The Computer, page 34, Princeton University Press, 1993 in the USA, Odhner's ArithmometerTrogemann G.: Computing in Russia, page 43, GWV-Vieweg, 2001, in Russia, and Brunsviga in Germany had passed it in volume of machines manufactured. Production of the arithmometer stopped in 1915, during World War I. Alphonse Darras, who had bought the business in 1915, was unable to restart its manufacturing after the war because of the many shortages and a lack of qualified workers.(fr) La revue du bureau, p 340, 1921 Legacy Because it was the first mass-marketed and the first widely copied calculator, its design marks the starting point of the mechanical calculator industry, which evolved into the electronic calculator industry and which, through the accidental design of the first microprocessor to be commercialized, the Intel 4004, for one of Busicom's calculators in 1971, led to the first commercially available personal computer, the Altair in 1975. Its user interface was used throughout during the 120 years that the mechanical calculator industry lasted. First with its clones and then with the Odhner arithmometer and its clones, which was a redesign of the arithmometerTrogemann G.: Computing in Russia, page 41, GWV-Vieweg, 2001, with a pinwheel system but with exactly the same user interface. Over the years, the term arithmometer or parts of it have been used on many different machines like Odhner's arithmometer, the Arithmaurel or the Comptometer, and on some portable pocket calculating machines of the 1940s. Burroughs corporation started as the American Arithmometer Company in 1886. By the 1920s it had become a generic name for any machine based on its design with about twenty independent companies manufacturing Thomas' clones like Burkhardt, Layton, Saxonia, Gr√§ber, Peerless, Mercedes-Euklid, XxX, Archimedes, etc. History =Design= Thomas started to work on his machine in 1818 while serving in the French Army where he had to do a great deal of calculations. He made use of principles from previous mechanical calculators like the stepped reckoner of Leibniz and Pascal's calculator. He patented it on November 18, 1820. This machine implemented a true multiplication where, by just pulling on a ribbon, the multiplicand entered on the input sliders was multiplied by a one-digit multiplier number and it used the method for subtracting. Both of these features would be dropped in later designs. =First machine= The first machine was built by Devrine, a Parisian clockmaker, and took him a year to build. But, in order to make it work, he had to modify the patented design quite substantially. The Soci√©t√© d‚Äôencouragement pour l‚Äôindustrie nationale was given this machine for review and it issued a very positive report on December 26, 1821.Bulletin de la soci√©t√© d‚Äôencouragement pour l‚Äôindustrie nationale, Feb 1822, page 36, scanned by www.arithmometre.org The only known prototype of this time is the on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. =Production= Some of the logos used over the years Manufacturing started in 1851 and ended around 1915. There were about machines built during this sixty-year period; 40% of the production was sold in France and the rest was exported.Martin, E: The Calculating Machines, page 54, Charles Babbage Institute, 1992 The manufacturing was managed by: * Thomas de Colmar himself until his death in 1870, then by his son Thomas de Bojano until 1881 and by his grandson Mr. de Rancy until 1887. Misters Devrine (1820), Piolaine (1848), Hoart (1850) and Louis Payen (around 1875) were the engineers responsible for building the machines. All the machines manufactured during this time have the logo . * Louis Payen who bought the business in 1887 until his death in 1902; all these machines have the logo . * Veuve (widow) L. Payen who took over the business at her husband's death and sold it in 1915 with the logos , and VLP. Alphonse Darras built most of these machines. * Alphonse Darras who bought the business in 1915 and manufactured the last machines. He added a logo made of the letters A and D interlaced and went back to the logo. During the early part of manufacturing, Thomas differentiated machines by capacity and therefore gave the same serial number to machines of different capacities. He corrected this in 1863, giving every machine its own unique serial number starting with a serial number of 500. This is why there isn't any machine with a serial number in between 200 and 500. From 1863 to 1907 the serial numbers were consecutive (from 500 to 4000) then, after patenting a rapid zeroing mechanism in 1907, Veuve L. Payen started a new numbering scheme at 500 (the number of arithmometers she had built with the old scheme) and was at serial number 1700 when she sold the business to Alphonse Darras in 1915. Alphonse Darras went back to the old serial numbers (while adding approximately the number of machines made by Veuve L. Payen) and restarted at 5500. Desktop Mechanical Calculators in production during the 19th century =Ease of use and speed= An article published in January 1857 in The Gentleman's Magazine best describes it: =Models= 20 digits arithmometer built around 1875 The various models had capacities of 10, 12, 16 and 20 digits which gave results ranging from to . Only two machines were built outside this range: *The first prototype (the 1822 machine) had a capacity of 6 digits even though the machine described in the 1820 patent is an 8 digits machine. *The piano arithmometer with a capacity of 30 digits, allowing for numbers up to 1 nonillion , which was built for the 1855 Exposition universelle de Paris and which is now part of the IBM collection of mechanical calculators.Piano arithmometer IBM Collection of mechanical calculators Jules Verne must have been quite impressed by this machine because in his novel Paris in the Twentieth Century, after mentioning Pascal and Thomas de Colmar, he talks of mechanical calculators that will be some huge pianos with keyboards of keys that will deliver answers instantaneously to anyone that can play them!(fr) Jules Verne, Paris au XXe si√®cle, page 68, Hachette, 1994 The last 10-digit arithmometers were built in 1863 with the serial numbers 500‚Äì549. After this the smallest machines were 12-digit machines. All the machines, regardless of capacity, were about 7 inches (18 cm) wide and from 4 up to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) tall (the tallest ones had an incline mechanism). A 20-digit machine was 2 ft 4 in (70 cm) long while the length a 10-digit machine was around 1 ft 6 in (45 cm). =Prices= A 12-digit arithmometer sold for 300 francs in 1853, which was 30 times the price of a table of logarithms book and 1,500 times the cost of a first-class stamp (20 French cents), but, unlike a table of logarithms book, it was simple enough to be used for hours by an operator without any special qualifications.(fr) Annales de la Soci√©t√© d'√©mulation du d√©partement des Vosges, 1853 Gallica web site An advertisement taken from a magazine published in 1855 shows that a 10-digit machine sold for 250 francs and a 16-digit machine sold for 500 francs.(fr) Cosmos July 1855 www.arithmometre.org.

Physical design The arithmometer is a brass instrument housed in a wooden box often made of oak or mahogany and for the oldest ones ebony (solid or veneer). The instrument itself is divided into two parts. Front panel of a Thomas arithmometer with its movable result carriage extended =Input ‚Äì control ‚Äì execution= The bottom part is composed of a set of sliders that are used to input the value of the operands. On the left of it is a control lever which allows to select the current operation, namely Addition/Multiplication or Subtraction/Division. A crank located on the right of the sliders is used to execute the operation selected by the control lever. =Output ‚Äì accumulator= The top part is a movable carriage composed of two display registers and two reset buttons. The top display register holds the result of the previous operation and acts as accumulator for the current operation. Each command adds or subtracts the number inscribed on the sliders to the part of the accumulator directly above it. The lower display register counts the number of operations performed at each index therefore it displays the multiplier at the end of a multiplication and the quotient at the end of a division. Each number in the accumulator can be individually set with a knob situated right below it. This feature is optional for the operation counter register. The accumulator and the result counter are in between two buttons used to reset their content at once. The left button resets the accumulator, the right button resets the operation counter. These buttons are also used as handles when lifting and sliding the carriage. =Arithmometer's Leibniz wheel= In the position shown, the counting wheel meshes with 3 of the 9 Leibniz wheel's teeth and therefore 3 is added to the attached counter for each and every full rotation. The animation on the side shows a nine-toothed Leibniz wheel coupled to a red counting wheel. The counting wheel is positioned to mesh with three teeth at each rotation and therefore would add or subtract 3 from the counter at each rotation. The computing engine of an arithmometer has a set of linked Leibniz wheels coupled to a crank handle. Each turn of the crank handle rotates all the Leibniz wheels by one full turn. The input sliders move counting wheels up and down the Leibniz wheels, which are themselves linked by a carry mechanism. In the arithmometer the Leibniz wheels always turn the same way. The difference in between addition and subtraction is achieved by a reverser operated by the execution lever and located in the movable display carriage. Operations =Sliding the top carriage= First lift the carriage using the reset buttons located at its extremities, then slide it. The carriage can only be moved to the right initially. Release it when it is above the index you want (ones, tens, hundreds, ...). =Resetting the displays= First lift the carriage using the reset buttons located at its extremities, then turn them to reset the display registers. The left button resets the accumulator, the right button resets the operation counter. =Addition= Set the control lever to Addition/Multiplication and reset the display registers. Each turn of the execution lever adds the number from the sliders to the accumulator. So input the first number and turn the lever once (it adds it to zero) then enter the second number and turn the lever once more. =Multiplication= Set the control lever to Addition/Multiplication and reset the display registers. To multiply 921 by 328, first input 921 on the input sliders and then turn the execution lever 8 times. The accumulator shows and the operation counter shows 8. Now, shift the carriage to the right once and turn the lever 2 times, the accumulator shows and the operation counter shows 28. Shift the carriage one last time to the right and turn the lever 3 times, the product appears on the accumulator and the operation counter displays the multiplier 328. =Subtraction= Set the control lever to Subtraction/Division. Lift the carriage then reset the display registers and input the minuend, right justified, into the accumulator using the corresponding knobs. Lower the carriage to its default position and then set the subtrahend onto the input sliders and turn the execution lever once. =Integer division= Set the control lever to Subtraction/Division and set the divisor onto the input sliders. While keeping the carriage lifted, reset the display registers, set the dividend, right justified, using the corresponding knobs and shift the carriage so that the highest number in the dividend corresponds to the highest number in the divisor. Lower the carriage then turn the execution lever as many times as required until the number situated above the divisor is less than the divisor, then shift the carriage once to the left and repeat this operation until the carriage is back to its default position and the number in the accumulator is less than the divisor, then the quotient will be in the operations counter and the remainder will be what is left over in the accumulator. =Decimal division= In order to increase the decimal division accuracy add as many zeros as required to the right of the dividend but still input it right justified and then proceed as with an integer division. It is important to know where the decimal point is, when you read the quotient (some markers, first ivory and then metal, were usually sold with the machine and used for this purpose). Variants In 1885, Joseph Edmondson of Halifax, UK, patented his 'Circular Calculator' ‚Äì essentially a 20-digit arithmometer with a circular carriage (the slides being arranged radially around it) instead of the straight sliding carriage. One benefit of this was that the carriage always remained within the footprint (to use a modern term) of the machine instead of overhanging the case at one side when the higher decimal places were in use. Another was that one could make a calculation of up to ten places, using half the circumference of the carriage, and then turn the carriage through 180¬∞; the result of the calculation was locked in place by means of brass prongs mounted on the framework, and one could leave it there while making an entirely new calculation using the fresh set of display windows now brought into alignment with the sliders. Thus the machine could be said to have a rudimentary memory. See the Rechenmaschinen- Illustrated website (External links below) for pictures and a description.

Retrieved on June 6, 2010. The chain was owned by Real Mex Restaurants, Inc. until its August 7, 2018 bankruptcy and acquisition by Z Capital and Tennenbaum Capital Partners. History A Chevys Fresh Mex restaurant in April 2001. The chain was founded in 1981 by Warren Simmons, when he opened the first restaurant in Alameda, California. It grew to 37 restaurants across California by August 1993, when it was acquired by PepsiCo subsidiary Taco Bell. When PepsiCo decided to exit the restaurant business in 1997, Chevys was sold to the investment group J.W. Childs Associates. In 1999, Chevys purchased Rio Bravo Cantina, a poorly performing chain of Tex-Mex restaurants with 66 locations across the United States, from Applebee's International for $59 million. However, business was poor at the Rio Bravo locations, and in 2003 Chevys' executives filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. For the next year and a half, Chevys operated as debtor in possession under Chapter Eleven. In January 2005, Chevys and Fuzio Universal Pasta were acquired by Real Mex Restaurants, Inc., the Long Beach, California-based parent company of El Torito Restaurants and Acapulco Mexican Restaurants. The acquisitions gave Real Mex Restaurants claim as the largest operator of full-service Mexican restaurants in the United States. Real Mex subsequently passed through bankruptcy in 2011‚Äì2012, and finally in 2018 when Real Mex was rebranded as Xperience XRG. 14 more underperforming Chevys Fresh Mex restaurants, mostly in northern California, were closed on December 26, 2016. Among these were the Redding, Chico, South Lake Tahoe, Modesto, and Fresno locations in California. Restaurants As of March 2017, there were 37 Chevys Fresh Mex restaurants located throughout the United States, mostly in northern California (15 locations). Many of these locations are owned by the company; however, some are franchisee-owned. Franchised Chevys locations, a handful of restaurants in California, and a single unit in Orlando, Florida remain after the October, 2018 bankruptcy and asset sale.

It consists of a perfect circle measuring 38 feet (11.5m) of 600 postmolds that contain 24 holes or basins cut into the limestone bedrock, on a coastal spit of land, surrounded by a large number of other 'minor' holes. It is the only known evidence of a prehistoric permanent structure cut into the bedrock in the Eastern United States, and considerably predates other known permanent settlements on the East Coast. It is believed to have been the location of a structure, built by the Tequesta (also Tekesta) Indians, in what was possibly their capital. Discovered in 1998, the site is believed to be somewhere between 1,700 and 2,000 years old. Some scholars have questioned both its age and its authenticity. HistoryMiami, then known as the Historical Museum of Southern Florida, signed a 44-year lease of the site in March 2008, with plans to offer tours beginning in Spring 2009. On February 5, 2002, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was declared a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009. On February 3, 2014, the Miami Herald reported additional postholes had been excavated in Downtown Miami, further indicating presence of ancient habitation. Discovery The site of 401 Brickell Avenue, named after William Brickell, co-founder of Miami in the 1870s, held an apartment complex until 1998. Property developer Michael Baumann purchased the site for $8.5 million to build a luxury condominium, and in July 1998 tore down the standing apartment complex. According to City of Miami historic preservation code requirements, he was obliged to commission a routine archaeological field survey of the site prior to commencement of building, but this didn't occur until Bob Carr, then Director of the Miami- Dade County Historic Preservation Division, pressed the issue with the City and Baumann. John Ricisak of the Miami-Dade Historic Preservation Division, along with a host of volunteers and employees of the Archaeological & Historical Conservancy, conducted the salvage excavation of the site with oversight by Bob Carr.The Seminole consider themselves the ancestors of the Tequesta who built the circle. In the course of the exploration, the team discovered a number of holes cut into the Oolitic limestone bedrock. On examining the layout of the holes, the surveyor Ted Riggs postulated that they were part of a circle in diameter. Having calculated the center, he projected the likely location of the remaining holes. Excavation revealed that there were 24 holes forming a perfect circle in the limestone. Examination of the earth revealed numerous archeological artifacts, ranging from shell-tools and stone axe-heads to human teeth and charcoal from fires. Controversy and resolution The developer Baumann, keen to continue construction of his condominium, offered to pay to relocate the circle to another site for preservation, an idea that Mayor Joe Carollo supported. But public opposition grew, with groups ranging from archaeologists and Native Americans to New Agers and schoolchildren protesting that the removal could potentially destroy one of the most archaeologically significant finds in North America. The Elizabeth Ordway Dunn Foundation made a donation of $25,000 to fund further exploration of the site, which continued until February 1999. Following issuance of building permits by the City of Miami during the last week of January 1999, the Dade Heritage Trust (Miami-Dade County's largest historic preservation organization) filed a lawsuit on January 31, 1999, seeking an injunction against further construction on site. Trust pro-bono attorney Gary Held, who filed the suit, arranged for an emergency hearing at the home of Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wilson. The basis for the lawsuit was that the developer had not obtained required approval in the form of a certificate of appropriateness from the City of Miami's Historic and Environmental Preservation Board. At the hearing, the developer and the City were represented by counsel. Following arguments and Dade Heritage Trust's admission that it was not prepared to post a bond to support the injunction request, the Judge denied the motion for temporary injunction. But, Baumann agreed to postpone construction on the site for thirty days while the archaeologists finished their work.Cass, D: \\"Vicious Circle,\\" Metropolis, 108, 113, November 1999. Meanwhile, a plan to move the Circle was proposed. Joshua Billig, stonemason of Rockers Stone and Supply, was to carry out the relocation. He quit on February 14, 1999, having become convinced the circle should not be moved. Using the 30-day delay in construction which Baumann agreed to, County Mayor for Miami-Dade Alex Penelas and others interested in saving the Circle, asked the County Commission to file a lawsuit to take ownership of the property. The Commission approved such action on 18 February, and Judge Richard Feder ordered a temporary injunction against building on the site. Baumann agreed to sell, but asked for $50 million, a price which he eventually lowered to $26.7 million. Baumann made a profit of 18.2 million minus the costs. In an unprecedented move, the State of Florida Preservation 2000 land acquisition program purchased the site from Baumann for that sum in November 1999, using both state funds and donations from various foundations and private citizens. The \\"Brickell Point Site\\" was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 5, 2002. Archaeology The circle, April 2011 Artifacts recovered from the Miami Circle site are stored and on display at HistoryMiami. It is the official repository for all archaeological materials recovered in Miami-Dade County. =Age= In order to date the site, pieces of burnt wood were sent in March 1999 for radiocarbon dating by John Ricisak, a specialist in the County Historic Preservation department. The results were a surprise, indicating that the wood was between 1,800‚Äì2,000 years old. Some scholars doubt that the circle is as old as the wood. Further evidence to support the theory that the holes were of that age comes from Tom Scott and Harvey Means of the Florida Geological Survey, who point to the buildup of a calcite \\"duricrust\\" on the edge of the cut face. Though this is an extremely imprecise way to date the holes, it rules out that they were of modern origin. =Origin= Initial theories on the origin of the site were that it was created by the Olmec or Mayan civilizations. This theory was based on the fact there is little evidence of indigenous peoples in North America building permanent structures 2,000 years ago. No evidence was found of any artifacts of Central American origin, however. Further examination of the artifacts found at the site, particularly the shell tools, shark teeth, and other items of aquatic origin, showed that they matched perfectly with artifacts known to be from a local tribe, the historic Tequesta. The Tequesta were a tribe who were believed to be primarily nomadic, hunting fish and alligators in the Florida Everglades. They were considered aggressive as they killed many early European explorers who attempted landfall in Florida. The Tequesta, like many other Native Americans, succumbed to the new infectious diseases brought by European colonists, as well as were disrupted by warfare. =Purpose= Randolph Widmer of the University of Houston suggested holes were postholes for some kind of structure, probably a cone-shaped building with a hole in the top. These sorts of structures were known to have existed in the Eastern United States, yet none was thought to have had such a permanent base as the Miami Circle. Critics of this theory pointed out that there was no evidence of fire on the bedrock as is usually found in the remains of this type of buildings. Widmer's response was that, given the weather common across Florida and resulting flooding, the early people may have raised the structure on stilts. This theory also suggested that the seemingly random array of holes could have been for support posts. They appear in clusters perhaps due to the necessity to replace them as the wood rotted. Researchers next tried to determine the purpose of the structure. Two obvious candidates are living quarters, or a ceremonial building of some sort. The lack of evidence for the former began to suggest the latter, and further evidence can be put forward to support the theory. Firstly the effort necessary to create such a structure would involve considerable teamwork, particularly given the lack of tools. This sort of teamwork is often seen in the construction of religious buildings. Secondly, there were certain anomalies in the artifacts discovered. Many 'common' Tequesta relics were found at the site‚Äîtools and perhaps decorative items made from shells and other aquatic materials like sharks' teeth‚Äîbut there were a few pieces discovered that did not fit. The main items were two basalt axe heads. These axes would have been a particularly sought after item on the southern Florida coast due to the lack of any equivalent hard stone in the area, yet these axe heads are completely untouched. Further analysis of the stone by Dr. Jacqueline Dixon, University of Miami, found that the basalt was likely from the region of Macon, Georgia, some away. Additional items that may have been placed in, or buried under the structure were a complete long shark skeleton, aligned east to west, a dolphin skull, and a complete carapace of a sea- turtle. Four human teeth were also found, though no other evidence pointed to its being a burial site. Septic tank controversy University of Florida archaeologist Jerald Milanich was concerned that there was, from the previous apartment block, a septic tank that was aligned perfectly at the edge of the circle. He suggested that the circle could be nothing more than a sink for the sewage from the septic tank, an idea that understandably drew a certain amount of interest. In attempting to refute this claim, Ricicek pointed to two things. Firstly there was clearly a terracotta outflow from the tank that would not tie with the need for a sink, and the plans for the apartment complex clearly show a sewage outflow to the south, into the river. Secondly, returning to the analysis of the calcite buildup on the holes by the Florida Geological Survey, the bedrock that had been cut out to lay the tank had little or no duricrust, showing the considerable age difference between the septic tank construction and the Circle.

In oceanography, sea state is the general condition of the free surface on a large body of water‚Äîwith respect to wind waves and swell‚Äîat a certain location and moment. A sea state is characterized by statistics, including the wave height, period, and power spectrum. The sea state varies with time, as the wind conditions or swell conditions change. The sea state can either be assessed by an experienced observer, like a trained mariner, or through instruments like weather buoys, wave radar or remote sensing satellites. In case of buoy measurements, the statistics are determined for a time interval in which the sea state can be considered to be constant. This duration has to be much longer than the individual wave period, but smaller than the period in which the wind and swell conditions vary significantly. Typically, records of one hundred to one thousand wave-periods are used to determine the wave statistics. The large number of variables involved in creating the sea state cannot be quickly and easily summarized, so simpler scales are used to give an approximate but concise description of conditions for reporting in a ship's log or similar record. 0. None / Low 1. Short or average 2. Long / Moderate (The latter model has since its creation improved based on the work of Phillips and Kitaigorodskii to better model the wave height spectrum for high wavenumbers.) An example function f(Theta) might be: : f(Theta) = frac{2}{pi}cos^2Theta, qquad -pi/2 le Theta le pi/2 Thus the sea state is fully determined and can be recreated by the following function where zeta is the wave elevation, epsilon_{j} is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2pi, and Theta_j is randomly drawn from the directional distribution function sqrt{f(Theta)}: : zeta = sum_{j=1}^N sqrt{2 S(omega_j) Delta omega_j}; sin(omega_j t - k_j x cos Theta_j - k_j y sin Theta_j + epsilon_{j}). In addition to the short term wave statistics presented above, long term sea state statistics are often given as a joint frequency table of the significant wave height and the mean wave period. From the long and short term statistical distributions it is possible to find the extreme values expected in the operating life of a ship. A ship designer can find the most extreme sea states (extreme values of H1/3 and T1) from the joint frequency table, and from the wave spectrum the designer can find the most likely highest wave elevation in the most extreme sea states and predict the most likely highest loads on individual parts of the ship from the response amplitude operators of the ship. Surviving the once in 100 years or once in 1000 years sea state is a normal demand for design of ships and offshore structures.

Mostly mild grey in colour with some lighter scalloping (more pronounced and buffy in females), the male has a red head and crest, while the female has a small fluffy grey crest. It ranges throughout south-eastern Australia. The gang-gang cockatoo is the faunal emblem of the Australian Capital Territory. It is easily identified by its distinctive call, which is described as resembling a creaky gate, or the sound of a cork being pulled from a wine bottle. The name gang-gang comes from a New South Wales Aboriginal language, probably from one of the coastal languages, although possibly from Wiradjuri. It is probably an onomatopoeic name.  Description  The gang-gang cockatoo is a grey bird with a wispy crest. The head and crest is bright red in males, but dark grey in females. The edges of feathers in underparts have edges of yellow or pink. The edges of feathers on upperarts are slightly paler grey than the rest of the feather, which makes the bird look somewhat barred. Juvenile males can be distinguished by their brighter crowns and shorter crests, but otherwise look similar to the adult female. The birds are not easily mistaken for other cockatoos, but while in flight may resemble the Galah. Gang-gangs are very social birds, but not overly noisy. Taxonomy and systematics The gang-gang cockatoo was most often allied with the white cockatoos of the genus Cacatua. This has always been controversial due to the unusual appearance and coloration of the bird, especially its sexual dichromatism. New research has finally resolved the matter, with the gang-gang cockatoo being recognized as a distinctive early offshoot of the calyptorhynchine (dark) cockatoos. Considering the robust phylogeny of the cockatoos now established, a comparison of characteristics gained and lost during the evolution of cockatoos suggests that the gang-gang cockatoo‚Äîwhile of course much changed and adapted during the perhaps 20 million years since its last common ancestor with any other living species lived‚Äîis probably still very similar in overall appearance to how the earliest cockatoos would have looked, and certainly the most primitive-looking of the species alive today.  Distribution and habitat  The gang-gang is endemic to coastal regions of south-eastern Australia. They used to inhabit King Island off of Tasmania, but they have since gone extinct locally. They are an introduced species on Kangaroo Island. The gang-gang prefers forests and woodlands in the mountains with dense shrub understories. The birds migrate short distances during winter into more open habitats. However they must migrate back to denser forests to breed, as they need tall trees in order to build nests.  Ecology  =Breeding= Unlike most other cockatoos, gang-gangs nest in young, solid trees, the females using their strong beaks to excavate nesting cavities. Also, they breed in the canopy of most trees. Status Loss of older, hollow trees and loss of feeding habitat across south-eastern Australia through land clearing has led to a significant reduction in the numbers of this cockatoo in recent years. As a result, the gang-gang is now listed as vulnerable in New South Wales. It is protected as a vulnerable species under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW).Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW), Schedule 1: Part 3 Vulnerable species This protection status as a threatened species makes it a Tier 1 criminal offence for a person or corporation to knowingly damage the bird's habitat.Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW), s.2.4 Damage is defined to include \\"damage caused by removing any part of the habitat\\".Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW), s.1.6 Habitat is defined to include \\"an area periodically or occasionally occupied by a species\\".Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW), s.1.6 Gallery File:Female_Gang_Gang_Cockatoo.jpgA female gang-gang cockatoo eating peppercorns File:Gang-gang female MJC01.jpgFemale File:Callocephalon fimbriatum (male) -Blue Mountains-8.jpgMale in the Blue Mountains File:Gang- Gang-male444.jpgMale eating Acacia baileyana seeds Callocephalon fimbriatum (pair) -NSW -Australia-8.jpgTwo immature birds at New Buildings, NSW, Australia: The male is on the left and the female on the right.

Todd and 3 small Spanish vessels under Mariano Mateu. The battle resulted in an unusually costly American reverse that dissuaded the U.S. Navy from undertaking further attacks on the port. Background In May 1898, a small squadron of the United States Navy, consisting of the torpedo boats and , the gunboats and , and the U.S. Revenue Cutter Hudson, was operating off the northern coast of Cuba. On May 11, 1898, this fleet entered the Bay of C√°rdenas to destroy the three small Spanish gunboats reportedly moored in the harbor. Having swept the area for mines, Captain Todd ordered the Winslow to approach the shore and investigate a steamer moored alongside the wharf to determine whether the vessel was an enemy warship. The Spanish squadron based on C√°rdenas consisted of three ships: Ligera, Alerta and Antonio L√≥pez, under the command of Teniente de Nav√≠o Mariano Mateu. The 42-ton Ligera, which had driven off Foote two weeks earlier in a fortuitous encounter off the harbour's mouth, was under Lieutenant Antonio P√©rez Rend√≥n, while Alerta, of the same tonnage, was under Lieutenant Pasqu√≠n. Both gunboats mounted a cannon of 42 mm and a Maxim of 37 mm. Antonio L√≥pez was a small tug armed with a Nordenfelt gun, and under the command of Lieutenant Domingo Montes Reguefeiros. The Spanish Line had transferred the Antonio Lopez to the navy some years before. Battle USS Winslows conning tower, damaged from Spanish gunfire during the battle By 13:35, Winslow reached a point approximately 1,500 yards from her quarry when a white puff of smoke from Antonio L√≥pez's bow gun signaled the beginning of an artillery duel which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. Winslow responded with her 1-pounders. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on Winslow, and she soon received several direct hits. The first shot to score on the torpedo boat destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Her crew tried to rig an auxiliary steering system, but she swung broadside to the enemy and a shot pierced her hull near the engine room and knocked the port main engine out of commission. She maneuvered with her remaining engine to evade enemy fire and maintained a steady return fire with her 1-pounders. Wilmington and Hudson brought their guns to bear on the Spanish ship and shore, and the combined fire of the three American warships put the Spanish tugboat out of action while several waterfront buildings caught fire. All but disabled, Winslow requested Hudson to tow her out of action. The revenue cutter approached the stricken torpedo boat and rigged a tow line between the two ships. As Hudson began to tow Winslow out to sea, one of the last Spanish shells to strike the torpedo boat hit her near the starboard gun and killed Ensign Worth Bagley who had been helping to direct the warship's maneuvers by carrying instructions from the deck to the base of the engine room ladder. Ensign Bagley became known as the first U.S. naval officer killed in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, killed along with four other sailors, John Barberes, John Daniels, George B. Meek and E.B. Tunnell.Nofi, A.A., 1996, The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898, Pennsylvania: Combined Books, Aftermath Badly damaged, Winslow was towed clear of the action. Her commanding officer and several others in her crew were wounded. Lieutenant John Bernadou saw that the dead and wounded were transferred to Hudson, and he then left the ship after turning command over to Chief Gunner's Mate George P. Brady, who ‚Äî along with Chief Gunner's Mate Hans Johnsen and Chief Machinist T. C. Cooney ‚Äî later received the Medal of Honor. Because at the time members of the Revenue Cutter Service were not eligible for the Navy Medal of Honor, Congress approved a special medal struck for them. Frank Newcomb, the commanding officer of Hudson, received the medal in gold, his officers received it in silver, and the enlisted crewmen in bronze. On the Spanish side, Teniente de Nav√≠o Montes, commander of the Antonio L√≥pez, received the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand.Franco Casta√±√≥n, Hermenegildo, 1898: Los espa√±oles que derrotaron a EE.UU.

On 8/9 April 1944 at the Battle of Kohima, British India, Lance-Corporal Harman was commanding a section of a forward platoon where soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army had established a machine-gun post within 50 yards of his company and were becoming a menace. Since it was not possible to bring fire on to the enemy post the lance- corporal went forward by himself and threw a grenade into the position, destroying it. He returned carrying the enemy machinegun as a trophy. Early next morning, having ordered covering fire from his Bren gun team, he went out alone, with a Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle with fixed bayonet and charged a party of Japanese soldiers who were digging in. He shot four and bayoneted one. On his way back, Lance Corporal Harman was severely wounded by a burst of enemy machine-gun fire and died soon after reaching British lines. Having been shot Harman was recovered to the nearest trench by his company commander, Captain Donald Easten, and died in his arms. p269.

It comprises the south-west half of the Got≈ç Islands plus (uninhabited) Danjo and Hizen Torishima archipelagos in the East China Sea. Although the core islands of the city lay some 100 kilometers from Nagasaki, the other archipelagos lay 60 km further to South- West. The city consists of 11 inhabited and 52 uninhabited islands. The three main islands of the city are Fukue, Hisaka, and Naru. As of March 31, 2017, the city has an estimated population of 37,775 and a population density of 90 persons per km2. The total area is 420.81 km2. History The area which is now Got≈ç City was a port of call on the trade route between Japan and Tang Dynasty China in the Nara period. Noted Buddhist prelate Kukai stopped at Got≈ç in 806. The islands came under the control of the Got≈ç clan from the Muromachi period and was the location of intense European missionary activity in the late 16th century, which converted most of the population to the Kirishitan faith. After the start of the Tokugawa bakufu, the area was part of Fukue Domain in the Edo period. Fukue City was established in 1954. Most of the town was destroyed in a fire in 1962. The modern city of Got≈ç was established on August 1, 2004, from the merger of the city of Fukue with the towns of Kishiku, Miiraku, Naru, Tamanoura and Tomie (all from Minamimatsuura District). The population of the area has declined from over 60,000 inhabitants in 1980 due to economic migration and aging population issues.

Hall: Seahorses: An Identification Guide to the World's Species and their Conversation. London: Project Seahorse, 1999 Description and biology Syngnathids are found in temperate and tropical seas across the world. Most species inhabit shallow, coastal waters, but a few are known from the open ocean, especially in association with sargassum mats. They are characterised by their elongated snouts, fused jaws, the absence of pelvic fins, and by thick plates of bony armour covering their bodies. The armour gives them a rigid body, so they swim by rapidly fanning their fins. As a result, they are relatively slow compared with other fishes, but are able to control their movements with great precision, including hovering in place for extended periods. Uniquely, after syngnathid females lay their eggs, the male then fertilizes and carries the eggs during incubation, using one of several methods. Male seahorses have a specialized ventral pouch to carry the eggs, male sea dragons attach the eggs to their tails, and male pipefish may do either, depending on their species. The most fundamental difference between the different lineages of the family Syngnathidae is the location of male brood pouch.Hamilton, H., N. Saarman, G. Short, A. B. Sellas, B. Moore, T. Hoang, C. L. Grace, M. Gomon, et al. 2016. Molecular phylogeny and patterns of diversification in syngnathid fishes. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution.

Meyer. 2003. The dynamics of male brooding, mating patterns, and sex roles in pipefishes and seahorses (Family Syngnathidae). Evolution 57:1374‚Äì1386. There is also variation in Syngnathid pouch complexity with brood pouches ranging from simple ventral gluing areas to fully enclosed pouches.Dawson, C. E. 1985.

Most conventional sex role syngnathids are monogamous whereas sex role reversed species mostly exhibit polygamous behavior. Seahorses and pipefish also have a unique feeding mechanism, known as elastic recoil feeding. Although the mechanism is not well understood, seahorses and pipefish appear to have the ability to store energy from contraction of their epaxial muscles (used in upward head rotation), which they then release, resulting in extremely fast head rotation to accelerate their mouths towards unsuspecting prey.Van Wassenbergh et al., J.

They are one form of online deliberation. Further, online consultation consists in using the Internet to ask a group of people their opinion on one or more specific topics, allowing for trade-offs between participants. Generally, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a policy is being developed or implemented, e.g. to identify or access options, or to evaluate ongoing activities. This enables governments to draft more citizen-centered policy. As the Internet gains popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy development through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy. The rise of the Internet has given way to buzzwords such as e-democracy, referring to citizen participation in politics, government issues and policy development through electronic technologies and the Internet, and eGovernment, pertaining to providing citizens with government information and services online. Online consultation is an extension of these concepts. Through online engagement, government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public as they have a more direct route to citizen opinion via the Internet. The California Report Card (CRC) facilitates online consultation, working to support collaboration between citizens and the government though the Internet. Gavin Newsom, Lt. Governor of California, and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at University of California, Berkeley jointly launched the CRC in January 2014. The CRC allows for Californians to vote online on six timely issues. The site then redirects users to an electronic \\"cafe\\" using Principal Component Analysis. In the \\"cafe\\", participants can textually submit their own suggestions and assess the ideas of other users. The CRC offers a means of connecting the public to the California government. While this definition is framed in the Canadian context, other countries like the UK, Denmark, Scotland, and Australia can also be considered leaders in the field. These and many other countries are integrating online consultations and engagement using various methods and for a range of purposes. The European Union also utilises online consultations. These complement face-to-face consultations and help to create greater transparency of the democratic process. Online consultations are also increasingly being used by the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN hosts online consultations to allow for more inclusive drafting processes of policy guidelines, reports and strategy papers. The Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (FSN Forum) is tasked with carrying out many of these consultations. Channels Online consultations and engagement activities can utilize: *Websites, discussion boards, and electronic mailing lists, which have the ability to aid in policy development by providing the public with pertinent information and engaging them in order to extract feedback on issues. *Weblogs and real time online chat that can often put the public in direct contact with government officials, such as their MP, deputy or other political figure with whom they can share opinion and concerns See also *Accessibility *Chat rooms *Collaborative software *Direct democracy *Intranet and Extranet *Moderation *Online deliberation *Participatory democracy *Privacy *Security *Usability References External links * Electronic Engagement: A Guide for Public Sector Managers - Guide to electronic and online consultation published by the Australia and New Zealand School of Government. *Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition *Hansard Society *Index of all UK government consultations *Index of all EU consultations *OECD Report: Citizens as Partners (PDF) *Online Consultation Technologies Centre of Expertise *Online Consultations and Events - Top Ten Tips for Government and Civic Hosts E-democracy Social research ","title":"Online consultation"},{"id":"1212710","text":"Michael Vladimir Klesic (born July 31, 1975) is an American actor.

Purpose and Responsibilities Release notes are documents that are shared with end users, customers and clients of an organization. The definition of the terms 'End Users', 'Clients' and 'Customers' are very relative in nature and might have various interpretations based on the specific context. For instance, the Quality Assurance group within a software development organization can be interpreted as an internal customer. The release notes detail the corrections, changes or enhancements made to the service or product the company provides. This document is usually circulated only after the product or service is thoroughly tested and approved against the specification provided by the development team. However this document might also be provided as an artifact accompanying the deliverables for System Testing and System Integration Testing and other managed environments especially with reference to an information technology organization. Release notes can also contain test results and information about the test procedure. This kind of information gives readers of the release note more confidence in the fix/change done; this information also enables implementer of the change to conduct rudimentary acceptance tests. Content and Format There is no standard format for release notes that is followed throughout different organizations. Organizations normally adopt their own formatting styles based on the requirement and type of the information to be circulated. The content of release notes also vary according to the release type. For products that are at testing stage and that are newly released, the content is usually more descriptive compared to release notes for bug fixes and feature enhancements, which are usually brief. Release notes may include the following sections: * Header ‚Äì Document Name (i.e. Release Notes), product name, release number, release date, note date, note version, etc. * Overview - A brief overview of the product and changes, in the absence of other formal documentation. * Purpose - A brief overview of the purpose of the release note with a listing of what is new in this release, including bug fixes and new features. * Issue Summary - A short description of the bug or the enhancement in the release. * Steps to Reproduce - The steps that were followed when the bug was encountered. * Resolution - A short description of the modification/enhancement that was made to fix the bug. * End-User Impact - What different actions are needed by the end-users of the application.

Vinicio Romero Mart√≠nez. Editorial Larense. Caracas. 1987 He served as President of Gran Colombia from 1830 until 1831. He was an ardent supporter of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and one of his most trusted and loyal allies.Monografias \\"Generales de Bol√≠var\\", 2013  Personal life  Dolores Vargas Par√≠s, wife of Urdaneta Rafael Urdaneta was born in Maracaibo, Captaincy General of Venezuela to a prominent family of Spanish descent on October 24, 1788. He was a son of the marriage between Miguel Jer√≥nimo de Urdaneta y Troconis and Mar√≠a Alejandrina de Far√≠as. He began his elementary education in Maracaibo, and his secondary education in Caracas. Prior to the independence war, he was a student of Latin and philosophy. He married Dolores Vargas Par√≠s, a young and renowned heroine of the city of Santa Fe, in Santa Fe, Gran Colombia, on August 31, 1822. Before Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1831, the marriage had enjoyed much popularity. However, following the dissolution and the establishment of a dictatorship in the Republic of New Granada, they were forced to flee the country. Upon reaching Maracaibo, Venezuela (Urdaneta's native city), they suffered persecution from General P√°ez, who had become one of Bol√≠var's ideological adversaries after the end of the Venezuelan War of Independence. Urdaneta and Dolores were supporters of Bol√≠var's cause; so they were forced to flee again, this time to Cura√ßao. In 1832, they were able to return to Caracas through a license granted to the family by the government of Venezuela, but it stipulated that Urdaneta was not to intervene in the politics of the country. The family moved to Santa Ana de Coro, where a revolt erupted against the government. This opened the doors for Urdaneta to venture into Venezuelan politics once again. He was eventually able to retain a position as a senator until 1845. In 1845, he was appointed Envoy of Venezuela to Spain, but he died in Paris, France, on the 23rd of August of that year from complications from kidney stones, and before ever reaching Spain. Urdaneta is buried in the National Pantheon of Venezuela since May 16, 1876. In 2015, the 24th of October was decreed as a national holiday in Venezuela to commemorate him.  Military career  Encouraged by his uncle, Mart√≠n de Urdaneta y Troconis, who had been employed in Santa Fe, Viceroyalty of New Granada as the chief accountant of the Court of Accounts of the Real Audiencia of Santa Fe, Urdaneta traveled to that city in 1804 with the intention of developing his studies. He lived several years in Santa Fe, acquiring experience in the administration of military affairs. On July 20, 1810, a junta was formed in Santa Fe: one of the many independence movements that were beginning to take shape across the entire continent following the establishment of the Caracas Junta in April of that year; Urdaneta joined the movement. He was incorporated into the first battalion of the patriot army of New Granada on November 1, 1810, as a lieutenant, and the following year fought in the Campa√±a del Sur of New Granada. Following the Battle of Santa Fe in 1813, he was captured by the royalists and imprisoned for a few months before being liberated. = Admirable Campaign = Sim√≥n Bol√≠var had been exiled from Venezuelan territory after the collapse of the first republic he had established in 1811, but by 1813 he was fighting the royalists in the New Granada region. It was during this time that Urdaneta was able to join Bol√≠var's revolutionary army. Bol√≠var's Admirable Campaign to reclaim Venezuela proved to be a stage for Urdaneta. He distinguished himself under the command of colonel Jos√© F√©lix Ribas on July 2, 1813, in the Battle of Niquitao, and was decisive for the patriot victory at the Battle of Taguanes against the royalist forces of Colonel Juli√°n Izquierdo. Following the patriot victory and the establishment of the Second Republic of Venezuela, in the report before the New Granada Congress at Tunja, Bol√≠var described Urdaneta as: \\"worthy of recommendation and deserving of all esteem from the government for the valor and intelligence with which he distinguished himself in action.\\" From that moment on he led numerous military actions, among which stand out the Battle of Barbula, the Retreat to the East, the Siege of Santa Fe (after which he was promoted to Lieutenant-general at only 26 years of age), the Capture of Maracaibo, and the March to San Carlos in 1821 that liberated the Province of Coro and set the stage for the Battle of Carabobo. He did not participate in the Battle of Carabobo since Bol√≠var considered that the exhaustion his troops had suffered during the march was too great. In view of Urdaneta's service, Bol√≠var requested at this moment that he be promoted to General Officer. Following the Battle of Carabobo in 1821, with Venezuela independent and after years of service to the patriotic cause, Urdaneta became one of Bol√≠var's closest friends and collaborators. = Conspiraci√≥n Septembrina = In 1828 Urdaneta, then Minister of War and presiding over the Cabinet, was in charge of judging the alleged traitors behind the September Conspiracy by which an attempt was made to assassinate Bol√≠var, then president of Gran Colombia. Convinced without any doubt that Francisco de Paula Santander was the head conspirator, Urdaneta, along with the majority of the ministers in the Cabinet, sentenced him to death. Bol√≠var was afraid for the stability of the union between New Granada and Venezuela, so he forced Santander to lifelong exile instead. However, conflicts such as this one, in addition to the assassination of Antonio Jos√© de Sucre in 1830, ultimately led to the collapse of Gran Colombia and; therefore, the union for which Bol√≠var had sacrificed so much to maintain since independence was achieved. Throughout his life, Urdaneta also served as Chief of Army Staff and as Minister of War and Navy. Bol√≠var called him \\"El Brillante\\" (\\"The Brilliant\\"), for his remarkable sense of strategy in battle; a name now used to refer to him in Venezuelan historiography.INCES \\"Erase una vez un hombre llamado Rafael Urdaneta\\", 2013 He is considered to have been \\"the most loyal of loyals to Bol√≠var\\". His loyalty to the patriotic cause and the ideals of Bol√≠var was perpetuated in the words he once said to him:  Presidency  Monument to Rafael Urdaneta in the National Pantheon of Venezuela Venezuelan bol√≠var banknote depicting Rafael Urdaneta, 2018 In 1830, the rising animosity between New Granadians and Venezuelans reached a boiling point. At the time, the Venezuelan battalion Callao, loyal to General Bol√≠var, was stationed in Bogot√°. Another battalion, loyal to General Francisco de Paula Santander, and also stationed in the same city, persuaded the Government to relocate Callao to the city of Tunja. This action provoked an uproar in the civilian population from Venezuela that lived in Bogot√°, and triggered a confrontation between both battalions. The Callao battalion defeated the Neogranadine battalion and President Joaqu√≠n Mosquera y Arboleda and Vice President Domingo Caycedo y Sanz de Santamar√≠a fled from the capital. On September 5, 1830, General Urdaneta took control of the presidency under the title of \\"Provisional Chief of the Government of the Republic of Colombia\\". It was the hope of General Urdaneta and his allies to persuade Bol√≠var, who had resigned in May of that year, to return to the capital and once again take over as president. When it became clear that Bol√≠var would not return to the capital, and in an effort to restore peace and order, Urdaneta ordered Congress to convene on June 15, 1831, in the city of Villa de Leyva. Nevertheless, before congress could convene, the Neogranadine generals expressed their displeasure against General Urdaneta, and military actions erupted throughout the country. Generals Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando and Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez took control of the southern states of New Granada, and General Jos√© Salvador C√≥rdova Mu√±oz of the northern states. On April 14, 1831, the advancing armies proclaimed Caycedo as the legitimate head of the executive, and requested General Urdaneta to enter into peace negotiations. Urdaneta accepted, and met with the Neogranadine generals in the town of Apulo. On 28 April both parties signed the Treaty of Apulo, by which peace was secured and Urdaneta relinquished power.

He was a member the prominent Goldsmith family. The eldest son of Major Frank Goldsmith, and elder brother of the financier James Goldsmith. Edward Goldsmith was the founding editor and publisher of The Ecologist. Known for his outspoken views opposing industrial society and economic development, he expressed a strong sympathy for the ways and values of traditional peoples. He co-authored the influential A Blueprint for Survival with Robert Allen, becoming a founding member of the political party \\"People\\" (later renamed the Green Party), itself largely inspired by the Blueprint. Goldsmith's more conservative view of environmentalism put him at odds with socialist currents of thought which came to dominate within the Green Party. A deep ecologist and systems theorist, Goldsmith was an early proponent of the Gaia hypothesis, having previously developed a similar cybernetic concept of a self-regulating biosphere. A talented after-dinner speaker and raconteur, Goldsmith was an articulate spokesman and campaigner, receiving a number of awards for his work protecting the natural world and highlighting the importance and plight of indigenous peoples, including an honorary Right Livelihood Award and the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur.  Early life  Goldsmith (widely known as Teddy) was born in Paris in 1928 to a German Jewish father, Frank Goldsmith, and French mother, Marcelle Mouiller. He entered Millfield School, Somerset, as a grammar student, and he later graduated with honours in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Magdalen College, Oxford (1947‚Äì1950). While studying at Oxford, Goldsmith rejected the reductionist and compartmentalised ideas taught at the time, and he sought a more holistic worldview with which to study societies and the problems facing the world at large. After fulfilling his National Service as a British Intelligence Officer in Hamburg and Berlin, he involved himself unsuccessfully in a number of business ventures and devoted most of his spare time to the study of the subjects that were to preoccupy him for the rest of his life. Throughout the 1960s, he spent time travelling the world with his close friend, John Aspinall, witnessing at first hand the destruction of traditional societies. He concluded that the spread of economic development and its accompanying industrialisation, far from being progressive as claimed, was actually the root cause of social and environmental destruction.Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. pp.28‚Äì9  Work  = Primitive People's Fund = In London, at meetings of the Primitive People's Fund (the committee that founded Survival International), Goldsmith teamed up with the fund's treasurer Robert Prescott-Allen, the explorer Jean Liedloff, and a writer from World Medicine, Peter Bunyard, to found The Ecologist in 1969. = \\"Theory of a Unified Science\\" = After rejecting what he saw as the excessively reductionist and compartmentalised approach of mainstream academia, he spent much of his time researching and developing his own theories for the unification of the sciences.The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978. p iv The Theory of a Unified Science was heavily influenced by cybernetics, as well as the General Systems Theory of Ludwig von Bertalanffy, the holism of the early academic ecologists, and the functionalism employed by many anthropologists.The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998. Introduction His theory would later be published, in its final form, as The Way: An Ecological World View. (see below) Early on, Goldsmith had formulated a concept of the biosphere as an integrated cybernetic entity, the self- regulating parts (in which he included tribal societies) co-operating, largely unconsciously, for the mutual benefit of the whole, a view that anticipated aspects of the Gaia thesis, of which he was to become a leading proponent.Gaia, the Thesis, the Mechanisms and the Implications, edited by Peter Bunyard and Edward Goldsmith. Wadebridge Ecological Centre, 1988. Goldsmith was also a critic of neo-Darwinism. He claimed that it is a reductionist theory and that if you understand evolution, it is necessary to \\"abandon the reductionistic and mechanistic paradigm of science\\".The Ecologist Vol. 20 No. 2, March‚ÄìApril 1990 Online = The Ecologist = Having established The Ecologist in 1969 with founding editors Robert Allen, Jean Liedloff, and Peter Bunyard, Goldsmith was to use the journal as a platform for his theoretical concerns with regular articles appearing under the heading \\"Towards a Unified Science\\". The journal also became an important forum for the early green movement, with articles focusing on the relevance and survival of hunter-gatherer societies, alternative technology and organic farming, together with prescient articles about climate change,The Ecologist Vol. 1 No. 1The Ecologist Vol. 2 No. 1 resource depletion,Can Britain Survive? Edited by Edward Goldsmith. Tom Stacey, 1971 and nuclear accidents. They were accompanied by the usual gamut of articles examining pollution, overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion, corporate power, large dams, and, not least, the World Bank's alleged role in \\"financing the destruction of our planet\\".The Ecologist Vol.1, Nos 1‚Äì18. = A Blueprint For Survival = Signed by over thirty of the leading scientists of the day, including Sir Julian Huxley, Sir Frank Fraser Darling, Sir Peter Medawar, Sir Peter Scott, and C. H. Waddington, Goldsmith and his fellow editor Robert Allen made headlines in January 1972 with A Blueprint for Survival. The Blueprint was a far reaching proposal for a radical transition to a largely decentralised and deindustrialised society, an attempt to prevent what the authors referred to as \\" the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life- support systems on this planet\\". It became a key text for the early Green movement, selling over half a million copies, and it was translated into 16 languages. In many ways, it anticipated the concerns taken up by today's Transition Movement. Goldsmith and Allen argued that rather than devise imaginary utopias, as did Marxist and liberal political theorists of the time, they should instead look to the example of existing tribal peoples, who, the authors claimed, were real-life working models of societies perfectly adapted to both their long-term survival needs and the needs of the living world on which they depended. The tribal peoples alone, the authors argued, had demonstrated a viable means by which the most pressing problems facing humanity could be answered successfully.Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p229-30 Such societies were characterised by their small, human-scale communities, low- impact technologies, successful population controls, sustainable resource management, holistic and ecologically integrated worldviews and a high degree of social cohesion, physical health, psychological well-being and spiritual fulfilment of their members.The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978.The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998. = The People Party = The Blueprint was a major inspiration for the embryonic political party called \\"People\\" (later to become the Green Party,) which invited Goldsmith to stand for the Eye constituency in Suffolk as their candidate in the February 1974 general election. The campaign focused on the threat of desertification from the intensive farming practised in the area, which Goldsmith emphasised with the help of a Bactrian camel supplied by Aspinall. Goldsmith was in turn accompanied by bearded supporters dressed in the garb of Arab sheiks, the implication being that if modern oil-intensive farming practises were allowed to continue, the camel would be the only viable means of transport left in Suffolk. Goldsmith lost his deposit, but his unorthodox campaign succeeded in attracting the media's attention and highlighted the issues. He again stood for the now-renamed Ecology Party at the European elections in 1979, now winning a more respectable portion of the vote. = Cornwall = In 1973, buoyed by the success of the Blueprint and a sudden rise in public awareness of ecological issues, partly brought about by the Stockholm Conference and the publication of the Club of Rome's The Limits to Growth in the same year. Goldsmith and his editorial team moved from their offices in London to relocate to rural Cornwall, in the far west of England.Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p239 Goldsmith and his colleagues bought themselves farms, and for the following 17 years, they attempted to form a small-scale, relatively self- sufficient community of their own, and The Ecologist continued to be produced on-site, in between their other chores. In 1977, when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) threatened to site a nuclear reactor on farmland in Luxulyan, Cornwall, Goldsmith was among those who organised a continuous sit- in of the land, with local people blocking the entrance and staffing round- the-clock garrisons to prevent CEGB contractors from starting their drilling work. An early example of an environmental protest camp, the High Court of England and Wales eventually awarded in favour of CEGB allowing the drilling to go ahead. The CEGB never went on to develop the site, however. = The Gandhi Peace Foundation = In 1974, Goldsmith spent four months with the Gandhi Peace Foundation in New Delhi, comparing the Gandhian (Sarvodaya) movement with the Ecology movement in Europe. This led Goldsmith to forge close links with Indian environmental activists, in particular with the Chipko movement, including Sunderlal Bahuguna and Vandana Shiva. That was to have a major influence on Goldsmith's approach to environmental activism and led to a special issue of The Ecologist on the subject.The Ecologist Vol. 5 No. 8 = World Bank = In 1984, together with his colleague Nicholas Hildyard, Goldsmith authored a multi-volume report on the destructive effects of large- scale, hydroelectric dams. It was the beginning of a long attack against the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which Goldsmith and his colleagues accused of financing the destruction of the planet. In one episode, Goldsmith wrote an open letter to the then President of the World Bank, Alden W. Clausen, demanding that the bank \\"stop financing the destruction of the tropical world, the devastation of its remaining forests, the extermination of its wildlife and the impoverishment and starvation of its human inhabitants\\". At the time, the connection between large-scale development projects and social and environmental destruction had not been widely recognised, even within the environmental movement. = Forests campaign = In 1989, Goldsmith helped to organise an international campaign calling for an immediate end to the destruction of the world's remaining forests with its detrimental effects on indigenous cultures, biodiversity and global climate. The campaign raised over 3 million signatures, which were taken in wheelbarrows to the UN's headquarters in New York City. Goldsmith and a party of activists subsequently occupied the main lobby, refusing to move until the Secretary General, Perez de Cuellar, agreed to see them. The group demanded for him to call an extraordinary general meeting of the Security Council to tackle the global crisis of deforestation. Although failing, the campaign managed to organise a meeting in the US Senate with a group of senators, headed by Al Gore, whom the activists called upon to end their support of the World Bank. = The Goldsmith Foundation = In 1991, with the financial support of his brother James, Goldsmith established the Goldsmith (JMG) Foundation supporting a diverse range of non-governmental organisations campaigning against environmentally destructive activities, along with organisations providing sustainable alternatives. = The Way = In 1990, urged on by Arne N√¶ss, Goldsmith left the editorship of The Ecologist to Nicholas Hildyard, while taking time off to write his philosophical magnum opus The Way: an ecological worldview.\\"The Ecologist Magazine 1970‚Äì2007: a case study\\" Master's thesis Kristen Harding. University of Plymouth, September 2007 The Way (1992) was the culmination and synthesis of more than four decades of theoretical development, embodying a \\"coherent worldview\\" by which Goldsmith would attempt to explain the self-inflicted problems facing the world and to propose a way out of them. Much of the work was already mature in Goldsmith's mind by the time that he published the first issues of The Ecologist in 1970.Towards a Unified Science. The Ecologist Vol.1, Vol.2, Vol. 3 = Later life = In addition to the UK Ecologist, Goldsmith later helped to found and support The Ecologist as independent enterprises in many parts of the world: : Brazil (in Portuguese); France (in French); Asia (India); Italy (in Italian); Greece (in Greek); The Pacific (New Zealand); Lebanon (in Arabic); Latin America (in Spanish); and Colombia (in Spanish). He continued to attend key meetings around the world and involved himself with a variety of campaign organisations by becoming President of the Climate Initiatives Fund, Richmond, London; a board member of the International Forum on Globalization, San Francisco, USA; a founder member of Marunui Conservation Ltd., Mangawhai, New Zealand (1987); and a founder member and vice-president of ECOROPA, a European ecological club and think tank (1975).  Philosophy  * Degrowth * Holism * Human scale * Neotribalism * Perennial Philosophy  Controversies  In 1997, after an acrimonious split with his editorial team, most notably with his former friend and colleague Nicholas Hildyard, Goldsmith was left to run The Ecologist on his own. Having been absent for some years, he brought in the International Society for Ecology and Culture (ISEC) to act as the editorial team. His nephew Zac, who was then working for ISEC, eventually took over the editorship on their behalf. The split with Hildyard led to a period of often-bitter criticism from some members of the political left in the environmental movement, which, compounded with failing health, resulted in a period of isolation from the British scene. Goldsmith was accused of having affiliated himself with the Nouvelle Droite, an intellectual voice of the European \\"New Right\\", after addressing a symposium on Green issues organised in Paris by the GRECE (Research and Study Group on European Culture),\\"El√©ments pour la Civilisation Europ√©enne\\", quarterly issue 81, p. 51. November 1994, Paris a school of political thought founded largely on the works of Alain de Benoist.\\"Actes des Colloques nationaux du GRECE (with Alain de Benoist) including: √âtats-unis: danger, Paris, December 1992: Les Enjeux de l'Ecologie (The Challenges of Ecology), Paris, November 1994 It was the attending of that and another similar event that had led to rising tensions with his colleague Nicholas Hildyard. The title of Goldsmith's contribution in Paris being simply \\"Une soci√©t√© √©cologique: la seule alternative\\" (An Ecological Society: The Only Alternative).\\"Actes du XXVIII√®me colloque national du GRECE: \\"Gauche- Droite: la Fin d'un Systeme\\", Paris. Published in December 1995 Later, in a controversial article for the Guardian newspaper, entitled \\"Black Shirts in Green Trousers\\", George Monbiot (a cofounder of the left-wing political party Respect) accused Goldsmith of having \\"advocated the enforced separation of Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda and Protestants and Catholics in Ulster, on the grounds that they constitute 'distinct ethnic groups' and are thus culturally incapable of co-habitation\\" (a point rejected by Goldsmith). That, along with other attacks, eventually led Goldsmith to counter his critics with his indepth rebuttal My Answer. Goldsmith's close association with his brother, Sir James Goldsmith, his lifelong friendship with the controversial casino owner and conservationist John Aspinall, along with his anti-modernist stance and support for indigenous peoples, ensured that Goldsmith had many detractors throughout his life. Still, Goldsmith received affectionate support and respect from across the full spectrum of the environmental movement and from many of the people whose views and preoccupations were the focus of his theoretical and philosophical critique. Goldsmith's message continued to be sponsored around the world, in particular through his work with the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), and, regardless of their previous acrimony, Hildyard and Goldsmith went on to restore their former friendship.

Pezzottaite is a caesium analogue of beryl, a silicate of caesium, beryllium, lithium and aluminium, with the chemical formula Cs(Be2Li)Al2Si6O18. Named after Italian geologist and mineralogist Federico Pezzotta, pezzottaite was first thought to be either red beryl or a new variety of beryl (\\"caesium beryl\\"); unlike actual beryl, however, pezzottaite contains lithium and crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system rather than the hexagonal system. Colors include shades of raspberry red to orange-red and pink. Recovered from miarolitic cavities in the granitic pegmatite fields of Fianarantsoa province, southern Madagascar, the pezzottaite crystals were small--no more than about in their widest dimension --and tabular or equant in habit, and few in number, most being heavily included with growth tubes and liquid feathers. Approximately 10 per cent of the rough material would also exhibit chatoyancy when polished. Most cut pezzottaite gems are under one carat (200 mg) in weight and rarely exceed two carats (400 mg). With the exception of hardness (8 on Mohs scale), the physical and optical properties of pezzottaite--i.e., specific gravity 3.10 (average), refractive index 1.601 to 1.620, birefringence 0.008 to 0.011 (uniaxial negative)--are all higher than typical beryl. Pezzottiate is brittle with a conchoidal to irregular fracture, and streaks white. Like beryl, it has an imperfect to fair basal cleavage. Pleochroism is moderate, from pink-orange or purplish pink to pinkish purple. Pezzottaite's absorption spectrum, as seen by a hand-held (direct vision) spectroscope, features a band at 485-500 nm with some specimens showing additional weak lines at 465 and 477 nm and a weak band at 550 to 580 nm. Most (if not all) of the Madagascan deposits have since been exhausted. Pezzottaite has been found in at least one other locality, Afghanistan: this material was first thought to be caesium-rich morganite (pink beryl). Like morganite and bixbite, pezzottaite is believed to owe its color to radiation-induced color centres involving trivalent manganese. Pezzottaite will lose its color if heated to 450 ¬∞C for two hours, but the color can be restored with gamma irradiation.

T. Coleridge, 1817). In his own time, William Shakespeare (1564‚Äì1616) was rated as merely one among many talented playwrights and poets, but since the late 17th century has been considered the supreme playwright and poet of the English language. No other dramatist's work has been performed even remotely as often on the world stage as Shakespeare. The plays have often been drastically adapted in performance. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the era of the great acting stars, to be a star on the British stage was synonymous with being a great Shakespearean actor. Then the emphasis was placed on the soliloquies as declamatory turns at the expense of pace and action, and Shakespeare's plays seemed in peril of disappearing beneath the added music, scenery, and special effects produced by thunder, lightning, and wave machines. Editors and critics of the plays, disdaining the showiness and melodrama of Shakespearean stage representation, began to focus on Shakespeare as a dramatic poet, to be studied on the printed page rather than in the theatre. The rift between Shakespeare on the stage and Shakespeare on the page was at its widest in the early 19th century, at a time when both forms of Shakespeare were hitting peaks of fame and popularity: theatrical Shakespeare was successful spectacle and melodrama for the masses, while book or closet drama Shakespeare was being elevated by the reverential commentary of the Romantics into unique poetic genius, prophet, and bard. Before the Romantics, Shakespeare was simply the most admired of all dramatic poets, especially for his insight into human nature and his realism, but Romantic critics such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge refactored him into an object of almost religious adoration, George Bernard Shaw coining the term \\"bardolatry\\" to describe it. These critics regarded Shakespeare as towering above other writers, and regarding his plays not as \\"merely great works of art\\" but as \\"phenomena of nature, like the sun and the sea, the stars and the flowers\\" and \\"with entire submission of our own faculties\\" (Thomas De Quincey, 1823). To the later 19th century, Shakespeare became in addition an emblem of national pride, the crown jewel of English culture, and a \\"rallying-sign\\", as Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1841, for the whole British empire. 17th century =Jacobean and Caroline= A 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the platform or apron stage of the typical circular Elizabethan open-roof playhouse The Swan. It is difficult to assess Shakespeare's reputation in his own lifetime and shortly after. England had little modern literature before the 1570s, and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I. The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence. He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets, but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney, who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age, or of Edmund Spenser. Shakespeare's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays; but Shakespeare's plays were written for performance by his own company, and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays, Shakespeare's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed. That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market, and the regular patronage of his company by the court, culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the \\"King's Men,\\" suggests his popularity among higher stations of society. Modern plays (as opposed to those in Latin and Greek) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays. Some of Shakespeare's plays, particularly the history plays, were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto (i.e. pamphlet) form; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition. After Ben Jonson pioneered the canonisation of modern plays by printing his own works in folio (the luxury book format) in 1616, Shakespeare was the next playwright to be honoured by a folio collection, in 1623. That this folio went into another edition within 9 years indicates he was held in unusually high regard for a playwright. The dedicatory poems by Ben Jonson and John Milton in the 2nd folio were the first to suggest Shakespeare was the supreme poet of his age. These expensive reading editions are the first visible sign of a rift between Shakespeare on the stage and Shakespeare for readers, a rift that was to widen over the next two centuries. In his 1630 work 'Timber' or 'Discoveries', Ben Jonson praised the speed and ease with which Shakespeare wrote his plays as well as his contemporary's honesty and gentleness towards others. =Interregnum and Restoration= During the Interregnum (1642‚Äì1660), all public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. Though denied the use of the stage, costumes and scenery, actors still managed to ply their trade by performing \\"drolls\\" or short pieces of larger plays that usually ended with some type of jig. Shakespeare was among the many playwrights whose works were plundered for these scenes. Among the most common scenes were Bottom's scenes from A Midsummer Night's Dream and the gravedigger's scene from Hamlet. When the theatres opened again in 1660 after this uniquely long and sharp break in British theatrical history, two newly licensed London theatre companies, the Duke's and the King's Company, started business with a scramble for performance rights to old plays. Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the Beaumont and Fletcher team were among the most valuable properties and remained popular after Restoration playwriting had gained momentum. Restoration playhouses had elaborate scenery. They retained a shortened version of the apron stage for actor/audience contact, although it is not visible in this picture (the artist is standing on it). In the elaborate Restoration London playhouses, designed by Christopher Wren, Shakespeare's plays were staged with music, dancing, thunder, lightning, wave machines, and fireworks. The texts were \\"reformed\\" and \\"improved\\" for the stage. A notorious example is Irish poet Nahum Tate's happy-ending King Lear (1681) (which held the stage until 1838), while The Tempest was turned into an opera replete with special effects by William Davenant. In fact, as the director of the Duke's Company, Davenant was legally obliged to reform and modernise Shakespeare's plays before performing them, an ad hoc ruling by the Lord Chamberlain in the battle for performance rights which \\"sheds an interesting light on the many 20th-century denunciations of Davenant for his adaptations\\".(Hume, p. 20) The modern view of the Restoration stage as the epitome of Shakespeare abuse and bad taste has been shown by Hume to be exaggerated, and both scenery and adaptation became more reckless in the 18th and 19th centuries. The incomplete Restoration stage records suggest Shakespeare, although always a major repertory author, was bested in the 1660‚Äì1700 period by the phenomenal popularity of Beaumont and Fletcher. \\"Their plays are now the most pleasant and frequent entertainments of the stage\\", reported fellow playwright John Dryden in 1668, \\"two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shakespeare's or Jonson's\\". In the early 18th century, however, Shakespeare took over the lead on the London stage from Beaumont and Fletcher, never to relinquish it again. By contrast to the stage history, in literary criticism there was no lag time, no temporary preference for other dramatists: Shakespeare had a unique position at least from the Restoration in 1660 and onwards. While Shakespeare did not follow the unbending French neo-classical \\"rules\\" for the drama and the three classical unities of time, place, and action, those strict rules had never caught on in England, and their sole zealous proponent Thomas Rymer was hardly ever mentioned by influential writers except as an example of narrow dogmatism. Dryden, for example, argued in his influential Essay of Dramatick Poesie (1668) ‚Äì the same essay in which he noted that Shakespeare's plays were performed only half as often as those of Beaumont and Fletcher ‚Äì for Shakespeare's artistic superiority. Though Shakespeare does not follow the dramatic conventions, Dryden wrote, Ben Jonson does, and as a result Jonson lands in a distant second place to \\"the incomparable Shakespeare\\", the follower of nature, the untaught genius, the great realist of human character. 18th century =Britain= In the 18th century, Shakespeare dominated the London stage, while Shakespeare productions turned increasingly into the creation of star turns for star actors. After the Licensing Act of 1737, a quarter of plays performed were by Shakespeare, and on at least two occasions rival London playhouses staged the very same Shakespeare play at the same time (Romeo and Juliet in 1755 and King Lear the next year) and still commanded audiences. This occasion was a striking example of the growing prominence of Shakespeare stars in the theatrical culture, the big attraction being the competition and rivalry between the male leads at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, Spranger Barry and David Garrick. There appears to have been no issues with Barry and Garrick, in their late thirties, playing adolescent Romeo one season and geriatric King Lear the next. In September 1769 Garrick staged a major Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon which was a major influence on the rise of bardolatry.Pierce pp. 4‚Äì10 It was at the Shakespeare Jubilee that Garrick paid tribute to the Shakespeare Ladies Club thanking them for saving Shakespeare from obscurity. He said: \\"It was You Ladies that restor‚Äôd Shakespeare to the Stage you form‚Äôd yourselves into a Society to protect his Fame, and Erected a Monument to his and your own honour in Westminster Abbey.\\" David Garrick as Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing, 1770. As performance playscripts diverged increasingly from their originals, the publication of texts intended for reading developed rapidly in the opposite direction, with the invention of textual criticism and an emphasis on fidelity to Shakespeare's original words. The texts that we read and perform today were largely settled in the 18th century. Nahum Tate and Nathaniel Lee had already prepared editions and performed scene divisions in the late 17th century, and Nicholas Rowe's edition of 1709 is considered the first truly scholarly text for the plays. It was followed by many good 18th-century editions, crowned by Edmund Malone's landmark Variorum Edition, which was published posthumously in 1821 and remains the basis of modern editions. These collected editions were meant for reading, not staging; Rowe's 1709 edition was, compared to the old folios, a light pocketbook. Shakespeare criticism also increasingly spoke to readers, rather than to theatre audiences. The only aspects of Shakespeare's plays that were consistently disliked and singled out for criticism in the 18th century were the puns (\\"clenches\\") and the \\"low\\" (sexual) allusions. While a few editors, notably Alexander Pope, attempted to gloss over or remove the puns and the double entendres, they were quickly reversed, and by mid-century the puns and sexual humour were (with only a few exceptions, see Thomas Bowdler) back in permanently. Dryden's sentiments about Shakespeare's imagination and capacity for painting \\"nature\\" were echoed in the 18th century by, for example, Joseph Addison (\\"Among the English, Shakespeare has incomparably excelled all others\\"), Alexander Pope (\\"every single character in Shakespeare is as much an Individual as those in Life itself\\"), and Samuel Johnson (who scornfully dismissed Voltaire's and Rhymer's neoclassical Shakespeare criticism as \\"the petty cavils of petty minds\\"). The long-lived belief that the Romantics were the first generation to truly appreciate Shakespeare and to prefer him to Ben Jonson is contradicted by praise from writers throughout the 18th century. Ideas about Shakespeare that many people think of as typically post-Romantic were frequently expressed in the 18th and even in the 17th century: he was described as a genius who needed no learning, as deeply original, and as creating uniquely \\"real\\" and individual characters (see Timeline of Shakespeare criticism). To compare Shakespeare and his well-educated contemporary Ben Jonson was a popular exercise at this time, a comparison that was invariably complimentary to Shakespeare. It functioned to highlight the special qualities of both writers, and it especially powered the assertion that natural genius trumps rules, that \\"there is always an appeal open from criticism to nature\\" (Samuel Johnson). Opinion of Shakespeare was briefly shaped in the 1790s by the \\"discovery\\" of the Shakespeare Papers by William Henry Ireland. Ireland claimed to have found in a trunk a goldmine of lost documents of Shakespeare's including two plays, Vortigern and Rowena and Henry II. These documents appeared to demonstrate a number of unknown facts about Shakespeare that shaped opinion of his works, including a Profession of Faith demonstrating Shakespeare was a Protestant and that he had an illegitimate child. Although there were many believers in the provenance of the Papers they soon came under fierce attack from scholars who pointed out numerous inaccuracies. Vortigern had only one performance at the Drury Lane Theatre before Ireland admitted he had forged the documents and written the plays himself.Pierce pp. 137‚Äì181 =In Germany= English actors started visiting the Holy Roman Empire in the late 16th century to work as \\"fiddlers, singers and jugglers\\", and through them the work of Shakespeare had first become known in the Reich.Buruma, Ian Anglomania: A European Love Affair, New York: Vintage Books, 1998 p. 52. In 1601, in the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk, Poland), which had a large English merchant colony living within its walls, a company of English actors arrived to put on plays by Shakespeare. By 1610, the actors were performing Shakespeare in German as his plays had become popular in Danzig. Some of Shakespeare's work was performed in continental Europe during the 17th century, but it was not until the mid 18th century that it became widely known. In Germany Lessing compared Shakespeare to German folk literature. In France, the Aristotelian rules were rigidly obeyed, and in Germany, a land where French cultural influence was very strong (German elites preferred to speak French rather than German in the 18th century), the Francophile German theatre critics had long denounced Shakespeare's work as a \\"jumble\\" that violated all the Aristotelian rules.Buruma, Ian Anglomania: A European Love Affair, New York: Vintage Books, 1998 p. 57. As a part of an effort to get the German public to take Shakespeare more seriously, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe organised a Shakespeare jubilee in Frankfurt in 1771, stating in a speech on 14 October 1771 that the dramatist had shown that the Aristotelian unities were \\"as oppressive as a prison\\" and were \\"burdensome fetters on our imagination\\". Goethe praised Shakespeare for liberating his mind from the rigid Aristoltelian rules, saying: \\"I jumped into the free air, and suddenly felt I had hands and feet...Shakespeare, my friend, if you were with us today, I could only live with you\\".Buruma, Ian Anglomania: A European Love Affair, New York: Vintage Books, 1998 p. 57. Herder likewise proclaimed that reading Shakespeare's work opens \\"leaves from the book of events, of providence, of the world, blowing in the sands of time\\". This claim that Shakespeare's work breaks through all creative boundaries to reveal a chaotic, teeming, contradictory world became characteristic of Romantic criticism, later being expressed by Victor Hugo in the preface to his play Cromwell, in which he lauded Shakespeare as an artist of the grotesque, a genre in which the tragic, absurd, trivial and serious were inseparably intertwined. In 1995, the American journalist Stephen Kinzer writing in The New York Times observed: \\"Shakespeare is an all-but-guaranteed success in Germany, where his work has enjoyed immense popularity for more than 200 years. By some estimates, Shakespeare's plays are performed more frequently in Germany than anywhere else in the world, not excluding his native England. The market for his work, both in English and in German translation, seems inexhaustible.\\" The German critic Ernst Osterkamp wrote: \\"Shakespeare's importance to German literature cannot be compared with that of any other writer of the post-antiquity period. Neither Dante or Cervantes, neither Moliere or Ibsen have even approached his influence here. With the passage of time, Shakespeare has virtually become one of Germany's national authors.\\" =In Russia= Shakespeare as far it can be established never went any further from Stratford-upon-Avon than London, but he made a reference to the visit of Russian diplomats from the court of Tsar Ivan the Terrible to the court of Elizabeth I in Love Labor Lost in which the French aristocrats dress up as Russians and make fools of themselves.\\" Shakespeare was first translated into Russian by Alexander Sumarokov, who called Shakespeare an \\"inspired barbarian\\", who wrote of the Bard of Avon that in his plays ‚Äúthere is much that is bad and exceedingly good‚Äù. In 1786, Shakespeare's reputation in Russia was greatly enhanced when the Empress Catherine the Great translated a French version of The Merry Wives of Windsor into Russian (Catherine did not know English) and had it staged in St. Petersburg. Shortly afterwards, Catherine translated Timon of Athens from French into Russian. The patronage of Catherine made Shakespeare an eminently respectable author in Russia, but his plays were rarely performed until the 19th century, and instead he was widely read. 19th century =Shakespeare in performance= The Theatre Royal at Drury Lane in 1813. The platform stage is gone, and note the orchestra cutting off the actors from the audience. Theatres and theatrical scenery became ever more elaborate in the 19th century, and the acting editions used were progressively cut and restructured to emphasise more and more the soliloquies and the stars, at the expense of pace and action.See, for example, the 19th century playwright W. S. Gilbert's essay, Unappreciated Shakespeare, from Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales Performances were further slowed by the need for frequent pauses to change the scenery, creating a perceived need for even more cuts to keep performance length within tolerable limits; it became a generally accepted maxim that Shakespeare's plays were too long to be performed without substantial cuts. The platform, or apron, stage, on which actors of the 17th century would come forward for audience contact, was gone, and the actors stayed permanently behind the fourth wall or proscenium arch, further separated from the audience by the orchestra, see image right. Through the 19th century, a roll call of legendary actors' names all but drown out the plays in which they appear: Sarah Siddons (1755‚Äî1831), John Philip Kemble (1757‚Äî1823), Henry Irving (1838‚Äî1905), and Ellen Terry (1847‚Äî1928). To be a star of the legitimate drama came to mean being first and foremost a \\"great Shakespeare actor\\", with a famous interpretation of, for men, Hamlet, and for women, Lady Macbeth, and especially with a striking delivery of the great soliloquies. The acme of spectacle, star, and soliloquy Shakespeare performance came with the reign of actor-manager Henry Irving at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in London from 1878‚Äì99. At the same time, a revolutionary return to the roots of Shakespeare's original texts, and to the platform stage, absence of scenery, and fluid scene changes of the Elizabethan theatre, was being effected by William Poel's Elizabethan Stage Society. =Shakespeare in criticism= Thomas De Quincey: \\"O, mighty poet! Thy works are... like the phenomena of nature, like the sun and the sea, the stars and the flowers\\". The belief in the unappreciated 18th-century Shakespeare was proposed at the beginning of the 19th century by the Romantics, in support of their view of 18th-century literary criticism as mean, formal, and rule-bound, which was contrasted with their own reverence for the poet as prophet and genius. Such ideas were most fully expressed by German critics such as Goethe and the Schlegel brothers. Romantic critics such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Hazlitt raised admiration for Shakespeare to worship or even \\"bardolatry\\" (a sarcastic coinage from bard + idolatry by George Bernard Shaw in 1901, meaning excessive or religious worship of Shakespeare). To compare him to other Renaissance playwrights at all, even for the purpose of finding him superior, began to seem irreverent. Shakespeare was rather to be studied without any involvement of the critical faculty, to be addressed or apostrophised‚Äîalmost prayed to‚Äîby his worshippers, as in Thomas De Quincey's classic essay \\"On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth\\" (1823): \\"O, mighty poet! Thy works are not as those of other men, simply and merely great works of art; but are also like the phenomena of nature, like the sun and the sea, the stars and the flowers,‚Äîlike frost and snow, rain and dew, hail-storm and thunder, which are to be studied with entire submission of our own faculties...\\". As the concept of literary originality grew in importance, critics were horrified at the idea of adapting Shakespeare's tragedies for the stage by putting happy endings on them, or editing out the puns in Romeo and Juliet. In another way, what happened on the stage was seen as unimportant, as the Romantics, themselves writers of closet drama, considered Shakespeare altogether more suitable for reading than staging. Charles Lamb saw any form of stage representation as distracting from the true qualities of the text. This view, argued as a timeless truth, was also a natural consequence of the dominance of melodrama and spectacle on the early 19th-century stage. Shakespeare became an important emblem of national pride in the 19th century, which was the heyday of the British Empire and the acme of British power in the world. To Thomas Carlyle in On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History (1841), Shakespeare was one of the great poet-heroes of history, in the sense of being a \\"rallying-sign\\" for British cultural patriotism all over the world, including even the lost American colonies: \\"From Paramatta, from New York, wheresoever... English men and women are, they will say to one another, 'Yes, this Shakespeare is ours; we produced him, we speak and think by him; we are of one blood and kind with him'\\" (\\"The Hero as a Poet\\"). As the foremost of the great canonical writers, the jewel of English culture, and as Carlyle puts it, \\"merely as a real, marketable, tangibly useful possession\\", Shakespeare became in the 19th century a means of creating a common heritage for the motherland and all her colonies. Post-colonial literary critics have had much to say of this use of Shakespeare's plays in what they regard as a move to subordinate and deracinate the cultures of the colonies themselves. Across the North Sea, Shakespeare remained influential in Germany. In 1807, August Wilhelm Schlegel translated all of Shakespeare's plays into German, and such was the popularity of Schlegel's translation (which is generally regarded as one of the best translations of Shakespeare into any language) that German nationalists were soon starting to claim that Shakespeare was actually a German playwright who just written his plays in English.Buruma, Ian Anglomania: A European Love Affair, New York: Vintage Books, 1998 p. 51. By the middle of the 19th century, Shakespeare had been incorporated into the pantheon of German literature.Buruma, Ian Anglomania: A European Love Affair, New York: Vintage Books, 1998 p. 51. In 1904, a statue of Shakespeare was erected in Weimar showing the Bard of Avon staring into the distance, becoming the first statue built to honor Shakespeare on the mainland of Europe. =Romantic icon in Russia= In the Romantic age, Shakespeare became extremely popular in Russia. Vissarion Belinsky wrote he had been ‚Äúenslaved by the drama of Shakespeare‚Äù. Russia's national poet, Alexander Pushkin, was heavily influenced by Hamlet and the history plays, and his novel Boris Godunov showed strong Shakespearean influences. Later on, in the 19th century, the novelist Ivan Turgenev often wrote essays on Shakespeare with the best known being ‚ÄúHamlet and Don Quixote‚Äù. Fyodor Dostoevsky was greatly influenced by Macbeth with his novel Crime and Punishment showing Shakespearean influence in his treatment of the theme of guilt. From the 1840s onward, Shakespeare was regularly staged in Russia, and the black American actor Ira Aldridge who had been barred from the stage in the United States on the account of his skin color became the leading Shakespearean actor in Russia in the 1850s, being decorated by the Emperor Alexander II for his work in portraying Shakespearean characters. 20th century Shakespeare continued to be considered the greatest English writer of all time throughout the 20th century. Most Western educational systems required the textual study of two or more of Shakespeare's plays, and both amateur and professional stagings of Shakespeare were commonplace. It was the proliferation of high-quality, well-annotated texts and the unrivalled reputation of Shakespeare that allowed for stagings of Shakespeare's plays to remain textually faithful, but with an extraordinary variety in setting, stage direction, and costuming. Institutions such as the Folger Shakespeare Library in the United States worked to ensure constant, serious study of Shakespearean texts and the Royal Shakespeare Company in the United Kingdom worked to maintain a yearly staging of at least two plays. Shakespeare performances reflected the tensions of the times, and early in the century, Barry Jackson of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre began the staging of modern-dress productions, thus starting a new trend in Shakesperian production. Performances of the plays could be highly interpretive. Thus, play directors would emphasise Marxist, feminist, or, perhaps most popularly, Freudian psychoanalytical interpretations of the plays, even as they retained letter-perfect scripts. The number of analytical approaches became more diverse by the latter part of the century, as critics applied theories such as structuralism, New Historicism, Cultural materialism, African American studies, queer studies, and literary semiotics to Shakespeare's works. =In the Third Reich= In 1934 the French government banned, in permanence, performances of Coriolanus because of its perceived authoritarian undertones. In the international protests that followed came one from Germany, from none other than Joseph Goebbels. Although productions of Shakespeare's plays in Germany itself were subject to 'streamlining', he continued to be favoured as a great classical dramatist, especially so as almost every new German play since the late 1890s onwards was portrayed by German government propaganda as the work of left-wingers, of Jews or of \\"degenerates\\" of one kind or another. Politically acceptable writers had simply been unable to fill the gap, or had only been able to do so with the worst kinds of agitprop. In 1935 Goebbels was to say \\"We can build autobahns, revive the economy, create a new army, but we... cannot manufacture new dramatists.\\" With Schiller suspect for his radicalism, Lessing for his humanism and even the great Goethe for his lack of patriotism, the legacy of the \\"Aryan\\" Shakespeare was reinterpreted for new purposes. Rodney Symington, Professor of Germanic and Russian Studies at the University of Victoria, Canada, deals with this question in The Nazi Appropriation of Shakespeare: Cultural Politics in the Third Reich (Edwin Mellen Press, 2005). The scholar reports that Hamlet, for instance, was reconceived as a proto-German warrior rather than a man with a conscience. Of this play one critic wrote: \\"If the courtier Laertes is drawn to Paris and the humanist Horatio seems more Roman than Danish, it is surely no accident that Hamlet's alma mater should be Wittenberg.\\" A leading magazine declared that the crime which deprived Hamlet of his inheritance was a foreshadow of the Treaty of Versailles, and that the conduct of Gertrude was reminiscent of the spineless Weimar politicians. Weeks after Hitler took power in 1933 an official party publication appeared entitled Shakespeare ‚Äì a Germanic Writer, a counter to those who wanted to ban all foreign influences. At the Propaganda Ministry, Rainer Schlosser, given charge of German theatre by Goebbels, mused that Shakespeare was more German than English. After the outbreak of the war the performance of Shakespeare was banned, though it was quickly lifted by Hitler in person, a favour extended to no other. Not only did the regime appropriate the Bard but it also appropriated Elizabethan England itself. To the Nazi leaders, it was a young, vigorous nation, much like the Third Reich itself, quite unlike the decadent British Empire of the present day. Clearly there were some exceptions to the official approval of Shakespeare, and the great patriotic plays, most notably Henry V were shelved. The reception of The Merchant of Venice was at best lukewarm (Marlowe's The Jew of Malta was suggested as a possible alternative) because it was not anti-Semitic enough for Nazi taste (the play's conclusion, in which the daughter of the Jewish antagonist converts to Christianity and marries one of the Gentile protagonists, particularly violated Nazi notions of racial purity). So Hamlet was by far the most popular play, along with Macbeth and Richard III. =In the Soviet Union= Given the popularity of Shakespeare in Russia, there were film versions of Shakespeare that often differed from western interpretations, usually emphasizing a humanist message that implicitly criticized the Soviet regime.Howard, Tony \\"Shakespeare on film and video\\" pp. 607‚Äì619 from Shakespeare An Oxford Guide, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003 p. 611. Othello (1955) by Sergei Yutkevich celebrated Desdemona's love for Othello as a triumph of love over racial hatred.Howard, Tony \\"Shakespeare on film and video\\" pp. 607‚Äì619 from Shakespeare An Oxford Guide, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003 p. 611. Hamlet (1964) by Grigori Kozintsev portrayed 16th century Denmark as a dark, gloomy and oppressive place with recurring images of imprisonment marking the film from the focus on the portcullis of Elsinore to the iron corset Ophelia is forced to wear as she goes insane.Howard, Tony \\"Shakespeare on film and video\\" pp. 607‚Äì619 from Shakespeare An Oxford Guide, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003 p. 611. The tyranny of Claudius resembled the tyranny of Stalin with gigantic portraits and bursts of Claudius being prominent in the background of the film, suggesting that Claudius has engaged in a \\"cult of personality\\". Given the emphasis on images of imprisonment, Hamlet's decision to revenge his father becomes almost subsidiary to his struggle for freedom as he challenges the Stalin-like tyranny of Claudius.Howard, Tony \\"Shakespeare on film and video\\" pp. 607‚Äì619 from Shakespeare An Oxford Guide, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003 page 611. Hamlet in this film resembles a Soviet dissident who despite his own hesitation, fears and doubts, can no longer stand the moral rot around him. The film was based on a script written by the novelist Boris Pasternak, who had been persecuted under Stalin.Howard, Tony \\"Shakespeare on film and video\\" pp. 607‚Äì619 from Shakespeare An Oxford Guide, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003 p. 611. The 1971 version of King Lear, also directed by Kozintsev presented the play as a \\"Tolstoyan panorama of bestiality and courage\\" as Lear finds his moral redemption amongst the common people.Howard, Tony \\"Shakespeare on film and video\\" pp. 607‚Äì619 from Shakespeare An Oxford Guide, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003 p. 611. =Acceptance in France= Shakespeare for a variety of reasons had never caught on in France, and even when his plays were performed in France in the 19th century, they were drastically altered to fit in with French tastes with for example Romeo and Juliet having a happy ending. Not until 1946 when Hamlet as translated by Andr√© Gide was performed in Paris that \\"ensured Shakespeare's elevation to cult status\\" in France. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that French intellectuals had been ‚Äúabruptly reintegrated into history‚Äù by the German occupation of 1940‚Äì44 as the old teleological history version of history with the world getting progressively better as led by France not longer held, and as such the \\"nihilist\\" and \\"chaotic\\" plays of Shakespeare finally found an audience in France. The Economist observed: \\"By the late 1950s, Shakespeare had entered the French soul. No one who has seen the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise perform his plays at the Salle Richelieu in Paris is likely to forget the special buzz in the audience, for the bard is the darling of France.\\" =In China= In the years of tentative political and economic liberalization after the death of Mao in 1976, Shakespeare became popular in China.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 pp. 51‚Äì52. The very act of putting on a play by Shakespeare, formerly condemned as a \\"bourgeois Western imperialist author\\" whom no Chinese could respect, was in and of itself an act of quiet dissent.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 51. Of all Shakespeare's plays, the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was Macbeth, as Chinese audiences saw in a play first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland a parallel with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 51. The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and furthermore, the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power-hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife, Jiang Qing.Chen, Xiaomei Oiccidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 52. Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980, one Chinese critic, Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of \\"how the greed for power finally ruined a great man\\".Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 52. Another critic, Zhao Xun wrote \\"Macbeth is the fifth Shakespearean play produced on the Chinese stage after the smashing of the Gang of Four. This play of conspiracy has always been performed at critical moments in the history of our nation\\".Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 52. Likewise, a 1982 production of King Lear was hailed by the critics as the story of \\"moral decline\\", of a story \\"when human beings' souls were so polluted that they even mistreated their aged parents\\", an allusion to the days of the Cultural Revolution when the young people serving in the Red Guard had berated, denounced, attacked and sometimes even killed their parents for failing to live up to \\"Mao Zedong thought\\".Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 54. The play's director, the Shakespearean scholar Fang Ping who had suffered during the Cultural Revolution for studying this \\"bourgeois Western imperialist\\", stated in an interview at the time that King Lear was relevant in China because King Lear, the \\"highest ruler of a monarchy\\" created a world full of cruelty and chaos where those who loved him were punished and those who did not were rewarded, a barely veiled reference to the often capricious behavior of Mao, who punished his loyal followers for no apparent reason.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 54. Cordeilia's devotion and love for her father-despite his madness, cruelty and rejection of her-is seen in China as affirming traditional Confucian values where love of the family counts above all, and for this reason, King Lear is seen in China as being a very \\"Chinese\\" play that affirms the traditional values of filial piety.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 pp. 54‚Äì55. A 1981 production of The Merchant of Venice was a hit with Chinese audiences as the play was seen promoting the theme of justice and fairness in life, with the character of Portia being especially popular as she is seen as standing for, as one critic wrote, \\"the humanist spirit of the Renaissance\\" with its striving for \\"individuality, human rights and freedom\\".Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 55. The theme of a religious conflict between a Jewish merchant vs. a Christian merchant in The Merchant of Venice is generally ignored in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice as most Chinese find do not find the theme of Jewish-Christian conflict relevant.,Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 55. Unlike in Western productions, the character of Shylock is very much an unnuanced villain in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice, being presented as a man capable only of envy, spite, greed and cruelty, a man whose actions are only motivated by his spiritual impoverishment.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 55. By contrast, in the West, Shylock is usually presented as a nuanced villain, of a man who has never held power over a Christian before, and lets that power go to his head.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 55. Another popular play, especially with dissidents under the Communist government, is Hamlet.Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 55. Hamlet, with its theme of a man trapped under a tyrannical regime is very popular with Chinese dissidents with one dissident Wu Ningkun writing about his time in internal exile between 1958‚Äì61 at a collective farm in a remote part of northern Manchuria that he understood all too well the line from the play \\"Denmark is a prison!\\"Chen, Xiaomei Occidentalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995 p. 55. =Film= That divergence between text and performance in Shakespeare continued into the new media of film. For instance, both Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet have been filmed in modern settings, sometimes with contemporary \\"updated\\" dialogue. Additionally, there were efforts (notably by the BBC) to ensure that there was a filmed or videotaped version of every Shakespeare play. The reasoning for this was educational, as many government educational initiatives recognised the need to get performative Shakespeare into the same classrooms as the read plays. =Poetry= Many English-language Modernist poets drew on Shakespeare's works, interpreting in new ways. Ezra Pound, for instance, considered the Sonnets as a kind of apprentice work, with Shakespeare learning the art of poetry through writing them. He also declared the History plays to be the true English epic. Basil Bunting rewrote the sonnets as modernist poems by simply erasing all the words he considered unnecessary. Louis Zukofsky had read all of Shakespeare's works by the time he was eleven, and his Bottom: On Shakespeare (1947) is a book-length prose poem exploring the role of the eye in the plays. In its original printing, a second volume consisting of a setting of The Tempest by the poet's wife, Celia Zukofsky was also included. Critical quotations The growth of Shakespeare's reputation is illustrated by a timeline of Shakespeare criticism, from John Dryden's \\"when he describes any thing, you more than see it, you feel it too\\" (1668) to Thomas Carlyle's estimation of Shakespeare as the \\"strongest of rallying-signs\\" (1841) for an English identity.

The size of the hole is variable, and other organs including the stomach and liver may also occur outside the baby's body. Complications may include feeding problems, prematurity, intestinal atresia, and intrauterine growth restriction. The cause is typically unknown. Rates are higher in babies born to mothers who smoke, drink alcohol, or are younger than 20 years old. Ultrasounds during pregnancy may make the diagnosis. Otherwise diagnosis occurs at birth. It differs from omphalocele in that there is no covering membrane over the intestines. Treatment involves surgery. This typically occurs shortly after birth. In those with large defects the exposed organs may be covered with a special material and slowly moved back into the abdomen. The condition affects about 4 per 10,000 newborns. Rates of the condition appear to be increasing.  Signs and symptoms  There are no signs during pregnancy. About sixty percent of infants with gastroschisis are born prematurely. At birth, the baby will have a relatively small (<4 cm) hole in the abdominal wall, usually just to the right of the belly button. Some of the intestines are usually outside the body, passing through this opening. In rare circumstances, the liver and stomach may also come through the abdominal wall. After birth these organs are directly exposed to air.  Causes  The cause of gastroschisis is not known. There may be genetic causes in some cases, and there may be environmental factors to which the mother is exposed during pregnancy. Risk factors include the mother being young, and use of alcohol or tobacco.  Pathophysiology  During the fourth week of human embryonic development, the lateral body wall folds of the embryo meet at the midline and fuse together to form the anterior body wall. However, in gastroschisis and other anterior body wall defects, this fails to occur by either one or both of the lateral body wall folds not moving properly to meet with the other and fusing together. This incomplete fusion results in a defect that allows abdominal organs to protrude through the abdominal wall, and the intestines typically herniate through the rectus abdominis muscle, lying to the right of the umbilicus. The forces responsible for the movement of the lateral body wall folds are poorly understood, and a better understanding of these forces would help to explain why gastroschisis occurs mostly to the right of the umbilicus, while other ventral body wall defects occur in the midline. At least six hypotheses have been proposed for the pathophysiology: # Failure of mesoderm to form in the body wall # Rupture of the amnion around the umbilical ring with subsequent herniation of bowel # Abnormal involution of the right umbilical vein leading to weakening of the body wall and gut herniation # Disruption of the right vitelline (yolk sac) artery with subsequent body wall damage and gut herniation # Abnormal folding of the body wall results in a ventral body wall defect through which the gut herniates # Failure to incorporate the yolk sac and related vitelline structures into the yolk sac The first hypothesis does not explain why the mesoderm defect would occur in such a specific small area. The second hypothesis does not explain the low percentage of associated abnormality compared with omphalocele. The third hypothesis was criticized due to no vascular supplement of anterior abdominal wall by umbilical vein. The fourth hypothesis was commonly accepted, but it was later shown that the right vitelline artery (right omphalomesenteric artery) did not supply the anterior abdominal wall in this area. More evidence is needed to support the fifth hypothesis. Diagnosis Gastrochisis in ultrasound: defect is right to midline In the developed world, around 90% of cases are identified during normal ultrasound screens, usually in the second trimester. Distinguished from other ventral body wall defects such as omphalocele, there is no overlying sac or peritoneum, and the defect is usually much smaller in gastroschisis. Treatment Gastroschisis requires surgical treatment to return the exposed intestines to the abdominal cavity and close the hole in the abdomen. Sometimes this is done immediately but more often the exposed organs are covered with sterile drapings, and only later is the surgery done. Affected newborns frequently require more than one surgery, as only about 10% of cases can be closed in a single surgery. Given the urgent need for surgery after birth, it is recommended that delivery occur at a facility equipped for caring for these high-risk neonates, as transfers to other facilities may increase risk of adverse outcomes. There is no evidence that cesarean deliveries lead to better outcomes for babies with gastroschisis, so cesarean delivery is only considered if there are other indications. The main cause for lengthy recovery periods is the time taken for the infant's bowel function to return to normal. After surgery infants are fed through IV fluids and gradually introduced to normal feeding.  Prognosis  If left untreated, gastroschisis is fatal to the infant; however, in adequate settings the survival rate for treated infants is 90%. Most risks of gastroschisis are related to decreased bowel function. Sometimes blood flow to the exposed organs is impaired or there is less than the normal amount of intestine. This may put infants at risk for other dangerous conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis. Also, because their intestines are exposed, infants with gastroschisis are at increased risk for infection, and must be closely monitored. After surgery a child with gastroschisis will have some degree of intestinal malrotation. About 1% of children will experience a midgut volvulus after surgery.  Epidemiology  As of 2015 the worldwide incidence was about 2 to 5 per 10 000 live births, and this number seemed to be increasing. As of 2017 the CDC estimates that about 1,871 babies are born each year in the United States with gastroschisis.

The last Deputy Commissioner of the district was Rizwan Ahmed. The old Hyderabad district included the adjoining districts of present-day Hyderabad: Matiari, Tando Allahyar and Tando Muhammad Khan. Even before that until the early 1970s the district included all the four districts mentioned above as well as the Badin district. This administrative setup was demolished by former President Pervez Musharraf in 2001 when he introduced the local body government.  Demographics  The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Hyderabad District. The population of the district was enumerated at at the 2017 Census. Combined population of these four districts (not including Badin) as per the 1998 census was 2.891M out of which 1.469M people lived in urban while the rest 1.422M people lived in the rural areas.

Software development and software engineering are the fields in which practitioners first applied the term to these project management practices, spreading to other fields. Death marches that are destined for failure usually are a result of unrealistic or overly optimistic expectations in scheduling or feature scope, and often include lack of appropriate documentation or relevant training and outside expertise that would be needed to accomplish the task successfully. The knowledge of the doomed nature of the project weighs heavily on the psyche of its participants, as if they are helplessly watching themselves and their coworkers. There may be desperate attempts to right the course of the project by asking team members to work especially grueling hours (14-hour days or 7-day weeks) or by attempting to \\"throw (enough) bodies at the problem\\", often causing burnout. The discomfort is heightened by project participants' knowledge that the failure is avoidable. It may have succeeded with competent management, such as by devoting the obviously required resources, including bringing all relevant expertise, technology, or applied science to the task rather than just whatever incomplete knowledge a few employees happened to possess.

They subsequently released cassettes of their own music on Ullrich's PF (Proboscis Funkstone) Records.\\"Music video features hot local bands\\". Kingston Whig-Standard, March 2, 1995. The band soon gained a small but loyal following. Their 1993 debut LP, Hilario, consisted of previously released material compiled from the band's self-released Darn Foul Dog, Let's Get Together, and Egrog cassettes. The album brought the Inbreds to the attention of Rheostatics, who brought the band on tour with them. The Inbreds would later reach larger audiences while touring Canada, the US, and Europe with more established rock acts of the day such as the Tragically Hip and Buffalo Tom.Michael Barclay, Ian A.D.

Kombinator also garnered the band its first Juno Award nomination, for Best Alternative Album at the Juno Awards of 1996.\\"Juno nominees reflect success of female singers\\". The Globe and Mail, February 1, 1996. Around this time the band became the object of a bidding war between Sub Pop and TAG Recordings. Because their friends in the bands Jale and The Hardship Post, who were both signed to Sub Pop, were reporting that their relationships with the label were souring, The Inbreds chose to sign with TAG. O'Neill also said the duo wouldn't sign to Sub Pop because the label wanted the duo to add a guitarist to the band. That label rereleased Kombinator in the United States,\\"Kingston duo's charm hard to deny\\". Vancouver Sun, August 17, 1995. and brought them on a tour.\\"Surprise!
