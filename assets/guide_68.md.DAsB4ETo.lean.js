The 2000 Serbian parliamentary election was held under a revised electoral system in which the entire country was counted as a single electoral division, with members elected via proportional representation. The SPO ran its own slate instead of joining a broad coalition called the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS). This proved to be a strategic error, as the SPO did not receive a sufficient number of votes to cross the electoral threshold and was not represented in the new parliament.ƒåotriƒá received the 248th position (out of 250) on the SPO's list, which was largely organized in alphabetical order. Had the SPO won parliamentary representation, he could have been selected as part of the party's parliamentary group despite his low position; the question was rendered moot by its poor performance.

History The Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) was developed as the \\"Academic Quality Improvement Project\\" beginning in 1999 by Stephen Spangehl at the Higher Learning Commission (then the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools). The project was funded by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts. The project was inspired by Dr. Spangehl's experience as an examiner for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, and sought to apply the principles of Total quality management to higher education. AQIP originally focused on 9 categories of activity that lent themselves to self-assessment and continuous improvement, improved and refined in 2008. The guidelines identified ten core principles‚ÄîFocus, Involvement, Leadership, Learning, People, Collaboration, Agility, Foresight, Information, and Integrity‚Äîthat high performing organizations use to guide their operations, and required institutions to develop their own projects to apply those principles tho their own activity and measure their success. The program took a collaborative approach with \\"Strategy Forums\\" where groups of institutions shared their insights about the \\"Action Projects\\" they undertook to address various challenges. The records of Action Projects were stored in an online network that other participants could access and use as guidance for future improvements. At the end of the review cycle institutions were responsible for preparing a \\"Systems Portfolio\\" that required them to answer specific question about processes, results, and improvements for each of the 9 AQIP categories. Modern Form AQIP is now known as the AQIP Pathway, and is one of three options that institutions accredited by the Higher Learning Commission can pursue for reaccreditation. The current director of the program is Dr. Linnea Stenson. An institution must be eligible to choose a pathway in order to elect participation in AQIP. Institutions must be accredited for ten years before they can select an optional pathway, and numerous factors can make an institution ineligible, including recent change in control, substantive change, sanction, monitoring, or if the accreditor has serious concerns about the institution's conduct or commitment to required accreditation activities.

In 2019, Dr. Zarka was selected as one of 12 torch-lighters at the annual Independence Day ceremony on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem Early life Salman Zarka was born in 1964 in Peki'in to a large Druze family. In 1982 he began his studies at the School of Medicine in Technion, Haifa, as part of Academic Reserve military program (Atuda). Military service After receiving his MD degree he started his military service which lasted over 25 years. Dr. Zarka served as a doctor in an Armored Battalion of the 401st Brigade and as the brigade's medical officer. He served as a doctor in the 36th Division (Ga'ash Formation) and as Head of the military health branch at the Chief Medical Officer headquarters. At 2008 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and was appointed as Medical Commander of the Northern Command during the tenure of Gadi Eizenkot as the commanding officer. In 2013 he was appointed as the Commander of the IDF Center for Medical Services and the Head of Health Department in the Medical Corps. In March 2013 he founded and commanded the operation of a field hospital on the Israel-Syria border for the treatment of wounded victims of the Syrian Civil War. Academic Zarka has a master's degree in epidemiology and public health from the Hebrew University, he is a graduate of the National Security College, and a has master's degree in political science and national security from the University of Haifa. Serves as a senior lecturer in the Department of Military Medicine at the Hebrew University and as a senior lecturer at the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health in the School of Public Health of Haifa University. At the last year, Dr. Zarka teaches at the Faculty of Medicine at Bar Ilan University. Dr. Zarka has two specialties: one in the field of public health and the other one in the field of medical management, in which he gained vast experience while serving as an assistant to the Director General of the Ministry of Health, Prof. Ronni Gamzu. In this capacity he led the \\"Rest in Dignity\\" program (the purpose of which was to provide dignified burial to the samples remaining at forensic pathology institute at Abu Kabir) and project of medical services upgrade across hospitals in northern Israel (Nahariya, Poria and Ziv) as part of establishment of Safed Medical School. Medical services At the time of the IDF Operation Protective Edge, during which he served as Commander of the IDF Center for Medical Services, Dr. Zarka managed the provision of medical services to the soldiers in the operation area, treatment of hospitalized soldiers and the establishment of military hospital in the Erez Crossing intended to provide assistance for the Gaza Strip citizens. In 2014, while serving as the Commander of the IDF Center for Medical Services, he suddenly decided to end his military career (although at that time he was a leading candidate for the position of Surgeon General) and to run for the position of the Director of Ziv Medical Center in Safed, which he holds as of December 2014. The beginning of his work was followed by a lawsuit filed by doctors who competed against him for the position and lost the tender. The lawsuit alleged that the Civil Service Commissioner was not authorized to approve the late tender application submitted by Dr. Zarka following his participation in Operation Protective Edge. The lawsuit was discussed at the Labour Court, where it was decided to hold a repeated tender, in which Dr. Zarka again won the position of Director of Ziv Medical Center. Throughout recent years the Ziv Medical Center prospers and enjoys a rapid growth, improving the medical services for residents of northern Israel and providing appropriate medical solutions for patients in the periphery without the need to travel long distances. Ziv hospital is facing another challenge related with the preparedness for emergency situations. During the Second Lebanon War about 1500 wounded patients were treated in the hospital - both soldiers and citizens of the state. In addition, it suffered a direct hit by a rocket. In year 2016, a Child Health Center was opened within the facility. It is located in a reinforced building, comprehensively addresses the needs of northern residents, and is designed to provide initial assistance in emergency events. Under the direction of Dr. Zarka, Ziv hospital continues to lead the humanitarian treatment of wounded in Syrian civil war. About 800 patients were treated at Ziv Medical Center from 2013 to 2016, as part of the Israeli humanitarian aid to Syrian citizens. Publications Dr. Zarka is publishing a medical book Complicated War Trauma and Care of the Wounded, based on Ziv Hospital experience. http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Health/First-Druse-to- head-an-Israeli-hospital-378770 https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319533384#aboutBook References 1964 births Living people Bar-Ilan University faculty Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty Israeli military doctors People of the Syrian Civil War University of Haifa alumni University of Haifa faculty ","title":"Salman Zarka"},{"id":"53720763","text":"Christopher Auth from the Intel Corporation of Hillsboro, OR, was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2015 for contributions to strained silicon transistor technology.

Known for his pioneering research in radio physics, Rao was a Member of Parliament of the Rajya Sabha and an elected fellow of all the three major Indian science academies viz. Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Physical Sciences in 1965.  Biography  Entrance to Andhra University B. Ramachandra Rao was born on 21 November 1922 at Yalamanchili, a small village in Visakhapatnam district of the undivided Andhra Pradesh in British India in a fisherman's family of limited financial means. After early schooling at local institutions, he did his intermediate course at Visakhapatnam before joining Andhra University for his graduate studies. It was during this time, he had the opportunity to train under Suri Bhagavantam, a known physicist, who would later go on to become the vice chancellor of Osmania University. After completing the degree of BSc (hons) in 1944 winning Sripathi Medal for standing first in the university, he obtained the degree of MSc in 1945, again with a first rank which earned him the Metcalf Medal. Subsequently, he joined Andhra University as a lecturer and simultaneously did his doctoral studies on diffraction of light by high frequency ultrasonic waves under the guidance of Bhagavantam, to secure the degree of Doctor of Science in 1949. On receiving a Commonwealth Senior Research Fellowship, Rao moved to Australia to do his post-doctoral work with David Forbes Martyn, a T. K. Sidey Medal recipient, and a Fellow of the Royal Society at his laboratory at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). At Martyn's laboratory, he worked on experimental space physics and after returning to India, he resumed his career at Andhra University where spent the rest of his academic career till his superannuation as a professor and head of the department of physics. In 1976, the Government of India appointed him as the vice chairman of the University Grants Commission and he held the post for two terms until 1982 when he was elected to the Rajya Sabha. He completed one full term as a member of parliament (1982‚Äì88) and later served as the part- time chair of the National Fisheries Advisory Board in 1989. Rao died on 24 September 2005, at the age of 82, survived by his wife and siblings.  Legacy  AQ500 SoDAR used in wind energy development and wind condition monitoring One of the principal contributions of Rao in the academic field was the establishment of a laboratory for Ionosphere and Space Research (ISRL) at the Waltair campus of Andhra University which would evolve into an advanced space science centre, and it was here, he hosted a number of researchers. He was also instrumental in introducing computer at the university. He maintained his interest in ultrasonics which he had worked on during his doctoral studies and his initial work at ISRL led to the discovery that diffraction patterns followed Bragg's Law in high frequency regions. For furthering their research, the team led by him developed novel methodologies for measuring ultrasonic velocities in liquids and solids with high precision and developed purpose- built instruments such as transmitters, receivers and oscillographs for pulse measurement, seismic sounders and satellite signal recorders. He designed a multi-frequency HF phase path radar which was the first equipment of its kind that used spaced-receiver configuration. The other equipment developed by his team included an HF phase path sounder which was a first time development, as well as an ionospheric drift recorder, a meteor radar and a SOnic Detection And Ranging system (SODAR). He and his colleagues published seven articles detailing the body of their work in ultrasonics and six of them appeared in Nature. This pioneering research on ionospheric plasma contributed to the development of HF Doppler radar, meteor radar and SODAR systems presently in use. He also carried out studies on Ionospheric dynamo region and on the horizontal winds over a sunspot cycle. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles of which many have been listed by the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences. He also edited three books, Physics of the solid state : commemoration volume to Professor S. Bhagavantam, and Bhagavantam Volume: Volume in Honour of Prof. S. Bhagavantam on the Occasion of the 60th Birthday, 14.04.1969 both festschrifts on his mentor, as well as Science, Technology and Education for Prosperity, and his work has drawn citations in books published by others. Rao, who is reported to have introduced many educational plans during his tenure as the vice-chair of the University Grants Commission of India, presided the Indian Science Congress on Man and the ocean ‚Äì resource and development of 1983 held in Tirupati. He served as the president of the National Academy of Sciences, India and the Acoustical Society of India during 1981‚Äì82. He was a member of the governing body of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research during 1977‚Äì89 and sat in the science and engineering council of the Department of Science and Technology from 1977 to 1981. He chaired the Indian National Committee for International Union of Radio Science (INCURSI) and was a member of the committees of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics for India and Tropospheric scatter communications networks. He also served as an honorary consultant to Defence Research and Development Organization.  Awards and honors  Rao received of the Sripathi Medal and Metcalf Medal of Andhra University during his college days; the university would honor him again with a doctorate (honoris causa) in 1970. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1965. The Indian National Science Academy elected him as a fellow in 1969 and he became a fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, India in 1974 and 1978 respectively. He was also a fellow of the Andhra Pradesh Academy of Sciences, Astronomical Society of India and Indian Physics Association and Acoustical Society of India. The award orations delivered by him included Professor Suri Bhagavantam oration to commemorate his 60th birthday in 1977, Sir C. V.

In the late 18th century, the farm is recorded as being in the ownership of William Street of Lincoln's Inn Fields. The house is Grade II* listed on account of its unusual plan and Renaissance fa√ßade. Architecture and description The 17th century house is described by the architectural historian John Newman as \\"remarkably little altered.\\" Its plan is \\"unusual\\", with a central service range and a hall at one end with a parlour at the other. The farm is built of rubble stone with a slate roof and brick chimney stacks. In April 2017 a programme of dendrochronological dating was commissioned by the new owners and undertaken by Oxford Dendrochronological Laboratory, this gave a felling date range of 1667-70. The trees were felled a little before 1673, so were either stockpiled for a short time, or more likely 1673 represents the date at which the new house was occupied.

It is a catadromous species that moves from freshwater to brackish water to spawn returning to freshwater as larvae. Recent research has shown that it could potentially be used as a biological control to reduce the rates of infection people living near rivers where this species occurs with schistosomiasis. Description Macrobrachium vollenhoveni is a large prawn which grows up to 189mm, but is more usually 100-150mm in length. It is generally a pale colour without any spots but with a thin dark longitudinal line on the carapace and transverse stripes across the abdomen and a thin line across the rear margin of the carapace. The third maxillipeds are bright yellow and the fingers of 2nd cheliped is dark blue with a yellow patch at the joint with the palm. Other identification features include the rostrum being equal to or shorter than the antennal scale; with the dorsal edge being convex over the eye and the tip having a short toothless portion. On the legs the second chelipeds have the Carpus shorter than palm, movable dactyls with a single large tooth at midlength of the dactyl. Distribution Macrobrachium vollenhoveni is endemic to West Africa from Senegal to Angola, as well as the islands of Bioko, S√£o Tom√© and Cape Verde. Biology Macrobrachium vollenhoveni occurs in fresh and brackish waters, including mangrove creeks and inland rivers except for acidic waters. A pre-copulatory form of ritualised behaviour which involves olfactory and tactile cues has been observed, fertilisation involves indirect sperm transfer. Mating in the genus Macrobrachium involves the male depositing spermatophores on the ventral side of the female's thorax, between the pereiopods. The female then releases eggs which pass through the spermatophores and are fertilised. After mating the females carry the eggs downstream from freshwater to the estuarine areas to spawn as the larvae must develop in saline water. As the eggs are unable to hatch at higher salinities the females migrate downstream in the rainy season when salinity in the estuarine areas has been lowered. The larvae then move back upstream into freshwater to complete their development. M. vollenhoveni is omnivorous and the major part of its diet consists of plant materials, algae, diatoms, protozoa and invertebrates. They are non-selective opportunistic feeders, feeding on plankton, especially Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. It has been described as s detritus feeder with a preference for animal remains and has been observed feeding on tadpoles and fish fry. Fisheries and Aquaculture Macrobrachium vollenhoveni is fished for using leaf and brush traps in both freshwater and brackish water environments. It is not the primary target in most fisheries which are usually targeting the related species of Macrobrachium felicinum and Macrobrachium macrobrachion, although there are reported to be full-time M. vollenhovenii fisheries in Lagos Lagoon, Nigeria at peak season. M. vollenhoveni has been assessed as being very suitable for aquaculture in numerous studies as one of the largest species in the genus Macrobrachium, because it tolerates a wide range of environments and is an omnivore. The methods of aquaculture are very similar to those used to farm the cultured species Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Studies have looked at the nutritional value of the prawns and the possible use of the rather unappetising shells as a sustainable source of meal to use as food in aquaculture systems. As at 2017, large scale aquaculture of M. vollenhoveniihas not taken off, possibly because the requirement for more saline water for hatching eggs has not been understood. Use as a biological control for schistosomiasis Macrobrachium vollenhoveni is an omnivore but larger individuals will prey on freshwater snails, including those species which act as intermediate hosts to the parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma which can infect humans and cause the chronic parasitic infection schistosomiasis,also known as bilharzia. On the Senegal River the Diama Dam was built about 50 km from the mouth of the river and blocked the access of prawns up stream of the dam to the brackish water of the estuary for breeding so these populations of prawns eventually collapsed, this in turn led to a huge increase in the rates of infection with Schistosoma of people living near the river up stream of the dam. This inferred that the loss of prawn populations may be linked to the huge increases in rates of infection with Schistosoma. with infection rates attaining 71.8% in some villages. As M. rosenbergii has been shown to be an effective predator of the snails which act as intermediate hosts to the parasites under laboratory conditions it was thought that the similar M.vollenhoveni potentially would too, and this was shown to be the case. The larger males were more effective in predating the snails so efforts were focussed on producing single sex generations which could be used to populate rivers. As these were males they would grow faster and larger, they would not tend to migrate downstream and they would stay close to where they were introduced to the river. They could also be corralled into shallow water where the snails were concentrated increasing the effectiveness of their predation. The prawns could still be harvested for food as the parasite cannot be passed to humans after being consumed by the prawns. The use of prawns shows potential in helping to control infection rates of schistosomiasis in conjunction with drugs and other biological controls such as catfish and domestic ducks.

Biography Tsin was a school teacher, principal of the Jockey Club Government Secondary School and later teacher at the Clementi Secondary School. He was the vice-president of the Hong Kong Teachers' Association in the 1960s. Tsin ran for the 1973 Urban Council election but did not received support from the Teachers' Association. He turned to the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association and later became the president of the Association. Although Tsin was nominated by the Reform Club of Hong Kong during the election, Tsin and Wong Pun-cheuk, another Reform Club candidate, fell out with Club chairman Brook Bernacchi soon after the election, in which the duo resigned from the Club in 1974. Tsin was involved in the Chinese Language Movement in 1968, which called for an official status of the Chinese language. In 1970, the government announced wage cut of the government school teachers. Tsin organised teachers to form the joint office of the Hong Kong educational organisations in protest against the government's move in which he became the convenor. Tsin also took the leading role in transforming the office was later into the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (HKPTU) in 1973, the most powerful teachers' union in Hong Kong, but resigned from the chairmanship of the preparatory committee in 1973 after being elected to the Urban Council and was replaced by Szeto Wah. In 1978, he petitioned to Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Lord Goronwy Robert and British Members of Parliament Frank Hooley and Frank Hooley on the constitutional reform in Hong Kong with other Urban Councillors Elsie Elliott and Denny Huang, but their request for reform was not met. In 1981, Tsin founded the Association for Democracy of Hong Kong in response to the government's district administration reform under the Green Paper proposal published in June 1980. In the first reformed Urban Council election in 1983, Tsin lost his seat in the Kowloon City East constituency to local leader Pao Ping-wing, with a margin of 2,603 votes, which ended his ten-year Urban Councillor service.

The cause of the accident was determined to be carbon monoxide poisoning of the flight crew due to a faulty cabin heater. Accident The flight was the first leg of a 15-day package holiday to the Costa Brava, organised by Lyons Tours. Aboard the plane were 83 passengers and 5 crew. At 10:04, the aircraft reported to air traffic control at Perpignan that all was well, visibility was good, and that they were beginning to descend. A few minutes later, the aircraft hit 9,000-foot Mount Canigou to the south-west of Perpignan. The aircraft was destroyed, and all 88 on board were killed. Aircraft The Douglas DC-4 aircraft had been built as a C-54A Skymaster for the United States Army Air Forces in 1942. It had been imported by the United Kingdom in 1960 by Starways, and Air Ferry had purchased the aircraft in 1963. The airframe had flown 42,300 hours at the time of its last maintenance check. Investigation An investigation by the French Ministry of Transport into the accident concluded that the crash was a result of a series of errors by the crew, but that their irrational behavior was caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty heater. Investigators also mentioned language difficulties between the crew and the Perpignan controller, and that radio directional finding equipment not being used to determine the aircraft's location may have aggravated the circumstances.

He became mainly known for his sculptures of New Zealand and Welsh rugby players. Born in Dunedin, the son of Francis Dunlop, who lectured in moral philosophy at the University of Otago and who was also a Presbyterian minister, he grew up on the family farm. Shona Dunlop MacTavish (1920‚Äì2019) was his younger sister. At the farm, Dunlop learned to ride proficiently and developed a love of horses that never left him, clearly visible in his later sculptures and illustrations. After the death of his father in his teens, the family moved to Europe, settling in Vienna in the mid-1930s. With the political turmoil of Central Europe, after two years they moved on to Paris. Dunlop then continued to London to study at the Royal Academy Schools, where he won the prestigious Landseer Prize. This was interrupted in 1939 when he volunteered to serve in Finland's short-lived 'Winter War', where his horse-riding abilities paid off. While trapped by World War II in Scandinavia, he attended art school in Stockholm for a year before attempting an escape on horseback via the Arctic Circle. This failed when he and a companion were arrested, but he eventually regained Britain by plane. There he joined the Royal Air Force and trained as a pilot in South Africa before flying on operations from bases in North Africa. After the war, in 1946, he moved to Sydney to join some of his family and attended Sydney Technical College. Here, in 1947, he married his teenage sweetheart from Vienna, Hilary Lennox Napier, an English dancer, and began a successful career as an illustrator.Bonar Dunlop (1916-1992) , www.janebadgerbooks.co.uk$3 million plus for a rock cabin, www.domain.com.au \\"1954: A two-bedroom, two-bathroom, Max Collard-designed beach house added to site.

Since his time in Australia he had often worked on book illustration, very much the 1950s vogue, and in the 1960s he provided new covers and internal illustrations for Ruby Ferguson's Jill books - Jill's Gymkhana, Jill's Riding Club, A Stable for Jill - and later the paperback versions of the books.Bonar Dunlop and the Piebald Question, 15 March 2013, booksandmud.blogspot.com.au Although his primary career was as an illustrator and commercial artist, his real passion was for sculpture, and in the early 1970s he became a full-time sculptor, creating sporting pieces, primarily of rugby players. His first one-man show was in London in 1975, and he subsequently exhibited at the Academy of Fine Arts in Wellington and in Dunedin. Other shows followed in Edinburgh and Wales, and he was commissioned to do numerous portraits of sports personalities for trophies and private collections.Statue of Gareth Edwards, Public Monuments & Sculpture Association, www.pmsa.org.uk Photos of the statue of Gareth Edwards, www.immortalsofbritishsport.com After living in north London, Dunlop and his wife spent the latter part of their lives between a house in Moj√°car, Spain, and Sussex, England, where he died on his 76th birthday.

Olca-Paruma is a volcanic complex in Chile. Lying on the border between Chile and Bolivia, it is formed by an east- west alignment of volcanoes. From west to east, these are Cerro Paruma, Volcan Paruma, Olca, and Mencheca or Michincha. Aside from the mines of Ujina, Rosario, and Quebrada Blanca, the area is sparsely populated. These volcanoes have erupted mainly lava flows, which descend their slopes. The volcanoes range in shape from long and narrow to short and stubby. Craters are found on the volcanoes. Eruptive activity commenced during the Pleistocene and continued during the Holocene. There is evidence of glaciation on the volcanoes, including moraines. The only historical activity of unspecified character occurred during 1865‚Äì1867; the volcano may still be a threat to Bolivia and Chile. It also features vigorous fumarolic activity and has been inspected for its geothermal energy potential.  Geomorphology and geography  Olca-Paruma forms part of the Chile-Bolivia border. The Chilean sector lies partly in the commune of Ollag√ºe, El Loa province, Antofagasta Region, and partly in the Tamarugal Province, Tarapaca Region. The Bolivian segment lies in the Potosi Department. The Estaci√≥n Yuma and the Estaci√≥n Ruqu√≠os lie at the southern foot of Olca-Paruma, along with an unpaved road. The buildings of Cercicha and Pajancha lie on the Bolivian side, at the southeastern foot. Southwest of Olca-Paruma lie various mines, including, in order of increasing distance: Ujina, Rosario, and Quebrada Blanca. Habitations in the area include Amincha, Collahuasi, Cosca, and Ollag√ºe. Olca-Paruma is relatively remote from human habitation. = Regional = Olca-Paruma belongs to the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andean Volcanic Belt, a long volcanic arc that features 44active, or potentially active, volcanoes. The most active volcano is Lascar, where a major eruption took place in 1993. Other volcanoes with recorded activity include Irruputuncu, Isluga, and San Pedro. Fumarolic activity has been recorded at Alitar, Guallatiri, Lastarria, Olca-Paruma, Ollag√ºe, Putana, and Tacora. The volcanic activity of the CVZ ultimately is caused by the Nazca Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate. Map of the region = Local = Olca-Paruma is a long volcanic complex. It is composed of the high conical Cerro Paruma (), the high Volcan Paruma (), west of Cerro Paruma, the high Olca (), west of Volcan Paruma, and the high Mencheca () volcanoes, which are aligned in an east-west direction. Mencheca is also known as Michincha. An additional centre is the high Cerro Olca Sur (). Directly west of Cerro Paruma lies Cerro Candelaria and north of it a saddle named Salle Orca, which leads north to another summit, Cerro Moro. Olca has a summit crater, and two craters are found on Volcan Paruma, plus at least twelve additional vents. Some vents have well-preserved craters and others are eroded. The volcanoes are accompanied by surge deposits formed during explosive activity. The basal diameter of the edifice is , the basal surface , and the volume of the edifice is . Lava flows reaching lengths of extend in a northerly direction from the summit crater of Olca. There appear to be older lava flows on the western side of Olca that reach lengths of and that have been buried by younger flows. Other lava flows on the northern and western sides of the volcano were erupted from vents farther west of Olca. Some fresh lava flows extend in a southeasterly direction from Volcan Paruma, reaching in length. They are long and wide and do not branch. Another much shorter lava flow with flow ridges lies east of Volcan Paruma's summit. The basement is formed by the Miocene- Pliocene age Ujina ignimbrite. The basement around Olca volcano lies at an elevation of about . The Salar de Laguani sits at the eastern foot of Olca- Paruma and the Salar de la Laguna at its northern foot. = Hydrology = The southern side of the complex shows some traces of past glaciation in the form of two different sets of apron-like moraines, one at an elevation of and the other at ; even lower moraines have been found and valley glaciers formed on Paruma. Some lower lava flows show evidence of heavy glaciation. At least one warm spring is located at the foot of Olca-Paruma. The eastern slopes drain into the Salar de Laguani, the northern slopes into the Salar de la Laguna, and the southwestern slopes into the Salar Michincha. On the southeastern side the Rio Pajancha originates on Olca-Paruma's slopes, while the southern slope drains into the Salar de Alconcha through the Quebrada Churchicha and Quebrada Juchuchurchicha. = Composition = Lava flows contain andesite and dacite of relatively uniform composition, the former containing amphibole. The morphology of the two long lava flows from Volcan Paruma implies that they were formed by lavas more mafic than is typical for the region, perhaps by andesite-andesite. Fumarolic alteration is widespread on the volcanic complex, being conspicuous on the ridge between Olca and Volcan Paruma and on the northern and southeastern flanks. Sulfur is present on the volcano, mainly around Olca, and was mined into the 1980s. Sulfur mines on the Bolivian side include Mina Carlota between Olca and Paruma and Mina Tres Rayas on Olca.  Fumarolic activity  The lava dome in the main crater of Olca is fumarolically active, with the activity occurring over a long elliptical fumarole field. Paruma volcano also shows fumarolic activity. Additional reports claim that vapours emanate from yellow pits on the western side. The fumarolic activity at Olca-Paruma forms clouds that are visible over large distances. Measurements have yielded sulfur dioxide concentrations of 35 ppm over the area. Ground temperatures in the fumarole fields is about . Satellite observation has shown temperature anomalies reaching , potentially caused by the fumarolic activity. Fumarole gases in Olca appear to be influenced by hydrothermal components rather than magmatic ones, including high methane concentrations and overall high carbon/sulfur ratios. Conversely, water in the fumaroles appears to be roughly equally of magmatic and meteoric origin, and the carbon dioxide is almost entirely of non-mantle origin, and predominantly from limestone. Argon isotope data indicate a moderately radiogenic origin for the argon, and a substantial amount of helium seems to have been added by the crust. Ultimately, the fumarolic gases of Olca appear to form in a hydrothermal system above magma, at high temperatures of and with significant contributions from the magma itself, suggesting that there is still liquid magma beneath Olca-Paruma with a resulting risk of future volcanic activity. Olca-Paruma has been investigated as a potential source of geothermal energy. Drilling to depths less than has demonstrated the existence of warm groundwater beneath a clay layer, with temperatures of . A layer of high electrical conductivity has been found at depths of between and beneath Olca- Paruma. This conductive zone extends to Irruputuncu and appears to be part of a general high conductivity area associated with the volcanic arc.  Eruption history  The Olca-Paruma complex has been active since 80,000 years before present. Volcan Paruma generated lava flows during the Holocene, and lava flows of Volcan Paruma likewise display a fresh appearance, being clearly post-glacial. Other research has claimed that lava flows on the western side of Olca were erupted during the Pleistocene and that others seem to be much older. The appearance of the edifices suggest that volcanic activity migrated east over time, although validation of the proposed older dates would contradict this. Cerro Paruma is of pre-Holocene age. Potassium‚Äìargon dating has yielded ages of 430,000¬± 500,000 from distal lava flows west of Olca and 5,000¬± 350,000 from lava flows closer to the summit of Olca on its southwestern slope; both are considered unreliable. More recent volcanic activity was phreatic and phreatomagmatic and formed the summit craters. The occurrence of recent volcanic activity and its location on the Olca-Paruma complex is unclear. An unconfirmed flank eruption occurred in 1865‚Äì1867 on Olca; it may have occurred on Volcan Paruma, however. Fumarolic activity has been ongoing for over sixty years, and may have spiked in November 1989 ‚Äì March 1990 when seismic and fumarolic activity occurred at the volcano. During that instance, strong fumarolic activity was observed on 13November 1989 from Ujina, and seismic activity was reported in mid-March of the subsequent year. This fumarolic activity occurred in coincidence with earthquakes at Iquique on the coast. = Seismic activity = Three potential seismic swarms occurred in 2010: on 6May, 2July and 7September. A cluster of seismic activity has been observed between Olca-Paruma and Irruputuncu. An ANDIVOLC seismometer array lies at Olca-Paruma, with over six seismometers in total around the volcano. Between 2010‚Äì2011, these seismometers observed earthquake activity ranging from a mean of 1.6 to a maximum of 10 earthquakes per day, most of which have, however, been linked to mining activity. = Hazards = As one of Bolivia's two historically active volcanoes (the other being Irruputuncu), Olca-Paruma is considered a possible volcanic threat. , however, Bolivia does not have any active volcano monitoring on Olca-Paruma. The Chilean SERNAGEOMIN considers it a middle-to-low hazard volcano, the 46th most dangerous volcano of Chile and publishes a volcano hazard level for the volcano. A hazard map has also been published.

In the latter capacity he played a leading role in the affairs of the Principality of Achaea. Biography =Early life and career= He was a son of Giovanni Foscari, a member of the noble Foscari family. Nothing is known about his early life, except that he studied civil and canon law in the University of Padua, where he may also have taught as a professor for a time. He chose an ecclesiastical career, and on 19 August 1365 the Venetian Senate recommended him for the position of Latin Archbishop of Patras in the Morea in southern Greece. The Archbishop of Patras was a powerful figure in Latin Greece: he was not only the pre-eminent Catholic see of the Morea, but also, having acquired the secular barony of Patras in and added its 24 fiefs to his own eight, the most important of the Principality of Achaea's feudatories. From the time of Archbishop William Frangipani (1317‚Äì1337) in particular, Patras enjoyed close relations with Venice and acted practically independent from the Prince. When the Angevin bailli tried to impose his authority over the city shortly after, the intervention of the Pope resulted in the effective independence of the Archbishop from Achaea and his direct subordination to the Pope. For the remainder of the century, the Archbishops of Patras played an active role in the intrigues and feuds of the Principality, and in turn the contending families often tried to place one of their own scions on the archiepiscopal throne. Foscari lost the position to Angelo I Acciaioli, a relative of the previous incumbent, John III Acciaioli, and adoptive son of the grand seneschal Niccol√≤ Acciaioli, whose family was spreading its influence in the Morea at this time. On 24 April 1366, after another recommendation of the Senate to the Pope, he was chosen instead as bishop of the See of Coron, a Venetian colony in the southwestern Morea. He remained at Coron for about a year, before returning to Venice, where on 7 May 1367 he assumed the post of Bishop of Castello. =Bishop of Castello= As Bishop of Castello (in effect the residing bishop of Venice), he entered into a protracted conflict with the authorities of the Republic of Venice over the so-called \\"death tax\\", a tithe over a deceased person's property payable to the Church by his relatives. The controversy was simmering since the outbreak of the Black Death in 1348, but Foscari fanned it anew. The civil authorities in Venice vehemently opposed the tithe, and forbade it outright on 29 August 1368, leading to a complete breakdown of relations between the Republic and the Church, as Popes Urban V and Gregory XI backed Foscari. An attempt by his father, Giovanni, to mediate between the two sides, only resulted in the Senate voting to give him an ultimatum of three months, under pain of perpetual banishment for him and his sons and the confiscation of all his property, to bring his son to heel. The conflict was only resolved in 1377, by which time Paolo Foscari had been transferred (on 26 November 1375) to the Archbishopric of Patras. =Archbishop of Patras= From his new post Paolo played a leading role in the affairs of the Latin states of southern Greece. In 1376 or 1377, the bailli of the Principality of Achaea, Centurione I Zaccaria, died, and Foscari was chosen to replace him by Queen Joanna I of Naples. He did not remain long in the post, however; desiring to place Achaea in hands more capable of defending it, in summer 1376 Queen Joanna sold the principality for five years to the Knights Hospitaller, and (at the latest in summer 1377) sent Daniel del Caretto to the Morea as her new bailli, to oversee the transfer of power. The newly elected Grand master of the Hospitallers, Juan Fern√°ndez de Heredia, arrived in the Morea in late 1377. Foscari lent him troops for an expedition against Lepanto, held by the Albanian chieftain John Spata; the campaign was a failure, however, as Heredia was taken prisoner by Spata, sold to the Turks, and had to be ransomed. By 1380, Lepanto too was back in Albanian hands, and in 1381, the Hospitallers returned the government of the Principality of Achaea to Queen Joanna. The failure of the Hospitaller enterprise inaugurated a period of turmoil for Achaea, complicated by the arrival of the mercenary Navarrese Company and the effects of the Western Schism between Pope Urban VI and Antipope Clement VII. Queen Joanna having recognized Clement VII, she was deposed and killed by Charles III, who was supported by Urban VI. Achaea passed under the control of titular Latin Emperor James of Baux, who appointed the leader of the Navarrese Company, Mahiot de Coquerel, as his bailli. When James died in 1383, Mahiot recognized Charles III as suzerain. Foscari remained loyal to Urban VI; as a result, on 26 September 1384 he was declared deposed by Clement VII, however without any practical consequences to his position. In the same year, he was sent as papal envoy to reconcile the local Orthodox Church of Thessalonica, which was being besieged by the Ottoman Turks. In early 1386, Charles III died, after having fallen out with Urban VI, who had declared him deposed. As a result, Urban VI confiscated the Principality of Achaea and on 6 September 1387, Foscari was appointed vicar-general on behalf of the Pope, and authorized to hire the Navarrese Company on his own account. The Pope envisioned to use the Navarrese to wage war on the Greeks of the Despotate of the Morea, and at the same stroke find for them employment and lands beyond those of the Principality of Achaea. In the event,the title was an empty formality, and real power in the principality remained with the Navarrese Company and its leaders. Foscari's role was more as an agent of Venice in the Morea, in whose affairs the Republic showed an ever-growing interest, and where they sought to expand their territory; thus in 1388, the Venetians acquired the lordship of Argos and Nauplia in the northeastern Morea. For this purpose, Foscari continued to receive soldiers and arms from Venice to support his position. In the meantime, the pretenders to the Principality multiplied: Mary of Blois sold the Principality again to the Hospitallers on behalf of her son, Louis II of Anjou, but the sale was disputed by another rival, Amadeus of Piedmont, who succeeded in getting Clement VII to annul it. Amadeus made treaties with Venice, the Navarrese, the Greek Despot of the Morea, and Nerio I Acciaioli, but in the event, the death of his cousin Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1391 meant that he never embarked for Greece. Likewise another pretender, Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, who might have rallied the Principality behind him, was caught up in the French expedition against the Barbary pirates in 1390 and abandoned his plans. The long interregnum lasted until 1396, when Mahiot's successor, Pedro de San Superano, received recognition as hereditary Prince of Achaea from King Ladislaus of Naples. Throughout the period, Foscari continued to promote Venetian interests in the Morea: on 27 February 1393, a secret resolution of the Venetian Senate instructed Foscari to seek an alliance with Nerio Acciaioli and the Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos, against the Navarrese Company. Foscari died sometime after that, but before 7 April 1394, when the See of Patras is reported as vacant.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the 294th fought in the Leningrad area until May 1943. The division served with the 52nd Army for most of the rest of the war until its redesignation in the summer of 1945.  History  The 294th began forming on 10 July 1941 at Lipetsk, part of the Orel Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 857th, 859th, and 861st Rifle Regiments, as well as the 849th Artillery Regiment and the 565th Sapper Battalion. After spending two months forming, the division was sent north to the Leningrad Front's 54th Army in late September. The 294th held positions east of the city in the Volkhov River area until May 1942 as part of the 8th Army or the 54th Army. In May 1943, the 294th was transferred to the 52nd Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. It would remain part of the 52nd Army for most of the rest of the war. In August, the division was sent to the front with the army in the Voronezh Front, then transferred to the 2nd Ukrainian Front in October. From September 1944, the 294th was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for a few weeks, and the 52nd Army moved north to the 1st Ukrainian Front. During March and April the 294th was briefly transferred to the 6th Army, but soon transferred back to the 52nd Army, serving in its 48th Rifle Corps. Soon after the end of the war, the 294th was relocated to Yavoriv in western Ukraine, along with the rest of the 52nd Army. On 10 July, the 294th was redesignated as the recently disbanded 24th Rifle Division. This meant that the new division's subunits were renumbered to the subunits of old 24th and it also inherited the previous division's honorifics.

She was one of the first important concert pianists emerging from the Romanian piano school, and a distinguished piano pedagogue.Angela Fogg wrote in Piano Journal No.84, 2007: \\"Silvia Serbescu (1903-1965) was one of the great Romanian pianists of the twentieth century‚Ä¶She was also a leading teacher at the Bucharest Conservatoire inspiring a generation of Romanian pianists.\\" Her interpretations of Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev and Debussy were memorable. From 1948 until 1965 she was a piano professor at the Bucharest Music Conservatory. Biography Silvia »òerbescu was born to a family dedicated to intellectual pursuits. Her father, Gheorghe Chelaru, was a professor of Latin, Greek and Romanian at the elite Gheorghe Lazar secondary school in Bucharest, who composed didactic manuals of Romanian language and literature for all degrees. He also was the preceptor of King Ferdinand and Queen Maria‚Äôs children Nicholas and Maria. Her mother, Eliza Bunescu, was the daughter of Ioan BunescuViorel Cosma, 1970, p. 95. and granddaughter of Gheorghe Ionescu,Viorel Cosma, 1989, p. 233.Viorel Cosma, 2001, p. 126‚Äì127. both notable composers of choral music. She started her musical studies at the Bucharest Royal Academy of Music ‚Äì piano with Constan»õa Erbiceanu (a disciple of Carl Reinecke, Max Reger and Moritz Moszkowski, and one of the founders of the Romanian piano school), harmony and counterpoint with Dumitru Georgescu Kiriac and Alfonso Castaldi, graduating at the same time the Mathematics Faculty of the University of Bucharest. Further in Paris, at the √âcole Normale de Musique, she studied with Lazare L√©vy and Alfred Cortot and graduated with highest honors and a ‚Äúlicence de concert‚Äù.Alfred Cortot wrote on her concert diploma: ‚ÄúThe undersigned certifies that Mrs. Chelaru-»òerbescu‚Äôs talent and artistic dispositions highly justify the benevolent support of the Romanian Government.‚Äù (‚ÄúJe, soussign√©, certifie que le talent et les dispositions artistiques de Mme Chelaru-»òerbescu justifient hautement le bienveillant appui du Gouvernement Roumain.‚Äù) Her debut in Bucharest in 1928, with Liszt's Piano Concerto nr. 1, and a recital one year later, was perceived as sensational. George Breazul wrote: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Silvia Serbescu steps into the Romanian musical life, best honouring our musical aspirations‚Äù.In Romanian newspaper Cuv√¢ntul, 1929. Constan»õa Erbiceanu considered Silvia Serbescu‚Äôs art as ‚Äúa synthesis of masculine thinking and feminine sensitivity‚Äù. Silvia‚Äôs large and expressive hands similar to Clara Schumann‚Äôs,The moulding of Clara's hands is displayed at the Schumann house in Zwickau, could be the anatomic clue to the ‚Äúmonumental character of her interpretations, the sense of space, of wide, open horizons‚Äù mentioned by the musicologist Iosif Sava when he tried to characterize Silvia‚Äôs pianistic style.Sava and »òerbescu, p. 96. In addition, a genuine, existential interpretative involvement in Silvia »òerbescu‚Äôs playing may explain the powerful impact she had on her audience.Pianist and musicologist Samir Golescu wrote, that Silvia »òerbescu was particularly remarkable in her performance of the Rachmaninoff Rhapsody, as if her life was depending on it!; in All about Muzicescu. Silvia »òerbescu performed in France, Italy, Poland, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, with renowned conductors as George Georgescu, Ionel Perlea, Constantin Silvestri, Sergiu Comissiona, Ernest Ansermet, Nikolai Anosov, Aleksandr Gauk, Vaclav Neumann, Paavo Berglund and many others.Sava & »òerbescu, 121-136; Between 1955-1957 she was appointed soloist of the Bucharest ‚ÄúGeorge Enescu‚Äù Philharmonic, with which she performed in Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.Sava and »òerbescu, p. 72. One of the highlights of her career was the 1962 series of recitals commemorating the centennial of Claude Debussy‚Äôs birth, playing the two books of the 24 Preludes.Sava and »òerbescu, p. 135‚Äì136. She also collaborated in chamber music recitals with George Enescu, whose autograph on the programme of their December 29, 1942 recital reads: ‚ÄúTo my remarkable partner of this evening, with admiration and respect‚Äù.Sava and »òerbescu, p. 64‚Äì65.

In a tribute to her outstanding musical and human qualities, Iosif Sava called her ‚Äúone of the most beloved teachers‚Äù of the Bucharest Music Conservatory.Constantin Ionescu-Vovu, one of Silvia »òerbescu‚Äôs students, noted: ‚ÄúPiano pedagogy is not only a problem of technique but also of psychology, because shaping a young artist requires not only competent guidance, but also loving support, a subtle balance between severity and tolerance, parameters within which she excelled like few others‚Äù. A bust of Silvia »òerbescu by Gheorghe D. Anghel nowadays greets new generations of students in the main hall of the Bucharest University of Music.Coman, p. 153.

Gusfield is known for his research in combinatorial optimization and computational biology. Education Gusfield received his undergraduate degree in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973, his Master of Science degree in computer science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1975, and his PhD in Engineering Science from Berkeley in 1980; his doctoral advisor was Richard Karp. Career and research Gusfield joined the faculty at Yale University in Computer Science in 1980, and left in 1986 to join the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis as an associate professor. Gusfield was made Professor of Computer Science in 1992 and served as the chair of the Department of Computer Science at UC Davis from 2000 to 2004. Gusfield was named distinguished professor in 2016, which is the highest campus-wide rank at the University of California at Davis. Gusfield's early work was in combinatorial optimization and its real-world application. One of his early major results was in network flow, where he presented a simple technique to convert any network flow algorithm to one that builds a Gomory-Hu tree, using only five added lines of pseudo-code.Gusfield. Very Simple Methods for All Pairs Network Flow Analysis. SIAM J. Comput. 1990 Another contribution was in stable matching, where he contributed to a polynomial-time algorithmR.W. Irving, P. Leather, and D. Gusfield, \\"An efficient algorithm for the \\"optimal\\" stable marriage\\", Journal of the ACM, Vol. 34 Issue 3, July 1987, Pages 532-543 for the Egalitarian Stable Marriage Problem, proposed by Donald Knuth. Gusfield's work on stable marriage resulted in the book, co- authored with Robert Irving, The Stable Marriage Problem: Structure and Algorithms. Starting in 1984, Gusfield branched out into computational biology, making Gusfield one of the first computer scientists to work in this field. His first result in computational biology was written in the Yale Technical Report The Steiner-Tree Problem in Phylogeny, which has never been published in a journal. His first published paper in computational biology, \\"Efficient Algorithms for Inferring Evolutionary History\\", was initially published as a technical report in 1988, and was subsequently was published in the journal Networks;D. Gusfield, \\"Efficient algorithms for inferring evolutionary trees\\", Networks 1991 this paper is now the most cited of Gusfield's papers. Gusfield's 1993 paper on multiple sequence alignmentD. Gusfield, \\"Efficient Methods for Multiple Sequence Alignment with Guaranteed Error Bounds\\", Bulletin on Mathematical Biology, Vol. 55, No. 1, 141-154, 1993 is the first publication indexed in PubMed under \\"computational biology\\". Gusfield's impact on the early days of Computer Science research in algorithmic computational biology is substantial. He was a member of the United States Department of Energy Human Genome Research Program Panel in 1991, and a member of the steering committee for the Rutgers-Princeton DIMACS center special year on Mathematical Support for Molecular Biology from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, he co-organized the Dagstuhl Conference on Molecular Bioinformatics. He has been a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Computational Biology since its inception in 1996. At the University of California at Davis, he was part of a three-person group that proposed the development of the UC Davis Genomics Center, and served as a member of the Genomics Center Steering Committee (1999‚Äì2003), and helped to build an interdisciplinary community of biologists and computer scientists working together on genomics problems. Finally, in 2004, Gusfield helped propose the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), one of the few journals specifically oriented towards computer science and mathematical researchers working in computational biology. He served as its founding editor in chief until 2009, and later as chair of the TCBB Steering Committee. He was more recently an invited visiting scientist at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley during two of its semester-long programs (first on Evolution, and later on Algorithmic Challenges in Genomics). In addition, Gusfield has been the PhD advisor or postdoctoral mentor for many well known computer scientists working in computational biology, including Prof. Oliver Eulenstein (Iowa State University), Dr. Paul Horton (Tokyo), Prof. Ming-Yang Kao (Northwestern University), Prof. John Kececioglu (Arizona), Prof. Yun S. Song (UC Berkeley and Univ. of Pennsylvania), Prof. R. Ravi (CMU), Prof. Jens Stoye (Bielefeld), Prof. Lusheng Wang (City University of Hong Kong), and Prof. Yufeng Wu (U. Connecticut).

It was designed by Ern≈ë Rubik, the father of the designer of the Rubik's Cube. Design Ern≈ë Rubik was a co-founder and the chief designer of the Aero-Ever aircraft company of Esztergom, Hungary, which was formed in 1938. He started design of the R-18 in 1944, inspired by the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, aiming for a smaller, lighter version, which would serve both as a glider tug and a STOL utility aircraft, to carry engineers and spares to service aircraft at other airports. The aircraft has a high wing braced by V-struts, with fixed leading-edge slots and retractable camber-changing flaps. The fuselage is of mixed construction with two side-by-side seats, with an optional third seat behind them. It has a conventional braced tailplane and a taildragger undercarriage with divided axle long-stroke oleo legs for the main gear, and a fixed tailwheel. Development Construction started in 1946, and the first flight of the prototype, the R-18a, c/n E-524, was on 18 May 1949. It was powered by a Walter Major 4-I four-cylinder inline engine of driving a two-bladed wooden propeller. The aircraft was well received, and was used, for a time, by the Hungarian Air Force, registered 1-002, but was soon replaced and transferred to a flying club, registered HA-RUA. The second aircraft, the R-18b, c/n E-525, registered HA-RUB, had a widened rear fuselage to make the occupant of the third seat more comfortable. It flew from 1949 to 1954 when it crashed. The third and subsequent aircraft, designated R-18c, c/n E-761, registered HA-RUC, had a Walter Minor 6-III six-cylinder engine of , which extended the fuselage length to . The cabin windows and doors were slightly redesigned, and the third seat was replaced by a fuel tank. Because of problems with the Walter Minor in-line engines, all surviving R-18s were converted to licence-built Shvetsov M-11D five-cylinder radial engines of , or M-11FR engines of leading to a reduced fuselage length of . The conversion work was done by the Central Experimental Plant at Alag, between 1955 and 1958. Construction of a metal version, the R-28 Metal-Kanya, was started but was not completed. Operational history The first three aircraft were considered prototypes, and they were followed by six production aircraft, all designated R-18c and built in 1953-54. They were registered HA-RUD to HA-RUI. One aircraft was fitted with skis for winter use. They continued in use until 1966 by which time all aircraft except two had crashed and/or been scrapped or withdrawn from use. The R-18a crashed in 1949 and was subsequently used as an instructional airframe. Survivors HA-RUG on display restored with an inline engine. Two aircraft survive: * HA-RUF, c/n E-778, was withdrawn from use in 1966 but was restored to flying condition in 2012 by the Goldtimer Foundation, and is based at Buda√∂rs Airport, Budapest. * HA-RUG, c/n E-779, was withdrawn from use in 1966, and was placed on display in the Hungarian Technical and Transportation Museum in Budapest, but the building was demolished in 2016 and the current status of the aircraft is unknown.

He is an MSU Foundation Professor of Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University. Liu was named Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2015 for contributions to sensor networks and Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2015 for contributions to wireless sensor networks and systems. He is the Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Sensor Network and is the Honorary Chair of the ACM China Council.  Biography  Yunhao Liu received his B.S. degree from Automation Department at Tsinghua University in 1995, an M.A. degree from Graduate School of Translation and Interpreting at Beijing Foreign Studies University in 1997, and an M.S. and Ph.D. degree from Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University in 2003 and 2004. From 2004 to 2011, he was Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Postgraduate Director in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). He was Professor in School of Information Science and Technology at Tsinghua University 2011 through 2013, and he served as Chang Jiang Professor and the Dean of School of Software, Tsinghua University, 2013 to 2017. From 2018, he joined MSU and now serves as MSU Foundation Professor, and from 2018 to 2019, he served as chairperson designee in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University.  Honors and Awards  Yunhao received Hong Kong Best Innovation & Research Grand Award for building the world's earliest Coal Mine Surveillance with Wireless Sensor Networks in 2007. He received the First Class Ministry of Education Nature Science Award for Location and Localizability study in wireless networks in 2010. In 2011, Liu was awarded the State Natural Science Award for his contribution to wireless localization theory and practice. In the same year, he also received one of the five Distinguished Young Scholar Awards in Computer Science by National Natural Science Foundation of China. In 2013, Liu was named the ACM Presidential Award for his contribution to spreading the word and shared the value that ACM offers to China's vast computing community. In 2014, the 20th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (ACM MobiCom) awards the best paper award to Liu's group for their paper Tagoram: Real-Time Tracking of Mobile RFID Tags to High Precision Using COTS Devices. Yunhao and his students designed and developed Tagoram, and successfully deployed this system in Terminal One, Beijing Capital International Airport and Sanya Phoenix International Airport. The prototype ran over a year and consumed 110,000 RFID tags involving 53 destination airports, 93 airlines, and 1,094 flights. Based on the observation that the tag diversity is the key to the localization performance, they designed and implemented Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) localization scheme, which successfully eliminated the impact of tag diversity on the localization accuracy, and improved the localization performance to millimeter-level, which was 40 times better than the state-of- the-art. The Tagoram system also won the Gold Award in Soft China Forum 2013, which is the highest honor in Chinese Software industry. It was the first time that the conference awards its highest award to an Asian institution. In 2015, Liu was named Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions to sensor networks, and Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for contributions to wireless sensor networks and systems. MobiCom 2014 Best paper award In 2016, Liu was awarded the IOT Young Achievement Award for his contribution to the Internet of Things by China Computer Federation.

Malik has worked primarily on the development of high frequency semiconductor device and photovoltaic technologies since the early 1980s. He studied under Lester Eastman at Cornell University. In 2015 he was awarded the status of Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  Early Years  Roger John Malik was born in New Hyde Park, New York on August 3, 1954, one of four children. Malik attended the New Hyde Park Memorial High School. From a young age, Roger had an innate curiosity about how things worked. In elementary school he reviewed college chemistry and physics textbooks and conducted experiments in his basement with a chemistry set. He studied the electronic circuits in radios, hi-fidelity stereo equipment, and TVs. Upon the recommendations of his high school math and science teachers, Malik applied and was admitted to the Columbia University Science Honors Program. He attended courses on Fortran computer programming and on laser technology (a recent development at the time) at Columbia University on Saturday mornings during his senior year of high school. These courses cemented his desire to study engineering in college.  Education and Early Career  Malik studied electrical engineering at Stony Brook University, graduating with a bachelor of engineering degree with high honors in 1976. Experiments for his senior design project were conducted in the laboratory of Prof. George W. Stroke, a pioneer is laser holography. Roger proposed and demonstrated the storage and retrieval of multiple images contained within a single hologram using spatial Fourier Transform analysis. During his junior and senior years, he worked as an intern for Prof. Franklin F.Y. Wang of the Stony Brook Materials Science Department where he performed research on high breakdown voltage, dielectric coatings on silicon power diodes. This was his introduction to semiconductor properties and their underlying device physics. Roger was admitted to Cornell University and was awarded a Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1979. Malik joined the Army Research Lab at Fort Monmouth and began doctoral research under Lester Eastman, also at Cornell University. He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Electrical Engineering in 1981. Roger pioneered the concept of Planar Doped Barrier (PDB) diodes and their use in microwave detector and mixer circuits. PDB diodes are unipolar, rectifying diodes typically grown in Gallium arsenide by the precision growth technology of Molecular-beam epitaxy. The PDB diode structure consists of an n-i-p-i-n doping profile in which the ultra-thin (<10nm) p-doped layer is fully depleted inside the intrinsic layer. This results in a triangular barrier in the electron conduction band wherein the barrier height and degree of asymmetry in the rectifying I-V characteristics are fully designable parameters by varying the p-layer charge and position within the intrinsic layer. Malik invented the PDB diodes during his Ph.D. thesis work conducted at the US Army Electronics Research Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, NJ. The PDB patent was subsequently licensed by the US Army to Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent Technologies) and has been in volume production for over 30 years. Roger‚Äôs work inspired other researchers to invent new types of semiconductor devices using the PDB as a building block. Semiconductor devices including microwave detectors and mixer diodes, subharmonic mixers, RF power limiters, modulated barrier photo-detectors, transferred electron oscillators, vertical-gated FETs, optically triggered thyristors, and hot electron ballistic transistors have all been realized using PDB rectifying barriers in the device design. Malik is sole inventor on the first patent on PDB technology, US patent #4,410,902, Roger. J. Malik, Planar Doped Barrier Semiconductor Device [10/18/1983].  Career Development  Upon graduation from Cornell, Malik took a position at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ. He and his team built upon the Nobel Prize winning work of Herbert Kroemer, who proposed graded band-gap base GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors for high frequency amplifiers. This work led to widespread commercialization of GaAs transistor amplifiers for mobile phone applications. While at Bell Labs, Malik invented the use of Carbon acceptor doping in GaAs devices. He demonstrated that Carbon was non-diffusing in the GaAs lattice due to strong tetrahedral bonding of Carbon substituting on the As cites. This greatly improved the long-term reliability of GaAs devices for use in high power GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor amplifiers, InGaAs high power lasers for optical communication systems, and in GaAs multi-junction solar cells used in satellite power systems. During his tenure at Bell Labs, he was selected to be a Bell Laboratories Visiting Professor at the Research Center for Advanced Studies (RCAST), at the University of Tokyo. During his stay in Japan, he presented invited lectures and visited over 20 universities and industrial research laboratories engaged in research on compound semiconductor devices. After 15 years at Bell Labs, Roger founded RJM Semiconductor LLC, a small business that performed contract work for DOD and industry. RJM Semiconductor was awarded government Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracts to further develop Carbon-doped GaAs HBTs for the Air Force, Carbon-doped InP mm- wave HBTs for NASA, GaAs-based MOS transistors for DARPA, and Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) for the Air Force. RJM Semiconductor also developed linear metal evaporation sources for companies in the solar industry (EPV Solar and First Solar) for the inline deposition of CuInGaSe2 thin film solar cells on glass substrates. Malik made other significant contributions in the area of compound semiconductor devices and materials growth that include high frequency GaAs and InP HBTs amplifiers and digital circuits, GaAs HBTs with base surface passivation for improved reliability, Quantum Well Intersubband Photodetectors (QWIPs), quantum well lasers, LEDs, and infrared photodetectors. Malik‚Äôs recent work has focused on research in the growth and characterization of CuInGaSe2 and CdTe thin film solar cells. Malik is currently developing proprietary linear thermal evaporation sources and gas doping techniques aimed towards improving the efficiency and yields of thin film solar cell modules. Publications in which Malik is a co-author have been cited over 6800 times in technical publications. Malik has an h-index of 41. Malik has 20 issued US patents.  Honors and Awards  Roger was named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2015 for his contributions to heterojunction compound semiconductor materials and devices.

The 295th's first formation was formed in the summer of 1941 and destroyed within months during the Battle of Kiev. Reformed in October, the 295th fought in the North Caucasus, the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, Poland, and Germany during the rest of the war. The 295th was downsized into a brigade after the end of the war and was relocated to the North Caucasus. It was reformed from the brigade in 1953 and renumbered in 1955.  History  = First Formation = The 295th began forming on 10 July 1941 at Chuguyev in the Kharkov Military District, just east of Kharkov. Its basic order of battle included the 1038th, 1040th, and the 1042nd Rifle Regiments, the 819th Artillery Regiment, the 563rd Sapper Battalion, and the 352nd Reconnaissance Company. In early August, the division was moved west to the Southwestern Front and assigned to the 37th Army. By 24 August it was defending the city of Kiev itself. On 7 September the 295th was relocated north and became part of the 5th Army, which had retreated across the Pripyat River and the Dnieper to cover the northern flank of the Soviet troops at Kiev. The 1042nd Regiment was detached to the 40th Army and as a result was not trapped in the Kiev pocket with the rest of the division, and survived as a separate regiment. The main forces of the 295th were destroyed in the Kiev pocket in late September, and it was officially disbanded on 30 September. = Second Formation = The division began reforming on 1 October 1941 in the Kursk area, part of the Southwestern Front, with the same basic order of battle as the first formation. It was immediately assigned to the 21st Army, but by mid-November was part of the Southern Front's newly reformed 37th Army. In June 1942, the division and its army retreated into the Caucasus in the face of the German offensive, Case Blue, and became part of the North Caucasian Front. From August, the division and 37th Army defended positions along the Terek River and in the Mozdok area as part of the North Group of the Transcaucasian Front. After the beginning of the German retreat from the Caucasus in late 1942, the 37th Army pursued, and the 295th participated in the recapture of Armavir on 24 January 1943. Between June and August, the division was part of the 58th Army of the North Caucasus Front. In September it was transferred to the Southern Front's 2nd Guards Army. The Southern Front became 4th Ukrainian Front on 20 October. While serving with the 2nd Guards Army, the 295th was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and the honorific \\"Kherson\\" for recapturing Kherson. In March 1944, the 295th was transferred to the 3rd Ukrainian Front's 5th Shock Army, with which it remained for the remainder of the war. The division fought in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive in the summer of 1944 and after its end in September the 5th Shock Army was relocated north to become part of the 1st Belorussian Front. From October to the end of the war the 295th was part of the 32nd Rifle Corps in the army. By February 1945, its anti-tank unit was the 65th SU Battalion, which had 12 SU-76 self-propelled guns. Postwar, the 295th was initially part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany with the 32nd Rifle Corps in the summer of 1945. However, it was soon relocated to Stavropol in the North Caucasus Military District with the 23rd Rifle Corps, where it became the 30th Separate Rifle Brigade in 1946. In October 1953, the brigade was upgraded into the 295th Rifle Division. In 1955 it was renumbered the 49th Rifle Division.

Deutsche Bahn classifies it as a category 5 station and it has five platforms. The station is located in the area of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe transport association, KVV) and it belongs to fare zone 540. Since 2001, transitional tickets of the Verkehrsverbundes Rhein-Neckar (VRN) are also accepted. The address of the station is Bahnhofstra√üe 44. It was opened on 15 March 1864 as a through station on the branch of the Maximilian Railway from Winden to Maximiliansau. The gap to Karlsruhe was closed a year later. The extension of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìGemersheim railway and its continuation to Strasbourg turned it into a junction station on 15 May 1876. A branch of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn was built through the residential area of Dorschberg in 1997. Its entrance building is under heritage protection.  Location  W√∂rth (Rhein) station Is located to the east of the centre of the town on Hanns- Martin-Schleyer-Stra√üe (L 540), the main road thorough W√∂rth. In the immediate vicinity is a connection to federal highway 9. Attached to it is a large parking station, which is free to use.  History = Development= The east-west aligned Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn) was built from Rheinschanze (since 1853: Ludwigshafen) to Bexbach between 1847 and 1849. This mainly served the transport of coal. The Palatine Maximilian Railway (Pf√§lzische Maximiliansbahn, Neustadt-Wissembourg) was built in 1855 as a through line over which coal from the Saargegend and agricultural produce from the Palatinate could be transported to France. In the following years, the Palatine Maximilian Railway Company (Pf√§lzische Maximiliansbahn-Gesellschaft) planned more lines, including a branch from the Maximilian Railway in Winden to Karlsruhe, the then capital of Baden. The reason for this was the hope for better coal traffic to the southern German countries of Baden, W√ºrttemberg and the rest of the Bavaria‚Äîwhich was geographically separated from the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinpfalz). The Bavarian military commander, Karl Krazeisen, who was at that time a troop commander in the Palatinate, emphasised that such a route was also necessary for strategic reasons. In 1859, it received a concession from the Ministry of State for Trade and Public Works. However, resistance came from the town of Germersheim, which urged them to build a railway line first through its territory and from there to Bruchsal. In addition, in 1860, several representatives of South Palatinate communities gathered together and petitioned against a route via Winden and Kandel instead argued for a line from Landau via Offenbach, Herxheim, Leimersheim and Leopoldshafen to Karlsruhe. = Development to the railway junction (1864‚Äì1876) = W√∂rth station was opened on 14 March 1864 together with the Winden‚ÄìMaximiliansau section of the Maximilian Railway. One year later, on 8 May 1865, the gap between Maximiliansau and the Maxau Railway (Maxaubahn) leading from Karlsruhe to Maxau was closed with the completion of the bridge over the Rhine. Thus, continuous operations were possible from Neustadt to Karlsruhe via Winden and W√∂rth. Even before the construction of the Palatine Ludwig Railway from Ludwigshafen to Bexbach, there had been efforts to build a line from north to south in the Palatinate. A branch from the Ludwig Railway to Speyer was built in 1847, the same year as the Ludwigshafen‚ÄìNeustadt section was opened. In 1864, it was extended to Germersheim. In the same year, a committee met in R√ºlzheim and advocated an extension of the line to W√∂rth. The representatives belonged, apart from R√ºlzheim, to Germersheim, Bellheim, Rheinzabern, W√∂rth and Maxau. Nevertheless, the Franco-Prussian War delayed the realisation of the project. Nevertheless, it was not clear whether the planned line would go beyond W√∂rth. Thus the neighbouring community of Kandel demanded that the line be built through its territory. The Directorate of the Palatinate Railway (Pf√§lzische Eisenbahnen) refused this request on 20 November 1871, since such a route would have required a detour which would have reduced the competitiveness of the railway. Kandel, however, did not give up immediately and made a written proposal. Nevertheless, a route through W√∂rth was adopted. This was approved on 15 March 1874. Both the extension of the railway line from Schifferstadt to Germersheim to W√∂rth station and its extension to Strasbourg were opened on 25 July 1876. Thus, the station became a railway junction within the Palatinate and experienced major reconstruction for the first time. = Further development (1876‚Äì1945) = A second track was installed between Winden and Maximiliansau. A second track was also installed on the lines to Schifferstadt and Strasbourg from 1906. From this time onwards, until the outbreak of the First World War, all of the express trains coming from Ludwigshafen used this route; these previously had to detour via the Palatine Maximilian Railway. After the war, Alsace-Lorraine, which had belonged to the German Empire since 1871, was given back to France and long- distance traffic on the W√∂rth‚ÄìStrasbourg railway was permanently transferred to lines through neighbouring Baden. The station was integrated into the newly founded Reichsbahndirektion Ludwigshafen (railway division of Ludwigshafen) in 1922. During its dissolution on 1 May 1936, the station was transferred to the jurisdiction of the railway division of Karlsruhe. In 1938, the line to Karlsruhe between W√∂rth and Maxau was realigned during the building of the fixed Rhine Bridge. In addition, W√∂rth station received an additional, third platform and a connecting subway at the same time. = Developments after the Second World War (1945‚Äì1993) = Operations between W√∂rth and Neustadt was again possible by the end of April 1945. As a result of the bombing of the Rhine Bridge, operations to the east could only recommence two years later. After the Second World War, the section between Winden and W√∂rth was reconstructed as one track during the French occupation to provide reparations. Deutsche Bundesbahn transferred the station after the Second World War to the Bundesbahndirektion Mainz (railway division of Mainz), along with all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1971, the station returned to the jurisdiction of its Karlsruhe counterpart during the dissolution of the railway division of Mainz. The electrification of the line from Karlsruhe to W√∂rth followed in 1974, in order to avoid the need for freight trains from the east having to change of locomotives in Karlsruhe. The part of the line to Strasbourg remaining in Germany became even less significant after the Second World War. Already on 11 July 1980, the last express train ran between Ludwigshafen and Strasbourg. After that, passenger services from W√∂rth ended in Berg, the last station within Germany. On 1 June 1984, passenger services on the German side were abandoned. = Deutsche Bahn and integration into the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn (since 1994) = Between 1994 and the opening of the Stadtbahn between W√∂rth and central Karlsruhe in 1997, Deutsche Bahn operated an introductory service at hourly intervals between Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof and W√∂rth station. The Stadtbahn line was numbered as the S8. On 26 September 1997, the S5 ran past the former terminus of the tramline in central Knielingen over a connecting line including a system change and onto the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway. Starting from W√∂rth station, a new line was opened for the Stadtbahn through the residential area of Dorschberg, which had been built in the post-war period. At the same time a new station was built in the western part of the station area at W√∂rth Ludwigstra√üe (called W√∂rth Alte Bahnmeisterei from 1998), which is only served by the Stadtbahn. In the context of the opening of the Stadtbahn station, a three-storey parking station with 250 parking spaces was built to the east of the station building at the initiative of the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft, the operator of the Stadtbahn line. In 2002, passenger services were reactivated between W√∂rth and Lauterbourg; for marketing reasons, this section has been designated as the Bienwaldbahn (Bienwald Railway). Since 1999, cross- country trips without stop have operated on Sundays between W√∂rth and Lauterbourg. At the timetable change of 2010/2011, the southern section of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway (Germersheim ‚Äì Bellheim ‚Äì Rheinzabern ‚Äì W√∂rth) was included in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Since then the newly created lines S51 and S52 have been running directly between the Karlsruhe inner city, W√∂rth and Germersheim. Since 28 October 2013, W√∂rth station has been completely modernised during upgrading to provide accessibility. This work was divided into three construction phase. The completion of the overall project was planned for October 2014.  Infrastructure In addition to the parking station, which can be used free of charge, W√∂rth (Rhine) has some bicycle parking spaces. The Bahnhof-Treff pub is located in the station building. There are several bus stops on the station forecourt that are served by regional bus routes 549 and 593.  Tracks The numbering of the tracks begins on the north west side of the station building. * Platform 1 has a through track and is located next to the entrance building as a \\"house\\" platform. It is used by the trains of the Bienwaldbahn (RB 52) to/from Lauterbourg. * Platform 2 has a through track and shares an island platform with platform 3. It is used by Stadtbahn lines S51 and S52 towards Germersheim and towards Karlsruhe. * Platform 3 is located on the island platform with platform 2\\\\. It is used by Stadtbahn line S5 towards W√∂rth Badepark and Regional-Express (RE 6) and Regionalbahn (RB 51) services towards Winden, Landau and Neustadt (Weinstra√üe). * Platform 4 shares the southwestern island platform with platform 5\\\\. It is used by Regional services as well as individual Stadtbahn services on line S51 towards Karlsruhe Hbf. * Platform 5 is also a through track and the last railway platform. It is used by Stadtbahn line S5 services towards Karlsruhe, Pforzheim, M√ºhlacker and Bietigheim- Bissingen. Individual services of the Bienwaldbahn to/from Lauterbourg also start or end here. * Tracks 6 to 14 are not used for passenger services. They are usually used as sidings for freight trains.  Entrance building Entrance building of W√∂rth station The entrance building is located on the north-western side of the station. It was built in the Neoclassical and Renaissance Revival styles in around 1870. On its side facing the street, it also has Avant-corps. The building is under monument protection.  Signal boxes in the W√∂rth station area  There are two Mechanical signal boxes in W√∂rth station.  Operations = Passengers= View of platform 1, with part of the parking station at the front right In local rail transport, there are direct connections with one Regional-Express and three Regionalbahn services to Karlsruhe, Winden (Pfalz), Landau (Pfalz), Neustadt (Weinstra√üe), Kaiserslautern, Germersheim, Speyer, Schifferstadt, Ludwigshafen am Rhein and Lauterbourg in Alsace. With Stadtbahn line S5, there is a direct connection from the W√∂rth residential area of Dorschberg via W√∂rth station to the inner city of Karlsruhe, continuing via Pforzheim and M√ºhlacker to Bietigheim- Bissingen. It runs between Badepark and W√∂rth station over a tram line. Between W√∂rth station and Maxau, it runs as a railway, between Knielingen and Durlach it again runs over tram tracks, then on to Bietigheim-Bissingen again over railway tracks. A further direct connection to Karlsruhe's inner city consists of Stadtbahn lines S51 and S52, which run through W√∂rth station between Germersheim and the Karlsruhe city centre. W√∂rth (Rhein) station is located on the network of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe transport association, KVV). As the result of a transitional fare agreement in 1996 between the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (KVV) and the Verkehrsverbund Rhein- Neckar (Rhine-Neckar transport association, VRN), VRN tickets are also accepted. In long-distance transport, the station was served from Monday to Friday by a pair of Intercity services on the Karlsruhe‚ÄìFrankfurt route in the 2013/2014 timetable. Goods train in W√∂rth station = Freight= W√∂rth station has a total of nine tracks without platforms, which serve freight traffic. Just a few years after its inauguration, it was home to numerous factory sidings, which served local industry and trade. In addition, due to its proximity to the French border, it developed into an important customs and transhipment centre. It is now mainly used for transporting cranes from the surrounding recreational lakes in former quarries (baggerseen) as well as for loading new trucks. A siding runs to W√∂rth harbour, where various logistics companies are active.  Planning  The Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG) has long been called for connections to the towns of Landau and Bad Bergzabern on the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network. This, however, requires the electrification of the corresponding lines as well as the doubling of the Winden‚ÄìW√∂rth section of the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway section, which has also been planned for some time. The state government of Rhineland-Palatinate intends to support this project and to take the necessary measures included in the Federal Transport Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) of 2015. However, these plans are to be considered no earlier than 2025.

Alatise received formal training as an architect at Ladoke Akintola University in Oyo State, Nigeria. She then went on to work for 20 years as a studio artist. Her work was exhibited at Venice Biennale‚Äôs 57th edition, themed Viva Arte Viva (Long Live Art). Alatise, along with two other Nigerian artists, Victor Ehikhamenor and Qudus Onikeku, were the first Nigerians to appear at the art exhibition. Her work was a group of life size figures based on the life of a servant girl. Alatise was recipient of the 2017 FNB Art Prize. Alatise cites artist David Dale, Bruce Onabrakpeya, Nike Monica Davies, Susanna Wenger, Nigerian and Yoruba culture as influences of her artwork. Early life Alatise was born in 1975 in Lagos, Nigeria. She and her seven siblings grew up in a traditional Muslim family. Alatise first considered art as a career at age fifteen when she viewed an exhibit by Nigerian artist David Dale. When Alatise expressed her plan to become an artist, her father discouraged the idea, feeling that art was a waste of time. He wanted his daughter to choose an occupation that was more economically stable. Her mother, however, supported Alatise's artistic pursuits, as a spiritualist had foretold that Alatise would one day be wealthy. Despite his original disapproval, her father was eventually won over to the idea before he died. Before pursuing art, Alatise studied architecture at a university, valuing the way it taught her to see and think logically. During her college years Alatise began to explore her interests in art by visiting Jakande, a crafts market in Lagos. There, she practiced various media, including painting, sculpting, and jewelry making.  Career  She began her art career with painting, then branched out to being a multimedia artist, using beads, cloth, resin and other materials. She now works in sculpture, using her art to make statements about social issues, while incorporating literature, symbolism and traditional Yoruba mythology into her works.Alatise also used media such as bead making, visual arts consultancy, creative writing, leather accessory designing, and interior designing. According to Vogue, ‚ÄúAlatise defines her artistic practice as a search for truth and to this end much of her work centres on women in Nigeria and on the political and religious issues at the heart of the country.‚Äù Strongly believing that an artist should depict the world she lives in, Alatise strives to visualize social issues of her country and personal experience. Considering the strongly held social views of gender roles in Nigeria, it is not surprising that much of Alatise's artwork focuses on gender inequality and women's rights. Using her art to make statements about social issues, Alatise acts as a creative social activist through art. Alatise's work expands on Afro-feminist views by fracturing the male mold of Modern African culture. Over the years, Alatise's work has put her on a pedestal with many other distinguished Nigerian female artists like Nike Davies Okundaye, Lara Ige-Jacks, and Ndidi Dike. Although Alatise started her artistic career by exploring three-dimensional illusions on two-dimensional surfaces, she also creates through literature. This combined love of art and literature is reflected in one of her most stunning pieces, \\"Flying Girls\\". Exhibited in Venice Biennale, this piece consisted of eight life-size girls with wings, and, according to fashion and entertainment website BellaNaija, is \\"based on the story of a ten-year old girl who works as a housemaid in Lagos while dreaming of a realm where she is free, who belongs to no one but herself, and can fly.\\" Bella also states that this piece \\"addresses the injustice of the present, but through a vision of a safer imaginary future, especially for little girls.\\" Additionally, this work addresses the issue of child labor. Alatise more directly combines her multidisciplinary skills in her 2013 exhibition, titled Wrapture. This piece combined short stories with sculptures, creating a visual narrative. =Art Auctions= Alatise's 2011 work titled \\"Ascension\\" was sold at N4.4 million in Nigeria's Art Auction, this made her work the best priced among emerging artists. Awards Alatise received the 2017 FNB Art Prize at the launch of the 10th installment of the FNB Joburg Art Fair. This art fair is located in Johannesburg, South Africa.  Other Accomplishments  Her most recent concerns include creating artist residencies in Morocco and Turkey. These are places where artists can live and work on their various art projects while being near other artists with similar interests. In this way, Alatise focuses on supporting up-and-coming artists. In an interview with Ijeoma Ndukwe, Alatise described her goals in these words: \\"When I look at the standard in which I want my work to be, I look at what is happening on a global scale.

Risk scores are designed to be: * Simple to calculate: In many cases all you need to calculate a score is a pen and a piece of paper (although some scores use rely on more sophisticated or less transparent calculations that require a computer program). * Easily interpreted: The result of the calculation is a single number, and higher score usually means higher risk. Furthermore, many scoring methods enforce some form of monotonicity along the measured risk factors to allow a straight forward interpretation of the score (e.g. risk of mortality only increases with age, risk of payment default only increase with the amount of total debt the customer has, etc.). * Actionable: Scores are designed around a set of possible actions that should be taken as a result of the calculated score. Effective score-based policies can be designed and executed by setting thresholds on the value of the score and associating them with escalating actions.  Formal definition  A typical scoring method is composed of 3 components : # A set of consistent rules (or weights) that assign a numerical value (\\"points\\") to each risk factor that reflect our estimation of underlying risk. # A formula (typically a simple sum of all accumulated points) that calculates the score. # A set of thresholds that helps to translate the calculated score into a level of risk, or an equivalent formula or set of rules to translate the calculated score back into probabilities (leaving the nominal evaluation of severity to the practitioner). Items 1 & 2 can be achieved by using some form of regression, that will provide both the risk estimation and the formula to calculate the score. Item 3 requires setting an arbitrary set of thresholds and will usually involve expert opinion. = Estimating risk with GLM = Risk score are designed to represent an underlying probability of an adverse event denoted \\\\lbrace Y = 1 \\\\rbrace given a vector of P explaining variables \\\\mathbf{X} containing measurements of the relevant risk factors. In order to establish the connection between the risk factors and the probability we estimate a set of weights \\\\beta is estimated using a generalized linear model: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\mathbf{Y}  \\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{Y} = 1  \\\\mathbf{X}) = g^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{X} \\\\beta) \\\\end{align} Where g^{-1}: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow [0,1] is a real-valued, monotonically increasing function that maps the values of the linear predictor \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\beta to the interval [0,1] . GLM methods typically uses the logit or probit as the link function.  Estimating risk with other methods  While it's possible to estimate \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{Y} = 1  \\\\mathbf{X}) using other statistical or machine learning methods, the requirements of simplicity and easy interpretation (and monotonicity per risk factor) make most of these methods difficult to use for scoring in this context: * With more sophisticated methods it becomes difficult to attribute simple weights for each risk factor and to provide a simple formula for the calculation of the score. A notable exception are tree-based methods like CART, that can provide a simple set of decision rules and calculations, but cannot ensure the monotonicity of the scale across the different risk factors. * The fact that we are estimating underlying risk across the population, and therefore cannot tag people in advance on an ordinal scale (we can't know in advance if a person belongs to a \\"high risk\\" group, we only see observed incidences) classification methods are only relevant if we want to classify people into 2 groups or 2 possible actions. = Constructing the score = When using GLM, the set of estimated weights \\\\beta can be used to assign different values (or \\"points\\") to different values of the risk factors in \\\\mathbf{X} (continuous or nominal as indicators). The score can then be expressed as a weighted sum: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Score} = \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\beta = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{P} \\\\mathbf{X}_{j} \\\\beta_{j} \\\\end{align} * Some scoring methods will translate the score into probabilities by using g^{-1} (e.g. SAPS II score that gives an explicit function to calculate mortality from the score) or a look-up table (e.g. ABCD¬≤ scoreJohnston SC; Rothwell PM; Nguyen-Huynh MN; Giles MF; Elkins JS; Bernstein AL; Sidney S. \\"Validation and refinement of scores to predict very early stroke risk after transient ischaemic attack\\" Lancet (2007): 369(9558):283-292 or the ISM7 (NI) Scorecard). This practice makes the process of obtaining the score more complicated computationally but has the advantage of translating an arbitrary number to a more familiar scale of 0 to 1. * The columns of \\\\mathbf{X} can represent complex transformations of the risk factors (including multiple interactions) and not just the risk factors themselves. * The values of \\\\beta are sometimes scaled or rounded to allow working with integers instead of very small fractions (making the calculation simpler). While scaling has no impact ability of the score to estimate risk, rounding has the potential of disrupting the \\"optimality\\" of the GLM estimation. = Making score-based decisions = Let \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\lbrace \\\\mathbf{a}_{1}, ... ,\\\\mathbf{a}_{m} \\\\rbrace denote a set of m \\\\geq 2 \\"escalating\\" actions available for the decision maker (e.g. for credit risk decisions: \\\\mathbf{a}_{1} = \\"approve automatically\\", \\\\mathbf{a}_{2} = \\"require more documentation and check manually\\", \\\\mathbf{a}_{3} = \\"decline automatically\\"). In order to define a decision rule, we want to define a map between different values of the score and the possible decisions in \\\\mathbf{A} . Let \\\\tau = \\\\lbrace \\\\tau_1, ... \\\\tau_{m-1} \\\\rbrace be a partition of \\\\mathbb{R} into m consecutive, non-overlapping intervals, such that \\\\tau_1 < \\\\tau_2 < \\\\ldots < \\\\tau_{m-1} . The map is defined as follows: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{If Score} \\\\in [\\\\tau_{j-1},\\\\tau_{j}) \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Take action } \\\\mathbf{a}_{j} \\\\end{align} * The values of \\\\tau are set based on expert opinion, the type and prevalence of the measured risk, consequences of miss-classification, etc. For example, a risk of 9 out of 10 will usually be considered as \\"high risk\\", but a risk of 7 out of 10 can be considered either \\"high risk\\" or \\"medium risk\\" depending on context. * The definition of the intervals is on right open-ended intervals but can be equivalently defined using left open ended intervals (\\\\tau_{j-1},\\\\tau_{j}] . * For scoring methods that are already translated the score into probabilities we either define the partition \\\\tau directly on the interval [0,1] or translate the decision criteria into [g^{-1}(\\\\tau_{j-1}),g^{-1}(\\\\tau_{j})) , and the monotonicity of g ensures a 1-to-1 translation.

Credit scores in Australia and UK are often calculated by using logistic regression to estimate probability of default, and are therefore a type of risk score. * Other financial industries, such as the insurance industry also use scoring methods, but the exact implementation remains a trade secret, except for some rare cases = Social Sciences = * COMPAS score for recidivism, as reverse- engineered by ProPublica using logistic regression and Cox's proportional hazard model.

According to German statistical data from 2016, the number of Romanian nationals in Germany on 31 December, 2015 was 452,718 (up from 94,326 in 2008). By the end of 2019, that number had increased to 748,225. History Romanian embassy in Berlin Romanian general consulate in Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia Emigration to Germany from Romania was common throughout the 20th century, and continued steadily way into the early 21st century. Large numbers of ethnic Germans of Romania (most notably Transylvanian Saxons and Banat Swabians) left the country prior, during, and after the events that ultimately led to World War II. In the times of the communist regime in Romania, albeit the borders were officially closed by authorities, significant numbers of Romanian-Germans were allowed to emigrate to West Germany, particularly in the later years of the Ceau»ôescu era. This formed part of a series of ethnic migrations (including Jews to Israel and Hungarians to Hungary), which were tolerated under the then socialist rulership. During the 1980s, more than half of the people who left Romania went to Germany. After the Romanian Revolution which took place in December of 1989, there has been a mass migration of Transylvania Saxons to Germany, approximately half a million of them immigrated to Germany. Emigration of ethnic Romanians to Germany become quite common in the 21st century, particularly after the entry of Romania in the European Union in 2007. The Romanian diaspora in Germany has a strong presence. If descent is actually taken into account as the main criterion of immigration, then the total number of individuals living in Germany who stem from Romania (both Romanian-German and Romanian) may amount to as much as 2,000,000 residents, therefore putting the Romanian diaspora living in this country the largest of all Romanian ones living within the European Union.
