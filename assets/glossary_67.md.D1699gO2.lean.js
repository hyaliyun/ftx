He began his college football career with the UC Davis Aggies before transferring to the UCLA Bruins program. Kelley rushed for 1,000 yards in each of his two seasons with the Bruins, earning second-team all-conference honors in the Pac-12 in 2019. He was selected by the Chargers in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft. Early life Kelley was born in Inglewood, California. His mother Jacqueline, a speech pathologist at an elementary school, raised him and his older brother Daniel as a single parent. Growing up in Lancaster in Los Angeles County, Kelley was a fan of UCLA. His mother volunteered at the University of California, Los Angeles, and he had an aunt and uncle who studied there; his uncle played on the Bruins baseball team. Kelley attended Eastside High School and rushed for 1,903 yards and 22 touchdowns in his final two seasons with the Lions. As a senior, he earned first-team all-conference honors in the Golden League, and was named the conference's running back of the year. College career A two-star recruit who was ranked the No. 232 running back in the class of 2015, Kelley began his career in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) at the University of California, Davis, the only school that pursued him. With the Aggies, he coped with injuries and shared time with another fine back in Manusomo Luuga. In his first season, Kelley was a year younger than his fellow freshmen. He did not receive a full scholarship until the start of his sophomore year, but relinquished it and transferred after the season, when head coach Ron Gould and the rest of the coaching staff were fired. Although the new staff wanted him to stay, Kelley challenged himself to reach college football's highest level. He ended his UC Davis career with 1,139 yards and seven touchdowns in two seasons. As part of his release from the school, Kelley was permitted to transfer to just two schools in California: UCLA and USC. He also received interest from Boise State. Kelley signed as a walk-on with the Bruins of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), and served on the scout team in 2017 while sitting out the year as a redshirt due to transfer rules. Leading up to the 2018 season, he encountered another coaching change when UCLA replaced Jim L. Mora with Chip Kelly. The new coach awarded a scholarship to Kelley. A redshirt junior, Kelley did not play much until Week 4 at Colorado. He was benched and did not play a week earlier against Fresno State after being outperformed during practice. In the first two weeks, he had just 11 carries for 27 yards. Following an open week in UCLA's schedule, he regrouped and ran for 124 yards in 12 carries against Colorado after being the team's best player in training sessions leading up to the game. Kelley became one of the nation's top running backs over the final two months of the season. He emerged as the Bruins' top offensive player with six 100-yard games, and UCLA's scoring increased as well. On the road in Week 6 against California, UCLA earned their first win of the season as Kelley ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns in a 37–7 victory. Against USC, Kelley had a career-high 289 yards rushing on 40 carries to help the Bruins earn their first win in four years in their crosstown rivalry with the Trojans. It was the most rushing yards for a player on either team in the history of the rivalry. He scored two touchdowns, including one on a career- long 61-yard run. Kelley ended the season with 1,243 yards rushing, the 10th- highest single-season total in UCLA history, and his 113 rushing yards per game ranked fourth-highest in the Pac-12 Conference and ninth in the nation. He ran for at least one touchdown in each of the final eight games, and finished with 12 touchdowns to rank second in the conference. Kelley earned honorable mention in All-Pac-12 voting by conference coaches, while the Associated Press named him to their first team. He was named the Bruins' most valuable player. In 2019, Kelley returned for his senior year after deciding against entering the NFL Draft. He injured his right knee in practice, and subsequently missed most of training camp. He did not play in the season opener against Cincinnati. On October 26 against Arizona State, Kelley ran 34 times for 164 yards and a career-high four touchdowns in a 42–32 upset over the No. 24 Sun Devils. He rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns the following week against Colorado, helping the Bruins earn their fourth win and surpass their total from a year before. In the final game of his college career, Kelley ran for 76 yards against Cal to finish the season with 1,060 yards, becoming the eighth player in UCLA history to run for 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons. His 96.4 yards rushing per game and 12 rushing touchdowns were both second in the conference behind Zack Moss of Utah. Kelley was named second-team All-Pac-12, the only Bruin to be named to either the first or second team. He ended his UCLA career with 454 rushes for 2,303 yards and 24 touchdowns. After being named to the Senior Bowl roster as a replacement for Moss, he improved his draft stock with a game-high 105 yards on 15 carries.  Professional career  Kelley was selected by the Los Angeles Chargers in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft with the 112th overall pick. He competed with Justin Jackson to be the backup behind Chargers featured back Austin Ekeler. In his NFL debut in the 2020 season opener, Kelley had 60 rushing yards on 12 carries and scored the team's only touchdown on a five-yard run in the fourth quarter in a 16–13 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.

He is known for his great works Durghata Bhavadipa on Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya and Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya Vyakhyana, a commentary on Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya of Madhva . Life According to hagiographies, He was born as Keshavacharya into a Kannada-speaking Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family. Satyabhinava Tirtha who was born with a 'Madhavi Rishi amsa' had occupied the pontificate with distinction for 32 years, 6 months and three days. Satyadhisha Tirtha was the first and Satyadhiraja Tirtha was second disciple. Both these died within a year of their ordination. Later he ordained Kolhapur Krishnacharya as the next pontiff as Sri Satyapurna Tirtha. After his death in 1706, his mortal remains were enshrined in the mutt at Nachiarkoil, which is few miles away from Kumbakonam. He was succeeded by Satyapurna Tirtha. Works Three works have been attributed to Satyabhinava. His Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya Vyakhyana is a commentary running up to 3,220 granthas on Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya of Madhva. Duraghatabhavadipa is a commentary running up to 8,160 granthas on Madhva's Bhagavata Tatparya Niryana which, apart from elucidating the concepts of the source text, criticises the allegations against Madhva raised by some scholars and grammarians. His work Sri Satyanatha Guru Stuti is a praise poem in honour of his guru Satyanatha Tirtha. According to Sharma, \\"Almost on every page of his gloss in his Bhagavata, we find certain criticisms on the Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya of Madhva repudiated. The determination and persistence with which he pursues these critics show that Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya had been severely criticized by some later-day commentators probably Advaitic of unknown identity. The commentary throws light on many knotty points. It's special interest lies in hunting up the criticisms against the Bhagavata Tatparya, and silencing them\\".

His laboratory is part of the Synthetic and Systems Biology Unit at BRC. His research is at the interface of evolution, antibiotic resistance and genome engineering and has published over 70 scientific publications in these areas. Education Csaba Pal completed his Masters in Biology at Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, in 1998. Four years later he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest in 2002. In 2018 he received a Doctor of Science degree from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Csaba Pal spent several years abroad with scholarships. He had the opportunity to research in Bath, Oxford, Heidelberg and Italy. Prior to his return to Hungary in 2008, he worked as a visiting scientist at the University of Trento. Career and research Csaba Pal works on fundamental and applied problems in the evolution of genome networks and antibiotic resistance. To achieve these goals, he develops methods in systems biology, computational metabolic modelling and genome engineering. Genome evolution In 2001, Csaba Pal and colleagues demonstrated that highly expressed genes in yeast evolve slowly. Later, they argued that evolutionary rate of a protein is predominantly influenced by its expression level rather than functional importance. This research has contributed to a paradigmatic shift in the field of protein evolution. Balazs Papp, Csaba Pal, and Laurence Hurst studied molecular mechanisms underlying dosage sensitivity. They specifically tested what is now known as the dosage balance hypothesis. The hypothesis offers a synthesis on seemingly unrelated problems such as the evolution of dominance, gene duplicability and co-evolution of protein complexsubunits. In 2007, Pal and colleagues demonstrated that antagonistic co-evolution with parasites has a large impact on the evolution of bacterial mutation rate. This paper showed how biotic interactions shape mutation rate evolution. More recently, the Pal lab explored the consequences of compensatory adaptation on gene content evolution. It is well known that while core cellular processes are generally conserved during evolution, the underlying genes differ somewhat between related species. They demonstrated that gene loss initiates adaptive genomic changes that rapidly restores fitness, but this process has substantial pleiotropic effects on cellular physiology and evolvability upon environmental change. Network evolution The Pal lab has also contributed to the nascent field of evolutionary systems biology. Their research focused on understanding the extent to which evolution is predictable at the molecular level. Using genome-scale metabolic network modelling combined with experimental tools they studied key issues in evolution, such as mutational robustness, horizontal gene transfer, genome reduction, epistasis, promiscuous enzyme reactions, and complex adaptations. Antibiotic resistance Csaba Pal's laboratory currently studies the problem of antibiotic resistance. By combining laboratory evolution, genome sequencing, and functional analysis, they charted the map of evolutionary trade-offs between antibiotics. They found that multidrug resistance mutations in bacteria simultaneously enhance sensitivity to many other unrelated drugs (collateral sensitivity), and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Genome engineering Finally, the Pal lab is an advocate of the emerging field of evolutionary genome engineering. Genome engineering enables the modification of specific genomic locations in a directed and combinatorial manner, and allow studying central evolutionary issues in which natural genetic variation is limited or biased. However, current tools have been optimized for a few laboratory model strains, lead to the accumulation of numerous undesired, off-target modifications, and demand extensive modification of the host genome prior to large-scale editing. The Pal laboratory presented a simple, all-in-one solution. The method is unique as it allows systematic comparison of mutational effects and epistasis across a wide range of bacterial species. Awards and honours Csaba Pal received several domestic and international awards, including the Ignaz Lieben Award (2009), Szent-Györgyi Talents Award (2014), and the Bolyai Prize (2015). In 2016, Csaba Pal became member of Academia Europaea. In 2017 he was selected as EMBO (European Molecular Biology Organization) member. and in 2018, became a member of the FEMS.

Its work is solely supported by donations. By financing research, it develops diagnostic tests and minimally invasive procedures for urological diseases. By supporting training, it improves surgical skills, and by awarding grants it provides opportunities for surgeons to travel to various parts of the world and practise new techniques. TUF was founded under the banner of 'The British Urological Foundation' in 1995 by urologists Roger Kirby and John M. Fitzpatrick, and introduced robotic surgical training for urologists in 2011. It holds teaching sessions to prepare final year trainees for consultant posts and works in collaboration with the Fulbright Commission to grant 'The Fulbright Urology Foundation Award', for a research assignment in an academic higher education institution in the States. Projects granted funding by TUF have included those concentrating on cancers of the prostate, bladder and kidney, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, BPH and prostatitis. TUF organises a number of fundraising and awareness events, including their 'Annual Urology Awareness Month' and charity bike rides. Its contributions have included funding into the research of a tool developed to predict a person's personalised prognosis following a diagnosis of prostate cancer. History The British Urological Foundation was founded in 1995 by urologists Roger Kirby and John M. Fitzpatrick. Funding came from the British Journal of Urology International (BJUI) and the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS), and its work has been solely supported by donations. It later became known as The Urology Foundation. 2003 marked the beginning of educational visits to the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, US, and eight years later, robotic surgical training for urologists was promoted by TUF. In its first 15 years, projects granted funding by TUF have included those concentrating on cancers of the prostate, bladder and kidney, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, BPH and prostatitis.  Purpose  TUF aims to raise awareness of urological diseases, and works across the UK and Ireland with the purpose of improving the knowledge and skills of surgeons who operate on diseases of the male and female urinary-tract system and the male reproductive organs and funds research to improve outcomes of all urological conditions and urological cancers. TUF's objectives are: > To advance, promote, encourage, develop and improve the study and knowledge > of urology, urological surgery and the general knowledge of science and > medicine and all matters relating to the progress and development of that > branch of science and medicine, and for that purpose to fund, aid, maintain > and endow scholarships, fellowships, chairs and bursaries and generally to > assist in the funding, instruction and support of persons and institutions > engaged or involved in urological research work The method used to achieve their objective is by developing diagnostic tests and minimally invasive procedures for urological diseases by financing research, by improving surgical skills by supporting training and by providing opportunities for surgeons to travel to parts of the world and practise new techniques and treatments by supporting them with grants. Members Patrons of TUF include Handel Evans, Rosemary Macaire, Jane MacQuitty, Steven Norris and Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who in 2014, in support of TUF, gave a lecture at the Royal Geographical Society titled \\"Living Dangerously\\". Having been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007, he underwent a five-hour robotic prostatectomy at the Royal Marsden Hospital before reaching the summit of Mount Everest in 2009. The proceeds of his lecture about his expeditions were donated to TUF. Trustees of TUF include Baroness Wyld and Ben Challacombe, and partners of TUF include: *British Association of Urological Surgeons *Association of Medical Research Charities *British Association of Urological Nurses *National Institute for Health Research *Specialist Urological Registrars' Group Since 2011, 'The Urology Foundation Alumni' has existed as a forum for grant beneficiaries to share information and knowledge and have a role in the development of the charity. Training A laparoscopic robotic surgery machine TUF has sent surgeons to a number of specialist centres around the world to train in new technologies. These have included training in cystectomy and creation of a neobladder in Mansoura in Egypt. Teaching of robotic laparoscopy was initially arranged in 2003 with Cleveland Clinic's surgeon Indy Gill and later, robotic training programmes included working with Gill at the University of Southern California, Joseph \\"Jay\\" A. Smith at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville and Mani Menon at the Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, US. The Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, is one of the UK's robotic training centres. Preparing final year trainees for consultant posts have been taught through TUF-arranged interview skill courses. Fundraising In 2005, the BAUS awarded Roger Kirby the St Peter's Medal for his fundraising activities for TUF. In 2014, the annual 'Urology Awareness Month' campaign was launched and has subsequently taken place every September, with the aim of increasing awareness of all urological diseases, not only cancers. For more than 10 years funds have been raised in the 'Hike for Hope' programme. This included in 2017 almost 40 people who cycled through Vietnam and Cambodia to raise funds for TUF. TUF activities have been supported by Stephen Fry. In the same year and for the same purpose, surgeon Michal Smolski from Burnley hospital cycled 300 miles in two days from London to Amsterdam. In 2018, its fifth year, the theme was \\"We have heard of the prostate, but do we know what it is?\\" TUF ran this campaign with the support of Stephen Fry, to dispel taboos surrounding cancers of the genitourinary tract. The following year, just prior to an interview conducted by BBC panorama journalist, Jane Corbin, Fry publicly thanked TUF: > My run-in with prostate cancer taught me about the importance of charities > who are working hard on behalf of patients like myself. Thanks to the work > The Urology Foundation (TUF) did long before my diagnosis, my experience of > prostate cancer was far less fraught than it could have been. My excellent > surgeon was trained through TUF and so it's a pleasure to be joining them > for what I'm sure will be a riotous evening. In December 2018, for the purpose of fundraising, four men from Cornwall, with a supporting tweet from Stephen Fry, set off in a ocean rowing boat with a mission to row and cross the Atlantic Ocean, from La Gomera, in the Canary Islands. They were successful and arrived in Antigua 43 days later on 24 January 2019. Two of the seamen subsequently gave TUF's 'Guest Lecture'. Awards Senior Clinical Researcher in Robotic Surgery and Urology at the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, Prasanna Sooriakumaran, was awarded the TUF medal for \\"Best Research Proposal\\" of 2016. TUF works in collaboration with the Fulbright Commission to present The Fulbright Urology Foundation Award. Covering projects concerned with urological diseases, the grant allows academics, urologists or specialist nurses to follow a three- to nine-month research assignment in an academic higher education institution in the States. Achievements By its twentieth year, research into improving urology care had received more than £3 million from TUF. A significant change in the way that urological surgery is performed in the West Midlands resulted from the work of urologist Peter Cooke, who had previously received robotic training in 2012 via TUF, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, US. In 2018, TUF carried out a survey of how often British men checked their testicles, which showed that only half of them did so in the last year. As a result, TUF established #tufnutsTuesdays, a campaign to encourage men to examine their testicles on the first Tuesday of every month. A special service for people with kidney cancer was developed at the Royal Free Hospital, London, by surgeons whose training was funded by TUF. TUF contributed funding into the research of 'PREDICT Prostate', a tool launched in 2019 and developed to predict a person's personalised prognosis following a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Chicago: Some Other Traditions (catalogue), Madison, WI: Madison Art Center, 1983. =Early work= As an undergraduate, Piatek created two groups of paintings that brought early recognition. One employed shaped canvasses—wave, \\"X,\\" or upside-down \\"U\\" forms—that featured stripes or tubes, often following the contours of the canvas edge, such as Untitled (small X painting) (1967).Chicago Daily News. \\"Surrealism His Hobby,\\" Chicago Daily News, November 10, 1969. Writers described them as direct responses to Frank Stella's minimalist stripe paintings that nonetheless broke with the era's dominant Greenbergian formalism by employing chiaroscuro modeling and illusionistic space rather than affirming the flatness of the picture plane (as Stella did). Piatek also experimented with a motif of monumental, writhing tubular forms (e.g., Untitled, 1967); these works were his first awarded prizes (in the AIC 1967 and 1968 \\"Chicago and Vicinity\\" shows)Halstead, Whitney.

Piatek has painted them as twisting, patterned and symmetrical forms that emerge out of dark, packed, enigmatic space; reviewers such as Franz Schulze and Jane Allen described them as evoking close-up magnification of organic (bodies, limbs, phalluses, worms, intestines, trees), man-made (coils, ropes, chains, metal piping, knots, balloons), and symbolic forms.Allen, Jane and Derek Guthrie. \\"Gallery notes,\\" Chicago Tribune, February 27, 1972.Haydon, Harold. \\"Variety is the spice of showings,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, February 18, 1972.Schulze, Franz.

He was initially inspired by a mural commission that sought a landscape or tree image, leading him to experiment with sinuous, archetypal forms and emblematic hieroglyphs. He pursued this direction privately in directly referential, symbolic drawings of spiders and trees, artifact-like sculpture, and carvings of snakes, stars, podlike sarcophagi and dead men in boats, covered in mud, twine and fabric.Bonesteel, Michael. \\"Frank Piatek at Richard Gray,\\" Art in America, December 1981.

Piatek also moved to Roy Boyd Gallery (six solo shows, 1984–2001)—well-known for its focus on abstractionists, including Conger and Loving—to further highlight their mutual concerns. During that period, Piatek continued to explore similar formal concerns in his tube motif, but experimented widely with painting techniques and materials ranging from old- master glazing techniques to methods adapted from modernists like Willem de Kooning to acrylic paint.McCracken, David. \\"Piatek's switch to acrylic energizes his expressiveness,\\" Chicago Tribune, December 28, 1990, p. 64. These new methods—inspired by research for an SAIC painting course he developed—shifted his work toward a more layered, soft-edged, painterly approach with a loosening of form, more rhythmic surface activity, and more brilliant color and spatial depth (e.g., Glowing Forms, 1984). Critics such as Alan Artner and Christopher Lyon identified a greater sense of eroticism in the work, alternately comparing it to the fleshy ruddiness of Rubens, the odalisques of Ingres, and musculature of Michelangelo.Lyon, Christopher. \\"Frank Piatek,\\" Art Express, November/December 1981.Lyon, Christopher. \\"Abstract/Symbol/Image,\\" ARTnews, December 1984.Polanski, G.

Critics such as Alan Artner and Andy Argy described these combinations of mixed-media, layered marks and processes as among his most elaborate works—dark, distilled stream-of-conscious pictorial diaries engaging genealogies of cultural history that reveal the sensibilities and interplay of abstraction and figuration underlying his paintings. Piatek extended this exploration of the creative process Ii several later installations. He mounted two double-installations with his wife, painter Judith Geichman—Studio Process Residue (1999) and Picturing the Studio (2009)—that explored studio residue (raw materials, sketches, books, sources) as a companion text illuminating the artist's work; in both shows, they each created representations of their studios, including finished work.Camper, Fred. \\"Garden Variety Inspiration,\\" Chicago Reader, September 16, 1999.

The book is taught in Hanafi schools today. Authorship Al-Kasani was a student of the Hanafi legal scholar 'Ala' al-Din al-Samarqandi (died 1144), the author of Tuhfat al-Fuqaha'. Al-Samarqandi's daughter, Fatima, was also trained in Fiqh. Fatima al-Samarqandi was considered as the most beautiful woman of her time, leading to many proposals to marry her. She and her father had rejected many people, including rulers, who asked for her hand in marriage. Fatima and her father only accepted Al-Kasani's proposal after he wrote Bada'i As-Sana'i as an explanation of Tuhfat Al-Fuqaha, and Bada'i As-Sana'i was accepted as a Bridal Gift for Fatima.

Despite being a commentary, it does not have the characteristics of a commentary, but rather a strictly systematic account of the various legal domains. Al-Kāsānī begins each chapter with an outline in which he explains which subjects he intends to deal with. However, despite its methodological clarity, the work had no major impact on the development of Hanafi law for a certain period of time.

The most commonly accepted threshold is p < 5 × 10−8, which is based on performing a Bonferroni correction for all the independent common SNPs across the human genome. If a p-value is found to be lower than this threshold in a genome-wide association study, the null hypothesis of no true SNP-association will typically be rejected. However, there has been some criticism of this threshold, with a 2012 study suggesting that a significant number of associations with p-values just above this threshold are genuine, replicable associations. The authors of this study concluded that their finding \\"...suggests a possible relaxation in the current GWS threshold.\\" More recently, it has been suggested that the conventional threshold should be modified to take into account the increasing prevalence of low-frequency genetic variants in genome-wide association studies.

She was the wife of Mōri Terumoto. Her father was Shishido Takaie, and her mother was the daughter of Mōri Motonari, Lady Goryū. She was also called . Life Seikōin was the third daughter of Shishido Takaie in 1558. In March 1563, a betrothal with Mōri Terumoto was established, and in April 1568, a magnificent wedding was held inside the Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle. However, the engagement was once annulled by Mōri Motonari. At the time, with the Ashikaga shogunate shōgun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, as a mediator, it was decided that Terumoto would marry Ōtomo Sōrin's daughter as a peace negotiation.宮本義己「足利将軍義輝の芸・豊和平調停」 (初出:『政治経済史学』102・103号 (1974) /所収:木下昌規 編『シリーズ・室町幕府の研究 第四巻 足利義輝』 (戎光祥出版、2018) ) 2018、P221-223. Afterward, because the peace negotiation failed, the marriage between Terumoto and Sōrin's daughter was not followed through, so Terumoto and Seikōin proceeded to be wed. Since there were no children between Seikōin and Terumoto, the latter adopted Hoida Motokiyo's child, Hidemoto, in 1585. However, Seitai-in, a concubine of Terumoto, gave birth to Mōri Hidenari in 1595. Hidemoto made another branch in the Chōfu Domain, leaving Hidenari as Terumoto's heir. After the Mōri clan allied with Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590, prior to the Siege of Odawara, Seikōin went to the capital with her court ladies. After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, when the Mōri clan was reduced to two provinces – Suō and Chōshū – Seikōin moved to Yamaguchi, and she moved again in 1604 to Hagi Castle. She was devoted to Shin Buddhism, and around 1604 she erected the Kōshōji Temple in Yamaguchi. Around 1608, it was moved to Hagi. In 1631, Seikōin died in Miyano Village, Yamaguchi, at the age of 74. Her tomb is located at Tenju-in in Hagi, Yamaguchi, alongside Terumoto. Terumoto's tomb is 2.1m high, and Seikōin's is 1.8m high and large, both granite-made gorintō. Also, due to her death, Kōshōji Temple is called \\"Getsurinzan Seikōji\\" in her honor, which holds a portrait of her to this day. In popular culture Seikōin is portrayed in the 1997 NHK Taiga drama Mōri Motonari as \\"Tamahime\\". She is portrayed by Matsumoto Rio.

Originally built in Lviv in 1897 according to Leonard Marconi's design, the monument was transferred to Wrocław in 1956. History The monument was designed by sculptor Leonard Marconi in 1897 in Lviv, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (part of the Austro- Hungarian Empire) and cast in bronze. The Neo-classical sculpture features playwright Aleksander Fredro on a sandstone pedestal with inscriptions on three sides wearing a chamarre and holding a roll of paper and a goose quill. The monument was funded by the Lviv Artistic and Literary Society (Lwowskie Koło Literacko-Artystyczne) and ceremonially unveiled on 24 October 1897 at the Academic Square (currently Shevchenko Avenue) in Lviv in the presence of many prominent dignitaries including the Land Marshal of Galicia Stanisław Marcin Badeni, prince Eustachy Sanguszko, archbishop Izaak Mikołaj Isakowicz, and mayor of Lviv Godzimir Małachowski. The monument occupied that location until 1950. After the Second World War, Lviv was incorporated into the USSR and in 1945 in Kiev, the Polish delegation signed an additional protocol to the 1944 agreement between the Polish Committee of National Liberation and the Ukrainian SSR, which allowed to hand over to the Polish government the national monuments in Lviv connected to Polish culture and history with the exception of the Adam Mickiewicz Monument which \\"enjoys great popularity and is loved by the Ukrainian nation\\". Transfer to Poland The monument was transferred to Poland in March 1950. It was initially displayed in Wilanów where it remained until 1956. The city of Wrocław was chosen to host it considering the fact that after the war a great number of Poles from Lviv were repatriated there. Besides this, Aleksander Fredro visited Wrocław in the past as a young military officer fighting alongside Napoleon. It was unveiled on 15 July 1956 at the Wrocław Market Square in the place previously occupied by the Monument to Frederick William III of Prussia.

She lectured at Royal Holloway, University of London for nearly 30 years, and was instrumental in establishing it as a centre of Byzantine studies. She served for ten years as director of the Hellenic Institute at Royal Holloway, University of London, transforming it into a centre for interdisciplinary research into Greek and Byzantine history. Early Life and Education Julian was the daughter of Cappadocian entrepreneur Chrysostomos Chrysostomides and his wife, Victoria, née Rizas, a phanariot. Her early education took place at the Zappeion School, a girls' Greek lyceum in Istanbul, and she initially pursued university education at the Sorbonne. Discouraged by the rising anti-Greek sentiment in Istanbul, she moved to England in 1950 to pursue a degree in Literae humaniores at St Anne's College, Oxford, from which she graduated in 1955. That year she began a BLitt at Royal Holloway under Professor Joan Hussey, writing on Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus and his policy towards the Ottomans. She became a naturalized citizen of the UK. Career In 1965 Chrysostomides was appointed lecturer in history at Royal Holloway College. In 1983 she became senior lecturer and in 1992 reader in Byzantine history. She retired in 1993. Throughout her career she published on Byzantine history and historiography, political theory, economy, and society. Her publications explored Byzantine women, Venetian commercial activities in the Byzantine empire, Byzantine perceptions of war and peace, and the rise of the Ottomans. Among her major contributions were the critical edition and translation of Manuel II Palaeologus's Funeral Oration on his Brother Theodore (1985), and the edited sources collected in Monumenta Peloponnesiaca (1995). She also produced a number of volumes in co- operation with other scholars, including The Letter of the Three Patriarchs to Emperor Theophilos (with Joseph Munitiz and others, 1997), The Greek Islands and the Sea (with Charalambos Dendrinos and Jonathan Harris, 2004), ‘Sweet Land …’: Lectures on the History and Culture of Cyprus (with Charalambos Dendrinos, 2006), and a Catalogue of the Greek Manuscripts in Lambeth Palace Library (with John Barron and others, 2006). Chrysostomides was also active in encouraging postgraduate students: with Joseph Munitiz and Athanasios Angelou, she established Britain’s first postgraduate seminar on editing Byzantine texts, and with Angelou and Jonathan Riley-Smith, established a MA program in Late Antique and Byzantine Studies at Royal Holloway. In 1998 she became director of the Hellenic Institute at Royal Holloway. In her ten years as director she reorganized the institute, establishing it as an interdisciplinary research centre for the study of the history of Greece and Byzantium, and raising funds to establish lectureships, fellowships, graduate studentships, and bursaries. In 1999, the Greek state bestowed on her the title of Ambassador of Hellenism in recognition of her long services to Hellenism and her contribution to Byzantine studies. Death Julian Chrysostomides died on 18 October 2008 after a seven-month battle with cancer. Her funeral took place on 1 November 2008 at St Sophia's Cathedral, London, attended by representatives of Greece and the Republic of Cyprus as well as her former students, colleagues and friends. Joseph Munitiz provided the funeral oration. She is survived by her adopted son John, younger son of her twin brother Nikos.

His life was a saga of supreme spiritual achievements.

He studied Vyakarana and Shastras under Kumbhari Vasudevacharya. He was ordained and was made the pontiff of Uttaradi Math in 1638. He served as pontiff of mutt for 21 years and 9 months. After his death in 1660, his mortal remains were enshrined in the mutt at Kurnool. He was succeeded by Satyanatha Tirtha. Works Satyanidhi Tirtha authored three works consisting of commentaries on the works of Vyasatirtha and a few hymns. They are as follows: *Bhedojjivana, a gloss on Bhedojjivana of Vyasatirtha *Vayu Bharathi Stotra, a praise hymn on Vayu and Bharathi. *Vishnu Sahasranama Vyakhyana, a commentary on Vishnu Sahasranama. Legacy Satyanidhi Tirtha has been eulogised by Sarkara Srinivasa in his contemporaneous kavya Satyanidhivilasa, a kavya in honor of Satyanidhi in 8 cantos.

Early life  Cicely Musgrave Craven was born near Kendal, Westmorland, the daughter of Robert Musgrave Craven and Margaret Gibbons Craven. Her father was a medical examiner. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey school, and at St Hilda’s College, Oxford, where she studied history from 1909 to 1912. (Her degree was not granted until 1920, when women were first allowed to receive Oxford degrees.) She also earned a London teaching credential.  Career  Craven taught history at Winchester Girls’ High School in 1914 and 1915, and at Grey Coat Hospital School in 1916. During World War I, she worked at the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of Labour. In 1926, with no previous engagement in the cause of prison reform, Craven replaced Margery Fry as secretary of the Howard League for Penal Reform. She was also editor of the Howard Journal. In this role, she testified in parliamentary hearings, gave interviews, wrote for periodicals and professional journals, conducted summer schools, and worked with other organizations on common causes. She took particular interest in preventive and remedial approaches to juvenile delinquency. She retired from the Howard League in 1950, and was succeeded by the League's first full-time paid secretary, Hugh Klare. Craven was appointed justice of the peace for St Albans in the 1930s, and was district councillor for the same city from 1928 to 1932. She was also active in the St Albans Housing Association.  Personal life  Craven lived with her sister, Millicent Musgrave Craven, a social worker, in Welwyn Garden City. Cicely Craven died there in 1962, aged 71 years, from cancer.

Life and career  Both Seiya and Soshina have had prior experience in the comedy industry before they officially debuted as a comedy duo. Seiya performed manzai on television in elementary school and also had appearances on television when he was considered as an amateur comedian in middle school. Soshina competed in R-1 Grand Prix in 2010 as a high school student using the name Soshina, making it to the second round.Schedule and Results｜R-1 Grand Prix 2010 Around that same time, he also administered an oogiri website.『霜降り明星のだましうち!』（ABC Radio）Broadcast 2018-01-28 = High School Manzai = Before meeting Seiya, Soshina formed an amateur comedy duo in 2009 with his high school friend called Spade.

The duo rose to popularity among high school students in Osaka, and Soshina became known to Seiya, who was attending another high school and had no connection to Soshina at the time.

The representative and finalist for the Kansai region that year was Stand Box, with Naoto Ikeda, who later formed the comedy duo Rainbow and became an member of Yoshimotozaka46. In the final year of their high school, both of their units were dissolved and both Seiya and Soshina entered the All Japan High School Comedy- Owarai Inter-High 2011 competition as solo comedians. The two met each other once again after both of them made the finals. It was around this time that Soshina began to recognize Seiya's talents. = University and formation = Seiya went on to attend Kindai University and Soshina to Doshisha University. Soshina became active as an amateur comedian, appearing on and winning the 2012 All That's Manzai televised competition held by MBS TV as the youngest winner at age 19. He passed the audition to enter Yoshimoto Kogyo as an affiliated comedian in just the first year of university, which lead to his decision to drop out and focus on comedy. Soshina continued activities as a solo comedian during that time while Seiya had aspirations to become a teacher. Although he had achieved some success solo, Soshina sought after a comedic partner and believed Seiya was the perfect candidate. Soshina actively invited and attempted to convince Seiya into forming a comedy duo with him.『吉本超合金A』（TV Osaka）Broadcast 2017-11-26 Although Seiya was uncertain for a while, he ended up accepting the invitation and the two formed the unit known as Shimofuri Myojo. The name Shimofuri Myojo was thought up by both Seiya and Soshina, with Shimofuri by Seiya and Myojo by Soshina. Shimofuri (霜降り) translates literally to \\"marbled\\", as Seiya chose the word because he thinks it sounds good. Myojo (明星) translates literally as \\"bright star\\", chosen by Soshina. Initially, Soshina said Myojo was chosen because he wanted something that sounded bright, as the opposite of how his personality is (Soshina proclaims that he himself is rather gloomy and dark). However, it was later known that the main inspiration for the name comes from a character called Shiranui Akeno Myojo (不知火 明乃 明星) from the anime Seto no Hanayome, which Soshina was into at the time.Myojo Magazine 2019 April Edition p.90-91 The duo was officially formed in January, 2013. = Career as a duo = The duo won the 2017 ABC Comedy Grand Prix and became regulars on the variety show Arata Shiinami 24, which later became AI- TV produced and broadcast by Fuji TV.

The album contains her first 17 singles for Atlantic Records released in the United States from her debut for the label \\"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\\" of February 1967 through \\"Border Song (Holy Moses)\\" of October 1970. The Amazon sales website identifies these as digitally remastered versions of the original mono issues, although that is not indicated in the set's liner notes or packaging. The original recordings were produced by Jerry Wexler, at times in collaboration with Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin. Content Most of these singles, both A and b sides, appeared on the Atlantic Records albums released by Franklin during the same years. Some singles were released ahead of those albums, with others appearing on the market after the album. All 17 A-sides made the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the first eight all charted in the top ten including her chart-topping signature song, \\"Respect.\\" Six b-sides also made the Billboard chart independently, with her version of \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" also making the top ten. Missing is her 1968 version of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" released as a single in the United Kingdom only. These singles are arguably the greatest work of Franklin's career. Of the 34 tracks on this set, seven appear on the Billboard list of her ten greatest songs, 16 appear on the Rolling Stone list of Franklin's greatest 50 songs, while half of the tally for Franklin's 20 essential songs according to The New York Times appear on this set.

The name is French, meaning \\"ox blood\\" (or cow blood), and the glaze and the colour are also called ox-blood or oxblood in English, in this and other contexts. Sang de boeuf was one of a number of new \\"flambé\\" glazes, marked by \\"unpredictable but highly decorative and varying effects\\",Wood, 58 developed in the Jingdezhen porcelain kilns during the Kangxi reign (1662–1722).Sullivan, 226; Valenstein, 238–242; Pollock According to one scholar: \\"In its finer examples, this spectacular glaze gives the impression that one is gazing through a limpid surface layer, which is slightly crazed and strewn with countless bubbles, to the color that lies underneath\\".Valenstein, 238 As with most Chinese red glazes, the main colouring agent is copper oxide, fired in a reducing atmosphere (without oxygen); finishing them in an oxidizing atmosphere may have been part of the process. From the late 19th century onwards, usually after lengthy experiment, many Western potters produced versions of the Chinese glaze, which is technically very difficult to achieve and control.Ellison, 108–109; Burke and Frelinghuysen, 213–216; Battie, 161–162 Small 18th-century vase, with thinning glaze at top For Chinese ceramics, some museums and books prefer the term \\"sang de boeuf\\", some \\"oxblood\\", in both cases with varying use of hyphens, and capitals and italics for \\"sang de boeuf\\".Recent books published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art use: \\"Sang de Boeuf\\", \\"sang de boeuf\\", \\"sang-de-boeuf\\". Typically, outside the larger museums, \\"ox(-)blood\\" is preferred in America, and sang de boeuf in Great Britain. The most common Chinese name for the glaze is lángyáohóng (郎窑红, \\"Lang kiln red\\").Nilsson; Valenstein, 238 Another Chinese name for this type of glaze is niúxiěhóng (牛血红, \\"ox-blood red/sang de boeuf\\").Bruccoleri, para. 10 Chinese sang de boeuf =Origin as imitation of Ming wares= Ming \\"sacrificial ware\\" copper-red dish with the reign mark of Xuande (1426–1435); the colour the Kangxi potters were trying to achieve Sang de boeuf glaze was apparently developed around 1705–1712 in an attempt to recover the lost \\"sacrificial red\\" glaze of the Xuande reign (1426–35) of the Ming dynasty.Nilsson; Valenstein, 238–239; Pollock This was a very famous glaze used for ceremonial (ritual) wares made at Jingdezhen, of which very few examples survive from his short reign. As recorded in the Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty, from 1369, the second year of Hongwu Emperor's reign at the beginning of the Ming dynasty, monochrome porcelains replaced other materials for the ritual vessels used in the official rituals of sacrifices the emperor was required by tradition to perform, hence the name \\"sacrificial red\\". Chinese names for it are xiānhóng (鲜红, \\"fresh red\\") and bǎoshíhóng (宝石红, \\"ruby red\\").Dà Míng Huì Diǎn 大明会典 (Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty), vol. 201. line 310 The statute also states that each colour was associated with a specific direction and ritual: \\"To each direction is associated a porcelain: red for the altar of the Sun, blue for that of Heaven, yellow for the Earth and white for the Moon\\".Dà Míng Huì Diǎn (Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty), vol. 201. Source: line 321–322. Trad. by Bruccoleri (2019). The sacrificial red developed under Xuande ceased to be produced after the emperor's death, and has never been perfectly imitated, despite many later attempts. This suggests the close personal interest some emperors took in the imperial potteries, and also that some secrets must have been restricted to a small group of potters.Vainker, 187–188; Christie's (see \\"Lot Essay\\"), Lot 3108, \\"An extremely rare early Ming copper-red glazed shallow dish\\", Sale 2832, \\"Important Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art\\", Hong Kong, 1 December 2010 =Qing sang de boeuf= Monochrome glazes like sang de boeuf enjoyed a revival in the Qing dynasty, for whom they evoked what were regarded as the high points of historical Chinese ceramics under the early Ming and the Song dynasty (960–1279). They were produced for the imperial court at Jingdezhen alongside completely different styles painted with elaborate designs using newly-expanded palette of colours in overglaze enamels, known as famille rose, famille verte and so on, based on the dominant colour. Initially, much of this production was for sale, often as Chinese export porcelain, where the court preferred simpler decoration.Valenstein, 220–247; Sullivan, 224–228 Where the Xuande sacrificial red pieces have a very subtle mottled coverage, sang de boeuf was produced with a variety of shades of colour and as well as mottling, streaked effects in the glaze, which often fades to white at the top of pieces, and conversely thickens around the shoulders of vases and at the foot, which is often not fully covered by the glaze. There is often crackle,Savage and Newman, 254; Nilsson; Valenstein, 238–239; Battie, 56 and a greenish tinge at the edges of the glazed area, where the glaze is thin. All of these were considered desirable effects. Generally the glaze is only applied to the outside of closed shapes, the inside and rim left with a clear glaze. The red glaze was probably applied by spraying.Sullivan, 226 Other colours that may appear are turquoise, lavender, and purple. The great number of very sensitive variables meant that the glaze colour and effects were initially not reliably controlled by the makers, leaving an element of randomness that appealed to Chinese aesthetics. By the late 18th century more control was possible.Savage and Newman, 254; Ellison, 109; Valenstein, 238–239 File:Water Pot (Shuicheng) with Dragon Medallions LACMA 58.51.1.jpgThe related copper oxide peach-bloom glaze on a Kangxi water pot, also with incised decoration.

His pottery in Stoke- on-Trent specialised in flambé glazes from 1905 till the closure of the business in 1915.Bernard Moore From 1903, the English architect Leslie Green used an industrial, solid, sang de boeuf glaze on the glazed architectural terra-cotta tiles and decorative elements for the exteriors of the stations of a large part of the London Underground system, which was then divided between a number of commercial companies. His employer, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London was building the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, which are now respectively sections of the Piccadilly line, Bakerloo line and Northern line. The Leeds Fireclay Company made the tiles. File:Square vase MET DP315669 (cropped).jpgSquare vase by Ernest Chaplet, French, c. 1889; the Chinese thinning is taken to an extreme.

Reception  New York Tribune critic Heywood Broun remarked: \\"Among the most beautiful of the series. … present cast has an excellent voice. … The singing of John Steel was among the best features of the performance at the New Amsterdam Theatre last night. Particularly in the Irving Berlin number \\"A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody\\" his voice showed to excellent advantage. ... The comedy honors of the evening went very easily to Eddie Cantor. The knockabout sketch \\"At the Osteopath's\\" is among the most amusing bits of violence we have ever seen on the stage. ... Marilyn Miller dances entrancingly and sings very little. She was gorgeous in a minstrel number. ... The appeal to the eye is almost constant and Joseph Urban has never done better. The two tableaux arranged by Ben Ali Haggin are both eminently successful. ... The first night performance suffered from the usual Follies fault of being too long, and the evening was not free of dull spots which might be cut. A long dance number by Maurice and Walton seemed to us a bore. We were somewhat disappointed in Ray and Johnny Dooley. They were funny at times, but though they fall as hard and as often as their relatives at the Winter Garden and the Century Roof, something of the Newtonian inspiration, which possesses William and Gordon, is lacking. Bert Williams was exceedingly funny in a Rennold Wolf sketch, in which he plays the part of the assistant to a sharpshooter, but none of his songs in the first two-thirds of the performance was in the least effective. ... Ziegfeld should receive his annual tribute from those who write for the theatre because in his own field he does his work supremely well. He has been a considerable figure in bringing beauty and taste to American musical shows.\\"Broun, Heywood. \\"Drama: New Edition of The Follies Lives Up To Tradition of Beauty\\", New York Tribune, April 17, 1919, p. 13 The unnamed critic in the Boston Daily Globe wrote: \\"[T]he 1919 version of this 'Institution' proving to be superior to any of the previous dozen produced by the master manager. ... [T]he girls are so pretty and elegantly costumed, the scenes are so beautiful and everything goes with such snap and verve that no one cares to have the style of revue changed. ... The Follies of 1919 is the usual gorgeous, glittering Ziegfeld show, staged lavishly and on an artistic manner and of a higher standard than ever. ... Speed and no lagging moments marked the progress of the show. ... Those agile dancing knock-abouts, Johnny and Ray Dooley, indulged in their hazardous work with as much gusto as though limbs were impervious to breakage. ... The Urban views and pictures by Ben Ali Haggin are strikingly effective, curtains, color schemes and stage accessories, though at times bizarre, appealing strongly to one's sense of harmony. Notably luxurious are 'The Spanish Frolic', the minstrel show, 'Harem Life', 'The Circus Ballet', 'A Syncopated Cocktail' and the finale.\\"\\"Ziegfeld Follies At the Colonial\\", Boston Daily Globe, May 18, 1920, p. 4 Labor unrest and a royal visit During the labor unrest in the summer of 1919, the actors planned to strike. Ziegfeld received an injunction against Actors' Equity, thinking he could avoid a strike. But after the audience was seated on August 13, 1919, Eddie Cantor, Johnny Dooley, Van and Schenck and Phil Dwyer did not show up. Fifteen minutes after the scheduled curtain, the performance was called off.

She was from the Mogami clan, she married Date Terumune and gave birth to Date Masamune. Yoshihime became known as the Demon Princess of the Ouu (奥 羽 の 鬼 姫) due to her personality and her attempts to usurp the power of the Date clan.  Life  Yoshihime was born at Yamagata Castle in Dewa province. When she married Date Terumune, she continued to help the Mogami clan in many ways. She and her brother Mogami Yoshiaki sent many letters to each other, maintaining a good relationship between them. In 1567 she gave birth to Date Masamune, in the following years she gave birth to Date Kojirou, Chikohime and Senshihime. = Conflicts with the Date Clan = She hated her firstborn, Masamune, because of his one-eyed condition, and favored his younger brother Kojirou to succeed clan leadership. The conflicts with Yoshihime got worse when she passed on information to her relatives in the Mogami Clan, even when they were fighting against the Date Clan. In 1578, Date Terumune teamed with other clans at Kaminoyama Castle to attack Mogami Yoshiaki. Yoshihime after learning that her husband had entered battle against her brother, she went on a palaquim to the battlefield, holding a spear, she stood in front of the two armies and forced them to make a peace treaty. She manages to maintain a peace treaty between the two clans. During this time, Yoshiaki continued to seize territories near the Date clan, Yoshihime was aware of her brother's ambition to conquer Tohoku, it is said that she actively assisted him in the plan to kill the leader of the Kaminoyama clan. In 1584 , Masamune succeeded the Date family. In 1585 Terumune was killed by Nihonmatsu Yoshitsugu and she became a widow. Yoshihime suspected Masamune had murdered Terumune to usurp his influence, so she decided to kill Masamune to allow Kojirou to become leader of the Date clan. During this time she was on the warpath with Katakura Kita who was Masamune's mentor and wet nurse. After Terumune's death, Masamune began to advance in various places, he attacked the Shiomatsu clan who was a close ally of the Mogami clan. Mogami Yoshiaki and Masamune strengthened vigilance to initiate a new invasion, conflicts between Date-Mogami was more serious. This exacerbated Yoshihime's position throughout the Date family. Masamune's attacks made Yoshihime uncomfortable, several clans from Mutsu Province allied to defeat Masamune, including the Nikaido clan, where Onamihime (Date Terumune's sister and Masamune's aunt) was the leader. At the Battle of Ozaki in 1588, Masamune moved to attack the Ozaki clan, who were allies of Mogami. Yoshiaki sent reinforcements and surrounded Masamune. Under these circumstances, Yoshihime boarded the battlefield again and stood in between the two armies asking them both to retreat. This time she did this to save her son from her brother, and just as in 1578 her plan worked and the Date army retreated without damage. Yoshiaki felt the peace request was a humiliation, but could not refuse his sister's request. For this reason, both sides are peaceful after the truce for about 80 days. After that, Yoshiaki tried to mediate between Date and Ozaki, but Date was unsuccessful because of distrust. At this time, Yoshiaki asked Yoshihime to take office, revealing that Yoshihime had the confidence of her brother and had the right to speak in the Date family. = The Odawara Incident = In 1590, when Masamune was participating in Toyotomi Hideyoshi's campaign against the Later Hōjō clan at the Siege of Odawara, Yoshihime personally brought Masamune a meal laced with poison. Though Masamune consumed the poison, he was able to counteract it with the antidote. It is reported that the confrontation between the mother and the child reached the peak by this matter, and Masamune killed his younger brother Date Kojiro himself. Even after the murder of Kojiro, Yoshihime remained in the Date family and continued to communicate with his son. There are many theories about the incident, but it is said that Yoshihime was kept in exile. During the time she was in exile, she exchanged letters with her brother and other people. She sent a letter with Korean cotton to Masamune, he was so impressed that he tried to approach his mother. = Departure and return for the Date clan = In 1594 Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the lords of each clan to send their families to Kyoto. Megohime who was Masamune's wife went with Katakura Kita. On November 4, Yoshihime went to Kyoto and then returned to the Mogami clan at Yamagata Castle. In 1600, the Sekigahara Campaign began. At this time, Masamune received reinforcements from Mogami Yoshiaki at Yoshihime's request. Katakura Kagetsuna advised Masamune to wait for the enemy army to be exhausted. The Uesugi clan attacked the Kaminoyama castle that was defended by the Mogami clan, Naoe Kanetsugu manages to take the castle and Mogami's army flees. Masamune sends reinforcements to the security of Yoshihime who was in the middle of the battle. In the Siege of Hasedō, Yoshiaki fights alongside Date clan to repel Uesugi from Yamagata. Tokugawa Ieyasu wins at the Battle of Sekigahara and Uesugi Retreat. After the war, Yoshihime sent a letter of thanks to Masamune. After Yoshiaki's died in 1614, Yoshihime says she lost the whole family. Later, when the Mogami clan was restructured in 1622 after internal conflicts, Yoshihime could no longer maintain her status in the Mogami clan, and asked Masamune to return to Date, which he allowed. She went to live in Sendai Castle and died a year later in 1623 at the age of 76. She sent a gift from the Mogami family to Megohime and made peace with Masamume. In the last year of Yoshihime's life, Masamune knows his mother's intelligence, letters and poems were exchanged between mother and son. Yoshihime dies on August 13, 1623 at Sendai Castle. In Masamune's absence, a funeral was held for her.

Set in Ottawa the novel focuses on Harriet Browning, a writer in her 40s who is obsessed with movies, and a group of her friends and neighbours who live in Old Ottawa South. The title references the 1939 American film Ninotchka which starred Greta Garbo as the titular character and used the phrase \\"Garbo Laughs\\" in promotional materials. Summary Harriet Browning is a novelist in her 40s who has recently moved into a house in Old Ottawa South with her husband, Lew, and their two children Jane and Kenny. Harriet has trouble adjusting to life in Ottawa with her lone friend being her neighbour, Dinah Bloom, a life-long bachelorette and journalist who, like Harriet and her children, has an obsessive love of cinema. Harriet receives a letter from her aunt, Leah, who informs her that she is writing a book on her deceased husband's life in conjunction with her step-son, Jack Frame. Both Jack and Leah decide to come to Ottawa as papers they need for their book are stored at Library and Archives Canada. Harriet has an antagonistic relationship with her aunt, whom she used as material for one of her novels. She is nevertheless persuaded into hosting her and Leah's visit coincides with the January 1998 North American ice storm. Harriet has had a long held flirtation with Jack Frame and finds herself drawn to him once again. At the same time Dinah develops a tumour and her illness causes her attraction to Lew and Lew's attraction to Dinah to become more apparent to both them and their surrounding friends and family. After a tree overburdened with ice falls and kills one of their neighbours Harriet confronts Dinah about her relationship with Lew only for Dinah to tell her that Lew is only seriously interested in Harriet. Meanwhile Jack tries to start an affair with Harriet and she rebuffs him. Dinah convalesces and eventually marries Jack Frame, against Harriet's wishes, and decides to move to Nova Scotia with him. Harriet develops cancer and turns against movies. Shortly before her death she reconnects with them once more thanks to Kenny. The following year after her marriage to Jack Frame collapses Dinah returns to Old Ottawa South. When she re-encounters Lew, Jane senses romance between her father and Dinah.

The church building is dated to the 13th century. Its exterior is adorned with ornamental stone carvings, while the interior contains frescoes. The monastery served as a dynastic abbey of the Dadiani of Mingrelia and housed several Christian relics and icons. The monastery is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  History  The interior. The Khobi church stands at the village of Nojikhevi, some 3 km north of the town of Khobi, Khobi Municipality, in Georgia's Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region. The area is part of the historical and cultural province of Samegrelo (Mingrelia). The first recorded mention of Khobi, then more commonly referred to as Khopi, and its bishop Egnate, occurs in a Georgian document from the Monastery of the Cross, dated to the period between 1212 and 1222. The exact date when the church was constructed is unknown, but the art historian Vakhant Beridze's dating to the latter half of the 13th century has gained traction. The monastery served as a familial abbey and burial ground of the Dadiani, a princely dynasty of Mingrelia. The 17th-century visitors to Mingrelia reported that Khobi was venerated for the Christian relics it contained, such the Virgin May's robe and body parts of the saints Marina and Cyriacus. After a hiatus in the Soviet era, the Khobi church was restored to a Christian use and currently acts as a nunnery.  Layout  A marble capital, a 14th-century spoil of war from Zichia. Khobi is a domeless hall church, with cross-vaults. The northwestern and southwestern corners had been assigned to individual chapels (eukterion), but later both of these were connected to the central bay. The entire length of the western and southern facades is flanked by an open gallery, which terminates in a closed chapel at the eastern end of the south facade. The facades are decorated with carved stonework. The internal walls adorned with a set of frescoes from the 13th–14th century—influenced by the late Byzantine Palaeologan art—and the 17th century. Apart from the religious paintings, there are frescoes depicting members of the Dadiani family, with Georgian inscriptions. A lengthy inscription on the southern chapel, in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, relates that a large collection of marble columns, capitals and fragments of the ambo was brought by Vameq I Dadiani (died 1396) from his victorious campaign against Zichia. These pieces of stonemasonry, some of them of Byzantine origin and dating from the 5th century, are used to decorate the walls of the chapel. Not far from the main church, there is a 14th–17th century bell-tower, ruins of a 17th century episcopal palace, and remains of a circuit wall, restored in a government-run project in 2016.

She was a member of the Arts and Crafts Movement, and worked for the embroidery department of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. She was the sister of Jane Morris and sister-in-law of the artist, designer and poet, William Morris.  Biography  Elizabeth Burden was born in Oxford on 13 December 1841 in Oxford, at Brazier Passage, Holywell. Her birth was registered after a month, on 20 January 1842 at Oxford, and she was baptised on 24 April 1842 in the local St Peter-in-the-East church.Jane's People, Passages and Places: A Walk About Hollywell, Oxford Society of Antiquaries of London, retrieved 2019-08-17 She was the youngest child of Robert and Anne Burden; her siblings were Mary Ann, William and Jane. Burden and her sister Jane are briefly mentioned in Reminiscences of Oxford (1908) by William Tuckwell. As a boy Tuckwell lived opposite the Burden family's cottage, and later occupied a residence next door to the stables were Robert Burden worked. In October 1857, Burden and Jane attended a performance of the Drury Lane Theatre Company in Oxford. Jane, was noticed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones who were members of a group of artists painting the Oxford Union murals, based on Arthurian tales. Struck by her beauty, they asked her to model for them. She sat mostly for Rossetti as a model for Queen Guinevere and afterwards for William Morris who she would later marry in 1859. Jane and William moved to Red House, Bexleyheath in 1860 and began decorating the house in the medieval style. Morris designed a set of 12 large embroideries (referred to as tapestries) based on The Legend of Good Women, by Geoffrey Chaucer. Seven of these panels were completed, mainly embroidered by Jane, with help from Burden. The figure of 'St Catherine', entirely embroidered by Burden, is now in the collection of The Society of Antiquaries: Kelmscott Manor collections and 'Aphrodite', also by Burden, in the collection of The National Trust: Red House. In 1865, a few months before the Morris family left Red House, Robert Burden died and Burden moved in with her sister and brother- in-law. Burden's artistic abilities appear to have extended beyond embroidery, she cut the woodblock for 'Cupid Going Away', one of a series of illustrations to 'The Story of Cupid and Psyche' for the projected edition of William Morris's 'The Earthly Paradise'. The illustrations were engraved on wood by Morris and his friends and associates in the Firm. The project was abandoned in 1868 after trial pages printed at the Chiswick Press did not prove satisfactory. However surviving sets exist in the collections of the William Morris Gallery, the Morgan Library & Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum. By 1871, Burden was living with Jane and William at No. 26 Queen Square, London and working as an embroiderer for William's firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.Jane's People, Passages and Places: A Walk About Hollywell, Oxford Society of Antiquaries of London, retrieved 2019-08-17 William Morris's surviving letters reveals his frustration with living with his sister-in-law. Writing to his friend Aglaia Coronio in November 1872 he complained: > \\"I have been a good deal in the house here- not alone, that would have been > pretty well,- but alone with poor Bessy [sic]: I must say it is a shame, she > is quite harmless and even good, and one ought not to be irritated by her- > but O my God what I have suffered from finding always there at meals & the > like! poor soul 'tis only because she is an accidental person with whom I > have nothing whatever to do...\\" In early 1873, Burden took up a position teaching embroidery at the Royal School of Needlework (RSN), around the same time she moved to 100 Southampton Row, Russell Square, London. She only taught at the RSN for a couple of months before she left, having fallen out with head of the school Mrs Welby, over a misunderstanding regarding the exhibiting of student's work under Burden's name.Hulse, Lynn Elizabeth Burden and the Royal School of Needlework, The Journal of William Morris Studies (Winter, 2014), p.23 Burden later returned to the RSN in April 1875, remaining there until 1877.Hulse, Lynn Elizabeth Burden and the Royal School of Needlework, The Journal of William Morris Studies (Winter, 2014), p.28 In her role as teacher, she popularised a type of tapestry stitch that could be used to great effect for embroidery figures. The stitch was renamed ‘Burden Stitch’ in the School’s Handbook of Embroidery (1880) in recognition of her contribution; a woodcut showing the stitch was also included in the volume on the grounds that the RSN was frequently asked to describe it. At the first exhibition of the newly formed Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1888, Burden exhibited three embroidered figures worked in silk and worsted: 'Helen of Troy', 'Hippolite' and 'Penelope'. Some time after 1901, Burden moved to Redhill, Surrey, where she found a position at Boldrewood, a school for young ladies, most probably giving needlework instruction.

Background  The last Spanish stronghold in Mexico, was Fort of San Juan de Ullua on a small island off the coast of Veracruz. There had been a change in command at the fort during this time, and general Santa Anna, stationed in Veracruz planned a scheme of taking possession of it by feigning the surrender of Veracruz to its new commander. When Echevarri, the captain-general of the local provinces, arrived in Veracruz, he approved of the plan, and agreed to join in on it, positioning his troops in Veracruz to ambush the landing Spaniards, having been promised support by Santa Anna. On October 26th, 1822 as the Spaniards landed however, Santa Anna's troops failed to arrive, and Echevarri barely defeated the landing party, and the Spanish ultimately kept control of the fort. Echevarri expressed his suspicion to Iturbide that it had all been a scheme by Santa Anna to get Echeverri killed as revenge for Santa Anna not having been appointed Captain-General himself. Iturbide himself went to Veracruz to dismiss Santa Anna from his command, not overtly however but rather under the pretext of simply moving him to a different post in Mexico City. However, Santa Anna suspecting his ruin, instead took command of his troops and in December, 1822 started a rebellion in favor of a republican form of government.  Santa Anna Uprising  When Iturbide learned of the rebellion, Santa Anna was declared a traitor, deprived of his rank, and pardon was offered to any of his followers who would return their allegiance to the Empire, within an allotted time. Troops were advanced against the insurgents. Santa Anna meanwhile published a manifesto, and was joined by hero of the independence wars, Guadalupe Victoria. The insurgents began calling themselves the Liberating Army, and were spreading in popularity. Santa Anna was defeated on December 21st when he attacked Jalapa, and even considered flight to the United States, but Victoria assured him, urging him to garrison Veracruz, and telling Santa Anna \\"you can set sail when they show you my head\\"  Resistance of Santa Anna and Battle of Almolonga  Vicente Guerrero and Nicolas Bravo, defected from the ranks of the imperialists, and proceeded to Chilapa on January 5th, 1823 to join the revolution, but experienced a disastrous defeat at Almolonga. The insurrection was mostly being suppressed at this time, Victoria being held in check at Puente del Rey, and Santa Anna still confined at Veracruz. At this point however, opposition to the government began to negotiate with the military. Echevarri was sent to take care of the rebellion in Veracruz, but ended up defecting. On February 1st, 1823 a junta of military chiefs met to proclaim the Plan of Casa Mata. The army pledged itself to restore Congress while disavowing any intention of harming the person of the Emperor, or of overthrowing the Mexican monarchy. On February 14th, Puebla proclaimed for the plan, followed by San Luis Potosí, and Guadalajara. By March, most of Mexico had proclaimed in favor of the plan.  Commanche Alliance  The next day, the 4th Cavalry Regiment, and in the immediate night the rest of the grenadiers on horseback that formed the Emperor's guard joined the rebels, keeping Iturbide with the forces that accompanied him in Ixtapaluca , where he was to cut the communications of the rebels of Puebla and prevent further defections. Iturbide then contacted the Comanche Guonique captain who had traveled to Mexico City to celebrate peace treaties with the government. The Comanche captain offered to raise 20,000 men to defeat the insurgents. However, by then the government had made such concessions to those pronounced that even with all that help it would be difficult to overcome.  Restitution of Congress and talks with the insurgents  Iturbide was then forced to restore the Congress, who in a speech ordered to provide resources to the pronounced, pointing out the points they should occupy, and then carry out an amnesty and thus forget the grievances of the past. Then he believed that that would be enough for the country to return to its tranquility, he left Ixtapaluca and went with his forces to his residence in Tacubaya . Before the demonstrations that made it impossible for the emperor to leave his room and wanted the occupation of the forces of the Liberating Army , the Revolutionary Board of Puebla decided not to recognize the Congress until it moved to a place far from the jurisdiction of the emperor.  Fall of the Empire  It is then that Iturbide abdicates, before the advance of the insurgents on the capital. But by not reaching an agreement on how it would be, the Liberating Army was about to collide with the imperial troops. Iturbide, wanting to avoid the conflict, sent the military commander of the capital, Brigadier Manuel Gómez Pedraza to Santa Marta , where General and Marquis Antonio de Vivanco had located his headquarters, to enter into an agreement with the pronounced. In a war meeting in which Vivanco, Bravo, Echávarri, Miguel Barragán and others were, a 3-article agreement was signed on March 26 , recognizing the character that Congress would grant to Iturbide; that he was free and that he leave Tulancingo with his family escorted by General Bravo on the third day, as Iturbide had requested; and finally, that the troops that had been faithful to him until the end were considered belonging to the liberating army. Thus Iturbide withdrew with his family while the rebels entered the capital. Further reading *RIVA PALACIO, Vicente (1940).

The son of the Reverend Francis Plimley Voules, he was born in January 1843 at Middle Chinnock, Somerset. He was educated at Marlborough College, where he captained the college cricket team. From Marlborough he studied at Lincoln College, Oxford. His debut in first-class cricket came for the Gentlemen of the South against the Gentlemen of the North at The Oval in 1862. He debuted for Oxford University the following year against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Oxford. He played first-class cricket for Oxford until 1866, making sixteen appearances. Playing as an all-rounder, Voules scored 423 runs in his sixteen matches at an average of 19.22 and a high score of 56. With his right-arm roundarm fast bowling, he took 29 wickets at a bowling average of 10.75, with best figures of 7 for 26. These figures, one of two five wicket hauls that he took for Oxford, came against Cambridge in a match winning performance in The University Match of 1863. Voules gained a blue in cricket while playing for Oxford in his freshman year. During his time at Oxford, he also played first-class cricket for the Gentlemen on three occasions between 1863-66 in the Gentlemen v Players fixture, and the for the Gentlemen of England and the MCC once each in 1865. He graduated in 1866 and shortly after became a priest in the Church of England. Voules made his final appearance in first-class cricket in 1867, when he played for Southgate against Oxford University. Prior to taking a clerical post with the church, Voules was employed as a schoolteacher. He was an assistant master at Rossall School in 1869, before becoming an assistant master at Marlborough College in 1873. He was appointed as the principle of Sydney College, Bath in 1874, holding the post until 1879. He took a clerical position as the rector of Ashley in 1879, a position he held until 1894. He moved to Yorkshire in 1894, where he took up the position of rector at Rise. In 1900, Voules returned to Bristol, where he was the rector of Keynsham until 1908. He later served on the council of Marlborough College in 1913. Voules died in London at Maida Hill in May 1923. His brother was Sir Gordon Blennerhassett Voules, a clerk to the admiralty.

He is best known as a member of Elvis Presley's TCB band. He performed on 20 of Presley's recordings and accompanied him on 45 live shows until Presleys' death in 1977. Ogdin's experiences during these tours have been chronicled in a four-part series of video interviews by Billy Stallings. Over a career spanning four decades as a session player, Ogdin recorded with country artists including Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson, George Jones, The Judds, Kenny Chesney, Ray Charles, and Ronnie Milsap. In rock music, he was a member of the Marshall Tucker Band for five years (1984–1989) after departures of some of the original members. He also recorded and performed concerts with the alternative rock band Ween. Career Born in Detroit, Ogdin grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee. As a youth, he studied piano and violin from age 4 to 16 and won a Knoxville Symphony Orchestra music-writing contest. His father was an executive at Robertshaw Controls Company; his sister, Sue Ogdin Lynch, is a visual artist. As a teen, he became interested in rock and roll music and played piano and a Hammond B3 organ in local bands. He graduated from the University of Tennessee and attended law school briefly, but dropped out to pursue a music career. Tom Collins, a Nashville record producer whom Ogdin had known in college, urged him to come to Nashville to explore music opportunities and arranged for him to get some work playing on advertising jingles and demo recordings. He worked his way up to become an in-demand studio player for scores of major artists including Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, The Judds, Travis Tritt, George Jones, Kenny Chesney, Ray Charles, Barbara Mandrell, Dan Hill, Amy Grant and Ronnie Milsap. =With Elvis Presley= In 2018, Ogdin was interviewed by Billy Stallings in a four- part video series chronicling Ogdin's experiences on tour with Presley. These first-hand accounts are the source for the following information. In early 1977, a vacancy opened in Elvis Presley's TCB Band when David Briggs resigned. Ogdin was chosen as his replacement primarily by Briggs and by Elvis' record producer Felton Jarvis, seconded by Bob Beckham. When Ogdin accepted, Jarvis told him there were no charts and no rehearsals. He was given a cassette tape of the show to memorize. There were no sound checks for him to attend; the instruments were transported, positioned and tuned by roadies and sound levels and monitors were done by a crew supervised by veteran sound engineer Bill Porter. Ogdin's debut performance in what would become a series of 45 shows was on March 23, 1977, at Arizona State University in Tempe. He had written himself cue cards to refer to on stage. After the warm-up acts finished, TCB Band members along with the Joe Guercio Orchestra from Las Vegas took their places and began the overture with a dramatic build-up as Elvis appeared and pandemonium followed. Ogdin said, \\"I was the most excited one in the place\\". He saw Presley for the first time only then, and was seated at the front of the stage fairly close to him. Elvis walked over to Ogdin and shook his hand during the initial crowd reaction, acknowledging Elvis' awareness and collegiality toward the new member. Three powerful spotlights on Elvis blinded Ogdin and his cue cards were of no use. Elvis' isolation from the other musicians during those days was near complete, to the extent that no band member had any contact with him except during the actual performances. His schedule was opposite from theirs. When the performance was over, he was immediately taken to his own plane and flown to the next city to spend the night and usually slept until the next afternoon. The band stayed in town after the show and left the next morning. Ogdin said, \\"We stayed in the best hotels and everything was taken care of for us.\\" Wardrobe was provided (seven different pastel outfits) and there was a per diem allowance for food and expenses. In each city, the people there knew this was a big event, and each hotel where the musicians stayed was full of excitement. Ogdin was amused when people asked for his autograph and brought food and gifts for the band. He said, \\"You accepted but never ate the food, and the gifts (usually teddy bears) were collected and donated.\\" Ogdin recalled how they added a new song, \\"Moody Blue\\" to the show. An on-the-road rehearsal was called one afternoon and the musicians assembled at the arena, which was already set up for that evening's show. Felton Jarvis called to the stage an Elvis impersonator whom he had hired. This person sang \\"Moody Blue\\" (imitating Elvis) standing on Elvis' very spot to rehearse the band. On the day Presley died, August 16, 1977, Ogdin was waiting at a private airport in Nashville along with Felton Jarvis, Randy Cullers, J.D. Sumner, members of the Stamps Quartet and others. They were the last pickup for a large plane, already-airborne, containing the Joe Gurcio Orchestra and others from Los Angeles and Las Vegas. After picking up the Nashville group, the plane was to head for Portland, Maine, for a show scheduled on August 17, 1977. Ogdin said, \\"The airport wasn't busy and we were about the only people there. We got the news through the air-traffic controllers that Elvis had died.\\" Shortly thereafter, Felton Jarvis, who was to be on the plane with them, appeared and said simply and succinctly, \\"Elvis is dead, everything is cancelled... go home ... act of God\\". Ogdin said that Felton had just been on the phone with Tom Parker and \\"act of God\\" was a phrase from the musicians' contracts that dealt with financial obligations if some disastrous event occurred. Ogdin opined that it was probably not something Felton would have said, and believed that Tom Parker had told him to make a point of using that phrase. Associated acts The Marshall Tucker Band, one of the major southern rock bands of the 1970s, had an upheaval in 1983 when five of the original seven members quit the band. The two remaining founders, Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks decided to recruit replacements and carry on. They chose primarily studio musicians including Ogdin, bassist Bob Wray, drummer James Stroud, and guitarists Rusty Milner and Ken Mimms. Ogdin played in the group for five years (1983-1988) and recorded the album Still Holdin' On which yielded two country chart singles, \\"Hangin' Out in Smokey Places\\" (No. 44) and \\"Once You Get The Feel of It\\" (No. 79). Bobby Ogdin (far left) with Ween, 2018\\"Ween\\", the duo of Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Gene and Dean Ween, built a cult following with their oddball musical parodies in various genres; however, their recordings, said the New York Times, sounded \\"homemade\\". That changed in 1996 when they came to Nashville to record a country album on Elektra called \\"12 Golden Country Greats \\" (a misnomer since the album contained less than 12 songs). This time they used seasoned session players including Charlie McCoy, The Jordanaires, Hargus Robbins, Russ Hicks, and Bobby Ogdin. The success of this association led to Ogdin's being asked to tour with Ween with a backing unit dubbed \\"Bobby Ogdin and the Shit Creek Boys\\". One of these shows (October,1996) was released as a live album entitled \\"Live in Toronto Canada \\" and he reunited with Ween at a concert Nashville's Ryman Auditorium in 2018. Playing style Ogdin is known musically for his skill in playing to bring out or enhance the vocalist or soloist without overplaying. Although it sounds simple, many otherwise skilled players cannot seem to master it. Barry Beckett, one of the founders of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section and later a Nashville record producer, was asked in an interview, \\"Who would you use for keyboards?\\" His answer: \\"There are three: Matt Rollings, John Jarvis, and Bobby Ogdin. Those three really know taste. They know when not to play. That is probably the most important thing\\".

The company's main assets include the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, CBS Entertainment Group (consisting of the CBS television network, television stations, and other CBS-branded assets), domestic networks (consisting of U.S.-based basic and premium-tier cable television networks including MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, and Showtime), international networks (consisting of international versions of domestic ViacomCBS networks as well as region-specific networks), the Pluto TV ad-supported television streaming service, and the Simon & Schuster book publisher. Headquartered at One Astor Plaza in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, the company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately 700 million subscribers in approximately 160 countries, as of 2020.  Background  In 1952, CBS formed CBS Films, a division which handled syndication rights for CBS's library of television series. This division was renamed CBS Enterprises Inc. in January 1968, and again renamed Viacom in 1970. In 1971, this syndication division was spun off amid new FCC rules forbidding television networks from owning syndication companies. (The rules were abolished completely in 1993.) In 1986, Viacom was acquired by its present owner, theater operator company National Amusements. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Viacom made several acquisitions, including MTV Networks (former Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment) and Paramount Communications. In 1999, Viacom made its biggest acquisition to date by announcing plans to merge with its former parent CBS Corporation (the renamed Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had merged with CBS in 1995). The merger was completed in 2000, resulting in CBS reuniting with its former syndication division. On January 3, 2006, Viacom was split into two companies: CBS Corporation, the former's corporate successor and the spun-off Viacom company.  History  = Formation = On September 29, 2016, National Amusements, the parent company of CBS Corporation and Viacom, wrote to Viacom and CBS encouraging the two companies to merge back into one company. On December 12, the deal was called off. The merger would early be named CBSViacom. On January 12, 2018, CNBC reported that Viacom had re-entered talks to merge back into CBS Corporation, after the merger of AT&T-Time; Warner and Disney's proposed acquisition of most of the 21st Century Fox's assets were announced. Viacom and CBS also faced heavy competition from companies such as Netflix and Amazon. Shortly afterward, it was reported that the combined company could be a suitor for acquiring the film studio Lionsgate. Viacom and Lionsgate were both interested in acquiring The Weinstein Company. Following the Weinstein effect, Viacom was listed as one of 22 potential buyers that were interested in acquiring TWC. They lost the bid, and on March 1, 2018, it was announced that Maria Contreras-Sweet would acquire all of TWC's assets for $500 million. Lantern Capital would later acquire the Studio. On March 30, 2018, CBS made an all-stock offer slightly below Viacom's market value, insisting that its existing leadership, including long-time chairman and CEO Les Moonves, oversee the re-combined company. Viacom rejected the offer as too low, requesting a $2.8 billion increase and that Bob Bakish be maintained as president and COO under Moonves. These conflicts had resulted from Shari Redstone seeking more control over CBS and its leadership. Eventually, on May 14, 2018, CBS Corporation sued its and Viacom's parent company National Amusements and accused Redstone of abusing her voting power in the company and forcing a merger that was not supported by it or Viacom. CBS also accused Redstone of discouraging Verizon Communications from acquiring it, which could have been beneficial to its shareholders. On May 23, 2018, Les Moonves explained that he considered the Viacom channels to be an \\"albatross,\\" and while he favored more content for CBS All Access, he believed that there were better deals for CBS than the Viacom deal, such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Lionsgate, or Sony Pictures. Moonves also considered Bakish a threat because he did not want an ally of Shari Redstone as a board member of the combined company. On September 9, 2018, Les Moonves exited CBS following multiple accusations of sexual assault. National Amusements agreed to make no proposal of a CBS-Viacom merger for at least two years after the date of the settlement. On May 30, 2019, CNBC reported that CBS Corporation and Viacom would explore merger discussions in mid-June 2019. CBS's board of directors was revamped with people who were open to merging; the re-merger was made possible with the resignation of Moonves, who had opposed all merger attempts. The talks had started following rumors of CBS acquiring Starz from Lionsgate. Reports said that CBS and Viacom reportedly set August 8 as an informal deadline for reaching an agreement to recombine the two media companies. CBS announced to acquire Viacom as part of the re-merger deal for up to $15.4 billion. On August 2, 2019, it was reported that CBS and Viacom agreed to merge back into one entity. Both companies came to an agreement on the management team for the merger, with Bob Bakish serving as CEO of the combined company with president and acting CEO of CBS, Joseph Ianniello, overseeing CBS-branded assets. On August 7, 2019, CBS and Viacom separately reported their quarterly earnings as the talks about the re-merger continued. = Beginning of operations = On August 13, 2019, CBS and Viacom officially announced their merger; the combined company was to be named ViacomCBS, with Shari Redstone serving as chair. Upon the merger agreement, Viacom and CBS jointly announced that the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2019, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. The merger must be approved by the Federal Trade Commission. On October 28, 2019, the merger was approved by National Amusements, which then announced the deal would close in early December; the recombined company will trade its shares on Nasdaq under the symbols \\"VIAC\\" and \\"VIACA\\" after CBS Corporation delist its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. On November 25, 2019, Viacom and CBS announced the merger would close on December 4 and begin trading Nasdaq on December 5. On December 4, 2019, Bakish confirmed that the ViacomCBS merger had closed. On December 10, 2019, Bakish announced that ViacomCBS would look to divest Black Rock, the building that held CBS's headquarters since 1964. He stated, \\"Black Rock is not an asset we need to own and we believe that money would be put to better use elsewhere.\\" On December 20, 2019, ViacomCBS agreed to acquire a 49% minority stake in film studio Miramax from BeIN Media Group for $379 million. As part of the purchase, Paramount Pictures reached a long-term deal for exclusive distribution rights to its library, and first-look agreements to co- develop new film and television projects based on Miramax-owned properties. On March 2, 2020, executive vice president Dana McClintock announced that he would depart the company after 27 years in CBS Communications. On March 4, the company announced plans to potentially sell its Simon & Schuster publishing unit, with Bakish arguing that it lacked a \\"significant connection for our broader business.” On June 19, 2020, Jaime Ondarza, formerly the senior vice president of Turner Broadcasting South Europe and Africa, became the new head of ViacomCBS Networks International for France, Spain, Italy, the Middle East, Greece and Turkey. On August 4, 2020, ViacomCBS announced that the connected video advertising platform EyeQ is set to launch in this fall. On September 14, 2020, ViacomCBS announced an agreement to sell CNET Media Group to Red Ventures for $500 million. The deal will include the eponymous CNET tech site, as well as ZDNet, GameSpot, TVGuide, Metacritic, and Chowhound.  Company units  ViacomCBS comprises four major units: * CBS Entertainment Group consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, Big Ticket Television, CBS Television Stations, and CBS Interactive, which includes Giant Bomb, and the CBS All Access subscription video-on-demand service. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T; subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division. * Domestic Media Networks encompasses the pay television channels provided in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix. ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio. * Networks International encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18. This unit also includes all CBS- branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International. * Global Distribution Group focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of CBS Television Distribution, CBS Studios International and ViacomCBS International Studios. Other assets owned by ViacomCBS are the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, over-the-top ad-supported video-on-demand platform Pluto TV, book publisher Simon & Schuster, multi- genre online video conference VidCon, Bellator mixed martial arts promotor, and media and entertainment company AwesomenessTV. As of November 2019, AwesomenessTV is overseen by its co-founder Brian Robbins, an executive for ViacomCBS Domestic.  ViacomCBS International  ViacomCBS International was founded in 1976 as Viacom International Inc. It was in the past a subsidiary responsible for copyrights and trademarks associated with its corporate websites and its cable networks, specifically the Domestic Media Networks division, and the division which licenses the product rights for their various properties. Prior to 1986, Viacom International was the parent company of Viacom Enterprises, and CBS's in-house output pre-1972. Before the first 1999 CBS merger, it also acted as the first Viacom's licensee company for Viacom's owned television stations; for instance New Britain, Connecticut station WVIT, currently an NBC owned-and-operated station for the Hartford market owned by Viacom from 1978 until 1997, took their call letters from Viacom International.

For an adequate golf swing, the player must turn the mouse at certain points to alter the performance of the club head. The Mouse Drive uses precise movements from the computer mouse, and a mouse calibration process must be completed before playing. The game features commentary relating to the player's golfing. Development and release The Golf Pro was developed and published by British company Empire Interactive, and was released for Microsoft Windows. The game was in development in 1996, but its release was delayed. The real golf courses were surveyed for use in the game. The game's courses include elements from their real-life counterparts such as trees and hazards. The game's digitized golfers were video-captured using high-speed film. The Mouse Drive uses 12,000 frames of animation to represent more than 90 potential golf swing variations. The game does not include a traditional click-based swing method, as Empire Interactive felt confident that the Mouse Drive would be adequate on its own. David Pringle, the game's project manager, said, \\"There's only so much you can do with the traditional click-click-click system. […] After using our Mouse Drive system, few players will wish to return to the traditional method.\\" Alistair Cochran was brought in to improve the game physics. Cochran was an expert on golf physics, and was the scientific advisor to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. Pringle described Cochran as \\"basically the expert world-wide on what happens when a club hits a ball.\\" Pringle said he was glad that Cochran worked on the game \\"because it means the ball physics are a lot better than they would have been.\\" In the United States, the game was released on 1 April 1998. The game had also been released in the United Kingdom by that time. At the time of its release, the game did not include a multiplayer feature, although one was intended to be added in later through a patch. Upon release, the game featured computer-controlled golfers for the player to compete against, although they lacked artificial intelligence and their actions were pre-recorded, making their gameplay the same during each round. Reception The Golf Pro was generally praised for its graphics. Some critics also praised the game physics, with Tasos Kaiafas of GameSpot calling them \\"impressively realistic, so much so that the game could be used as an instructional tool.\\" The game was criticized for its limited camera angles, and the small number of courses also received some criticism. Kaiafas was disappointed by the game's graphics, which are pre-rendered. Gordon Goble of Computer Gaming World praised the realism of the Mouse Drive and wrote that The Golf Pro \\"does mouse driving better, and with more innovation and complexity, than the competition.\\" Patrick McCarthy of PC Zone praised the game but stated that players would need to practice the Mouse Drive in order to use it adequately. Kaiafas stated that for players who have the patience to practice using the Mouse Drive, \\"The Golf Pro does present some new challenges that can be fun to master.\\" James Bottorff of The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that the Mouse Drive \\"offers as real a swing as I've seen on the PC. […] This is a welcome change from the traditional three-click approach.\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, \\"For all its complexities, the Mouse Drive isn't that difficult to pick up\\" thanks to the advice given by Gary Player. Jeff Lackey of Computer Games Strategy Plus wrote, \\"If The Golf Pro had come out a couple of years ago, it would have been hailed as an excellent golf sim. In today's environment, it is an average golf sim with a great swing interface.\\" Steve Owen of PC Gamer UK praised the commentary and called The Golf Pro a \\"very accomplished, impressive and enjoyable game, but there is little that is truly astounding or original about it.\\" Owen criticized the difficult putting, and stated that the Mouse Drive would have been an innovative feature in 1996, but that the game's \\"unexpected delay, however, means that everyone else has got there first.\\" In a 1999 review, Mark Hill of PC Zone wrote that \\"there's no excuse for not including an alternative\\" to the Mouse Drive. Hill considered the Links series and the Tiger Woods series superior. The Golf Pro was a runner-up for \\"Best Sports Game\\" in PC Zones 1998 Reader Awards, losing to World Cup 98. The Golf Pro 2 By early 1999, The Golf Pro 2 had been released in the United Kingdom. It features Gary Player and one golf course: Wentworth. Craig Vaughan of PC Zone rated it 70 out of 100, stating that while the name suggests a sequel, \\"The Golf Pro 2 is merely a disappointing course data disc that fails to deliver anything radically new.\\" Vaughan further described it as a \\"half-price, cut- down version of the excellent The Golf Pro.\\" PC Gamer UKs Steve Owen rated it 80 percent and again criticized the putting, while stating that the game seemed like an add-on disc.

They already had a string of hits by 1962, and simultaneously they were establishing themselves as \\"one of the most potent live acts on the R&B; circuit.\\" They released various live albums in the 1960s which did better on the charts than their studio albums.

Background  The rebels commanded by Gral. Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo were defeated by the imperial forces commanded by Gral. José Gabriel de Armijo.Guerrero Flores and Ruiz Ham, 2012, p. 25. Emperor Agustín de Iturbide did not hesitate to send General José Gabriel de Armijo to the command of all the forces of the South, since he, as an ex-royalist military, had had experience fighting against Guerreros forces as in the Battle of Cerro de Barrabás.  Battle  During the battle, finishing his passage through the realistic company of Jiutepec , which Guerrero faced directly, being shot in the lung, and, believing him dead, his troops began to flee in disorder. In order to realize the imperial victory, along with Gen. Epitacio Sánchez advanced the cavalry, however in the first meetings, General Sánchez was shot dead in the head. The death of the chief generated the slow withdrawal , abandoning his artillery, without which the rebels could get the loot because they escaped. Guerrero was rescued by a soldier on horseback, hid it in a ravine, and then recovered at the home of a local Indian, becoming ill all his life. Bravo withdrew with the few troops that had not escaped Putla. In the part of José Gabriel de Armijo who sent from Chilapa declared Guerrero dead, ending his campaign.

He was a rival of , Mitsubishi's last president before the dissolution of the zaibatsu and first president after its reconstitution. Arrest in London Having received a scholarship from , eldest son of Mitsubishi Corporation's founder Iwasaki Yatarō, Makihara and his wife Haruko went to Hampstead, London in 1927 as head of the Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha office. Their only child, a son was born there in 1930. After some time elsewhere they returned to London in 1937. On Friday 2 August 1940, Makihara and several others were arrested on suspicion of espionage, and taken to Brixton prison. Thanks to intervention by the Japanophile (and pro-Japanese spy) Lord Sempill and others, he was released a few days later, on Monday 5 August, due to \\"insufficient evidence\\". Return to Japan and death Mitsubishi closed their London office in October 1940, whereupon Makihara returned to Tokyo, becoming General Manager of the company's Marine Products Division.

Prior to his appointment, Hamdok served in numerous national and international administrative positions. From November 2011 to October 2018, he was Deputy Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). UNECA staff described Hamdok as \\"A diplomat, a humble man and a brilliant and disciplined mind\\". In August 2019, Hamdok was floated around as a likely candidate for Prime Minister of Sudan for the 2019 Sudanese transition to democracy. Following the transfer of power from the Transitional Military Council to the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, the Sovereignty Council appointed Abdalla Hamdok as Prime Minister during the transitional period. He was sworn in on 21 August 2019. Education Abdalla Hamdok holds a bachelor of science from the University of Khartoum and a doctorate in economic studies from the University of Manchester. Early and international career From 1981 to 1987, Hamdok was a senior official in the Sudanese Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. In the 1990s, Hamdok held senior positions first at Deloitte & Touche and then at the International Labour Organization in Zimbabwe, followed by several years at the African Development Bank in Côte d'Ivoire. Hamdok was the Regional Director for Africa and the Middle East of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance from 2003 to 2008. Hamdok worked briefly for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) in 2001 and 2002 as Director of Regional Integration and Trade and from 2011 to October 2018 was the Deputy Executive Secretary of UNECA. UNECA staff described Hamdok as \\"a true Pan-Africanist, a diplomat, a humble man and a brilliant and disciplined mind\\". In September 2018, Hamdok was named as Minister of Finance under the Omar al-Bashir presidency of Sudan, but refused the nomination. Prime Minister of Sudan Hamdok with Steven Mnuchin at U.S. Treasury in 2019 Suggestions were made in June 2019 by a spokesperson of the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) and in August 2019 by The Sudan Daily that Hamdok would be proposed as Prime Minister of Sudan by the FFC, which negotiated the 2019 Sudanese transition to democracy with the Transitional Military Council. The transition procedures were formally defined in the Political Agreement signed on 17 July 2019 by the FFC and TMC and the Draft Constitutional Declaration signed by the FFC and the TMC on 4 August 2019. The Sovereignty Council of Sudan appointed Hamdok to be Prime Minister on 20 August, as required by the Draft Constitutional Declaration. He was subsequently sworn in on 21 August. Under Article 19 of the August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, as a minister during the transitional period, Hamdok is forbidden (along with other senior transition leaders) from running in the 2022 Sudanese general election scheduled to end the transitional period. As prime minister, Hamdok selected a cabinet of ministers. On 4 October 2019, he purged the leadership of public Sudanese universities, dismissing 28 chancellors and 35 vice-chancellors and appointed 34 vice- chancellors. The aim was to replace people in positions of power representing the al-Bashir government. =Assassination attempt= On 9 March 2020, Hamdok survived an assassination attempt in the capital Khartoum. The culprit(s) has yet to be publicly identified. At least 3 vehicles were damaged in the attempt, but there were no human casualties except for one security officer who was \\"lightly wounded.\\" Views =Agriculture= Hamdok has pushed for a change from subsistence agriculture to \\"more dynamic, commercial oriented\\" agriculture in Africa, stating in 2014 that Africa was capable of food self- sufficiency, but that 300 million Africans were hungry. Referring to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) estimate of the effects of a 2-degree Celsius global average warming above pre-industrial levels, Hamdok noted that effects such as reduced rainfall could prevent Africa from reducing extreme poverty. To combat hunger, Hamdok proposed infrastructure improvements (such as methods of transforming, storing and transporting excess produce to markets); the use of \\"climate information\\"; improved water management; and greater integration of agriculture with national industry and science and technology research institutions. =Women's rights= As Prime Minister, Hamdok had the role in late August 2019 of selecting ministers from a list of candidates proposed to him by the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), apart from the Ministers of Interior and Defence, to be chosen by military members of the Sovereignty Council. Hamdok delayed his decision on which candidates to select, stating that one his reasons for objecting was that too few women were present on the list. He stated that he would \\"take into account a fair representation of women\\". Four women became ministers in the Hamdok Cabinet: Asma Mohamed Abdalla as Foreign Minister, Lina al-Sheikh as Minister of Social Development and Labour, Wala'a Essam al-Boushi as Minister for Youth and Sports and Intisar el-Zein Soughayroun as Minister of Higher Education. In November 2019, the government of Sudan repealed all laws restricting women's freedom of dress, movement, association, work and study. Hamdok praised women in a message published on social media, saying that the laws were \\"an instrument of exploitation, humiliation, violation, aggression on the rights of citizens.\\" In 2020, Hamdok passed a law to prohibit female genital mutilation. The change is an amendment to Sudan's Criminal Law Article 141. The act is defined as removing or mutilating \\"the female genitalia by cutting, mutilating or modifying any natural part of it leading to the full or partial loss of its functions.\\"  Personal life  Hamdok married fellow economist Muna Abdalla in 1993 in south Manchester. They have 2 grown-up sons; one studying at Exeter University and one who graduated from a university in the United States in the late 2010s.

The desiccant absorbs moisture from the air leaving the cold surface, releasing heat and drying the air, which can be used in a process requiring dry air. The desiccant is then dried by an air stream at a lower relative humidity, where the desiccant gives up its moisture by evaporation, increasing the air's relative humidity and cooling it. This cooler, moister air can then be presented to the same cold surface as above to take it below its dew point and dry it further, or it can be expunged from the system.Cromer cycle The desiccant undergoes a reversible process whereby in the first part of the cycle, it absorbs or adsorbs moisture from air leaving a cold surface, releasing heat, and then in the second part of the cycle evaporates moisture, absorbing heat and returning the desiccant to its original state to complete the cycle again. The result of the Cromer cycle is that the process air leaving the cycle is dehumidified further (higher latent ratio) than it would be leaving the cold surface without the cycle. The Cromer cycle concept was originally patented in the mid-1980's. Those patents have expired and thus the cycle is free for anyone to use. The cycle was first publicized in 1997 by Popular Mechanics in its Tech Update section.Popular Mechanics, Vol 174, No 1, Jan 1997, p.26 Psychrometrics The Cromer cycle is primarily used in air conditioning and drying applications. The cold surface portion of the cycle is most often a result of a reversed Carnot or refrigeration cycle. For the Cromer cycle to operate, a desiccant must be exposed to two air streams, one with higher humidity from a cold surface, and one with lower humidity to dry it. This is most easily accomplished by moving the desiccant. Any cycling mechanism can be used, such as pumping a liquid desiccant, however an easy mechanical application is a rotating wheel, loaded with desiccant, through which the different air streams pass. This is shown in Figure 1 where a desiccant wheel has been applied to a standard air conditioning set-up.psychrometric chart, the air flow state points of the Cromer cycle are shown. The psychrometric process of the air passing through the system with four state points is shown on the psychrometric chart of Figure 2 as 1, 2, 3 and 4. The state points of the air are also depicted in Figure 1. In this application, the air returning from the space, typically around 50% relative humidity (RH), is presented to the desiccant wheel and dries the desiccant. The air picks up moisture and cools in process 1 to 2. The moist air is now presented to the cooling surface (cooling coil of the air conditioner), which cools it below its dew point and dries the air in process 2 to 3. This represents the work done by the cold coil. In the meantime, the dried desiccant from below is rotated to the upper air stream. The saturated air leaving the coil, typically 93–98% RH, is presented to the desiccant at 3, where the air is dried further in process 3 to 4, where it is presented to the space as supply air. The desiccant, now loaded with moisture, rotates to the return air, where the cycle repeats. Typical cooling and drying by the cold coil without the Cromer cycle is depicted on the psychrometric chart and is also shown in Figure 2. State point 1 is the air that returns from the space to the system (return air). For a typical air conditioning system, this air at state point 1 enters the cooling coil and leaves at about state point 4' after cooling and drying. State point 4' represents the temperature and moisture content of the air that leaves the typical unit, about and 95–98% RH. Changes to a standard AC system by the Cromer cycle The psychrometric chart depicts the changes of the cycle to the standard air conditioning cycle. First, the end state point 4 for air from the wheel represents a latent ratio increase (moisture removal) to about 45%, as opposed to the 25% of the typical coil shown. Secondly, the air quality delivered by the cycle is much dryer, about 55% RH (state point 4), rather than 98% with the standard coil (state point 4'). Third, this is accomplished with a higher average evaporator temperature. Compare the midpoint of the evaporator's temperature, line 1 to 4’, to the midpoint of the Cromer cycle’s evaporator’s temperature, line 2 to 3. These lines represent the work done by the coil on the air stream (its change in enthalpy). This is significant because, given a constant condenser temperature and equivalent change in enthalpy, the higher the evaporator coil temperature, the more efficient is the Carnot refrigeration cycle and the greater the energy efficiency a particular system can deliver. Common dehumidification strategies include: reheating (electric or hot-gas bypass), where sensible heat is added to the air leaving the equipment; recuperative heat (run-around coils or heat pipes), where sensible heat is transferred from the return air to the supply air; or the Cromer cycle, where the latent heat of moisture sorption and evaporation is transferred from the return air to the supply air. These various strategies were compared in an ASHRAE Journal article that found that \\"the Cromer cycle produces similar enhanced dehumidification performance as is obtained with recuperative configurations.\\"Dieckmann,J.,McKenney,K.,Brodrick,J.,\\"Energy- Efficient Dehumidification: Vapor Compression, Cromer Cycle\\";ASHRAE Journal, Vol 51, No 8,Aug. 2009,pp 78-80 Desiccants used To operate in this cycle, the desiccant is required to absorb moisture from air coming off of the coil that is colder and about 98% RH and to desorb moisture to air that is warmer and at a lower RH. The desiccant is regenerated by the vapor pressure differential inherent in the RH differences rather than heat or temperature difference. Desiccants that have a moisture sorption isotherm of the type shown in Figure 3 (Type III) are common, such as many formulations of silica gel. Type III desiccants absorb little moisture below 70% RH but many will take up more than their own weight in water from the air when presented with over 90% RH. The absorption isotherm is very steep between 90 to 100% RH. Desiccants of Type III have plenty of potential for the cycling of moisture from the air off of the coil, around 98% RH, over to the return air stream, typically around 50% RH. Field tests In 2011, Khalifa, Al-Omran, and Mohammed reported on a monitored study of a 2-ton capacity air conditioner unit while exchanging out a silica gel wheel and a wheel made of activated carbon to determine if it would reduce the relative humidity in a small room in Baghdad when compared to the unit without the Cromer cycle added. They found that the \\"Cromer cycle can reduce the indoor relative humidity from 80% to about 60% using active carbon of 5 cm wheel thickness.\\"Khalifa, A. , Al- Omran, A. , Mohammed, H., EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF AIR CONDITIONER UNIT PERFORMANCE USING CROMER CYCLE, AL-TAQANI. 24. E1-E13, 2011. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323323036_EXPERIMENTAL_STUDY_OF_AIR_CONDITIONER_UNIT_PERFORMANCE_USING_CROMER_CYCLE Incorporating fresh air exchange To maintain indoor air quality, it may be desirable to expunge return air from the conditioned space and replace it with fresh outdoor air, sometimes called \\"make-up air.\\" The optimal location to expunge return air from a Cromer cycle system is just after the desiccant (location 2 on Figure 1). At this point, the return air has been loaded with moisture from the desiccant, and expunging it removes additional moisture from the space. Furthermore, this expunge air is cooled below the return air condition by the desiccant's evaporation of the moisture into it. Location 2 (but before the fan) is also the ideal place to bring outdoor air into the system, as the coil can then reduce its temperature and moisture before it enters the space. Also, if heat exchange is provided between the expunged air and the outdoor air, the incoming air can be cooled and brought near to or at saturation before it enters the cooling coil for process 2 to 3, enhancing its dehumidification.Clark,J.; “Energy-Efficient Supermarket Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning in Humid Climates in the United States”; National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Boulder, CO; Technical Report, March 2015, NREL/TP-5500-63796,p 88; https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63796.pdfKosar, D; Gulubovic, M; Khadir, M; Judge ,J; Swami, M; Shirey, D; Raustad, R; Basarkar, M; Novosel,D; “Integrating Advanced Humidity Control to Reduce Energy Use”; Final Report – Task 6; NCEMBT-070621; 2007; National Center for Energy Management and Building Technologies; Washington, DC; United States Department of Energy; p22 https://www.nemionline.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/Kosar_D_Integrating_Advanced_Humidity_Control_To_Reduce_Energy_Use_NCEMBT-070621.pdf Dehumidifier When the process needed is more dehumidification or drying, the Cromer cycle can be enhanced by using the free heat available from the condensing side of the reverse Carnot refrigeration cycle. This heat, sometimes called \\"hot gas bypass\\" can be added before the desiccant wheel to enhance the drying of the wheel at location 1 of Figure 1 (but after the filter), called pre-heat. Hot gas bypass heat can also be added to the process at location 4, called reheat, which delivers warmer but even lower RH supply air. Either one or both hot gas bypass locations can be used. When a Cromer cycle air conditioning system is enhanced with hot gas bypass, it is typically referred to as \\"active\\" Cromer cycle air-conditioning. When the cycle is used as equipment designed for dehumidification or drying, it is typically called a Cromer cycle dehumidifier or Cromer cycle dryer.

It is directed by Danny Mulherson, and stars Tongan-Kiwi actor Mosese Veaila as the protagonist, and Craig Hall former All Blacks and current Warriors team doctor, Dr. John Mayhew, and Kelson Henderson stars as Phil Kingsley Jones, Lomu's former manager. It aired on TV Three on August 18 and 19, 2019, and is also available On Demand for one year. It is the first feature-film-length mini series to feature Tongan dialogues.  Plot  = Part 1 = The story begins in 1996 after Lomu's meteoric rise to the sporting world, where footages of Jonah Lomu trampling Mike Catt marked his first major moment that launched him to international super-stardom. It helped him move his partner, Tanya Rutter, from South Africa to New Zealand, who later became his first wife. However, his immediate playing future in New Zealand is unknown, and with the debut of Super 12, he signed to join Eric Rush back in Auckland Blues. Moments after signing his first contract, Lomu found blood in his urine, which signalled his first sign of his health troubles ahead. The movie then had a flashback in South Auckland in 1987, where a rapidly-growing Jonah (12) grew out of his church uniform that he just got from last week, and much like devout Christians, Jonah has been taught to never wander outdoors and play or work on Sabbath Sundays, but their cousin, Drew, managed to lure him away to hang out with his bicycle gang, where Jonah managed to steal a bicycle of his own from a motorbike gang leader. Despite not being the instigator, Jonah was more severely punished as he was the oldest in the family, and his anger and resentment toward his strict father grew. It drove him to join the Crips bicycle gang, which is Drew's gang. However, his first test mission to hide a knife failed, as he was busted by the cops. He also accidentally stabbed himself on the thigh while running into a ditch, and lied about him being attacked by Bloods. However, Semisi still found out, leaving him disappointed and wished he left Jonah in Tonga. A few days later, Drew was killed in another rivalry gang fight. Days later, Hepi convinced Semisi to send the boys to Wesley College in Pukekohe in 1988, despite them not being able to make ends meet. Throughout his third form, his raw and natural talent for sports was slowly discovered by Mr. Chris Ginter, the college's disciplinary teacher and PE teacher, having gained first place in long jump, discus, javelin, high jump and shot put, despite not entering decathlon outright. He also went on to win the 100m sprint, which gained him positive popularity in the school. He was recruited to play first XI rugby union in a traditionally rugby union powerhouse, but Jonah initially declined, since Jonah grew up in South Auckland, where touch rugby and rugby league dominates the area. A few months after, he left school grounds without permission to play rugby league for Mt. Wellington U-21, which caused him to be expelled, but later relented since Jonah's home situation is bad. Jonah started his rugby career as a flanker, lock and halfback due to his size and strength, but as he learns the difference between the two codes, and gaining respect from the seniors. After a time-skip to 1993, when Jonah became a senior at 18, he was already a try-scoring lock, and already had a taste of Sevens rugby, where his agent and manager, Phil Kingsley Jones, made first promises of his future. Time returns to 1996 after his blood urine, he had doubts about marrying Tanya due to his parents' disapproval, so he went public in Paul Holmes' talk show, but after being hounded by paparazzi, he finally snapped and punched a photographer. A month later, he won his first Super 12 title with The Blues despite only scoring 3 tries, and met John Hart, but a few weeks later, first signs of his illness showed. He had a lacerated shin that didn't heal, and losing aerobic fitness. He struggled to keep his kidney problems a secret from the coaches and Eric Rush, his roommate. While the initial set of urine tests were lost, the next set came back inconclusive, so Jonah decided to hold off until he manages to play in 1996 All Blacks Tour of South Africa. After being left out of the first match against the home team, he went out with the team, but was sucker-punched in a random attack. A few months later, a nephrology specialist cleared him for Barbarians tour in the UK, but he had the worst outing thus far with the All Blacks, having committed 3 turnovers, and failing to break away from anybody. He was formally diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome late in 1996. When he started receiving treatment in 1997, he watched an old tape of him playing in 1994, the year when Laurie Mains suggested him to move from lock/flanker to a left winger, a trial in Counties Manukau was a successful experiment. However, since rugby in New Zealand was not a professional sport at the time, he briefly worked at ASB Bank. In 1997, his health condition improved enough that his kidney problems are in remission, and has made his return for the All Blacks, but his relationship with Tanya soured, as he cheated on her, and was in a relationship with Fiona, a PA, leading Lomu to cede most possessions and caring rights their pet dog, Toby Jack. The movies jumps back to 1994, when Jonah impressed in the Possibles vs. Probables trial match., which leads to his debut in Christchurch's Lancaster Park against France. Part one ends with Jonah practising the Maori haka while overlooking the Christchurch skyline. = Part 2 = After a shaky debut in 1994, and struggling to adjust to the move to left wing, Lomu vents his frustrations to Phil Kinglsey Jones, and feels dejected when he returns to ASB Bank to work a day later. Despite being dropped, he receives a fax from Sydney Bulldogs, an Australian professional rugby league team. Apprehensive about the move to Australia, he seeks advice from Eric Rush, who suggested him to treat the 1995 North-South Prossibles vs. Probables trials match as a swansong, in case if he did decide to switch code and get a professional contract. After Jonah's great performance, however, Eric and Frank suggested him to stay with the All Blacks, then make his mark in the 1995 World Cup, so there would be more options for him after the Cup. Before the World Cup, however, his fitness already came into question, as Laurie Mains was known to build on the team's cardio fitness and endurance, two things that Lomu lacks. He initially brushed it off as he isn't 'built for long-distance', which may be true, but the blood test already showed impaired renal function while Jonah's medical insurance was being processed. He also put on some weight, despite showing no physical changes. Time skips to 1999, ahead of the World Cup knockout stages, incidentally against France, the same opponent he faced on his debut. With his kidney problems in remission, he was in the best shape he could be. However, after the team was knocked out, despite him scoring 2 tries, Fiona was too scared to see Grant Kereama, who would become Jonah's kidney donor years later. He was hassled by some regular customers, fearing an attack, Nadine Quirk's father pulled him aside and treated him to a pasta meal. Nadine later becomes Jonah's third and final wife. In 2000, Teina was attacked by a crazed female fan in Wellington, leading him to never party out at night much. Time returns to 1995, Lomu actually shows first signs of his kidney problems after gaining weight by retaining more fluid. When the team lands in South Africa for 1995 Rugby World Cup, the press is still sceptical about his position change to left wing, having started off as a flanker. To reaffirm his commitment, he shaved his eyebrow with the 11 gap, the squad number for a left-winger. Time returns to 2002, when Fiona was asking about Jonah's wedding plans with Teina, it fell through 2 weeks before that wedding, and like last time, Lomu ceded his house and cars to her, while he moved in with Fiona. While Kingsley tried to make a damage-control press again, Fiona, a more astute businesswoman with a business degree, saw through him trying to siphon money out of Jonah. They let Kingsley walk, and he was relieved of his duties as Jonah's manager after a decade. While Fiona was looking through a new contract deal, Jonah felt unwell, a checkup revealed that .a dialysis treatment actually strains the heart, so while his kidney may be better, a heart attack may still be possible. When he started, he met Penina, a fellow diabetic, but throughout his treatment, only Frank Bunce saw him, but even he was taken aback by the equipment and Jonah's plight. A few weeks later, as Penina passed away, he decided to propose to Fiona. A few weeks later, he returned to play for Wellington Hurricanes in 2003. He already lost his explosive power, and can only be a holding defender as he cannot afford to perform full strength solo tackles. Those are compounded by his minute restrictions. He later conceded that he needed to consider retirement. Time returns to 1995, and footages of the real Jonah against Ireland was shown, where he scored two tries on his World Cup debut match, and Eric Rush answered most answers for him, as he became increasingly uncomfortable with dealing with the press, so Chris Ginter conducted a pre-recorded interview with him. There, Jonah recounted his rough childhood, and fully disclosed he physically fought back against his father. Fearing that the media could backlash, Jonah was simply telling the raw and ugly truth. Time skips to 2004, with his rugby career nearly over, he was playing Grand Turismo 4 on PlayStation 2 and trying to get Fiona's jacket, he tripped, but was unable to feel his feet. Having lost 90% of sensations on his feet, he let pride get in the way and tried to walk down stairs, and tripped again. He later conceded that he needed a wheelchair, and he lost the ability to drive because he no longer has the ability to sense which pedal he was pressing. Grant Kereama still offered to donate his kidney after finding they both have O+-type blood, and other test also came back showing the matches, so Grant could become a live donor for Jonah. Four months after the transplant, where the transplanted kidney is placed inside the rib cage, so it can be protected from the tackles and hits. In 2005, he made his return at Twickenham to play in an invitational match with Martin Johnson, but he dislocated his left shoulder in a tackle, and his glenohumeral joint was worn off. In 2007, Jonah met Nadene in a club, but just like his breakup with Tanya, Jonah tried to deny and ignore everything, but a more astute Fiona tried to reason with him, and also tried to convince him to take it easy and retire from rugby. Like last times, he gave away the house and cars, except for his original Ford Mustang. When he drove off, he lost control, but he didn't crash. A few months later, he visits John's family house, but he left Nadine sleeping in his car. A few weeks later, she was working in a night club, and as she is a teetotal, she thought her juice was spiked, she is correct that the juice was spike with Rohypnol, a powerful sleeping pill, but it turns out that she is pregnant, even when Jonah was deemed infertile, and Nadine had one of her ovaries removed. Unlike the last marriages, Jonah's family was pleased for Jonah, and are happy that they are finally becoming grandparents, and are receptive to the fact that the children will grow up in Wellington, Nadine's hometown. As the family was extended, they finally got married. Time returns to 1995, after the quarter final win, the night that was on Sean Fitzpatrick's birthday, where the story of him meeting Tanya was revealed, but the first meeting was cut short as she was led out by her friends. He then came to a bar session, where he discovered that he was on Rupert Murdoch's radar, which could launch his brand and increase media exposure, as Murdoch is a media mogul that later launched rugby into the profession era, as players used to be on semi-professional or even amateur status, hence many players needed to work in regular jobs to stay afloat. There, he and Tanya faced racial profiling by the South African police during Apartheid era, but when the cop realised the car was not a stolen car, and realised it was Jonah, he asked for an autograph. He was happy that he finally had no need to fear the cops due to his star power. In the semi final against England, real-life footages of Lomu trampling Mike Catt, and going on to score 4 tries was shown. However, time skips to 2011, when a frail Jonah is on his way to hospital in Auckland, because the body rejected Grant's donated kidney, and was resuscitated after he went into renal failure. He had outlived his 10 years life expectancy from the start of dialysis. In 2015, footages of Jonah's final public appearances were shown, where Prince Harry presented the World Cup in 2015 after the team defended the World Cup in England. As he left the locker room, his friends, family and coaches worked around him. As he sees his current wife and his children, he morphed back into his younger self, and stepping out onto the field. As the screen darkens, his short obituary was shown.

However, Phil Kingsley Jones' relationship with Jonah was not divulged in great detail, and many intimate details of Lomu's love life was also left out, as both he and Laurie Mains were not consulted in the making of the series, and leaving the public presuming the minute details as public knowledge.

Science Advances, 1 Nov 2019: Vol. 5, no. 11, is an archaeological site consisting of a cave with remains of Neanderthals near Oliva, in the Province of Valencia, Spain. The most complete skeleton of a Neanderthal ever found on the Iberian peninsula was found there in 2010. One of the Neanderthals whose remains were found in the cave used a toothpick to alleviate pain in his teeth caused by periodontal disease and dental wear. Location and description The karst cave is located southeast of the village of Oliva, at from the coast of the Mediterranean, and archaeological excavations have taken place since 1977. The cave is found in a low hill, one of a group of hills called the Muntanyetes de Oliva, the last part of the Serra de Mustalla before the floodplain that ends at the coast. It has been occupied since the Middle Paleolithic, including in the Mousterian and Mesolithic periods, and in the Bronze Age. Its environment was rich and varied, with mountains on one side and lagoons on the other. Archaeological finds A maxilla (almost complete, with a number of teeth), a molar, a fibula, and four fragments of a cranium belonging to two humans were found between 2000 and 2003, in what appeared to be a layer from the Mousterian. All fragments except for the molar were from an adult, who died at between 35 and 45 years old; the molar was from a child of around 2.5 years old. The maxilla showed periodontal disease and heavy dental wear, which must have caused considerable pain; there was a significant gap (8.05 mm for the canine) between the teeth and the alveolar bone. The person attempted to alleviate the discomfort with a toothpick, as evidenced by two grooves on the distal surface of two of the remaining teeth: \\"the habit of using a tool to pick the teeth may be considered early evidence of medical treatment to alleviate sore gums\\". In 2010, in further excavations on the same spot where the maxilla was found, an almost complete skeleton of a Neanderthal was found, the most complete skeleton (with the bones still attached to the spine) ever found on the Iberian peninsula. In 2019, it was reported that archeologists found a necklace featuring eagle claws, which suggests symbolic purposes.Eagle Talon Jewelry Suggests Neanderthals Were Capable of Human-Like Thought.

Early life and education  Catharine Crozier was born in Hobart, Oklahoma to the Rev. Walter Stuart Crozier and Alice Condit Crozier. As a child, she studied violin, piano, and organ, and made her first public appearance on the piano at age six. She studied at Central High in Pueblo, Colorado from 1927 until 1931. For college, she attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. Studying with Harold Gleason, she earned a bachelor's degree and a Performer's Certificate in 1936 and a master's degree and Artist's Diploma in 1941. She and Gleason married in 1942.

The date of foundation is unknown, although it is believed that it was populated by Iberians. The name is Roman and means \\"dove\\". At present, the village has about 300 inhabitants, because it never recovered from two natural disasters that occurred at the end of the 19th century: the phylloxera plague, a disease that affected the vineyards, and a strong earthquake, which badly affected the economy and made many people emigrate. It is located at an altitude of , which results in great views in all directions, including views of the Mediterranean Sea. Corumbela has landscapes in which you can fully enjoy the splendor of nature, since it is right beside the Sierras of Tejeda, Almijara and Alhama Natural Park. History In 1493 the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, after completion of the conquest of the Emirate of Granada, gave Corumbela as payment for services to Diego Fernández de Córdoba y Mendoza, 3rd Count of Cabra. Afterwards it belonged to the Ducal House of Medinaceli, which owned the Estate until 1811 when the Cortes of Cádiz prohibited the lordships. From 1811 until 1868 it had its own council. In 1867 there was a regrouping into new municipal units in which Corumbela became part of the municipality of Sayalonga, where the Town Hall is located today. Monuments  The most important monument in Corumbela is without doubt its Church, which has a Mudéjar art minaret. The church has all the characteristics of once being a mosque, but the Minaret most faithfully preserves the Mudéjar architecture. It is built of masonry, with thick flat stones crossed by brick courses. Its interior is well preserved. Another place to visit in Corumbela is \\"Las 3 Fuentes\\" (The 3 Springs), where natural and crystalline water runs. It is here where people gathered to collect drinking water. This is located on the outskirts of the town. Gastronomy  Corumbela has rich agriculture and gastronomy. Its cuisine is very rich and varied, particularly fennel stew washed down with a good local wine. The blood sausages are very good as well as the cateto bread, made in a traditional wood oven. Festivals *The Corumbela festival is held in honor of San Antón on the first weekend of July. For this, the village publishes an advertising book with the companies and businesses in the area, including the program for the 3 days, which is distributed by the town and the establishments weeks before the festival takes place. *Holy Week in Corumbela has its main activity on three days: on Holy Thursday Our Lady of Sorrows and the Nazareno del Perdón leave in procession. On Good Friday, Our Lady of Sorrows and the Crucified Christ make their exit and finally on Easter Sunday the Risen Christ comes out accompanied again by Our Lady of Sorrows.

A major name in American theater, he is renowned for his innovative stagings of plays and musicals by Sam Shepard, Eugene O'Neill, Amiri Baraka. He has taught Theater at Columbia University, Yale University and New York University. He co-founded the Impossible Ragtime Theater in 1975 with Pam Mitchell, Ted Story and Cynthia Crane. Ferencz is known for his extensive work with La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club where he was a resident director from 1982 to 2008. He has directed 19 Shepard productions including Shep’N’Rep (1979), Cowboy Mouth (1981), The Tooth of Crime (1983), and Shepard Sets (1984); the latter began Ferencz’s collaborative partnership with drummer/composer Max Roach. Ferencz’s other Off-and Off-Off-Broadway credits include Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie (1975), Paris Lights (1980), Battery (1981), Money: A Jazz Opera (1982), Harm’s Way (1985), Welcome Back to Salamaca (1988), Conjur Woman (2008), and Prague, 1912 (2017). Biography =Early life= Born in Cleveland, he is the son of George and Anne Ferencz, the eldest of 6 siblings. Wanting to pursue a career as a writer, he became editor of the school newspaper at Padua High, an all-boys school. The first in his family to graduate from college, Ferencz got his degree in theatre from Kent State University. He moved to New York in 1970 and began studying directing with Gene Frankel and then with Carl Weber. When Ferencz arrived in New York City in 1970, he and his first wife Pamela Mitchell created the Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound Roadshow with Tim and Deirdre McDonald, in association with Scollia Productions. Ferencz wrote, directed, and produced the youth theater performances which ran tours of the eastern seaboard and Washington, D.C. area, culminating in a performance at The White House for Pat Nixon and the Children of The Foreign Diplomats. Ferencz garnered his first professional reviews when \\"The Huckleberry Hound All-Star Review\\" had a successful three week run at New York City's Beacon Theater. In the early 1970's, Ferencz directed productions of \\"Brecht on Brecht\\" for The All Angel's Players, NYC, Woody Allen's \\"Don't Drink The Water\\" and \\"Play it Again Sam\\" for the historic Amateur Comedy Club (in Sniffen Court since 1884), as well as a series of Agatha Christie mysteries for Narrows Community Theater, which Ferencz made popular when he adapted the mysteries to take place in the Bay Ridge community of Brooklyn. It was at this time he began to study with Gene Frankel and Carl Weber at The Gene Frankel Workshop located in the Mercer Arts Center. Frankel became an early mentor to Ferencz. \\"He taught me a director's arrogance: to say no, to say I know what is best for the production,\\" he said of Frankel. At Mercer Arts, Ferencz directed a revival of Megan Terry's \\"Keep Tightly Closed in a Cool Dry Place.\\" Ferencz was one of a handful of people who survived being inside the storied building on August 3, 1973, the day the Mercer Arts collapsed. =Career= Regionally, he has worked with San Diego Rep, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Pittsburgh Public, The Cleveland Playhouse, Syracuse Stage, as well as others.

It tolerates a very wide range of substrata, predominantly rock but also tree bark, roofing tiles, glass, and in wetter areas bitumen paths and roads. Taxonomy and naming The lichen was first formally described under the name Parmelia scabrosa in 1847 by botanist Thomas Taylor. The type was collected by botanist James Drummond near Swan River in Western Australia. It became known as a species of Xanthoparmelia in 1974 when Mason Hale promoted that subgenus of Parmelia to generic status. The lichen was dubbed 'sexy footpath lichen' in a talk for the Auckland Botanical Society by Allison Knight. The name was popularised by Peter de Lange as 'sexy pavement lichen'. Description Xanthoparmelia scabrosa has a thallus that is foliose (leafy in appearance). The upper surface is yellow-green, while the lower surface is pale to dark brown. Habitat and range Xanthoparmelia scabrosa is common in Australia and New Zealand, also occurring on Norfolk Island, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Argentina, South Africa and Japan. In New Zealand it grows abundantly on roads and footpaths, ordinarily an inhospitable environment for lichens. Chemistry Xanthoparmelia scabrosa appears to tolerate the high levels of heavy metals present in asphalt by accumulating these in the thallus. It can also accumulate high levels of calcium. These abilities may make it useful for phytoremediation. Medical use Xanthoparmelia scabrosa has been marketed as a treatment for erectile dysfunction, but many scientists do not recommend this use. While the lichen contains a PDE5 inhibitor, which may inhibit an enzyme responsible for impotence, the same substance may itself be toxic. The lichen is also high in toxic heavy metals.

While at the game, he wrote his idea on a 9x12 envelope from his briefcase with sketches of the field and notes on gameplay. He presented the idea to a few friends at the NFL offices, where he received praise and encouragement for his concept. After solidifying the rules and business plan, supplemented with sketches by a professional artist, Foster presented his idea to various television networks; he reached an agreement with NBC for a \\"test game\\". Historical breakdown =1980s= ESPN was the original broadcaster for Arena Football games, showing games live in the league's first two seasons, 1987 and 1988. ESPN signed a six-year contract with the AFL in 1987, but was given the option to opt out of the contract if they were not getting the rating they wanted. The Prime Network, the forerunner to the Fox Sports Networks (officially starting on November 1, 1996, when the Prime Network names were dropped for the FSN name nationwide) broadcast the ArenaBowl from 1989-1991\\\\. Dave Enet and Bill Land served as play-by-play men and Howard Balzer and Tony Hill served as color commentators. Jim Grabowski served as a sideline reporter for ArenaBowl IV in 1990. =1990s= Partially because of turmoil within the league itself, ESPN did not broadcast Arena Football again until 1992, when they broadcast six games and the ArenaBowl on an overnight, tape delay basis. Starting in 1993, ESPN started showing games live or at least not during overnight hours. When ESPN2 was formed, the telecasts began to air more frequently on the new network. ESPN2 began televising a more standard schedule of Arena Football League regular season and playoff games from 1995–1999. It originally had aired the inaugural ArenaBowl live in 1987, while ABC (under the Wide World of Sports umbrella) aired the ArenaBowl five consecutive years from 1998-02\\\\. =2000s= The year 2000 brought a heightened interest in the AFL after Kurt Warner, who spent three years as quarterback of the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers, rose to fame as starting quarterback for The Greatest Show on Turf, the Super Bowl-winning offense of the then-St. Louis Rams. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with TNN, who would televise regular season games live on Sunday afternoons. The TNN deal coincided with the league's emergence as one with a major presence on the North American continent. Major markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Los Angeles, each of which had lacked franchises for many years, returned to the league, it received its first and only franchise in Canada (the Toronto Phantoms), and teams in smaller markets such as Albany and Iowa were relocated. In 2001, the league peaked at 19 teams. Included in the deal for the league was the right to broadcast the ArenaCup, the championship for the newly established arenafootball2, conceived as a minor league for metropolitan areas too small to support arena football as a major sport. ArenaCups I and II were carried on TNN. ESPN subsequently began televising AFL playoff games from 2000-02. TNN's coverage of the AFL also ended after the 2002 season. TNN itself was moving away from live sports, at the time transitioning to a network named Spike TV. The Chicago Rush originally had games broadcast on the now defunct Fox Sports Net Chicago during its first two seasons from 2001–02 with mostly Saturday night telecasts. When the AFL signed with NBC from 2003–06, the Rush was one of the most prominently featured teams during the national NBC broadcasts as well as playoff games and the majority of Chicago's games moved to Sunday afternoons. A few of the games not picked up by NBC remained on FSN Chicago until 2006. Beginning in the 2007 season, the AFL began a TV partnership with ESPN and FSN Chicago went under and Comcast SportsNet Chicago took its place. Once again the Rush were widely featured during the national ESPN telecasts on Monday nights and Sunday afternoons.http://www.arenafan.com The regional Chicago telecasts went to Comcast SportsNet. From 2001 to 2008, the Rush games were broadcast by Tom Dore and former Chicago Bears offensive lineman James \\"Big Cat\\" Williams. The radio deals bounced between 670 The Score and ESPN Radio 1000. The AFL comes to NBC In 2003, NBC obtained the broadcast rights (on a revenue sharing basis) and a minority interest in the Arena Football League. In conjunction with this, the league moved the beginning of the season from May to February (the week after the NFL's Super Bowl) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday afternoons instead of Friday or Saturday evenings as it had in the past. These moves were directly marketed to those seeking more football after the Super Bowl ended; advertisements for NBC's arena football coverage dubbed this phenomenon \\"post-Super Bowl stress disorder, or pissed\\" (thus openly using one of the seven dirty words). The network televised weekly games on a regional basis, as well as the entire playoff slate. The deal lasted four years, after which the league and NBC parted ways. NBC's coverage received sharp criticism from some longtime AFL fans and owners such as Jon Bon Jovi. The complaints were mostly because the network had severely cut back from their initial promotion of the AFL in 2003 and 2004, to barely promoting it at all in 2005 and 2006. NBC also tended to massively advertise select teams such as the Philadelphia Soul, Chicago Rush, Colorado Crush and the Dallas Desperados, while smaller-market teams such as the Austin Wranglers, San Jose Sabercats, Grand Rapids Rampage and the then-Columbus Destroyers were massively underpromoted or not broadcast at all. FSN would carry more than 100 telecasts in 2004, including eight games on Fox–owned Sunshine Network (now Sun Sports), with 15 of the 17 teams appearing a minimum of five times. All 17 teams would have at least two games televised through this agreement. In addition, FSN would continue producing and televising AFL WEEKLY, a weekly magazine program that premiered on the network in the previous season. The Fox Sports Networks agreement had some of the revenue-sharing aspects in common with the two-year deal that the AFL had with NBC. FSN, like NBC, didn't pay rights fees to carry the games. The network instead, split ad revenue with the AFL; NBC split ad revenue 50-50 with the league, and the Fox deal was similar but apparently not 50-50. The agreement calls for FSN to produce the game telecasts, and both the AFL and FSN will work together to sell advertising inventory. Once FSN reimbursed for its production costs, the two organizations would share ad revenue. The agreement, combined with individual team broadcasting agreements, increased the number of AFL non-NBC games on television from 39 in 2004 to more than 120 in 2005. Most FSN regional telecasts took place on Fridays and Saturdays, and were in addition to the AFL's exclusive Sunday afternoon national window on NBC. For the 2006 season, the AFL struck a cable agreement with OLN (now NBC Sports Network) to broadcast 11 weekly regular-season games and one Wild Card playoff game. However, the agreement was not renewed and was later picked up by ESPN, which also acquired a minority ownership stake in the league. In 2006, due to the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and the Daytona 500, NBC reduced its coverage of AFL games from weekly broadcast to scattered coverage during the regular season, albeit with an extensive playoff schedule ending with ArenaBowl XX. For that season, some games were moved to OLN, now known as NBC Sports Network (eleven regular-season games and one playoff game). NBC's broadcast of ArenaBowl XX in 2006 earned NBC a considerably disappointing 0.7% of the U.S. households; the small audience for the 2006 ArenaBowl was the culmination of a season that earned NBC 0.9% of the U.S. households. This was down from the inaugural 2003 season of The AFL on NBC, which earned a 1.1% share; in contrast, even at its lowest, the XFL, which aired in 2001, was drawing 1.6% of U.S. households for its NBC broadcasts. On June 30, 2006, the Arena Football League and NBC Sports failed to reach an agreement to extend their broadcasting contract, ending the network's association with the AFL after four years. League commissioner David Baker said regarding the end of the partnership, \\"NBC has been a great partner. We are forever grateful to them for exhibiting our game with the utmost respect and integrity. We wish them well, but are also excited to begin a new chapter that will continue our unprecedented growth.\\" NBC Sports president Ken Schanzer responded, \\"Unfortunately we were unable to reach an agreement. We've enjoyed our partnership with the Arena Football League. It's a great game with great people. We wish them all the best.\\" In an interview with The New York Times, NBC spokesman Mike McCarley stated, \\"we gave Arena Football our best effort, with top production and significant promotion, but the ratings never grew.\\" During an August 2006 segment of Larry King's interview with owner Jon Bon Jovi, a new deal was hinted at being in development, one that would be superior to its previous agreement with NBC. In December 2006, a deal was struck with ABC/ESPN to broadcast AFL regular season and playoff games. ESPN also assumed partial ownership of the league itself. Las Vegas Gladiators owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a renewed deal with NBC failed was because ESPN refused to show highlights of the games or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC. The end of the AFL's deal with NBC As previously mentioned, on December 19, 2006, ESPN and the Arena Football League agreed to a five-year agreement that includes extensive multimedia rights and a minimum of 26 televised games per season, beginning in 2007 and lasting until 2011. As part of the deal, ESPN purchased a minority stake, reportedly ten percent, in the AFL. The network will gain privileged financial information, but insists that it will not give the AFL more favorable coverage on shows like SportsCenter as a result.ESPN Buys Stake in the Arena Football League - 19 December 2006 11:35:00 AM - Broadcasting & Cable ESPN televised a minimum of 17 regular-season games and nine playoff games—including a minimum of three Wild Card games, three Divisional Playoff games, both Conference Championships and the ArenaBowl on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC. ESPN had an exclusive window for weekly Monday night prime time games on ESPN2. Both the season opener and ArenaBowl were on ABC, where three wild card games, two divisional games and one conference championship were on ESPN and the seventeen regular season Monday night games, one wild card game, two divisional games and one conference championship game was all on ESPN2. Some AFL fans complained that the TV schedule “inequitably favored teams” such as the Philadelphia Soul, Chicago Rush, and Colorado Crush, teams whose ownerships include, respectively, Jon Bon Jovi, Mike Ditka and John Elway. 14 of the 17 ESPN games had at least Chicago, Philadelphia or Colorado playing. The Soul (whose part-owner and team president is former AFL on ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski) have appeared in seven of the 17 regular season games on ESPN platforms, more than any other team in the league.CableFAX This criticism was also present when NBC went out of their way to not let some teams appear on their schedule. In 2008, the Chicago Rush have nine regular season games on ESPN and ABC, while the 2007 Arena Bowl Champion San Jose SaberCats have just one, week one against the Chicago Rush, and the New York Dragons had 1, a 10:30 game versus the Colorado Crush. Other criticism includes the scheduling of games on various days and times, as opposed to a weekly AFL gameday. =2010s= In 2009, the Arena Football League suspended operations to refinance and restructure its business plan. After a one-year layoff, the AFL and Chicago Rush returned in 2010 with a single entity model. On December 10, 2009, it was announced that the Rush will be returning for 2010 under new ownership as a member of Arena Football 1. The ownership obtained the rights to the name after a court auction granted the AF1 control of the AFL's assets. Two months later, the AF1 decided to adopt the former Arena Football League name. When the Rush returned in 2010, the AFL signed its TV deal with NFL Network, but the Rush were not featured as often as they had been with ESPN and NBC, averaging between 2 and 3 telecasts a year on NFL Network in 2010 and 2011, but were shutout from the national spotlight in 2012. Occasionally region games air on CSN and WGN's CLTV, and all AFL games are streamed for free online through UStream.http://arenarush.com Chicago returned to the field on April 2, 2010 on the road against the Iowa Barnstormers. The game was broadcast on the NFL Network and Chicago won 61–43. The Rush began the season 4–0 and were in first place in the division at 10–4. However, the team lost its last two games, first to the 1–13 Dallas Vigilantes and then closed out the year on the road losing to the Spokane Shock. It cost the team a chance at the division title and forced the team to go on the road for the playoffs. The team ended the regular season at 10–6, and lost to the Milwaukee Iron in the playoffs. The NFL Network broadcast the regular season each Friday night and went through the playoffs, culminating with the ArenaBowl. All AFL games not on the NFL Network could be seen for free online, provided by Ustream.NFL Network Schedule News Release NFL Network ceased airing Arena Football League games partway through the 2012 season as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league. The remaining games in the season were carried on a tape delay to prevent the possibility of the players staging a work stoppage immediately prior to a scheduled broadcast and the resulting embarrassment. Once the labor issues were resolved, the NFL Network resumed the practice of broadcasting a live Friday night game. ) before the network dropped the league outright at the end of the season. The rights were picked up by CBS Sports. The AFL aligns with CBS Sports As part of a two-year agreement, the CBS Sports Network aired nineteen regular season games and two playoff games. When CBS aired ArenaBowl XXVI, it marked the first time since 2008 that the league's finale aired on network television. Regular season CBSSN broadcast games were usually on Saturday nights. As the games were shown live, the start times were not uniform as with most football broadcast packages, but varied with the time zone in which the home team was located. This meant that the AFL may have appeared either prior to or following the CBSSN's featured Major League Lacrosse game. ESPN would be returning to the AFL (starting in 2014) as broadcast partners, with weekly games being shown on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNEWS, and all other games available live and free on ESPN3. ESPN Deportes and ESPN Latin America will start to broadcast AFL games in Spanish as of the 2016 season. For the 2017 season, one AFL game per week was broadcast live nationally over CBS Sports Network. In 2017, the AFL also began streaming some games on Twitter and AFLNow, the league's streaming service. For the 2018 season, the AFL's sole national English language telecast partner was the CBS Sports Network, but all games were streamed free online and Brigade and Valor games were available over their owner Ted Leonsis' Monumental Sports Network. As of 2019, CBS Sports no longer airs Arena Football League games.

He had just arrived in Niorth Zealand from Broager in Sønderjylland where his father Hans Heinrich Dithmer owned Rendbjerg Brickworks. He purchased Klostermose from the city in 1848 and planted Klostermose Skov. Ditmer was joined by Fritz Hansen Friedrichsen, the 16 years old son of one of his father's employees, who would later acquire Sølyst Brickworks. In 1855, Klostermosegaard introduced steam power, probably as the first brickyard in Denmark. A new main building and the first Hoffmann kiln in Denmark were constructed in 1861. Klostermosegaard Brickworks was by 1872 the third largest brickworks in Denmark. The company ran into economic difficulties in the early 1880s and was ultimately and was taken over by Den Danske Landmandsbank. The bank sold the main building and charged one of Dithmer's son with managing the brickyard until it was sold to Frederiksholm Kalk- og Teglværker in 1912. It closed on 16 January 1916.

The former president of L'Œuvre Française (2012-13), he has been the spokesman of the French Nationalist Party since 2015.  Biography  = Early life = Yvan Benedetti was born on 16 September 1965 in La Réunion, from a Corsican father. During his youth, he attended a technical high school and was a member of the Nouvelle Droite scouting organization Europe-Jeunesse. = L'Œuvre Française = In the 1990s-2000s, he was the right-hand-man of Pierre Sidos, the founder and leader of L'Œuvre Française (also known as L'Œuvre). After negotiations with Sidos, Jean-Marie Le Pen allowed some L'Œuvre militants, notably Benedetti, to integrate the FN in 2007. In 2011, he directed the electoral campaign of Bruno Gollnisch for the presidency of the FN. Benedetti was however expelled from the party in 2011 after he defined himself as an \\"anti-Zionist, anti-Semite, anti-Jews\\" in an interview. Benedetti, along with nationalist activist Alexandre Gabriac, decided to establish \\"Jeunesses Nationalistes\\" in 2011 as the youth movement and activist branch of L'Œuvre Française, in order to attract militants disappointed by the new FN leadership. The following year, Pierre Sidos, then 85, left the presidency of L'Œuvre after 44 years in office, succeeded by Benedetti. L'Œuvre Française was dissolved on 23 July 2013 after the issue of an official decree by the then Minister of the Interior, Manuel Valls. The ban occurred in a context of street violence by far-right revolutionary groups, and followed the death of a far-left activist in a fight involving another nationalist association led by Serge Ayoub. Valls justified the dissolution by denouncing L'Œuvre as a group \\"organized like a private militia thanks to paramilitary-like training camps.\\" He further added that the association had been \\"spreading a xenophobic and antisemitic ideology, diffusing racist and Holocaust-denying thesis, exalting collaboration [with the Nazis] and the Vichy regime, paying regular tribute to Pétain, Brasillach or Maurras\\". = French Nationalist Party = In 2014, Benedetti and Gabriac ran in the municipal elections of Vénissieux, in the outskirts of Lyon, inviting electors to \\"slip a quenelle\\" inside the ballot box. They obtained, with 11.5% of the votes, sieges in the city council. The ballot initiated by the two FN dissidents was called \\"Vénissieux Fait Front\\" and featured most of the candidates that had run for the FN during the previous election, which led Marine Le Pen to denounce Benedetti and Gabriac as \\"parasites\\" and to call for the invalidation of their candidacy. The vote was eventually declared void a few months later by the Conseil d'État due to irregularities in the list of candidates. In September 2015, Benedetti appealed to join the French Nationalist Party, of which he is the spokesman. The movement had been established back in 1983 and re-activated earlier in 2015 to cope with the dissolution of several far-right groups in 2013. After the death of Robert Faurisson in October 2018, he described the Holocaust denier as a \\"modern-day herald who marked the second half of the 20th century.\\"http://www.conspiracywatch.info/deces-de-faurisson-la-complosphere- antisemite-en-deuil.html In late 2018, he participated in the Yellow Vest movement; his presence was noticed by the media due to an altercation with a team of journalists. In June 2019, Yvan Benedetti was condemned to a suspended 8 months jail sentence for \\"recreating a disbanded league\\", L'Œuvre having kept on operating for several months following the dissolution. In October 2019, he bullied journalists during an anti-ART march in Paris to prevent them from interviewing demonstrators, and participated in the degradation of their equipment, including a camera.

The blood group consists of a single antigen, the high-frequency Vel antigen, which is expressed on the surface of red blood cells. Individuals are typed as Vel-positive or Vel-negative depending on the presence of this antigen. The expression of the antigen in Vel-positive individuals is highly variable and can range from strong to weak. Individuals with the rare Vel-negative blood type develop anti-Vel antibodies when exposed to Vel-positive blood, which can cause transfusion reactions on subsequent exposures. Genetics Autosomal recessive inheritance The Vel blood group is associated with the SMIM1 gene, which is located in the 1p36 region of chromosome 1. This gene produces small integral membrane protein 1, a single- pass transmembrane protein which carries the Vel antigen but whose structure and function are otherwise poorly understood. The Vel-negative phenotype is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, being expressed by patients who are homozygous for a deletion mutation in the coding region of SMIM1 which renders the gene nonfunctional. Patients who are heterozygous for this mutation, meaning inherited from only one parent, exhibit weakened Vel antigen expression. Missense mutations at nucleotide position 152 can also result in a weak Vel phenotype, and various single nucleotide polymorphisms in the noncoding regions of SMIM1 affect the strength of Vel antigen expression. Epidemiology The Vel-negative blood type is rare. The highest prevalence of Vel-negative blood has been reported in Sweden, where approximately 1 in 1200 individuals exhibit this phenotype. Only about 1 in 3000 English people and 1 in 4000 Southern Europeans are Vel-negative, and much lower rates have been reported in people of African and Asian heritage. Clinical significance donor blood, or may self-donate before elective surgery that calls for a blood transfusion. When exposed to Vel-positive blood through transfusion or pregnancy, Vel-negative individuals can become sensitized and begin producing an anti-Vel antibody. If they are exposed to Vel-positive blood again, the anti-Vel antibody can bind to Vel-positive red blood cells and destroy them, causing hemolysis. Anti-Vel is a particularly dangerous antibody because it is able to activate the complement system, which causes immediate and severe destruction of red blood cells. Therefore, patients with anti-Vel should not be transfused with Vel-positive blood, as it can cause a serious acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Finding compatible blood for Vel-negative patients is difficult due to the rarity of this blood type, and it may be necessary to perform autologous blood donation or to contact rare blood banks. Cases of anti-Vel causing hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) have been reported, but this is an unusual occurrence. It is hypothesized that anti-Vel associated HDN is rare because the antibody is usually predominantly composed of IgM immunoglobulin, which does not cross the placenta into the fetal circulation. In addition, the expression of Vel is very weak on fetal red blood cells – particularly in children who are heterozygous for Vel. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (a condition in which patients produce antibodies against antigens on their own red blood cells, leading to hemolysis) involving auto-anti-Vel has been reported. Laboratory testing An individual's Vel blood type can be determined by serologic methods, which use reagents containing anti-Vel antibodies to identify the antigen, or by genetic testing. As of 2019, serologic testing for Vel is mainly performed using polyclonal antibodies isolated from the blood of patients with anti-Vel. However, this method is problematic because these antibodies are variable in quality and sometimes produce false negative results in patients with weak Vel expression; moreover, the reagent cannot be mass produced. In 2016, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against Vel was introduced and it has since been used to screen for Vel-negative blood donors in France. Genotyping of SMIM1 using polymerase chain reaction is another method that has been used to identify Vel-negative donors. Anti-Vel is a mixture of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins and is able to activate complement, which can cause hemolysis in vitro (i.e. during compatibility testing). Anti-Vel can be mistaken for a typical cold antibody in compatibility testing if inappropriate techniques are used; this misidentification is dangerous, because such antibodies are usually clinically insignificant. History The Vel blood group was first described in 1952 by Sussman and Miller, who reported a case of a patient who had suffered a severe hemolytic reaction following a blood transfusion. The patient's serum was subsequently crossmatched against blood samples from 10,000 donors, and only five of them were found to be compatible, indicating that an antibody against a high-frequency antigen was present. This antigen was named Vel after the first patient. The authors also observed variable expression of the antigen: the patient's serum reacted less strongly with the blood of her children, who were presumably heterozygous for Vel, than with blood from unrelated donors. In 1955, a further case was described in which the blood of a woman who had suffered a transfusion reaction was incompatible with more than 1,000 donors, but not with the blood of the first Vel-negative patient. This patient's antibody was the first example of an anti-Vel that could hemolyze red blood cells in vitro. Six other individuals from three generations of this woman's family were found to be Vel-negative, but they did not exhibit an anti-Vel antibody, demonstrating that anti-Vel is not naturally occurring. By 1962, 19 cases of anti-Vel and approximately 50 cases of Vel-negative patients had been described. Although the Vel blood group has been widely studied due to its significance in transfusion medicine, its genetic and molecular basis remained unclear for several decades. In 2013, two research groups simultaneously identified the SMIM1 gene and its protein product as the determinants of the Vel blood group. The Vel blood group was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in 2016.

By far the most important was the Emancipation reform of 1861 which freed the 23 million serfs from an inferior legal and social status, and helped them buy a farm. Many other reforms took place, including the: * relaxation of censorship of the media * Judicial reform of Alexander II * modernization of the army and navy * zemstva and other innovations in local government * educational innovations including the expansion and reform of universities, elementary schools and secondary schools * reform of the Russian Orthodox Church * economic modernization impacting banking, railways, mining, manufacturing * emancipation of the peasants in Poland * improved the status of Jews. By 1865 reaction began, and some reforms were cut back. After the tsar's assassination in 1881, his successor Alexander III reversed many reforms.  Background The Russian Empire in the 19th century was characterized by very conservative and reactionary policies issued by the autocratic tsars. The great exception came during the reign of Alexander II, (1855-1881), especially the 1860s. By far the greatest and most unexpected was the abolition of serfdom, which affected 23 million of the Empire's population of 74 million. They belonged to the state, to monasteries and to 104,000 rich gentry landowners--it was the last group that was emancipated first.Wayne Vucinich, ed. The Peasant in Nineteenth-Century Russia (1968) p 41. As soon as he became tsar Alexander set up numerous commissions that studied various proposals for reforms in practically every area. Experts debated in draft of the proposals, but Alexander made all the final decisions. While the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 was the most famous and dramatic reform, a host of new reforms affected diverse areas. W. Bruce Lincoln, The great reforms: Autocracy, bureaucracy, and the politics of change in imperial Russia (Northern Illinois UP, 1990.Ben Eklof, John Bushnell, and Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, eds. Russia's great reforms, 1855-1881 (Indiana UP, 1994. The tsar appointed Dmitry Milyutin to carry out significant reforms in the Russian armed forces. Further important changes were made concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of limited liability companies. Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly to develop the natural resources of the country, and partly to increase its power for defense and attack. Donald Mackenzie Wallace, \\"Alexander II (1818–1881)\\". The Encyclopaedia Britannica (1910). 1:pp. 559–61 A new judicial administration (1864), based on the French model, introduced security of tenure.An Introduction to Russian History (1976), edited by Robert Auty and Dimitri Obolensky, chapter by John Keep, p. 238 A new penal code and a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure also came into operation. Wallace, \\"Alexander II\\" (1910) pp. 559–61. Reorganisation of the judiciary occurred to include trial in open court, with judges appointed for life, a jury system and the creation of justices of the peace to deal with minor offences at local level. Legal historian Sir Henry Maine credited Alexander II with the first great attempt since the time of Grotius to codify and humanise the usages of war.  Role of Tsar Alexander II Alexander II When Alexander II ascended the throne in 1855, the largely peasant conscripted army in the Crimean war was a national disgrace, and clearly demonstrated that despite its large size, Russian was no longer competitive to smaller industrial powers such as Britain and France. The demand for reform was widespread, but unorganized. There been little consideration of how the complex economic social political and legal roles of the service would be ended. The tsar decided to abolish serfdom from above, setting up a new system whereby the state would be able to purchase farmland from the landowners and sell it to the freed serfs. The Tsar told Moscow nobles: “Better that the reform should come from above than wait until serfdom is abolished from below.” Historians have debated Alexander's role. Soviet era historians downplayed him, as they beieved social forces caused history not individuals. Non-Marxist critics say he did not go far enough, especially since he rejected any parliament or duma. His top advisors included Count Michael von Reutern, Finance Minister, 1862-1878, and the brothers Nikolay Milyutin (1818-1872).W. Bruce Lincoln, Nikolai Miliutin, an enlightened Russian Bureaucrat (1977). and Field Marshall Dmitry Milyutin. Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin (1861–81) was responsible for sweeping military reforms. He was also instrumental in creating the framework for the Circassian genocide that led to the deaths of large numbers of Circassian refugees from 1861 to 1865.Forrest A. Miller, Dmitrii Miliutin and the Reform Era in Russia (1968)Walter Richmond, The Circassian Genocide (Rutgers UP, 2013), pp 70-71, 131-34.online Boris Chicherin (1828-1904) was a political philosopher who believed that Russia needed a strong, authoritative government by Alexander to make possible all the important reforms that did take place. He praised Alexander for the range of his fundamental reforms, arguing that the tsar was: :called upon to execute one of the hardest tasks which can confront an autocratic ruler: to completely remodel the enormous state which had been entrusted to his care, to abolish an age-old order founded on slavery, to replace it with civic decency and freedom, to establish justice in a country which it never known the meaning of legality, to redesign the entire administration, to introduce freedom of the press in the context of untrammeled authority, to call new forces to life at every turn and set them on firm legal foundations, to put a repressed and humiliated society on its feet and to give at the chance to flex its muscles. Quoted in David Saunders, ‘’Russia in the age of reaction and reform: 1801–1881’’ (1992) p. 213  Censorship and glasnost In 1858 he removed most of the censorship restrictions on the media--newspapers, magazines, books and pamphlets, resulting in an explosion of new publications. Thus Alexander achieved a degree of \\"glasnost\\" or open discussion, as the new media were often filled with discussions of reforms that were urgently needed.Seton- Watson, The Russian Empire 1801-1917 p 358.W. Bruce Lincoln, \\"The Problem of Glasnost'in Mid-Nineteenth Century Russian Politics.\\" European Studies Review 11.2 (1981): 171-188.  Serfdom A 1907 painting by Boris Kustodiev depicting Russian serfs listening to the proclamation of the Emancipation Manifesto in 1861 =Emancipation of the serfs 1861= The emancipation reform of 1861 that freed 23 million serfs was the single most important event in 19th-century Russian history, and the beginning of the end for the landed aristocracy's monopoly of power.Rieber ed. The politics of autocracy p 15. The decree ended the feudal obligations owed by serfs and allotted them land. The owners received Treasury bonds, which amounted to liquid capital. The peasants who stayed on the land were obliged to make redemption payments to their obshchina (the village mir, or commune) over a 49-year period. David Moon, The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia: 1762-1907 (2001) pp 70-83. Besides liberating the serfs from tight control by the gentry, emancipation brought a supply of free labour to the cities--including both peasants and gentry. This stimulated industry by providing a working class and allowed the middle class grew in number and influence. All the land and property turned over to the peasants was owned collectively by the mir, the village community, which divided the land among the peasants and supervised the various holdings. Revolutionaries were not satisfied. They believed that the newly freed serfs were merely being sold into wage slavery by the bourgeoisie. Revolutionaries calling themselves Narodnaya Volya (the People's Will) made multiple attempts to assassinate Alexander II, and they succeeded in 1881. =Role of gentry= While most of the landowning gentry were conservative, the strong liberal element that was more articulate. They vigorously argued that serfdom was severely restricting the entrepreneurial opportunities of the gentry. They propose that emancipation of the serfs, financed by the government, would provide the gentry and the nobles with capital to invest in the sort of economic opportunities that were being demonstrated in Western Europe. These innovative schemes came especially from the liberal gentry in Tver province. The plan was to use government loan so that freed serfs could purchase farms from the gentry. The gentry would then have the capital to begin entirely new enterprises not restricted by the low returns to farming in the cold Russian climate. In late 1858 Alexander II set up a commission to study emancipation and the liberal ideas proved attractive. However the government bureaucrats shut out the liberals from The actual planning, much to their dismay. A compromise was reached whereby the gentry was given extensive new roles in zemstvos created to operate local government.Terrence Emmons, The Russian Landed Gentry and the Peasant Emancipation of 1861 (1968). =State serfs= The national government also owned serfs, called state serfs until they too were emancipated in November 1866. The tsar promulgated a law \\"On the Land Device State Peasants\\", allowing the rural society to maintain land in their possession with the rights of \\"ownership\\". Redemption from the government of the property holdings was regulated by the law of 12 June 1886. After the implementation of these reforms, plots of state peasants were reduced by 10% in the central provinces and 44% – in the northern. Payments were calculated for 49½ years, and in some cases had to be made before 1931, but were canceled on 1 January 1907 as part of the Stolypin agrarian reform under the influence of the revolution in 1905.Roger Bartlett, \\"Serfdom and state power in imperial Russia.\\" European History Quarterly 33.1 (2003): 29-64.  Judiciary The judicial reforms were among the most successful and consistent of all his reforms.Ben Eklof, , John Bushnell, and Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, eds. Russia's great reforms, 1855-1881 (Indiana UP, 1994) pp 214-46. A completely new court system and order of legal proceedings were established. The main results were the introduction of a unified judicial system instead of a cumbersome set of estates of the realm courts, and fundamental changes in criminal trials. The latter included the establishment of the principle of equality of the parties involved, the introduction of public hearings, the jury trial, and a professional advocate that had never existed in Russia. However, there were also problems, as certain obsolete institutions were not covered by the reform. Also, the reform was hindered by extrajudicial punishment, introduced on a widespread scale during the reigns of his successors – Alexander III and Nicholas II.Richard Wortman, \\"Russian monarchy and the rule of law: New considerations of the court reform of 1864.\\" Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 6.1 (2005): 145-170. The judicial reforms started on 20 November 1864, when the tsar signed the decree which enforced four Regulations (Establishment of Judicial Settlements, Regulations of Civil Proceedings, Regulations of Criminal Proceedings, and Regulations of Punishments Imposed by Justices of the Peace). One of the most important results of the reform was wide introduction of jury trials. The jury trial included three professional judges and twelve jurors. A juror had to possess real estate of a certain value. Unlike in modern jury trials, jurors not only could decide whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty but also could decide that the defendant was guilty but not to be punished, as Alexander II believed that justice without morality is wrong. The sentence was rendered by professional judges.Samuel Kucherov, \\"The Jury as Part of the Russian Judicial Reform of 1864.\\" American Slavic and East European Review 9.2 (1950): 77-90.  Military Dmitry Milyutin as war minister, focused on rebuilding a very large, very poor army into one that could compete with modern western armies, as well as deal with ethnic groups on the fringes of the empire. W. Bruce Lincoln, \\"General Dmitrii Milyutin and the Russian Army,\\" History Today (1976) 26#1 pp 40-47.W. Bruce Lincoln, The Great Reforms pp 143-160. In the old system conscription was compulsorily enforced only for the peasantry. It was for 25 years for serfs, and they were selected by the landowners. The result was An infantry filled primarily with poorly qualified, poorly motivated and incompetent soldiers.Jonathon Bromley, \\"Russia 1848–1917\\" The new reforms included universal conscription, introduced for all social classes starting in 1874. Other military reforms included extending the reserve forces and the military district system, which split the Russian states into 15 military districts. Railway planning emphasized strategic Strategic lines connecting population centers to likely battlefields. Military education was dramatically improved for the officer corps. Corporal punishment in the military and branding of soldiers as punishment were banned.Edvard Radzinsky, Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar, pp. 150–51. Forrest A. Miller, Dmitrii Miliutin and the Reform Era in Russia (1968) The first great task of the reconstituted army was defeating the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan wars of 1877. The first result was a disaster and humiliation, calming showing failures at every level from poorly trained companies, to outmoded tactics to dilatory maneuvers, to failures of overall strategy at the top command level.John S. Bushnell, \\"Miliutin and the Balkan War: military reform vs. military performance,\\" in Ben Eklof et al., \\"Russia's rate reformers, 1855-1881 (1994) pp 139-158.E. Willis Brooks, \\"Reform in the Russian Army, 1856-1861\\" Slavic Review 43#1 (1984), pp. 63-82 Online Naval reforms were also attempted, To build a modern steel fleet inexperienced private Russian shipyards were used. The Russians tried to save money by inventing their own technology rather than purchasing the latest models from Western Europe. Alexander II made the mistake of putting his brother in charge of the Navy, and then playing his ministers against each other to save money. Consequently naval programs were poorly coordinated with other ministries. In any case most of the budget went to the Army and Russia was never able to catch up with even the second-tier European naval powers.Jacob W. Kipp,, \\"The Russian Navy and the Problem of Technological Transfer,\\" in Ben Eklof et al., \\"Russia's rate reformers, 1855-1881 (1994) pp 115-138. The fleet's first great test was against Japan at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, with Russia having a slightly larger force. In a matter of hours, the entire Russian Navy was sunk or surrendered, with only four small ships escaping.Mark Lardas, Tsushima 1905: Death of a Russian Fleet (Osprey, 2018) online.  Local government Alexander's bureaucracy instituted an elaborate scheme of local self-government (zemstvo) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of taxation, and a new rural and municipal police under the direction of the Minister of the Interior. All owners of houses, tax-paying merchants and workmen are enrolled on lists in a descending order according to their assessed wealth. The total valuation is then divided into three equal parts, representing three groups of electors very unequal in number, each of which elects an equal number of delegates to the municipal duma. The executive is in the hands of an elective mayor and an uprava, which consists of several members elected by the duma. The gentry played the leading role in most localities, and indeed the new system was designed for them.Terence Emmons and Wayne S. Vucinich, eds. The Zemstvo in Russia: An Experiment in Local Self-Government (Cambridge UP, 1982).  Education Before 1860 Russia had a scattershot educational program that featured a few good universities, but severe limitations in every other area. Planning began in 1858, and the main reforms came in 1863. They extended popular education, opened secondary schools to women and allowed some women to audit University courses. Universities obtained more autonomy, but when small-scale student protests erupted, universities were returned to closer supervision. Private groups opened over 500 Sunday schools, without government funding or supervision, but the government distrusted innovations--such as teaching history--in place of wrote language drills and closed them down .Saunders, Russia in the Age of Reaction and Reform 1801-1881 (1992) pp 250-52, 257-58. Although new funding was not made available, laws in 1864 reformed secondary schools along the lines typical in France and Prussia. Elementary schools Likewise were regulated to emphasize religious teaching by Orthodox priests.Seton-Watson, The Russian Empire 1801-1917 (1967) pp 357-61.  Economy Count Michael von Reutern, Finance Minister, 1862-1878 The extreme difficulties of financing the Crimean war, and the military weakness caused by an ineffective railway system made economic reforms a high priority. A state bank was founded in 1860, and municipal banks in 1862, as well as savings banks in 1869, All under national supervision. A systematic overhaul of national finances was achieved in 1862 by legislation that created a ministry of finance under Count Michael von Reutern (1862-1878),along with a regular national budget supervised by the finance minister. Reutern installed a uniform system of public accounting for government agencies. Tax collection was no longer handled by private farmers, but became a regular national bureaucratic issue. There was no income taxes yet, In the poll tax was continued, but the much hated salt tax was abolished. He promoted private credit institutions and stabilised the rouble. Government revenues rose significantly, the chronic budget deficit was eliminated by 1867 and surpluses were achieved from 1873. On trade policy Reutern pragmatically supported reducing some tariffs and duties on manufacturing goods in 1863 and 1868. A balanced budget facilitated borrowing from Western Europe, using state guaranteed railway bonds. This made possible the rapid expansion of the rail system. The Russian-Turkish war ran up deficits and he resigned in 1878.

In 1860 there were 78 joint stock companies, with a capital of less than 8 million roubles each.Between 1861 in 1873, businessmen set up 357 joint stock companies with a capital of 1.1 billion roubles. They included 73 banks, 53 railways and 163 factories. Foreign capital started arriving for the first time, although massive amounts had to wait for the alliance with France in the 1890s.Seton-Watson, The Russian Empire 1801-1917 (1967) pp 408-409.  Poland Under Alexander II Polish nobles demanded greater autonomy. This demand was rejected by the tsar's council. Instead There were new restrictions on internal mobility inside Poland, including requiring passports. In response to unrest the tsar Appointed a moderate Aleksander Wielopolski as chief minister in 1862. Wielopolski was conservative, pro-Russian, a proponent of regaining Poland's pre-1830 autonomy, and a champion of the emancipation of Jews. He adopted a series of liberal reforms in education, for Jews and peasants. He undertook educational reforms, increasing the number of Polish-language schools and establishing in Warsaw the \\"Main School\\" (Szkola Glowna, today's University of Warsaw). He also enacted banking-system reforms and agricultural reform (rents instead of serfdom for peasants).Jonathan Bromley, Russia 1848–1917 (2002) pp 41-43.Stanley J.

Online  Finland The diet or Parliament of Finland had not met in 55 years, but in 1863 Alexander called it into session. It passed a language law that would make Finnish equal with Swedish in all public business. Mass protests erupted across Finland in 1898 when Tsar Nicholas II reversed the policy and made Russian the official language. Jonathan Bromley, Russia 1848–1917 (2002) pp 43-44, 63-64.David Kirby, A Concise History of Finland (2006) pp 105-49.  Jews Under Alexander's rules Jews could not hire Christian servants, could not own land, and were restricted in travel. However special taxes on Jews were eliminated and those who graduated from secondary school were permitted to live outside the Pale of Settlement, and became eligible for state employment. Large numbers of educated Jews moved as soon as possible to Moscow and other major cities. Jews were blamed for the assassination of Alexander II. The backlash was fierce and conditions grew much worse.James P. Duffy, Vincent L. Ricci, Czars: Russia's Rulers for Over One Thousand Years, p. 324 Alaska The Alaska colony was losing money, and would be impossible to defend in wartime against Britain, so in 1867 Russia sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million (equivalent to roughly $200 million in current dollars), The Russian administrators, soldiers, settlers, and some of the priests returned home. Others stayed to minister to their native parishioners, who remain members of the Russian Orthodox Church into the 21st century.James R. Gibson, \\"Why the Russians Sold Alaska.\\" Wilson Quarterly 3.3 (1979): 179-188. Online  Rejection of a parliament Alexander firmly believed he had the God-given duty to rule as an autocrat, and that he alone understood the best interests of all of the people of Russia. Therefore he rejected any idea of a constitution that would limit his authority, and rejected any parliament or Duma that would take over some of the responsibilities that he alone could perform. Seton-Watson, The Russian Empire 1801–1917, p 333.  Ending the reform era and a return to conservatism The first decade of the rule of Alexander II strongly promoted reforms in many areas. In sharp contrast, the remainder of his term after 1865 saw the growing strength of conservatives and reactionaries who reversed or limited many of the reforms. The grew strength from the increasingly violent actions of the Revolutionary underground. Saunders, Russia in the Age of Reaction and Reform 1801-1881 (1992) pp xi-xii, 263-72. Historian Orlando Figes has argued: : Had the liberal spirit of the 1860s continued to pervade the work of government, Russia might have become a Western-style society based upon individual property and liberty upheld by the rule of law. The revolution need not occurred....There was at least, within the ruling elite, a growing awareness of what was needed....The problem was, however, that the elite was increasingly divided over the desirability of this transformation. And as a result of these divisions it failed to develop a coherent strategy to deal with the challenges of modernization. Orlando Figes, ‘’A People’s Tragedy: A history of the Russian Revolution’’ (1996) p. 40.  Memory and historiography According to Russian scholar Larisa Zakharova: :The abolition of serfdom in 1861, under Alexander II, and the reforms which followed (local government reforms, the judicial reform, the abolition of corporal punishment, the reform of the military, public education, censorship and others), were a ‘watershed’, ‘a turning point’ in the history of Russia. This is the verdict of the reformers themselves and their opponents, people wh lived at the time in Russia as well as beyond its borders, and many researchers. This theme remains crucial for historians. But in particular periods such as during the 1905 Revolution or Gorbachev’s perestroika, interest in the history of Alexander II’s reforms has acquired a particular topicality and political colouring.Larisa Zakharova, \\"The reign of Alexander II: a watershed?\\" in Dominic Lieven, ed., The Cambridge History of Russia Volume 2: Imperial Russia, 1689-1917 (2006) pp. 593-616 quoting p. 593. In Russia, the bulk of serious commentary on the emancipation of the serfs was highly favorable before 1917, With Alexander playing a central role. Soviet historians minimized Alexander and the other personalities , arguing that the crisis in feudalism forced the rulers to compromise. The key Leninist interpretation was that the concessions were merely a tactical response to a concerted attack on the status quo by rural masses and their urban allies. Western historians have generally agreed that fear of further upheaval played a minor role in the decision.N. G. O.

A photographer, graphic artist and author, Kagan is remembered for the rock concert posters featuring his photographs published during San Francisco’s psychedelic Sixties and the book of photographs depicting Utopian communities he published in 1975. Kagan was born in Chicago in 1943, but his family moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. As a teenager, he was active in political protests; by the time he began college at the University of California at Berkeley, he was listed by the House Un-American Activities Committees as one of the country’s most dangerous radicals. He graduated in 1965 with a degree in history. It was at UC Berkeley that he learned photography, and following graduation he pursued a career as a commercial photographer, magazine art director and television news writer as well as a fine-art photographer. In the late 1960s he photographed the Monterey Pop Festival, the Human Be-In of 1967, and the People’s Park protests of 1969.  Photography  Kagan exhibited his photographs at Stanford University in 1966 and the University of California Extension campus in San Francisco in 1973. He was in a group show at the Light Sound Dimension Gallery in one of the several Rolling Renaissance exhibitions in San Francisco in 1968. In the late 1960s Kagan shot a series of erotic photographs that were used by designers in rock concert posters. Designers who used his photos included Victor Moscoso and David Smith. These images became some of his most widely known work. Kagan also designed some posters of his own, including some of his photographs, for 1968 Avalon Ballroom concerts. He worked with Family Dog, a production company in San Francisco run by Chet Helms, which organized concerts. In 1966 Kagan photographed Country Joe and the Fish, and the images were used on four covers for albums released in 1967. Kagan’s photographs appeared in “Rolling Stone” magazine, the “Berkeley Barb” and “Berkeley Tribe” weekly newspapers and on the cover of Ramparts magazine. They also appeared in the Night Times. Kagan's photographs were the subject of a retrospective exhibition in 2014 at the World Erotic Art Museum in Miami.  New World Utopias  Around 1970 Kagan began to research and photograph California Utopian communities. This work was supported first by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health and then by the California Historical Society. Following five years of research, in 1975 Kagan published a book titled “New World Utopias: A Photographic History of the Search for Community.” The book profiles ten Utopian communities in California, dating from 1870 to 1970, and includes photographs Kagan took when he visited sites of current and former communities. An exhibition of these photographs was mounted at the Oakland Museum in 1975. By the late 1970s he was working as a photographer with a San Francisco advertising agency, Dailey & Associates, where he won trade group awards for several advertisements featuring his photographs. Kagan died in New York City in 1993. References  External Links  * Paul Kagan Photographs of Utopian Communities and Personal Papers.

He became a protégé of Wan Li and rose to the position of Vice Mayor and Executive Vice Mayor of Beijing, serving from 1983 to 1995. Zhang was in charge of major construction projects in Beijing, including those in preparation for the 1990 Asian Games, and led the city's unsuccessful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics.  Early life and career in construction  Zhang was born in 1935 in Xianghe County, Hebei, Republic of China. In 1948, he moved with his father, a weaver, to Beijing. Owing to poverty, he was unable to attend school and worked as his father's assistant. With the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Beijing regained its status as the capital of China, and the new Communist government initiated a large number of construction projects. In 1951, Zhang became an apprentice rebar worker at the age of 16. He and his friend, carpenter Li Ruihuan, worked together in the construction of the Great Hall of the People and solved a number of technical issues. After work, he took adult education courses at night, and eventually earned a correspondence education degree from the Renmin University of China. Zhang was named a \\"model worker\\" of Beijing in 1954, and joined the Communist Party of China in the same year. He was elected a delegate to the 4th National People's Congress, and the Beijing leader Deng Tuo called him a \\"people's hero\\". From 1958 to 1966, when Wan Li served as Vice Mayor of Beijing in charge of construction, Li Ruihuan and Zhang Baifa were his key assistants and described in Chinese media as the \\"Heng and Ha Generals\\" of Wan. However, Wan was purged when the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, and Zhang was also persecuted as his protégé.  Vice Mayor of Beijing  After the end of Cultural Revolution, Zhang was rehabilitated and appointed Vice Mayor of Beijing in 1983. He later served as Executive Vice Mayor until his retirement in 1998. During his tenure, he was in charge of major construction projects in Beijing, such as those in preparation for the 1990 Asian Games. Zhang led Beijing's unsuccessful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. In July 1993, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the International Olympic Committee to reject Beijing's bid because of China's human rights abuses. In reaction, Zhang told Australia's Special Broadcasting Service that China might boycott the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games as revenge. In his interview with the television station, he praised American people but called the US Congress \\"stupid\\". He Zhenliang, head of the Chinese Olympic Committee, denied that Zhang's remarks represented official Chinese policy. Because of his humble background and approachable personality, Zhang was praised in Chinese media as a \\"people's mayor\\". However, scientist Fang Lizhi openly criticized him in 1985 for travelling to the United States as a member of an official scientific delegation for high energy physics.  Later life and death  Zhang and his wife Wang Shulan () had a son and a daughter. By coincidence, his wife shared the same name and birthdate as the wife of his friend and colleague Li Ruihuan, who rose to the Politburo Standing Committee. Zhang died in Beijing on 5 July 2019, at the age of 84.

At the end of the Edo period, Sagara Castle had been degraded to a jin'ya and was home to the Tanuma clan, daimyō of Sagara Domain. Background Sagara Castle is located near the present-day Makinohara city hall and is situated on a plateau between the Ōi River and Cape Omaezaki within the former province of Tōtōmi. Although located some distance south of the route of the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto, the area prospered because of its port and due to sat production. The castle was first built by the local Sagara clan during the late Heian period beside a curve of the Hagima River. During the Sengoku period, after Takeda Katsuyori captured Takatenjin Castle in 1575, he also seized this fortification and rebuilt it as a strategic point to control the logistics chain between Takatenjin and his holdings in Suruga Province. After the fall of the Takeda clan, the castle came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who built a residence on its grounds in 1584 for use as a resting place while he visited the area for falconry hunting. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the area around Sagara was initially tenryō territory administered directly by the shogunate. However, in 1710 a cadet branch of the Honda clan was awarded a small domain and moved his seat to Sagara. As his kokudaka was small, he was not allowed the honor of a castle, and the fortification became a jin'ya  History  In 1767, Sagara was awarded to Tanuma Okitsugu, rōjū to Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune, Tokugawa Ieharu and Tokugawa Ieshige. He is known for the Tenmei economic reforms. At the time, the shogunate was in a dire economic situation with the development of a monetary economy outstripping the traditional rice-based stipend system for the samurai class, which caused ever increasing debt. The government applied fiscal restraint by reducing the budget, increasing tax and suppression of commerce, but this also bought deflation. Tanuma used the opposite approach, encouraged commerce and protected merchants through guilds in exchange of taxes. He also adopted positive fiscal policy such as increase of monetary base, and made large scale public works projects.These policy intended to increase tax revenue by developing of economy. Due to the initial successes of his reforms, and his close relations with the shogun, he was promoted from a relatively low status to daimyō and was allowed to construct an actual castle on the site of the Sagara jin'ya. The castle took 12 years to complete, and was on a large scale with am inner bailey, second and third bailey, and an outer enclosure, all surrounded by moats and stone walls. The total dimensions of the castle were approximately 500 meter by 400 meters. Also of note was that Tanuma constructed a three-story donjon, which was very rare for the mid-Edo period. He also developed the town surrounding the castle as a jōkamachi and encouraged the development of commerce. However, this period of prosperity did not last. Tanuma made many enemies in his rise from relative obscurity, and conservative strongly disapproved of his commerce-based reforms. His administration was accused of massive corruption. The Great Tenmei famine and a eruption of Mount Asama caused further disruption, and increasing inflation caused riots in Edo. With the death of Shogun Tokugawa Ieharu, Tanuma fell from favor and was demoted to Shimomura Domain in Mutsu Province. Sagara reverted to tenryō status, and Sagara Castle was destroyed after only 10 years of its completion. In 1823, Tanuma Okitsugu's son was allowed to return to Sagara, but with a kokudaka of only 10,000 koku. He was allowed only a jin'ya, which he built on the ruins of the former castle, and from which the Tanuma clan ruled until the Meiji restoration. All that remains of the fortifications today are some partial stone walls. However, the daimyō palace survived and was relocated to a temple located in the neighboring city of Fujieda.

Sun and Lee A. Wallis in Emergency Medicine Journal in 2012, describing a system utilizing community members as first responders in low-resource settings to provide immediate basic care during medical emergencies until certified medical personnel arrive. Since its creation, it has been deployed across twenty-three municipalities in South Africa and has been adapted for use in Zambia.  History  In low- and middle-income countries, trauma-related deaths disproportionately occur in the prehospital setting and are exacerbated by poorly resourced, poorly trained, or underdeveloped emergency medical services. With increasing globalization and subsequent industrialization, the global burden of injury affecting low- income countries had been projected to continue increasing disproportionately in developing countries. As many countries attempted to imitate high-income country emergency medical services infrastructure, these efforts were found to be financially unsustainable. Thus, a new strategy was needed to establish emergency medical systems in developing countries, and support their development into mature systems. In 2009, Sun and Wallis began training community members as emergency first aid responders in Manenberg, South Africa to treat the high levels of violence-related trauma present there, as first responders had previously been suggested by the WHO as a possible alternative. They found community members were dispersed and able to arrive on scene sooner than professional emergency medical providers. Experiencing success, they realized that using community members who want to assist was a possibility worth exploring. The EFAR system model was then designed to integrate into pre-existing or support the development of formal emergency care systems, or even serve as the foundation upon which a new emergency care system could be built. However, the EFAR system model has primarily served to alleviate the inconsistent and unreliable response times of ambulances and other emergency services in the Cape Town area. EFAR systems were implemented in two rural regions of Zambia in 2015, though no refinements were made to the course for the new setting.

The mountain, part of the Appalachian Mountains in southwest Virginia, borders the western side of the Great Valley of Virginia. Interstate 81 traverses the Great Valley as it takes travelers between Tennessee and West Virginia. Description The Walker Mountain Cluster contains four wildlands recognized by the Wilderness Society as “Mountain Treasures”, areas that are worthy of protection from logging and road construction. The areas in the cluster are: *Little Walker Mountain (conservation area) *Long Spur (conservation area) *Seven Sisters (conservation area) *Crawfish Valley (Bear Creek) Nearby wild areas: *Big Survey Wildlife Management Area Location and access Big Walker Mountain Fire Tower The cluster extends along Walker Mountain from its southern end near Rural Retreat, Virginia to its northern end near Pulaski, Virginia. Recent maps identify the mountain as “Walker Mountain”, but it is often referred to by the name “Big Walker Mountain”. Route 52 crosses Walker Mountain passing by Big Walker Lookout at the crest. Interstate I-77 passes under Walker Mountain in Big Walker Mountain Tunnel. There are many roads giving access to the area. Roads and trails in the cluster are shown on National Geographic Map 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley). The map also gives trail information. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land’s coordinates in the upper right of this page. Biological significance Bombus affinis, Rusty-patched Bumble BeeThe land form, climate, soils and geology of the Appalachian highlands, as well as its evolutionary history, have created one of the most diverse collection of plants and animals in the deciduous forests of the temperate world. The cluster's large tract of land supports species, such as black bear and some bird species, that require extensive tracts of unbroken forest for survival. The cluster provides habitat for species that are critically imperiled, as indicated by their NatureServe conservation status. Among these are the Wytheville cave beetle, basil mountain mint, Rusty-patched Bumblebee, and a forest terrestrial community, the Northern White-Cedar Slope Forest. Geologic history The cluster is in the Ridge and Valley Province that extends along the western boundary of Virginia. The Ridge and Valley province is composed of long, relatively level-crested, ridges with highest elevations reaching over 3600 feet. The province marks the eastern boundary in the Paleozoic era of an older land surface on the east. It was uplifted and eroded during the Paleozoic with extensive folding and thrust-faulting. Resistant quartzite, conglomerates and sandstones form the ridge caps while less resistant shales and limestones eroded to form the intervening valleys. The province is part of the Appalachian Mountains. Walker Mountain extends from Abingdon to the New River, where the ridge of Walker Mountain continues across the river but is now named Sinking Creek Mountain. There are other ridges on both sides of Walker Mountain with names that change as they move northeast. On the west is Little Mountain with a name change to Brushy Mountain. On the east another ridge, first called Little Brushy Mountain, becomes Brushy Mountain, then changes back to Little Brushy, then Brushy, then Little Walker and then, where the ridgeline is broken by the New River, it becomes Brushy Mountain again. The Tennessee Valley Divide crosses the southern end of the cluster. Bear Creek is part of the Tennessee River Drainage, while other creeks in the cluster are part of the New River Drainage. The Crawfish Valley is underlain by black shale formed in a sea without life. The sea had two layers that did not mix. Organic matter in the upper layer dropped into the lower layer depleting its oxygen forming a black mud. As time progressed, the black mud formed a black shale. Pyrite was also deposited in the valley leaving an acid soil which is infertile and was avoided by early settlers who wanted to grow crops. Cultural history Wytheville County Court HousePulaski, on the north, and Wytheville, on the south, are the two largest towns near the cluster. Pulaski was developed as a stopping point for the railroad between Roanoke and Bristol. Incorporated in 1886, it was once a major industrial center with railroad repair shops, textile factories and lumber mills. Wytheville was incorporated in 1839. Its proximity to lead mines, and the only salt works in the south, brought the attention of northern armies during the civil war. A union cavalry effort to tear up the railroad line in 1863 was countered by the home guards of the confederate forces Other clusters Other clusters of the Wilderness Society's \\"Mountain Treasures\\" in the Jefferson National Forest (north to south): *Glenwood Cluster *Craig Creek Cluster *Barbours Creek-Shawvers Run Cluster *Sinking Creek Valley Cluster *Mountain Lake Wilderness Cluster *Angels Rest Cluster *Kimberling Creek Cluster *Garden Mountain Cluster *Mount Rogers Cluster *Clinch Ranger District Cluster See also *Big Survey *Big Walker Lookout References Further reading * Stephenson, Steven L., A Natural History of the Central Appalachians, 2013, West Virginia University Press, West Virginia, . * Davis, Donald Edward, Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians, 2000, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia. .

He spent his entire life in Upper Mesopotamia, alternating between coenobitic (community-based) and eremitic (solitary) monasticism, with a preference for the latter. At the time of his death, he was serving as the abbot of a community of monks. John was a prolific writer in Syriac. A great number of his sermons, treatises, maxims and letters have survived. Translated into several languages in the centuries after his death, they were rarely read within the Church of the East (even being banned between the 780s and the 820s) but circulated widely in other Christian traditions throughout Asia, Africa and Europe. Life The 14th-century Syriac writer ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha, in his Catalogue of Books, mistakenly dated John of Dalyatha's life to the first half of the 6th century. This was widely accepted into the 20th century, when it was finally demonstrated that John in fact belongs to the 8th century. John was born around 690 in the village of Ardamut, northeast of Mosul in the Syriac-speaking region of Beth Nuhadra, part of the Syrian province of the Umayyad Caliphate. As a child, he studied the Bible, liturgy and patristics in the local church in preparation for a priestly or monastic vocation. As a youth, he paid regular visits to the monastery of Mar Aphnimaran to read ascetic literature, and he practised fasting and keeping vigils. When he was old enough he entered the coenobitic monastery of Mar Yozadaq in the mountains of Beth Qardu. He may have been drawn to this monastery because it had been that of the Syriac writer Narsai over a century earlier. As a novice he was under the instruction of a certain Blessed Stephen, himself a disciple of Mar Yozadaq. After seven years living in the community of Mar Yozadaq, John received permission to live as a hermit. He retreated north to the mountains of Beth Dalyatham—the \\"house of the vine- branches\\" or \\"vine-shoots\\"—at an elevation of . In his writings, John mentions his mountainous surrounding only once, in Letter 37. Because he spent most of his life in solitude and is not known to have ever visited a town, he probably never met a Muslim nor heard the Muslim call to prayer, the adhān. In his old age, when he was too weak to continue on his own, John returned to Beth Qardu. A community of monks gathered around him and elected him their abbot or superior. As abbot he created a new rule for novices. He served as abbot until his death around 780. Because John belonged to a monastic circle accused, probably incorrectly, of the heresies of Messalianism and Sabellianism, his works were banned after his death by the Patriarch Timothy I at a synod held in 786/787 or 790. Joseph Hazzaya was condemned at the same synod. John was later rehabilitated by the Patriarch Ishoʿbar Nun (governed 823–828). Writings John left behind 25 sermons (or discourses) and 51 letters, as well as a set of maxims (kephalaia) called the Ru'us al-Ma'rifah, variously translated Chapters of Understanding, Chapters of Wisdom or Kephalaia on Knowledge. Probably because of the condemnation of Timothy I, his writings survive in their original language (Syriac) only in manuscripts of the Syriac Orthodox tradition opposed to the Church of the East. They largely circulated anonymously, attributed only to the \\"spiritual elder\\", \\"divine elder\\" or just \\"elder\\", although there are some attributed to \\"Mar John the Elder\\", mar being a Syriac honorific meaning saint or reverend. Only in the 15th century did scholars begin to identify the author of the works as either John of Dalyatha or John bar Penkaye. Modern scholars are in general agreement that the first identification is correct, although Brian Colless has suggested that the two Johns are one and the same person. Many of John's works were translated into Arabic, Ethiopic (Ge'ez) and Greek. Four of his sermons falsely attributed to Isaac of Nineveh and his Letter 15 falsely attributed to Dorotheus of Gaza were translated into Greek, and thence into Latin and other European languages during the Middle Ages. John's works were all written for the benefit of ascetics. They discuss monastic living and the glory and beauty of God. He had a strong perfectionist streak. His recommended path took a devotee through repentance, ascetic exercises, purity, serenity and finally prefection, relying heavily on Matthew 5:48 (\\"Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect\\") and Matthew 5:8 (\\"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God\\"). Ever the mystic, he clarifies that the pure shall see God only \\"in their heart\\".

Born in the village of Mukhomornoye, Anadyrsky District, Kymytval was the daughter of a reindeer herder, and was called \\"Rul-tyne\\" () at birth. Her parents died when she was young, as did her twin brother, whereupon she was renamed \\"Kymytval\\", Chukchi for \\"worm\\", in an attempt to ward off evil. She first attended boarding school before entering the Anadyr Pedagogical College in 1958, from which she graduated the following year; it was at this time she began to write poetry, publishing her first volume, in Chukchi, in Magadan in 1960. In this same year she entered the Higher Party School of Khabarovsk, and soon thereafter she became deputy editor of the Sovetskaya Chukotka newspaper. She went to Moscow for further study in 1966 and 1967, and in 1968 published her first volume of verse for children. She continued to write plays and poems for children, developing a relationship with the Magadan Puppet Theater. Kymytval lived in Magadan for many years before her death. Late in life she was incapacitated by a series of strokes; she died in Abinsk, in the home of her daughter. Kymytval wrote lyric poetry, and concerned herself with descriptions of the landscape in which she lived. Some of her work has been translated into Russian. A member of the Writers' Union since 1962, she received the Order of the Badge of Honor and the Medal \\"For Labour Valour\\" in 1988.

As an artist, however, he had his greatest impact in tragic roles, such as the title role in Strindberg's Erik XIV, Oswald in Ghosts, and Earl Harald in Sigurd Slembe. Nordrum had his film debut with a minor role in Tante Pose (1940), and he played notable roles in films including Vi gifter oss (1951), Vildanden (1963), and Liv (1967). Nordrum also made a strong impression as a pianist in Sverre Udnæs's Aske on NRK's Television Theater in 1973. Nordrum was married to the Norwegian-born Swedish actress Lillebil Kjellén.

The song was written by Marina, Ben Berger, Ryan McMahon, and Ryan Rabin, while produced by Sam de Jong and Captain Cuts. It was released for digital download and streaming as the album's second single on 1 March 2019 by Atlantic Records. Marina cited the song as a result of the creative freedom she demanded, lacking from her previous albums, when creating it. It is a synth-pop and electro ballad that was often compared to other releases in Marina's catalogue. A love song, the lyrics describe a couple who have worked hard to achieve a desirable relationship. \\"Superstar\\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics upon release. Depending on the review, Marina's lyrics for the song were either largely appreciated or considered careless. The song was included on the setlist for her fourth concert tour, the Love + Fear Tour (2019). An acoustic version of the song appears on Marina's seventh extended play, Love + Fear (Acoustic) (2019). A music video for the acoustic version was released in September 2019 and directed by Nikko LaMere. It depicts Marina dancing and singing in a dimly lit room, while giving the impression of being underwater.  Background and release  In order to officially begin a new chapter in her career, Marina announced via Twitter in 2018 that she would be dropping \\"and the Diamonds\\" from her stage name in order to release music under the mononym Marina (stylised in all caps). She explained that, \\"It took me well over a year to figure out that a lot of my identity was tied up in who I was as an artist... and there wasn’t much left of who I was.\\" After her announcement, Marina released her first new single under the new name, \\"Baby\\" with Clean Bandit. She announced Love + Fear on 14 February 2019, her fourth studio album and first as Marina. The track listing was revealed the same day, which unveiled \\"Superstar\\" as the second track on the album. Conceptually, Love + Fear is a double album that is composed of two segments with each one exploring psychologist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' theory that humans are only capable of experiencing the aforementioned two emotions. \\"Superstar\\" appears on the Love section of the album, which is devoted to songs with lyrics detailing positive thoughts and emotions. Marina also revealed that the song is featured on a part of the album that she specifically asked her record label Atlantic Records to set aside for her. She justified the request, explaining that she had not always had creative control for her previous projects and did not want this to be repeated on Love + Fear. The song was written by Marina, Ben Berger, Ryan McMahon, and Ryan Rabin, while production being handled by Sam de Jong and Captain Cuts. Marina recorded her vocals for the track at Joel Little's Golden Age recording studios in Los Angeles. \\"Superstar\\" was released for digital download and streaming in various countries on 1 March 2019 through Atlantic Records. It served as the second single from Love + Fear, following \\"Handmade Heaven\\" earlier in the year. A Promotional CD single, intended for radio airplay, was distributed throughout the Benelux region of Europe in 2017 by Atlantic Records and the Warner Music Group. An acoustic version of the song was later recorded and released as the fourth track on Marina's sixth extended play, Love + Fear (Acoustic), on 13 September 2019. It was produced by English musician Benjamin Fletcher.  Composition and lyrics  Prior to the release of \\"Handmade Heaven\\" in February 2019, Marina revealed on Twitter that the song would have little to no indication of what the rest of Love + Fear would sound like. Musically, \\"Superstar\\" is a synth-pop and electro track. A contributor to Billboard described the production as a \\"shimmering backdrop of pulsating beats and gently sweeping keys\\". Idolator's Mike Wass compared the electro sound of \\"Superstar\\" to the songs on Marina's second studio album Electra Heart (2012). NME reviewer Douglas Greenwood called the track a \\"synth-driven pop ballad that could soundtrack a dozen sports cars careering off a cliff in a Bond film\\". Lake Schatz from Consequence of Sound described Marina's vocals on the track as \\"almost operatic\\" and noted the understated presence of a piano. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, \\"Superstar\\" is set in the time signature of common time, and has a moderate tempo of 97 beats per minute. The key of the song is in B minor, with Marina's vocal range spanning from A3 to E5 in scientific pitch notation, acting as a mezzo-soprano. Throughout the song's verses, her vocal range advances in the chord progression of B–F♯–G-A–F♯-G. Instrumentation for the track is provided by Captain Cuts and de Jong, who contribute with keyboards. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and engineered by John Hanes. Mastering of the track was handled by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City. Marina has referred to \\"Superstar\\" as a \\"true love song\\". In an interview with Apple Music, during the release week of Love + Fear, she spoke about the process she went through when writing the song: \\"I think [...] when your mind is clearer you write sparse, simple songs. I also really like how the song celebrates the hard work that goes into a good relationship.\\"References regarding the release of Love + Fear on Apple Music:  Lauren Murphy from The Irish Times also called it a love song and cited the line, \\"So impossible to dream when you're far away from me\\" as evidence. Following an instrumental intro to the song, Marina begins the first verse by singing: \\"Before I met you, I pushed them all away / Soon as I kissed you, I wanted you to stay\\". She alternates to, \\"You never judge me for any of my fears / Never turn your back, always keep my body near\\" at the beginning of the second verse.  Critical reception  \\"Superstar\\" was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom discussed the lyrics. A Billboard contributor wrote a positive review of the song, calling it \\"romantic\\". Greenwood acclaimed the song, calling attention to the lyrics, and named it a \\"delicious decoy\\" on Love + Fear. Wass highlighted the song's lyrics and its \\"even gushier\\" chorus. Additionally, he compared the song to several of Marina's prior releases, and considered the combination of elements to be \\"a very good thing\\". Allison Stubblebine from Nylon also enjoyed the song and considered her favorite part to be the lyrics, \\"All of the days that we spend apart / My love is a planet revolving your heart\\". On the other hand, Peyton Thomas of Pitchfork called the same lyrics \\"sloppy\\" and compared its \\"incoherent\\" style to a technique first used by Swedish producer and songwriter Max Martin. Ben Niesen from Atwood Magazine said he expected something more from the song, describing its lyrics as generic and a part of \\"common poetry\\". Nick Lowe from Clash was unimpressed by the track, writing that it \\"showcase[s] her excellent songwriting but [is] let down by lacklustre production\\". The acoustic version of \\"Superstar\\" was also reviewed by critics. Mike Nied of Idolator provided a positive review, writing that Marina \\"breathes new life\\" into the song. Riana Buchman from WRBB was less impressed by the song, saying that \\"Superstar\\" and \\"Karma\\" sound like \\"drab copies of the originals\\" and ended up \\"clutter[ing]\\" Love + Fear (Acoustic).  Promotion  alt=A color photograph of Marina performing live with backup singers while flowing their arms. Coinciding with the release of \\"Superstar\\" as a single, a lyric video using a looped clip of Marina in a black dress while floating in a pool of water, was released on 1 March 2019. A music video for the acoustic version of the song was later released to Marina's YouTube channel on 13 September of that same year. The video was the first of three released to promote Love + Fear (Acoustic) and was filmed during the last week of August 2019. It was directed by American photographer Nikko LaMere and produced by AJR Films. The video opens with Marina in a dimly lit room, sprawled out on the ground and her hair is arranged in patterns that replicate the shape of a heart symbol. A filter used on the floor gives the appearance that Marina is performing while being underwater. \\"Superstar\\" was also included on the set list for Marina's Love + Fear Tour in 2019. It was performed in between Love + Fear single \\"To Be Human\\" and her 2015 single \\"Froot\\". Roman Gokhman from Riff, reviewing Marina's show in San Francisco, was mixed about her performance of the song. He called the song \\"bassy\\" and wrote that it \\"didn't really stand out that much from the rest of the set\\".

Their main objective is to help animals which are in pain and are suffering and to nurture them back to a happy and healthy life. It is located at the very heart of the city. Animal lovers from across the city bring pets and stray animals which need care and safety. The facility receives a wide variety of birds and animals at its rehabilitation centre. They also have a mobile treatment van in which they treat animals which do not require hospitalisation and can be treated on the spot. Jivdaya doctors have been awarded 1st and 2nd place in the National Surgery Conference. This facility has also been approved by the Forest Department to treat scheduled animals and birds. History The Jivdaya Charitable Trust was started as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in 2007 and its first facility was set up in 2008. It is registered under the Bombay Charity Act with registration No. E.18173/Ahmedabad and is also recognised by the Animal Welfare Board of India with recognition code No. GJ-249/2010. It has an 80 G- Tax Exemption Certificate and also has a Foreign Currency Registration Account so that people living abroad can donate to them. It was started by Ms. Gira Shah as a result of suffering she saw among the animals when they were not given proper care and love. She saw that the stray animals, who could not speak up for themselves, were not being treated properly and there was no one to help them when they fell ill or were injured. The vision of JCT is to \\"Create Public Awareness\\", especially among the new generation so that they become conscious of their responsibilities towards the animals. Their mission is to \\"Provide BEST and FREE medical treatment to all animals\\", \\"Provide Shelter to the ill and injured animals\\" and to \\"Promote Vegetarianism\\".  Functions, campaigns and aid provided  Save The Bird Campaign = Save The Bird Campaign: = Jivdaya started this campaign because it encountered uncountable fatalities of birds during the Uttarayan festival. According to Ms Gira, many people start flying kites early in the morning and this is also the time when the birds fly out in the search of food. This leads to a number of fatalities. Ms Gira believes that if people fly kites during later hours, fatalities would be reduced. In order to cope up with such a large number of fatalities during the Uttarayan festival, Jivdaya launched a special helpline number and also calls for people to volunteer during this festival. People who volunteer are called before the festival starts and are given proper training to rescue injured birds and other animals. Each area has its own helpline number and therefore, as soon as Jivdaya receives a call on any of these numbers, it alerts the volunteer group in that area. The volunteer group goes onto the place of incident along with proper first aid, baskets, towels and soaps. The first thing that they do there is provide first aid to the animal(s) and then bring the bird/animal to the centre for further treatment. Jivdaya had attended to more than 2,390 birds in Ahmedabad, which is the heartland of the kite flying festival, during 2017 and approximately 490 of them had died. Sherwin Everett, a volunteer with the JCT, said that casualties of the kite-flying season started trickling in from November. The reason being that many people had started flying kites as soon as November ended. She also said that among the species which were rescued in recent years were various endangered and migratory birds. Another volunteer, Shastri pointed out the danger to vultures (which are already endangered because of the veterinary drug diclofenac) because of kite flying. She further added that \\"The eggs of the white-rumped vultures hatch in January and the birds scout for food for fledglings at least three times a day. Injured birds leave fledglings starving, further impacting their numbers.\\"\\"Uttarayan: Concerns over bird fatalities during kite festival\\" In January 2019, JCT recorded 100 bird fatalities even before Uttarayan started. It had treated around 945 birds which they received during 14 and 15 January 2019. There were around 300 volunteers who treated these birds. Also, Jivdaya invites a force of 50 doctors every year during the festival of Uttarayan, from across India and other countries, and at least 30 birds are treated at the clinics. Between 14 and 15 January, the volunteers of Jivdaya Charitable Trust had reportedly treated close to 945 injured birds, including endangered species like rump vultures, cranes and barn owls. The biggest issue faced by Jivdaya during this campaign is the issue of funding. It has to spend around 8 to 9 lakhs (₹800,000 to 900,0000 or US$12,000) on this campaign every year. This money is spent on housing for visiting doctors, medical equipment and medicine. This takes up the majority of their grants. During an interview with The Times of India, Ms. Kalpan Shah, trustee at JCT, said that \\"Wing and leg injuries are most common among birds. However, some are so serious that they need amputation.In fact, many a time when people light firecrackers, the birds tend to faint due to severe trauma and fall and get injured.\\" = Feather implants = Birds whose feathers get damaged or clipped because of a number of reasons, including but not limited to coated manja (thread) during Uttarayan, are now getting a new lease of life thanks to JCT. In 2018, JCT carried out feather implants on four birds and in 2019, it is planning to carry out 2000 feather implants. This is the first of its kind initiative in Gujarat, India, where JCT is conducting free of cost feather implantation. Gira Shah, the managing trustee at JCT, said that \\"We were brainstorming on starting feather implantation for three years and finally kick-started it in 2017. We successfully carried out the procedure on four birds. One cannot spot the difference after the feather implantation.\\" She added, \\"The birds were kept in an aviary for a month and at the end of it they were found to be perfect.\\" She further said, \\"If even five feathers need to be changed, it will take minimum one hour. The birds are kept under anaesthesia during the procedure. There is better planning and specification to execute. There is tail implant too.\\" = Blood donation by dogs = One of the most interesting things that happen in JCT is that whenever a dog is need of blood, another dog with the same blood group donates the blood. A dog donated blood to another once and the team of doctors sat beside them over the weekend to make sure the healing process was complete. JCT was the first NGO to bring up and successfully implement this technique in Ahmedabad. It came up with this idea when a dog was brought to JCT who had met with an accident and had lost a lot of blood. The doctors decided to do blood transfusion and it was a success. Proper care was taken of both the dogs, the recipient as well as the donor, after the surgery/treatment took place. The Amdavadis (name given to people of Ahmedabad) now know that there is someone to share the responsibility of curing stray dogs and hurt birds. = Aid to the speechless: = Jivdaya provides proper aid to the animals that are in need. It does not differentiate between them based on their breed or disease, and hence treat every animal equally. Majority of the cases which are brought to JCT are of breeds which are Indian or stray. This is because many doctors in private animal hospitals hesitate and are unwilling to provide aid to the stray breed, and many don't even bother to admit these Indian breeds into their hospitals. While most of the private doctors and hospitals work for fixed hours and don't bother what eventually happens to the animal, Jivdaya works for the animals and though it has fixed opening hours, the closing hours are not fixed. This is because if there is a case/treatment pending at Jivdaya, then it does not matter whether the doctors close at 6 pm or provide treatment to the animal until 11 at night. The primary aim is the safety and health of these animals and not monetary benefit.

It is the first video game the developers made under their newly incorporated company 'Alcachofa Soft'.  Production  = Development = Alcachofa Soft by this point had been around for a few years; the developers' first game had been 1996's Dráscula: The Vampire Strikes Back, and despite it having good reviews they were not overly pleased with their creation - they endeavoured to make their following projects more ambitious and innovative. The process of creating the game was \\"laborious and long\\". The game incorporated \\"interactive humour\\", and a narrative inspiration from Treasure Island. The team wanted to have a 2D graphic adventure, and to distinguish themselves from the soon to be released Monkey Island 3, they hand drew the characters rather than on a computer. Alcachofa Soft suggested that their game had \\"one of the best dubbing, if not the best, in the history of video games in Spanish\\", including their main character portrayed by regular Will Smith dubber and the voice of Fry in Futurama Iván Muelas. The soundtrack was recorded at Albert Moraleda's studio in Barcelona by a section of musicians from the Vallés Symphony Orchestra. Its technology was provided by DirectX, while the design featured hand-painted backgrounds, and 16 bit colour graphics. The game was in development for over two years. The soundtrack included the \\" Canción del Pirata Campeón \\" composed by Emilio de Paz and performed by the group \\"Los Inhumanos \\". = Release = The game became Alcachofa Soft's first effort entirely independently, without an publisher or external distributor. Meristation felt the game had an opportunity to captivate the national adventure market though felt it was possible for global permeation. The developers put out a special message requesting players not to pirate the game. As part of its coverage of the game, CTV published a multi-part section entitled How El Tesoro de Isla Alcachofa was made. In 2000, Alcachofa Soft distributed more than 100,000 units of both “Isla Alcachofa”and “Mortadelo y Filemón”, just within Spanish territories. The developer aimed to release a second version of the title featuring a 1024x768 resolution and new puzzles. In 2009, Alcachofa Soft undertook a new distribution strategy by launching an “Alcachofa Essentials” label under which they sold low-cost downloadable version of its best classics, such as “Mortadelo y Filemón: Una aventura de cine” o “El Tesoro de Isla Alcachofa” with improvements such as unpublished “extra” material.  Plot and gameplay  Jim Guinderslifth stands in a building. The player has opened the inventory across the top of the screen. The plot revolves around a petty thief named Jim Guinderslifth who has caught wind of an expedition leaving Bristol to discover a new continent. He soon realises that they are on a quest to find the lost treasure of Pirate Frink which is supposedly held at Alcachofa Island.  Critical reception  In a contemporary review, Meristation suggested the game would appeal to those who were nostalgic for the gameplay and narrative of The Secret of Monkey Island, adding that the title was coherent, balanced and fun. In a retrospective piece, Meristation deemed it competent, but lacking in the qualities to make it a high value video game. In another article, they mentioned that while many Spanish video game received poor reviews, this is one game that was saved from negative criticism and further deemed it \\"especially remarkable\\" within the context of Alcachofa Soft's output. Vandal deemed it \\"most ambitious\\". Conversational Adventures Newsletter Number 44 commented on the \\"crazy sense of humor and the hilarious dialogues\\". Historia del software español de entretenimiento felt that considering the game's tiny budget, the quality is \\"remarkable\\". La Mazmorra Abandon assessed the game was a \\"not very ambitious title\\" and suggested it was created out of a developer passion project rather than to complete in the adventure gaming market. Gry Online felt it was a less classic, \\"lighter\\" example of the pirate video gaming genre.

As a result, he turned his production crew to Gujarati cinema to keep them employed. The film is based on local folk legend of bandit Jesal Jadeja who was preached and reformed by Kathi saint-woman Toral. Their memorial shrines are located in Anjar in Kutch district, Gujarat. It was the first Eastmancolor Gujarati film and was a debut film of Upendra Trivedi and Ramesh Mehta. It was shot in Orvo technicolor. As the Laxmi Studio at Baroda was not yet commissioned, the film was partly shot in Kutch and partly in Mumbai.  Soundtrack  Release and reception The film was released in 1971. The film was exempted from the tax by the Government of Gujarat to encourage production of the Gujarati films. The film proved to be one of the biggest hits of Gujarati cinema and ran for 25 weeks in theatres. It won 17 awards from the Government of Gujarat.

Byrne is notable for not only her cancer research, but the uncovering of academic fraud and junk science in cancer research. As a result of her and her colleague's investigations, 17 papers have been retracted, and others have been noted. As a result, the journal Nature rated Byrne as one of their \\"Ten people who mattered\\" in 2017.  Research interests  Byrne has spent her career investigating adult and childhood cancer. She specializes in biobanking, cancer genetics as well as research integrity. Her PhD involved mapping the loss of the chromosome 11p15 loci in embryonal tumours.  Career  Byrne is currently (2020) employed by NSW Health Pathology as the Director of Biobanking. She leads the NSW Health biobanking program, including the NSW Health Statewide Biobank (NSWHSB). Her other positions include Professor of Molecular Oncology, at the School of Medical Sciences, at the University of Sydney. In addition, Byrne was previously the Deputy Director of a group called the Kids Cancer Alliance, which is a Translational Cancer Research Center within the Cancer Institute of NSW. Fraud investigation While reading scientific articles on cancer research, Byrne noticed odd patterns in publications about a particular gene. The papers described 'strikingly similar' experiments on a gene that has been linked with childhood leukemia and breast cancer. She recognized the particular gene, because she had previously led the team that had cloned the gene 20 years earlier. Her experience on that gene made her realize that all of the papers, which were all from China, were describing the same nucleotide sequence yet some of the papers were describing this sequence wrongly. A nucleotide sequence is the specific order of letters which describes how a particular piece of DNA is composed. She noticed that the papers were describing wrong nucleotide sequences in the context of laboratory experiments performed with cancer cell lines. These wrong sequences implies that: (1) either the studies were not examining what they reported, or (2) the experiments had not been conducted as described. The implication is that each paper contains the seeds of bad research, that other papers could possibly build upon. Further evidence of fraud or junk science was suggested as other papers used the same sequences for the opposite purposes. This means that \\"a sequence used as a positive control in one research paper was used as a negative control in another\\". As a result of her and her colleague Cyril Labbe's investigations, 17 papers have been retracted, and about five suspicious papers have been noted. A colleague described the importance of her whistleblowing cancer work as \\"finding fraud and bad science\\". \\"Projects like Jennifer’s actually are a key part of that. There are a lot more people looking at papers, there are a lot more available online, so people are finding more issues.\\" Undark.org described her work as a \\"fight for dubious cancer research\\".

His father may have helped lead the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 and Naranjo initially opposed co-operation with the Spanish, successfully escaping from Spanish custody. After 7 October 1692 Naranjo appears to have come to terms with the Spanish, working for the governor of New Mexico Diego de Vargas. Shortly afterwards Naranjo killed his brother Lucas, who was leading an Indian rebellion, and sent his head to Vargas. Naranjo was appointed an alcalde and leader of Indian auxiliary troops, serving on expeditions against the Apache and the Pueblo who had fled to El Quartelejo. In 1720 he was appointed chief scout and leader of auxiliary troops on the Villasur expedition, despite having opposed it. He was killed on 14 August 1720 when the expedition was attacked by Pawnee and Otoe forces.  Early life  Naranjo was a Pueblo Indian born circa 1662 to Domingo Naranjo (whom Angelico Chavez believed instigated the Pueblo Revolt of 1680). The grandson of a black freedman and an Indian woman, he was nicknamed el Mulato or el negro. Chavez believed Naranjo's mother to have been a mestizo from Analco as José was lighter skinned than his father. Shortly after the revolt José was captured by men working for the Spanish governor Antonio de Otermin but refused to betray his tribe and Otermin ordered him brought to Guadalupe del Paso. José escaped on 8 January and found refuge with the Northern Pueblo Indians – perhaps joining his father at Taos.  In Spanish service  José Naranjo was discovered at Taos by the army of Diego de Vargas on 7 October 1692. It is at this point that Naranjo seems to have switched allegiance to the Spanish cause. He seems to have accompanied Vargas on his campaign to reoccupy New Mexico, witnessing a number of skirmishes and battles before settling at Santa Cruz. On 13 June 1696 he learnt that his brother Lucas was leading an insurrection against the Spanish. Naranjo informed the Spanish authorities, tracked down and killed his brother before presenting his head to Vargas. In 1700 he was rewarded for his actions by appointment as alcalde of the Zuni and leader of their auxiliary troops, which fought for the Spanish. In this role he successfully escorted Spanish missionaries sent to the Hopi tribe, and defended them from attack. Naranjo helped facilitate the surrender of Santa Clara, Durango by bringing Indian leaders to negotiate with the Spanish at Santa Fe and also negotiated the surrender of the Tano tribe. He returned to Taos and was able to persuade the Indians there to build a church and host a Spanish priest (as had been attempted several decades earlier). Naranjo accompanied Vargas on his Apache campaign as leader of Indian scouts, and was present when Vargas was killed at Bernalillo in 1704. Naranjo had learnt the Apache language through a relationship with an Apache woman and acted as an interpreter between the Spanish and the Apache. In 1707 he joined Juan de Ulibarrí's expedition to capture Pueblo Indians who had fled to El Quartelejo (in modern Kansas). Ulibarrí named a watering hole used by the expedition after Naranjo. By 1707 Naranjo was said to be married to a woman named Catalina and had seven children. Naranjo was appointed chief of all Pueblo auxiliary troops by Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares – the Viceroy of New Spain from 1711–16 – becoming the first Indian to hold that post. He led his troops on several campaigns against the Navajo and in 1719 petitioned the Governor of New Mexico to launch an expedition against the Ute people.  Villasur expedition  In 1720 he joined the Villasur expedition as chief scout and leader of 70 auxiliary troops. Intended to discover French people reputed to be living amongst the tribes of the Great Plains (Spain was then fighting the War of the Quadruple Alliance against France) the expedition went \\"farther into the interior than anyone from Spanish America had ever gone before\\". Reaching the Platte River the expedition was surprised by an attack of the Pawnee and Otoe on 14 August in which 46 of the party were killed including Naranjo and Villasur. The survivors retreated to Santa Fe but the expedition was a disaster; some one third of the military forces of New Mexico were lost. Naranjo had advised the governor of New Mexico, Antonio Valverde y Cosío, not to send the expedition but had been overruled.

Most of the adopted resolutions are lobbied for by an ultra-conservative, Catholic organisation . While unenforceable and primarily symbolic, the declarations represent an attempt to stigmatize LGBT people. On 18 December 2019, the European Parliament voted, 463 to 107, to condemn the more than 80 such zones in Poland. In July 2020, the Provincial Administrative Courts (Polish: Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny) in Gliwice and Radom ruled that the \\"LGBT ideology free zones\\" established by the local authorities in Istebna and Klwów gminas respectively are null and void, stressing that they violate the constitution and are discriminatory against members of the LGBT community living in those counties. Since July 2020, the European Union has denied funding from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund to municipalities that have adopted \\"LGBT-free\\" declarations, which are in violation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Poland is the only member state to have an opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it had signed upon its accession to the EU in 2004. In addition, several European sister cities have frozen their partnerships with the Polish municipalities in question.  Background  August 2019 protest in support of Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski's statements on LGBT. Sign reads: \\"away ([down]) with leftist ideological totalitarianism\\", precz (go away) is also on the crossed-out gay pride flag In February 2019, Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafał Trzaskowski signed a declaration supporting LGBTQ rights, and announced his intention to follow World Health Organization guidelines and integrate LGBT issues into the Warsaw school system sex education curricula. Law and Justice (PiS) politicians objected to the program saying it would sexualize children. PiS party leader Jarosław Kaczyński responded to the declaration, calling LGBT rights \\"an import\\" that threatens Poland. According to The Daily Telegraph, the declaration \\"enraged and galvanized\\" conservative politicians and conservative media in Poland, the \\"LGBT-free zone\\" declarations emerging as a reaction to the Warsaw declaration. The British newspaper further argues that the conservative establishment is fearful of a liberal transition that may erode the Catholic Church's power in Poland like the transition around the Irish Church. Decreasing Church attendance, rising secularization, and sexual abuse scandals have put pressure on the conservative position. In May 2019, Polish police arrested civil-rights activist Elżbieta Podleśna for putting up posters of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa with the halo painted rainbow colours for the charge of offending religious sentiment, which is illegal in Poland. Two weeks prior to the 2019 European Parliament election, a documentary on child sex abuse in the Church, was released online. It was expected to hurt the Church-aligned PiS electorally, and was responded to by PiS leader Kaczyński speaking heatedly of the Polish nation and children as \\"being under attack by deviant foreign ideas\\", which led conservative voters to rally around PiS. According to feminist scholar Agnieszka Graff, \\"The attack on LGBT was triggered by the [Warsaw] Declaration, but that was just a welcome excuse\\", as PiS sought to woo the rural-traditional demographic and needed a scapegoat to replace migrants. In August 2019, the Archbishop of Kraków Marek Jędraszewski said \\"LGBT ideology\\" was like a \\"rainbow plague\\" in a sermon commemorating the Warsaw uprising. Not long after, a drag queen simulated Jędraszewski's murder on stage, stirring controversy. , being openly gay in Poland's small towns and rural areas \\"[takes] increasing physical and mental fortitude\\" due to the efforts of Polish authorities and the Catholic Church, according to The Daily Telegraph. Public perceptions, however, have been becoming more tolerant of gay people. In 2001, the 41 percent of Poles surveyed stating that \\"being gay wasn't normal and shouldn't be tolerated\\" dropped to 24 percent in 2017, and the 5 percent who said \\"being gay was normal\\" in 2001 had grown to 16 percent in 2017.  Declarations  \\"LGBT-free zone motions\\" refer to resolutions passed by some of Polish gminas (municipalities), (Reprint at The Independent) powiats (counties), and voivodeships (provinces) who declared their attachment to conservative values in reaction to the Warsaw Declaration. While unenforceable, activists say the declared zones represent attempts to exclude the LGBT community and called the declarations \\"a statement saying that a specific kind of people is not welcome there.\\" The two documents declared by municipalities were a \\"Local Government Charter of The Rights of The Family\\", and a \\"Resolution against LGBT ideology\\". Both of these documents were labelled in media as \\"declarations of LGBT-free zones\\", but neither of them actually contain a statement of exclusion of LGBT people from any territory, activities or rights. The \\"Charter of Family Rights\\" focuses on family values in social policies and only refers to LGBT rights indirectly, such as by defining marriage as a relationship \\"between a man and a woman\\". The \\"Resolution against LGBT ideology\\" does not speak to LGBT people, but declares opposition to an \\"ideology of the LGBT movement\\", and condemns so-called \\"political correctness\\". An interactive map of Poland marking all municipalities which accepted either one or both of these resolutions, with links to their original texts, is available online, under the titles \\"Atlas of Hate\\". , around 30 different local governments have accepted such resolutions, including four voivodeships in the south-east of the country: Lesser Poland, Podkarpackie, Świętokrzyskie, and Lublin.

In 2019 it rebuked the Warsaw mayor's pro-LGBTQ declaration as \\"an attack on the family and children\\" and stated that LGBTQ was an \\"imported\\" ideology. After Archbishop Jędraszewski made his speech calling \\"LGBT ideology\\" a \\"rainbow plague\\", the Minister of National Defence Mariusz Błaszczak applauded the statement.  Stickers  The conservative Gazeta Polska newspaper issued \\"LGBT-free zone\\" stickers to readers. The Polish opposition and diplomats, including US ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher, condemned the stickers. Gazeta editor in chief Tomasz Sakiewicz replied to the criticism with: \\"what is happening is the best evidence that LGBT is a totalitarian ideology\\". The Warsaw district court ordered that distribution of the stickers should halt pending the resolution of a court case. However Gazeta editor dismissed the ruling saying it was \\"fake news\\" and censorship, and that the paper would continue distributing the stickers. Gazeta continued distribution of the stickers, but modified the decal to read \\"LGBT Ideology-Free Zone\\". In July Polish media chain Empik, the country's largest, refused to stock Gazeta Polska after it issued the stickers. In August 2019, a show organized by the Gazeta Polska Community of America scheduled for October 24 in Carnegie Hall in New York was cancelled after complaints of anti-LGBT ties led to artists pulling out of the show.  Demonstrations  rainbow flag canopy at 2019 Rzeszów equality march. the Confederate battle flagalt= In Rzeszów, after LGBT activists submitted a request to hold an equality march for gay rights in June 2019, PiS councillors drafted a resolution to make Rzeszów an \\"LGBT-free zone\\" as well as outlaw the event itself. Some 29 requests for counter-demonstrations reached city hall, which led mayor Tadeusz Ferenc, of the opposition Democratic Left Alliance, to ban the march due to security concerns. When the ban was then overturned by a court ruling, PiS councillors put forward a resolution outlawing \\"LGBT ideology\\", which was defeated by two votes. Following the violent events in the first Białystok equality march and the Gazeta Polska stickers a demonstration for tolerance was held in Gdańsk on 23 July 2019, with the slogan \\"zone free of zones\\" (). In Szczecin a demonstration under the slogan of \\"hate-free zone\\" () took place, and in Łódź left-wing politicians handed out \\"hate-free zone\\" stickers.  Reactions  = Support for declarations = Bożena Bieryło, a PiS councilwoman in Białystok County, said the legislation in Białystok county was required due to LGBT \\"provocations\\" and \\"demands\\" for sex education instruction. The national PiS party has encouraged the local declarations, with a PiS official handing out medals in Lublin to local politicians who supported the declarations. = Criticism of declarations = In July 2019, Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar stated that \\"the government is increasing homophobic sentiments\\" with remarks \\"on the margins of hate speech\\". Bodnar said he is preparing an appeal to the administrative court against the declarations, as according to Bodnar they are not only political but also have a normative character that affects the lives of people in the declared region. In July 2019, Warsaw city Councillor Marek Szolc and the (PTPA) released a legal opinion stating that LGBT-free zone declarations stigmatize and exclude people, reminding everyone of article 32 of the Constitution of Poland which guarantees equality and lack of discrimination. In August 2019, multiple LGBT community members stated that they feel unsafe in Poland. The left-wing Razem party stated: \\"Remember how the right [were scared] of the so-called [Muslim] no-go zones? Thanks to the same right, we have our own no-go zones.\\" Synagogue in Bydgoszcz, German-occupied Poland, 1939. Nazi banner proclaiming city is judenfrei (free of Jews). This image was tweeted by a representative of Robert Biedroń's party in response to the LGBT- free zones. Liberal politicians and media and human rights activists have compared the declarations to Nazi-era declarations of areas being judenfrei (free of Jews). Left-leaning Italian newspaper la Repubblica called it \\"a concept that evokes the term 'Judenfrei'\\". Campaign Against Homophobia director Slava Melnyk compared the declarations to \\"1933, when there were also free zones from a specific group of people.\\" Warsaw's deputy president Paweł Rabiej tweeted, \\"The German fascists created zones free of Jews. Apartheid, of blacks.\\" In March 2020, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a documentary on the opposition of the LGBT community in Poland against the introduction of LGBT-free zones in the country. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many within the LGBT community, began handing out rainbow facemasks and other P.P.E. - as a direct protest of the \\"LGBT-free zoning\\", within certain local government areas of Poland. On 17 August 2020, an open letter to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, was published urging the European Union \\"to take immediate steps in defense of basic European values [...] which have been violated in Poland\\" and expressing \\"a deep concern over the future of democracy in Poland\\". It also appealed to the Polish government to stop targeting sexual minorities as enemies and to withdraw support from organizations promoting homophobia. The signatories of the letter included among others: Pedro Almodóvar, Timothy Garton Ash, Margaret Atwood, John Banville, Judith Butler, John Maxwell Coetzee, Stephen Daldry, Luca Guadagnino, Ed Harris, Agnieszka Holland, Isabelle Huppert, Jan Komasa, Yorgos Lanthimos, Mike Leigh, Paweł Pawlikowski, Volker Schlöndorff, Stellan Skarsgård, Timothy Snyder, Olga Tokarczuk, Adam Zagajewski and Slavoj Žižek. In September 2020, the American presidential candidate Joe Biden also condemned LGBT-free zones in Poland via Twitter stating that \\"LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and “LGBT-free zones” have no place in the European Union or anywhere in the world\\". The \\"Atlas of Hate\\" organization, which keeps track of the anti-LGBT resolutions, was nominated for the Sakharov Prize by 43 MEPs. As of 2020, the watchdog group ILGA-Europe identified Poland's respect for LGBTI rights as the worst of all 27 EU countries. = Reaction from the European Union = On 18 December 2019, the European Parliament voted (463 to 107) in favour of condemning the more than 80 LGBT-free zones in Poland. Parliament demanded that \\"Polish authorities (are) to condemn these acts and (are) to revoke all resolutions attacking LGBT rights\\". According to the EU Parliament the zones are part of \\"a broader context of attacks against the LGBT community in Poland, which include growing hate speech by public and elected officials and public media, as well as attacks and bans on Pride marches and actions such as 'Rainbow Fridays'.\\". Based upon numerous complaints that \\"some local governments have adopted discriminatory declarations and resolutions targeting LGBT people\\", the European Commission wrote to the governors of five Voivodeships – Lublin, Łódź, Małopolska, Podkarpackie, and Świętokrzyskie – on 2 June 2020, instructing them to investigate local resolutions proclaiming LGBT-free zones or a \\"Charter of Family Rights\\", and whether such resolutions constituted discriminatory actions towards LGBT-identifying people or not. The letter can be seen as an extension of the 2019 vote in the European Parliament condemning the zones, as it notes that failure by Poland to adhere to common values of the European Union of “respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities”, as stated in Article 2 of the 2012 European Union Treaty could result in the loss of EU funds granted to the Republic of Poland in the future, such as European Structural and Investment. In her September 2020 State of the European Union speech, Ursula von der Leyen stated, \\"LGBTQI-free zones are humanity free zones. And they have no place in our Union.\\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 = International agreements = In February 2020, the French commune of Saint-Jean-de-Braye decided to suspend the partnership with the Polish city of Tuchów as a result of the controversial anti-LGBT resolution passed by the Tuchów authorities. In February 2020, the French commune of Nogent-sur-Oise suspended its partnership with the Polish city of Kraśnik as a reaction to the passing of an anti-LGBT resolution by the city authorities. In February 2020, the French region of Centre-Val de Loire suspended its partnership with the Lesser Poland Voivodeship as a response to the establishment of an \\"LGBT-free zone\\" resolution by the voivodeship's authorities. In May 2020, the German city of Schwerte ended its city partnership with the Polish city of Nowy Sącz after 30 years of cooperation due to the town's adoption of a resolution discriminating against LGBT people. In July 2020, the Dutch city of Nieuwegein as well as the French city of Douai ended their twin city agreements with the Polish city of Puławy due to a \\"gay free zone\\" proclamation made in the latter. On 12 October 2020, the Irish city of Fermoy ended its twin town agreement with Nowa Dęba after 14 years of cooperation as a reaction to the homophobic LGBT-free zone declaration adopted by the Polish city's authorities. In July 2020, the European Commissioner for Justice and Equality Helena Dalli announced that six Polish cities which adopted the \\"LGBT-free zones\\" would not be granted EU funds related to financing projects within the EU twinning project framework as a direct consequence of their discriminatory policies directed against members of the LGBT community. The decision met with criticism from the Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro, however, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen defended the decision adding that \\"Our treaties ensure that every person in Europe is free to be who they are, live where they like, love who they want, and aim as high as they want.\\" However, on 18 August, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro announced that the town of Tuchow in southern Poland would now receive 250,000 zlotys ($67,800) from the ministry's Justice Fund, to compensate for the EU funding reversal. In September 2020, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced that the Polish municipalities which introduced the LGBT-free zones would be denied the EEA and Norway Grants whose aim is the reduction of social and economic disparities in the European Economic Area (EEA). Poland is the biggest beneficiary of these funds and could potentially lose millions of euros of financial aid. The suspension of funds only applies to the government bodies that have themselves adopted resolutions and does not apply to non-governmental organizations that operate in the LGBT-free zones. In September 2020, a group of MEPs published a letter addressed to the European Olympic Committees (EOC) in which they demanded to respect the rights of LGBT athletes and expressed an idea to host the 2023 European Games, which had been scheduled to take place in Kraków, in a different location due to the region's LGBT-free zone status.

Reception The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings said \\"When Hooker's Vee- Jay sides first appeared, as singles, they were heartening indications that honest and ungimmicky blues were still being made; heard at intervals, as they were, they gave a hard-won pleasure that one might not stop to examine the detail. Taken at a draught, decades later they are a little less compelling. Putting Hooker with an efficient band was presumably intended to relieve him of rhythmic chores and give him room to flex vocal or instrumental muscle, but he gains little from it; he is always his most interesting rhythm provider, and neither his singing, nor his guitar playing is particularly enhanced by having free rein. Indeed in most group contexts he is ill equipped to be a lead guitarist at all. Still, there are many worthwhile performances to be found\\". AllMusic reviewer Lindsay Planer stated: \\"I'm John Lee Hooker was first issued in 1959 during his tenure with Vee Jay and is \\"the Hook\\" in his element as well as prime. ...

He was the 38th pontiff of Uttaradi Math and served the pontificate from 1911-1942. He was considered most active and zealous pontiffs of 20th century. He was an untiring propagandist, the best debater of his days and almost a terror to his adversaries in philosophical polemics. It was at his initiative and inspiration that a splendid Marathi translation of Madhva's Brahmasutra Bhashya, with the Tatvaprakashika of Jayatirtha was published for the benefit of a large number of followes of Madhvacharya in Maharashtra. He made extensive tours all over India, held disputations and published polemical tracts and phamplets in many languages in North and South India for free distribution. He started, Sriman Madhva Siddhanta Abhivruddhikarini Sabha around 1905-06 and registered in 1930 to promote the study of Sanskrit literature and philosophy, particularly the study of Dvaita Philosophy, to hold meetings and conferences of Madhva scholars. Biography Satyadhyana Tirtha was born into an ancient Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin family of erudite scholars on 24 December 1872 in a village called Chikodi in Karnataka to Korlahalli Jayaramacharya (Purvashrama name of Satyadhira Tirtha) and Krishnabai. Satyadhyana Tirtha's purvashrama name was Korlahalli Sethuramacharya. His father Satyadhira Tirtha was 37th pontiff of Uttaradi Matha. Satyadhyana Tirtha had wide experience in the administration of the mutt, for many years as the diwan of the mutt. He was a shrewd judge of men and things. He had a keen sense of humour and had a ready way of putting everyone at ease with him. He was always accessible to students, scholars and those interested in philosophical problems. He appreciated Sāstraic learning wherever it was found, irrespective of sectarian affiliations. He had a knack of discovering hidden talent in the younger generation and inspired many young scholars who had taken University degrees in Sanskrit and Philosophy with a zest for research work in Vedanta. He championed the cause of Dvaita Vedanta for more than a quarter of century and made a deep and lasting impression on the world of traditional scholarship in Vedanta, by his tours and disputations and by his publications, distributed free all around. At the famous Dvaita- Advaita debate in Kumbakonam in 1929-30, he made history by engaging some of the veteran scholars of advaita headed by Anantha Krishna Shastri and forcing them all to retreat in despair. He engaged leading men of his day like Bal Gangadhar Tilak in philosophical debate; and founded a chair of Dvaita Vedanta and an endowment for the publication of Dvaita works written by North Indian authors, at the Benares Sanskrit College and edited Abhinavagada, Advaitakalanala, and other controversial classics. He gave sumptuous encouragement to scholars of all schools of thought and used to hold annual sabhas of scholars at Tirupati, and elsewhere, to examine and reward scholars in various branches of learning. He was foremost of the pontiffs of Hinduism. He travelled all over India many times, visiting great centers of traditional learning and places of religious importance like Benares, Gaya and Dwaraka in north and places in the south. He created a countrywide revival of interest on Madhva Siddhāntha and raised the prestige of the system in the estimation of the followers of other schools of Vedanta. He made a deep impression on the contemporary philosophical life, by his magnetic personality and by his untiring energy and drive. Satyadhyana Tirtha ruled the pontificate for 31 years. After his death on 24 March 1942, his mortal remains were enshrined in the mutt at Pandharpur in Maharashtra. He was succeeded by Satyaprajna Tirtha. Works Satyadhyana Tīrtha authored many works consisting of polemical tracts, commentaries on the works of Madhva and Jayatirtha. His Chandrikamandanam is a refutation of Ramasubba Shastri of Thiruvisanallur's critique of Tatparyachandrika of Vyasatirtha. =List of Notable works= The following are his notable works: Sanskrit *Gitasarasangraha *Gitapradhipadarthachadrika *Bheda Paranyeva Khalu Brahma Sutrani *Chandrikamandanam *Gita Vimarsha *Brahma Sutra Vimarsha *Advaita Branti Prakasha *Gita Lekhana Mala *Bhasma Dharana Nisheda tathaa Urdhvapundra Dharanam *Sudarshana Mahatmya Kannada *Sabhasara Sangraha Part I (civil suit), II and III *Geethopanyasagalu References Bibliography  * External links *Candrikāmaṇḍanam (Sanskrit) Category:Madhva religious leaders Category:Dvaita Category:Uttaradi Math Category:Indian male philosophers Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders ","title":"Satyadhyana Tirtha"},{"id":"61512283","text":"Scanlen is a surname.

The trajectories of the full system of a bailout embedding bail out—that is, detach—from the embedding, into a larger space, in which they move around. If, after some time these orbits arrive at a stable neighbourhood of the embedding, k(x) > 0, they collapse once more onto the embedding; that is, onto the original dynamics. The bailout embedding forms in this way an enlarged version of the dynamical system, one in which particular sets of orbits are cut from the asymptotic or limit set, while maintaining the dynamics of a different set of orbits—the wanted set—as attractors of the larger dynamical system. With a choice of k(x) = −(γ + ∇f), these dynamics are seen to detach from unstable regions such as saddle points in conservative systems. One important application of the bailout embedding concept is to divergence-free flows; the most important class of these are Hamiltonian systems.

Oviposition behavior  Oviposition behavior of Zatypota maculata toward its host spider, N. japonica, is highly adapted to a knockdown 3D web. Nihonhimea japonica constructs a characteristic web called the ‘knockdown 3D web’, which consists of a non‐viscid intricate 3D cobweb, a retreat made of a dead leaf at the center, and a dense non‐viscid sheet web at the bottom that serves as a capturing device (the video of the typical prey capturing behavior by the knockdown 3D web is available here). To cope with this specific web, Z. maculata has evolved two types of tactics; the one is creeping-style while the other is diving-style. The creeping-style is that the wasp climbs the 3D cobweb, creeps up slowly onto the spider's retreat, taking a long time so that the spider does not escape, and finally enters the retreat to sting the spider (the video of the typical creeping-style is available here). The diving-style is that the wasp dives from outside of the web onto the sheet, as a knocked-down prey item would, to lure the spider out, before stinging it at the moment of contact (the video of the typical diving-style is available here). 350x350px  References  Category:Ichneumonidae Category:Ichneumonidae stubs ","title":"Zatypota maculata"},{"id":"61512319","text":"Stoyko Gochev (born 12 January 1965) is a Bulgarian gymnast.

Additionally responsible for numerous thefts and three attempted murders, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, and is currently incarcerated in Kolonija Idrizovo. Early life Born in the Gjorče Petrov neighborhood, Karamarkov grew up with his mentally unstable mother, as his father had died when he was young. Although described as a loner, Viktor was regarded as a highly intelligent boy who finished his primary education with an excellent grade, and was very respectful of the elderly. He was also heavily indulged in various Russian literature, especially Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, identifying himself with the novel's main character, impoverished ex-student Rodion Raskolnikov. However, Karamarkov was also a known delinquent and drug addict, who frequently engaged in various thefts. Murders Taking inspiration from his favorite book, Karamarkov would search for vulnerable old ladies to commit his murders. When he found a suitable victim, he would ring on the doorbell and ask them for money, on the pretence that it was for his ailing mother. After entering the apartment, Viktor would take out a small axe wrapped in a newspaper and wrapped with tape, and subsequently kill the unsuspected victims, before robbing the apartment from gold jewelry in order to supply himself with more drugs. After each killing, he would visit the \\"St. Peter and Paul\\" Church in Gjorče Petrov, and ask for forgiveness. =Victims= * Ljubica Hristovska (83) - killed at her home in Butel, from a sustained head injury. When first investigated, police suspected that the killer was either from the family or the neighborhood, as there were no traces of violence, all items were in place and the door had been locked from the inside. * Bosilka Krasojevič (71) - killed on the same day as Bogoevska, October 15. Was attacked in her home on \\"October Revolution\\" Street, and later died from her sustained injuries. Authorities noted that this killing was very similar to Hristovska's murder. * Vera Bogoevska (76) - killed on the same day as Krasojevič, October 15. Was attacked in her home on \\"Franco Cluz\\" Street, and later died from her sustained injuries. * Elena Mileva (69) - killed on October 26, in her home on \\"Ho Chi Minh\\" Street. Karamarkov was arrested for theft shortly after her murder. =Attempted murders= * Marija Atanasovska (79) - a resident of Kapishtec, Atanasovska was assaulted by Karamarkov in the elevator, sustaining head injuries. He was about to leave her to bleed out, but was surprised by the victim's son-in-law, who was waiting for her at the exit. Confused to see a young man exit first, he asked what happened to the old woman, seeing that there was blood inside. Viktor explained that she had injured herself, and helped the son-in-law get her out of there, before promptly fleeing the scene. * Smilja Petrovska (73) - attacked on the same day as Sulejmani, October 21. Fought off her attacker from her \\"Railway Street\\" home. * Sanie Sulejmani (42) - attacked on the same day as Petrovska, October 21. A hygienist, Sulejmani managed to fight off Karamarkov from her home on Mavrovka Shopping Centre. Investigation, capture and sentence Although initially they didn't suspect a serial killer on the prowl, authorities gradually connected the dots by the crimes' similarity: old women, killed in their apartments with a blunt object to the back of the head. It was also noticed that all victims had gold jewelry missing. They contacted the surviving victims, who described their attacker as a young man who rings from door to door with a health book in his hands, seeking financial help for his mother. However, they couldn't describe him in great detail, as he appeared average and very unassuming. On October 27, Karamarkov was captured and given a 8-month long sentence for theft, but was witnesses and relatives of the attacked women identified him as the attacker. While searching his home, authorities located the axe used in the murders. Shortly after his face was shown on national television, many women came to identify him as the man who had stolen their jewelry. One woman, identified only as K. M., said that ten days before his arrest, he forcibly pulled off her gold chain while she walking near the Ministry of Culture. Distressed, a young woman chased after the perpetrator, but he managed to slip away. Shocked, his mother refused to believe that her son is a cold-blooded killer. Although he didn't confess to the killings, Karamarkov mentioned details that only the perpetrator would know. During his final statement to the court, Karamarkov claimed that he had been drugged while making his statements, and that he had been taken for three days at an unknown location. In there, a picture of Josip Broz Tito was hung on the wall, and he had not been provided a lawyer. Despite this, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, much to the dismay of his lawyer Sasho Dukovski, who claimed that there was no sufficient evidence for the verdict.

Career  In 1910, Macaskie had remained in the British protectorate of North Borneo after the First World War ended to work as a British government official. Between 1934 and 1945, he served as the Chief Justice and Deputy Governor of North Borneo. After the Japanese occupation of British Borneo, Macaskie returned and was appointed chief civil affairs officer for the period 1945-1946 and was later made commissioner for war damage claims for the Borneo Territories between 1947 and 1951. After he left North Borneo, Macaskie held the position of acting British judge at New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) in 1955, 1958 and 1959.  Personal life  Macaskie' first marriage was to Maggie Winifred Mary Macaskie (née Bruce), who bore him a son in 1919, Ian Bruce Macaskie. Due to Macaskie' frequent work travels into the interior region of Borneo, his family was often left alone in the capital Jesselton. In 1922, his wife fell pregnant with a Scottish man's child. Macaskie sent the family back to England to allow Maggie to give birth in more hospitable conditions and agreed to be listed as the child's father. Later, during one of Macaskie' trip back to Kent, the couple agreed to officially separate and eventually divorced in 1926. In 1946, Macaskie married Doris Cole-Adams (née Legg).

The raw storage capacities are 4.8 TB, 9.6 TB, 19.2 TB and 38.4 TB. The FlashCore modules support hardware self-encryption and real-time inline hardware data compression without performance impact. They are used in selected arrays from the IBM FlashSystem family.  History  RamSan-500 enterprise solid state disk from Texas Memory Systems On September 17, 2007, Texas Memory Systems (TMS) announced the RamSan-500, the world's first enterprise-class flash-based solid state disk. The Flash Modules were designed from the ground up by Texas Memory Systems using a proprietary form-factor, physical connectivity, ECC algorithm, and flash wear-leveling algorithm. The flash controllers used specialized logic that enabled lower latency than any other commodity controller could achieve. This product marked the beginning of development of the RamSan-OS, which was a custom designed flash management and storage infrastructure management suite implemented in both software and hardware. Six more generations of this flash controller were developed (for a total of seven generations), until IBM acquired TMS in 2012. On January 16, 2014, IBM announced the FlashSystem 840 product, which was the first FlashSystem designed entirely by IBM post-acquisition of TMS. IBM branded the flash controller technology IBM MicroLatency technology, and touted how the technology lowered data access times from milliseconds to microseconds. On February 19, 2015 IBM announced the FlashSystem 900 and V9000 products and re- branded the flash controller technology as IBM FlashCore technology, and described it as the suite of innovations and capabilities that can enable FlashSystem to help deliver better performance than enterprise disk systems. The flash modules themselves continued to be branded the IBM MicroLatency Modules. This version of the technology supported Micron's MLC flash chip technology. With the announcement of the FlashSystem 9100 on July 10, 2018, FlashCore technology was re-implemented into a standard 2 1/2 inch NVMe SSD form factor. This marks the first time that the original technology developed by TMS was packaged in such a way that conformed to an industry specification and was interchangeable with industry-standard SSDs.  Technology  IBM FlashCore utilizes FPGAs and NAND flash memory chips from off-the-shelf vendors to implement the entire data path is in hardware. Each Flash Module contains a gateway (implemented in an FPGA) and up to 8 flash controllers to efficiently distribute I/Os to the NAND flash chips. Firmware resides on a microprocessor and is only invoked for garbage collection management or when there is some problem than cannot be resolved by the hardware logic. The controller design for IBM FlashCore uses techniques such as health binning, heat segregation, read voltage shifting, and hard decision error correction codes to lower read and write amplification and to provide consistent low latency. In April 2017, IBM's flash portfolio represented more than 380 patents. The IBM FlashCore technology implements patented Variable-Stripe Raid (VSR) to increase the resiliency of stored user data.

It serves as the third single from Aplin's upcoming third studio album, Dear Happy (2020). Background On 8 August 2019, Aplin announced the release of her new single on social media. The song was produced by Lostboy and Mike Spencer. Talking about the song, Aplin said, \\"Losing Me is about what you wish you could hear when you're having a particularly hard time, while also being that voice to someone else who needs it. It's about remaining connected when there is so much in modern life that can give the illusion of oneness whilst making us feel more alone. I've been a huge fan of JP Cooper for years and I'm so happy he agreed to be on this song with me. I saw JP play an acoustic set at a festival three years ago I've wanted to work with him ever since.\\" Music video A music video to accompany the release of \\"Losing Me\\" was first released onto YouTube on 15 August 2019. Aplin said that the inspiration behind the video is how in the modern world, even when we're surrounded by people and things we can still feel desensitised and disconnected from everything going on.
