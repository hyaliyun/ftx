In everyday terms, functional verification attempts to answer the question \\"Does this proposed design do what is intended?\\" This is a complex task, and takes the majority of time and effort in most large electronic system design projects. Functional verification is a part of more encompassing design verification, which, besides functional verification, considers non-functional aspects like timing, layout and power. Functional verification is very difficult because of the sheer volume of possible test-cases that exist in even a simple design. Frequently there are more than 10^80 possible tests to comprehensively verify a design ‚Äì a number that is impossible to achieve in a lifetime. This effort is equivalent to program verification, and is NP-hard or even worse ‚Äì and no solution has been found that works well in all cases. However, it can be attacked by many methods. None of them are perfect, but each can be helpful in certain circumstances: *Logic simulation simulates the logic before it is built. *Simulation acceleration applies special purpose hardware to the logic simulation problem. *Emulation builds a version of system using programmable logic. This is expensive, and still much slower than the real hardware, but orders of magnitude faster than simulation. It can be used, for example, to boot the operating system on a processor. *Formal verification attempts to prove mathematically that certain requirements (also expressed formally) are met, or that certain undesired behaviors (such as deadlock) cannot occur. *Intelligent verification uses automation to adapt the testbench to changes in the register transfer level code. *HDL-specific versions of lint, and other heuristics, are used to find common problems. Simulation based verification (also called 'dynamic verification') is widely used to \\"simulate\\" the design, since this method scales up very easily. Stimulus is provided to exercise each line in the HDL code. A test-bench is built to functionally verify the design by providing meaningful scenarios to check that given certain input, the design performs to specification. A simulation environment is typically composed of several types of components: *The generator generates input vectors that are used to search for anomalies that exist between the intent (specifications) and the implementation (HDL Code). This type of generator utilizes an NP-complete type of SAT Solver that can be computationally expensive. Other types of generators include manually created vectors, Graph- Based generators (GBMs) proprietary generators. Modern generators create directed-random and random stimuli that are statistically driven to verify random parts of the design. The randomness is important to achieve a high distribution over the huge space of the available input stimuli. To this end, users of these generators intentionally under-specify the requirements for the generated tests. It is the role of the generator to randomly fill this gap. This mechanism allows the generator to create inputs that reveal bugs not being searched for directly by the user. Generators also bias the stimuli toward design corner cases to further stress the logic. Biasing and randomness serve different goals and there are tradeoffs between them, hence different generators have a different mix of these characteristics. Since the input for the design must be valid (legal) and many targets (such as biasing) should be maintained, many generators use the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) technique to solve the complex testing requirements. The legality of the design inputs and the biasing arsenal are modeled. The model-based generators use this model to produce the correct stimuli for the target design. *The drivers translate the stimuli produced by the generator into the actual inputs for the design under verification. Generators create inputs at a high level of abstraction, namely, as transactions or assembly language. The drivers convert this input into actual design inputs as defined in the specification of the design's interface. *The simulator produces the outputs of the design, based on the design's current state (the state of the flip-flops) and the injected inputs. The simulator has a description of the design net-list. This description is created by synthesizing the HDL to a low gate level net-list. *The monitor converts the state of the design and its outputs to a transaction abstraction level so it can be stored in a 'score-boards' database to be checked later on. *The checker validates that the contents of the 'score- boards' are legal. There are cases where the generator creates expected results, in addition to the inputs. In these cases, the checker must validate that the actual results match the expected ones. *The arbitration manager manages all the above components together. Different coverage metrics are defined to assess that the design has been adequately exercised. These include functional coverage (has every functionality of the design been exercised?), statement coverage (has each line of HDL been exercised?), and branch coverage (has each direction of every branch been exercised?).

The suit has been depicted in various ways, and the stories themselves have described Batman as modifying the details of his costume from time to time. However, it usually consists of a grey body suit, the chest emblazoned with a stylized black bat either with or without a yellow ellipse around it, and blue-black accessories: a wide scalloped cape, gloves with a series of fin-like projections, boots, and a close-fitting cowl (covering the upper half of his face) with ear-like projections to suggest a bat's head; and a utility belt containing a variety of gadgets. Batman's costume is used to conceal his identity, protect himself, and frighten criminals. Most versions of the Batsuit incorporate some form of body armor, powered exoskeleton, \\"wingsuit\\"-cape, built-in augmented reality computer, night-vision, gas filters, and other aids for protection or effectiveness in combat.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VROpJDhwJfE Origin and development =Origin= While brooding in his study over how to be a more effective crime fighter, Bruce Wayne saw a bat come through his window. Reflecting that \\"criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot,\\" Bruce adopts the persona of a bat in order to conceal his identity and strike fear into his adversaries. In the later elaborations on the origin, Bruce is terrified by bats as a child, and in the Silver Age story The First Batman (later retold in the 1980 miniseries The Untold Legend of the Batman) the inspiration for the batsuit comes in part from a bat costume worn to a costume ball by his father Dr. Thomas Wayne, M.D. =Color scheme= Batman's cape, cowl, gloves, briefs, and boots are usually either black or dark blue with the body of the costume being grey. Originally the suit was conceived as being black and grey, but due to coloring schemes of early comic books, the black was highlighted with blue. Hence, over the years the black cape and cowl appeared as dark blue in the comic books. Thus artists' renditions depict the costume as both black and grey or blue and grey. The bat symbol on the chest has also alternated from a simple black bat, to a bat design on a yellow ellipse, lending a logo-like appearance more akin to Superman's \\"S\\"-in-shield logo. The yellow ellipse was introduced in 1964 as part of the \\"New Look\\" Batman stories. In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, the yellow ellipse design was explained as being a heavily armored, intentional target, to draw enemy fire away from his unarmored head and body. A subsequent issue of Shadow of the Bat re- established the concept. The yellow ellipse was eventually removed in 2000 after a 36-year run and replaced by a large black bat-emblem, which resembles the one from the Golden age comics. Other elements, such as the utility belt and the length of the cowl's ears, have been changed by various artistic teams. =Basic suit= Bob Kane's original sketch of the character was very different from the Batman known today. Kane showed the very first drawing of a character he had first named the Bat, then Bat-Man, to Bill Finger who was the writer he hired to write the first Batman stories. Bill thought that the character looked too much like Superman, so he suggested major changes that would prove to be everlasting to the character's legacy. Finger took a Webster's Dictionary off the shelf, looking for a drawing of a bat, and found one. He then said to Kane, \\"Notice the ears, why don't we duplicate the ears?\\" He then suggested that Kane would draw what looked like a cowl, to bring the nosepiece down and make him look mysterious and not show any eyeballs at all. Finger didn't like the bird-like wings, so he also suggested to Kane to re- design them and make a cape instead, and scallop the edges so it would flow out behind Batman when he ran so it would look like bat wings as well as adding a bat symbol on the character's chest as its chest emblem. He also suggested that the color of his bodysuit should be gray instead of red and a pair of gloves were added, colored purple from the start but later changed to blue. Similar to many other superhero costumes, the Batsuit's basic foundation is a tight bodysuit. In early depictions, contrasting briefs were worn over a one-piece suit, similar to the garb of early 20th-century circus performers and strongmen. Batman #1 (June 1940) revealed that there is a bulletproof vest sewn into the costume. Modern depictions of Batman's suit do not incorporate contrasting briefs, and the character's suit consists of pants without a color change. The Batsuit is also no longer portrayed as a one-piece suit, as the top and pants are separate pieces. The Post-Crisis version of the bodysuit is not constructed from simple fabric, but from fictional advanced materials that gives it resistance to tearing. In addition, the suit also contains various defense and protection mechanisms layered into the suit's fabric. These protective layers in the Batsuit are necessary since Batman, although strong, powerful, and intelligent, is still a human being with no inherently superhuman powers. The basic version of the Batsuit is insulated against electricity and is mildly fire resistant. Batman utilizes many different body armor designs, some of which are constructed into his Batsuits, and others which are separate. In its most basic version, the suit is bulletproof around the upper torso and back. Other versions are entirely bulletproof to small arms fire, and have advanced flexible armor plating. In the video game, Batman: Arkham Asylum Batman wears a basic batsuit throughout the game but can unlock a new \\"Armored\\" batsuit after completing the main story-line. The armored suit is much bulkier and features heavy plate armor on the torso and limbs and segmented armor on the joints and neck. =Cape= Batman intimidates a mugger with his oversized cape displaying its scalloped edges. Art by Gary Frank (penciller), Mark Farmer (inker), and Danny Zozzo (colorist). As different artists have taken over the responsibility of drawing the costume, the details of the suit have changed considerably. The original incarnation of the cape was a wing-like structure that may have been inspired by drawings by Leonardo da Vinci. This eventually evolved into a more cape- like design of varying length with scalloped edges to resemble the wings of a bat. The material of the cape has varied with different writers, sometimes being depicted as bulletproofBatman Annual #15 (1991) and fire resistant, and other times being made of simple fabric that tears easily and is continuously replaced. For example, in the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Robin's Reckoning\\", Batman fell through a floor heavily compromised by machine-gun fire and landed badly, hurting his leg. He ripped up his cape and used some pieces of broken wood to make an impromptu ankle splint. He is also commonly seen with the cape able to wrap around his entire body, usually whenever he is standing or sometimes when walking. The cape may also incorporate Nomex fire- resistant/retardant material (as demonstrated in the film Batman Forever and the Knightfall novelization by Denny O'Neil) and a Kevlar weave to slow the impact of bullets. In The Dark Knight Strikes Again, the ends of the cape contained razor-sharp blades which Batman used to slice through several corrupt government officials. Batman's usage of the cape as a mode of transportation differed over the years. A hang-glider version of this concept was presented in Batman Returns, in which a harness folds out of the cape to make it a rigid wing-like structure, then folds back when the wearer rolls forward on the ground after landing. In the show Justice League Batman ejected from the Batplane with his cape acting as a parachute using a harness. In the 2005 film Batman Begins, the cape was also used as a sort of wingsuit; when an electric current was applied to the cape, the shape-memory fibers (much like Shape memory polymer) aligned into a semi-rigid form resembling a bat's wings, allowing Batman to glide over the streets and rooftops of Gotham. After Dick Grayson took over the identity of Batman, he and Damian Wayne, the new Robin and Bruce Wayne's biological son, developed a \\"para-cape\\" for their costumes which gives them an ability to glide.Batman & Robin #1 However, at the beginning, Grayson finds that the new cape has too much weight. The Batman Arkham series also gave Batman the same gliding ability as in Batman Begins. In the 2010 comic book mini-series Batman Beyond, Dick Grayson explains that there is also a tactical reason for adding a cape to the costume: misdirection. It \\"hides the body, makes it difficult to know where to strike\\" when Batman moves, with the result that villains attacking him at long range cannot determine whether they are shooting at Batman's body or just the cape. A flashback reveals that after armor-piercing rounds from the Joker's gun penetrated the cape, it saved Bruce but Dick, who was behind him, was critically wounded. It explains why Bruce eliminates the cape on the Batman Beyond incarnation of the Batsuit, as he'd rather be the one who got shot instead of others.Batman Beyond #4 (September 2010) =Cowl= Batman's cowl in Batman Eternal #2 (June 2014). Art by Jason Fabok. The cowl mainly conceals Batman's features and contributes to his imposing appearance. In almost all comic book depictions, the eyeballs are not visible through the cowl. This was suggested by Batman co-creator Bill Finger during the character's creation to give him a more mysterious look. Instead, the eyes appear white without any visible eyeballs. This motif of white eyes behind a mask has been replicated in nearly every masked superhero following Batman's debut in 1939.Kane, Andrae, p. 41. There may be something added to the cowl that alters how people see Batman when looking at him directly.\\"He's a tall guy. You can't see his eyes. And it's weird-- That cloak screws your mind up, like he's standing in a patch of darkness...\\" - from \\"Original Sins\\" by Neil Gaiman, first printed in Secret Origins Special #1: \\"Featuring Gotham City's Vilest Villains!\\" Batman's cowl has sometimes served other purposes. Occasionally, the cowl is depicted as having defense mechanisms such as electric shock or stun gas in order to prevent unauthorized removal (as shown in The Dark Knight, Batman: Hush, Superman/Batman, and Justice League of America #24).Batman: Hush comic book storylineSuperman/Batman: Public Enemies comic book storyline In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne mail orders the materials to build the cowl through a maze of untraceable shell companies. To avoid suspicion, Wayne orders very large quantities of 10,000, each part sent to different location, and under different aliases. However, because some superpowered individuals such as metahuman hitman Tommy Monaghan have the power to see through solid objects, Batman also lines the cowl with lead to protect his identity.Superman/Batman #9 That property is absent in The New Batman/Superman Adventures crossover \\"World's Finest\\", where Superman saw through Batman's cowl with ease. Batman's cowl has also been depicted with shifting optical lenses that identify suspect's identities, as well as their weak points (through medical records), while simultaneously avoiding the possibility of eye identification. The cowl's lenses incorporate multiple vision modes like infrared vision (heat sensors), night vision, and ultraviolet vision,Batman: Hush comic book storyline and a digital camera for obtaining evidences.Detective Comics #840 Also, in The Dark Knight, Batman uses a sonar concept (via Cellphone) introduced by Lucius Fox. This technology is utilized by using echolocation to triangulate objects via cell phones. In Detective Comics #838 (January 2008), it is revealed that Batman also has an echolocation system in the cowl. In Batman: The Animated Series, Batman wears a special motorcycle helmet when riding his Batcycle that is molded with bat ears to accommodate his cowl's ears. In Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman extensively uses a sophisticated \\"detective mode\\" vision enhancement built into the cowl that allows him to see enemies in darkness, including through walls, see their condition and state of alertness, and detect and identify hidden objects and analyze evidence. It also gives him the white eyes while it is activated. One of the cowl's ears carries a high-gain antenna for an internal communication device on the left side of the cowl, allowing Batman to stay in contact with his allies.Batman: Detective Comics #741 This communication device is capable of scanning police radios and other communication frequencies. It also carries an inertial navigation unit to keep him in balance when facing foes such as the Scarecrow or Count Vertigo.Batman #647 The cowl's Kevlar panels provide a level of protection for his head against firearms. The front of the skull and the sides of the temples also have small armor inserts to increase the effectiveness of skull strikes and protect from concussive blows. Repeated encounters with the Mad Hatter also forced Batman to shield his cowl against the villain's mind control. Its basic design has remained unchanged; however, it has been frequently updated for Batman's needs. Batman: The Brave and the Bold shows that the cowl's ears are able to change lengths for various uses in. However, artist Karl Kerchl has drawn Batman's costume vault showing that he has a wide selection of cowls with ears of different lengths.Adventures of Superman #643 Despite that, Dick Grayson's cowl supposedly has the same features as Bruce Wayne's, although Grayson often finds that wearing it interferes with his peripheral vision (although, as Grayson primarily wore a domino mask through his career, this could simply mean he is unused to the cowl). In Batman: Cacophony, during Batman's hunt with the masked serial killer Onomatopoeia, he reinforced one of his cowls with a secondary armor beneath its kevlar headpiece with bloodpack lining in anticipation of being shot in the skull, to create an opportunity to fake his own death to get himself closer to the villain. This was based on assassin Deadshot's helmet designs. =Gloves= One of Batman's gloves as they appear in Batman vol. 2, #23 (August 2013). Art by Greg Capullo. Batman is often depicted as wearing dark-colored gloves which extend to cover most of his forearms. In the earliest Batman stories of Detective Comics, the costume featured a few curiosities before it evolved in to its more or less standard style. The first gloves were purple in color, ordinary looking, and lacked any sort of scalloped fins or other stylings, and only came to the wrists. The second Batman adventure depicted the character wearing no gloves at all. A few issues later the gloves became longer, and by 1940 the familiar fins were added. In early stories, these fins originally resembled miniature, scalloped bat wings, but eventually became three simple triangular fins. In some later incarnations, the scallops are attached to a separated bracer worn below the glove around the wrist. In Batman Begins these bracers are part of the costume Wayne wore during his League of Shadows training, painted black ‚Äì this set are hard enough to slice Ra's al Ghul's sword into many pieces. The scallops typically serve a defensive purpose and are used to defend against bladed weapons, such as swords or knives. The gloves are sometimes depicted as being capable of launching the scallops as projectiles, most notably in The Dark Knight Trilogy, which also revealed electrical shockers in the fingertips of the gloves, used to control the structure of the wingsuit-style cape. Additionally, Batman hides a few pieces of his arsenal in his gloves, such as a lock pickRobin #14 and miniaturized batarangs.Batman vol. 1 #650 (April 2006). The knuckles of each glove have been depicted as containing a small amount of lead shot to increase the force of his blows. Similar knuckle reinforcement can be seen in the video game Batman: Arkham Asylum, where Batman actually sprays his knuckles with an explosive gel to drastically increase the force of a punch (shredding the glove and nearly breaking his arm in the process). In the 2004 series The Batman, Batman's gloves have sharp claws embedded in the fingertips. =Boots= In Batman: Year One, it is depicted that Batman hid a few pieces of his arsenal in his boots, such as a blowpipe (its length made it impossible to fit in Batman's belt compartment) with fast-acting anesthetic darts and (in the heel) an ultrasonic signalling device capable of calling live bats to it as a form of protection and cover (later reused in Batman Begins). The basic design of the boots are modeled on tactical boots, but they are made from lightweight rubbers and are much more flexible to allow for full extension when kicking. The bottom is a flexible split sole design and is textured for a variety of surfaces. The boots also have steel toes, making them much more effective when on the offensive. Although Batman is already an elite swimmer, during the Batman: Hush storyline, it is revealed that he installed underwater propellers in the heels. =Armor= Batman's new suit when starting Batman Inc. Art by Jason Fabok. The Batsuit has been repeatedly updated in order to reflect advances in technology. Originally the costume was a simple jumpsuit which contained no protective armor: however, the real world advent of various forms of personal protective materials like Kevlar and the realization that being shot while wearing such protection should still be avoided, has led to the costume being re-imagined with varying forms of bulletproof protection which employs the aforementioned use of the suit's chest symbol as a bull's-eye to lure shots at the armor's strongest point. Despite the armor, Batman almost always evades gunfire and is very rarely actually shot. In the 1989 film \\"Batman\\", the chest-plate is designed to look like a ripped upper body and one of the Joker's men shoots Batman nearly point-blank in the chest. In the film, numerous people shoot Batman in the chest. He falls over and \\"plays dead,\\" then jumps up and catches them off-guard. Although the suit often included a neck brace and other preventative bracing, after recovering from his spinal cord injury resulting from Bane's attack, Batman reinforced the armor with a spinal brace and a material to dampen shocks and impact to protect him from such attacks. The Batsuit also has a magnetic signature harness, allowing Batman to attract his body to a gargantuan metal object such as an airplane.Blackest Night: Batman #2 vol. 1 (November 2009) During The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul, Batman acquired an ancient suit of armor from Talia al Ghul, The Suit of Sorrows. According to its legends, it can impart strength and speed of its wearer but also would completely corrupt anyone whose heart and soul is not pure. At first, the Dark Knight was dubious of the legend, but eventually experienced an aggressive behavior while wearing the armor during patrols. Batman later learns from a member of The Order Of The Pure, a splinter faction of The Order Of St. Dumas, that the armor once belonged to a knight named Geoffrey de Cantonna, who massacred hundreds of people in an alpine valley in 1190. The Suit of Sorrows becomes one of the trophy displays within the Batcave, to remind the Dark Knight that he must be ever vigilant not only in his crusade against crime, but also himself.Detective Comics #842 The new Azrael takes up wearing the suit eventually. In all eight one-shots of Bruce Wayne: The Road Home, which sets after the events of Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne, show that Batman, acting as \\"The Insider\\", has developed an exosuit mimicking Amazo's capability of copying metahuman powers, includes Superman's heat vision, superspeed which is labelled with SF as in The Flash's Speed Force, Martian Manhunter's invisibility, emitting a Green Lantern's ring's energy, a lasso mirroring Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth, and superstrength. There is a design flaw on this suit: it uses too much power to keep it functioning. Thus, Batman must only use it for a limited amount of time. Lucius Fox also supplies Bruce Wayne and his son Damian a pair of experimental jetsuit prototypes. They can provide artificially enhanced strength and endurance as well as short-range flight capability. The prototypes are considered too risky and expensive for operational military use, allowing the Waynes to utilize them for the family's Batman Inc. project.Batman: The Return one-shot (Jan. 2011) =Utility belt and other equipment= Batman's suit with the black and yellow utility belt as it appears in Batman vol. 3, #12 (February 2017). Art by Mikel Jan√≠n. Batman's utility belt is his most characteristic prop, much like Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth, or Green Lantern's ring. The exact contents of this belt are not known because Batman usually changes it to suit his needs. His uncanny ability to carry unusually appropriate tools is legendary. Batman's enemies are especially interested in the utility belt as they believe it will give them an advantage over him, but the belt's compartments are locked and only Batman knows how to open them. There have been a few instances where the security has been bypassed: in the Justice League episode \\"Injustice for All\\", Lex Luthor managed to open the belt by subjecting it to intense electrical shocks and in an episode of The Batman \\"The Cat and the Bat\\" Catwoman stole Batman's utility belt and managed to open the capsules. The utility belt is depicted as having defense mechanisms such as electric shock, locks, marker paint, or stun gas in order to prevent tampering. The belt is almost always yellow in color, and the look of the belt is usually depicted as having either capsule-like cylinders or military style pouches to store his equipment in. Following 2016's DC Rebirth, Batman's utility belt is depicted as being a black and yellow flat, compartmentalized belt. The array of devices Batman carries have become more complex over time. The simple coiled rope and batarang scaling equipment became a rocket-powered (or compressed-air-powered) grapple gun.Miller, Frank. Batman #406. \\"Batman: Year One\\", DC Comics, 1987; and Batman vs. Predator #3 (1992) The suit has also carried on different occasions a re-breather device, flash and gas grenades, explosives and a detonator, lockpicks, a signaling device for the Batmobile, electronic surveillance equipment (including video camera and monitor), a forensic kit for gathering crime scene evidence, a medical kit, a small toolkit, a homing device, a cache of money and, in early incarnations, a pistol in a holster. On any occasion where Batman anticipates encountering Superman, he has also carried (in a lead case) a Kryptonite ring given to him by the Man of Steel as a weapon of last resort (in some instances, Batman has acquired ‚Äì or manufactured ‚Äì the kryptonite himself, such as Frank Miller's The Dark Knight graphic novels). One exception to this is seen in Kingdom Come, since in that novel, Superman has become impervious to kryptonite. In The Dark Knight Rises, at least one of the \\"pouches\\" has been replaced with a device previously seen being used by Bruce Wayne to avoid paparazzi attention that shuts off nearby electrical appliances. Variants in publication Batman keeps variant costumes for dealing with extraordinary situations; for example, he has been shown in a SCUBA variant of his costume, a fireproof version for fighting his enemy Firefly, a thermal insulated version for fighting Mr. Freeze, as well as others. Many versions of the hero, including those shown in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Kingdom Come, Batman Beyond and Batman versus Predator, show him swapping his cloth costume for a suit of powered armor, either to cope with particularly physically powerful foes or to compensate for his own aging body (In the Batman versus Predator series, Batman adopts a suit of armor to cope with serious physical injuries inflicted by the Predator in the first volume, and the third sees him using a new suit of armor designed to minimize his external body temperature to hide him from the Predator's infrared vision, although in the second volume he merely uses a scrambler gauntlet to disrupt the Predator's cloaking device as he prefers his usual stealth methods over the powerful but cumbersome armour). =Jean-Paul Valley= Jean-Paul Valley in his Batman armor. Art by the character's co-creator Joe Quesada. In the Knightfall story arc (1993‚Äì1994), the character Jean-Paul Valley redesigned the Batsuit during his tenure as Batman. Rather than appearing as a new costume, Jean-Paul developed it over time. Valley created an armored suit that contained more gadgets, including a shuriken launcher, flamethrower and other, more lethal weapons. This version of the suit did away with the traditional cape and cowl, and essentially an amalgam of Bruce Wayne's costume and Valley's Azrael armor. It featured armored and bladed wings and was highly bulletproof, capable of sustaining direct machine gun barrages as well as enduring the explosions from grenades and high intensity fire. The suit also featured an underwater rebreather. A circular ammo feeder affixed to the back of the suit provided Valley with continuous bat-shaped shuriken. It was then made to be more high tech, with the eyes appearing more as goggles, different color scheme, and more armor. After being caught in an explosion during his fight with the former Batman at the time, Bruce Wayne, the main color scheme turns into orange-and-yellow. While the suit bears immense power, it also slows its user's speed and limits movement capacity. In the end, the suit became Valley's vulnerable point, as Bruce realized that his replacement had become too reliant upon the suit's gadgetry. In their final confrontation, Bruce, in his traditional bat costume, tricked Valley into discarding the armor by leading him into a narrow tunnel that forced Valley to remove most of the armor to follow Bruce. Upon seeing Bruce revealed in his Batsuit under blinding daylight after being forced to remove his helmet ‚Äì the last part of the armour Valley had kept ‚Äì Valley's fragile mind collapsed, and he acknowledged Bruce as the true Batman. The gauntlets from this costume are now being used by Kate Spencer, the current Manhunter, who obtained them from an LAPD evidence room. They had been used by a small-time crook who unsuccessfully robbed the safe of a Gotham lawyer who keeps information on all his supervillain clients' loot. =Dick Grayson= In Batman: Prodigal after Bruce steps down as Batman after his recovery from his attack from Bane and the defeat of Jean-Paul Valley, Dick takes over the role of Batman and wears an exact duplicate of Bruce's Batsuit Rejected concept art by Tony Daniel showcased an outfit that was visually similar to the costume of Earth-Two's Dick Grayson. Another concept sketch by Frank Quitely depicted a plated design that heavily resembled the Batsuit worn by Bruce Wayne in the film The Dark Knight. =Troika= Batman's alternate costume in \\"Troika\\". Art by Graham Nolan. Though Batman rejects Jean Paul Valley's armor, he agrees that it is time to update his own Batsuit. While no different in terms of gadgets, the Batsuit that Batman wears, first in the Troika storyline, is noticeably darker than his previous costume, looking very similar to the suit worn in the 1989 Batman movie and its sequel, Batman Returns. The costume, made by Harold Allnut, is also much sturdier than his regular costume, as it is made of Kevlar and Nomex. Batman designs it with his encounter with Bane in mind, and thus is a prototype for additional protection against critical physical injuries such as spinal trauma along with standard firearms and intense heat. It cannot, however, able to withstand armor-piercing shells. Its matte black color scheme camouflages Batman against the city's environment at nights. The gauntlets and boots for this Batsuit are also one piece, connected seamlessly to the arms and legs. By Robin #14, Batman substitutes the original gloves and boots for ones of more protective quality, citing his encounter with the Russian Troika. Later in No Man's Land, Batman replaces the utility belt, which uses capsules, for a one with the standard military style pouches. =Batman, Inc.= After Bruce Wayne returns from his journey through time, he designs another Batsuit that differentiates from Dick Grayson's (concept drawings by artist David Finch) and adds further upgrades. It is notably similar to the Troika outfit, but unlike that Batsuit, this suit includes a full set of electronics, including a heating and cooling system, secure broadband communications,Batman & Robin: Batman Must Die Reprinted collection of Batman & Robin #13-16 page 165. and is capable of emitting an electromagnetic pulse, which disrupts electronic devices around him (such as rooftop security cameras).Red Robin #17 (Jan. 2011) For combat efficiency, Batman added projectiles on the gauntlets to incapacitate opponents, and retractable knives on the boots' soles. The shield is no longer just a bat- themed insignia adorned on the chest area. It can be used as a wide-beam flashlight and intimidating opponents, therefore could be \\"powered down to black or gray so that it camouflages itself when necessary.\\"Batman & Robin: Batman Must Die Reprinted collection of Batman & Robin #13-16 page 166. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Batman wore another version of the Batsuit designed by artist Jim Lee. This Batsuit was made of hardened plates on titanium-dipped tri-weave fibers and was broken into multiple pieces of armor over a more flexible bodysuit for greater mobility, similar to the one in the film The Dark Knight. The gloves were made of a dense but malleable leather with ribbing on the palm side of the fingers, raised piping, and convex metal knuckles on the topside. Mesh detail appeared just beneath the palm and inside the three recessed louver-like shapes located on both topside. The blades on the sides of Batman's gauntlets were retractable and capable of firing outward projectiles. The utility belt was a convex metal ampules form, and its buckle was made of beveled metal platelets. The back of the belt had an intricate containment device and could be detached to be used as a tool. Batman also adapted a para- cape that aerodynamically supported himself for gliding.Justice League vol. 2, #2 (Dec. 2011) =Justice Buster= When the Joker used a variation on his Joker toxin to turn the Justice League against Batman, Batman fought against them using a suit of armor described (by the Joker-like Superman) as the \\"Justice Buster\\" suit, created specifically for Batman to wage war against the most powerful beings on the planet. It allegedly cost more to create the suit than sixty percent of the world's nations put into their respective militaries, with a sizable portion of that budget going towards giving the suit the processing power necessary for it to outpace the Flash and anticipate where he would run so that it could immobilize him; even with the amount of focus on the Flash, Batman notes that the dedicated processing power is still based on the assumption that the Flash would not be moving at optimum speed when attacking him. Its armory includes an artifact called the \\"Bind of Veils\\", which is an inverted version of the Lasso of Truth that took Batman two years to acquire on the supernatural black market; contact with it traps Wonder Woman in a dream causing her to think she has killed Batman. More conventional weapons in the suit's arsenal include a foam-gun that sprayed powered magnesium carbonate to trap and drain Aquaman of all moisture, an electromagnetic nerve tree to stop Cyborg, a citrine neurotoxin for Green Lantern,Batman vol. 2, #35 plasma shields to deflect heat vision, dwarf red suns in the gauntlets to weaken Superman, and a small pellet of Kryptonite gum if Superman got past the suit. Despite the amount of time he put into creating the suit, Batman acknowledges that it would never be able to stop Superman if he was genuinely trying to kill the Dark Knight, only winning the fight with the Joker-like Superman through the use of the Kryptonite gum.Batman vol. 2, #36 =James Gordon= When James Gordon is 'promoted' to become a GCPD- sponsored Batman after the disappearance of the original, he wore two variations of the Batsuit, designed by the Powers Corporation. When he was in the field, he commonly wore a large high-tech suit of armor that included shoulder-mounted weapons, a large handheld gun, various electromagnetic generators, full-spectrum visual capabilities, and large bat-like wings to act as a bomb shield and refine its 'flight' mode ‚Äì although this was commonly used when falling from the GCPD 'Bat-Blimp' rather than full solo flight ‚Äì composed of nano-carbons that could even change color if the user wanted. When inside buildings, he wore a simple all-black bodysuit with a yellow bat outline on his chest while carrying a gun on a basic utility belt, lacking the usual cape, although the suit possessed a personal cloaking device that could turn Gordon totally invisible and was made of a material that could withstand the temperature of an incinerator long enough for Gordon to break out (even if it had to be repaired after the fire damage). When Gordon was acting alone, the robot Batsuit could run a 'nimble auto program' that would allow Gordon's home base to set a target and allow the suit to calculate how to reach that target, using basic contextual materials to act on its own accord. The suit proved powerful as a combat asset, and Powers Corp had plans to create a whole series of suits to be put into action across the country, but after the original sustained serious damage in battle with new villain Mr Bloom, who proceeded to take over all the other suits via remote control just before the original Batman returned, Gordon stepped back and returned to his role as Commissioner as Powers Corp abandoned the Batman program due to public loss of confidence, feeling that only the true Dark Knight could be Batman. DC Rebirth Batman's suit in DC Rebirth (2016). Art by Jim Lee, Scott Williams, and Alex Sinclair. In the 2016 DC Comics relaunch, DC Rebirth, Batman's latest suit is similar to his New 52 suit. It is mostly grey and black with a purple lined cape, like most of his other suits. The gauntlets and boots are armored, and the utility belt is black with yellow lining. The bat symbol is still black but now outlined in either gold or yellow, depending on the colorist. Elseworlds In The Dark Knight Returns, which Batman initially goes into action wearing the standard Batsuit, he dons a suit of powered armour when facing Superman. Features of this suit include an ultrasonic gun- along with sonic dampeners to prevent Batman being damaged by the same weapon- and the ability to plug directly into Gotham's power grid by connecting the suit to a lamp in Crime Alley. When plugged into the power grid, the suit was powerful enough to do some damage to Superman in a fight, but this required Batman to confront Superman at night after he had been hit with various other weapons, such as missiles from the Batmobile and an arrow of synthetic kryptonite. Three years later (The Dark Knight Strikes Again), Batman has returned to his original suit with a completely black cape and cowl, the cape's edges being so sharp that he is able to use them to carve a 'Z' onto Lex Luthor's face. During his initial rematch with Superman, after the Man of Steel had been worn down by various other attacks, Batman beat Superman into submission with a large pair of Kryptonian gauntlets. In Batman: In Darkest Knight, where Bruce Wayne is chosen as the Green Lantern instead of Hal Jordan, he mostly wears the standard Green Lantern uniform, but his attire includes a cape and cowl similar to what he would wear as Batman, although it lacks the \\"bat ears\\" of the traditional cowl. In Batman: Holy Terror, Bruce Wayne's costume is specifically stated as having originally been worn by his father when he portrayed a demon in a play. The general look is still the same as Batman's familiar attire, but the belt is almost triangular in design, the 'ears' on the cowl are wider without being a simple single point, and the bat-like symbol on the chest is more triangular, with a white patch at the top leading to a thin white line directly over the throat under the chin, possibly a reference to Bruce Wayne's civilian role as a priest. In Robin 3000, the Batman of this time period wears an outfit similar to the standard batsuit; the only clear difference is an artificial left eye, similar in design to Deadshot's familiar cybernetic substitute. In Batman/Houdini: The Devil's Workshop, most of Batman's attire is concealed under a long thick coat, the exact costume not entirely visible in the dark of the night, although his cowl is the familiar style apart from notably thinner 'ears' than usual. In Batman: Dark Knight of the Round Table, after Bruce of Waynesmoor has spent years living in Avalon before being trained by Merlin, he is granted a suit of armour that Merlin describes as having been forged by the power of the dragon, the metals forged by the dragon's fiery breath before being cooled in its blood, granting the wearer control over the forces of nature itself. While wearing this armour, Bruce also used his father's old sword. In Batman: Gotham by Gaslight and its sequel, the Batman outfit is presented with buccaneer- style gloves and boots and a floor-length cape with an upturned collar, along with a simple cloth cowl. The utility belt is shown with two short daggers and various pouches with unidentified contents. In Batman: Castle of the Bat, depicting Bruce Wayne as a Frankenstein-esque doctor while the Bat-Man is his reanimated father, the Bat-Man's initial attire is intended to aid in his father's altered awareness of his new senses and mask some of the necessary scarring, the familiar cowl accompanied by a short cloak around the shoulders and upper arms. As the Bat-Man 'evolves' he discards the cowl and his head becomes distinctly bat-like. In Kingdom Come and its sequel The Kingdom, an older Bruce wears a bracing powered exoskeleton due to his long career as Batman putting his body under serious strain, and then a completing armor when in action as Batman. In the Vampire Batman trilogy, Batman wears the familiar Batsuit even after he becomes a vampire, although he wields silver batarangs in the first novel in the trilogy in his final confrontation with Dracula and uses cross-shaped throwing daggers, made of wood with silver in the interior, in the second novel, these weapons specifically designed to help him kill the other vampires. After his surrender to his vampire side and several months decaying in a coffin, Batman occasionally transforms into a twisted giant bat form when flying and hunting his enemies, but he retains the usual suit in his human form, albeit with his body now so decayed that his ribs are clearly visible and his arms seemingly reduced to bones rather than skin and muscle. In Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat, some years after Bruce Wayne's death and humanity's decimation by a virus unleashed by Ra's al Ghul, Ra's takes control of the Batcave and uses some of Bruce's sketches of possible costumes to create an army of Bat-men based on Bruce's rejected costume designs. These costumes reflect darker or more heavily armoured styles that Bruce considered using before he decided to go with a simple design that could be adapted for multiple situations, feeling that others suffered such problems as impractically large capes, excess padding providing enhanced protection at the cost of mobility, or looking too demonic for his goal of becoming part of the darkness without appearing too intimidating for the people he was trying to protect. Later in the storyline, Talia is able to direct her son, Tallant, to oppose his grandfather, with Tallant donning his father's own Batsuit to infiltrate Ra's's plans and destroy his grandfather's army. In Elseworld's Finest‚Äîretelling the origins of Superman and Batman in the style of pulp fiction narratives in the 1930s‚ÄîBruce Wayne is a former playboy turned impoverished archaeologist. During a confrontation with Ra's al Ghul's men on a quest for the lost city of Argos, Wayne is badly injured by a poisoned sword, but is confronted by the spirit of the ancient warrior-wizard Kha. who offers Bruce life and himself redemption if Bruce will take on his mantle. Kha's armour consists of a black bodysuit with golden gauntlets and boots, as well as a golden necklace in the style of a bat and a golden helm that resembles a twisted bat. In League of Justice, depicting DC heroes in a fairy- tale realm, the 'Bat-Mancer' goes into action wearing armour underneath the head and wings of a giant bat. In Superman: Speeding Bullets, depicting a world where Kal-El was taken in by the Waynes and raised as Bruce, he initially goes into action wearing what appears to be the standard Batsuit, albeit with the mouth covered as well and visible padding around the edges of the arms and legs. After Lois Lane convinces him that he would have more power as a symbol in the daylight, he adopts a new Superman-style costume, albeit without the red 'trunks' and with headgear that encircles his ears and chin while leaving his face exposed. In Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl, where Barbara Gordon is Batgirl after her father was killed saving the Waynes and Bruce is essentially her Alfred rather than Batman, she initially wore the standard Batgirl costume from the comics. By the time of the storyline, she has adopted a darker costume, including metallic gauntlets on her forearms and wrists, shoulders, and exterior ankles, with the main suit consisting of nanites extending out from the belt to cover her body. In Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty, Bruce Wayne's distant ancestor Joshua of Wainwright initially acts as a member of the Knights Templar, but when faced with a raid on Vandal Savage's compound after the rest of his group have been slain by Savage's minions, he dons his old family armour, which includes a bat-like crest and a helmet in the style of the usual Bat-cowl, including small points and a visor that shields his eyes, although his equipment consists only of a sword and a short iron knife. In the present day, after Savage kills his parents on his wedding night, Bruce adopts the familiar Batman costume to hunt their killer, later adapting it into a spacesuit with its own air supply and the cowl now an actual helmet when he confronts Vandal on a space shuttle. In the twenty-fifth Century, Brenna Wayne devises three bat-themed costumes to track the source of the conspiracy against her family, with two being high-tech black-and-orange suits with such advanced weaponry as flamethrowers in the cape/wings, and the third a simpler black suit with gold trim. In Superman & Batman: Generations, depicting Superman and Batman 'aging' in real-time from their debuts in 1939 onwards, Bruce Wayne is shown wearing the standard Batsuit of each era, including wearing a Robin outfit in a story set in 1929 and wearing a fox-mask with an orange cape and purple shirt during an adventure when he was a child in 1919. Dick Grayson takes on the role of Batman between 1959 and 1969, again wearing a Batsuit similar to what was worn in the comics at this time, with this suit being worn by Bruce's son, Bruce Wayne Junior, when he takes over as Batman in 1969 after Grayson is killed by a trap set by the Joker, Bruce Junior switching costumes with Grayson to create the illusion that the Joker killed Robin rather than Batman. Between 1979 and 1989, Bruce Junior adopts an armoured Batsuit with a covered facial mask as his new costume. He wears this costume until 1999, when he rediscovers his long-missing father- Bruce Wayne having become immortal and young in 1979 after a confrontation with Ra's al Ghul- with Bruce adopting a new Batsuit in darker colours after his return to the role. In other media =Animation= Filmation and Hanna- Barbera In the various superhero animated series produced by Filmation and Hanna-Barbera, including The Adventures of Batman (1968‚Äì1977), Super Friends (1973‚Äì1986) and The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Batman has been consistently depicted with the blue and gray Batsuit of the Silver Age comics from the 1950s and 1960s, with the chest emblem and utility belt from the \\"New Look\\" version. DC animated universe Batman's various costumes in animated adaptations. Batman wears various Batsuits throughout the DC animated universe (DCAU): ;Batman: The Animated Series The Batsuit in Batman: The Animated Series (1992‚Äì1995) features a chest emblem and utility belt similar to the \\"New Look\\" version, and the emblem's design itself typically resembles the yellow-ellipsed bat symbol that was used in comics from the early 1970s through the late 1990s (as well as most Batman merchandise to this day and in the 1989 theatrical movie poster), but the cape and cowl noticeably feature Bob Kane's original color scheme of black with blue highlights. Occasionally, the cape and cowl appear to be woven in one piece, and when he is not fighting the cape is usually seen covering Batman's entire body below his head (similar to how he is occasionally drawn in the comics). His utility belt uses capsules or cylinders that are both yellow (similar to his utility belt drawn in the comics). The costume lacks any armor qualities and is merely a gray bodysuit with no apparent special features that often becomes torn in serious fights. It is occasionally seen packed in Bruce Wayne's luggage or in his vehicles, and it is made clear that he has numerous spares. It is also shown that he hides lock picks and blades within his gloves in preparation of when his wrists being bound by handcuffs or ropes. The exact appearance of the suit was not always consistent in the series, such as the chest emblem's design or the length of the cape. This design was re-used in the feature films Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993) and Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero (1998). ;The New Batman Adventures Batman's physical appearance was revamped in The New Batman Adventures (1997‚Äì1999) with his second major Batsuit's colors darker overall and the utility belt here uses pouches that is a very pale light brown. His gloves also have extended scallops and his chest emblem was changed into a complete bat without the yellow ellipse. There were fewer highlights on the cape and cowl that were now dark gray and the cape itself was redesigned to always reach over his shoulders, even when it is not covering his entire body below the head and the tights were also changed to a dark gray. Bruce Wayne's Batsuit resembles the batsuit used in Batman: Year One. This design was re- used in the crossovers with Superman: The Animated Series and Static Shock, as well as the feature film Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman (2003) and the flashback sequence in Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000). ;Justice League and Justice League Unlimited Batman was again redesigned in Justice League (2001‚Äì2004) with his third major Batsuit as a mixture appearance of the previous two designs; the costume itself is basically the same one from The New Batman Adventures, but has the original color scheme from Batman: The Animated Series. Additionally, the artists added certain modifications to foreshadow the futuristic costume from Batman Beyond such as the lengthening of the \\"ears\\" on the cowl from and the addition of heels on the boots. This design is re-used in the Static Shock two-part episode \\"A League of Their Own\\", as well as its follow-up, Justice League Unlimited (2004‚Äì2006). ;Batman Beyond An extremely different variant of the Batsuit is featured in Batman Beyond (1999‚Äì2001) which does away with the traditional individual articles of clothing and appears to be a simple black bodysuit with a red chest emblem and the cowl also covers the entire face: however, this version is a form-fitting \\"power suit\\". This fourth major Batsuit was originally designed by Bruce Wayne himself to aid his aging body (as the series' storyline was set at the DCAU's chronological end), but Terry McGinnis becomes the suit's primary wearer once Wayne retires. This Batsuit is unlike any other one in the DCAU. It gave Terry increased strength and equipped with sophisticated built-in gadgets (similar to Jean Paul Valley's variant). Of its many features, the most frequently used are a set of retractable wings and jet boots which together allow for flight, an active camouflage system which renders him nearly invisible, and a two-way radio and video link system that allows Bruce to see and hear everything Terry does and give advice and communicate. The suit features microphone recorders in the fingertips permitting eavesdropping and recording conversations either from a distance or through a wall. His signature weapon the batarang is now stored in a magazine. An automatic launcher built in the wrists places one or multiple foldable circle shaped batarangs for instant throwing (the suit most likely has a ballistics computer for calculating trajectories for throwing as shown when Terry attempted to throw a batarang while not wearing the suit and missed). The suit is flexible enough to be folded and stored in a backpack. It offers mild ballistic protection, flame resistance, radiation resistance (albeit not for prolonged exposure), is durable enough to offer the wearer resistance to blunt force trauma or significant impact (allowing the wearer to withstand punches from beings with super strength). Its original utility belt was capsulized like the original design from Batman: The Animated Series. It is also revealed that some of the suit's technology (notably the servomotors in the limbs) was designed by prosthesis scientist Dr. Peter Corso. Repeated encounters with Inque led Bruce to add electroshock circuitry to protect Terry or to disable an opponent. This Batsuit design was re-used in the feature film Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000) as well as the crossover The Zeta Project and even post-series crossovers Static Shock and Justice League Unlimited. In the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\" (set during the Batman Beyond era), minor changes show Terry has more traditional pouches like the designs from The New Batman Adventures and Justice League. ;Other DCAU costumes Flashbacks from the Batman: The Animated Series episodes \\"Robin's Reckoning\\" and \\"The Mechanic\\" as well as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993) show Batman's earliest costume that (according to the reference book Batman Animated) was based on the Batsuit from Batman: Year One with elements from Bob Kane's original Batsuit (which was also similar to how his basic costume would be designed in all further subsequent DCAU appearances). Batman also has an alternative suit of black armor in The New Batman Adventures episode \\"Torch Song\\" capable to withstand extreme heat and flame (such as Firefly's attacks) and presumably bulletproof as well. During the alternative timeline created by Vandal Savage's disruptions of World War II in the Justice League episode \\"The Savage Time\\", Batman's Batsuit reflected the state of war he lived under: a helmet (with seemingly no eyes but likely has a visor), several rigid armor plates and incorporates firearms into his arsenal (unlike in the primary timeline). Another alternative-universe version of the Batsuit worn by the Justice Lords incarnation of Batman in the Justice League episode \\"A Better World\\" featured lighter gray colors on the cape, cowl and chest, and jet black on the rest of the bodysuit, seemingly inspired by the Phantasm costume worn by Andrea Beaumont. The cape was also extended to cover the upper torso and shoulders entirely, with the Bat insignia embedded into the chest portion. The insignia itself was also changed to become more angular, and was colored a metallic silver, a version of the same logo appears on the Batman Beyond era Batsuit. The Justice Lord Batsuit also did not use separate colors for the \\"underwear\\" portion, had a silver-gray utility belt, and the gauntlets had no scallops. In the Batman Beyond episode \\"Disappearing Inque\\", Bruce Wayne had a prototype Batsuit that resemble the Bat-Armor from DC Comics's award-winning comic book epic Kingdom Come which he used to fight Inque. This Batsuit can increase Bruce's endurance and offer him some protection, but hindering his movements due to its colossal size and puts a strain on his weakened heart. It lacks a scalloped cape or wings, indicating that Bruce was not finished of building it prior to him went to retirement. The Batman In The Batman (2004‚Äì2008), the Batsuit looks very similar to the costume from Batman: The Animated Series, but has shorter 'ears' on the cowl to make the Batman look more like a \\"boxer\\", claws on the fingertips of the gloves, a slightly redesigned yellow-ellipse bat emblem on his chest, a more high-tech computerized utility belt linking to the Batcave's computer system called the \\"Batwave\\"; The belt's buckle can be removed and used for several purposes, such as for a tracking device, for controlling the Batmobile, the Batbot, or as seen in \\"The Cat and the Bat\\" fly remote-controlled batarangs. It also has a longer cape that, just like the DCAU costumes, sometimes covers his entire body below the head. In the episode \\"Fleurs Du Mal\\", it is shown that the suit is linked to the Batwave, to monitor his physical and mental activities. Despite this regular default Batsuit, Batman uses some other variations of the Batsuit as well in the series to tackle certain situations and villains. * In the episode \\"Traction\\", the Batman is badly injured by the immensely powerful Bane, due to which he is forced to build a prototype exo-skeleton called the \\"Batbot\\" to battle the villain. The Batbot is controlled by Bruce Wayne while sitting inside its cockpit. It is shown to possess superhuman strength to match that of Bane, along with enhanced levels of agility and endurance. It has two turbo retro-thrusters for flight on its back as well. The Batbot is also shown to be controlled via the Batman's utility belt (for example, in \\"The Cat and the Bat\\" episode). * In the episode \\"The Big Chill\\", when Mr. Freeze defeats the Batman in their first encounter, the latter's butler Alfred coats the Batsuit with a special white weather-proof material, that can withstand sub-zero temperatures and can be used by the Batman to camouflage himself in snow. It covers the Batman's facial part as well, which is usually the only exposed part of his regular Batsuit. Additionally, this arctic Batsuit is shown to be armed with retractable ice skates in the boots and two flamethrowers attached on either side of the waist. Also, the blades on the Batman's gloves emit high electric sparks to melt any ice in his path. The arctic Batsuit reappears in the episode \\"Fire and Ice\\", and is depicted to sustain heavy amounts of damage but protects its wearer, when the villain Firefly maneuvers the Batman into a fuel tanker that is about to explode. The Batman survives, but injures himself and has the suit damaged. * In the episode \\"Swamped\\", when the Batman has to battle Killer Croc, he uses a special hydro Batsuit, that does not get wet or allow water to enter it. It is totally black in color, and the Batman somehow sheds or retracts his cape in his suit when he goes underwater to battle Killer Croc. *In the movie The Batman vs. Dracula (2005), Batman briefly extended the design of his utility belt to his shoulders and chest for carrying a vast number of vampire-fighting gadgetry such as garlic bombs, garlic-treated batarangs, and vials of vaccine made to counteract a vampiric virus spread from the vampire lord Count Vlad Dracula. The extension of the belt would also create a shape of a cross, which is commonly known to be able to ward off vampires as they have an aversion to all of the Christianity icons, including Christian crosses. * With arsonist Garfield Lynns' transformation from Firefly to a nuclear-powered Phosphorus in \\"White Heat\\", Batman designed a black NBC suit, built by Alfred, to protect himself. * On the episode \\"Artifacts\\", it is shown that, decades into the future, an elder Batman would adapt a simpler Batsuit resembling of Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel. Batman: Gotham Knight In Batman: Gotham Knight (2008), a DC Universe Animated Original Movie set between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, details of the Batsuit are shown. The suit has many characteristics of the Batman Begins suit, but on the segment \\"Field Test\\", Batman upgrades the suit with an advanced motion scanner that has an electromagnetic gyro which produces a magnetic shield capable to deflect small-arms fire before he abandons it because of the danger to bystanders of its random deflections. On \\"In Darkness Dwells\\", it is shown that there's an infrared scope built within the cowl, along with a rebreather that can be folded within it. There's a wireless relay communicator in the cowl. Its signals are locked with quantum cryptology and bounced through a dozen different satellites (presumably the WayneComs). As per the animation styles the suit varies between versions of the Batman Begins costume and the Comic Book costumes, including the similarity to the outfits from The New Batman Adventures and Justice League. Batman: The Brave and the Bold In Batman: The Brave and the Bold (2008‚Äì2011), Batman wears a slightly modified version of the blue and gray suit worn during the Silver Age comics from the 1960s and 1970s. The batsuit also resembles the \\"New Look\\" costume. According to the show's creators, this was deliberately done to invoke a less dark and violent depiction of Batman following the release of The Dark Knight. Though similar in appearance to the older costumes, this Batsuit is unique in that it possesses a much larger amount of gadgetry than any other costume shown to date, and has many characteristics of the Batsuit in Batman Beyond. Thus far, this version has been shown to not only contain multiple Batarangs and other standard Bat-paraphernalia, but also a collapsible sword (hidden inside his utility belt with a sound similar to a lightsaber), wings, deep space gear, scuba equipment, and multiple rocket thrusters. Also, the emblem on Batman's chest can now transform into an emergency Batarang, becoming hard and rigid after being exposed to some sort of magnetic field emitted by the suit. Also, the 'ears' on the mask can become long blades with the push of a button, sharp enough to pierce a robot's head. In the episode \\"Game Over for Owlman\\", Owlman steals one of Batman's costumes that looks identical to the original Detective Comics #27 design from 1939, and commits a series of crimes to frame the Caped Crusader. In a flashback sequence from the episode \\"The Color of Revenge\\", Batman is shown wearing a slightly different costume that has the chest emblem from the Golden Age comics from the 1930s and 1940s, in addition the episode's teaser has Batman sporting various Bat suits in different colors, as an homage to Detective Comics #241. In another flashback during \\"The Golden Age of Justice\\", a much younger Batman is shown wearing the original Bob Kane outfit during training sessions with the Justice Society. Young Justice The Batsuit worn by Batman in Young Justice (2010‚Äì2013) is largely similar to the ones seen in The New Batman Adventures, Justice League, and Justice League Unlimited, as well as the comic books prior to Batman Incorporated. The only major visual difference stems from the detailing on the suit, which highlights the padding and armored plates, in contrast to the more minimalist take drawn by Bruce Timm and other artists. In the episode \\"Schooled\\", Bruce is shown utilizing an emergency Batsuit hidden in the Metropolis corporate offices of Waynetech. As a nod to the 60's Batman series, the suit is accessed via a switch concealed within a bust of William Shakespeare. Beware the Batman Taking advantage of the computer generated imagery used to create the show, the Batsuit worn in Beware the Batman is more detailed than previous versions. Like the suits seen in most of the live-action films, the new Batsuit is entirely black and sports a raised bat-emblem on the chest without the yellow-ellipse, as well as a more helmet- like cowl, and it is very similar to the outfits from The New Batman Adventures, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. The suit's utility belt was also redesigned for the show, and an actual model was built by Glen Murakami in order to make it as realistic and practical as possible. The Lego Movie In The Lego Movie (2014), the Batsuit Batman wears resembles the one from Tim Burton's live action movies as well as the Batman comics from the 90s. The Lego Batman Movie In The Lego Batman Movie (2017), Batman wears the same Batsuit from the previous movie but now has a new belt piece and has glowing eyes like they did in Dawn of Justice. Batman also owns hundreds of types of Batsuits such as the ones seen from his first appearance in the comics, the 1960s version, the armored version from Dawn of Justice, the 1943 serial and Batman Beyond. Other Batsuits are briefly seen such as Suba Bat, Glam Bat, Regge Man (which becomes the Robin costume), Nightwing, Com-Bat, St Batricks, etc. Batman: The Killing Joke In Batman: The Killing Joke (2016), Batman's Batsuit resembles the one used in Batman: Year One and its comic counterpart. Batman TV show, worn by the late Adam West =Live-action= 1940s movie serials The movie serials of the 1940s featured a black and gray version of the Batsuit and it resembles the one from the early Batman comics. 1960s TV series The live-action Batman television series of the 1960s, starring Adam West, featured a blue-purple and gray version of the Batsuit with the cape shortened (to avoid West and stunt doubles getting tripped up) and smaller ears on the cowl (for closer shots during filming). There were also light blue eyebrows painted on the navy blue face plate, along with a light blue-line on the nose. The rest of the cowl was blue satin fabric that would turn purple after hours of filming under the hot studio lights. 1989-1997 film series ;Batman (1989 film) Tim Burton's Batman films feature a matte-black Batsuit with the yellow-ellipsed bat emblem, brass utility belt, and heavy armor placed on the chest, forearms and boots, with the chest plate sculpted to look like a well developed upper body. This becomes the basic template on which all subsequent live-action Batsuits are based. On several occasions in the live-action films, Bruce Wayne's appearance in this Batsuit template has been likened to that of \\"A giant bat,\\" especially when his cape is spread wide in front of terrified criminals. Batman film, worn by Michael Keaton In Batman (1989), the basic design of the suit, by Bob Ringwood, is essentially the Neal Adams version of the costume, which was still in vogue in the comics during the 1980s. This movie suit was notable for its introduction of the grapple gun with a motorized reel (which was later adopted by the comics), for the black eye makeup worn under the mask (which has been used in every live-action Batman film since), and for the construction of the cowl (which made it nearly impossible for Michael Keaton to turn his head while wearing it). The costume was constructed of black kevlar-like material over metal plating (foam latex in reality, hi-tech body armor in the context of the film), instead of the light-gray spandex seen in the comics and in the 1966 live-action Batman television series. Keaton was told not to put on too much muscle in preparation for the role, as there was uncertainty to how it effect the costume they were sculpting on bodycasts made during the filming of The Dream Team. Keaton's lean build proved helpful when adding layers of armor to his silhouette with the bodysuit. ;Batman Returns In Batman Returns (1992), Bruce is seen choosing his Batsuit and accessories out of many spares from a large walk-in closet carved into a wall of the Batcave. The suit used in this film differs slightly from the previous version, being that it was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam latex material and featured more angular shapes in its representation of anatomy. The overall design of the suit was meant to reminiscent of art deco and industrial design like the rest of his retro-futurisic gadgetry. It also features a chest emblem more similar to a traditional bat symbol seen in the comics and in Batman: The Animated Series, than the previous film's costume. At one point in the film, Batman's cape is shown to be able to change, through use of a fold-out spring- loaded framework, into a glider that allows him to glide through the sky. Christopher Nolan would use a similar approach with the cape in his Batman films. Michael Keaton insisted on making the costume's groin area easily allow him to urinate between takes, which resulted in new seam lines running down the leg and a groin flap hiding a zipper on the slacks. ;Batman Forever Joel Schumacher's Batman films are known for their addition of rubber nipples to the Batman and Robin costumes (on the DVD commentary, Schumacher claimed they were inspired by statues of the Greek gods), though they are noticeably absent from the secondary suits Batman wears during the climaxes of both films. In Batman Forever (1995), the Batsuit is somewhat similar to the previous two films' costumes, except for the focus on a more anatomical design overall and a black utility belt instead of a yellow one. The \\"ears\\" on the cowl are also longer. One notable feature of the costume is a button on the utility belt which causes a fireproof coating to excrete from and cover the cape, allowing Batman to wrap it around himself as a shield from extreme fires, and a more 3-D bat emblem on his chest, but resembles the chest symbol from Batman Returns. Also like in Batman Returns, Bruce has numerous spares which he keeps in a large dome-like structure in the Batcave of this film. Dr. Chase Meridian, the film's love interest for Batman, mentions the appeal of Batman's suit as she runs her fingers across the chest section. After all of the regular Batsuits are destroyed by the Riddler, Bruce wears a prototype \\"Sonar Suit\\", which is an iridescent silvery-black and more armor-like. This new Batsuit utilizes lenses that slide automatically over the cowl's eyeholes to display a sonar-generated image of Batman's surroundings to him, allowing him to see with more accuracy in extreme darkness or glare. The use of this suit in the climax of the film, allows Batman to smash the Riddler's Box-device and save both Robin and Dr Meridian, which otherwise would have been impossible with the standard Batsuit. The Batsuits in this film were created from a less dense mixture of foam rubber, which resulted in much lighter suits and allowed more flexibility for Val Kilmer and the various stunt doubles, while increasing durability. More than 100 Batman and Robin costumes were created to allow for the range of stunts, from underwater scenes to scenes involving fire and extreme fighting. The \\"sonar\\" Batsuit was subsequently used by Christopher Nolan when auditioning actors for the lead role in Batman Begins, and was worn by Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy among others. ;Batman & Robin In Batman & Robin (1997), Batman produces a bat-credit card from his utility belt which has an expiration date of \\"Forever\\". This film also added pop-out ice skates to the costume's boots. The basic Batsuit of this film is also noticeably more blue than black in color tone, including the ellipse around the bat symbol instead of the yellow ellipsed bat symbol from the last three films. A second, more elaborately detailed costume (a silvery Arctic version) is worn by \\"Batman\\" during the film's climax against Mr. Freeze, which is identical to the prototype \\"Sonar Suit\\" from Batman Forever, but in blue with silver accents. As in Batman Forever, the basic Batsuit of this film also features nipples and an enlarged codpiece. While Bruce is giving Alfred his medicine, he wears the same prototype \\"Sonar Suit\\" from Batman Forever, minus the cowl and gloves. The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012) ;Batman Begins The Batsuit in the reboot Batman Begins (2005) is given the most complete description ever seen in a Batman film and the comic books. Derived from the Research and Development Program within Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences Division, the suit is described by Lucius Fox as a Nomex survival suit originally intended for advanced military use but was considered to be too expensive for the United States Army and military in general. Based on an advanced infantry armor system constructed from Nomex, the first layer of protection is an undersuit with built-in temperature regulators designed to keep the wearer at a comfortable temperature in almost any condition. The second layer of protection consists of armor built over the chest, calves, thighs, arms and back. This armor features a kevlar bi-weave that can stop slashing weapons and can also deflect any bullet short of a straight shot impact, and reinforced joints that supposedly allow maximum flexibility and mobility, which Batman finds still hinders his movements due to its weight. The armor is then coated with a black latex material for camouflage and to dampen Bruce's heat signature, making him difficult to detect with night- vision equipment. Made of a graphite material, the cowl acts as a protective helmet. The cowl's Kevlar lining is supposed to be bulletproof. A manufacturing defect in the graphite used in the production of the first shipment of the cowl's components made its outer shell incapable of withstanding blunt trauma (a flaw Alfred demonstrates to Bruce using a baseball bat). The second shipment (not shown) was supposed to fix this problem. An advanced eavesdropping device is concealed within the cowl's right ear and enables Batman to listen in on conversations from a distance. The utility belt is a modified climbing harness in bronze with the chest and shoulder straps removed for ease of movement. It features magnetized impact- resistant pouches and canisters attached to the belt at ergonomic points for ease of reach. It carries a magnetic gas-powered grapple gun, an encrypted cell phone, bat-shaped shuriken, a medical kit, smoke bombs, mini explosives, periscope, remote control for the Tumbler, mini-cam, money and other unspecified equipment. Batman's cape is made of \\"memory cloth\\" also developed by Fox. It is essentially flexible in its normal state, but becomes semi-rigid in a fixed form (Batman's wings) when an electric current is passed through it from the microcircuits in the palms of his gloves. Bruce also adds metal gauntlets with scallops on the forearms, an innovation derived from his experience as a pupil of Ra's al Ghul's League of Shadows. Mainly used to block against knives or other stabbing weapons, Bruce managed to surprise Ra's by breaking the blade of his ninjat≈ç in multiple places with the gauntlets. The left boot heel contains a high frequency sonic \\"sounder\\" which can summon bats (first seen in Batman: Year One). Prior to the latest upgrade to the Batsuit in the next film, Batman still uses the original less flexible Nomex based suit. Interrupting a drug transaction between Scarecrow and Chechen, he uses a pneumatic mangler that allows him to bend a gun barrel and tear through the sheet metal of a van while chasing after Scarecrow. ;The Dark Knight Batman's Batsuit is changed in The Dark Knight (2008) due to Bruce Wayne's growing frustration over his overall lack of mobility (leading to an incident where he gets mauled by dogs while breaking up a drug deal). In this new design, the bodysuit is made of hardened kevlar plates on titanium-dipped tri- weave fibers and is broken into multiple pieces of armor over a more flexible bodysuit for greater mobility. But as a trade-off, the flexible armor leaves Batman more vulnerable to injury from knives and gunfire in favor of increased flexibility and lighter weight. While the cowl of the Batsuit in previous film incarnations has been attached to the shoulder and neck, the Batsuit's cowl is now a separate component inspired by the design of motorcycle helmets, allowing the wearer to freely swivel and move his neck without moving the rest of his upper torso (by Bruce's personal request to Fox as 'it would make backing out of the driveway easier') as was characteristic in all the previous cinematic versions of the Batsuit. Also, a strong electric current runs through it that prevents anyone except Batman from removing it, to further protect his identity. In this Batsuit, the iconic blades on the sides of Batman's gauntlets are now retractable and are capable of firing outwards as projectiles. The bat emblem is smaller than the previous one and it bears a greater resemblance to the Batman logo that has been associated with the rebooted film franchise. The suit again has an external 'memory cloth' cape, but, now has the ability to fold into a backpack shape as demonstrated during the base-jump in Hong Kong. It is unclear in the film if once deployed, as a glider, it can return to this backpack shape automatically. According to costume designer Linda Hemming this backpack idea was developed, at the request of Christopher Nolan, as a fall back if the cape were to get caught up in the rear wheel of the Batpod in motion. However, the concept was not used in the Batpod sequences after the film crew realized they had failed to account for the motion of the Batpod blowing the cape behind the rider, keeping it free from the rear wheel. One notable modification was made to the utility belt; an air-powered charge-firing rifle, which allows Batman to fire timed explosive charges from considerable distances and can be folded into two halves into a box-like shape to fit into his utility belt's compartment. The Batsuit also has \\"sonar-vision\\", where signals emitted by mobile phones are converted into images in a similar way to echolocation, in which bats use sound to see. In order to view the images, lenses fold down from Batman's cowl to cover his eyes. Aesthetically this gives Batman, for the first time on film, the 'white eyed' appearance he is always depicted within the comic books and various animated films/TV series. ;The Dark Knight Rises This exact same costume is re-used in The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Batman initially also makes use of a motorized brace to support his damaged knee after injuries he sustained in The Dark Knight. During Batman's first fight with Bane, the costume is initially damaged when Bane severely beats Batman and tears off part of the cowl after cracking the graphite. The rest of the costume is disposed of by Bane's henchmen after carrying off Bruce's badly injured body, as he is shown wearing ordinary rags when imprisoned in the Pit. After he escapes from the prison, Batman is able to acquire an identical Batsuit from the underground bunker (the same one he used as an interim batcave while Wayne Manor was under reconstruction in the previous film). DC Extended Universe ;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Michael Wilkinson designed the costumes for Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Director Zack Snyder tweeted a photo of the first Batsuit for the film on May 13, 2014. It is influenced by the Batsuit seen in The Dark Knight Returns, and is noted by Bruce and Alfred to include additional armor to compensate for Bruce's greater age, as well as a device in the cowl to alter Bruce's voice when in the suit. The Batsuit is made of a Kevlar-titanium weave, is highly durable, making it resistant to knives and low-caliber firearms, the cowl and neck area of the suit consists of fabric-coated titanium alloy plating, protecting his neck and head from blade injuries and small caliber firearms (a man using a knife could only cause sparks to fly when trying to stab Batman in the back of the neck). Not even bullets can pierce the suit at point-blank range, but some areas are somewhat vulnerable as a thug is successfully able to stab Batman with a knife in the upper arm. A second Batsuit was unveiled at ComicCon 2014, and unlike the first which is made of cloth, it is armored and features illuminated white eyes.Collura, Scott. (July 26, 2014). \\"SDCC 2014: Wonder Woman Costume, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice Teaser Revealed\\" IGN In the film, Batman's armor is a powered exoskeleton built by him and Alfred Pennyworth to counter Superman's strength as well as to protect Batman from Superman's attacks. It is also armed with a grenade launcher to fire kryptonite gas grenades and a kryptonite spear, both of which are necessary to weaken Superman to the point where Batman can fight him directly. The armor is damaged in the fight with Superman, prompting Batman to return to his usual costume when he departs to save Martha Kent from her abductors. ;Suicide Squad In Suicide Squad (2016), Bruce wore the Batsuit again twice in the film where he captured Deadshot and Harley Quinn. ;Justice League In Justice League (2017), due to Bruce's paranoia of attack, the Batsuit has several additional pieces of armour, most notably on the arm and biceps. The cowl is more elongated, and the suit overall is lighter in texture. In the final battle at the climax, Bruce dons the Tactical Batsuit. This Batsuit consist of titanium armoured plates over a fireproof skin suit. The cowl also features small armoured plates on the ears, and Bruce also wears goggles, similar to Nite Owl from the Watchmen franchise.  Gotham TV series  In this prequel series Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman begins at the end of season 3, when he saves a nuclear family from the armed robber. His first ‚Äúproto-Batsuit‚Äù, shown in this episode, consists of black coat, black sweater, black gloves and simple robber-like black mask with triangle-shaped eyes. At the start of season 4 Bruce uses the same suit, but with slightly different mask and a hood added to the coat. But at the end of this episode Lucius Fox represents Bruce a new bulletproof suit with a plastic mask, which looks like a cut-off facial part of Batman's cowl. Bruce continues to use this suit throughout this and next season, while Fox invents new gadgets for him to use in combat. The only actual batsuit appeared in the final episode, based heavily on Christian Bale's suit, barring a rougher formed version of the cowl and 3D version of the Bat-symbol (similar to the costume from Batman Forever). Titans The Batsuit appears in the season finale of Titans, titled \\"Dick Grayson\\", in a dream world created by Trigon.  Batwoman In the television series Batwoman, the Batsuit is shown in the Batcave at Wayne Tower and it was later used by Kate Kane as Batwoman. A key element in some later episodes focuses on the strength of the Batsuit, which is capable of enduring weapons fire from most standard weapons without any damage, to the extent that Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox designed a gun specifically capable of penetrating the suit in the event of it being stolen. =Video games= Batman: Arkham Batman's armored costume unlocked for challenge mode in Batman: Arkham Asylum In Batman: Arkham Asylum and its subsequent sequel Arkham City the Batsuit appears more akin to that of the cloth versions often seen in the comics. But underneath the aesthetic layer was a series of armor to protect against ballistic damage. Throughout the course of the games the suit takes on more and more progressive damage. The mask contains a \\"Detective Mode\\" visor to allow Batman to investigate crime scenes, see through walls, track enemies, collect data, navigate and locate signals. The gauntlets contain not only Batman's signature spiked blades but also a hardened mini computer and remote for his vehicles. His cape is similar to the one in the Nolanverse films which permits him to glide across vast distances. His utility belt contains an array of gadgets, some of which he builds or receives over the course of the games. ;Utility Belt Arsenal: *Grapple Gun - for ascension of buildings at high speeds, to boost gliding ability, disarming criminals from a distance and opening up heavy doors. *Line Launcher - Fires a parallel line in opposite directions to accelerate over distant obstacles or tightrope walk across silently. *Batarang - for disabling thugs, opening doors or destroying things with sonic versions that disable with high frequency sound, a remote- controlled version that can navigate around and through obstacles. *Freeze Grenades - disables thugs by freezing them in place or creating floating ice for Batman to safely navigate bodies of water *Disruptor - Disables mines and various firearms. *Cryptographic Sequencer - Computer and communicator allowing Batman to hack into various systems and open various electronically locked doors. *Explosive gel - Allows Batman to spray stable explosive and demolish obstacles and walls and destroy hazardous materials. *Smoke pellets - create a cloud of smoke when thrown to mask Batman's presence to sneak up on armed opponents. In the prequel Arkham Origins the Batsuit takes on a more heavily protected armor look, more akin to the Nolan version in The Dark Knight. The ears are shorter and the cowl looks less like a mask and more like a combat helmet. After the death of the assassin the Electrocutioner, Batman obtains the killer's taser gloves from his body, using them for the rest of the game. Because of the added armor, the suit appears less damaged, only scratched, even as the game progresses. In the DLC content \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\", when facing Mister Freeze, Batman adopts a prototype Extreme Environment suit to cope with the cold conditions created by Freeze's equipment. The suit is equipped with Thermal Gloves to melt large quantities of ice, and allows him to throw thermal batarangs that are heated to destroy icicles and other objects. The suit protects Batman from cold and cryovapor, and its honeycomb structure avoids any significant increase in weight despite its new bulk. In the final sequel Arkham Knight the Batsuit takes on its most advanced and detailed look ever seen. The suit consists of two parts. One is a skintight bodysuit with hard points and the outer layer consisting of armor plating more akin to that of an armored knight of Medieval Europe. The armor panels are motorized to contract to the form of the wearer. The pieces are highly articulated as seen in the trailer where Bruce is suiting up, the chest armor has high tensile wire to hold the pieces to expand and contract as he breathes and moves giving the suit a far less bulky appearance than other previous versions. The Batsuit can also compress around wounds caused by anything capable of getting past the Batsuit's armor. It is the most armored suit in the series and may be inspired by the \\"Armored Batman\\" skin for Batman: Arkham Asylum. The Arkham Knight wears a highly military-inspired Batsuit and an Arkham symbol on his chest. His mask is a helmet that not only conceals his identity but features a heads-up display to keep track of his manned and unmanned forces throughout Gotham City. The mask also shows a map of Gotham City, seen on numerous occasions when he fights Batman. The ears on the mask serve two purposes, one to transmit commands to his troops and drones and second as psychological intimidation and mockery to the Batman. The Arkham Knight knows the influence of symbols and has adopted the Arkham Institution logo as his own in place of the bat emblem. He wears a red urban warfare style camouflage and a low slung utility belt akin to that of paratroopers. Beneath the cowl is another mask, known as a Tactical Visor in both the character showcase and referred to as such by GCPD officer Aaron Cash in red, with no eyes or mouth. This visor is later broken but repaired when The Knight is redeemed and featured as the mask of the main character in the Red Hood DLC pack. Batman: The Telltale Series The Batsuit (known as the ‚ÄúBatsuit Mark I‚Äù) in the first season of Batman: The Telltale Series draws on comparisons of the Nomex suit from Batman Begins, while the color scheme almost matches the New 52 suit. The cowl features short ears and the following functions: thermal vision, the ability to distort Batman's voice, a VR function for planned attacks and investigating crime scenes, and the ability to view reflected images, which comes in handy when a kidnapped Alfred adjusts his glasses to send images via a video Lady Arkham sends to Bruce Wayne in Episode 5. The gauntlets contain a 3D computer-like terminal whenever Batman needs to activate certain gadgets or his drones, and they allow him to scan evidence without ever touching anything; they also allow him to overhear conversations when he presses his fingers to a wall or window. Despite the suit's protection, it gets damaged in Episode 3 when Lady Arkham blasts Batman with her concussion staff. This damage can only be repaired if Wayne convinces Lucius Fox to quit at Wayne Enterprises and work for Batman full-time, or if Batman removes Penguin from Wayne Enterprises (see below). At the beginning of the game, the player can choose one of four colors for Batman's tech and the Batcomputer: blue, red, yellow, and purple. This choice does not affect much in the game except for each color having a different hidden message left by the kidnapped Alfred for Batman to find him. Towards the end of Episode 4, the player has the choice to oust Penguin as CEO of Wayne Enterprises and protect Batman's tech and gadgets, or to oust Two-Face as Mayor of Gotham and protect Wayne Manor from being burnt down. If Batman takes on Two-Face at the cost of his tech, the Mark I is rendered useless by a disruptor when Batman takes on the Children of Arkham in a hostage situation at the start of Episode 5. As a result, when he goes to rescue Alfred, Wayne is forced to use an old prototype Batsuit. This suit is little more than a skin tight suit with basic cowl functions, which forces Batman to use regular detective skills to deduce where Alfred has been taken. The suit uses the same color scheme as the first suit, albeit the colors being much darker in each respect, even shorter ears on the cowl, and the utility belt having fewer yellow accents as a result of the limited tech Batman has at his disposal. Due to the low protection, the suit is heavily damaged in the final battle against Lady Arkham. If Batman chooses to take on Penguin and protect his tech, Fox will instead give him the Batsuit Mark II for the final fight. The suit's main body is more light grey, almost silver, with the gloves (which feature no bracers), boots, cape, and cowl remaining all black. The cowl's ears are longer, and the yellow accents on the utility belt are heavily featured. With the heavier protection of the suit, it receives only a few scratches from Lady Arkham's concussion staff. For the second season, The Enemy Within, Batman utilizes a new (Mark III) suit very similar to the kevlar-plated suit from The Dark Knight. This all-black suit functions like all the other suits and offers almost as much protection as the Mark II Suit, though it already shows scratches of battle wear. The cowl's ears are long with a slight curve. The Mark I suit and whichever suit the player used at the end of the first game are featured on display in the Batcave. Unlike season one, the player can choose to change the color of Batman's tech at any point from the game's main menu (though the same four colors are the only choices once again).

It is reportedly able to detect military \\"invisible aircraft\\". Mode of operation The deployed system typically comprises a central site (containing the signal processing equipment and an ESM receiver) and two or three side sites containing only an ESM receiver. The side sites relay the signals received to the central site over a point-to-point microwave link. The central site uses the known propagation delay from the side sites to estimate the TDOA of the pulses at each site. The TDOA of a pulse between one side site and the central site locates the target on a hyperboloid. A second side site provides a second TDOA and hence a second hyperboloid. The intersection of these two hyperboloids places the target on a line, providing a 2D measurement of the target's location (no height). A third side-site provides a third hyperboloid, which, when intersected with the line provided by the other two side sites, provides a full 3D location of the target. This process is known as multilateration. The height of a target with an SSR Mode C or Mode S transponder can also be provided by decoding the Mode C or Mode S response directly, which is the normal mode of operation for the civilian VERA-AP system. System accuracy System accuracy is typically better than a microwave surveillance radar, and is a function of the deployment geometry, the inherent timing accuracy of the central site, the bandwidth of the pulse being detected and the signal-to-noise ratio. Wider separations of the side sites from the central site provide better accuracies ‚Äì but at the expense of a reduced area of common coverage. Typically side sites are deployed 15-40 km from the central site, providing a reasonable compromise of coverage and accuracy. The system is generally line-of-sight limited, with a nominal range of 450 km, the normal radio horizon. Detection of targets is within a sector of approximately 120 degrees, although IFF and SSR targets are detected using a dedicated omnidirectional antenna, and hence may be seen over 360 degrees. Up to 200 targets can be automatically tracked simultaneously, with an output rate adjustable from 1 to 5 seconds. Exploited emitters The current generation sensor can only detect and track pulsed emissions, due to the requirement to measure the time of arrival of pulses. The receivers operate in the frequency range of 1-18 GHz and typically exploit secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponders, identify friend or foe (IFF) transponders, airborne radars, weather radars, tactical air navigation (TACAN) transponders, distance measurement equipment (DME) beacons, digital communications signals and pulsed jamming signals. Versions VERA is supplied in a number of versions. VERA-AP is the civilian long-range air traffic control (ATC) version, which only exploits civilian SSR transponders at 1030 and 1090 MHz. VERA-E is the export version of the military ESM version of the system, also referred to as the VERA-S/M in its national mobile version. In addition, the shorter range VERA-P3D system is marketed for highly accurate monitoring of transponder-equipped ground vehicle movement at airports. The manufacturers also market an ESM triangulation system known as BORAP. Data Patterns Pvt Ltd, India has also established a comfortable lead with its counterpart internationally. Czech company ERA in cooperation with the German SMAG introduced a brand new mobile antenna mast for its system VERA-NG. The prototype is due to be finished in Q1/2017 and be ready for first deliveries at the end of this year. Exports Public domain literature claim VERA-E systems have been exported to Malaysia, Estonia, Pakistan and the United States. Newspaper reports also claimed that in January 2004 the Czech defence sales company, Omnipol, received licence to sell six systems to China. However, US government pressure on the Czech government resulted in the cancellation of this contract. Civil systems have been widely exported throughout Europe. Within the Czech Republic, a mobile VERA-E unit is operated by the 53rd Passive Radiotechnical Reconnaissance System and Electronic Warfare Centre at Plan√° near ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. History VERA is the latest in a long history of Czech ESM TDOA systems. The first system developed by the Czech army in 1963 was known as PRP-1 Kop√°ƒç which could track 6 targets. This was followed by KRTP-81 Ramona (NATO reporting name Soft Ball) in 1979, which could track 20 targets, and KRTP-86 Tamara (NATO reporting name Trash Can) in 1987, which could simultaneously track 23 radar targets and 48 IFF targets. These were widely exported to the former Soviet Union and beyond. These predecessors were manufactured by the state company Tesla, which collapsed after the Velvet Revolution (1989). Lead engineers from the former Tesla company formed the ERA Company in Pardubice which produces the current generation VERA family of sensors. ;Timeline * October 30, 2006 - Rannoch Corporation announced the acquisition of ERA a.s. located in Pardubice Czech Republic. * February 6, 2007 ‚Äì Rannoch Corporation has officially changed its name to Era Corporation. * July 2008 - Era Corporation was acquired by SRA International. * November 22, 2011 - ERA Pardubice was bought by Czech arms and aircraft trading company Omnipol.

This influence extends from the early music conservatories in the 16th century through the music of Alessandro Scarlatti during the Baroque period and the comic operas of Pergolesi, Piccinni and, eventually, Rossini and Mozart. The vitality of Neapolitan popular music from the late 19th century has made such songs as 'O Sole mio and Funicul√¨ Funicul√† a permanent part of our musical consciousness. Classical music The San Carlo theater (building on right in photo) in Naples. In the mid-16th century, the Spanish throne established church-run conservatories in its vice-realm of Naples. These institutions were on the premises of four churches in the city of Naples: Santa Maria di Loreto, Piet√† dei Turchini, Sant'Onofrio a Capuana, and I Poveri di Ges√π Cristo. At the time, these institutions were called \\"conservatories\\" because they \\"conserved\\"‚Äîthat is, they sheltered and educated‚Äîorphans. Since music was such an integral part of the training of the children, by the early 17th century \\"conservatory\\" had come to mean \\"music school\\" and became used in that meaning in other European languages. The Neapolitan conservatories enjoyed a considerable reputation throughout Europe as training grounds not only for young children to be trained in church music, but, eventually, as a feeder system into the world of commercial music and opera once those areas opened up in the early 17th century. This primed Naples to become one of the most important centers of musical training in Europe. By the 18th century, Naples was nicknamed the \\"conservatory of Europe\\" and was home and workshop to composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti, Pergolesi, Niccol√≤ Piccinni, Domenico Cimarosa, Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, etc. Naples was also the birthplace of the popular Neapolitan opera buffa and the site of the San Carlo Theater, built in 1737 and one of the finest musical theaters in the world. Within the courtyard of San Pietro a Maiella, the Naples Music Conservatory Under the short French rule of Murat in the early 19th century, the original four conservatories were consolidated into a single institution, which was relocated in 1826 to the premises of the ex-monastery, San Pietro a Maiella. The conservatory still bears the inscription \\"Royal Academy of Music\\" over the entrance and is still an important music school in Italy. It houses an impressive library of manuscripts pertaining to the lives and musical production of the composers who have lived and worked in Naples. Canzone Napoletana Mario Trevi Canzone Napoletana is what most people think of when they think of Neapolitan music. It consists of a large body of composed popular music‚Äîsuch songs as 'O sole mio, Torna a Surriento, Funicul√¨ funicul√†, etc. The Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s through the vehicle of an annual song writing competition for the yearly Festival of Piedigrotta, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled Te voglio bene assaie; it was composed by the prominent opera composer, Gaetano Donizetti. The festival ran regularly until 1950 when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well. The period since 1950 has produced such songs as Malafemmena by Tot√≤, Indifferentemente by Mario Trevi and Carmela by Sergio Bruni. Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become \\"classics\\" in their own right. (See main article for more information.) Neapolitan folk music The Neapolitan folk-figure, Pulcinella, playing the putip√π. By definition, this is largely anonymous music. It features traditional folk percussion instruments such as the putip√π --consisting of a membrane stretched across a resonating chamber, like a drum. A handle attached to the membrane compresses air rhythmically within the chamber; the air then spurts out of the not-quite-hermetic seal that fastens the membrane to the wooden body of the instrument to produce a \\"burping\\" sound; :triccaballacca-‚Äîa clapper, consisting of three percussive mallets mounted on a base, the outer two of which are hinged at the base and are moved in to strike the central piece; the rhythmic sound is produced by the clicking of wood on wood and the simultaneous sound of the small metal disks‚Äîcalled \\"jingles\\", mounted on the instrument; :the tambourine (called tammorra in Neapolitan dialect)--a circular frame with a single drum head stretched across one side of the instrument. There are generally small metal \\"jingles\\" mounted around the perimeter of the instrument, that sound as the tammorra is struck by the knuckles or the open hand. Often combining dance, music, and drama, the subject matter and approach to vocalizing are quite distinct from the composed stylings of the better-known Neapolitan song. =Mandolin= Neapolitan mandolin. There are various kinds of mandolins in use in Italy; they bear the names of cities or regions such as the \\"Roman\\", the \\"Lombard\\", the \\"Genovese\\", and the \\"Neapolitan\\" mandolin. (see also: mandolin). They may differ in size, shape, number of strings and tuning. The traditional Neapolitan mandolin is tear-shaped with a bowl back and a uniquely cut and shaped front (sounding board); it has eight strings paired into the four violin tunings of g, d', a', and e'. The strings are played with a plectrum, producing the rapid and characteristic tremolo sound as the plectrum moves rapidly over unison strings. In that configuration, the Neapolitan mandolin started to be manufactured widely in Naples in the mid-18th century. In spite of the modern vision of the mandolin as a quaint vehicle for older, traditional popular music such as the Canzone Napoletana, the instrument has a classical history. Students of the mandolin at the Naples Conservatory are required to perform selections from a large repertoire of music composed especially for the instrument by, among others, Vivaldi, Beethoven and Paganini. Stereotypically, the instrument is commonly used in conjunction with a guitar; the mandolin- guitar duo is the traditional instrumentation for the posteggiatori, the street musicians who wander from restaurant to restaurant and serenade for tips. There is in Naples a mandolin academy that attempts to combat that stereotype by promoting other music, classical and modern, for the instrument The Sceneggiata Mario Merola Little-known abroad, but extremely popular in Naples, is the local stage musical form called the Sceneggiata. Around the start of the 20th century, they were performed in the U.S. in areas populated by Italian immigrants. The form has been called \\"a musical soap opera\\" and generally revolves around domestic grief, the agony of leaving home, personal deceit and treachery, betrayal in love, and life in the world of petty crime. It is always sung and spoken in Neapolitan dialect. Action stops every few minutes for someone to break out in song. As a rule, many of the plots were flimsy after-the-fact vehicles to promote particular songs. The sceneggiata started shortly after World War I, was extremely popular in the 1920s, then faded, but has been enjoying somewhat of a comeback with newer generations of performers since the 1960s. The most populars performers of the genre are the Neapolitans, Mario Merola, Pino Mauro and Mario Trevi. The most popular sceneggiata ever written is Zappatore, (meaning, exactly, \\"clodbuster,\\" one who works the land and breaks up the soil for farming) written to feature a song of that name in 1929 by Bovio and Albano. It then became a stage production and was even made into a film on various occasions, the first one actually from a film company in Little Italy in New York City. The Cantautore (Literally, \\"singer-songwriter\\".) This music has been extremely popular throughout Italy for decades and its popularity continues to grow. As the name implies, this genre involves songwriters who sing their own music, inevitably songs of social protest or, at least, social relevance. Modern Neapolitan performers include Pino Daniele (probably the best-known Neapolitan cantautore, both in Naples and elsewhere), Edoardo Bennato, Nino d'Angelo, Daniele Sepe, Rita Marcotulli, Nando Citarella and Ciro Ricci. Sepe is quite influential and is known for using protest songs from all over the world and for his skills as a percussionist, flautist and saxophonist. Well-known songs in this genre include Napule √® and Terra mia, both by Pino Daniele. Globalized music Like all popular music‚Äîand even classical music (for example, The Silk Road Ensemble of cellist Yo-Yo Ma)‚Äîvery recent Neapolitan popular music has incorporated influences from a wide variety of sources, from American jazz and rock to middle-eastern and African music. One example of African influence is the recent CD Oggi o dimane by the well-known Neapolitan singer and actor Massimo Ranieri. Essentially, it is a collection of well- known Neapolitan songs composed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Marechiaro and Rundinella, backed by north African string and percussion instruments. Also, the English term \\"musical\\" (or, occasionally, the Italian commedia musicale‚Äîa translation of \\"musical comedy\\") has come to be used over the last few decades in Italy, in general, and Naples, in particular, to describe a kind of musical drama not native to Italy, a form that employs the American idiom of jazz-pop-and rock-based music and rhythms to move a story along in a combination of songs and dialogue. Obviously, the term is used to refer to original American musicals, but now is used, as well, for original productions in Italian and Neapolitan dialect. The first Italian \\"musical\\" was Carosello Napoletano, first a stage production and then a 1953 film directed by Ettore Giannini and featuring a young Sophia Loren in the cast. More recent Neapolitan musicals have been C'era una volta...Scugnizzi, based on the lives of Neapolitan street kids (\\"Scugnizzi) and Napoli 1799, about the republican revolution of 1799 that briefly overthrew the Bourbon monarchy. Venues The Teatro Mediterraneo at the Overseas Fair Grounds. The most famous place, of course, to hear music in Naples is the San Carlo opera house. Lesser-known is the smaller theater in the adjacent Royal Palace, a stage often used by the Neapolitan ballet company. Besides being the home of the opera, San Carlo is the most frequent venue several times a year for large visiting orchestras. The nearby Teatro Mercadante, a charming old theater from the late 1790s‚Äîand along with San Carlo one of the official royal theaters of the day‚Äîhas reopened after many decades of sporadic use. With the resurrection of the mammoth overseas fair grounds, the Mostra d'Oltremare (originally built in the 1930s) in the nearby community of Fuorigrotta, the Teatro Mediterraneo on those premises is now, as well, a frequent stage for all types of musical performances. The fair grounds site has the added advantage of containing, as well, the newly reopened outdoor amphiteater, the arena. It hosts summer performances of various kinds, including, most prominently, grand opera such as Verdi's Aida. There is a large program of chamber music in Naples, hosted by the Alessandro Scarlatti Association, usually staged in the Teatro delle Palme off of Via dei Mille in the Chaia section of Naples. As well, smaller groups and musical productions avail themselves of a half-dozen or so theaters around town that also double as cinemas. Additionally, the Naples music conservatory has recently refurbished and opened an auditorium on the premises and puts on regularly scheduled concerts of various kinds of music, often featuring conservatory students and faculty. Piazza del Plebiscito in Naples The largest public venue for music, parades, political rallies, installation art, New Year's celebrations, etc. is Piazza Plebiscito, the spacious open square on the west side of the Royal Palace. Other outdoor venues include the Communal Gardens, a half-mile long park along the sea-side. Also, after decades of neglect, the Trianon theater has now reopened as a theater of Neapolitan Song. It has an impressive program of traditional Neapolitan plays and musicals, an art gallery, very good acoustics, and will soon have a permanent multimedia exhibit dedicated to Enrico Caruso. The theater is located, appropriately, in a traditional part of town, Piazza Calenda, at the extreme eastern edge of the old historic center of Naples.

Younger years Born in Hassfurt, northern Bavaria, he was the son of Meir and Bertha Neuberger (n√©e Hiller), the youngest of three children.Death of Rabbi Herman N. Neuberger, Hon. Benjamin Cardin, US House of Representatives, October 25, 2005 His parents hired a teacher, or melamed, to teach him about his heritage and the Torah. When Herman was eight years old, the Neubergers moved to W√ºrzburg with its sizeable Jewish community so that the three children could prosper and learn. When Herman was only 13, a few weeks after his bar mitzvah, his father died. While in W√ºrzburg the young teenager met Rabbi Shamshon Rafael Weiss, an affluent Torah scholar who became his mentor. Rabbi Weiss convinced him that the best place for him to be was one of the larger yeshivas, so he traveled to Poland to learn in the Mir Yeshiva. By 1938, Anti-Semitism was growing in Europe due to the rise of the Nazis. Rabbi Neuberger had a relative in New York who was able to send him immigration papers to come to America. Not wanting to leave others behind, he arranged for papers for some of his close relatives too. As good fate would have it, Mrs. Bertha Neuberger and her two other children had already escaped. He also helped Rabbi Dovid Kronglass, who would later become the Mashgiach of Ner Israel, escape. In America On a visit to Baltimore, the young yeshiva student met Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman, who a few years prior had started a small yeshiva in a local synagogue, named Ner Israel. Inspired by the great man, Rabbi Neuberger decided to stay in Baltimore and learn in the yeshiva full-time. At that time, the Yeshiva was only five years old and had fewer than forty students. By 1941 the young scholar was already on the Board. He helped with administrative functions and arranged for the construction of a new school building on Garrison Blvd. Starting a yeshiva In 1942, Rabbi Neuberger married Judy Kramer, Rabbi Ruderman's sister in-law. They remained married until her death in 1994. During these early years, Rabbi Neuberger helped develop the yeshiva become a true center for Torah. Saving a nation He took part in the rescue of Persian Jewry. In 1975 the Shah was still in power in Iran and although the country was secular, Jews had few opportunities to study Torah. Rabbi Neuberger brought a small group of Iranian youngsters to the Yeshiva with the intent that they would go back to Iran after receiving their Rabbinnical degrees to become educators. Before the plan began to bear fruit, it was 1979 and the Ayatollahs took command creating a more awkward situation for Persian Jews. Through a series of connections, Rabbi Neuberger worked to help over 60,000 Jews escape from Iran in an operation still in effect today.Persian-style synagogue opening in Baltimore Recognition as a college At this point in Jewish American history, Orthodox and Haredi yeshivas were not considered colleges and their degrees were not recognized. Rabbi Neuberger, along with his lifelong friend, Rabbi Moshe Sherer started the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools to help yeshivas gain recognition amongst American Colleges. Around the country Another major accomplishment of Rabbi Neuberger was gathering married bachurim (young yeshiva-men) learning in Kollel Avodas Levi, and sending them out to open outreach kollelim around the country. Today there are kollelim in many cities including Atlanta, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; and Columbus and Cincinnati in Ohio. Influential Connections He was described as \\"politically connected\\" and was an advisor to city, state and Federal officials on matters affecting his school and fellow Jews around the world. Legacy He is survived by his five children, Rabbi Sheftel, who succeeded his father as President of Ner Israel, Rabbi Shraga, a Maggid Shiur in the Yeshiva, Yaakov and Isaac, both prominent lawyers in Baltimore, and Rabbi Ezra, Rosh Kollel of Ner Israel.

The Appalachian Trail, coinciding there with the Gulfside Trail, rises about a hundred feet approaching it northbound, and passes from the summit, below it. The Mt. Clay Loop passes over the summit. The Jewell Trail is a popular choice as a relatively less strenuous route to Mt. Washington's summit; hikers ascending it, eastbound, from the vicinity of the cog rail base station join the Gulfside Trail about from Clay's summit and about below, and give up about in descending the southern tail of Clay, before resuming the ascent of Washington. The mountain is named for Henry Clay, 19th-century senator and U.S. Secretary of State from Kentucky, known as \\"The Great Compromiser\\". In 2003, the New Hampshire state legislature, participating in a Reagan Legacy project, made it state law that Mt. Clay \\"shall hereafter be called and known as Mount Reagan,\\" after President Ronald Reagan. The legal force of this is limited to actions by the state of New Hampshire.

His father, a master tailor measured , while his siblings and mother Anne were of average size, although one sister who died in an accident at age 16 was tall. He was said to have been teased at school because of his height, though many students were scared of him. Teachers at the school were said to have punished misbehaving students by getting Bradley to lift them onto high cross beams, until the teacher decided to have them taken down again. After leaving school he worked on a farm near the town of Pocklington, earning less than 10 shillings (50p) a week. =The Yorkshire Giant= Bradley travelled with a group of showmen under the alias of the Yorkshire Giant; at the time, the freak shows were popular and would draw large crowds. As the tallest British man, Bradley was a prized asset in the business joining the huge Yorkshire Pig which was bred in Sancton two miles from Market Weighton. After touring many fairs up and down the country, including the Hull Fair, he parted from his minder by 1815 to manage himself. He would charge a shilling for each person to visit him in a room which he hired in various towns. He was even presented before King George III at Windsor who gave him a large golden watch on a chain, which he wore for the rest of his life. Bradley died aged 33 in his hometown of Market Weighton, where he was buried inside the church because of fears of graverobbing. His house still stands on Market Hill.

Examples of such sites are an active or extinct hydrothermal deposit, a dry lake or a specific polar site. Had it been funded, the rover was to be built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, based upon the Mars Science Laboratory rover design, it would have carried astrobiology-oriented instruments, and ideally, a core drill.

The mission strategy was to search for habitable zones by \\"following the water\\" and \\"finding the carbon.\\" In particular, it was to conduct detailed analysis of geologic environments identified by the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory as being conducive to life on Mars and biosignatures, past and present. Such environments might include fine-grained sedimentary layers, hot spring mineral deposits, icy layers near the poles, or sites such as gullies where liquid water once flowed or may continue to seep into soils from melting ice packs.

The AFL 'Science Steering Group' developed the following set of search strategies and assumptions for increasing the likelihood of detecting biosignatures: # Life processes may produce a range of biosignatures such as lipids, proteins, amino acids, kerogen-like material or characteristic micropores in rock. However, the biosignatures themselves may become progressively destroyed by ongoing environmental processes. # Sample acquisition will need to be executed in multiple locations and at depths below that point on the Martian surface where oxidation results in chemical alteration. The surface is oxidizing as a consequence of the absence of magnetic field or magnetosphere shielding from harmful space radiation and solar electromagnetic radiationNASA Mars Global Surveyor ‚Äîwhich may well render the surface sterile down to a depth greater than 7.5 metres (24.6 feet).Dartnell, L.R. et al., \\"Modelling the surface and subsurface Martian radiation environment: Implications for astrobiology,\\" Geophysical Research Letters 34, L02207, doi:10,1029/2006GL027494, 2007. To get under that potential sterile layer, a core drill design is currently being studied. As with any trade, the inclusion of the drill would come at the mass expense available for other payload elements. # Analytical laboratory biosignature measurements require the pre-selection and identification of high-priority samples, which could be subsequently subsampled to maximize detection probability and spatially resolve potential biosignatures for detailed analysis. Payload The conceptual payload included a Precision Sample Handling and Processing System to replace and augment the functionality and capabilities provided by the Sample Acquisition Sample Processing and Handling system that was part of the 2009-configuration of Mars Science Laboratory rover (the system is known as SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) in 2011-configuration of Mars Science Laboratory). The AFL payload was to attempt to minimize any conflicting positive detection of life by including a suite of instruments that provide at least three mutually confirming analytical laboratory measurements. For the purpose of discerning a reasonable estimate on which to base the rover mass, the conceptual payload was to include: *Precision Sample Handling and Processing System. *Forward Planetary Protection for Life-Detection Mission to a Special Region. *Life Detection- Contamination Avoidance. *Astrobiology Instrument Development. *MSL Parachute Enhancement. *Autonomous safe long-distance travel. *Autonomous single-cycle instrument placement. *Pinpoint landing (100‚Äì1000 m) (if necessary to reach specific science targets in hazardous regions). *Mobility for highly sloped terrain 30¬∞ (if required to reach science targets). Power source It was suggested that the Astrobiology Field Laboratory use radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) as its power source, like the ones to be used on the Mars Science Laboratory. The radioactive RTG power source was to last for about one Martian year, or approximately two Earth years. RTGs can provide reliable, continuous power day and night, and waste heat can be used via pipes to warm systems, freeing electrical power for the operation of the vehicle and instruments. Science Though the AFL science justification did not include a pre-definition of potential life forms that might be found on Mars, the following assumptions were made: # Life utilizes some form of carbon. # Life requires an external energy source (sunlight or chemical energy) to survive. # Life is packaged in cellular-type compartments (cells). # Life requires liquid water. Within the region of surface operations, identify and classify Martian environments (past or present) with different habitability potential, and characterize their geologic context. Quantitatively assess habitability potential by: *Measuring isotopic, chemical, mineralogical, and structural characteristics of samples, including the distribution and molecular complexity of carbon compounds. *Assessing biologically available sources of energy, including chemical, thermal and electromagnetic. *Determining the role of water (past or present) in the geological processes at the landing site. *Investigate the factors that will affect the preservation of potential signs of life (past or present) This refers to the potential for a particular biosignature to survive and therefore be detected in a particular habitat. Also, post-collection preservation may be required for later sample retrieval, although that would necessitate a further assessment of precision landing of the Mars sample return mission. *Investigate the possibility of prebiotic chemistry on Mars, including non-carbon biochemistry. *Document any anomalous features that can be hypothesized as possible Martian biosignatures. It is fundamental to the AFL concept to understand that organisms and their environment constitute a system, within which any one part can affect the other. If life exists or has existed on Mars, scientific measurements to be considered would focus on understanding those systems that support or supported it. If life never existed while conditions were suitable for life formation, understanding why a Martian genesis never occurred would be a future priority. The AFL team stated that it is reasonable to expect that missions like AFL will play a significant role in this process, but unreasonable to expect that they will bring it to a conclusion.

It is the primary language of 87,000 to 100,000 people (1986 T. C. Smith-Stark). Geographic distribution and variation Core signing populations are found in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, with a number of smaller cities containing signing communities. Some regional variation is found (80%-90% lexical similarity across the country according to Faurot et al. 2001). Variation is high between age group and people of completely different religious backgrounds. Relationship of LSM to Spanish Public service announcement with Mexican sign language interpretation LSM is quite distinct from Spanish, with completely different verb inflections, different discourse structure and preferences for word order, and little use of the verb to be. However, there is extensive use of initialised signs with one study finding 37% of a 100-word list are initialised, compared to 14% for American Sign Language (Faurot et al. 2001). The same authors suggest that the Deaf community's comprehension of the Spanish language is very low. The term \\"Signed Spanish‚Äù refers to signing that uses LSM signs (lexicon) in a Spanish word order, with some representations of Spanish morphology. There is a group of suffixes that signed Spanish uses in a way similar to that of signed English, e.g. signed symbols for -dor and -ci√≥n (for nouns). Articles and pronouns are fingerspelled. Signed Spanish (or Pidgin Signed Spanish) is often used by interpreters and during public reading or song-leading. Signed Spanish is also used by some hard of hearing and late deafened people. Relationship to other sign languages LSM is widely believed by the deaf community to have derived from Old French Sign Language (OFSL), which combined with pre-existing local sign languages and home sign systems when deaf schools were first established in 1869. However, it is mutually unintelligible with American Sign Language, which emerged from OFSL 50 years earlier in the US, although the American manual alphabet is almost identical to the Mexican one. Spanish Sign Language used in Spain is different from Mexican Sign Language, though LSM may have been influenced by it. Status In 2005, Mexican Sign Language was officially declared a \\"national language\\", along with Spanish and indigenous languages, to be used in the national education system for the deaf.Ley general - Personas con discapacidad Before 2005, the major educational philosophy in the country focused on oralism (speech and lipreading) and with few schools that conducted classes in LSM.The identity of Mexican sign as a language p.4 A 5-minute signed segment of a nightly television news program was broadcast in Signed Spanish in the mid 1980s, then again in the early 1990s, discontinued in 1992, and resumed as a 2-minute summary of headlines in 1997.

Platform hardware management generally refers to the remote monitoring of platform hardware variables such as fan speed, voltages, CPU and enclosure temperatures along with a wide range of other sensors. It also implies the ability to remotely control the power state of the platform and to reset the system back into an operational state should it \\"hang\\". A significant advantage of OPMA over previous generation management subsystem attachment methods is that OPMA does not consume a PCI socket. OPMA cards are also smaller and lower cost than their PCI predecessors. The OPMA specification, which can be freely downloaded from the web, specifies a signal list, connector and pin out, power requirements, mechanical form factor, BIOS and management controller firmware interfaces, and a detailed division of management subsystem resources between the motherboard and the mCard. OPMA enables a wide variety of mCards to individually interface to a given motherboard. It also enables a single mCard to individually interface to multiple motherboard models. OPMA is mainly targeted at server platforms where the cost of a card based management subsystem is more easily borne, but high end workstations may also leverage the specification to handle cases where remote workstation platform management is required. The OPMA interface is flexible enough to handle multiple mCard price points and capabilities ranging from basic IPMI based management to those that support KVMoIP, remote virtual media, and newer external interface standards that require a larger on-card resource footprint such as WS-Management. OPMA supports two basic management subsystem connection paradigms. The first is where virtually the entire management subsystem resides on the mCard. Using this paradigm, the platform contains no basic management controller of any sort and relies on the presence of an OPMA card for all remote hardware management capabilities. In the second paradigm, the basic management module is soldered to the motherboard and the OPMA connector is used as an upgrade path for advanced platform management features. In this case, which is known as \\"upgrade kit mode\\", the OPMA card is able to access all sensors supported by the soldered down management controller using an SMBus link over which the Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) protocol is employed. OPMA also leverages the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) specification in order to provide a basic plug and play capability. Using IPMI-defined OEM command extensions, the system and the mCard exchange basic information during system boot such as mCard/motherboard make and model, specification version compliance, and optional capabilities defined by the OPMA specification. History OPMA was created as a joint technology development effort between AMD and various platform management subsystem technology companies such as Agilent, AMI, Avocent, and Raritan Embedded Solutions (formerly called Peppercon). When OPMA was first released in February 2005, platform hardware management was being treated as a value added feature by OEMs. This resulted in a constant redesign of the management card infrastructure such that no two motherboard manufacturers could use the same card. Lack of standards and constant redesign resulted in higher end user costs. While PCI based management cards were available which could be plugged into a variety of platforms, the PCI bus did not provide direct access to all of the sensors needed to manage the hardware aspects of a platform. To gain full sensor access, custom headers had to be added to motherboards. Custom cables then linked these sideband signals between the card and the motherboard. PCI based platform management cards also consume a PCI slot which is a premium resource for many servers. This is especially true of those using the 1U rack format and those which need PCI slots for RAID interface cards that enhance system hard disk throughput. AMD engineering teams were internally tasked with building server reference designs to support Opteron server processor evaluation by customers. During these early internal server design efforts it was determined that a standard management card subsystem that was reusable across many platforms would decrease time to market while saving design and support costs for AMD reference design platforms in the field. Such an interface would also allow AMD to outsource the design and test of the management card to industry experts. AMD reasoned that external audiences would derive these same benefits as its internal engineering teams and so OPMA was documented and released. Adoption According to AMD's press releases, there has been significant interest in OPMA by the server industry platform and infrastructure providers. Some of the motherboards may be seen using links in the external links section. To date, no tier one computer OEMs have offered OPMA enabled motherboards for sale.

RASP is designed to prepare soldiers, many of whom have just graduated Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training and are still considered \\"fresh\\" recruits, for assignment to the 75th Ranger Regiment. Soldiers from other units attempting to transfer to the 75th Ranger Regiment also attend the course, but are less common than new soldiers. Follow-on courses including Airborne School and MOS-specific training like SOCM are also required for RASP graduates. Graduates are in jeopardy of losing all affiliation with the Ranger regiment if they fail to complete their follow-on training. Unsuccessful trainees will be reassigned to another unit. History After 1st Ranger Battalion was reformed in 1974, selections were held directly by them. When 2nd Ranger Battalion was formed shortly thereafter, they began hosting their own selection as well. In 1986, when the Regimental Headquarters was fully formed, a new consolidated RIP (Ranger Indoctrination Program) was started at Fort Benning, beginning in February 1985, where it was held until 2009 when it was changed to RASP. In 2017 it was reported in Army Times that an unidentified woman was the first to pass the 21-day Ranger Assessment & Selection Program II (RASP II). This woman became the first to graduate from the selection program of a special operations unit. Previously in June of 2016, a noncommissioned officer had attempted to pass the test, but dropped out. Course RASP is designed to weed out those who do not truly have the physical or mental capabilities to serve in the 75th Ranger Regiment. The training curriculum was specifically designed to \\"smoke\\" the trainees through endless punishment via constant physical training. In the second and fourth week of RASP, the class is sent to \\"Cole Range\\"; a remote training area of Fort Benning. It is designed to test the individual to their breaking point both physically and mentally; trainees sleep on average 4 hours total throughout Cole Range as they spend their nights doing tedious tasks such as the \\"hitting the wood line\\" for being incapable of meeting the given time standards. Although training such as patrolling and land navigation is taught at Cole Range, the main focus is to mentally and physically break down the individual. For classes held in the winter; it is not uncommon for 30‚Äì50% of the starting class to quit during the first night of Cole Range. RASP is broken down into two levels of training: RASP 1 for Junior Noncommissioned Officers and Enlisted Soldiers (pay grades E-1 through E-5) and RASP 2 for Senior Noncommissioned Officers, Officers and Warrant Officers. Candidates will train on physical fitness, marksmanship, small unit tactics, medical proficiency and mobility. Training is fast-paced and intense, ensuring Ranger candidates are prepared to employ their skills in both continued training and worldwide operations upon reaching their assigned Ranger unit. Throughout the course all candidates will be screened to ensure that only the best Soldiers are chosen for service in the Ranger Regiment. Regardless of the course, all candidates must meet the course requirements in order to serve in the Ranger Regiment. As of January 2010, the 4-week Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP) has become RASP (Ranger Assessment and Selection Program) and is now 8 weeks long. There are two separate phases in the RASP program. Phase 1 primarily consists of day to day, week to week physical and mental toughness training, and includes rigorous \\"smoke\\" sessions (blocks of time specifically geared toward using physical training as a tool for corrective training and instruction) that are used to train the group if a particular task, condition, or standard is not met, and also incorporate a necessary environment of the unknown to each soldier. Phase 2 training includes marksmanship and baseline breaching abilities. Ranger history is also the subject of training. Graduation Upon successful completion of RASP, the new Rangers graduate at the Ranger Memorial, or in the event of inclement weather, Freedom Hall where they will don the tan Ranger beret and will have the scroll of the battalion they will be assigned to put on their shoulder. Officers, Commissioned and Noncommissioned As of 2010, all NCOs and Officers must go through RASP to be assigned to the Regiment. An officer or an NCO wishing to move up a position within the Regiment also must complete the RASP, again. Any officer or NCO who leaves the Regiment for professional timeline, and wishes to return at a higher rank, must also complete the RASP, again. This change has resulted in an extreme professionalization across all ranks, where every commander, all the way to the Regimental Commander, and every senior NCO to the Regimental CSM, has completed the RASP multiple times in their career. Officers and NCOs have a shorter RASP, focusing on attributes and physical fitness. Every evaluation report throughout one's career is reviewed, along with letters of recommendation. Psychological evaluation, intelligence test, and a thorough physical fitness test (United States Army Physical Fitness Test with pull-ups, Combat Water Survival Test (CWST), 5-mile run, 12-mile road march) topped off with a detailed board run by senior Regimental leaders ensure that only the best are selected. Any MOS may be accepted, although Rangers, and Airborne qualified personnel are priority with non-Rangers and non-airborne personnel accepted, contingent on their successful completion of those courses immediately following RASP.

The Macy‚ÄìColby House is a historically significant saltbox house at 257 Main Street in Amesbury, Massachusetts. It is a historic house museum and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2008. In addition to its great age, it is notable for its association with Thomas Macy, an early settler of Nantucket and the subject of a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, and for its long association with the locally significant Colby family. History The Macy‚ÄìColby House was originally built by Thomas Macy, probably about 1649, and sold to Anthony Colby in 1654. The saltbox structure was extensively modified by Obadiah Colby (1706‚Äì1749) in the early 1740s. Thomas Macy was Amesbury's first town clerk; he held many town offices, and was involved in numerous land transactions. He left Amesbury in 1659 after years of conflict with local Puritan leaders, most notably over giving shelter to Quakers in this house. He became the first European settler to establish his family on the island of Nantucket. Macy became the subject of a poem by the 19th-century poet John Greenleaf Whittier entitled \\"The Exile\\", depicting the plight of Quakers in the religiously intolerant Puritan society of colonial Massachusetts. Anthony Colby (1605‚Äì1660/61) came to America with the Winthrop fleet in 1630. He first settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was in Salisbury, Massachusetts, by 1640. He was one of the first settlers of the new town of Amesbury in 1650. He was active in town affairs, served in various offices, and was part owner of a local sawmill. Anthony Colby's descendants owned the Macy‚ÄìColby property for 245 years; nine generations of Colbys lived in this house. In 1899, Moses Colby (1822‚Äì1901) donated the house and property to the Bartlett Cemetery Association as a memorial to the Colby and Macy families, and to the people of Amesbury, Massachusetts. The property is maintained by the Friends of the Macy‚ÄìColby House Association, and is open to the public on Saturdays during the summer.

The film was shot on hand-held cameras using jump cuts and other visual techniques. It covers a wide array of themes and genres, from social realism to coming-of-age to crime. A theme song for the film under Yen Town Band, titled \\"Swallowtail Butterfly (Ai no Uta)\\", gained first place on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart of October 7, 1996. Plot The film is set in Tokyo at an unspecified point in the near future when the Japanese yen has become the strongest currency in the world. This attracts an influx of immigrants, legal and illegal, to work in the city. The immigrants give the city the nickname . The Japanese natives, however, despise the nickname, and in retribution call the immigrants by the homophone , anglicised as \\"Yentowns\\" in the film's English subtitles. The story centers around a sixteen-year-old girl (Ito) whose mother has just died. The girl is passed on from person to person until she is taken in by a Chinese Yentown prostitute named Glico (Chara), who names her Ageha (Japanese for swallowtail). Under Glico's care, Ageha starts a new life. The immigrant characters, who speak Japanese, English, Mandarin, or Cantonese, earn their living by committing petty crimes and engaging in prostitution. Ageha does not participate in any of these activities, but is protected by Glico and the other immigrants. The film does not make clear whether Ageha is Japanese or an Asian immigrant. Eventually, due to a sudden twist of fate, the immigrants are given a chance to realize their various dreams. But in doing so, they destroy their solidarity, and have to face their problems separately.

Before moving to Paris she was the dance critic for The Christian Science Monitor. During the years of World War I she was a dancer and performed under the stage name of 'Rihani', inventing a dance style called 'static dances'. She was a well-known figure in the American community of artists in Paris in the 1920s. She was briefly married to the poet Skipwith Cannell but divorced him in the spring of 1921, later marrying French poet Roger Vitrac. William Carlos Williams describes her thus: \\"Kitty Cannell in her squirrel coat and yellow skull cap, which made the French, man and woman, turn in the street and stare seeing a woman, approaching six feet, so accoutered\\". She had an affair with Harold Loeb and they socialized with Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley. In A Farewell to Arms Hemingway based the character Helen Ferguson on Kitty, and also the character Frances Clyne in The Sun Also Rises, although she denied this, but a reading of her letters to Loeb indicates strong parallels with the story. She became the Paris fashion correspondent for The New Yorker, and, during the German occupation, reported on occupying forces' press conferences for the New York Times. Her only book was Jam Yesterday, a memoir of her childhood, which was spent shuttling back and forth between the U.S. and Canada. It was published by William Morrow & Company in 1945. Her papers are held by Harvard University's Houghton Library.

He is credited as being one of the founders of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas. Evangelista was also an influential head of the Congreso Obrero de Filipinas, at the time the foremost and largest trade federation in the Philippines, having served as secretary for multiple years. He also headed the Union de Impresores de Filipinas as its Secretary-General. Prior to forming the PKP, Evangelista was a member of the Partido Obrero de Filipinas, a Filipino workers' party with increasingly radical leanings. Evangelista was eventually captured by the Japanese during the Second World War and executed. Biography On May Day 1913, together with Hermenegildo Cruz, he had attempted to guarantee basic workers' rights and unify the trade unions in the country. After defecting from the Nacionalista Party with its left wing allies, he became one of the founders (1922) and early leaders of the increasingly Marxist Partido Obrero de Filipinas, which became the Progressive Workers Party. Around it, he formed a new trade union federation, one that was more radical in its goals. Evangelista was one of five members of the inaugural executive committee of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, established in 1927 as a Pacific regional subdivision of the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU, commonly known as the Profintern).William Lawrence, \\"Australia and the Comintern ‚Äî An Incident,\\" Australian Quarterly, vol. 23, no. 3 (Sept. 1951), pg. 72.

Jailed towards the end of the decade, Evangelista was involved in informal talks with President Manuel L. Quezon, negotiating a social peace.

History With the city of Tijuana already undergoing fast development, especially as a strategically located border town between the U.S. and M√©xico back in the middle of the 1900s, the need for higher education for its fast growing population soon became imminent; the need to offer post-secondary studies spurred the creation of the first high school ('preparatoria' as it is called in M√©xico) in the region, this at a time when Baja California was still considered as a territory (and therefore highly dependent upon the federal government regarding its governance and administration), before becoming a proper 'State' of Mexico. In 1946 a group of nine students started their studies in an education center that now caters about 5,000 students. Mission, vision and values The school's mission as it is stated in their school manual: The vision shared by those who are part of the educational institution: Origins The school was founded based on Federal Cooperation on September 2, 1946, on the premises of the Alvaro Obreg√≥n School, situated at the southwest hillside part of Tijuana, which is now the site of The House of Culture, by its founder, Professor Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain, named as the first director of the federal high school in operation there. In 1950, he moved together with the Secondary Studies section to the Centro Escolar de Agua Caliente to merge this with the Industrial Technical Institute on the same site. The educational complex was initiated by a group of local teachers and professionals led by Professor Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain. Teachers pioneered by Rosas Garcia Jose Efrain, and Angel Morales Barraza, Angel Ruiz Ojeda, Alfonso G√≥mez Pereira, Gabriel Moreno Lozano, Maximum Argout, Luis Torres Coto, Margarita Ruiz Diaz, Ildefonso Corella and Tiburcio G√≥mez Alatorre . Subsequently, joined by others like Miguel Bargall√≥ Ard√©vosol, Maria Luisa Bargall√≥, Guillermo Caballero Sosa, Julio Torres Coto, Froylan Esparza, Jose Alberich, Aurelio Magro, Antonio Blanco and Gonz√°lez Atenogenes. =1960s= In 1960 the High School joined the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Baja California (UABC), thus giving birth to the University being implemented in the Coastal Zone, without losing its dependence from the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica (SEP). In 1961 a divergent movement arose that resulted in the first semester of a school year ending in June, resuming activities with a second semester starting in September, later in the same calendar year.. =1970s= In 1971 the school adopted the name 'L√°zaro C√°rdenas', after the former Mexican president famous for, amongst other measures, the nationalization of the oil industry and largely improving and expanding education throughout the country, who had died on October 19, 1970. In 1972 major changes set educational standards such as: * Plan of study of 6 semesters * Morning schedule of classes * Pioneering the specialized skills programs in ten different professional areas. Federalization Decree 'Sure, from this moment this is a federalized High School!' was the response given by the President of Mexico, Luis Echeverria Alvarez, to the pledge posed to him with a blanket by a large crowd of students on the night of December 2, 1973, at the school's 'Salvador Allende' Civic Plaza. With the arrival of Professor Jes√∫s Ruiz Barraza, a series of measures were taken which transformed the school from a small provincial one to a large high school . In 1972, within the context of educational reform set forth by president Echeverria's government, the school was incorporated into the 'National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education' classification (ANUIES), abandoning the two-year plan in use since 1946, and supplying a three-year high school education program providing real job training in various professional specialties. Before 1972, classes were only held in the evening in limited-space premises known as High School 19. Due to the constantly growing demand of students seeking high school education, Barraza pointed to the need to hold classes during the morning hours. With limited resources additional classrooms were built, allowing enrollment to increase to just over 1,000 secondary education students. President Echeverr√≠a granted the request and, in May 1972, a group of students invited the president, while visiting the city, to see the school's facilities. Students and campus leaders were asking for laboratories, classrooms and sports fields and, most importantly the federalization of the school; President Echeverria fulfilled the request, and awarded two million pesos for the construction of an all-new building. From then onwards the school ceased to be funded by its students, and joined the federation. During another visit to Tijuana on 2 December 1973, President Echeverria inaugurated the new facilities and publicly declared the official federalization of the school. From that point, the school became a member institution of the Federal Education System thus receiving federal financial funding for its operations, staff, maintenance and expansion of facilities. The school's graduates have a statistically higher than average performance record in Tijuana and the state of Baja California, and Mexico, in general. =1980s= The school began offering adult, night school classes in 1983.

But students are also required to master the English language, on an 80% minimum ratio. Students usually enroll for IB examinations in May. The International Baccalaureate (IB) aims to develop caring, informed and eager for knowledge students, who help to create a better and more peaceful world in the context of mutual understanding and intercultural respect. In pursuit of this objective, the organization works with schools, governments and international organizations to develop challenging programs of international education and demanding rigorous assessment. These programs encourage students across the world to adopt an active attitude of lifelong learning, to be compassionate and understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right. The main objective of the IB program is to train internationally minded people, aware of the condition that unites human beings and the shared responsibility to ensure the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world.

Space and weight was reserved for one catapult and its seaplane, but they were not fitted until after she was completed.Raven and Roberts, p. 266 A second catapult, intended to be mounted on 'B' turret, was deleted from the design during construction.Raven and Roberts, p. 133 Service HMS York entering Havana harbour, January 1938 York was laid down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Jarrow, on 18 May 1927, launched on 17 July 1928 and was completed on 1 May 1930. She became the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet upon commissioning.Raven and Roberts, pp. 139, 414 Between 1931 and 1934 she was commanded by Captain Richard Bevan. She served with the 8th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station, and was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 and 1936 for the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, before returning to the American Station until the outbreak of war in September 1939.Whitley, p. 94 The ship was transferred to Halifax, Nova Scotia that same month for convoy escort duties. In October 1939, York was assigned to Force F at Halifax, which was active in hunting for commerce raiders and protecting convoys. She was briefly refitted in Bermuda between 31 October and 22 November before she returned to Great Britain for a more thorough refit in December. Upon its completion on 9 February York was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of Home Fleet. On 3 March 1940 the ship intercepted the German blockade runner Arucas in the Denmark Strait near Iceland, but she was scuttled by her own crew before she could be captured. In early April 1940, York, and the rest of her squadron, were assigned to carry troops under Plan R 4, the British plan to invade Norway. The troops were disembarked on 8 April when the British learned of the imminent German invasion of Norway and the squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral John Cunningham, joined the bulk of the Home Fleet already at sea.Rohwer, p. 18 On 10 April the destroyer was badly damaged by air attack and York was detailed to tow her to Lerwick for repairs.Haar (2009), pp. 289, 357 The ship, and the light cruisers and , ferried the 1st Battalion of the Green Howards and other troops from Rosyth to √Öndalsnes and Molde on 24‚Äì25 April. York returned home on 26 April.Haar (2010), pp. 87‚Äì88 York was one of the ships used to evacuate British and French troops from Namsos, along with three French transports and a number of British destroyers, on the evening of 1/2 May.Haar (2010), pp. 169‚Äì72 =In the Mediterranean= Starboard side view of the abandoned Italian destroyer Artigliere In August 1940 York was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, joining the 3rd Cruiser Squadron in Alexandria in late September, after escorting a convoy around the Cape of Good Hope. Two days later she participated in Operation MB.5, where the Mediterranean Fleet escorted the light cruisers and as they ferried troops to Malta.Rohwer, p. 43 During the Battle of Cape Passero, York sank the disabled and abandoned destroyer Artigliere on 13 October after the destroyer's engagement with the light cruiser the previous evening. A month later York and the Mediterranean Fleet executed Operation MB8, a complex series of manoeuvers, including Operation Judgement, where the ship escorted the aircraft carrier as her aircraft attacked the Italian Fleet at Taranto on the evening of 11/12 November. A few days later York ferried British troops from Alexandria, Egypt, to Piraeus, Greece. On 26 November, York, and the rest of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, covered a small convoy to Malta.Rohwer, pp. 44, 47‚Äì49 The Mediterranean Fleet, including York, sortied on 16 December to conduct air strikes on Italian shipping, airbases on Rhodes and to bombard Valona.Rohwer, pp. 52 In early January 1941 the ship escorted the tanker and four s to Suda Bay, Crete, and covered operations in the Eastern Mediterranean during Operation Excess. She arrived back at Alexandria on 16 January. York returned to Suda Bay in early February for operations against Italian shipping.Rohwer, p. 58 During Operation Lustre in March, she protected troop convoys from Egypt to Greece. =Fate= The crippled HMS York in Suda Bay, May 1941 York was disabled at Suda Bay in Crete by two Italian explosive motorboats of the Italian Regia Marina assault Flotilla Decima Flottiglia MAS, launched by the destroyers Crispi and Sella on 26 March 1941; the two old destroyers were fitted with special cranes to operate assault craft. Six motorboats entered the bay, led by Tenente di vascello Luigi Faggioni, and attacked three targets in pairs; the first was York, second the tanker Pericles and last another ship at anchor. Three of the attacking boats had various problems, either mechanical or human, due to the extreme temperature conditions, but the other three successfully attacked their targets. Two motorboats, packed with charges in the bows, struck York amidships, flooding both boiler rooms and one engine room. Two British seamen were killed.Waldemar Benedyczak, Debiut w Zatoce Suda [Debut at Suda Bay] in: Okrƒôty Wojenne Nr. 2/1993, pp. 39-40 All Italian sailors survived the attack and fell into British hands. The ship was run aground to prevent her from sinking. The submarine was used to supply electrical power to operate the cruiser's guns for anti-aircraft defence, until Rover was severely damaged by air attack and had to be towed away for repairs. On 18 May, further damage was inflicted by German bombers and the ship was damaged beyond repair. Her main guns were wrecked by demolition charges on 22 May 1941 when the Allies began to evacuate Crete. Yorks wreck was salvaged in February 1952 by an Italian shipbreaker and towed to Bari to be broken up, beginning on 3 March.

AFL career Known affectionately as \\"The Big Heffa\\", Chris began his career in 1997 with the Essendon Football Club. Heffernan had a brilliant year in 2000 when he played solid consistent football in the midfield and was part of the Bombers side that lost only one game for the entire season, winning the AFL Grand Final and Ansett Cup Final in the process. Heffernan was also rewarded with an appearance in the International rules series in 2000. Heffernan also played in another AFL Grand Final (albeit a losing one) in 2001. However, when Essendon ran into salary cap issues at the end of the 2002 season, he was traded to the Melbourne Football Club for a swap of first round draft selections. His trade to Melbourne only months after signing a three-year contract with Essendon, prompted the AFL Players Association to introduce the Heffernan Clause into the players standard collective bargaining agreement, to prevent players from being traded within 12 months of signing a contract. Heffernan did not have the same spark at Melbourne. He finished the 2003 with a depressed fracture of his cheekbone and had a solid year in 2004 before getting suspended and missing the finals at the end of the season, but in 2005 his performances were average. At the end of 2005 Melbourne delisted Heffernan, but Essendon picked him up with the last pick in the 2006 AFL preseason draft. Heffernan played out the rest of his career with the Bombers, before announcing his retirement from AFL football on 2 October 2007 after being told that he was unlikely to play often under new coach Matthew Knights. In 2020, Heffernan released his Autobiography \\"Heffernan: More than meets the eye\\". The book was poorly received, with very limited sales thought to be mostly family and friends. Personal life After retiring from football he worked in New York for Deutsche Bank for three years before returning to Melbourne to work for Ernst and Young. In 2011 he joined the Essendon Football Club board as a non- executive director.

PRI was formed on March 13, 1994, to take over two Southern Pacific Railroad lines. One of SP's lines was the West Side Line (47.8 miles) between Fresno northwest to Oxalis, California and a branch running from Ingle to Burrell (25.2 miles). The other line was the SP Buttonwillow Branch (32.7 miles) from Bakersfield (Kern Junction) to Buttonwillow, California. PRI was related to the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. Both PRI and the SJVR were subsidiaries of Kyle Railways. Because PRI and the SJVR were related, the SJVR provided the motive power for PRI. On April 26, 1996, Kyle Railways merged PRI into the SJVR. PRI handled about 8,000 cars per year (1996 estimate). History The Southern Pacific constructed the West Side Line that ran from Tracy down the west side of the San Joaquin Valley to Fresno between 1888-1891. The Buttonwillow Branch was constructed by the Southern Pacific after 1910. The Buttonwillow Branch has about of track abandoned in the late 1950s east from Buttonwillow to Olig with stations listed as Lokern, Asphalto and McKittrick. Asphalto was the location of a historic Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1. McKittrick is famous for the McKittrick Tar Pits naturally occurring asphalt tar pits. According to an article by Don Browen, \\"the Port Railroad took over the former Southern Pacific Buttonwillow Branch from Kern Junction to Buttonwillow and of S.P.'s former Westside Branch from Fresno to Oxalis. Additionally S.P.'s former 24.6 Riverdale Branch from Ingle on the Westside Branch to Burrell was included in the transaction. This is a long term lease and not a purchase by Kyle Railways. What is the significance of the name Port Railroad? Kyle owned the name Port Railroad which it used for its railroad in San Francisco. When this railroad ceased operations, Kyle had an extra name which it decided would be used for its latest California acquisition. 3 more locomotives, 2037, 2041, and 2042, were obtained for the increased workload.\\" See also *List of defunct California railroads References External links *Information about Buttonwillow Branch Defunct California railroads Spin-offs of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company ","title":"Port Railroads, Inc."},{"id":"3507308","text":"Mount Saint Joseph College (commonly MSJ or Mount Saint Joe) is a Catholic college preparatory school and secondary school / high school for young men from ninth to twelfth grade sponsored by the Xaverian Brothers and founded in 1876.

Bathers immerse themselves in hay which releases heat from biodecomposition. Information Heubad was ostensibly discovered by a tired field worker who, after resting in the hay after several hours of manual labor, felt refreshed and rejuvenated. Heubad is commonly and most popularly done in the Hotel Heubad Spa in V√∂ls am Schlern, Italy. There, people taking part in Heubad burrow in the moist fermented hay for about twenty minutes, followed by lying down on a couch and relaxing for another thirty minutes. This process is considered to open up pores, detoxify the body, soothe aches and pains, and to stimulate the metabolism. The hay is heated to the temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit before the people lie in it. The hay used for the Heubad treatment is cut during July and August in the Dolomite mountains, about 2,000 meters above sea level.

The system used the principle of multilateration and was capable of simultaneously manually tracking up to six targets. It was first deployed in 1963 and was also known by its serial number, PRP-1. The initials PRP come from the Czech \\"P≈ôesn√Ω radiotechnick√Ω p√°traƒç\\", meaning \\"Accurate Radiotechnical Locator\\", the name comes from \\"Korelaƒçn√≠ p√°traƒç\\", meaning \\"Correlation Locator\\".

Her pen name is lowercase: l√™ th·ªã di·ªÖm th√∫y. Life L√™ was born in the South Vietnamese village of Phan Thi·∫øt on January 12, 1972, during the Vietnam War. In 1978, L√™ left her homeland alongside her father in a small fishing boat.Baumann, Paul, \\"Washing Time Away\\", The New York Times, May 25, 2003. They were picked up by an American naval ship and placed in a refugee camp in Singapore. She eventually resettled in Southern California with her father. They lived in Linda Vista, San Diego,\\"California Stories Uncovered: Stories for the 21st Century \\", California Council for the Humanities in decaying 1940s‚Äì'50s Navy housing, which they shared with fellow Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian \\"boat people,\\" immigrants displaced by war. L√™'s mother and sister joined them two years later, via a camp in Malaysia. Two of L√™'s siblings drowned during her childhood: her eldest brother drowned in the ocean in Vietnam when he was six, while a sister drowned in a Malaysian refugee camp. L√™ adopted the name of her deceased sister after her father mistakenly reported her name when they were rescued at sea. She has four surviving siblings, two of whom were born in America. L√™ was inspired to write by her love of fairy tales. Reading a book of Grimms' Fairy Tales, she recalls, \\"I felt transported. Things happen very suddenly in fairy tales: A man puts on a cloak and vanishes. I could relate to that. Once I was somewhere and then I was here, and everything had vanished. I didn't take it as fantastic. I thought it was real.\\"Mehegan, David. \\"Refuge in Her Writing.\\" The Boston Globe, June 2, 2003. B7. Print. She moved to Massachusetts in 1990 to enroll in Hampshire College, where she concentrated on cultural studies and post-colonial literature. She chose the school because of its individualized, multidisciplinary curriculum and her desire to get as far away from San Diego as possible. In 1993, L√™ traveled to Paris to research French colonial postcards from the early 1900s‚Äìimages of Vietnamese people taken by French photographers. Some of the images she collected would later appear in her performance work. It was in France that she solidified her identity as an American, with English as her preferred language. \\"Being in France and not hearing English every day,\\" she says, \\"helped clarify how I hear English and carry it inside me.\\" On her return to Hampshire College, she wrote poems, prose, and pieces of dialog that would form the foundation for her senior thesis and first solo performance work Mua He Do Lua/Red Fiery Summer. After graduation, she traveled the United States from 1995 to 1997 performing her play Red Fiery Summer in community spaces and formal theaters. In 1996, she was commissioned to write her second solo performance work, the bodies between us, which was subsequently produced by New WORLD Theater. In the same year, she published a prose piece entitled \\"The Gangster We Are All Looking For\\" in the Massachusetts Review. It was rerun in Harper's Magazine later that year, and caught the attention of literary agent Nicole Aragi, who urged L√™ to expand the work into a novel. The unfinished book was picked up in 1999 by publisher Alfred A. Knopf. In 1998, while working on her book, L√™ returned to Vietnam for the first time in 20 years, with her mother. Her trip made her appreciate how much her parents had suffered when they settled in the United States. \\"It was profoundly sad for me,\\" she says. \\"The most powerful thing was this [extended] family. I must have been related to 200 people there. I realized how isolated my parents must have felt, the extent of what they had lost and had never been able to regain.\\" Her mother returned to Vietnam permanently in 2001 after she was diagnosed with cancer. She is buried in her home village of Phan Thi·∫øt. Le's father moved back to Vietnam in 2003. Le was cited by The New York Times as one of its \\"Writers On The Verge\\" shortly before her novel, The Gangster We Are All Looking For, was published by Knopf (2003), to glowing reviews. Her work has appeared in the Massachusetts Review, Harper's Magazine, and the anthology The Very Inside, and among her awards are Fellowships from the Radcliffe and Guggenheim foundations. Her solo performance work includes Red Fiery Summer and The Bodies Between Us, which have been performed throughout the United States at venues including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Vineyard Theater, as well as in Europe. While the former piece reflects many stories later included in The Gangster ..., L√™ is currently basing her next novel on the latter. > I go about things in an oblique way.

MOLCAS is developed by scientists to be used by scientists. It is not primarily a commercial product and it is not sold in order to produce a fortune for its owner (the Lund University). Focus in the program is placed on methods for calculating general electronic structures in both ground and excited states. MOLCAS contains codes for general and effective multiconfigurational SCF calculations at the Complete Active Space (CASSCF) level, but also employing more restricted MCSCF wave functions (RASSCF). It is also possible, at this level of theory, to optimize geometries for equilibrium and transition states using gradient techniques and to compute force fields and vibrational energies. MOLCAS also contains second order perturbation theory codes CASPT2 and RASPT2.  History  MOLCAS code has been created at the late 1980s by the group of Prof. Bj√∂rn O. Roos at Lund University. The name of the program is a combination of Molecule (integral code by Jan Alml√∂f) and CAS (Complete Active Space program developed by Bj√∂rn O. Roos). MOLCAS 2 has been released at 1992. It was distributed on a tape for IBM VM/XA. It contains new configuration interaction code (written by Jeppe Olsen), new integral code (written by Roland Lindh) and coupled cluster code (written at Comenius University). MOLCAS 4 (1999) was a first release, which runs on any Unix or Linux operating system. In 2001 MOLCAS 5 has been released, featuring a distributed model for code development. In September 2017 the bulk of the MOLCAS code was branched as open source (LGPL 2.1 license), under the name OpenMolcas.  Major features  Main features of MOLCAS can be found at the Molcas manual, Collection of Molcas tutorials and publications about different version of MOLCAS: MOLCAS 6, MOLCAS 7 and MOLCAS 8.

History Ramona's designation was KRTP-81 and it carried the NATO reporting name of Soft Ball. The serial number was derived from the Czech phrase \\"Komplet radiotechnick√©ho pr≈Øzkumu\\" meaning \\"Radiotechnical Reconnaissance Set\\". A later upgraded version was designated KRTP-81M. Ramona was deployed in 1979 and could semi-automatically track 20 targets simultaneously. It superseded Kop√°ƒç. Appearance Each receiver comprised a large spherical radome mounted on the top of a 25 m fixed mast. This radome, made of identical segments of polyurethane foam, contained the radio antennas and the microwave components, intermediate frequency preamplifiers and the two-way communications equipment for communicating between central and side sites. At first glance the system bore a striking resemblance to typical Eastern European water towers. Mode of operation The deployed system typically comprises a central site (containing the signal processing equipment and an ESM receiver) and two or three side sites containing only an ESM receiver. The side sites relay the signals received to the central site over a point-to-point microwave link. The central site uses the known propagation delay from the side sites to estimate the TDOA of the pulses at each site. The TDOA of a pulse between one side site and the central site locates the target on a hyperboloid. A second side site provides a second TDOA and hence a second hyperboloid. The intersection of these two hyperboloids places the target on a line, providing a 2D measurement of the target's location (no height). Ramona operated over the frequency range of 0.8-18 GHz and provided surveillance over a sector of approximately 100 degrees. System deployment was complex and took between 4 and 12 hours. The system was transportable using thirteen Tatra T138 trucks. Exports 17 Ramona systems and 14 upgraded Ramona-M systems were built. Of these, 14 Ramona and 10 upgraded systems were exported to the Soviet Union. Of these, the system with serial number 104 was deployed by the Soviet Union in North Korea. Other systems were exported to the German Democratic Republic. Syria received four (three Ramona-M) between 1981-94. One of these systems was deployed to Djebel Baruk in Lebanon. This site was first attacked by Israeli Air Force and then occupied by IDF during june 1982.

It is the passenger terminus of two narrow gauge railways: the Ffestiniog Railway, which was opened in 1836 to carry dressed slate from the Quarries around Blaenau Ffestiniog to the sea port of Porthmadog, for export by sea; and the Welsh Highland Railway, incorporated in 1923, which ran to Dinas. After rebuilding in 1997-2011, the other terminus is at Caernarfon, in sight of the Castle.  History  The station is built at the western end of the Cob, the great embankment across the Traeth Mawr, on a peninsula from Ynys Madoc constructed in 1842 to form a slate wharf and a harbour wall. It was opened for passenger service on 6 January 1865. Welsh Highland Railway trains served the station from 1923, with a short period when all passenger traffic was diverted to Portmadog New station near the crossing with the Cambrian railway, that building being long since demolished. The ill- funded WHR closed in 1936. Harbour Station was closed to passengers on 15 September 1939, although slate trains continued operating through the Second World War until 1946. The buildings continued to be in use as the principal offices of the Festiniog Railway Company and the home of Manager (Mr Robert Evans) including throughout the years of almost total closure from 1 August 1946 to 24 September 1954. The station reopened for passengers on 23 July 1955.  Welsh Highland Railway  Since 2011, following completion of the Cross Town Rail Link (CTRL), the station is also the terminus of the Welsh Highland Railway, which is owned by the Festiniog Railway Company. This line runs trains, via the cross town link through Porthmadog, to Beddgelert, Rhyd Ddu, Waunfawr, and Caernarfon. The WHR was closed to all traffic in 1936 and the track lifted during the War, but has been entirely rebuilt and even extended. Starting from Caernarfon in 1997, the final section (from Pont Croesor) was connected in 2009, with regular passenger services resuming in 2011.  Buildings  The present stone buildings date from 1878/79, replacing earlier wooden buildings dismantled and reused elsewhere on the railway. The goods shed was added in 1880. The buildings were linked by a major extension in 1975. Passenger facilities include a booking and enquiry office, a large tourist and hobby shop, and a restaurant with licensed bar. The erection of the platform awning was completed in 1988. Harbour Station is the head office and operational headquarters of the Festiniog Railway Company, marketed as Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways.  Operations  With the resumption of services in 1955, all traffic on the line has been controlled from an office in Harbour station, known simply as \\"Control\\". With the exception of some early morning and late night movements by works trains, this office is manned constantly when passenger-carrying services are in operation. Its remit was expanded in 1997 with the commencement of public services on the Welsh Highland Railway between Caernarfon and Dinas and its subsequent expansion south towards Porthmadog. Additionally, for 2007 and 2008, when a connection was in use with the WHR(P), there was a requirement to coordinate with its operations on the new main line. From 2011, with the WHR now connected to the station via the CTRL, a new short platform and point work was added to the eastward side of the existing platform structure/Spooners Bar. This being too short to hold the longer WHR trains, WHR trains were pulled onto the Cob; then a pilot locomotive was attached to the rear to drag the complete WHR train into the station. This operation was reversed on departure, and because of the need for both lines to use the Cob and the single platform, only one train could be in the station at any time. This was always a temporary solution, until funds could be found to rebuild the station. Having foreseen this problem, the FR proposed a ¬£1.3M rebuild of Harbour Station, to provide two separate and individually controllable platforms, each with their own run- round loops. The project took three years to complete, requiring extension of the Cob structure into the Irish Sea, compacting, extension of the platform, and finally a shift westwards of the alignment of the existing single platform and FR storage loops and sidings. A helpful grant from the Terminal Stations Improvement Scheme was arranged by the Welsh Government. Completed in March 2014 within the projected cost,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west- wales-26706568 the project delivered, as well as two platforms, a new electronically controlled signal box with a distinct FR heritage appearance. The signalling work won the Signalling Award at the 2014 National Railway Heritage Awards.

History KRTP-86 Tamara on Tatra T815 in Military Museum Le≈°any Development of Tamara by the state-run company Tesla in Pardubice began in 1981 and continued until 1983. Tests of a mobile system began in September 1984 through to 1985. It was finally deployed in 1987 following acceptance tests in October of that year. In 1991 the baseline KRTP-86 Tamara was superseded in production by improved the KRTP-91 Tamara-M. Appearance Unlike its predecessors, Tamara was a mobile system deployed on eight large Tatra T815 trucks and mounted upon a powerful 25 m hydraulic mast. Setup was completely automated and claimed to be of the order of twenty minutes from the moment of arrival at a site. Mode of operation The deployed system typically comprises a central site (containing the signal processing equipment and an ESM receiver) and two or three side sites containing only an ESM receiver. The side sites relay the signals received to the central site over a point-to-point microwave link. The central site uses the known propagation delay from the side sites to estimate the TDOA of the pulses at each site. The TDOA of a pulse between one side site and the central site locates the target on a hyperboloid. A second side site provides a second TDOA and hence a second hyperboloid. The intersection of these two hyperboloids places the target on a line, providing a 2D measurement of the target's location (no height). A third site provides a third hyperboloid and hence a measurement of height. Tamara could automatically track 23 radar and 48 IFF targets simultaneously. Its frequency band is 0.8-18 GHz. The nominal range of the system is 450 km, and it is generally limited by the radio horizon. It provides surveillance over a sector of approximately 100 degrees, with the later KRTP-91 system offering a wider 120 degree sector of surveillance. Exports Tesla built a total of 23 units, with 15 KRTP-86 Tamara and 4 KRTP-91 Tamara-M units exported to the former Soviet Union, as well as a single KRTP-86 Tamara unit to the German Democratic Republic. The East German Tamara unit was used by the Bundeswehr after the German Reunification until 2010. Related systems Tamara was the successor of the Kop√°ƒç and Ramona. It has been succeeded by the VERA family of sensors.

The case involved a club in which couples engaged in group sex; the club was alleged to be a \\"common bawdy-house\\" (a house in which indecency or prostitution occurs). The acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court. Background In 1997, James Kouri, the owner of the Montreal club Coeur √† Corps, was accused of operating a common bawdy-house and fined $7,500CBC News, \\"Swingers clubs don't harm society, top court rules,\\" December 21, 2005, URL accessed 23 December 2005. under section 210(1) of the Criminal Code. The fine came after undercover investigations of the club by police that started in 1996, although the club had been established in 1985. The group sex club was for couples who, upon entering, would be asked if they were a \\"liberated couple.\\" Only those who replied in the affirmative could enter, and the couples would have to pay an entrance fee. On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, Mr. Kouri was acquitted. Decision The majority of the Supreme Court upheld the acquittal. As the test for defining indecency, necessary in order to answer whether Mr. Kouri was guilty of operating a bawdy-house, was set out in R v Labaye, the Court in R v Kouri concentrated on whether sufficient measures were taken by Mr. Kouri so that the public was not exposed to something they would not want to see. Had Mr. Kouri not done so, he might have been guilty of indecency. The Court took the view that the Crown did not effectively prove its case against Mr. Kouri. As the Court argued, the Crown had no evidence of anyone being forced to watch the sexual activities in the club, nor of anyone in the club being surprised to see group sex. Whether a couple was a \\"liberated couple\\" was viewed as a \\"sufficiently clear and comprehensive\\" means to ensure only knowing and willing couples would enter, given the context of the outside of the club, which had sexually-themed images present. It thus did not matter that there was no explicit cautionary message at the entrance that sexual conduct might be seen inside. The Crown had also pushed its case against Mr. Kouri by saying that it was not known whether every couple was asked if they were \\"liberated\\" before they were admitted, and indeed some of the police had not been asked that question when they had entered the bar. The police corroborated the evidence that not every couple was asked this with the anecdote that a woman once left the club \\"upset with her partner\\". The Court responded to these concerns by noting that the fact that this woman became upset does not mean she was surprised to see sexual conduct in the club; there are other possible reasons for her unhappiness. Even if she was unhappy to see group sex when the activity actually occurred, that does not prove she had not agreed to see this activity in the first place. Moreover, while some police were not asked the \\"liberated couple\\" question, that did not prove that all other couples were not asked the question the first time they came to the club. Mr. Kouri might also have been guilty of indecency had the club encouraged degrading views of certain people. The Court, however, found no evidence that Mr. Kouri was guilty of this, noting that the activity was consensual and no money was exchanged between the persons having sex. While there was an entrance fee, this was not paid to anyone for a sexual service, but rather to enter the club to use the bar and engage in sexual activity with others.

Owned by Rogers Media, the station broadcasts a sports talk format branded as Sportsnet 960 The Fan, co-branded with the Sportsnet television channel also owned by Rogers. Its studios are located on 7th Avenue Southwest in downtown Calgary, in the same building as Rogers' other Calgary stations, CFFR, CHFM and CJAQ. CFAC broadcasts with a power of 50,000 watts 24 hours a day on the regional frequency of 960 AM. The daytime signal is non-directional, and the nighttime signal is directional using a three-tower array located on Rainbow Road just east of the Calgary city limits. CFAC is currently the only Canadian station broadcasting on 960 AM, although the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has approved a new station on 960 AM in Mississauga, Ontario (near Toronto). Programming CFAC is the radio flagship for broadcasts of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (play-by-play by Derek Wills, colour by Peter Loubardias) and the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (play-by-play by Brad Curle, colour by Ken Thrower). It also features live coverage of Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays and select games of the National Football League. History Organized radio broadcasting began to gain prominence in Canada in early 1922. Initially there wasn't a formal licence category for stations providing entertainment broadcasts intended for the general public, so the earliest stations operated under a mixture of Experimental, Amateur, and governmental authorizations. One of the most prominent pioneer broadcasters was William Walter Westover Grant, who during this time installed radio communication equipment for the Canadian Air Board's Forestry patrol.\\"W.W.W. 'Bill' Grant (1892-1968)\\" by J. Lyman Potts, Canadian Communications Foundation, March 1997 (broadcasting-history.ca) In 1921 these operations were established at the High River Air Station in southern Alberta.\\"Forest Fire Air Patrols Observe Million Sq. Miles\\" by Chester A. Bloom, Calgary Daily Herald, October 29, 1921, page 26. Grant constructed government station VAW at this site, and, in addition to the forestry work, began to make a series of experimental entertainment broadcasts, believed to be the first in western Canada, that were audible approximately 50 miles (80 km) away in Calgary. (In May 1922 Grant founded CFCN (now CKMX) in Calgary.) In the spring of 1922 the Calgary Herald began to publicize the topic of radio, including Grant's broadcasts.\\"Radio Telephone Concert For the Canadian Club, Calgary Daily Herald, April 6, 1922, page 9. In late April the newspaper installed what it called \\"the most complete receiving set in Western Canada\\" at its headquarters, and reported that it had successfully picked up High River concerts on April 27\\"Herald's Radio Receiving Set in Use\\", Calgary Daily Herald, April 28, 1922, page 1. and April 28.\\"Herald's Second Radio Test Satisfactory\\", Calgary Daily Herald, April 29, 1922, page 1. During this same time the Canadian government announced the formal creation of a radio broadcast service, which included the establishment of a \\"Private Commercial Broadcasting\\" licence.\\"Fees For Examinations and Licenses\\", Report of the Department of the Naval Service for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 1922 (June 30, 1922), page 27. In late April 1922 an initial group of twenty-three commercial broadcasting station licences was announced, including one issued to the Herald for operation on 400 meters (750 kHz), with the randomly assigned call letters of CHCQ.\\"Radio Department: Broadcasting Stations\\", Winnipeg Evening Tribune, April 25, 1922, page 5. (In this list, CKCE Toronto should be 450 instead of 45 meters, and for Winnipeg, \\"CHCE\\" should be CHCF and \\"CKbC\\" should be CKZC.) CHCQ's transmitter and studio were located in room 1006 on the tenth floor of The Herald Building. The primary technical work was performed by G. J. J. Jermain and S. H. Sturrork, assisted by W. W. Grant at the High River station.\\"Board of Trade President Formally Opens the Herald Radio Broadcasting Station\\", Calgary Daily Herald, May 3, 1922, page 1, continued on page 8. This account states, apparently erroneously, that the new station's call sign was \\"CQCA\\", although all other accounts from this period, both before and after this date, listed the call letters as \\"CHCQ\\". The first test transmission began at 2 o'clock on May 1, after the transmitter vacuum tubes had arrived that morning, and the next day's paper reported that \\"very gratifying success was obtained\\". Programming included phonograph records plus singing and the playing of a violin by Margaret King of the Palace theatre orchestra.\\"First Broadcasting Tests on the Herald Radio Phone Provide Agreeable Results\\", Calgary Daily Herald, May 2, 1922, page 1, continued on page 9. The Herald announced the formal station opening would take place at 8:30 the evening of May 2, beginning with a speech by Frank Freeze, president of the Calgary Board of Trade.\\"Frank Freeze, President of the Calgary Board of Trade, to Open Herald Broadcasting Station Tonight\\", Calgary Daily Herald, May 2, 1922, page 1.

The April 1922 initial list of commercial broadcasting station grants had also included a second Calgary station, licensed to George M. Bell and transmitting on 430 meters (698 kHz), with the randomly assigned call sign of CFAC. On August 26 it was announced that the Herald was taking over operation of CFAC\\"The Herald's New Two Kilowatt Broadcating Station C.F.A.C.\\", Calgary Daily Herald, August 26, 1922, page 1. as a second, more powerful station. This was in addition to CHCQ, as the announcement noted \\"The set used during the past four months will not be discarded but is bring installed in the new quarters and will be used in case of accident with the larger machine, thus assuring a continuity of service.\\"\\"Herald's Powerful Broadcaster to Operate Tuesday\\", Calgary Daily Herald, August 26, 1922, page 7.

Until December 13, 1922 both CFAC and CHCQ were listed,\\"Herald Radio Today\\", Calgary Daily Herald, December 13, 1922, page 1. but beginning the next day only CFAC appeared.\\"Herald Radio Today\\", Calgary Daily Herald, December 14, 1922, page 1. Information on CHCQ's fate is limited, although one later review stated that the station closed sometime in 1924.\\"Early Canadian Broadcasting Records\\" by Weston Wrigley (reprinted from the October 1941 issue of the Canadian Radio Data Book) (hammondmuseumofradio.org) On May 1, 1923 the Herald presented a special program \\"in celebration of the first anniversary of CFAC\\", and its historical review combined the earlier broadcasts of CHCQ with those of CFAC that started in August, with a sidebar noting \\"Before the present radio station of The Herald was built, this set, that was known then as CHCQ, was use to entertain the fans.\\"\\"Herald Radio to Celebrate First Anniversary Tuesday With Exceptional Programme\\", Calgary Daily Herald, April 28, 1923, page 6. Taylor, Pearson & Carson, a company which would eventually become Selkirk Communications, became a minority partner in CFAC in 1934. The station was a private affiliate of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, which became the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 1936. The station lost its CBC affiliation in 1948, when the CBC launched CBX to serve both Edmonton and Calgary from a Lacombe transmitter site. Selkirk became the station's sole owner in 1971, and was acquired by Maclean-Hunter in 1989, which in turn was bought out by Rogers Radio in 1994. Like most early radio stations, CFAC changed frequencies a number of times. Under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement it moved to its current frequency assignment of 960 kHz in early 1941.Canadian station assignments by frequency (Arrangement between the United States of America, Canada, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Mexico, comprising recommendations of the North American Regional Radio-Engineering Meeting (supplemental to North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, Habana, 1937). Signed at Washington January 30, 1941; effective March 29, 1941, pages 1408-1410) In 1983, CFAC launched CFHC in Canmore to re-broadcast its programs, a practice that continued until 1992. In 2001, CFAC dropped the country music format which had been the station's staple for decades and adopted its current sports format, initially as an affiliate of CHUM Limited's The Team sports network. When the Team network was discontinued in 2002, CFAC retained sports programming but was rebranded as The Fan. Logo from January to October 2011 Mike Richards in the Morning, running from 6am-10am local time weekdays, was one of the most popular shows on Calgary radio. It often featured fake phone calls, skits and songs (all performed by Richards) from or about local and international sports celebrities. As of 2010, according to BBM's recently introduced PPM ratings, the program became the highest rated sports morning show in the country. However, in January 2011 Richards left The Fan to pursue a job as morning host with TSN Radio 1050 back in his native Ontario. His program was replaced with a show co-hosted by ex-Calgary Flames player Rhett Warrener. As of August 2008, The Fan was ranked 15th among Calgary radio stations with only a %1.9 share of the audience,BBM Canada Radio Statistics arguably due to the niche market of the all-sports AM format. As of the Fall 2011 BBM Radio PPM Data, CFAC was still ranked #15, but increased its share to 3.1. On March 17, 2009 it was announced on \\"The Big Show\\" that The Fan 960 would be dropping the ESPN Radio affiliation and picking up the market's Fox Sports Radio affiliation, which occurred the week of March 23, 2009, although the station later returned to ESPN. In January 2011, CFAC became known as \\"Sportsnet Radio Fan 960\\", the move came as part of a co-branding initiative with its television counterpart Rogers Sportsnet, amid indications that rival TSN was preparing to launch a competing sports radio network, which launched shortly after in Toronto. The station's on-air identity was then changed to \\"Sportsnet 960 The Fan\\" in October 2011.

Martinsons is a leading authority on strategic management, organizational change, and knowledge management/information systems. His research and insights have been published widely in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Russian and Spanish as well as English. Martinsons has researched the strategic management of competitive enterprises in uncertain business environments as well as the diagnosis, planning and implementation of transformational organizational change. The level of analysis in his studies has ranged from individuals (top management decision making) and small groups (knowledge management systems) to organisations (business performance management, links between business strategy and information technology/systems) and entire industries and economies (strategic intelligence in pre-handover Hong Kong, post-Soviet reform in Latvia, e-commerce in 21st century China). Martinsons also pioneered the research of both green business issues (sustainable development and environmental technologies) and information ethics in the context of Hong Kong and China.

Maurice Herman Finkel (1888‚Äì1949) was an American architect and Yiddish theater actor, known for buildings designed in and near Detroit, Michigan, where he had his career. Born in Bessarabia, part of the Russian Empire, he immigrated to New York City as a child with his family. There he performed for a time in the Yiddish theater. He moved to Detroit, Michigan after getting his architecture degree in New York, and made his career at a time of great growth in the city. He designed more than 200 buildings, including grand movie palaces, apartments and houses, and commercial structures. Three of his buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Biography He was born in Bessarabia, Russian Empire in 1888 to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. His first language was Yiddish. They immigrated to the United States when he was a child, settling in New York City. He attended local public schools, where he learned English. He also became involved with Yiddish theater, which was very active while he was growing up. He acted in several plays. At the same time he was busy with advanced studies, and received an architecture degree from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in Manhattan, New York in 1913. Finkel moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he began his architecture career in 1915. The city was described as a boom town, growing rapidly along the auto industry. He designed more than 200 structures, from apartment buildings and houses, to help accommodate the increased population, to a great variety of commercial and entertainment buildings, including movie theaters. His works include what is now known as the Ossian H. Sweet House, built in 1919; the 1,700-seat Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which opened in 1928; and the Michigan Theatre in Jackson, Michigan, which opened in 1930. Each of these buildings is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Finkel married and had a family. His son is George Finkel, a TV sports producer, and three-time Emmy winner.

In 1997 the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 entitled \\"Reporting Comprehensive Income\\". This statement required all income statement items to be reported either as a regular item in the income statement or a special item as other comprehensive income. It is commonly referred to as FAS130. The International Accounting Standards Board issued the International Accounting Standard 1 with a slightly different terminology but an conceptually identical meaning. Comprehensive income Comprehensive income (IAS 1: \\"Total Comprehensive Income\\") is the total non- owner change in equity for a reporting period. This change encompasses all changes in equity other than transactions from owners and distributions to owners. Most of these changes appear in the income statement. A few special types of gains and losses are not shown in the income statement but as special items in shareholder equity section of the balance sheet. Since these comprehensive income items are not closed to retained earnings each period they accumulate as shareholder equity items and thus are entitled \\"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\\" and is sometimes referred to as \\"AOCI\\". Accumulated other comprehensive income is a subsection in equity where \\"other comprehensive income\\" is accumulated (summed or \\"aggregated\\"). The balance of AOCI is presented in the Equity section of the Balance Sheet as is the Retained Earnings balance, which aggregates past and current Earnings, and past and current Dividends. Other comprehensive income Other comprehensive income is the difference between net income as in the income statement (profit or loss Account) and comprehensive income, and represents the certain gains and losses of the enterprise not recognized in the P&L; Account. It is commonly referred to as \\"OCI\\" although the word comprehensive has no meaning as can be seen from the definitory equation. OCI when translated into another language and back into English means \\"other income\\" only. In practice, it comprises the following items: # Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities [IAS 39/ \\"FAS 115\\" ‚Äì \\"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt Securities\\"] # Gains and losses on derivatives held as cash flow hedges (only for effective portions) [IAS 39/ \\"FAS 133\\" ‚Äì \\"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\\"] # Gains and losses resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries (from foreign currency to the presentation currency) [IAS 21/ \\"FAS 52\\" ‚Äì \\"Foreign Currency Translation\\"], # Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans recognized (Minimum pension liability adjustments) [IAS 19/ \\"FAS 158\\" ‚Äì \\"Employers' Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension And Other Postretirement Plans\\"] # Changes in the revaluation surplus [IAS 16 and IAS 38]. While the AOCI balance is presented in Equity section of the balance sheet, the annual accounting entries, as flows, are presented sometimes in a Statement of Comprehensive Income. This statement expands the traditional income statement beyond earnings to include OCI in order to present comprehensive income. Under the revised IAS 1, all non-owner changes in equity (comprehensive income) must be presented either in one Statement of comprehensive income or in two statements (a separate income statement and a statement of comprehensive income). =Reclassification to profit or loss (P&L;)= Flows presented initially in OCI sometimes are reclassified into Earnings (Profit or Loss) when certain conditions are met. For the five types of OCI described above, the triggers for reclassification are presented in the accounting standard that gives rise to the OCI flow. =Alterations to definition of OCI= In the United States further alterations to this OCI definition occur when a new standard (including a revision of a previously issued accounting standard) identifies an item that can be measured, should be measured in the financial statements, represents a \\"flow\\" variable rather than a stock, or snapshot, variable, and does not represent a flow variable that should be presented in the Income Statement as a component of Earnings. The flow variable that is both measurable and should be recognized is then added to the list above of items that a reporting entity would include in AOCI. In the third quarter of 2008 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission received several proposals to allow the recognition in AOCI of certain fair value changes on financial instruments. This proposal was initially well received by representatives of the banking community who felt that Earnings recognition of these fair value changes during the concurrent \\"credit meltdown of 2008\\" would be inappropriate. The effect of this proposal, on balance, would be to remove sizeable losses from Earnings and thus Retained Earnings of banks, and assist them in preserving their regulatory capital. The regulatory capital of banks in the US and generally worldwide includes contributed equity capital and retained earnings but excludes AOCI, even though it is reported as a component of the Equity section of the Balance Sheet. The FASB released an Accounting Standards Update on January 5, 2016 that changes items reported in OCI. Previously, equity securities could be classified as available for sale, and unrecognized gains and losses on these securities appeared in OCI. However, per this update, there is no longer an available for sale classification for equity securities if the fair value of these securities can be readily determined. Changes in the fair value of equity investments in unconsolidated entities flow through earnings for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.https://www.pwc.com/us/en/cfodirect/publications/in-brief/fasb- classification-measurement-final-standard.html See also *Balance sheet *Comprehensive income *Hedge accounting *Reserve (accounting) *Statement of comprehensive income References Accounting in the United States ","title":"Accumulated other comprehensive income"},{"id":"3507781","text":"Bernard I of Baden (1364 - 5 April 1431, Baden) was Margrave of the Margraviate of Baden from 1391 to 1431.

Rudolf VII afterwards received the southern areas from Ettlingen via Rastatt to Baden-Baden, Bernard himself the areas around Durlach and Pforzheim. He had his family seat in the fortress of Hohenbaden high above the thermal baths of the town of Baden. During his reign he extended the castle from the underlying Gothic structure. On 25 July 1415, he purchased Hachberg, H√∂hingen, Ober-Usenberg and the town of Sulzburg in Upper Baden for to Otto II, the last margrave of the eponymous collateral line. During this time he had many disputes with the towns of Strasbourg, Speyer and with king Ruprecht I. His successor Jacob I further expanded the castle into a fortress.

The piece is narrated by an awkward outcast attending a Christmas party. He observes the party's guest of honour and takes special interest in one of the children.Magarshack, David, The Best Stories of Fyodor Dostoevsky, (New York: The Modern Library, 2005), xi-xxvi Plot summary The narrator begins by mentioning to the reader that he had just been to a wedding but recalls a Christmas party that he had found more interesting. The party was given with the pretext of being a children's party, but its real purpose was for the wealthy host's family to talk business with rich members of the community. The wealthiest guest was Julian Mastakovich, a rotund landowner. Without anyone to talk to, the narrator fell to simply observing the guests. The narrator takes particular interest in the children. They were given gifts in accordance with their social standing. The eleven-year-old daughter of a wealthy government contractor received an expensive doll, while the poorest child, the son of the family governess, received only a small book without illustrations or even a front and back cover. After being bullied by the other richer boys, the poor boy retreats to another room where he and the rich daughter play happily with the doll. Julian Matsakovich also retreats from the rest of the crowd to observe the rich daughter, who already had a dowry set aside of 300,000 rubles. As Mastakovich observes the girl, he calculates what her dowry (with interest) would be at age sixteen, and he comes up with the astounding sum of 500,000 rubles. Mastakovich approaches the girl and kisses her on the head. The girl recoils from his gesture, and she looks to her playmate for protection. Mastakovich tries to scare the poor boy away while trying to get a promise of love from the young girl, and eventually he causes a scene where he chases the poor boy around the party, whipping at him with his handkerchief. The wedding that the narrator came across five years later was indeed the wedding between Julian Mastakovich and the rich girl, now sixteen .

With the help of the engineer George Parfitt he built one of Britain‚Äôs first petrol-powered motor vehicles, Frederick Bremer of Walthamstow having built the first in 1892. On 17 October 1895, with his assistant James Pullinger, they drove through Farnham, Surrey, whereupon he was prosecuted for using a locomotive with neither a licence nor a man walking in front with a red flag. This is sometimes misreported as the first person to be convicted of speeding in the UK, but that sobriquet subsequently fell to Walter Arnold of East Peckham, Kent, in January 1896.On 28 January 1896 Walter Arnold, of East Peckham Kent, was fined for speeding at , thus exceeding the contemporary speed limit of . He was fined 1 shilling plus costs, the first speeding fine in England. Knight was both an inventor and pioneer, having created a (failed) steam powered road vehicle; a renowned steam powered hop digger; a heat saving radiator; a brick laying machine; a grenade thrower, a speedometer, wooden vehicle tyres, and a patent 'dish lever' for tilting plates when carving meat. Knight was a founder member of the Automobile Association and politically active in the repeal of the Red Flag Act, he was also a pioneer of colour photography, plus writing various factual and practical books. Family and early life John Henry Knight tricycle John Henry Knight was born in 1847 to John Knight, a banker and brewer of Farnham, who died in 1856 when John Henry was 9 years old. His mother was Mary Knight. His father's will bequeathed him title to, among other things, 'The Anchor Inn, Normandy' when he was 21 years old. He was born and raised at Weybourne House, Weybourne, Farnham, Surrey, which still stands today. He then moved to Barfield in Runfold, just outside Farnham, which is now a Preparatory school (whose alumni include Mike Hawthorn). He was inspired by The Great Exhibition of 1851 and went on to train as an engineer, developing an early enthusiasm for steam powered road-going transport. He owned an engineering works on West Street, Farnham. Early motoring In 1895 Knight built one of Britain‚Äôs first petrol-powered motor vehicles, a three- wheeled, two-seater contraption with a top speed of only . It was \\"The first petroleum carriage for two people made in England\\" and believed to be the fourth British vehicle to be built plus the 'first petrol driven vehicle ever to be driven on British roads'. Known as the Trusty, it had a single cylinder Trusty 1,565cc engine. Sources such as British Local History state that : > The car was designed very much as an experiment in order to attract Police > attention and therefore create public awareness of the many restrictions > which prevented the use of motor carriages in Britain at that time. Knight > managed to use the vehicle for some 150 miles on public roads, before being > stopped by the Police. On 17 October 1895 Knight‚Äôs assistant, James Pullinger, was stopped in Castle Street, Farnham, by the Superintendent of Police and a crowd had gathered by the time Knight arrived. The Superintendent asked whether it was a steam engine, Knight replied that it was not and thus admitted liability. He and Pullinger were charged with using a locomotive without a licence. The case was heard at 'Farnham Petty Sessions' held at Farnham Town Hall on 31 October 1895. Knight and Pullinger were both fined half a crown 2s 6d (or possibly 5 shillings) plus 10 shillings costs (or possibly 12s 6d). Knight was restricted to using the car only on farm roads until the Locomotive Act was replaced by the Locomotives on the Highway Act, on 14 November 1896. His action was later also responsible for the repeal of the notorious Red Flag legislation. Knight's vehicle was said to be \\"almost silent\\" when it was running; the vehicle entered a limited production run in 1896 and shortly after that the tricycle was the only British car at the 1896 Horseless Carriage display at Crystal Palace, although the design was later changed in favour of a four wheel version. The car is currently on display at the National Motor Museum. Knight was a founder member of the Automobile Club of Great Britain, so the members first ever 'club run' was hosted at his Barfield home. Other inventions and pioneering activities John Henry Knight Steam vehicle, circa 1868 Although best remembered for his car and his driving, he had, for many years, been an inventor and a designer of steam-powered machines, which he used for agricultural work and early road transport. =Steam powered road vehicle= In 1868 he built a steam powered road vehicle, although it was not a practical proposition due to inefficiency. John Henry Knight's steam powered hop digging machine, circa 1872 =Steam powered Hop digging machine= In 1872 Knight developed a steam powered hop digging machine. A rival designer, Frank Proctor, stated in an 1890 edition of the weekly magazine \\"Engineering\\" that \\"Mr Knight has undoubtedly earned the distinction of being one of the early pioneers in the system of steam digging\\". He had begun developing his first digging machine in 1872, specifically for working in hopfields, which are difficult to cultivate due to the incidence of the hop poles which support the strings up which the plants climb. \\"Digging by Steam\\" by Colin Tyler (published in 1977 by Argus Books Ltd) devotes a chapter to hop digging machines, many of which were designed and built by Knight, and which are illustrated with drawings or photos. =Other inventions= The former Elliot Works on Farnham's West Street where Knight's petrol driven vehicle was built in 1895 His other inventions included - * Knight's Thermosote Heat Saving Radiator, for which patents were applied for; * a brick laying machine; a wall that it built still stands at Barfield School in Runfold, but the machine's main flaw was an inability to turn/build corners. * a grenade thrower, * a speedometer, * wooden vehicle tyres, * Knight's patent 'dish lever' for tilting plates when carving meat. =Photography= He was a keen photographer and pioneer of early colour photography, photographing Farnham and the surrounding countryside in the early years of the 20th century. =Writing= His publications included : * Electric Light for Country Houses * Reminiscences of a Country Town * Notes on Motor Carriages with Hints for Purchasers and Users.

If the asset is impaired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the revaluation gain or loss implicit in the transaction is recognised as an income or expense. Starting in 2018, this treatment will be overridden by IFRS 9, according to which, for equity instruments, the revaluation gain or loss will be recognized under Other Comprehensive Income whether it be due to normal market fluctuations or impairment.

Large numbers of dice are needed to resolve combat and shooting.Warhammer Ancient Battles, 1998, p27 Development Several of Games Workshop's staff had begun experimenting with using Warhammer rules to play historical gamesWarhammer Ancient Battles p2 before Warhammer Ancient Battles was written, and Wargames Illustrated magazine included some articles that had been written on the subject. This led to the development of Warhammer Ancient Battles as a spare- time project.Slingshot July 1998 p11 It was published under the name \\"Warhammer Historical Wargames.\\" Based as it was on Warhammer Fantasy, Warhammer Ancient Battles served as a bridge for fantasy wargamers to discover historical wargaming but also attracted wargamers who had never played the fantasy version.Slingshot March 2010 p25 Games Workshop eventually brought the project back in-house, with Rob Broom running the Warhammer Historical Wargames department that promoted an increasing number of books. To accusations that the rules were only a throwback to an earlier era of wargaming, Jervis Johnson pleaded guilty. The rules, he said, were intended to be fun and informal, rather than dominated by requirements of super-detailed historical accuracy. And, the designers had rejected the approach of contemporary rule sets as being too abstract.Slingshot July 1998 p12 The game rules were heavily based on the fifth edition of Warhammer, with magic dropped and more detail added for ancient weapons and formations. The two games have developed in different directions since. Modifications to the core rules have been included in some of the more recent supplements. The WAB 2nd edition consciously took the rules even further from its fantasy origins.Slingshot March 2010 p25 Following the success of Warhammer Ancient Battles Warhammer Historical branched out into other areas: *Warhammer English Civil War *Legends of the Old West *Warmaster Ancients - the application of the epic scale rules for Warhammer Fantasy to non-fantasy armies  Rules  The rules are written for individually based figures and this approach was in marked contrast to the element based rulesets current amongst ancient historical wargames when the rules were first published.Slingshot July 1998 p37 Standard bearers, musicians and officer figures are given specific advantages - seen by some as giving the rules more character.Slingshot July 1998 p36 =Second edition= A second edition ruleset was released in April 2010, written by Martin GibbinsWarhammer Ancient Battles, 2nd Edition, p2. The revision aimed to encourage linear battle formations and to make flank attacks easier.Slingshot March 2010 p25 Changes include allowing cavalry to make march rules despite infantry and capping bonus troops in melee for the number of ranks of the formation to 2.Wargames Illustrated July 2010, p114 The first edition had had some elements that derived from its origin as a fantasy set and the revision aimed to remove them. Hence, the influence of characters has been reduced.Slingshot March 2010 p25 Supplements The core rulebook includes army lists for \\"Early Imperial Roman\\" and \\"Barbarian\\" armies. A range of supplementary books has been released to provide more army lists, each focusing on a particular period and place. * Armies of Antiquity. Released soon after the rulebook, this was intended to help players get started, by providing a large number of basic summary army lists. Many of the lists have been superseded by later supplements. * Chariot Wars. Covers armies of the ancient civilisations in the Near East, and Trojan War. * Fall of the West. Covers Roman and Barbarian armies of the 4th-5th centuries. * Shieldwall. Covers the British Isles, France and Scandinavia in the Dark Ages. * El Cid. Covers the Spanish Reconquista in the 10th-13th centuries. * Alexander the Great. The armies of Alexander the Great and his enemies. * Armies of Chivalry. Designed to extend Warhammer Ancient Battles to a slightly later medieval period, this includes new rules as well as a set of summary army lists covering Europe in the 14th-16th centuries. * Spartacus. Based around a campaign following Spartacus' slave revolt. * Byzantium : Beyond the Golden Gate. Covers the Byzantine Empire from 6th-12th centuries. * Hannibal and the Punic Wars. Covers the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage in the 3rd-2nd centuries BC. * Vlad the Impaler. Covers the general time and region of the Ottoman Turks. * The Art of War. Details the armies of Chinese history and prehistory, as well as those of its neighbours at the time (such as the Hsiung-nu), up until the Three Kingdoms era. * Age of Arthur. Features armies from Sub-Roman Britain. * Siege and Conquest. This features rules for raids, sieges and settlements. It does not include any army lists though it does include things that can be added to the armies derived from the lists in the other books. The reviewer in Wargames Illustrated considered a key feature of this supplement in that it facilitates battles that take more varied forms than a simple head to head battle.Wargames IllustratedNo 242 Community The game was supported by a high-traffic discussion group on Yahoo! Groups, the WABlist, and Warhammer Historical Forums (the former a non-Yahoo message board). In addition another group WABMedievalBattles focused on the medieval period.

Water released after power generation at Gandhi Sagar dam, Rana Pratap Sagar dam and Jawahar Sagar Dams, is diverted by Kota Barrage for irrigation in Rajasthan and in Madhya Pradesh through canals on the left and the right sides of the river. The work on this dam was completed in 1960.  Structure  The total catchment area of Kota Barrage is 27,332 km2, of which the free catchment area below Jawahar Sagar Dam is just 137 km2. The live storage is 99 million cubic metres. It is an earthfill dam with a concrete spillway. The right and left main canals have a headworks discharge capacity of 188 and 42 m3/s, respectively. The total length of the main canals, branches and distribution system is about 2,342 km, serving an area of 2,290 km2 of CCA.Chambal Valley Project 50% of the water intercepted at Kota Barrage has been agreed to be diverted to Madhya Pradesh for irrigation. The barrage operates 19 gates to control flow of flood and canal water downstream, and serves as bridge between parts of Kota on both side of the river.  Tourism  The massive flow/froth of water during opening of gates in monsoon season -- and accompanying vibration of bridge -- are particular attraction among locals. Though in past, mis- or non- communication about the discharge of water to residents near river bank has resulted in the loss of lives of people engaged in swimming or washing activities downstream. Other places worth visiting nearby include Kansua temple with a four faced Shiva Lingam, Bhitria Kund, Adhar Shila, Budh Singh Bafna Haveli and Yatayat Park.

He was one of the longest-serving members of the Victorian State Parliament, spending eighteen years as a Member of the Legislative Council, nine of them on the front bench. Houghton is remembered for his work cleaning up HM Prison Pentridge and the Yarra River. Life Houghton was born in Melbourne, the son of solicitor William Sharwood Houghton and Doris Thackery. He attended Melbourne Grammar School and spent a year at the University of Melbourne studying law, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. At the time he had also been working as an articled clerk in his father's law firm, Mills, Oakley and McKay. From 1940 until 1945 he served in the Australian Imperial Force, earning promotion to the rank of Lieutenant in 1942. When he returned to Australia in 1945, he decided not to return to the law, instead setting up as a farmer near Yarra Glen. In 1948, he married Audrey Gourlay. After retiring from politics in 1985, Houghton concentrated on his family and his work as a farmer. He died in 2001, eight days after his eightieth birthday. At Houghton's funeral, former Victorian Premier Lindsay Thompson praised him for his conservation work, telling mourners that \\"That probably proved to be the best $6 million the government spent that year because [Labor planning minister] Evan Walker took up the project and Southbank is now one of Melbourne's great assets.\\" The funeral was held 16 January 2001 in St Peter's Chapel, at Melbourne Grammar. The \\"Vasey Houghton Bridge,\\" a bridge on the Melba Highway across the Yarra River, was named in his honour and opened on 23 January 1999. Political career In 1967, Houghton ran for the Victorian Legislative Council, obtaining a seat in the new Templestowe Province. He served on the Council for fifteen years, and in that time was Minister for Social Welfare (1973); Health (1976‚Äì1979); and, from 1980 to 1985, the portfolios of Conservation, Lands, and Soldier Settlement. He was also Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet before moving onto Social Welfare. Today, Houghton is best-remembered for his work cleaning up HM Prison Pentridge and the Yarra River. As Minister for Social Welfare, he successfully worked to abolish \\"C\\" division of the gaol, which at the time was known as the \\"Hell division\\". He told reporters at the time, \\"Prisoners are not rough, tough hooligans. Most of the occupants of prison are inadequate, pitiful people.\\" In 1980 he was appointed chairman of a parliamentary committee to investigate pollution in the Yarra River and the possible cleanup of what he described as the \\"depressed, ramshackle buildings\\" along the southern bank of the river. As a result of his work, the Victorian Government spent six million Australian dollars cleaning up the area.

Andrew Jackson Zilker (1858‚Äì1934) was a political figure and philanthropist in Austin, Texas, after whom Zilker Park was named. He was the last private owner of Barton Springs. Biography Andrew Zilker was born in New Albany, Indiana. In his youth he'd read Henderson King Yoakum's two-volume History of Texas,Full title: \\"History of Texas from Its First Settlement in 1685 to Its Annexation to the United States in 1846\\" (1855) and was inspired to head for its capital to make his fortune. In 1876, at the age of 18, he arrived in Austin with fifty cents in his pocket, immediately acquired work as a dishwasher, and doubled his money by shift's end. His next job would be on the construction of the Congress Avenue Bridge. But the real money to be made in the Texas heat, he discovered, was in the manufacture of ice, and he quickly climbed the ladder from new hire to foreman for one icemaker in a matter of months. He was quick to learn the value of business connections, joining Austin Lodge #201 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks shortly after its founding in 1891. Soon he owned an ice plant of his own outright, and in 1901 began buying land between the Colorado River and Barton Creek. He had soon acquired 350 acres (1.4 km¬≤) surrounding Barton Springs, including the Springs themselves from John Rabb, and used the land to pasture the horses and mules that pulled his ice wagons, and the clear, clean Barton Springs water to make the ice itself. There he also built a small concrete pool and amphitheater for members of his Elks Club organization at the site of one of the three springs. Zilker also found the time to be a volunteer fireman, Director of the First National Bank, Water and Light Commissioner, and served both as alderman from the old Tenth Ward and president of the Travis County School Board. He would own a variety of businesses, including a brickyard (perhaps to spite his rival neighbor, and brickmaker, Michael Butler This website cites ), a wood and coal concern, and the water supply systems in Llano and Taylor. He even became the first Coca- Cola bottler in Austin. The year was 1917 when, in his role as head of the school board, he cut a curious deal giving Barton Springs, and, over the next seventeen years, the surrounding acres, to the Public Free Schools of Austin (i.e. the school district) to sell to the city, which in turn paid for a $100,000 school endowment with the proceeds. This trust fund still pays for what is known today as the school-to-work program. In 1950, nearly two decades after Zilker's death, the district opened Zilker Elementary in his honor. The area itself, of course, became Zilker Metropolitan Park. He is also remembered for his disdain for Austin mayor A. P. Wooldridge, and for encouraging Tom Miller to enter municipal politics and run for mayor in 1933. Nicknamed \\"the Colonel\\", Zilker's contribution to Austin was quite substantial.

The station lies off the B4410 former turnpike road from Maentwrog to Llanfrothen and Beddgelert, which the railway crosses on a fine cast-iron skew bridge (made at Boston Lodge foundry in 1854 and surmounted by 'gothic' balustrades). Tan-y-Bwlch is at a height of . and at a distance of just under from Porthmadog.  Hafod y Llyn  Extract from the 1962 OS one-inch map showing the section of line from Tan-y-Bwlch to Blaenau Ffestiniog From 1863 until 1873, the only regular passing station for trains was at the former horse stage at Hafod y Llyn, a few hundred yards down route (south-west) from Tan-y-Bwlch. Hafod y Llyn opened for passengers on 6 January 1865 but was very difficult of access. It is just over from Porthmadog, and horses were changed there from 1836 to 1863 as well as at several other lineside stables. There is little to see of the location now, apart from a widening of the formation, and a gate into the woods.  History  Hafod y Llyn was replaced by the new station at Tan-y-Bwlch, which opened in July 1873 and closed to passengers on 15 September 1939. Passenger service to Tan-y-Bwlch was resumed on 5 April 1958, and the station was the terminus of the railway until was reopened in 1968. However, Tan-y-Bwlch continued as the main station for the upper part of the line for years afterwards, as Dduallt had very limited facilities and no road access.  Station house  Mr and Mrs Will Jones have long been associated with Tan-y-Bwlch station. They lived in the station house from their marriage in 1929 to their retirement in 1968. In the 1930s and again in the 1950s and 1960s, the late Bessie Jones gained world-wide fame as the station-mistress wearing traditional Welsh costume and serving teas in the station house. Will Jones was a well-respected track man and passed on some of his skills to countless volunteers over the final 14 years of his employment. Bessie Jones (played none too sympathetically by Louie Emery) even appeared in Michael Powell's 1935 thriller The Phantom Light, which opens with an extended scene at the Station featuring the film's heroine, played by Binnie Hale.  Features and facilities  In addition to the station house, Tan-y-Bwlch has an original wooden station building, a modern water tank (built in the early 1990s) and a 1970s building intended as a signal box (now containing the telephone exchange and the relays for the automatic crossing equipment). The former stone built goods shed now serves as a shop, caf√© and information centre, with modern extensions housing kitchens and passenger amenities. Car parking and a picnic area are provided. The present footbridge provides access to the central platform, and replaces an earlier bridge, some away, which was on the original Roman road and in turn had replaced a level crossing. A feature of the station for many years was the long white paling fence observable in early photographs. This fence, 900 ft long, was recreated in 1970 by volunteers. The 89 ten-foot panels were replaced in 1995, and in late 2006 the entire fence was in turn replaced, again by volunteers, using 74 similar twelve-foot panels and new gates ‚Äì but creosoted, rather than painted. A reconstruction of 1999 is a static replica of the early-style slotted post semaphore signal that dominated the station in Victorian times. This early type of signal is no longer used on the Ffestiniog Railway, which now uses more modern equipment for train control. Tourist facilities include a nature trail through woodlands leading to Llyn Mair (\\"Mary's Lake\\") as well as longer signposted walks. There is also a play area at the station.

Entitled, ‚ÄòVornehmer Kaufmann mit seinem cirkassischen Sklaven‚Äô [Distinguished merchant and his circassian slave] by Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, ca. 1888. White slavery (also white slave trade or white slave trafficking) refers to the chattel slavery of Europeans, whether by non-Europeans (such as North Africans and the Muslim world), or by other Europeans (for example naval galley slaves or the Vikings' thralls). Slaves of European origin were present in ancient Rome and the Ottoman Empire. On the European continent under feudalism, there were various forms of status applying to people (such as serf, bordar, villein, vagabond and slave) who were indentured or forced to labor without pay. Under Muslim rule, the Arab slave trades that included Caucasian captives were often fueled by raids into European territories or were taken as children in the form of a blood tax from the families of citizens of conquered territories to serve the empire for a variety of functions. In the mid-19th century, the term 'white slavery' was used to describe the Christian slaves that were sold into the Barbary slave trade. The modern legal term applies more narrowly to sexual slavery, forced prostitution and human trafficking, with less focus on the race of victims or perpetrators. History The phrase \\"white slavery\\" was used by Charles Sumner in 1847 to describe the chattel slavery of Christians throughout the Barbary States and primarily in the Algiers, the capital of Ottoman Algeria. It also encompassed many forms of slavery, including the European concubines (Cariye) often found in Turkish harems. The term was also used by Clifford G. Roe from the beginning of the twentieth century to campaign against the forced prostitution and sexual slavery of girls who worked in Chicago brothels. Similarly, countries of Europe signed in Paris in 1904 an International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic aimed at combating the sale of women who were forced into prostitution in the countries of continental Europe. White slave trade =Slavic Slaves= East Slavic Camp by Sergei Ivanov (1913) The Volga trade route was established by the Varangians (Vikings) who settled in Northwestern Russia in the early 9th century. About south of the Volkhov River entry into Lake Ladoga, they established a settlement called Ladoga (Old Norse: Aldeigjuborg).Br√∏ndsted (1965), pp. 64-65 It connected Northern Europe and Northwestern Russia with the Caspian Sea, via the Volga River. The Rus used this route to trade with Muslim countries on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, sometimes penetrating as far as Baghdad. The route functioned concurrently with the Dnieper trade route, better known as the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, and lost its importance in the 11th century. Saqaliba originally was used to denote Slavic people, however later it came to denote all European slaves in some Muslim regions like Spain including those abducted from raids on Christian kingdoms of Spain. The Franks started buying slaves from the Slavs and Avar Khaganate while Muslims also came across slaves in the form of mercenaries serving the Byzantine Empire and settlers in addition to among the Khazars. Most Slavic slaves were imported to the Muslim world through the border between Christian and Islamic kingdoms where castration centres were also located instead of the direct route. From there they were sent into Islamic Spain and other Muslim-ruled regions especially North Africa. The saqaliba gained popularity in Umayyad Spain especially as warriors. After the collapse of the Umayyads, they also came to rule over many of the taifas. With the conversion of Eastern Europe, the trade declined and there isn't much textual information on saqaliba after 11th century.Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery saqaliba&f;=false The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery: A-K ; Vol. II, L-Z, by Junius P. Rodriguez Central Europe was the most favoured destination for importation of slaves alongside Central Asia and Bilad as-Sudan, though slaves from Northwestern Europe were also valued. This slave trade was controlled mostly by European slave traders. France and Venice were the routes used to send Slavic slaves to Muslim lands and Prague served as a major centre for castration of Slavic captives. The Emirate of Bari also served as an important port for this trade. Due to the Byzantine Empire and Venice blocking Arab merchants from European ports, they later started importing in slave from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. The Saqaliba were also imported as eunuchs and concubines to Muslim states. The slavery of eunuchs in the Muslim world however was expensive and they thus were given as gifts by rulers. The Saqaliba eunuchs were prominent at the court of Aghlabids and later Fatimids who imported them from Spain. The Fatimids also used other Saqaliba slaves for military purposes. =Crimean Khanate= In the time of the Crimean Khanate, Crimeans engaged in frequent raids into the Danubian principalities, Poland- Lithuania, and Muscovy. For each captive, the khan received a fixed share (savƒüa) of 10 percent or 20 percent. The campaigns by Crimean forces categorize into sefers, declared military operations led by the khans themselves, and √ßapuls, raids undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers. For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. Caffa was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets.Historical survey > Slave societies Crimean Tatar raiders enslaved between 1 and 2 million slaves from Russia and Poland-Lithuania over the period 1500‚Äì1700.Darjusz Ko≈Çodziejczyk, as reported by Caffa (city on Crimean peninsula) was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets. In 1769, a last major Tatar raid resulted in the capture of 20,000 Russian and Ruthenian slaves. =Barbary slave trade= The Barbary Coast The purchase of Christian captives by Catholic monks in the Barbary states. Slave markets flourished on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, in what is modern-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and western Libya, between the 15th and middle of the 18th century. These markets prospered while the states were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, though, in reality, they were mostly autonomous. The North African slave markets traded in European slaves which were acquired by Barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to Spain, Portugal, France, England, the Netherlands, and as far afield as the Turkish Abductions in Iceland. Men, women, and children were captured to such a devastating extent that vast numbers of sea coast towns were abandoned. 1815 illustration of a British Captain horrified by seeing Christians worked as slaves in Algiers. According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and Ottoman Empire between the 15th and 19th centuries.Davis, Robert. Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500-1800.\\"When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed\\", Research News, Ohio State University However, to extrapolate his numbers, Davis assumes the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates were constant for a 250-year period, stating: Davis' numbers have been challenged by other historians, such as David Earle, who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from west Africa. A second book by Davis, Holy War and Human Bondage: Tales of Christian-Muslim Slavery in the Early-Modern Mediterranean, widened its focus to related slavery.Robert Davis, Holy War and Human Bondage: Tales of Christian-Muslim Slavery in the Early-Modern Mediterranean, Praeger Series on the Early Modern World (2010). It is also worth noting that there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records. Middle East expert, John Wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation. Such observations, across the late 1500s and early 1600s observers, account for around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers. However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Spain and Italy. From bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the Barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as Baltimore, Ireland were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone had 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates.Rees Davies, \\"British Slaves on the Barbary Coast\\", BBC, 1 July 2003 While Barbary corsairs looted the cargo of ships they captured, their primary goal was to capture people for sale as slaves or for ransom. Those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive, but not obliged to work; the most famous of these was the author Miguel de Cervantes, who was held for almost five years. Others were sold into various types of servitude. Attractive women or boys could be used as sex slaves. Captives who converted to Islam were generally freed, since enslavement of Muslims was prohibited; but this meant that they could never return to their native countries.Diego de Haedo, Topograf√≠a e historia general de Argel, 3 vols., Madrid, 1927-29.Daniel Eisenberg, \\"¬øPor qu√© volvi√≥ Cervantes de Argel?\\", in Ingeniosa invenci√≥n: Essays on Golden Age Spanish Literature for Geoffrey L. Stagg in Honor of his Eighty-Fifth Birthday, Newark, Delaware, Juan de la Cuesta, 1999, , pp. 241-253, http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/por-qu-volvi-cervantes-de- argel-0/, retrieved 11/20/2014. Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail Ben Sharif controlled a fleet of corsairs based at Sal√©-le-Vieux and Sal√©-le-Neuf (now Rabat), which supplied him with Christian slaves and weapons through their raids in the Mediterranean and all the way to the Black Sea. Moulay Ismail was nicknamed the 'bloody king' by the Europeans due to his extreme cruelty and exaction of summary justice upon his Christian slaves. He is also known in his native country as the \\"Warrior King\\". 16th- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's additional slave import from the Black Sea may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700.The Cambridge World History of Slavery: Volume 3, AD 1420‚ÄìAD 1804 The markets declined after the loss of the Barbary Wars and ended in the 1830s, when the region was conquered by France. =Christian slavery in Muslim Spain= Abraham Duquesne delivering Christian captives in Algiers after the Bombardment of Algiers (1683). During the Al-Andalus (also known as Muslim Spain or Islamic Iberia), the Moors controlled much of the peninsula. They imported white Christian slaves from the 8th century until the Reconquista in the late 15th century. The slaves were exported from the Christian section of Spain, as well as Eastern Europe, sparking significant reaction from many in Christian Spain and many Christians still living in Muslim Spain. Soon after, Muslims were successful, taking 30,000 Christian captives from Spain. In the eighth century slavery lasted longer due to \\"frequent cross-border skirmishes, interspersed between periods of major campaigns\\". By the tenth century, in the eastern Mediterranean Byzantine, Christians were captured by Muslims. Many of the raids designed by Muslims were created for a fast capture of prisoners. Therefore, Muslims restricted the control in order to keep captives from fleeing. The Iberian peninsula served as a base for further exports of slaves into other Muslim regions in Northern Africa.Trade and traders in Muslim Spain, Fourth Series, Cambridge University Press, 1996. =Ottoman slave trade= Slavery was a legal and a significant part of the Ottoman Empire's economy and society.Supply of Slaves The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in Africa, Eastern Europe, and Circassia and Georgia in the Caucasus. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations.Spyropoulos Yannis, Slaves and freedmen in 17th- and early 18th-century Ottoman Crete, Turcica, 46, 2015, p. 181, 182. Enslavement of Europeans was banned in the early 19th century, while slaves from other groups were allowed.Ottomans against Italians and Portuguese about (white slavery). Even after several measures to ban slavery in the late 19th century, the practice continued largely unabated into the early 20th century. As late as 1908, female slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire. Sexual slavery was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution.Madeline C. Zilfi Women and slavery in the late Ottoman Empire Cambridge University Press, 2010 European slavery Relief from Smyrna (present-day Izmir, Turkey) depicting a Roman soldier leading captives in chains =Slavery in ancient Rome= The Slave Market, by Gustave Boulanger (1882) In the Roman Republic and later Roman Empire, slaves accounted for most of the means of industrial output in Roman commerce. Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, including Gaul, Hispania, North Africa, Syria, Germania, Britannia, the Balkans, and Greece. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital, where their number was largest, at its peak. Slaves numbering in the tens of thousands were condemned to work in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. Damnati in metallum (\\"those condemned to the mine\\") were convicts who lost their freedom as citizens (libertas), forfeited their property (bona) to the state, and became servi poenae, slaves as a legal penalty. Their status under the law was different from that of other slaves; they could not buy their freedom, be sold, or be set free. They were expected to live and die in the mines.Alfred Michael Hirt, Imperial Mines and Quarries in the Roman World: Organizational Aspects 27‚ÄìBC AD 235 (Oxford University Press, 2010), sect. 3.3. Imperial slaves and freedmen (the familia Caesaris) worked in mine administration and management.Hirt, Imperial Mines and Quarries, sect. 4.2.1. In the Late Republic, about half the gladiators who fought in Roman arenas were slaves, though the most skilled were often free volunteers.Alison Futrell, A Sourcebook on the Roman Games (Blackwell, 2006), p. 124. Successful gladiators were occasionally rewarded with freedom. However, gladiators being trained warriors and having access to weapons, were potentially the most dangerous slaves. At an earlier time, many gladiators had been soldiers taken captive in war. Spartacus, who led the great slave rebellion of 73-71 BCE, was a rebel gladiator. The slaves imported in Italy were native Europeans, and very few of them were from outside Europe. This has been confirmed by biochemical analysis of 166 skeletons from three imperial- era cemeteries in the vicinity of Rome (where the bulk of the slaves lived), which shows that only one individual came from outside of Europe (North Africa), and another two possibly did, but results are inconclusive. In the rest of the Italian peninsula, the fraction of non European slaves was much lower than that. =Slavery under Islamic rule= The \\"pen√ßik\\" or \\"pen√ß-yek\\" tax, meaning \\"one fifth\\", was a taxation based on a verse of the Quran; whereby one fifth of the spoils of war belonged to God, to Muhammad and his family, to orphans, to those in need and to travelers. This eventually included slaves and war captives were given to soldiers and officers to help motivate their participation in wars. Christians and Jews, known as People of the Book in Islam, were considered dhimmis in territories under Muslim rule, a status of second-class citizens that were afforded limited freedoms, legal protections, personal safety, and were allowed to \\"practice their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy\\". In order to keep these protections and rights, the protected people were required to pay the annual jizya and kharaj taxes as an acknowledgement of Muslim rule. According to Abu Yusuf, Failure to pay this tax should render the protected person's life and property void and subject the protected person to forced conversion, enslavement, imprisonment or death. If anyone had agreed to pay the jizya, leaving Muslim territory for enemy land was punishable by enslavement if captured.Humphrey Fisher (2001), Slavery in the History of Muslim Black Africa. NYU Press. p. 47. Failure to pay the yearly tax was commonly punished by house arrest and some legal authorities allowed enslavement of the protected people for non-payment of taxes.Mark R. Cohen (2005), Poverty and Charity in the Jewish Community of Medieval Egypt, Princeton University Press, , pp. 120‚Äì3; 130‚Äì8, Quotes: \\"Family members were held responsible for individual's poll tax (mahbus min al-jizya)\\"; \\"Imprisonment for failure to pay (poll tax) debt was very common\\"; \\"This imprisonment often meant house arrest... which was known as tarsim\\"I. P. Petrushevsky (1995), Islam in Iran, SUNY Press, , pp 155, Quote - \\"The law does not contemplate slavery for debt in the case of Muslims, but it allows the enslavement of Dhimmis for non-payment of jizya and kharaj.(...) \\" In South Asia, for example, seizure of protected families upon their failure to pay annual tax was one of the two significant sources of slaves sold in the slave markets of Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era.Scott C. Levi (2002), \\"Hindu Beyond Hindu Kush: Indians in the Central Asian Slave Trade.\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 12, Part 3 (November 2002): p. 282 The Devshirme was a blood tax largely imposed in the Balkans and Anatolia in which the Ottoman Empire sent military to collect Christian boys between the ages of 8 to 18 that were taken from their families and raised to serve the empire. The tax was imposed by Murad I in the mid 1300s and lasted until the reign of Ahmet III in the early 1700s. From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the dev≈üirme‚Äìjanissary system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non‚ÄìMuslim adolescent males.A. E. Vacalopoulos. The Greek Nation, 1453‚Äì1669, New Brunswick, New Jersey, Rutgers University Press, 1976, p. 41; Vasiliki Papoulia, The Impact of Devshirme on Greek Society, in War and Society in East Central Europe, Editor‚Äîin‚ÄîChief, Bela K. Kiraly, 1982, Vol. II, pp. 561‚Äî562. These boys would attain a great education and high social standing after their training and forced conversion to Islam. Basilike Papoulia wrote that \\"...the devsirme was the 'forcible removal', in the form of a tribute, of children of the Christian subjects from their ethnic, religious and cultural environment and their transportation into the Turkish- Islamic environment with the aim of employing them in the service of the Palace, the army, and the state, whereby they were on the one hand to serve the Sultan as slaves and freedmen and on the other to form the ruling class of the State.\\"Some Notes on the Devsirme, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol. 29, No. 1, 1966, V.L.Menage, (Cambridge University Press, 1966), 64. =Indentured servitude= In the modern era, many whites in Britain, Ireland and British North America were indentured servants, a form of slavery now banned by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but not all had the comfort of having the documentation of being indentured, and some indentured servants were treated just as badly as their African brethren. Sterling Professor of history at Yale University David Brion Davis wrote that:In the Image of God Religion, Moral Values, and Our Heritage of Slavery page 144 :From Barbados to Virginia, colonists long preferred English or Irish indentured servants as their main source of field labor; during most of the seventeenth century they showed few scruples about reducing their less fortunate countrymen to a status little different from chattel slaves - a degradation that was being carried out in a more extreme and far more extensive way with respect to the peasantry in contemporary Russia. The prevalence and suffering of white slaves, serfs and indentured servants in the early modern period suggests that there was nothing inevitable about limiting plantation slavery to people of African origin. Between 50 and 67 percent of white immigrants to the American colonies, from the 1630s and American Revolution, had traveled under indenture.Galenson 1984: 1 Many women brought to the colonies were poor, some were abandoned or young girls born out of wedlock, others prostitutes or criminals. One ship's captain reportedly described them as a \\"villainous and demoralized lot\\". Many were transported against their will and for profit to Virginia and Maryland. The French transported women from the Salp√™tri√®re prison for the homeless, insane and criminal to New Orleans. Women held at Salp√™tri√®re were bound in chains, flogged and lived in generally poor and unsanitary conditions. Female inmates, some of whom were sick with venereal disease, were forced to attend confessions three times each day where they would be whipped if their demeanor and behaviors were not acceptably penitent. In addition to Salp√™tri√®re, the French transported women from other almshouses and hospitals including Bic√™tre, H√¥pital g√©n√©ral de Paris and Piti√©. White slave traffic The International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic is a series of anti‚Äìhuman trafficking treaties, the first of which was first negotiated in Paris in 1904. It was one of the first multilateral treaties to address issues of slavery and human trafficking. The Slavery, Servitude, Forced Labour and Similar Institutions and Practices Convention of 1926 and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age of 1933 are similar documents. =White Slave Traffic Act of 1910= To battle sex trafficking in the United States, in 1910 the US Congress passed the White Slave Traffic Act (better known as the Mann Act), which made it a felony to transport women across state borders for the purpose of \\"prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\\" As more women were being trafficked from foreign countries, the US began passing immigration acts to curtail aliens from entering the country such as the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924. Following the banning of immigrants during the 1920s, human trafficking was not considered a major issue until the 1990s.Candidate, Jo Doezema Ph.D. \\"Loose women or lost women?

White slave crusades: race, gender, and anti-vice activism, 1887-1917. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2006. =Criminal Law Amendment (White Slave Traffic) Bill= An attempt was made to introduce a similar law into the UK between 1910 and 1913 as the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912. Arthur Lee would state in the House of Commons: \\"the United Kingdom, and particularly England, is increasingly becoming a clearing-house and depot and dispatch centre of the white slave traffic, and the headquarters of the foreign agents engaged in the most expensive and lucrative phase of the business.\\"Hansard CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT (WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC) BILL. HC Deb 10 June 1912 vol 39 cc571-627 South America was stated as the main destination for the trafficked girls. The Spectator commented that \\"the Bill has been blocked by a member [alluding to Frederick Booth ] or members who, for various reasons consider that it is not a measure which ought to be placed upon the statute book\\" as it would affect the liberty of the individual.

In this respect, the Supreme Court takes over the appellate functions formerly performed by the United Kingdom's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council before Fiji became a republic in 1987. The Constitution gave the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from all final judgements of the Court of Appeal.

This court has the power to review, vary, affirm, or discard decisions of the Court of Appeal, may order retrials, and may award costs to defendants and plaintiffs. Decisions of the Supreme Court are binding on all subordinate courts. At its own discretion, the Supreme Court may review any judgement or decision that it has previously rendered. Section 123 authorised the President of Fiji, on the advice of the Cabinet, to ask the Supreme Court to rule on actual or potential disagreements pertaining to the Constitution.

Dduallt is at a height of and a distance of just over from Porthmadog.  Station history  When steam traction was introduced on the railway in 1863, a slate water tank (which still exists) was established near Dduallt farm about below the present station and all up trains stopped for water. Regular use of this facility probably ceased about 1872 with the opening of Tan-y-Bwlch station (although up goods trains are said to have been required to stop at Dduallt for examination prior to passing through Moelwyn tunnel). There has never been road access to Dduallt station, which can only be reached by train or public footpaths. The quiet station at Dduallt was first mentioned as a passenger station in 1880. It was established as a signalling block post in 1884 on the closure of Tunnel South Signal Box. p187 It then declined steadily becoming an unstaffed halt in the 1930s (when it was landscaped by Clough Williams-Ellis who 40 years later advised on further landscaping) until final closure to passengers on 15 September 1939. Dduallt reopened to passenger trains on 6 April 1968, although passengers could not alight at the station for another few weeks because of continuing building work. The original slate water tank was recommissioned in May 1969 as an emergency supply and later a water supply was provided at the station, which was the upper terminus until 8 July 1977. The slate tablet dedicated to Colonel Campbell at Dduallt.  Facilities  The present buildings at Dduallt are a water supply tank (now out of use), a stone built shelter constructed by volunteers in 1998, and Rhoslyn cottage, which latterly was always privately owned until it was bought, derelict, by the Festiniog Railway Company in 2005. The land in the centre of Dduallt spiral is the knoll of a small hill and it is set out with an orientation table as a viewing point with extensive views over the upper vale of Ffestiniog. The knoll is a popular picnic spot in the summer. Dduallt station is operated as an unstaffed halt and trains only call on request. Passengers intending to travel are advised to check with the Ffestiniog Railway Company before embarking on their journey.  The Deviation  The old trackbed, now disused. Dduallt was the starting point for the Ffestiniog Railway Deviation, the diversionary route built between 1965 and 1978 to bypass the Ffestiniog Power Station pumped-storage hydroelectric power station, one of two pumped- storage schemes in Wales, and its lower reservoir (Llyn Ystradau). The Deviation (this is the conventional name for such railway works) was built mostly by volunteers and involved a long new tunnel constructed by three Cornish tin mining engineers (and some employees) between 1975 and 1977. At the southern end is the spectacular Dduallt spiral formation constructed with its bridge entirely by volunteers to gain an initial height rise of in order (after a further mile of the new railway and the new tunnel) to clear the flooded track bed north of the former tunnel. Parts of the trackless former route can be clearly seen below the new route, particularly just north of Dduallt. The old tunnel is plugged near its northern end, which is usually underwater. Some delicate engineering work was required where the new line passes over the power station pipelines. A pull and push service officially called The Shuttle and powered by diesel locomotive Moel Hebog with carriage 110 was operated from Dduallt to a temporary terminus at Gelliwiog, before the new Moelwyn Tunnel, from 26 May 1975, during two summers, to enable tourists to experience the excellent views from the Deviation route, in advance of the opening of the new Moelwyn Tunnel. For several years before this an earlier Shuttle had run between Tan-y-Bwlch and Dduallt in between the regular trains in the peak period. It was hauled by diesel locomotive Moelwyn with a short train of 4-wheeled coaches. Another temporary terminus known as \\"Llyn Ystradau\\" (now dismantled) existed alongside the reservoir during 1977, but passengers were not permitted to leave the station other than by train since it was on Central Electricity Generating Board land without public access.

The term is also applied to a modern sport created by re-enactors, and now played at a few United States institutions as a college club sport, based on what is known about the historical game. How the game was played The game was probably similar to early versions of the Irish sport of hurling, which also dates to antiquity. Today, no one knows exact rules of Knattleikr, but some information has survived from the Viking Age in Iceland (beginning around the 9th century). We know that players were divided into teams, each with a captain. The game demanded so much time that it was played from morning to night. It was a spectator game, with tournaments drawing huge crowds from all over Iceland. Game-play involved a hard ball was hit by a stick, although players could also use their hands. Body contact was allowed in the fight for the ball where the strongest had the best chance to win. Thus, intimidation was a vital ingredient; several wars of words have been recorded in the old sagas. There were penalties and a penalty box. It is conjectured by some that the playing field was lined, usually played on a flat ice‚Äêcovered surface, e.g. a frozen pond (though bumpy, land‚Äêbased ice, , is also mentioned). The Vikings may have used tar and sand under the soles of their boots for traction. Revival thumb Today, knattleikr is often re-enacted at medieval fairs and by Norse culture enthusiasts. It is also played on some college campuses. Brandeis University, Clark University, Providence College, and Yale University in particular are known for their teams. The first annual New England intercollegiate knattleikr competition (right) was played in April, 2007 at Clark University between Clark's team and Brandeis. The New England Viking reenactment group cautions that the game is dangerous and refers to the Icelandic Gr√°g√°s laws that a player may leave the game at any time. Historical references The most complete descriptions of the game are to be found in the following Icelandic sagas: *Grettis saga chapter 15 *G√≠sla saga chapters 15 and 18 *Egils saga chapter 40 *Eyrbyggja saga chapter 43 *V√°pnfir√∞inga saga chapter 4 See also *La Soule, played by the Norsemen of Normandy and Brittany. *Broomball, a modern Canadian version. *Harpastum a Roman ball game, a word probably derived from harpago, to snatch or take by violence. *Cuju, a Chinese ball game originally used to prepare soldiers for battle.

The Court of Appeal was a new institution established when the 1997 Constitution came into effect; the other two courts predated it. The Constitution authorizes the Court of Appeal \\"to hear and determine appeals\\" from all judgements of the High Court. From time to time, other powers may be assigned to this court by law. The Court of Appeal is chaired by the President of the Court of Appeal. The Chief Justice is not permitted to hold this position; the Court of Appeal is the only court from which the Chief Justice is constitutionally barred from membership. This is to give the Court of Appeal a measure of independence from the other courts. Also members of the Court of Appeal are the puisne judges, at least ten in number (who also sit on the High Court), and persons specifically appointed as Justice of Appeal. Section 129 of the Constitution declares that \\"A judge who has sat in a trial of a matter that is the subject of appeal to a higher court must not sit in the appeal.\\" As the membership of the High Court overlaps to a large extent with that of the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court, this clause is inserted to prevent a conflict of interest. These constitutional arrangements were temporarily upset by the Fiji coup of 2000. On the advice of then-Chief Justice Sir Timoci Tuivaga, the Interim Military Government of Commodore Frank Bainimarama promulgated three decrees suspending the Constitution and reforming the judiciary. The Supreme Court was abolished, and the Chief Justice was made President of the Appeal Court. Following a High Court order on 15 November 2000 to restore the Constitution, upheld by the Court of Appeal on 2 March 2001, the former judicial order was restored. Gordon Ward was appointed as the President of the Appeal Court, which position he held until 2007. In 2007, following the military coup of 5 December 2006, six Australian and New Zealand judges resigned from the court. They were replaced by two Malaysian judges, \\"with more appointments from Asia expected to follow soon\\". A Court of Appeals ruling in April 2009, which found that the 2006 coup had been illegal, triggered the 2009 Fijian constitutional crisis. Following the ruling by three Court of Appeals judges, all of whom were from Sydney, Australia, the President of Fiji suspended the country's constitution and removed all judges from office. Two of the three judges were on a plane bound for Australia at the time of the President's actions.The Age:A judge for four days as Fiji flails, Kate McClymont, The Age, April 11, 2009 A new panel of three judges was subsequently appointed.

The game is promoted as \\"stealth action inspired by genre-defined espionage classics\\" and gives players the ability to disguise themselves as any character in the game. The lack of advertising before release and realism in the game are commonly cited as reasons why this game was outshone by its competitors in the stealth genre and sold poorly. Plot The fictional Special Execution Agency (S.E.A.) sends three operatives from their Phantom Unit, Billy Bishop, Sheila Crawford and Nicklaus Nightwood; onto the roof of Castle Wolfgang in Austria. Eve, SEA's commanding officer, informs them that the terrorist group Enigma is inside the castle, and they must be stopped before they can utilize their bio-weapon \\"Lahder\\". The trio are successful in infiltrating the castle, but Nicklaus is captured in the process. The player infiltrates a chapel within the castle by posing as Enigma's second-in- command, Dietrich Troy. Inside, Bishop and Sheila are confronted by the real Dietrich, as well as Enigma's anonymous leader and a group of guards. Dietrich displays Nicklaus hung upon a crucifix, shooting and killing him as the leader leaves. A flashback commences once Nicklaus has died. The story proper begins two months prior to the game's opening. The player is heading a covert investigation into NanotechDyne Inc, a pharmaceutical company suspected of developing biochemical weapons. The SEA needs to access files on the computer of the new Research Director, Forrest Kaysen, who recently displaced Dr. Alice Coleman. The player must retrieve a password for the computer, also including a scan of Kaysen's retina to access the computer. The plan is a success, and the player is extracted and sent back in at midnight to access the computer. The player then secures the files, seeing the emblem of Enigma on the desktop. The player is teamed up with the other possible player character as well as Nicklaus and Phantom's team leader, Samuel Berkeley. Kaysen has been linked to the Metropolis' owner, Kelly Wong, and Phantom must observe a meeting between the doctor and the businesswoman. Sheila knocks Kaysen out, allowing Billy to pose as him and take his place at the meeting while Sheila eavesdrops. The player makes it to the demonstration without Nicklaus. Lahder turns out to be a small grenade-like sphere, emitting purple gas. Kaysen prepares to test the device on a monkey before an audience, mostly consisting of arms dealers and criminals. However, Wong nods to Troy, standing behind the scenes, and pushes Kaysen into isolation with Lahder and the monkey. Although Kaysen is killed, Nicklaus contacts the player stating that they've been discovered. The player attempts to escape, finding Wong surrounded by guards. The player disarms Wong and neutralizes her men, holding her at gunpoint. Troy appears, holding the player at gunpoint as well, and shoots Wong. Disguising themselves as Troy to enter the plant, the player destroys the payload and sets out to escape before US forces bomb the facility. The player then finds a wounded Nicklaus locked in a storage crate. He tells the player that Dr. Coleman is in the holding cells, and the player goes to rescue her. After a gunfight, Coleman is captured by General Douglas Lysander. The player chases and then battles Lysander before Nicklaus fatally shoots him, allowing them to secure Coleman and escape. Enigma announces their ultimatum, demanding the US \\"confess its sins\\" and resign from the UN Security Council. Bishop, Sheila and Samuel are then sent to the Rodt Rose Railway Station in Austria to resolve a hostage situation caused by Enigma. Samuel is wounded in combat, and sends the player to free the hostages. The hostage situation turns out to be staged, and the player is ambushed after Troy suggests that there is a traitor in Phantom. Troy elaborates on Enigma's plans, saying that they intend to trigger a third World War. Troy escapes, and Samuel reveals that Enigma's leader is actually a former Phantom leader named Dimitri Vedernikov, aka Scarface, and that Vedernikov was once Samuel's partner, and is Billy's father. Bishop and Sheila decide to sacrifice Samuel, sending him toward a bridge rigged with explosives and ending his life. The player then returns to Nicklaus's death in the chapel. The player wounds Troy in battle, before special forces arrive and fatally shoot him. The player continues forward to confront Scarface, who is preparing to fly the Metropolis filled with Lahder. over the US. Before the battle, Sheila is revealed to be one of the Gospel Children known as AG7753, before Scarface gave her a name. Scarface battles the player and reveals his cyborg body, but is defeated, and uses a vaccine called Jacob created by Coleman to destroy the virus, leaving Scarface to die in the explosion. Following Metropolis' destruction, Eve later manages to get into contact after someone jammed the transmission. Nicklaus is actually alive, and the body recovered from the chapel is Phantom's tech officer, Michael Kwan. Bishop and Sheila track Nicklaus to an Airbase, where he intends to flee, now revealed as double agent for both Phantom and Enigma. During the confrontation, Nicklaus reveals himself to be Dietrich Troy (The one that was killed in the chapel by the Special Forces was a decoy). Nicklaus explains that he was against both Enigma and Phantom, acting for his own motives of revenge against Scarface and Billy, of whom he is the half-brother. Nicklaus had been seeking revenge on Scarface for killing his mother, and Billy out of jealousy that \\"While [Nicklaus] froze in a Siberian orphanage, [Billy] grew up with a mother who loved [him]\\". Nicklaus uses a flash grenade to escape, prompting Bishop and Sheila to chase him as he boards a plane and starts down the runway. The player shoots a hole in the gas tank, and uses a flare to ignite it as Nicklaus takes off. The flare burns along the gas trail, reaching the plane and destroying it, killing Nicklaus as well. The game ends with Billy wondering who \\"the battle was really against\\". Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. It was inspired from other games of the genre, most notably Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and WinBack.

Consolidated was active from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Live performances Consolidated were notable for including in each of their live performances a period of time in which microphones were passed among audience members, who could then discuss, rebut, argue or elaborate upon the topics of Consolidated's songs. Consolidated devised these interactions as a way to subvert the typically passive experience of watching a band perform, empowering the audience members to respond and articulate their own opinions on issues addressed in the song lyrics or even the nature of the performance itself. Consolidated recorded many of these interactions and sampled excerpts of them to be included on their albums. In some cases, these samples were arranged and featured as short interludes between songs, while in other cases they were worked into the sonic collages of the songs themselves (e.g., \\"Crusading Rap Guys\\" on the 1991 LP Friendly Fa$cism.) Consolidated's live performances featured video montages that were either projected onto large screens, or featured on multiple television sets positioned along the perimeter of the stage. The video footage included their promotional music video clips for their singles, as well as video art composed of found footage which corresponded to the lyrical topics of specific songs (e.g., myths of male sexuality, sexist depictions of women in mass media, and the inhumane treatment of animals in laboratories and slaughterhouses). Local, regional and national activist groups were invited by Consolidated to set up tables and information kiosks at their shows while they were on tour.

The current members are Del Alien, Max Rael and Jamu. Their name comes from the title of one of their earliest songs, written about the Dunblane massacre. Primarily a studio project, History of Guns played live sporadically throughout their career including the Whitby Gothic Weekend and both Futurepunk23 and Back To The Futurepunk. History Of Guns Lineoutrecords.com In 2007, their song Your Obedient Servants came in at no.19 in journalist Mick Mercer's list of Top 30 Goth Singles Of All Time. In April 2008, Line Out Records sponsored the Whitby Gothic Weekend bi-annual football tournament so teams were competing for, 'The History of Guns - Acedia Challenge Cup'.Whitby Gazette Their third album ACEDIA was released on 7 July 2008 on Line Out Records and was awarded 9/10 by Rock Sound on 3 July 2008. A reaction against the relentless miserablism of Acedia, History Of Guns followed it up with The Spice Girls EP in April 2009. A light-hearted, three- song investigation into The Spice Girls, including the track \\"Slice Up Your Wife\\". Their latest release was Whatever You Do, Don't Turn Up At Twelve, released on Zero State Media / Line Out Records on 21 October 2011. In August 2015 they were featured in the Beautiful Noise exhibition at Hertford Museum of notable bands from the area.  History  =Phase One: Beginning (1996-1999)= History of Guns was formed in February 1996 as 'Pre-Hate Machine' by Stagger Lee with Max Rael and Del Alien. Del Alien renamed the band 'History Of Guns' after a song he had written about the Dunblane Massacre in mid 1996. Their first demo Reformation Day was recorded in a day at Discipline Studios in Tottenham in July 1996. In September 1996 Gary 'The Reverend' Hughes joined the band as a regular part-time collaborator. The band signed up with Top Knotch Management in 1997 and recorded a second demo Sold On Secrets in Chelmsford. In 1999, the band acquired a PC, and began recording with Cubase. The first track recorded in this fashion was \\"Random Death Bag\\" which appeared on the third instalment of the No Holy Additive compilation CD from Godreah Zine, followed by the Little Miss Suicide EP which was released on the newly formed Liquid Len record label, and an unreleased demo album called 'Enough Is Too Much LP'. Stagger Lee quit the band with the release of their first CD, Little Miss Suicide EP in 1999. =Phase Two: Liquid Len Records (2001 - 2006)= In 2001, Godreah zine contacted the band with a request for them to appear on the fourth and final instalment of the No Holy Additive compilation CD. Del Alien and Max Rael recorded their first new material for two years, namely, Reconstructing Terror, Fact and Disconnect, they also completed two unfinished tracks left over from Enough Is Too Much sessions namely, 57 Days and Burn, which eventually got released as the Disconnect EP by the Liquid Len record label in 2002. Kevin Gerrish joined the band briefly in 2002 during the writing and recording of The Mirror Pond LP. Weeks before its release History of Guns issued a press released saying that they'd been \\"consumed by business rhetoric\\" and were thus \\"downsizing the album into an EP\\". Although many of the remaining tracks remain unreleased, the track 'Psycho' was included as a bonus track on the second edition of the CD, and 'Sunday Lunchtime (A Family Portrait)' and 'Soaked' were included on the 2007 release 'Issue Six:Archive One - Make It Look Like An Accident'. History of Guns released their debut album Flashes Of Light LP in 2004. A dense slab of atmospheric dark electronica devoid of any guitars, noted for its unusual structure of having two long opening songs, four short middle songs, then two long closing songs. Recruiting a live band in 2004 History of Guns performed gigs around the south east of England as an edgy punk band, not performing any of the songs from their debut album. The last date was filmed and released on DVD as \\"Twenty Seven Paces\\". Their second album APOPHENIA was released in November 2005. It was named after the medical condition of seeing patterns in seemingly random data, Apophenia. This time the album was structured in two distinct halves, and every track on the album written and performed in a different genre. Responding to an interview with Dark Futures zine in which History of Guns said they worked very quickly, to which the interviewer replied \\"how did it take two years to make your new album then?\\" History of Guns announced a series of free limited edition bi-monthly CDs, starting with the March 2006 release UDDERS available via their website. In April 2006, they played their debut at the Whitby Gothic Weekend. In November 2006, the band announced that they had signed to Line Out Records and would no longer be able to keep to their schedule of releasing a new EP every other month whilst they wrote and recorded their third album to be titled ACEDIA. =Phase Three: Line Out Records (2007 - present) = History of Guns' third album ACEDIA was released on 7 July 2008 on Line Out Records. The album title came from the lyrics to Of Walking Abortion by Manic Street Preachers from their The Holy Bible album The inside sleeve artwork features a copy of No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai. Downwithfreedom.com provided an animated music video for the track 'Exhaust Fumes' which appeared on YouTube in October 2008. In July 2009, History Of Guns released a three track EP focussing on The Spice Girls, featuring Slice Up Your Wife which incorporated elements of the original Spice Girls song Spice Up Your Life described by The Dreaded Press as \\"a sub-three-minute slice of staggering satire and vengeful rage\\" On 21 October that year, the band released their fourth album, Whatever You Do, Don't Turn Up At Twelve.

Magriel became New York State Junior Chess Champion (January 1967) at the age of 20, while a student at New York University. Backgammon Known as X-22 on the backgammon circuit, Magriel arguably won more major backgammon tournaments than any other player in the world. He was widely considered the world's premier backgammon teacher, an original and clear-thinking theorist and one of its best players. The sobriquet X-22 originates from Magriel's simulation of a real backgammon tournament (compare simultaneous exhibition in chess) with 64 boards, designated X-1 through x-64, in which the player designated \\"X-22\\" has eventually won. Magriel first came to prominence on the backgammon circuit when he won the World Backgammon Championship in 1978. From 1977 to 1980, he wrote weekly backgammon columns for The New York Times. Paul and Ren√©e Magriel (his first wife, later Roberts) wrote two books, Backgammon,Backgammon. 1976 edition: Chicago: Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Company. . Backgammon. 2004 edition by Paul David Magriel Jr. and Ren√©e Magriel Roberts. Harwich Port: Clock & Rose Press. , . widely considered to be the bible of the game, and an abridgement for beginning players, An Introduction to Backgammon: A Step-by-Step Guide.An Introduction to Backgammon: A Step-by-Step Guide. An abridged version of the 1976 edition of Backgammon. Chicago: Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Company, Inc. 1978. . Magriel was featured in the commentary in the televised backgammon series, High Stakes Backgammon, produced from the 2005 World Backgammon Championships held in Monte Carlo. It was the pilot series that led to the World Series of Backgammon and showcased Magriel's oratory skills. Poker Magriel had several notable finishes in poker tournaments from the mid-1990s in Europe, playing in London, Paris and Vienna in Omaha, hold'em and seven-card stud events. He won the ‚Ç¨2,000 no limit hold'em event at the Aviation Club de France in September 2002, defeating a field including Pascal \\"Triple P\\" Perrault, Patrick Bruel and Simon \\"Aces\\" Trumper on the way to the ‚Ç¨48,600 first prize. In March 2003, he made his first World Poker Tour (WPT) final table, finishing 4th in the $5,000 no limit hold'em World Poker Challenge event in Reno. Magriel finished in the money eight times at the World Series of Poker (WSOP), which includes one cash in the Main Event in 2010, he has also made the final table on the Professional Poker Tour and Ultimate Poker Challenge. Magriel created the \\"M Principle\\" (better known since as the M-ratio) - a theory elaborated on at great length in the book Harrington on Hold'em Volume II by former WSOP Champion \\"Action\\" Dan Harrington and Bill Robertie. The theory explains at which stages of tournaments expected value exists to make moves on other players, depending on the ratio between chip stack sizes and antes. While playing poker, Magriel often shouted \\"Quack quack!\\" while making a bet, usually to declare a bet which had a numerical value beginning in 22 (e.g.: 2200, 22000.) This is a reference to his nickname, X-22, since a pair of 2's are known in backgammon as \\"double ducks\\" and poker as ducks. As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $490,000. Family and miscellaneous Magriel was the son of Paul David Magriel, Sr. (1906‚Äì1990), an art collector and author, and Christine Fairchild Magriel, an architect. His younger half-brother is the sarangi player and teacher Nicolas Magriel.

The company is funded by grant-in-aid from the Latvian government (around 60%), with the remainder coming from television commercials. Although moving LTV to licence fee funding has long been debated, this has been consistently opposed by the government. Many media analysts believe that the real reason for this is that the government is reluctant to lose the control of LTV that state-funding gives it. LTV is a member of the European Broadcasting Union, having joined on 1 January 1993. From the restoration of independence in 1991 to 31 December 1992, it was a member of the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT). LTV hosted the annual Eurovision Song Contest in 2003, as well as the IIHF Men's Ice Hockey Championships in 2006 and the inaugural Eurovision Choir of the Year competition in 2017. History = 1954 to 1993 = First test broadcasting started on 6 November 1954 from Soviet-occupied Riga in black-and-white and it was seen by only 20 television owners. It is the first and oldest national television station in the Baltic countries. Regular broadcasting started on 20 November 1954. At the start, LTV didn't have rights to create their own programming. In 1955 Riga's Television studio was created and since then programming was created by the studio. On 19 March 1958, the first evening news show went on the air. In 1963, it was renamed to PanorƒÅma, as it is known to this day. A second TV channel was launched in 1961 and both channels converted to S√âCAM color in 1974. In 1986, both the Riga TV Tower and the LTV television headquarters were officially completed. = 1993 onwards = Latvian Television building on the island of Zaƒ∑usala On 1 January 1993, Latvian Television and Radio Latvia became members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). On 2 February 1998, LTV along with LNT, Channel 31 (now TV3) and TV Riga (later TV5) converted to PAL color. In 2008, LTV started broadcasting in digital terrestrial TV standard in MPEG2 format, changing to MPEG4 format on 1 August 2009 as the telecommunications company Lattelecom has been chosen to be the official integrator of digital terrestrial TV in Latvia. Analogue distribution of LTV7 finished on 1 March 2010. LTV completely finished broadcasting LTV1 in analogue format on 1 July 2010. Both LTV channels are also available on the Sirius satellite's Nordic beam as part of the Viasat package. LTV changed its aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 in 2003.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctw_jFyYrnk LTV1 maina attƒìla malu attiecƒ´bu uz 16:9. ltvpanorama on YouTube. A full switch to HDTV broadcasts, currently planned for 2021 or 2022, has not so far been implemented due to financial constraints, although selected programming such as live broadcast of a staging of The Nutcracker by the Latvian National Opera on LTV1 in 2012 and the matches of the IIHF World Championships on LTV7 since 2018, has been shown in HD. = Public Broadcasting of Latvia (since 2013) = Since 2013 LTV has come under the umbrella of Public Broadcasting of Latvia along with Radio Latvia, as part of the unification process of both public broadcasters. LTV and Radio Latvia now share one news portal, LSM.lv, and an online streaming service (REplay.lv), with content from both broadcasters. In 2017 LTV launched the online channel Visiem LTV (also styled VISIEMLTV.LV) for foreign viewers, mostly targeted for the Latvian diaspora. The programming is a mix of LTV1 and LTV7 broadcasts that are not restricted by copyright laws and are available globally.

Further information on the dance routines may be obtained, where available, by clicking on the film links. While Fred Astaire remains the most prolific and influential dancer in cinema history, his corpus is also valued for its inventiveness, virtuosity and precision of execution, indeed a hallmark of Astaire was his determination never to repeat himself. Roberta (1935) was the last film where the taps were all recorded live, after this virtually all of Fred Astaire's taps were re-recorded by him in post production, and while this was common practice in Hollywood musicals of the time - for example Ginger Rogers' taps on the Astaire-Rogers pictures were post-recorded by Astaire's collaborator Hermes Pan - it was unusual for a major star to undertake such a tedious and time-consuming task. It was the act of a perfectionist who was by no means a workaholic - between films he would seldom dance, devoting himself instead to his family and favorite pastimes of horseracing and golf. The controversy over the use of film clips of Astaire's dances Clips showing Astaire's filmed dances are rarely shown in public today, although they have featured in films such as The Green Mile and, more controversially, in 1997 Dirt Devil commercials. Astaire always retained the sole rights to his dances and after his death, these rights - which are essentially rights of publicity - passed to his widow Robyn Smith Astaire - who charges a fee schedule for the airing of these clips that some program producers consider uneconomic. Mrs. Astaire has contended that the license fees are moderate and are used to help fund litigation to defend against copyright infringement of her late husband's estate. In recent years, following the issuance of most of Astaire's films on DVD and the advent of sites such as YouTube which feature many of his most famous dance clips, the public is becoming increasingly exposed to his work. Solo dances The solo dances are classified according to genre. An asterisk (*) after the entry indicates the backing presence of chorus dancers for at least part of the routine. A (w/ song) after the entry indicates that Astaire sings the song as an introduction or accompaniment to the dance. For the purposes of this classification a tap solo is defined as a routine where a substantial part of the routine is taken up with tap steps. =Tap solos without props= * \\"Music Makes Me\\" from Flying Down to Rio (1933). * \\"Don't Let It Bother You\\" from The Gay Divorcee (1934). * \\"It's Just Like Looking For A Needle In A Haystack\\" from The Gay Divorcee.

(w/ song) Partnered dances Dance routines are grouped by dance partner who, in turn, are listed alphabetically. Astaire also created dances where he danced with two or three partners (or a sequence of partners) and these are grouped separately and listed chronologically. For many years, Fred Astaire was plagued by interviewers who wished to know who his favorite dance partner was. Ever the gentleman, Astaire would often cheekily reply with \\"Bing Crosby\\". The closest he may have come to identifying a possible favorite was in Interview magazine in June 1973 where he said: \\"Barrie Chase is the best partner - she's the latest partner that I've had, and believe me, that girl has got it - that girl can dance.\\" =Duets (primarily with one dance partner)= * Jack Buchanan in \\"I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan\\" from The Band Wagon (1953). * Lucille Bremer in ** \\"This Heart of Mine\\" and \\"Limehouse Blues\\" from Ziegfeld Follies (1944,1946). ** \\"Dream Ballet\\" and \\"Coffee Time\\" from Yolanda and the Thief (1945). * Leslie Caron in \\"Daydream Sequence (3rd section)\\", \\"The Sluefoot\\" and \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" from Daddy Long Legs (1955). * Cyd Charisse in ** \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" and \\"Girl Hunt Ballet\\" from The Band Wagon (1953). ** \\"It's A Chemical Reaction That's All\\"/\\"All of You\\" and \\"Fated To Be Mated\\" from Silk Stockings (1957). * Barrie Chase in ** \\"Change Partners\\" and \\"St. James Infirmary\\" from An Evening with Fred Astaire (1958). ** \\"That Face\\", \\"My Baby\\"/\\"Word Jazz\\" and \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" from Another Evening with Fred Astaire (1959). ** \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\", \\"The Blues\\" and \\"Anitra's Shuffle\\" from Astaire Time (1960). ** \\"The Shake\\" from Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, Episode 30: Think Pretty, (1964). ** \\"Re- animated mannequin dance\\" from The Hollywood Palace, Episode 74, (1966). ** \\"See-See Rider\\" and \\"Boom-Boom\\" from The Hollywood Palace, Episode 88, (1966). ** \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\", \\"The Look of Love\\", \\"Limehouse Blues\\", and \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\" from The Fred Astaire Show (1968). * Petula Clark in \\"Look to the Rainbow\\" from Finian's Rainbow (1968). * Joan Crawford in \\"Heigh Ho The Gang's All Here\\"/\\"Let's Go Bavarian\\" from Dancing Lady (1933). * Bing Crosby in ** \\"I'll Capture Your Heart\\" from Holiday Inn (1942). ** \\"A Couple Of Song And Dance Men\\" from Blue Skies (1946). * Virginia Dale in \\"You're Easy To Dance With\\" from Holiday Inn (1942). * LeRoy Daniels in \\"A Shine On My Shoes\\" from The Band Wagon (1953). * Joan Fontaine in \\"Things Are Looking Up\\" from A Damsel in Distress (1937).

Choreographic collaborators Although Astaire was the primary choreographer of all his dance routines, he welcomed the input of collaborators. This is particularly true in the case of his principal collaborator, Hermes Pan, where the seamless nature of the collaboration has been described by Astaire's rehearsal pianist Hal Borne, the only independent witness present throughout the entire process of dance creation of the Astaire-Rogers films: \\"It was hard to figure who contributed what to the choreography\\". Borne also describes the working atmosphere of such collaborations: \\"It was always pleasant. Never a hint of unpleasantness.\\" Given the consistency of Astaire's dance style in subsequent films made with or without the assistance of Pan, and the fact that he choreographed all the routines during his Broadway career with his sister Adele, dance historian John Mueller is of the opinion that Astaire acted as lead choreographer in his solos and partnered dances throughout his career. Later in his career he became a little more amenable to accepting the direction of his collaborators, however this was almost always confined to the area of extended fantasy sequences, or \\"dream ballets\\". Occasionally Astaire took joint screen credit for choreography or \\"dance direction\\" as it was known in the 1930s and 1940s but, as was the custom in musical films of the period, he generally left the screen credit to his collaborator. This can lead to the completely misleading impression that Astaire merely performed the choreography of others. Later in life he admitted: \\"I had to do most of it myself.\\" * Robert Alton in You'll Never Get Rich (1941), Ziegfeld Follies (1944/1946), Easter Parade (1948), The Barkleys of Broadway (1949), and The Belle of New York (1952). * Nick Castle in Royal Wedding (1951). * Bobby Connolly in Broadway Melody of 1940 (1940). * Danny Dare in Holiday Inn (1942). * Dave Gould in Flying Down to Rio (1933) and The Gay Divorcee (1934). * Michael Kidd in The Band Wagon (1953). * Sammy Lee in Dancing Lady (1933). * Eugene Loring in Ziegfeld Follies (1944/1946), Yolanda and the Thief (1945), Funny Face (1957) and the numbers not involving Astaire in Silk Stockings (1957).

Biography Paragon was founded by guitarist Martin Christian (who in many of the band's album booklets is written as Martin W√∂bcke when it comes to songwriting-credits). After releasing some demo tapes and a mini-CD, they were able to release an album in 1994, the debut World of Sin. Shortly after this, their record company Blue Merle went bankrupt, and Martin decided to put the band on hiatus. About two years later, Martin found four new members (Andreas, Jan, Markus, & Claudius) and recorded the album The Final Command. In 1999, Chalice of Steel was released. In 2001, Paragon released Steelbound, engineered and produced by Piet Sielck of Iron Savior. Piet has worked with the band on every album since then. After the recording of Forgotten Prophecies in early 2007, the band's longtime bass player Jan B√ºnning quit the band because of \\"musical differences.\\" Shortly after the band had found a replacement in Dirk Seifert. In late 2007 the band changed labels to Massacre Records and released Screenslaves in 2008. In the mid to ending months of 2009, Paragon took a break. During this time they lost two members.

Purchased for the nation from the Rothschild family, it was opened to the public by Neville Chamberlain, then Minister of Health, on 21 May 1926. The park is currently jointly managed by Hounslow and Ealing borough councils.New approach for Gunnersbury Park , Hounslow London Borough Council, UK. Retrieved on 2 February 2008. A major restoration project funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund was completed in 2018. The park and garden is Grade II listed. History =Origins= The original Gunnersbury House around 1750. The name Gunnersbury derives from Gunylda, the niece of King Canute who lived there until her banishment from England in 1044. The manor, owned by the Bishop of London, was occupied by the Frowyk family in the 15th century; Sir Thomas Frowyk, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was born there in 1460.E. Foss, 'Frowyk, Thomas', in The Judges of England: With Sketches of their Lives, 9 vols (Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans and Roberts, London 1848-1864), V (1857), pp. 51-53. =Early modern era= In the mid-17th century, Gunnersbury was acquired by Sir John Maynard, a lawyer and politician during the time of Cromwell.John Maynard in Dictionary of National Biography. It was he who in around 1663 built Gunnersbury House, a Palladian mansion modelled on the Villa Badoer, and designed by John Webb, the pupil and son-in-law of Inigo Jones. A map of Ealing dated 1777, shows the house in the north-east corner of the park, facing a horseshoe-shaped lake.Nichol‚Äôs Ealing parish map 1777 The house was bought in 1739 from Maynard's great grandson John Hobart, 1st Earl of Buckinghamshire by wealthy merchant and MP Henry Furnese, after whose death in 1756 it was sold to Princess Amelia, the daughter of George II. Daniel Defoe visited Gunnersbury in 1742. He wrote: \\"...(The Mansion) stands on an eminence, the ground falling gradually from it to the Brentford Road; from the Portico‚Ä¶you have an exceeding fine prospect of the County of Surrey, the river Thames‚Ä¶and a good prospect of London in clear weather‚Ä¶\\" =Princess Amelia= Princess Amelia landscaped the Park In 1760, the house and estate were purchased for Princess Amelia, favourite daughter of George II. Plans for her to marry Prince Frederick of Prussia (who later became Frederick the Great of Prussia) had come to nothing, and when her father died, Amelia had lost her apartments at St James's Palace. She took a house in Hanover Square and used Gunnersbury House and estate as a country summer retreat. Amelia ‚Äì George III‚Äôs aunt, \\"that odd and hearty lady\\" ‚Äì made Gunnersbury famous with her parties and political intrigues. The previous owner, Henry Furnese, had the grounds landscaped by William Kent in the 18th-century landscape style. Princess Amelia continued this, building a bathhouse in the grounds. =19th Century= After Amelia died in 1786, the estate had a number of owners. In 1788 it was acquired by Colonel Ironside, who sold it again in 1792 to a Walter Stirling. John Morley decided in 1801 to pull down the mansion and sell the land off piecemeal in 13 lots (the old house occupying Lot 2). The lots were eventually acquired by only two people, Alexander Copland (10 lots in 1802 and a further 2 in 1806), and Stephen Cosser (Lot 1 in 1802, sold to Major Alexander Morrison in 1807). Two separate estates were then established, each with its own new house. Copland, who bought 76 acres/30 hectares (most of the original grounds), was a builder and business partner of Henry Holland, and built the \\"Large Mansion\\" which was known, with its grounds, as \\"Gunnersbury Park\\". The \\"Small Mansion\\" was built virtually alongside in around 1806‚Äì1809, the builders evidently recognising the suitability of the position ‚Äì an elevated terrace overlooking the horseshoe-lake near where the original mansion had stood. The small mansion and grounds were known as \\"Gunnersbury House\\". =Rothschilds= In 1835, the merchant and financier Nathan Mayer Rothschild purchased the Large Mansion and park shortly before he died. The Small Mansion and its grounds were acquired in 1889 by the Rothschilds from the Thomas Farmer family (who had owned it since 1828), finally reuniting the original estate. The Rothschilds extended Gunnersbury further, acquiring most of the Old Brentford Common Field to the west, as well as land to the north. An old clay-pit in the south-west, \\"Cole‚Äôs Hole\\" was landscaped to become the Potomac lake, and the tile-kiln beside it modified to become a boat-house disguised as a gothic folly. An Orangery was built in 1836 to a design by Sydney Smirke. =20th century= In 1925, following the death of Nathan's grandson Leopold de Rothschild, Leopold's wife, Maria, and son Lionel, sold the 200 acre/80 hectare Gunnersbury estate, which was entirely contained within the Brentford Urban District, to the adjacent Ealing Borough Council and Acton Borough Council for ¬£130,000. The land lay entirely outside their boundaries and the purchase was driven by snobbery. The \\"Queen of the Suburbs\\" did not want Brentford's municipal housing on its doorstep and the Mayor of Acton concurred, persuading her Borough Council to make it a joint purchase. Following the First World War, there was a demand for house-building land. In addition the construction of the Great West Road, immediately south of the estate, was attracting modern industries along its \\"Golden Mile\\". Lionel Nathan de Rothschild had purchased an estate at Exbury, Hampshire in 1919 and was investing in a fine woodland garden there, so selling off the Gunnersbury estate presented an attractive opportunity. Disgruntled Ealing ratepayers wrote to the papers complaining about the burden on their rate bills. The adjacent Brentford and Chiswick Borough Council commented that since Ealing already had The Common and several other parks, not to mention Kew Gardens close by, another park would be unnecessary. They insisted that the greater part of the land should be used for housing, and opposed the loan of the purchase money to Ealing and Acton from the Ministry of Health. However, \\"civic pride and snobbery prevailed\\", and the Rothschilds sold Gunnersbury on condition that it was only to be used for leisure and recreation ‚Äî although of the 200 acres/80 hectares, 13 acres were allowed to be used for building houses along the Popes Lane and Lionel Road boundaries of the estate to raise funds to pay off the loan. When he opened the park on 21 March 1926, Neville Chamberlain \\"...rejoiced that the people had come into the possession of so magnificent and historical park...\\" He bemoaned the failure of earlier generations to recognise the need for open spaces in the towns and cities, when outdoor recreation was the privilege of the few. The large mansion was converted into an exhibition space for local history and archaeology, costume and fine art as the Gunnersbury Park Museum in 1929. An adjoining area of Rothschild land just outside the Gunnersbury estate became the Gunnersbury Cemetery the same year. The park passed to the London Borough of Hounslow in 1965 and the Gunnersbury Park Joint Committee with Ealing was set up in 1967. =21st century= The Long Gallery after restoration A ¬£50 million-pound, four year restoration was completed in June 2018 with the reopening of the large mansion. The restoration was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Ealing Council and Hounslow Council and English Heritage. An outdoor sporting facility is due open to the public in 2020. In popular culture Gunnersbury Park Museum The large mansion is quite recognisable as the venue for the Police Exhibition in the climax of the Ealing Studios Comedy The Lavender Hill Mob filmed in 1951. In 1991 the London-based indie band The Hit Parade released their single 'In Gunnersbury Park'; the song describes the failing relationship between songwriter J.Henry and his girlfriend who lived a short distance from the Park in Bollo Lane. In 2020, Gunnersbury Park and its museum served as the location of the music video of Liam Gallagher's single \\"Once\\".

According to the now-abrogated Chapter 9 of the Fijian 1997 Constitution, there must be a minimum of ten puisne judges, who are appointed by the President on the nomination of the Judicial Service Commission, who must first consult the appropriate Cabinet Minister and the committee of the House of Representatives responsible for the administration of justice. A puisne judge must be a qualified barrister or solicitor with a minimum of seven years' experience in Fiji or another country prescribed by law, or one who holds or has held a high judicial position in Fiji or another country prescribed by Parliament. The judiciary is the only branch of government from which non-citizens are not excluded. This is in recognition that as a developing country, the government may deem it in the national interest to look abroad for judges with expertise in various aspects of the law. Accordingly, judges from the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, among other countries, have sometimes served on Fiji's courts. Puisne judges are appointed for terms between four and seven years, and are required to retire on the expiry of their term or at the age of 65, whichever event occurs sooner. The retirement age for puisne judges, unlike that of other judges, may not be waived. They are eligible, however, for subsequent appointment to other judicial positions, such as Justice of Appeal (including President of the Court of Appeal), Supreme Court justice, or Chief Justice. In addition, compulsory retirement at age 65 does not disqualify such a person from acting as a puisne judge on a temporary basis. Judges who are past retirement age may therefore be called out of retirement, from time to time, to temporarily fill vacancies or to act in the place of a judge who is absent or otherwise unable to perform his or her duties.

Members of the gang stole wallets, burglarized stores, and engaged in other hustles. The 107th Street gang operated under the protection of Bronx-East Harlem family boss Gaetano \\"Tom\\" Reina. By the age of eighteen, Lucchese had started a window washing company in East Harlem; anyone refusing to buy window washing would have their windows broken. In 1920, Lucchese was arrested in Riverhead, Long Island, on auto theft charges. During his booking, a police officer compared Lucchese's deformed hand with that of Mordecai \\"Three Finger\\" Brown, a popular Major League Baseball pitcher.Ragano, Raab (1994) pg. 219 The officer nicknamed Lucchese \\"Three Finger Brown\\", an alias that Lucchese always disliked. In January 1921, Lucchese was convictedUnited States of America v.

Lucchese served thirteen months at Sing Sing Correctional Facility before he was paroled. It would be Lucchese's only conviction. Lucchese was released from prison in 1923, three years into prohibition. His old friends Charlie Luciano, Frank Costello, and Meyer Lansky had become partners with Jewish gangster Arnold \\"the Brain\\" Rothstein selling bootleg alcohol. During the 1920s, Lucchese became a strong ally of Luciano's and became a top member of Gaetano Reina's crime family. In August 1927, Lucchese was arrested under the alias of \\"Thomas Arra\\" and charged with receiving stolen goods. On July 18, 1928, Lucchese was arrested along with his brother-in-law, Joseph Rosato, for the murder of Louis Cerasulo; the charges were later dropped. Castellammarese War In early 1931, the Castellammarese War broke out between Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer the death of his boss, Masseria, in return for receiving Masseria's rackets and becoming Maranzano's second-in- command. On April 15, 1931, Luciano had lured Masseria to a meeting where he was murdered at a restaurant called Nuova Villa Tammaro on Coney Island.Raab, Selwyn. Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires. New York: St. Martin Press, 2005. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, with the gunmen reportedly being Vito Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis, and Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel; Ciro \\"The Artichoke King\\" Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver's seat by Siegel.Sifakis, (2005). pp. 87‚Äì88 Luciano took over Masseria's family, with Genovese as his underboss. In September 1931, Luciano and Genovese planned the murder of Salvatore Maranzano after Lucchese had previously alerted Luciano that he was marked for death, and prepared a hit team to kill Maranzano first. On September 10, 1931, when Maranzano summoned Luciano, Genovese, and Frank Costello to a meeting at his office, they knew Maranzano would kill them there. Instead, Luciano sent to Maranzano's office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano's people. They had been secured with the aid of Lansky and Siegel.\\"Lucky Luciano: Criminal Mastermind,\\" Time, Dec. 7, 1998 Luciano subsequently created The Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime. Underboss to Gagliano Due to Luciano's reforms, the New York city underworld entered a long period of peace. Luciano was soon arrested in 1936 on compulsory prostitution charges and then deported in 1946. Gagliano would keep his family during a tough time, being outnumbered in the Commission by an alliance of the Bonanno, Magaddino, Profaci and the Mangano families. From 1932 onward, Gagliano kept a very low profile; almost nothing is known about him from then onward. He preferred to issue his orders through close allies, particularly Lucchese, who was the family's public face. In 1946, Lucchese attended the mob Havana Conference in Cuba as Gagliano's representative. On January 25, 1943, Lucchese became a naturalized United States citizen in Newark, New Jersey. Lucchese formed an alliance with Louis Buchalter and together they controlled the garment district.Ryan, p.118 Boss of the family In 1951, Gagliano died of natural causes. As underboss and de facto street boss for two decades, Lucchese was the obvious successor, and the family was quickly renamed the Lucchese crime family. Lucchese appointed mobsters Stafano LaSalle as underboss and Vincenzo Rao as consigliere. That same year, Lucchese formed an alliance with Luciano crime family underboss Vito Genovese and Anastasia crime family underboss Carlo Gambino with the long-term goal of gaining control of the Commission. Lucchese became one of the most well-respected Cosa Nostra bosses of the Post- War era. He maintained close relationships with New York City politicians, including Mayors William O'Dwyer and Vincent Impellitteri. Lucchese concentrated on the core Cosa Nostra values of making money, keeping a low public profile, and avoiding criminal prosecution. The Lucchese family came to dominate Manhattan's garment district and the related trucking industry by gaining control of key unions and trade associations. Alliance with Gambino and Genovese On November 17, 1952, U.S. Attorney General James P. McGranery initiated denaturalization proceedings against Lucchese. In its filing, the government claimed that Lucchese did not reveal his entire arrest record when applying for citizenship in the 1930s. In 1957, Lucchese and his allies decided to attack the bosses of the Luciano and Anastasia crime families to gain Commission control. On May 3, 1957, gunman Vincent Gigante wounded Luciano's street boss Frank Costello. Shaken by the assassination attempt, Costello soon retired, leaving Genovese as boss. On October 25, 1957, Albert Anastasia was assassinated in a hotel barbershop; Carlo Gambino became the new family boss. In 1957, Genovese called a national mob meeting to legitimize his control of the Luciano family. The meeting was held at rural home of mobster Joseph \\"Joe the Barber\\" Barbara in Apalachin, New York. On November 14, 1957, the New York State Police raided the meeting and arrested 61 fleeing gangsters. Lucchese had not yet arrived in Apalachin and therefore avoided arrest. However, his consigliere Vincenzo Rao, Gambino, Genovese and other mob leaders were detained. Genovese's humiliation motivated the new alliance of Luciano, Costello, Lansky, Gambino and Lucchese to set up Genovese's later elimination. Two years later, with the help of the alliance, Genovese was arrested on narcotics trafficking charges. Genovese was convicted and sent to prison, where he died in 1969. With the alliance backing him, Gambino now controlled the Commission. On April 8, 1958, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1952 denaturalization ruling against Lucchese on a legal technicality. However, the next day, U.S. Attorney General William P. Rogers brought a new case against Lucchese. Lucchese and Gambino In 1962, Carlo Gambino's oldest son, Thomas Gambino, married Lucchese's daughter Frances.The Gambino Crime Family ‚Äî A Squirrel of a Man ‚Äî Crime Library on truTV.com Over 1,000 guests attended the wedding, at which Carlo Gambino presented Lucchese with a $30,000 gift. In return, Lucchese gave Gambino a part of his rackets at Idlewild Airport (now called John F. Kennedy Airport). Lucchese exercised control over airport management security and all the airport unions. As a team, Lucchese and Gambino now controlled the airport, the Commission, and most organized crime in New York City. Commission plot In 1963, Joseph Magliocco and Bonanno boss Joseph Bonanno hatched an audacious plan to murder Commission bosses Carlo Gambino, Lucchese, Stefano Magaddino, as well as Frank DeSimone, and take over the Mafia Commission.Staff (September 1, 1967) \\"The Mob: How Joe Bonanno Schemed to kill ‚Äì and lost\\" Life p.15-21 Joseph Magliocco gave the murder contact to Joseph Colombo. Colombo either feared for his life, or sensed an opportunity for advancement, and instead reported the plot to The Commission. The Commission, realizing that Bonanno was the real mastermind, ordered both Magliocco and Bonanno to explain. Bonanno went into hiding in Montreal, but a badly shaken Magliocco appeared and confessed everything; he was fined $50,000 and forced into retirement. Death and burial Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal On July 13, 1967, Lucchese died of a brain tumor at his home in the Lido Beach area of Long Island. The funeral service was held at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church in Point Lookout, NY. Lucchese is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York. Over 1,000 mourners, including politicians, judges, policemen, racketeers, drug pushers, pimps, and hitmen attended the ceremony. Undercover policemen photographed the attendees. At the time of his death, he had not spent a day in jail in 44 years. Lucchese's first choice as a successor had been Antonio \\"Tony Ducks\\" Corallo, but Corallo was in prison when Lucchese died. Lucchese's second choice, Ettore Coco, was also in legal trouble and served a short time as boss. Another possible candidate was consigliere Vincenzo Rao, but he too was dealing with criminal charges. The Commission finally selected capo Carmine Tramunti as temporary acting boss until Corallo was released from prison.

It was built on top of the ruins of a 13th century castle thought to belong to Ifor Bach, a local Welsh ruler. It was rebuilt and transformed in the late 1870s into a fantasy castle by William Burges for the 3rd Marquess of Bute.  Places of worship  There is a parish church and two Nonconformist chapels still open to worshippers in the village: *St Michael and All Angels (Church in Wales) (built 1875-77) *Ainon Baptist Church (built 1832) *Bethesda United Reformed Church (built 1861) There were once two other chapels in the village (both Nonconformist), which have since closed and been converted into private residences.  Music  The band RocketGoldStar wrote a song about the village, recording it on their 1996 album. They recorded it for a BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale Session. Tongwynlais Brass Band has been in existence since the 19th century and continues to compete in national competitions as well as performing concerts. Castell Coch Choral Society also does a lot of charitable work and has recently performed in the Czech Republic. The Welsh glam metal band Tigertailz named a song on Disc 1 of their Thrill Pistol album \\"Tongwynlais Fly\\". Images File:Castellcoch2.JPGCastell Coch in autumn.  References  Hutton, J.

The series introduced the character of Bill Savage, a classic anti- authoritarian character of the type which Mills is best known for. It has been continued in the sequel series Savage, beginning in 2004, by Pat Mills and Charlie Adlard. Alternate historical background In the alternate recent history established in Savage, the Soviet Union fell to a fascist military coup and was renamed the Volgan Republic by Marshal Vashkov in 1991. In 1992, vast new reserves of North Sea oil were discovered off the coast of Britain. Ken Livingstone became head of the Labour Party, and his \\"True Labour\\" movement gained power over Shirley Brown's Conservative Party in a 1995 general election. In 1996, Prime Minister Livingstone ordered the removal of all American military bases from the British Isles; by 1998, a newly isolationist United States had withdrawn completely from Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). By 1999, Prince Charles was King of the United Kingdom. The United States and Volgan Republic had a secret agreement, carving up the world into spheres of influence. Meanwhile, a fifth column among the establishment, feeling threatened by the new left-wing government, made overtures to the Volgans, offering to help with any invasion.Prog 1450, Savage Book 2 Part one Synopsis =Invasion!= Set in the year 1999, the first part of the series depicts Western Europe and the United Kingdom's being swiftly overrun by an invasion from the Volgan Republic known as the Eight- Hour War. North Sea oil rigs are seized by helicopter-borne commando units; Heathrow airport is captured by paratroopers, allowing heavy transport planes to land delivering heavy armour close to London; and the Midlands are hit by nuclear weapons, including a 50 megaton warhead. The UK Government capitulates, with many hard line anti-Volgan MPs, Lords, and generals along with Prime Minister Shirley Brown being executed; a puppet government, under Prime Minister Simon Creepton, takes control for the puppet state of The People's Republic of Britain. Bill Savage, an East-End lorry driver, begins a one-man resistance movement against the Volgans after his wife and children are killed when Savage's home is hit by a Volgan tank shell during the invasion. As with similar characters that Mills and Day had created for other titles (such as Action and Battle Picture Weekly), Savage is given a gimmick, his preferred weapons: a hauling hook and a sawn-off shotgun. Initially solo, he is recruited by Lt. Peter Silk into the British resistance. Initially leading the Mad Dogs cell out of the Isle of Dogs, Savage would later be mobile and take part in resistance action throughout the country. Throughout the series, Savage's brutal violence and working-class common sense lead to victory, whereas military resistance is depicted as being class bound and ineffectual. At the end of the series, Savage is tasked with taking the heir to the throne, Prince John, to safety in Canada. He smuggled the prince into North America on a US cargo ship; as Volgan agents murdered most of the crew trying to stop him, the series ended with Savage believing the United States would now get involved against the Volgans. The Volgan War (AKA the Fourth Oil War) became part of a connecting back story for a number of 2000 AD series including ABC Warriors. =Savage= In the sequel series Savage, the Volgans are still in command in 2004 and are being opposed by terrorist insurgent groups like the Free European Army and Traitor's Gate. Escapist fiction like Lord Cyboid and the Silver Rapier is abundant, produced by the Volgans to pacify the general public; propaganda campaigns try to convince people to accept the occupation and not be \\"bitter-enders\\". Some people have come to accept the occupation or actively collaborate with it; they are described as \\"Double Yellows\\", after the twin yellow stripes on the uniforms of the British State Security agents and police officers who collaborate with the Volgan regime. Despite the non-aggression agreement with the United States, American small arms and other weapons are used by resistance movements. Savage also has a CIA contact, and the two share information against the Volgans. Any major activity, however, is not taken and occupied Britain does not seem a high priority. (They would also be caught off-guard and be left out in the 2004 uprising.) Under the direction of Savage, the resistance manages to almost force the Volgan peacekeepers to withdraw from Britain in 2004, though they manage to cling to power and send renewed troop numbers in. Subsequently, Savage assassinated Vashkov. Consequently, State Security agents retaliate by murdering Savage's brother Tom after discovering he had secretly written stories that would be embarrassing to the regime. Savage and his sister Cassie kill all of the agents responsible, only it is discovered that Savage's former-MI6 resistance contact had been behind it and was secretly a collaborator. Savage then kills him and his security team and posts a copy of his brother's work on the Internet. As a result, the resistance, alongside the population, rises up against the Volgan \\"peacekeepers\\" and liberates most of Southern England. Book Four, however, opens with the country re-occupied after 2006, when a fresh surge of troops is deployed. By now, some people in Britain are coming to accept Volgan rule. the United States, however, is now heavily outfitting resistance units with American weaponry and preparing to use Ireland as a staging ground for a liberation. Savage prevents the Volgans from causing a fake terrorist atrocity to drive off the Americans, and by 2009 the Allied forces are openly bombing Volgan targets in London. They also used electromagnetic weapons to \\"e-bomb\\" the city, wiping out most electronics and reducing it to a 1984 level of technology; many citizens are disgruntled, wondering why the Americans are not bombing the Volgans. 2009 also sees the liberation of Britain begin, with army robots being used as the advance wave at Fishguard. The Volgans develop a teleport machine that sends their troops into the American bases to kill the commanding officers. Luckily, Bill Savage and some of the resistance destroy the base in London but they use it once to put a Siberian tiger in a Volgan General's tank. The Volgans have started creating their own battle robots called Mark 1 Blackblood robots. Bill Savage finds two American pilots, who escaped from a Volgan P.O.W camp, in Siberia; they tell him they have found a secret city underground called Ugelgorsk, where the Volgans are building Mark 1 Blackblood robots and planning to use them in Wales, then Ireland. Bill and his accomplices now have to get the pilots to Liverpool's coast, where there will be a boat to take them to Dublin. They succeed, and Bill is later told that three U.S long-range bombers have destroyed Ugelgorsk and most of the Mark 1 Blackblood robots. Bill Savage feels happy, saying it is only a matter of time before the Allies break through the Welsh Front and liberate Britain. 2010 however The Welsh Front is still a stalemate between The Allies and The Volgans, in a council flat in the East End of London Savage (disguised as a Volgan peacekeeper) kills a Volgan collaborator and his family and make people believe he's dead, in his cafe he is informed by his accomplice that Quartz has created an army of Mark Two Hammerstines better than the Mark One Hammerstines who kept killing everything in sight and can't tell friend from foe, but Savage has new instructions, he is to go to Allied HQ in Dublin where he will be given instructions at a certain time where he will lead all the resistance groups and liberate London. In Ireland Bill Savage meets Howard Quartz in an abandoned Dublin housing estate watching the new Mark Two Hammerstein in training, Quartz show him they will only attack Mark 1 Blackbloods and Volgan Soldiers, In Dublin Castle the Allied military staff say that he has done well uniting the resistance groups and the dangerous street gangs, even the notorious gangs like The Tolpuddle Gang who are opposed to The Royal Family's return, are also helping, Quartz arrives and tells him the President has his instructions that he will return to London and prepare for the liberation. He himself must not be involved in the fighting because all the resistance groups look up to him and it might ruin the resistance if he is killed, understanding he goes back to London and prepares for liberation. Allied Robots have now retaken Cardiff and seized Bristol, there have been further landings in Liverpool and Glasgow, King Charles The Third has sent a message from Canada saying this is the Supreme Test for the British people he said he and his wife, Queen Diana were Praying for the liberation, President Dick Quartz tells them that this is still no time to celebrate, in London the British Resistance groups are causing havoc for the Volgans, In his Cafe Bill Savage prepares to fight, but his sister said that he promised General Woodhouse that he wouldn't take part, but he tells her that ever since Sheila and the kids died he was already dead, saying goodbye to his sister he joins his group and prepares to attack. Allied Robots are now advancing east towards the Oil Refinery Port, U.S Navy Seals have taken the North Sea Offshore Platforms preventing the Volgans from destroying them, Britain's newly discovered oil reserves are the third largest in the world and the reason why the Volgans invaded in 1999. The Volgans say the only reason the United States is liberating Britain is to seize the oil, Britain is about to be exploited by American Oil Companies under a secret new deal signed by the Provisional UK Government, which guarantees Quartz Oil HQ and Seven Sisters Oil gives a cheap crude for Thirty Years with up to seventy-five percent of the profits, critics say that Britain is being forced to surrender its independence once again, President Dick Quartz says that he is on a divine mission and his brother Howard Quartz that the Oil belongs to the British People, in London Allied Robots have reached Swindon and now British Resistance Groups and Volgan Soldiers are fighting for control for the Bridges Across The Thames. Bill Savage and his group are fighting in London, it soon comes clear that his group are protecting him because he is key to the resistance, but he says he will keep fighting, but whilst fighting he is spotted by a sniper. The Sniper is distracted in the defence fort when he is accused of stealing, however he soon gets back to work and nearly kills Savage but a member of the resistance jumps in the way, Savage and the group open fire on the fort, looking up in the sky the Volgan soldiers see the Volgan Air Force is returning to Siberia, depressed they ask their female Sergeant to sing, she does and the British Resisters start singing along until Savage tells them to stop, saying they are fraternizing with the enemy, they tell Savage although they are the enemy they're still Human Beings, Savage says there not Human there Volgans. In an attempt to prevent the Hammersteins reaching London The Volgans destroy Tower Bridge, Westminster Bridge and are about to destroy Waterloo Bridge until Savage drives a car into them filled with H.E then he and his group massacre The Volgans and now have to hold the bridge until the Hammerstines get there. The British Resistance groups now are all meeting at Waterloo Bridge celebrating, however Savage is more cynical saying they will soon be taking orders from the Americans because they are the new invaders and the reason they were invaded in 1999 was because they Britain want to do what the British wanted to do. Bad news arrives when he is told that the Mark Two Hammersteins have screwed up because on their way to London the Volgans were using Virginia Water as a fort and the Hammersteins programming told them that because of the houses property values they were too expensive to destroy so they surrendered and were destroyed by a bulldozer reprogrammed by The Volgans. Even worse the Volgans in London are Counter- Attacking. A Volgan T20 Tank tries to destroy the bridge but Savage destroys the Tank with a Heat Seeking rocket launcher, afterwards he meets the Leaders of the Tolpuddle Gang who say they think Howard Quartz deliberately sent faulty Hammersteins to give the British Resistance false hope and attack without U.S support so The Volgans would wipe them out and anyone who thinks the Oil is rightfully the British People's and not Quartz Oil's, and say Savage has betrayed them all. As The Tolpuddle Gang leave the fort Savage and the rest prepare to defend, seeing the housing estates where The Volgans are massacring everyone in sight. In the ruins of another fort the surviving Volgan from Waterloo Bridge are hiding, one of them a conspiracy theorist, says the V in their National Flag is the symbol of the Freemasonry, saying Stalin was secretly financed by Henry Ford and the American banks, and Vashkov was financed by the Quartz Brothers because they were members of the secret Skull Club, they ask if they were both friends why are they now enemy's the soldier replies because the Quartz's main income is the weapon industry, they need war to make a profit, and say the world would be a better place without them. Bill Savage, now depressed thinking when Britain is liberated it will be rebuilt in Quartz image saying they have swapped one invader for another, Volgans try to negotiate with Savage saying if the resistance surrenders they will be treated as prisoners of war, Savage says they will fight until they die. In the council flats the British Resistance is now pushing back Volgan soldiers, Major General Rankov tells the officer attacking Waterloo Bridge that Savage is still alive and leading the resistance and that there can be no prisoners and they must destroy Waterloo Bridge, meanwhile Savage plans to get revenge on The Sniper. 10 Months before the liberation Major General Rankov is talking to a collaborator saying he and the others are going to be turned into Cyborgs to help the Volgan war effort. Meanwhile, in the present time the British Resistance prepare to make a last stand at Waterloo Bridge when suddenly Quartz Raptor Drones come and push the Volgans back also the Hammersteins have reached Peckham thinking the wars over when suddenly the Raptor Drones turn on the resistance Savage realises that Quartz has betrayed them. Savage manages to save the Resistance by standing in front of the Raptor Drones which have been programmed not to kill him the Hammersteins have taken London after eleven years of Volgan occupation Britain has finally been liberated. In Buckingham Palace Volgan Generals sign the unconditional surrender to the Allies, Savage questions Quartz about the Raptor Drones and Hammersteins failing at points Quartz put it down to errors, even thought Savage doesn't believe him, Savage is looking forward to the return of The Royal Family. Quartz tells him the King has just abdicated The Royal Family won't be returning and Britain is about to become a Republic Quartz explains that The Tolpuddle Gang now calling themselves the True Democracy Party has the public backing, and Savage is in a way also to blame in that he is a working-class hero who defeated the Volgans, Savage says he is a Royalist through and through, Quartz explains nevertheless they have to accept it. Six months later Savage has given up fighting and is in his Sisters Cafe drinking coffee, on the news there is a protest outside the American Embassy because the highest and lowest paying jobs are going to Robots and not the people and that the Raptor Drones are monitoring the country and that the Hammersteins are allowed to use minimal force against the people, Savage decides to go to the protest, the Hammersteins warn the protesters to dispense, the protesters believe that they will only use plastic bullets but Savage doesn't believe it Hammersteins open fire on the protesters, Savage manages to grab on to one in panic the control orders the Hammerstein to obey Savage, Savage orders it to attack the other Hammersteins, during this Savage is kidnapped by Volgan collaborators and taken to an underground car park were someone is waiting to see him. The collaborators are Cyborgs who believe they will lead Humanity to a new age, it is revealed that their leader is Jack Savage, Bill's brother, believed dead after the Volgans nuked the midlands, Jack says they are not Volgan collaborators and is about to tell Bill what he has been doing. In 1999 Jack is in his Pub when his stepson Viktor tells him his mum Zoya wants to see him, Zoyas husband, Brendan was killed during a bank robbery that he and Jack were doing, back at his house Zoya tells him that a war between Britain and the Volgans is about to begin. She tells him that she is an Agent for the Volgan Security Service and they must leave immediately, when they are one hundred and fifty miles away, they are safe from the blast, Zoya tells him because he is ruthless she would like him to be an interrogator for when the Volgans take over, Jack accepts. Back in 2010 Jack tells him he couldn't contact them for their safety but hasn't told him what happened in 1999, Bill and Jack embrace. Jack tells Bill that he has joined Stop The Robots campaign because people are scared of them, Jack tells Bill he is the only one who can stop them. Later Bill is talking to Howard Quartz about the parade that is going to happen, they are temporarily cut off the Quartz brothers start taking about how to stop the True Democracy Party from coming to power saying they need Bill Savage to speak out against them. In London Jack savage and his gang hack into the Prime Minister car and make it crash and they have order from Rankov to get rid of Bill, Jack says he will deal with Bill In their sister's Cafe Bill and Jack talk about the parade; Bill does not trust Jack. During the parade Howard Quartz is secretly talking to Bill who has his gang secretly monitoring the parade suddenly they see someone acting suspiciously, suddenly the Hammersteins turn on the parade, Thought the Army manages to get the Hammerstines back under control, the Cyborgs hack into the Raptor Drones,Bill and his team kill the Cyborgs, however doesn't stop one Hammerstine from killing Howard Quartz, now Bill plans to kill Jack. Bill finds Jack in Buckingham Palace, Jack tells Bill the only reason he survived because he looked after him, Bill tells him the Hammersitnes are back under control, Jack tells him he has the Raptor Drones now, Bill and Jack begin to fight. With the Raptor Drones back under control and kill Jack, Three months later the True Democracy Party are in charge and have had the Raptor Drones removed. In a secret location, doctors have saved Howard Quartz brain and put it in a machine, his brother is determined to save him Howard Quartz begins to speak and plans revenge on Bill Savage. Bill Savage is talking with the Prime Minister saying he is planning to help liberate the rest of Europe, meanwhile back at the White House Howard Quartz brain has been put in a robotic suite (becoming as he's seen in ABC Warriors) hearing that Savage is going to Europe he sees his chance for revenge. In 2015, Savage now living in Volgan occupied Germany, runs The Butchers Hook Mittie in Berlin, he discovers the Volgans have something called The Thousand Year Star, that could change the war, and the only one who knows what it is a Graffiti Artist called Wolfie Vos, a member of the Edelweiss Pirates, and somewhere call Beelitz Sanatorium is where it was made.

Savage also discovers that Howard Quartz is still alive and has been selling weapons to both sides. The weapons of Bill Savage When Invasion! started, Bill Savage was armed with a double-barreled side-by-side shotgun. After getting into contact with the British Resistance, he was given a pump- action shotgun. Throughout the original series and in the new Savage series, Bill Savage is shown to be skilled in the use of various types of firearms ‚Äì both friendly and enemy The various firearms Bill Savage uses in the Invasion! and Savage series comics, besides his tried and trusted double-barreled side- by-side shotgun, are: * Various types of AK rifles the Volgan Army uses * The Beretta Model 92FS pistol (as seen in Savage: Taking Liberties, in which he used this in conjunction with his pump-action shotgun) * The Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun * The Kalashnikov AKSU-74 assault rifle (as seen in the recent Savage series) * The L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle 7.62.mm automatic rifle (as Invasion was published in 1977, the writers had no idea that by 1999 the British Army would be using the L85 series of 5.56.mm rifles) * The Remington Model 870 pump-action shotgun (the pump-action shotgun Bill Savage uses resembles the Remington Model 870) Soviets/Volgans The Volgans were originally intended to be the Soviets, but IPC's management forced a last- minute change to a fictional group for fear of offending the Soviets.Thrill Power Overload by David Bishop; Judge Dredd Megazine #4.09 Savage portrays the Volgans as Russians, following a name change.

Cardiff City Rodrigues was born in Cardiff, Wales, and originally turned out for his local schools. He went on to be selected for both Cardiff Schoolboys and for Welsh schoolboys, before signing for Cardiff City as a professional in May 1961. Rodrigues almost left the side before ever making a professional appearance for the club when Newport County offered ¬£500 to take him to Somerton Park, but the offer was turned down by Cardiff. He went on to make his debut in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Southampton in September 1963, and for the next three seasons he was virtually ever-present in the side. But Rodrigues was unhappy with the standard of football at the club and decided to leave. Leicester City and Sheffield Wednesday Rodrigues was signed by Leicester City in December 1965, to fill the right back position, moving John Sjoberg into the centre of the field. He was an established Welsh international when he arrived at City for a club record fee of ¬£42,500. Rodrigues' attacking full back play set a standard to City's play in the next decade and when Steve Whitworth replaced Rodrigues he played with the same passion to go forward. Rodrigues was a fine over- lapping full-back who was renowned for his sliding tackles. Rodrigues made 139 league appearances for Leicester scoring 6 goals, plus a further 29 cup appearances including City's losing 1969 FA Cup final, before leaving to join Sheffield Wednesday in October 1970. Southampton Rodrigues was signed on a free transfer by Southampton at the age of 30 in 1975, after being released from his contract by Sheffield Wednesday. The Welsh international full-back was signed by Lawrie McMenemy as cover for Steve Mills, who had been injured in a car crash and was out of action for a lengthy period of time. Rodrigues' first season at The Dell could not have been better, with the side winning their first and only FA Cup. Rodrigues played at right-back in the Wembley final, where Southampton beat Manchester United 1‚Äì0. However, Rodrigues' second year at The Dell saw his playing days ended with a persistent knee injury. He made 59 league appearances for Saints scoring 3 goals, plus a further 13 cup and other appearances. Retirement After retirement from football Rodrigues became the landlord of the King Rufus pub in Eling. In 1987, Rodrigues moved back to Wales to take over another pub and set up a soccer school in Tenby. He later returned to Southampton to manage the Conservative Club, where he stayed for 8 years until the death of his wife, Lin. In 2002, Rodrigues moved to Alicante in Spain for a few years, but after remarrying (to Kate) he settled back in Southampton, where he worked as a driver. In October 2004, Rodrigues' eldest daughter placed his FA Cup winner's medal up for auction without his knowledge. The medal sold for ¬£10,200 and was initially said to have been purchased by a mystery bidder, but it was subsequently announced that the medal had been purchased by Southampton Football Club.

Traditionally it is an alcohol based liquid (splash), but it can be a lotion, gel, or even a paste. It often contains an antiseptic agent such as denatured alcohol, stearate citrate or witch hazel to prevent infection of cuts, as well as to act as an astringent to reduce skin irritation. Menthol is used in some varieties as well to numb irritated skin. An alcohol-based aftershave usually causes an immediate stinging sensation after applying it post-shave, with effects sometimes lasting several minutes, but most commonly only for seconds. For this reason, a market consisting of highly differentiated products has been created‚Äîsome using alcohols, some not. Aftershave balms are frequently recommended for winter use as they tend to be alcohol free and lotion-like, moisturizing the skin. Some aftershaves use fragrance or essential oil to enhance scent. Moisturizers‚Äînatural and artificial, are often touted as able to soften the skin. Aftershave is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Eau de Cologne due to the very similar nature of the two products. Some aftershave manufacturers encourage using their fragranced aftershave as if it were cologne, in order to increase sales by encouraging consumers to use it in a more versatile manner, rather than just after a shaving session. Some aftershaves were inspired by a cologne. Early aftershaves included witch-hazel and bay rum, and have been documented in shaving guides. Both still are sold as aftershaves.

Chadwick was the Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and the founder and head of what is today known as the Department of Anglo- Saxon, Norse and Celtic at the University of Cambridge. He was well known for his encouragement of interdisciplinary research on Celts and Germanic peoples, and for his theories on the Heroic Age in the history of human societies. Chadwick was the author of numerous influential works in his fields of study. Family Hector Munro Chadwick was born in Thornhill Lees, Yorkshire, England on 22 October 1870, the third son of Reverend Edward Chadwick and Sarah Anne Bates. The Chadwick family traced its descent from John Chadwick of Chadwick Hall, Rochdale, who flourished during the reign of Elizabeth I. Edward was the seventh of the eight sons of James Chadwick, who in turn was a son of yet another John Chadwick. John and his sons were all members of the firm of John Chadwick & Sons, who were flannel manufacturers in Rochdale. The firm had a branch in Edinburgh, and it was there that James married Sarah Murray, daughter of George Murray and Margaret Munro, who was probably a sister of General Hector Munro. Sarah Murray was descended from Scottish Highlanders. Edward Chadwick was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, and met Sarah while he was Curate at Church of St George, Chester Road, Hulme. Sarah was the only daughter and one of eight children of an Oldham businessman of considerable prominence. Her grandfather was a member of the same business. Her cousin, Captain Chadwick, had served with distinction in the Crimean War. Sarah's father retired early from business, and subsequently became a farmer at Old Trafford. Sarah's mother died on the day in which Sarah was to marry Edward Chadwick, allegedly heartbroken over the prospect of losing contact with her daughter. The marriage was subsequently postponed for a while. After finally marrying, Edward and Sarah spent their early years at Blue Pits, where their eldest son Edward was born. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to Thornhill Lees, Yorkshire, where Edward Chadwick senior became a close friend to a member of the Bibby family, which owned the Bibby Line. The Bibby's built a church for Edward in the suburbs of Thornhill Lees, where he became Vicar. It was during this time that the Chadwicks had their three remaining children, Dora, Murray, and then Hector. Edward ended his career as Rural Dean of Dewsbury, and his two oldest sons also joined the priesthood of the Church of England. Early life and education Entrance to Clare College, Cambridge, where Chadwick received his education in Classics. Hector was by far the youngest child of the family, and had a very close relationship with his sister. Dora taught him both letters and Latin, and he would later say that she \\"brought me up\\". Chadwick's father strongly encouraged his children to study, and used to tell Hector that a bear would come an carry him off if he did not learn his Latin. As a result, one of Chadwick's earliest memories were peering for the bear through a window near the vicarage's front door. Chadwick attended Bradford Grammar School from 1882 to 1883. At Bradford he showed himself a gifted student, but did not like school life, and often feigned sickness in order to stay home from school. In 1884 he was tutored at home by his sister and the curators. From 1885 to 1889, Chadwick attended Wakefield Grammar School as a day-boy. Chadwick commuted 8 miles to Wakefield each day, during which he learned German by himself. At Wakefield, Chadwick was a passionate player of tennis, and served as treasurer of the school cricket club. Contemporary students at Wakefield would later describe him as a determined but shy boy, who happily helped out his classmates with their Latin. Shyness, intelligence, determination and a strong willingness to help others were personality traits which were to characterize Chadwick into adulthood. Upon leading Wakefield in 1889, Chadwick obtained a Cave Exhibition at Clare College, Cambridge. That summer, Chadwick made a trip to Scotland, Ulster, Wales and the Isle of Man. He subsequently did his Little Go and entered Cambridge. While an undergraduate, Chadwick made memorable visits to Continental Europe with his brother Edward, during which they made a notable visit to Austria and Italy. In 1890, Chadwick was elected Classical Scholar at Clare. In 1892, Chadwick obtained a First Class, Division 3 of Part I of the Classical Tripos, and gained his B.A.. The next year (1893), Chadwick obtained a First Class with distinction in Part II, Section E (Philology) of the Classical Tripos. From 1893 to 1899, Chadwick was a Fellow at Clare College, Cambridge. In 1894, his \\"The Origin of the Latin Perfect Formation in -ui\\" was published in Adalbert Bezzenberger's Beitrage zur Kunde der indo-germanischen Sprachen. It was during this time, when visiting his brother Murray, that Chadwick came upon Paul Du Chaillu's The Viking Age. Through this book, Chadwick gained a strong interest in the early civilizations of Northern Europe. The book was characterized by an interdisciplinary approach to every aspect of its subject, which was an approach which was also to characterize Chadwick's future teaching and research. In the summer of 1895, Chadwick attended lectures at the University of Freiburg under Wilhelm Streitberg. Early career Odin in the guise of a wanderer, by Georg von Rosen (1886). Chadwick's first book, The Cult of Othin, examined worship of Odin among the Germanic peoples. Returning to Cambridge in 1895, Chadwick taught Old English for Section B of the Medieval and Modern Languages Tripos, while devoting himself to the study of the early North. He gained his M.A. in 1896. Section B had been established in 1894, and its teachers at the time included Israel Gollancz and George Campbell Macaulay. Its Chair was Walter William Skeat, the Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon. Skeat was primarily concerned with the study of Middle English. Section B was at the almost entirely limited to linguistic study, and attracted few students, which however included future distinguished scholars such as Allen Mawer. Chadwick was quickly recognized as a highly gifted tutor. His lectures were conducted in an informal manner, and Chadwick was particularly noted for his supervisions, which he began giving his students individually while they were still undergraduates. Many a student of Chadwick would later describe these supervisions at Chadwick's home as formative events in their scholarly careers. Chadwick gained a large and loyal following among his students, who gave him him the pet name \\"Chadders\\". Many of his students were female, and Chadwick insisted that they were to be treated equally with their male peers, which was quite uncommon at English universities at the time. Chadwick treated his students as his intellectual peers, which sometimes resulted in him recommending them subjects which were beyond their capabilities. A large number of Chadwick's students would come to hold prominent positions in academia, with around thirty of them being appointed at university posts, not to mention the large amount of museum officials, librarians and other learned individuals of prominence who had studied under him. From 1899 to 1919, Chadwick became solely responsible for teaching at the Section B of the Medieval and Modern Languages Tripos. In 1899, no less than three works by Chadwick were published: \\"Ablaut problems in the Indo-Germanic Verb\\" in Indogermanische Forschungen, \\"Studies in Old English\\" in Transactions of the Cambridge Philological Society, and his first book, The Cult of Othin, which was published by Cambridge University Press. His \\"Studies in Old English\\" was a pioneering monograph on dialects and sound changes in Old English. In The Cult of Othin, Chadwick examined worship of Odin among the Germanic peoples. The book took all relevant evidence into consideration, including linguistic, literary, and archaeological evidence, which was to become a typical feature of Chadwick's scholarly approach. In conclusion, Chadwick argued that worship of Odin was in all essential features the same among all the Germanic peoples, including Anglo-Saxons and Norse peoples. In 1899, his Fellowship at Clare was renewed. In 1900, two important papers by Chadwick, \\"The Oak and the Thunder-God\\" and \\"The Ancient Teutonic Priesthood\\", appeared in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute and in Folk-Lore. From 1903 to 1911, Chadwick was Librarian at the College. In 1905, Chadwick published Studies in Anglo-Saxon Institutions. It was at the time considered the best work ever published on Anglo-Saxon society, and was highly influential. In 1907, Chadwick contributed chapter III on \\"Early National Poetry\\" to the first volume of the Cambridge History of English Literature. The same year saw the publishing of his monumental The Origins of the English Nation (1907). Investigating the origins of the Anglo-Saxons and the English people, this work has been highly praised for its interdisciplinary combination of archaeological, historical and philological evidence from both England and Northern Europe. In 1907, the scope of Section B at the Medieval and Modern Languages Tripos was broadened to cover Anglo-Saxon, Germanic and Viking Age history, culture and religion. Upon a 1909 recommendation of the board of medieval and modern languages at Cambridge, Chadwick was in 1910 appointed Lecturer in Scandinavian at Cambridge, holding this position for two years. The Heroic Age Vendel Period (Germanic Iron Age) helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities. In his The Heroic Age, Chadwick postulated the existence of a Germanic Heroic Age in this period, analogous to the Greek Heroic Age. In 1912, Chadwick published The Heroic Age, which is considered one of his most important works. In this work Chadwick conducted a pioneering examination of parallels between the epic poetry of the Greek Heroic Age and the Germanic Heroic Age. Celtic, Roman and Slavic epic poetry was also considered, which testifies to the wide and diverse knowledge possessed by Chadwick at this time. Chadwick postulated the Heroic Age as a distinct period in the history of numerous human societies. During such Heroic Ages, warrior aristocrats figure prominently, and courage and martial prowess is valued above all else. For Chadwick, such an Heroic Age was not one of primitiveness, but rather one of youthfulness, vigor and rebellion. According to Chadwick, Heroic Ages typically emerged when tribal societies came into close contact with more advanced civilizations, such as when the Germanic peoples encountered ancient Rome. Notably, Chadwick postulated the existence of Heroic Ages also among Celts and Slavs. The Heroic Age attracted strong interests from both Claccisists and Germanicists. It remains a pioneering work of comparative literature. Leadership and reform at Cambridge Upon the death of Skeat in 1912, Chadwick was recognized as the obvious successor, and was subsequently elected Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge. He would continue to hold this position until reaching the age limit in 1941. Chadwick's election to this professorship marks a new phase in his career, during which his time would be mostly be dedicated to teaching and administrative work. In agreement with previous wishes expressed by Skeat, Chadwick sought to broaden the scope of the Section beyond the field of philology, and make it concerned not only with the study of Anglo-Saxons, but rather the study of all Germanic peoples, and to the study of the Celts. By this time, Chadwick had come to see philology not as an object in itself, but rather as a key to the early history of the Germanic peoples, and the English people in particular. Although encountering significant opposition, Chadwick's efforts at reform were successful through a 1917 changing of regulations, which he drew up by himself. The scope of the department would subsequently extend well beyond language and literature, to include history, archaeology and the study of culture, including religion and social institutions. Chadwick's reforms at Cambridge were not limited to Section B. With his friends Professor Arthur Quiller-Couch and Dr. Hugh Fraser Stewart, Chadwick remodeled Section A (English studies) and transformed the Medieval and Modern Language Tripos in the Modern and Medieval Languages Tripos, in which English became a more or less independent course covered in sections A and B. The reforms encountered significant opposition, most notably by certain members of the English Association, but through his tenacity, persuasiveness and strategic skills, Chadwick able to outmaneuver his conservative critics, and his reforms were subsequently successfully implemented. Among Chadwick's few publications during his early years as an university administrator was his \\"Some German River-names\\", a philological study examined the origins of the Celts, which was published in Essays and Studies presented to William Ridgeway (1913). Chadwick accepted the reduction in his literary output without regret, because he considered teaching and directing his students to be a task of even greater importance than his written work. World War I and continued reform Portrait of Old Norse studies scholar Bertha Phillpotts, a former pupil of Chadwick who joined the faculty of his Department for Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies at Cambridge. Chadwick is well remembered for his adherence to gender equality, and encouraging women to pursue academic careers. The premature death of Phillpots in 1932 was a great loss for him. In the years of World War I, there was general understanding that British scholarship had devoted too much effort on the study of languages as compared to the people who spoke them. As a result, the importance of philology for the study of history and culture, particularly in the field of English studies, was increasingly emphasized. Chadwick was the dominant figure in this effort. Chadwick received an honorary D.Litt from Durham University in 1914, and an honorary LL.D from the University of St Andrews in 1919. Chadwick married Nora Kershaw, a former student of his, on 4 May 1922. Nora would eventually become a Fellow at Newnham College, Cambridge, and an intimate scholarly companion of Chadwick. They would subsequently publish several influential works together. Nora was herself an accomplished philologist, in fact so accomplished that a reviewer of one of her works on Old English and Old Norse poetry wrongly mistook the work as being written by Hector. The Chadwicks settled in house in an old paper-mill outside of Cambridge, close to the Norman Leper Chapel, which came under their care. They were animal lovers, and kept a large number of cats and dogs which they named after personages in Beowulf and Norse mythology. With Nora as the driver, the Chadwicks would take students by car to see archaeological sites near Cambridge. They would also make long trips together to Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The Chadwicks bought a house at Vowchurch in the Golden Valley near Wales, where they would subsequently spend much time. Chadwick was proud of his Scottish ancestry, and had a passionate interest in all things Celtic. During the first years of its existence, Chadwick was almost entirely responsible for teaching at his rapidly growing Section B, but was admirably assisted by his wife. Former students of his who lectured at his section included Cyril Fox and Frederick Attenborough. In 1920, Chadwick and his Section B had lost its eminent Celticist Edmund Crosby Quiggin in 1920, and Nora subsequently in stepped for the deceased as a teacher of Irish, while Hector taught Welsh. Among their notable students were Kenneth H. Jackson, who would himself become an eminent Celticist in Chadwick's department. Chadwick was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1925. Following the Royal Commission on the Universities and the introduction of the Faculty system, Chadwick and his Section B acquired a permanent staff. Two lecturers were appointed in 1926, included his intimate friend and former student Bertha Phillpotts, widely recognized as one of England's foremost authorities in Old Norse studies. Her premature death in 1932 was keenly felt by Chadwick and his colleagues. In the late 1920s, Chadwick became increasingly interested in the fields of archaeology and anthropology. In 1927, Chadwick transferred his Section B to the new Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology, where it become known as the Department for Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies. Chadwick sought to make its courses into a broad independent discipline akin to the Classics. He was elected an Honorary Member of the in 1928. The Growth of Literature Although Chadwick had heavily concentrated on his university duties rather than his own writing after becoming Professor, Nora insisted that he begin writing again. Chadwick argued that his university work was more important, but Nora persisted, and eventually persuaded him into resuming writing after suggesting to him that they write a work together. This ushered in what Chadwick's student, friend and colleague Jose Maria de Navarro considers the final stage of Chadwick's career. The Chadwicks to continue in the line of research pursued by Chadwick in his The Heroic Age (1912). Their original intention was to conduct a comparative study of the literature, archaeology and general civilization of the Viking Age and Ancient Greece, to which they began collecting material in 1919. About this time however, Chadwick came upon Early Adventures in Persia, Susiana and Babylonia by Austen Henry Layard, in which the effect of the rectital of the Shahnameh on the followers of Mehemet Taki Khan is described. Impressed by the parallels of the Shahnameh with Greek epic poetry, the Chadwicks decided to broaden the scope of their project, which eventually came to encompass the oral literature of a large number of peoples. The resulting work, The Growth of Literature (1932-1940), was published in three volumes. The first volume was mostly written by Hector, and was concerned with the ancient oral literature of Europe, although Nora collected the material on Irish literature. The second volume was mostly written by Nora, although Chadwick wrote its sections of Slavic, Hebrew and Indian literature. The third volume was mostly written by Nora, and included sections on Tatar, Polynesian and African literature, while the concluding section summarizing all the material of the three volume written by Hector. The Chadwicks were proficient in nearly all of the languages of the literature covered in the book, and it took both literary, historical, philological, anthropological and archaeological evidence into account. It has been described as a pioneering and masterful study, and the finest work of Chadwick's career. Last years at Cambridge Replica of the Sutton Hoo helmet produced for the British Museum. Chadwick argued that the Sutton Hoo burial was of R√¶dwald of East Anglia. It was at his country home in Vowchurch that Chadwick began writing his Early Wales and the Saxon Penetration of the West, but the threat of a German invasion of England would eventually convince him to abandon the project in 1940, as he felt the looming prospect of a German invasion had too many parallels with the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. When World War II began in 1939, the Chadwicks moved to a new home at Adams Road. During the war, many younger members of the staff left University, and Chadwick once more conducted most of the teaching at his Department for Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies. In his notable \\"Who was he?\\", published in Antiquity in 1940, Chadwick examined the site of Sutton Hoo, and suggested that its magnificent burial was of R√¶dwald of East Anglia. Upon attaining the age limit in 1941, Chadwick retired as Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and became an Honorary Fellow at Clare College, but at the request of the university, he continued teaching as head of his Department. Chadwick was able to combine his leadership of the department with writing and research. In his The Study of Anglo-Saxon (1941), Chadwick surveyed the history and contemporary state of Anglo-Saxon studies. In this work, Chadwick argued in favor of an interdisciplinary method for the study of the Anglo- Saxons, and suggested that Anglo-Saxon studies should be split from the field of English studies and made into a distinct and broad discipline akin to the Classics. Both in his The Study of Anglo-Saxon, and his later \\"Why compulsory philology\\", which appeared in The Universities Quarterly for 1946 and was written at the request of the National Union of Students, Chadwick argued against the teaching of philology as a compulsory subject, and instead considered it best suited for post-graduate work. In view of this, some have suggested that Chadwick had grown to dislike philology, but Chadwick's ample use of philology in all of his later works suggests that he was still very much fond of it. Chadwick received an honorary D.Litt from the University of Oxford in 1943. Upon the election of his friend and former pupil Bruce Dickins as Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, Chadwick retired from teaching, satisfied that his department was now safely in good hands. Chadwick thought that the broad approach he advocated for Anglo-Saxon studies should also be applied to the study of foreign peoples. This idea was further elaborated by him in his The Nationalities of Europe and the Growth of National Ideologies (1945). The writing of this work was strongly connected the ongoing world war. Chadwick argued that the British Empire had not dedicated enough resources to the study of nationalities and their importance. Chadwick suggested the establishment of a government-sponsored Institute of Imperial and Foreign Studies to provide courses on the history, languages and literature of various countries. He believed such knowledge was indispensable for understanding the culture of any country. Chadwick's book presents a general survey of the varies nationalities in Europe from an archaeological, historical and philological perspective. He notably located the Celtic homeland somewhere in the Netherlands and northwest Germany. Much of the work is dedicated to the study of the origins and nature of German imperialism. In subsequent years, The Nationalities of Europe and the Growth of National Ideologies subsequently became an indispensable work aspiring members of the Foreign Office. Death and legacy In his final literary project, Chadwick sought through a combination of archaeological, historical and philological evidence to examine the early history of Scotland. Chadwick argued that the Pictish Chronicle and the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba were derived from two distinct oral traditions of the Gaels and Picts respectively. Chadwick suggested that the Pictish language was akin to Welsh, but that nevertheless been an early and significant Gaelic presence in early Scotland. Chadwick became gravely ill in February 1946, but subsequently recovered, and resumed writing on his final work. In subsequent months however, his illness reappeared. Chadwick died in his sleep at Evelyn Nursing Home, Trumpington Road, Cambridge on 2 January 1947. His final work was completed by Nora, and published by Cambridge University Press under the title Early Scotland: The Picts, the Scots and the Welsh of Southern Scotland' (1947). The Early Cultures of North-West Europe, a festschrift in Chadwick's honor edited by Cyril Fox and Bruce Dickins, his former students, was published in 1950 Under the leadership of his former pupil Dorothy Whitelock, Chadwick's Department for Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies was in 1967 merged back into the Faculty of English, eventually becoming known as the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. The H.M. Chadwick Lecture was established in 1990, and is given annually by a scholar who is invited to Cambridge for the occasion. Chadwick left a long-lasting impact on subsequent scholarship. Christopher N. L. Brooke heralds him as one of the most notable polymaths in the history of Cambridge. As a researcher and writer, Chadwick pioneered the utilization of interdisciplinary research for the study of the cultures of early Northern Europe and beyond. At Cambridge, Chadwick is notable for having significantly contributed to the development of what would become the Department of Anglo- Saxon, Norse and Celtic, and supervised the education of generations of scholars, a large number of whom would themselves make major contributions to scholarship.

The original five-level reinforced concrete building was designed by architects, Stephenson and Meldrum (later Stephenson and Turner), in a Functionalist Modern style with its bold horizontal balconies, contrasting vertical service tower and minimal decoration. The white rendered exterior was trimmed with blue tiles and horizontal tubular steel balustrades. Between 1956-58 the hospital was substantially extended by architects, Meldrum and Noad, to a design sympathetic to the original by continuing the sweeping balconies. Further wings to the east were added in 1968 and again in 1977 with the front entrance altered. The hospital is of historical and architectural significance to the State of Victoria.

A Justice of Appeal is required by the Constitution to be a qualified barrister or solicitor with a minimum of seven years' experience in Fiji or another country prescribed by law, or a past or present senior judicial officer in Fiji or another country prescribed by Parliament. The judiciary is the only branch of government from which non-citizens are not excluded.

Accordingly, judges from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, among other countries, have sometimes served on Fiji's courts, including as Justices of Appeal. Justices of Appeal are required to retire on reaching the age of 70. The retirement age may be waived, however, for a term of not more than three years or for the duration of one or more sessions of the court concerned, to allow that person to continue in office, or to transfer to another judicial office, for a term of not more than three years. The waiver may be repeated, but not after the judge has reached the age of 75. No person, therefore, may serve as a Justice of Appeal after the age of 78. Compulsory retirement does not prohibit retired judges from acting in that capacity on a temporary basis.

The song was written by Freddie Mercury about the band's fall-out with their original manager and Trident Studios owner Norman Sheffield. Though the song makes no direct reference to him, Sheffield sued both the band and the record label for defamation. This resulted in an out-of-court settlement, thus revealing to the public his connection with the song. Mercury said that his lawyer had cautioned him against discussing the lyrics, but that it was written from a ‚Äúvery emotional‚Äù place for which he felt music was the best outlet. Roger Taylor also noted that despite the success of \\"Killer Queen\\" and Sheer Heart Attack, the album preceding A Night at the Opera, the band was broke before the album was made. Sheffield denied that he or his companies had mistreated the band in his capacity as manager, and cited the original 1972 management contracts between himself and Queen in his autobiography published in 2013, Life on Two Legs: Set The Record Straight, in his defence. The song was recorded and mixed at Sarm East Studios in late 1975. As with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", most of the guitar parts on the song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to Brian May how they needed to be played on guitar.  Composition  The song, which is in 4/4 meter, is dominated by guitars, strong lead and backing vocals as well as piano. It has a piano arpeggio intro with heavy guitars, bowed double bass, mechanical sounding noise and a loud shriek by Roger Taylor, which abruptly leads into the song in B minor. There are numerous subsections and layers, as was typical for Queen at the time. The verses have short sections with the tempo virtually halved, and the choruses are emphasised with strong harmonies and drum fills. Drum! magazine said of Taylor's drum work: \\"[...] Shortly after the 2/4 measure there‚Äôs an unusual snare accent on the & of 4 and a change to a half-time groove. These back-and-forth feel changes continue throughout the song and Taylor somehow makes them flow smoothly.\\" Lyrics Freddie Mercury later recalled that he had tried to make the lyrics as \\"coarse as possible\\", and that the other band members were initially shocked at the harsh lyrics.Mercury Rising: The Queen Interview John Ingham.

The rural‚Äìurban fringe, also known as the outskirts, rurban, peri-urban or the urban hinterland, can be described as the \\"landscape interface between town and country\\",http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 or also as the transition zone where urban and rural uses mix and often clash. Alternatively, it can be viewed as a landscape type in its own right, one forged from an interaction of urban and rural land uses.  Definition  Its definition shifts depending on the global location, but typically in Europe, where urban areas are intensively managed to prevent urban sprawl and protect agricultural land, the urban fringe will be characterized by certain land uses which have either purposely moved away from the urban area, or require much larger tracts of land. As examples: * Roads, especially motorways and bypasses * Waste transfer stations, recycling facilities and landfill sites * Park and ride sites * Airports * Large hospitals * Power, water and sewerage facilities * Factories * Large out-of-town shopping facilities, e.g. large supermarkets Despite these 'urban' uses, the fringe remains largely open, with the majority of the land agricultural, woodland, or other rural use. However, the quality of the countryside around urban areas tends to be low, with severance between the area of open land and bad maintained woodlands and hedgerows. In recent years there has been a growing interest in how the full environmental and social potential of the urban fringe can be unlocked. In England in 2005, the Countryside Agency (now part of Natural England) together with Groundwork, a community, and environmental regeneration body, produced a vision for the 'countryside in and around towns' that sets out ten 'functions' for a multi- functional urban fringe.http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/105001 Green Infrastructure and the Urban Fringe: Learning lessons from the Countryside in and Around Towns Programme (Countryside Agency and Groundwork UK, 2005) The realization of this vision would provide a high-quality environment right on the urban doorstep and provide the adjacent town or city with a host of 'ecosystem services'. It is estimated that within England the urban fringe covers as much as 20% of the land area. Such an extensive resource must be managed and used more intelligently and sustainably if the country as a whole is to develop and function sustainably. In the United States urban areas are defined as contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile, though in some areas the density may be as low as 500 per square mile. Urban areas also include the outlying territory of less density if it was connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 2.5 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but separated by water or other undevelopable territories. Another territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area.

The first three FedLabs were in Advanced Displays, Advanced Sensors, and Telecommunications. Each FedLab was a large consortium, with both an overall industrial leader and an ARL leader. The cooperative agreements forming the FedLabs were somewhat unusual in that the ARL was not a mere funder of research, but an active consortium participant.Brown, Edward (1998).

Virtual Organizations: Systems and Practices. Springer  Communities  Since 1999 the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and Society of Collaborative Networks (SOCOLNET) sponsored an annual conference called the Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises (PRO-VE). Over the last couple of decades, we have seen a major shift from an industrial economy to that of an information economy. This led to new technology to help capitalise on the information economy. Virtual enterprises allow businesses to specialize and be flexible within their environments. This business model had been applied to outsourcing and supply chains, as well as temporary consortia. Because the formation of virtual enterprises is an intricate process, a new form of technological support has been developed. The most ambitious of the support systems actually intends to automate part of the creation process, as well as the operation of these enterprises.Cardoso, H.L & Oliveira, E. (2005). Virtual Enterprise Normative Framework within Electronic Institutions.

(2008).L.M. Camarinha-Matos, H. Afsarmanesh, M. Ollus, Editors (2008). Methods and tools for Collaborative Networked Organizations. Springer As with all types of enterprises, virtual enterprises present both benefits and challenges. Benefits include more economical connections with suppliers, greater opportunities to create revenue, more efficient operations, and a reduction in administrative costs. Challenges facing virtual enterprises are: inexperienced users, security, expense control, and the level of incorporation required to create a successful virtual enterprise. Examples of virtual enterprises on the Internet included Virtual Music Enterprises (from about 2004 through 2010) and Virtual Enterprise California which is part of the Virtual Enterprises, International educational group. CNO life cycle Because a virtual enterprise is considered a collaborative networked organization (CNO), its organizational life cycle is different in terms of time spend on creation (entrepreneurial stage) and dissolution (decline). The CNO life cycle includes the stages: * Creation (initiation and foundation): During the initiation a strategic plan is made for the operational stage and the foundation of the CNO is executed by the constitution and actual start up. * Operation: Execution of operations within the defined scope of the strategic plan. * Evolution: The context of virtual organizations is rapidly changing and therefore in continuous evolution of its operation within the current strategic plan this means minor alterations. * Metamorphosis or Dissolution: Because CNOs have gained significant experience during their relatively short lives (compared to brick-and-mortar organizations) they keep the knowledge by metamorphosing into a new organization (changing its form) with a new purpose.

Biography Zylberberg was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. With the National team, he made his debut in 1997 and competed for his native country at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2004 Summer Olympics. After a short spell at Dutch club Hurley, he played at Atl√©tico San Sebasti√°n, in Spain. Special participation on tv In May 2012, a television advertisement emerged by made by Young & Rubicam, an American advertisement agency owned by the British agency WPP plc and made on behalf of the Argentine Presidency, entitled Olympic Games 2012: Homage to the Fallen and the Veterans of the Malvinas, featured Zylberberg training in the Falkland Islands.[Report by Peru News] The video features Zylberberg outside the Globe Tavern, doing dips on benches, then running past a British red telephone box. He then carries out step-ups on the islands' Great War Memorial honouring British sailors who died battling the German fleet in 1914, and finally ends with the quote \\"'\\" (\\"To compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil.\\"). Zylberberg entered the Falkland Islands on the pretext that he would be taking part in a marathon on the island. Zylberberg stated that his feature in the video conveys his country's feelings over the islands, stating \\"The message is that to every Argentine the islands belong to Argentina. To me to be training in any other province or to do it over the islands is the same,\\". The clip was first aired on May 2, the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano, involving the death of 323 troops, nearly half of Argentina's total 649 losses during the Falklands conflict.BBC News The advert drew protest from the Falkland Islands government, the British Government and within Argentina, both for the film's political aspects, and also that Zylberberg climbed over a British World War I war memorial. On 4 May 2012, the advertising agency responsible issued a public apology. The International Olympic Committee criticised Argentina, stating that the Olympic games should not be used as a forum to raise political issues. The president of the Argentine Olympic Committee, Gerardo Werthein issued a statement: \\"Using the Olympic Games to make political gestures of any kind is not acceptable and we will conduct ourselves in the proper spirit of Olympism in all that we do in London and elsewhere\\". It was revealed on May 9 that Zylberberg was to be dropped from the final Olympic warm-up event before the Olympic games and as a result, miss the games altogether. His absence from the squad was attributed by his coach, Pablo Rossi, to \\"sporting reasons,\\" and that Zylberberg \\"had not been able to complete all the necessary steps in pre-season\\". However there is speculation that Zylberberg was dropped to avoid adverse attention to the team and potential media frenzy when players land in London in July 2012. As a result of his involvement with the advertisement, Zylberberg was also the subject of online threats.

Electric heating is a process in which electrical energy is converted to heat energy. Common applications include space heating, cooking, water heating and industrial processes. An electric heater is an electrical device that converts an electric current into heat. The heating element inside every electric heater is an electrical resistor, and works on the principle of Joule heating: an electric current passing through a resistor will convert that electrical energy into heat energy. Most modern electric heating devices use nichrome wire as the active element; the heating element, depicted on the right, uses nichrome wire supported by ceramic insulators. Alternatively, a heat pump uses an electric motor to drive a refrigeration cycle, that draws heat energy from a source such as the ground or outside air and directs that heat into the space to be warmed. Some systems can be reversed so that the interior space is cooled and the warm air is discharged outside or into the ground. Space heating Space heating is used to warm the interiors of buildings. Space heaters are useful in places where air-handling is difficult, such as in laboratories. Several methods of electric space heating are used. =Infrared radiant heaters= space heater Electric infrared radiant heating uses heating elements that reach a high temperature. The element is usually packaged inside a glass envelope resembling a light bulb and with a reflector to direct the energy output away from the body of the heater. The element emits infrared radiation that travels through air or space until it hits an absorbing surface, where it is partially converted to heat and partially reflected. This heat directly warms people and objects in the room, rather than warming the air. This style of heater is particularly useful in areas through which unheated air flows. They are also ideal for basements and garages where spot heating is desired. More generally, they are an excellent choice for task-specific heating. Radiant heaters operate silently and present the greatest potential danger of ignition of nearby furnishings due to the focused intensity of their output and lack of overheat protection. In the United Kingdom, these appliances are sometimes called electric fires, because they were originally used to replace open fires. The active medium of the heater depicted in this section is a coil of nichrome resistance wire inside a fused silica tube, open to the atmosphere at the ends, although models exist where the fused silica is sealed at the ends and the resistance alloy is not nichrome. =Convection heaters= In a convection heater, the heating element heats the air in contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil or thermal fluid. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters. =Fan heaters= A fan heater, also called a forced convection heater, is a kind of convection heater that includes an electric fan to speed up the airflow. They operate with considerable noise caused by the fan. They have a moderate risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings. Their advantage is that they are more compact than heaters that use natural convection and are also cost-efficient for portable and small room heating systems. =Storage heating= A storage heating system takes advantage of cheaper electricity prices, sold during low demand periods such as overnight. In the United Kingdom, this is branded as Economy 7. The storage heater stores heat in clay bricks, then releases it during the day when required. Newer storage heaters are able to be used with various tariffs. Whilst they can still be used with economy 7, they can be used with day-time tariffs. This is due to the modern design features that are added during manufacturing. Alongside new designs the use of a thermostat or sensor has improved the efficiency of the storage heater. A thermostat or sensor is able to read the temperature of the room, and change the output of the heater accordingly. Water can also be used as a heat-storage medium. =Domestic electrical underfloor heating= An electric underfloor heating system has heating cables embedded in the floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating a thin layer of air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to belief people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds. Comfort is reached at lower air temperature due to eliminating circulating air. Radiant heating experiences highest comfort levels as people's own energy (¬± 70 Watt for an adult) (must radiate out in heating season) is in balance with its surrounds. Compared to convection heating system based on academic research the air temperatures may be lowered by up to 3 degrees. One variation is using tubes filled with circulating hot water as heat source for warming the floor. The heating principle remains the same. Both old style electric and warm water (hydronic) underfloor heating systems embedded in the floor construction are slow and cannot respond to external weather changes or internal demand/lifestyle requirements. The latest variant places specialized electric heating systems and blankets directly under the floor-decor and on top of additional insulation all placed on top of construction floors. Construction floors stay cold. The principle change of heat source positioning allows it to respond within minutes to changing weather and internal demand requirements such as life style being in/out, at work, rest, sleep, more people present/cooking, etc. =Lighting system= In large office towers, the lighting system is integrated along with the heating and ventilation system. Waste heat from fluorescent lamps is captured in the return air of the heating system; in large buildings a substantial part of the annual heating energy is supplied by the lighting system. However, this waste heat becomes a liability when using air conditioning. Such expenses can be avoided by integrating an energy efficient lighting system that also creates an electric heat source. =Heat pumps= A heat pump uses an electrically driven compressor to operate a refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from outdoor air, the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the evaporator section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the outdoor air or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a condenser coil within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by the air in the building (and sometimes also used for domestic hot water) causing the hot working fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the high pressure fluid is passed back to the evaporator section where it expands through an orifice and into the evaporator section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air. Heat pumps may obtain low-grade heat from the outdoor air in mild climates. In areas with average winter temperatures well below freezing, ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air-source heat pumps because they can extract residual solar heat stored in the ground at warmer temperatures than is available from cold air. According to the US EPA, geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air source heat pumps and up to 72% compared with electric resistance heating. The high purchase price of a heat pump vs resistance heaters may be offset when air conditioning is also needed. Liquid heating =Immersion heater= Small domestic immersion heater, 500 W An immersion heater has an electrical resistance heating element encased in a tube and directly placed in the water (or other fluid) to be heated. Portable immersion heaters may not have a control thermostat, since they are intended to be used only briefly and under control of an operator. For domestic hot water supply, or industrial process hot water, permanently installed heating elements in an insulated hot water tank may be used, controlled by a thermostat to regulate temperature. Household units may be rated only a few kilowatts. Industrial water heaters may reach 2000 kilowatts. Where off-peak electric power rates are available, hot water may be stored to use when required. Electric shower and tankless heaters also use an immersion heater (shielded or naked) that is turned on with the flow of water. A group of separate heaters can be switched to offer different heating levels. Electric showers and tankless heaters usually use from 3 to 10.5 kilowatts. Minerals present in the water supply may precipitate out of solution and form a hard scale on the heating element surface, or may fall to the bottom of the tank and clog water flow. Maintenance of water heating equipment may require periodic removal of accumulated scale and sediment. Where water supplies are known to be highly mineralized, scale production can be reduced by using low-watt-density heating elements. =Circulation heaters= Circulation heaters or \\"direct electric heat exchangers\\" (DEHE) use heating elements inserted into a \\"shell side\\" medium directly to provide the heating effect. All of the heat generated by the electric circulation heater is transferred into the medium, thus an electric heater is 100 percent efficient. Direct electric heat exchangers or \\"circulation heaters\\" are used to heat liquids and gases in industrial processes. =Electrode heater= With an electrode heater, there is no wire- wound resistance and the liquid itself acts as the resistance. This has potential hazards, so the regulations governing electrode heaters are strict. Environmental and efficiency aspects The efficiency of any system depends on the definition of the boundaries of the system. For an electrical energy customer the efficiency of electric space heating is 100% because all purchased energy is converted to heat. However, if a power plant supplying electricity is included, the overall efficiency drops drastically. For example, a fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Even though the electric heater is 100% efficient, the amount of fuel needed to produce the heat is more than if the fuel were burned in a furnace or boiler at the building being heated. If the same fuel could be used for space heating by a consumer, it would be more efficient overall to burn the fuel at the end user's building. On the other hand, replacing electric heating with fossil fuel burning heaters, isn't necessary good as it removes the ability to have renewable electric heating, this can be achieved by sourcing the electricity from a renewable source. Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about efficiency and the environment. In 2015 France generated only 6% of its electricity from fossil fuels, while Australia sourced over 86% of its electricity from fossil fuels.Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2020) - \\"Fossil Fuels\\". Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: 'https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels'; retrieved 2020-05-23 The cleanliness and efficiency of electricity are dependent on the source. In Sweden the use of direct electric heating has been restricted since the 1980s for this reason, and there are plans to phase it out entirely ‚Äì see Oil phase- out in Sweden ‚Äì while Denmark has banned the installation of direct electric space heating in new buildings for similar reasons.The Green Electricity Illusion, AECB, published 2005-11-11, accessed 26 May 2007 In the case of new buildings, low-energy building techniques can be used which can virtually eliminate the need for heating, such as those built to the Passivhaus standard. In Quebec, however, electric heating is still the most popular form of home heating. According to a 2003 Statistics Canada survey, 68% of households in the province use electricity for space heating. More than 90% of all power consumed in Quebec is generated by hydroelectric dams, which have low greenhouse gases emissions compared to fossil-fuel power stations. Low and stable rates are charged by Hydro-Qu√©bec, the provincially owned utility.Snider, Bradley. Home heating and the environment, in Canadian Social Trends, Spring 2006, pp. 15‚Äì19. Ottawa: Statistics Canada. To provide heat more efficiently, an electrically driven heat pump can raise the indoor temperature by extracting energy from the ground, the outside air, or waste streams such as exhaust air. This can cut the electricity consumption to as little as 35% of that used by resistive heating. Where the primary source of electrical energy is hydroelectric, nuclear, or wind, transferring electricity via the grid can be convenient, since the resource may be too distant for direct heating applications (with the notable exception of solar thermal energy). The electrification of heat of space and water heating is increasingly proposed as a way forward to decarbonise the current energy system, particularly with heat pumps. In case of large-scale electrification, impacts on the electricity grid due to potential increase in peak electricity demand and exposure to extreme weather events needs to be considered. Economic aspects The operation of electric resistance heaters to heat an area for long periods is costly in many regions. However, intermittent or partial day use can be more cost efficient than whole building heating due to superior zonal control. For example: A lunch room in an office setting has limited hours of operation. During low-use periods a \\"monitor\\" level of heat () is provided by the central heating system. Peak use times between the hours of 11:00 and 14:00 are heated to \\"comfort levels\\" (). Significant savings can be realized in overall energy consumption, since infrared radiation losses through thermal radiation are not as large with a smaller temperature gradient both between this space and unheated outside air, as well as between the refrigerator and the (now cooler) lunch room. Economically, electric heat can be compared to other sources of home heating by multiplying the local cost per kilowatt hour for electricity by the number of kilowatts the heater uses. E.g.: 1500-watt heater at 12 cents per kilowatt hour 1.5√ó12=18 cents per hour. When comparing to burning fuel it may be useful to convert kilowatt hours to BTUs: 1.5 kWh √ó 3412.142=5118 BTU. Industrial electric heating Electric heating is widely used in industry.Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, , pages 21-144 to 21-188 Advantages of electric heating methods over other forms include precision control of temperature and distribution of heat energy, combustion not used to develop heat, and the ability to attain temperatures not readily achievable with chemical combustion. Electric heat can be accurately applied at the precise point needed in a process, at high concentration of power per unit area or volume. Electric heating devices can be built in any required size and can be located anywhere within a plant. Electric heating processes are generally clean, quiet, and do not emit much byproduct heat to the surroundings. Electrical heating equipment has a high speed of response, lending it to rapid-cycling mass-production equipment. The limitations and disadvantages of electric heating in industry include the higher cost of electrical energy compared to direct use of fuel, and the capital cost of both the electric heating apparatus itself and the infrastructure required to deliver large quantities of electrical energy to the point of use. This may be somewhat offset by in-plant (on-site) efficiency gains in using less energy overall to achieve the same result. Design of an industrial heating system starts with assessment of the temperature required, the amount of heat required, and the feasible modes of transferring heat energy. In addition to conduction, convection and radiation, electrical heating methods can use electric and magnetic fields to heat material. Methods of electric heating include resistance heating, electric arc heating, induction heating, and dielectric heating. In some processes (for example, arc welding), electric current is directly applied to the workpiece. In other processes, heat is produced within the workpiece by induction or dielectric losses. As well, heat can be produced then transferred to the work by conduction, convection or radiation. Industrial heating processes can be broadly categorized as low-temperature (to about ), medium-temperature (between ), and high-temperature (beyond ). Low-temperature processes include baking and drying, curing finishes, soldering, molding and shaping plastics. Medium temperature processes include melting plastics and some non-metals for casting or reshaping, as well as annealing, stress-relieving and heat-treating metals. High-temperature processes include steelmaking, brazing, welding, casting metals, cutting, smelting and the preparation of some chemicals.

It has a bright yellow patch on the back of its neck/upper shoulders that gives the species its name. In aviculture, it is one of a number of smaller macaws often called \\"mini-macaws\\". Taxonomy The yellow-collared macaw was described by American ornithologist John Cassin in 1853. In fact, some literature refers to it as Cassin's macaw or the Yellow-naped macaw. Its specific epithet auricollis meaning gold-collared, from the Latin aurum 'gold', and collum 'neck'. In recent years it has often been placed in the genus Propyrrhura, but this is incorrect as per ICZN rules. Earlier, it had also been placed in the genus Ara. Description Two at Pana'ewa Rainforest Zoo, Hawaii, USA At Kakegawa Kacho-en, Japan It has a total length of about , of which almost half is tail feathers. The general plumage is green, with a distinct yellow collar that is broadest on the back of the neck. The yellow collar develops as the bird ages, with more vibrant colors found in mature birds. The front and crown is brownish black. The remiges and primary coverts are blue and the long, pointed tail has a red base, a narrow green center and a blue tip. The underside of the tail and flight feathers are greenish-yellow, similar to that of several other small macaws such as the blue-winged and red-bellied macaw. The legs are a dull pinkish color, and the iris is reddish to dull yellow. It has extensive bare white facial skin and the heavy bill is black, often tipped pale grey. Distribution and habitat  The main population occurs in the Pantanal of Brazil (south-western Mato Grosso, western Mato Grosso do Sul and southern Rond√¥nia), northern Argentina (eastern Jujuy and northern Salta), far northern Paraguay (Alto Paraguay and Concepci√≥n) and most of northern and eastern Bolivia (Beni, Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija). A second disjunct population occurs in far north-eastern Mato Grosso, south-eastern Par√° and western Tocantins in Brazil. It occurs in forest (but avoids the Amazon Rainforest), woodland, savanna and grassland with scattered trees. It mainly occurs in lowlands, but locally up to an altitude of . =Conservation status= It is generally fairly common and therefore considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International. The species is listed in CITES Appendix II, which means that commercial trade is allowed with an export permit (plus an import permit if required by laws of the importer's country). =Behavior= Typically seen in pairs or, during non-breeding season, small flocks. =Domestic pet behavior= As a domestic pet, a yellow collared is extremely social and demands attention. It requires about three to four hours per day of interaction. When properly cared for they can live up to fifty years. =Temperament= Affectionate, and somewhat mischievous, the yellow- collared macaw has a reputation for being an intelligent and resourceful little parrot. They thrive on attention from their owners, and like other macaws, will seek that attention by any means necessary. They also require a large cage with many toys because they get bored easily. They can have a fairly extensive vocabulary. They can be very affectionate but unpredictable with children. This bird has been known to get aggressive without attention. =Feeding= Feeds on fruits, flower buds and seeds. =Breeding= The yellow-collared macaw nest in a hole in a tree. The eggs are white and there are usually two or three in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 26 days, and the chicks fledge from the nest about 70 days after hatching.

Her mother's name was Maria Valenzuela and she was originally from a small village called San Javier located in Sinaloa, Mexico. She is one of the best known members of the Chicano street art movement. Early life  Elsa Flores demonstrated interest in arts from a very young age. She grew up on Los Angeles' east side, where Chicanos comprise a large percentage of the state's population. While a high school student, Flores received a scholarship to attend the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts. She then studied photography at California State University Los Angeles and afterwards enrolled at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, where she focused on her drafting skills. While at the Art Center, she taught art and music education at Plaza de la Raza with artist Carlos Almaraz and Louie P√©rez and David Hidalgo of Los Lobos. Flores occasionally performed in Los Lobos, as well as in the punk band The Knuckleheads formed with P√©rez and Hildago. The latter band mixed electronic instruments with the accordion, violin and flute. Career as an artist Flores began to gain recognition for her paintings, which have been exhibited around the world, during the 1970s. She met Carlos Almaraz in 1974, a fellow Chicano who was part of the early Chicano street art movement. Almaraz was a member of the famed Los Four artist collective. Elsa Flores and Carlos Almaraz eventually married in 1981, and the two collaborated on one of the most famed Chicano murals, the California Dreamscape. While Almaraz was already an icon among Chicanos because of his murals across California (as part of Los Four and as a solo artist), \\"California Dreamscape\\" helped Flores become an icon herself among Chicano artists. The 15' x 70' California Dreamscape mural was commissioned by the California Arts Council and is exhibited at the Reagan State Building on 3rd and Spring Street in downtown Los Angeles. In the celebratory year leading up to the Los Angeles bicentennial, Flores, P√©rez and other artists collaborated to complicate the celebrations. Together with P√©rez, Flores produced a multimedia event at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, which took place on September 5, 1980. Electric guitar, recordings played on tape recorders, and participants yelling at the audience were features of the event. In a related action, she photographed P√©rez as \\"Screwy Louie\\" carrying a cross through the Second Street Tunnel. Carlos Almaraz was diagnosed with AIDS during the 1980s, eventually leading to his death. After his death, Flores' fame continued to grow. Her paintings have been shown, to critical acclaim, in museums and art houses in places such as Hawaii, New York City and Mexico. She has had solo exhibitions in New Mexico and in Los Angeles. Many of her other exhibitions have been group exhibitions where her paintings have been showcased alongside those of other famous artists.

It was built between 1846 and 1864, and was designed by Napoleon LeBrun, from original plans by the Reverend Mariano Muller and the Reverend John B. Tornatore, with the dome and Palladian facade, designed by John Notman, added after 1850., p.52 The interior was largely decorated by Constantino Brumidi. The cathedral is the largest Catholic church in Pennsylvania, and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The cathedral has been the site of two papal Masses, one celebrated by Pope John Paul II in 1979, and the other by Pope Francis in 2015. The current rector of the cathedral is the Reverend Gerald Dennis Gill and the current Archbishop of Philadelphia is Nelson J. Perez. History On the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, June 29, 1846, Bishop Kenrick, then Bishop of Philadelphia, issued a pastoral letter announcing his determination to build a cathedral. Before Saint Peter and Paul was built, Philadelphia had two previous cathedrals; the first Catholic church in Philadelphia was Saint Joseph's, which was built in 1733. As the Catholic Church grew, a new church called Saint Mary's was built in 1763, which eventually was granted to be Philadelphia's first cathedral in 1810. As the Catholic Church continued to grew, Saint John's was eventually made the new cathedral in 1838 when a larger church was needed, and it was Saint John's that remained the cathedral until Bishop Kenrick began work on the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. It was the bishop's intention to avoid running into debt, so the cathedral was long in building. He chose for the site a plot of ground adjoining the seminary at Eighteenth and Race Streets. Construction on the cathedral began shortly thereafter but was not completed until 1864. This was less than 2 years after the Philadelphia Nativist Riots, which represented the height of Anti-Catholicism and Know- Nothingism in Philadelphia and, according to local lore, greatly influenced the design of the building. The cathedral was built with only very high clerestory windows that according to parish histories would inhibit vandalism. In order to protect the windows of the Cathedral Basilica from possible future riots, the builders would throw stones into the air to determine the height of where the windows would be placed.  Building  Chancel 1903, prior to addition of the apse. Basilica interior Basilica dome With its grand fa√ßade, vaulted dome, ornate main altar, eight side chapels and main sanctuary that comfortably holds 2,000 worshippers, the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is the largest brownstone structure and one of the most architecturally notable structures in the city of Philadelphia. The cathedral, presented in a Roman-Corinthian style of architecture, is modeled after the Lombard Church of St. Charles (San Carlo al Corso) in Rome. Its Palladian fa√ßade and aqua oxidized-copper dome are in the Italian Renaissance manner, as is the spacious interior, which features an oversized apse of stained glass and red antique marble in proportions reminiscent of Roman churches. A baldachin (canopy) over the main altar and the three altars on each of the side aisles point up this Italian Renaissance flavor. In the bowels of the building is the compact \\"Crypt of the Bishops\\". = Architects and designers = The basilica was designed by Napoleon LeBrun based on plans drawn up by the Reverend Mariano Muller and the Reverend John B. Tornatore, and by John Notman who added the dome and facade. LeBrun supervised the project from 1846 to 1851, when Notman took over until 1857, after which the cathedral was completed under LeBrun's supervision., p.111 LeBrun was a native Philadelphian born to French-Catholic parents. He designed numerous churches throughout Philadelphia, including St. Patrick's Catholic Church, Twentieth Street (1841); the Seventh Presbyterian Church (1842); the Scot's Presbyterian Church (1843); the Catholic Church of St. Peter the Apostle (German), Fifth Street (1843); and the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Holy Nativity (1844), no longer standing. Other notable buildings he designed include the Philadelphia Academy of Music. Notman is most noted for his Philadelphia ecclesiastical architecture for the Protestant Episcopal Church, including St. Mark's Church, Locust Street (1850); St. Clement's Church, Twentieth Street (1857); and the Church of the Holy Trinity, Rittenhouse Square. He also designed the Athenaeum of Philadelphia and parts of the New Jersey State House. Constantino Brumidi painted the ceiling mural in the dome - The Assumption of the Virgin into Heaven (1868) - and the round portraits of St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke and St. John on its pendentives. Brumidi was a Greek/Italian-American painter, best known for his murals in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., especially the Apotheosis of George Washington in the dome of the rotunda. Architect Henry D. Dagit renovated the cathedral interior, 1914‚Äì15, adding the apse behind the High Altar. D'Ascenzo Studios executed the apse's stained glass windows and mosaic murals. The four bronze statues in niches on the building's main facade - Mary, Jesus, St. Peter and St. Paul - were added in 1915.Mary the Immaculate Conception by Joseph Sibbel, from SIRIS.

Having come to the attention of the label, they went on to release his single \\"Bring Forth the Guillotine\\". Bullet's dyslexic, hardcore delivery and the hook of a James Brown sample (\\"Superbad\\") were an instant success and the single was twice re-issued with remixes by Ben Chapman and Norman Cook.

During the Norwegian campaign of 1940, Hardy participated in the First Battle of Narvik where she sank one German destroyer. As the British ships were withdrawing, they were discovered by two other German destroyers that so badly damaged Hardy that she had to be run aground to stop her from sinking. The ship was lifted by a rising tide and eventually capsized. Description Hardy displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. Hardy carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship's complement was 175 officers and men.Whitley, p. 107 The ship mounted five 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Hardy had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were carried originally, but this was increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 Service Hardy was laid down by Cammell Laird and Company at Birkenhead on 30 May 1935, launched on 7 April 1936 and commissioned on 11 December 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost ¬£278,482.English, pp. 102‚Äì03 The ship was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. Hardy patrolled Spanish waters from 1937 through 1939 during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee. After the destroyer struck a mine off Almeria on 13 May 1937, Hardy stood by in case Hunter needed further assistance. Hardy was berthed in Palma, Majorca, on 23 May 1937 when that port was bombed by the Spanish Republican Air Force, but was not damaged. After the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939, she began a refit in Devonport Dockyard between 2 June and 29 July. The ship was in Malta when World War II began in September.English, p. 103 Captain Warburton-Lee In October Hardy (pennant no. H87) was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone, to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. The ship and her half-sisters , , and rendezvoused with the battlecruiser , the aircraft carrier , and the light cruiser on 17 December. They refuelled in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil before proceeding to the estuary of the River Plate in case the damaged German pocket battleship attempted to escape from Montevideo, Uruguay, where she had taken refuge after losing the Battle of the River Plate.Rohwer, p. 11 She was given a brief overhaul at Devonport between 25 January and 12 February 1940 and was then transferred to Greenock, Scotland for convoy escort duties. The ship rejoined the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet in Scapa Flow on 9 March and became its flagship. On 6 April Hardy and the rest of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla escorted the four destroyer minelayers of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla as they sailed to implement Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the shipment of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The mines were laid on the early morning of 8 April, before the Germans began their invasion, and the destroyers then joined the battlecruiser and her escorts.Haarr, p. 65, 87, 308, 337 The wreckage of Hardy photographed in July 1962 The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee to attack German shipping in Narvik, Norway, on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half- sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy blew off the stern of the German flagship, , and killed the German flotilla commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another torpedo hit a merchant ship in the stern. A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After regrouping, Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to poor visibility.Haarr, pp. 336‚Äì43 As the British destroyers completed their second attack, they were engaged by three more German destroyers. The British destroyers attempted to withdraw to the west, but were pursued by the German ships. Two additional German destroyers crossed the T of the British ships and quickly knocked out Hardys forward guns. More hits to the ship's bridge and superstructure set her on fire, mortally wounded Captain Warburton-Lee and killed or wounded all of the other officers on the bridge except Paymaster Lieutenant G.H. Stanning, the Captain's Secretary. Although badly wounded, he took command and after several more hits disabled her boilers ordered her run aground at Vidrek. The First Lieutenant, who had not been present on the bridge, assumed command and ordered the ship abandoned. Some of the crew delayed doing so until the last torpedo was fruitlessly fired at a German ship and No. 4 gun fired until it was out of ammunition.Haarr, p. 345 Thirty-two of the casualties of the sinking of HMS Hardy, all unidentified, are interred at the Commonwealth War Graves section of H√•kvik cemetery in Narvik, alongside two identified casualties from Captain Warburton-Lee was brought ashore but died after an hour from his head wounds. 139 other men managed to get ashore, although 26 were seriously wounded. Captain Warburton-Lee was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Hardy was lifted off the beach at high tide and drifted to the head of Skjomen fjord where she capsized in shallow waters.Haarr, p. 346 The wreck was still visible as late as 1963.English, p. 104 See also * List of shipwrecks in 1940 Notes References  External links * IWM Interview with survivor Cyril Cope * IWM Interview with survivor Stanley Robinson * IWM Interview with survivor William Pulford * IWM Interview with survivor Leslie Smale G and H-class destroyers of the Royal Navy Ships built in Merseyside 1936 ships World War II destroyers of the United Kingdom World War II shipwrecks in the Norwegian Sea Maritime incidents in April 1940 ","title":"HMS Hardy (1936)"},{"id":"3508376","text":"Staines Town Football Club is a professional football club based in Staines- upon-Thames, Middlesex. Founded in 1892, they currently play in the . The club is parented to the Middlesex County Football Association. Staines Town's most notable rivals include Ashford Town, Egham Town and Hampton & Richmond Borough. History =Early days= Staines Town FC was founded in 1892 and was known under various names including Staines F.C.,Staines Albany F.C., 'Staines Lagonda F.C.', and 'Staines Town F.C.', until it folded in 1935. However, prior to World War II the club re-formed as Staines Vale. In 1953 Staines Town were founder members of the Hellenic League, where they finished runners-up in 1956. In 1958 they joined the Spartan League and won the title two years later. After finishing second in 1971, Staines Town advanced to the Athenian League, where they won the Second Division title at the first attempt, amassing a record number of points. =Isthmian League= The club were elected to the new Isthmian League Division One in 1973. In their second season, the club finished top and were promoted to the Premier Division. In a nine-year stay, the club's best finish was fourth. However, a ground grading ruling meant that the club were demoted in 1984. The club bounced back five years later only for its Premier Division status to be lost again in 1993 when the club were relegated for the first time in 63 years. Again the club were promoted in 1996 and again it was quickly lost, with the club returning to Division One after only a year. Having lobbied Spelthorne Council on and off for 20 years, planning permission for a ¬£6.5m conference and health facility was granted in April 2000 and finalised a year later. During construction, Staines groundshared with Walton & Hersham and Egham Town before the return to Wheatsheaf Lane on 22 February 2003. During 2002‚Äì03 and 2003‚Äì04, Staines played in Division One South of the Isthmian League and on the last day of season 2003‚Äì04, under Steve Cordery, they secured a place in the Premier Division in the newly re-structured pyramid. The Swans spent five seasons in this division before winning promotion to the Conference South in 2009. They had finished second in the league and therefore gained promotion through the play-offs, beating Carshalton Athletic 1‚Äì0 in the final at Wheatsheaf Park on 2 May 2009. Louis Wells saved a Carshalton penalty in the 85th minute with Scott Taylor scoring the winning goal in extra time. Staines had also finished as runners up in the previous season, but had lost 2‚Äì1 to AFC Wimbledon in the playoff final after taking a first half lead but conceding two late goals in the last seven minutes. Dover Athletic in 2009 =Life in the Conference South= The 2009‚Äì10 campaign marked the Swans' first ever appearance in the Conference South and they began their journey brightly, defeating Weston- Super-Mare 0‚Äì1 and Dorchester Town 3‚Äì0. A home defeat, 1‚Äì2, to Havant & Waterlooville was then followed by five consecutive draws and then a 1‚Äì3 victory away at St. Albans City. Two significant victories in late October 2009 were beating first place, and at the time unbeaten, Newport County 1‚Äì0 at home followed four days later beating third place Thurrock 1‚Äì2 away. On Boxing Day 2009, Staines won 4‚Äì1 away to rivals Hampton and Richmond Borough, following this up by beating them 4‚Äì0 at the Wheatsheaf on New Years Day 2010, with Ali Chaaban scoring a hat-trick. Another significant victory was away at Chelmsford, winning 0‚Äì1 through a Marc Charles-Smith goal, Charles-Smith's third goal in a little over 48 hours having scored twice at Dorchester only two days previously. Steve Cordery was named the Conference South manager of the month for January, 2010. Despite a magnificent February and March when Staines Town were in the play-off places, they finished in a very creditable eighth place in their first season in the Conference South. =Cup history= The club have reached the FA Cup first round proper on six occasions, in 1879, 1880, 1984 (losing 2‚Äì0 at a Neil Warnock-managed Burton Albion), 2007, 2009 and 2015. In 2007 Staines were drawn away against League Two outfit Stockport County. A crowd of 3,460 saw Staines go behind to a Matty McNeil header but a 76th-minute equaliser from Charles-Smith earned a replay. It was announced on 12 November that the replay would be shown on Sky Sports, resulting in a ¬£75,000 windfall for each club. Staines Town completed the improbable upset as they won the match in penalty kicks (4‚Äì3, two magnificent saves by Swans goalkeeper Shaun Allaway, the winning penalty scored by Dave Sargent) after drawing 1‚Äì1 in extra time, after having taken the lead in the eighth minute with an Adrian Toppin goal. In the next round they faced Peterborough United at home, and were beaten 5‚Äì0. Sir Alex Ferguson (father of Peterborough manager Darren) and Sir Trevor Brooking were among the guests of Staines Town FC on the day. On 7 November 2009 they beat League Two Shrewsbury Town 0‚Äì1 at the Prostar Stadium, Shrewsbury in the 1st Round proper of the F.A. Cup to reach the second round of the competition. The Second Round draw saw Staines Town drawn at home to the winners of the following evening's First Round game of Millwall vs AFC Wimbledon, which Millwall won 4‚Äì1. On 28 November 2009 they earned a place in the 3rd Round Draw for the first time ever after a 1‚Äì1 draw against League One Millwall, Ali Chaaban scoring a 79th-minute penalty to level the score after having gone behind ten minutes earlier, in front of a 2,753 crowd. The replay at the New Den was on 9 December and was broadcast live on the FA.com website. A home tie against Championship side Derby County in the 3rd Round awaited the winners of the replay, which Millwall won 4‚Äì0. There have been two appearances in the last 32 of the FA Trophy, the first back in 1976, losing to Morecambe in a 2nd replay and then in a replay to Halifax Town in 2004 after drawing 1‚Äì1 at The Shay in the first match. Another significant match in the club's history was in 1975 when they beat Italian Amateur cup winners Banco di Roma 3‚Äì0 on aggregate (1-0 in Rome, 2-0 in Wheatsheaf Lane) for the Barassi Cup. Staines have also lifted the Middlesex Senior Cup on no fewer than ten occasions. In 1997 under Chris Wainwright, beating Yeading in a penalty shoot out, whilst the Middlesex Charity Cup was lifted in 1994 with a 4‚Äì0 win over Northwood. The latest victory in the Middlesex Senior Cup was in 2013 with a 2‚Äì0 win over Ashford Town (Middx). The Carlsberg Cup (an Isthmian League tournament now abolished) was lifted in 1995 against Boreham Wood where the Swans scored a last minute equaliser from the last ever experimental 'kick in' in English football. In the London Senior Cup, Staines were runners up in both 1977 and 1981, the earlier final went to a replay versus Wimbledon which 'The Dons' won in their last ever match as a non-League club. =Recent history= Staines were relegated from the Southern Football League Premier Division South in the 2018-19 season after a 7-0 defeat to Hartley Wintney.Relegation Records *Isthmian League Premier Division Play-Offs, 2008‚Äì09 *FA Cup best performance: Second Round Proper, 2007‚Äì08 and 2009‚Äì2010 *FA Trophy best performance: Fourth Round, 2003‚Äì04 Stadium Wheatsheaf Park is the home of the Staines Town Football Club Wheatsheaf Park, It is situated in Wheatsheaf Lane, Staines-upon-Thames, Middlesex, TW18 2PD. It has been the home of the club since it was purchased in 1951. Like many football stadia, it has changed greatly over time; the most recent of these changes was the development of the main stand in the Wheatsheaf Lane End. Planning permission for this was granted by Spelthorne Council in March 2000, and Staines Town returned to the revamped ground on 22 February 2003. The club now boasts a brand new sports bar with Sky Sports football each week and refurbished changing rooms. Wheatsheaf Park is one of the most developed stadiums in its league. Wheatsheaf Park has a total capacity of 3,009, with 300 seated and 800 in covered terrace. The record league attendance for a match at Wheatsheaf Park was 2,285 vs AFC Wimbledon in 2006. However, one year later Staines had an F.A Cup match against Stockport County and the attendance just crept over the 2,860 mark, setting the club's overall attendance record. Wheatsheaf Park is also the current home stadium of Chelsea Ladies Football Club. In 2015 the ground received its UEFA Stadium Category 1 approval and hosted Chelsea L.F.C home fixtures in the UEFA Women's Champions League.

This page is a list of all characters in the series. The Invisibles The Invisibles are an organization of a freedom fighters at war with the oppressive Outer Church. Many members are psychic or possess some kind of supernatural ability. =Main cast= Jack Frost Jack Frost is the alias of Dane McGowan, a rebellious teenager from Liverpool, England. Early in his childhood, Dane McGowan affects the cold, violently rebellious persona of \\"Jack Frost\\" in order to cope with his shattered home life. After trying to burn down his school, Dane is sent to Harmony House, a reeducation facility for young boys run by the Outer Church, the villains of the series. The Invisibles free Dane from Harmony House and arrange for him to be mentored by Tom O'Bedlam, an experienced Invisible. Under Tom O‚ÄôBedlam's guidance, Dane realizes that the \\"Jack Frost\\" persona is restricting his growth, a realization that allows a softer, more compassionate Dane to emerge. Dane is contacted by Barbelith, a mysterious sentient satellite featured in the series, during this time, though his memories of contact are repressed until he is ready to access them. After being injured on a mission, Dane abandons his teammates and wanders through London, eventually returning home to Liverpool. While on the run, his hidden memories are triggered and he learns that he is a messiah. At first he rejects this responsibility, but he soon finds that he cannot ignore the empathy he now feels for the rest of the world. Later on, he remembers that during his first contact with Barbelith he was forced to endure the collective suffering of humanity throughout time. This memory spurs him to return to the Invisibles so that he may set things right. While Dane rejects their violent methods and their dualistic perception of the world, which he finds just as flawed as that of the Outer Church, he stays with them because they are his friends. Over the course of their adventures together, he is revealed the truth behind time, the creation of the universe, and his place in it. When he is ready, Dane starts his own Invisibles cell and, in 2012, oversees the end of the physical world as foreseen. Dane is a powerful psychic and has many other undefined supernatural abilities. King Mob Once a horror writer named Gideon Starorzewski, King Mob is the leader of the cell of the Invisibles. He is the agent who recruited Jack Frost, and he's the lover of Ragged Robin. Ragged Robin Ragged Robin is the Invisibles' psychic operative, sent back from the future to bring the science of time travel to the Invisibles. She later becomes the group's leader when they (randomly) reassign their elemental roles. Born in 1988, she joined the Invisibles at the age of 20 in 2008, when Mason Lang found her in a mental asylum. In 2012, she returned to 1990 in a \\"timesuit\\", making her the first person to travel by time. She was then found by the Invisible John-a-Dreams, who brought her to the cell she had previously joined in the future. During the 1990s, when most of the story is set, she is still a member of the same cell. She becomes romantically involved with its new leader, King Mob, before replacing him as the leader. After explaining her futuristic past, she reveals the timesuit, still hidden from when she first returned. An Invisible scientist researching time (who would later build the timesuit and send her back in it) named Takashi repairs the timesuit and returns her to the year 2012, minutes after her departure. Her name and look are based on the Raggedy Ann doll. She has some mental difficulties related to her time traveling ‚Äì she introduces herself to Jack Frost by saying, \\"Hi, I'm Ragged Robin ‚Äì I'm nuts.\\" Boy \\"Boy\\" is Lucille Butler, an officer of the New York Police Department. Her brother Martin, also a police officer, was working for The Conspiracy, a fact known to a third brother, a gang member named \\"Eezy D\\", but not to Lucille. In a battle against the Outer Church, Eezy D is killed and Martin is taken prisoner. Lucille's life is saved by her partner, although he cautions her that the Invisibles will be looking for her. Hoping they will help her rescue her brother Martin, Lucille allows herself to be recruited by the Invisibles, who give her the code name \\"Boy\\". Boy becomes somewhat of a mentor to Jack Frost, and their relationship eventually develops into a romantic one. Boy later steals an artifact known as the \\"Hand of Glory\\" and goes searching for the secret prison camp in which she believes Martin to be detained. Boy is abducted by the Outer Church and informed that her identities as \\"Boy\\" and \\"Lucille Butler\\", among others, were entirely fabricated, and that she was secretly an operative sent to retrieve the Hand of Glory for the \\"Lost Ones\\", who plan to use its power to destroy the sun. However, Boy still refuses to kill King Mob. Following this, it is revealed that the ostensible agents of the Outer Church are in fact members of Invisibles Cell #23, who have been deprogramming Boy to defuse a previous hypnotic suggestion from the real Outer Church. When she realizes that there is no way to save Martin, and there never had been, Boy quits the Invisibles forever, and she starts a new life in New York, where she later has a child. Lord Fanny Lord Fanny is a trans woman sorceress who was recruited into the Invisibles by John-a-Dream. She is shown to be quite powerful, destroying Mr. Quimper and banishing the demon Orlando. Born male into a matrilineal family of bruhas, they were raised as a girl and put through a blood rite of passage as a child where they faced Mictlantecuhtli, the Aztec god of death and gained magical powers and the knowledge of their whole life. =Most frequent allies= In addition to the cell of five first led by King Mob, then Ragged Robin, there are other Invisibles (from other cells) who frequently work together with the main characters. *Jolly Roger ‚Äì A member of the all-lesbian cell of the Invisibles known as the \\"Poison Pussies\\". She discovers a hidden station in Dulce, New Mexico run by the United States government with the assistance of \\"ultraterrestrials\\" called \\"Lost Ones\\". The station contains the remains of her deceased lover, but also the secret vaccine for the AIDS virus. Mind controlled (to an extent) by Mr. Quimper, Roger convinces the Invisibles to storm the station. She later, when Quimper's control of her is broken by Ragged Robin, operates with King Mob's group like a steady member. Her other operations involve a (this time successful) assault on Dulce, and the crashing of the Moonchild ceremony. She is murdered by Miles Delacourt. *Jim Crow ‚Äì A houngan and musician, Jim Crow is first encountered by the Invisibles investigating a new variety of crack cocaine that turns its users into mindless undead. Crow later learns that the leaders of the pharmaceutical company behind the drug are using it to experience the brutal acts of the zombies vicariously. Crow kills them all with this assistance of a scorpion-shaped loa called \\"Baron Zaraguin\\". He later goes on to further missions with the Invisibles. Crow is one of the most morally ambiguous characters in the series, since he does what he feels is right ‚Äì but during operations he must always make a sacrifice to the Death God, and at one point risks killing off the entire American Southwest to satisfy the urges of Zaraguin. *Helga ‚Äì A Scandinavian linguist and computer code expert who creates a language program for the Invisibles to use against the Outer Church, and a \\"cut and paste\\" (partially photography-based) grimoire that is essential to take control over the Moonchild ritual. She appears to be somewhat of an overachiever in linguistics, having translated Winnie-the-Pooh to !Kung and experimenting with alien languages to great physical risk. She tortures Sir Miles through a combination of alien glossary and a serum that allows words to be perceived as immediate truth. Her destabilizing of and language-hypnotic control over Miles is instrumental in bringing him down. Her real name is Olga Tannen. *Mason Lang ‚Äì Billionaire sympathizer with (and financer of) the Invisibles' cause, Mason Lang received information in a dream (or alien abduction) about the possibilities of storing information on molecules of water, a science which becomes his life's work. He tricks the United States government into retaining his services to help them understand a prototype time machine. He also sells software and technology to the government, in which he installs back door access, which eventually puts the entire military- industrial complex under his control. In 2012, the proliferation of \\"smart drinks\\" makes it seem as if Lang eventually succeeded with his water molecule project. It is stated in the third volume that he died sometime before 2012, although it is never specifically revealed how. *Takashi Satoh ‚Äì A time- scientist who works for Mason Lang on his time machine group. Part of Ragged Robin's mission is to bring back some items in time that will trigger Satoh's inspiration for building the time machine ‚Äì making her mission a causal loop. He is seemingly killed in 2012, as the Archons breach the laboratory. *Elfayed ‚Äì A Middle-Eastern high master in the Invisible College. He takes charge of Jack Frost's training later in the series after Jack accepts his fate. The 1920s Cell *Queen Mab ‚Äì A psychic woman, Beryl Wyndham, from circa 1924 who is a leading figure in Edith Manning's cell. She is romantically involved with both Edith Manning and King Mob I. She is betrayed and murdered by Sir Miles in 1965. *King Mob I ‚Äì An anarchist revolutionary, Ronald Tolliver, from circa 1924 who is part of Edith Manning's entourage. King Mob (II) remarks that he is the only one in his cell who is not obviously English upper-class. He is killed during the Spanish Civil War in 1937. *Edith Manning ‚Äì A \\"flapper\\" of the Roaring Twenties who helps the Invisibles obtain an artifact called the \\"Hand of Glory\\". She also helps King Mob activate it by anointing it with their bodily fluids from a sex act. She remains an active member of the Invisibles until her natural death at the age of 99. Apparently her family have a tradition of Invisible activity, her uncle (Tom O' Bedlam's father) being a 'Grand Magus' in what appears to be an Occultist Invisibles cell. *Tom O'Bedlam ‚Äì In the 1920s a repressed, arrogant and rather snobbish boy who is drawn into the libertine Invisible cell of his cousin Edith Manning partially due to his crush on her, partially as a form of rebellion against his father's more conservative (in terms of ritual) brand of invisibilism. He goes mad during the Hand of Glory ritual, and is later in life seen as a semi-mad derelict. He helps Jack Frost realize his powers, for all purposes being his mentor. Tom commits suicide by leaping off a skyscraper, in order to awaken Jack. He hints that his mission of mentoring Jack was the only thing that kept him from seeking death. After Tom's death it is revealed that he became the most powerful magician of his species (fulfilling the stated goal of Edith's callous treatment), the inference being that other races exist, surpassing human psychic ability. *Billy Chang ‚Äì A Chinese mystic who is part of Edith Manning's entourage. He is an expert when it comes to relics, and understands a great deal about the Hand of Glory. He disappears without a trace following the Hand of Glory ritual. Division X Division X are a small band of police officers who investigate bizarre and inexplicable crimes and phenomena. Although out of commission when The Invisibles starts, they are brought back together at the end of volume one and soon find themselves on the trail of The Outer Church. Division X itself is based on the TV show Department S, and each of the officers resembles a famous TV detective character, as seen below. An explanation for this is given in volume 3. *Paddy Crowley (based on George Cowley from The Professionals) ‚Äì \\"the Right Honourable Sir Patrick Crowley\\" is an old Eton student and former acquaintance of Sir Miles. The two don't really get along anymore. Paddy Crowley participates in the 'brainwashing' of Sir Miles by Helga, but is killed by Orlando in the Moonchild ritual. *George Harper (based on George Carter from The Sweeney) ‚Äì unapologetically beer- drinking and porn-loving, somewhat of a 'slacker' at the first impression, but has psychic and weapons skills that aren't to be trifled with. *Jon Six (based on Jason King from Department S and Jason King, his name may also be based on that of Number Six, the protagonist of the television series The Prisoner) ‚Äì An Invisible known as \\"Mister Six\\" who was undercover as Jack Frost's history teacher when Frost was still \\"Dane McGowan\\". He is widely considered one of the more knowledgeable people in the world when it comes to magic and conspiracies, and appears to be driven by a fundamental need to always know more. While attempting to deprogram Jack Flint into realizing the entire Division X are Invisibles under cover, Six is shot by George Harper but survives. The Harlequinade invites him to \\"rejoin the ultimate conspiracy\\", after which he is seen to have an even stronger mastery of arcane arts. Together with Helga, he guides Jack Frost into the world of the Outer Church during the Moonchild ritual. *Jack Flint (based on Jack Regan from The Sweeney) ‚Äì An agent of \\"Division X\\". Flint is captured by Purves and his numerous identities are stripped away, leaving him into a state where he speaks in tongues and alien phonemes. During his deconstruction he realizes that he is, at some level, also John-A-Dreams. Emerging from the deconstruction, he claims that his body is merely a 'fiction suit' used to experience the Invisibles, and at the Moonchild ceremony he permits himself to be killed by the demon Orlando ‚Äì knowing that this is what is going to happen anyway. The 2000s Many characters from earlier in the series are obviously present in the part of the series set in the years between 1998 and 2012. Some very few characters are, however, era-specific. *Reynard. A future Invisible who claims that instead of a personality she has a \\"memeplex\\", allowing her to choose between identities. Dane McGowan recruits her at her school in Seattle, where he is underground posing as a school teacher‚Äîmuch like Mister Six in Liverpool twenty years earlier. Her initiation into the Invisibles consists partially of three years spent as an accountant. She breaks into Technocorp with Dane McGowan, and is present at the \\"ground zero\\" when the time machine is launched. Other allies These are other notable Invisibles or pro-Invisible actors that the series brings up from time to time. *Oscar ‚Äì A slightly overweight Invisible with poor manners who initially acts as Boy's patrol partner. He is involved in her deprogramming procedure, and active in a US-American Invisibles cell that uses sketchy methods (according to King Mob, at least). *Coyote ‚Äì An Invisible who is involved in Boy's deprogramming procedure. *Georgie Girl ‚Äì As above. *Shanjeet ‚Äì An Indian woman who travels with King Mob during the first few issues of volume III while he is in disguise. It is unclear whether they are romantically involved. *Papa Skat ‚Äì An Invisible from circa 1924. He first appears as an adversary to Edith, but it is later revealed that he was merely testing her. *Purves ‚Äì First seemingly an Outer Church agent, but it is revealed that he works with Mister Six to 'deprogram' Division X into realizing that they are the Invisibles they have been searching for all along. Following this he also works with Helga to 'brainwash' Sir Miles. *Christine Sherman *The Marquis de Sade ‚Äì An aristocrat, revolutionary and author of philosophy-laden, sadomasochistic novels from the 18th century, De Sade is brought forward in time by the Invisibles to create a \\"pocket utopia\\". He is depicted as being crippled, short, and morbidly overweight. He effectively creates a large Inivisible cell at a manor complex where people experiment with different kinds of sexual activity, often involving heavy doses of role play. Both physically and in terms of what he does, he is a mirror image of the Outer Church's Mr. Quimper. *Mary Shelley ‚Äì A Romantic poet, women's rights' activist and mother to Percy Shelley's children. She appears more grounded in reality than her somewhat fleeting mate. She is seen receiving an apple from, and discussing with, the Blind Chessplayer. *Percy Shelley ‚Äì A Romantic poet, atheist, radical, and vegetarian seen having a discussion with Lord Byron in Venice, Italy in 1819. Shelley explains that he intends for his writings to act as a map that will help guide the world to a day when all \\"men and women will be equal and free from tyranny, free of God and fear.\\" *Lord Byron ‚Äì A Romantic poet, atheist, radical, and \\"club-footed sodomite\\" seen having a discussion with Percy Shelley in Venice, Italy in 1819. Although a member of the Invisible College like Shelley, Byron is much more pessimistic about the likelihood of creating a utopian society, believing that \\"men are like sheep and will obey anyone who kicks their arses hard enough.\\" The Outer Church The Outer Church exists in the \\"unhealthy\\" universe, where conformity and hierarchy consume individuality and free will. The demon-like Archons of the Outer Church wish to enslave humanity and rob them of everything that cannot be measured, weighed and counted. The Outer Church's representatives on Earth are politicians, policemen, royalty and other representatives of control and order. They run the secret conspiracies that attempt to keep all of humanity docile and malleable. *King Archon/Abbadon/Rex Mundi ‚Äì The ruler of the Archons. It is the plan of Sir Miles and other human servitors of the Outer Church to bring him to our world through the coronation of the Moonchild ‚Äì after which he is to possess the body of the Moonchild and thereby take direct and total control over all life on Earth. Never shown, and perhaps actually non-existent. The attempted possession of Dane McGowan by the entity seems to have no effect at all ‚Äì although Dane claims he \\"ate it\\". *King-of-All-Tears ‚Äì This Archon is a vaguely humanoid figure standing over seven feet tall and wearing flowing dark-green robes. His face is reminiscent of a black, fanged and horned equine-like skull with a long vertebrae-like protuberance on the top of his head. Two curved white horns jut up from his shoulders. His fingers appear as either a cluster of tentacles or long talons. When preparing for battle, he emits a howl \\"summoning his weapons‚Äîhis cloak of inks, his neuroworm larvae and nanofactories.\\" It is shown that being unprotected in the same room as him for a longer period of time causes rampant, fast-breeding skin cancer. The King-of-All-Tears is the direct master of Ms. Dwyer, who summons him to the House of Fun during Miles Delacourt's interrogation of King Mob and Lord Fanny. He later tries to prevent Ragged Robin from traveling back in time from 2012. The King claims his name is due to the fact that he \\"weeps for the end of the era\\" and all that he (a King of this World) has built. He is banished at one time by Dane McGowan on threat of saying \\"his [real] name\\", and King Mob eventually destroys him utterly by dosing him with logoplasm (a substance that makes words seem real) and shooting him with a pop gun. *King-in-Chains ‚Äì A vaguely humanoid figure standing over seven feet tall and wearing a tattered dark-purple robe with chains trailing out from underneath it. His nobbed, featureless black head has a vertical slit down the center that emits a white light. He has long, slender, filth-covered talon-like fingers. He is the direct master of Mr. Gelt, headmaster of Harmony House, who is killed by King Mob during his rescue of Dane McGowan. *Two other Archons are also shown, but never named. *Sir Miles Delacourt ‚Äì A master of conspiracies, Miles Delacourt is a director of the Secret Intelligence Service, a high ranking Freemason, and the controlling force behind the plot to install Rex Mundi as Monarch of the United Kingdom. Delacourt, although of English nobility, seems to have been a beatnik at one point, but during a series of Project MKULTRA-like experiments with LSD his visions lead him to believe that at the end of history \\"the Machine\\" wins, and ultimately there are no other choices than being slave or master. He betrays his circle, writing a book titled The Invisibles which scandalizes Queen Mab, and later kills her as token of his willingness to serve the conspiracy. Although he develops into a cold-blooded human monster who hunts the homeless for sport, he still does not seem entirely capable of 'shaking off' the wrongness of his first murder. After the failure of the Outer Church's plot to use Jack Frost as a host for the King-Archon, Miles proposes to serve Helga (who has taken control over him to a certain degree) but is rejected. Mister Six hands him a rope, and he takes this to imply that his only responsibility left is to remove himself from the stage. He then commits suicide by jumping from the aisles in Westminster Abbey, after singing a verse of the Eton Boating Song. *Mister Quimper ‚Äì The owner of a strip club whose employees claim to have been coerced into performing in porn movies with aliens. Quimper is capable of lodging a part of himself in bad, repressed memories like a virus ‚Äì and use these memories to eventually delete the identity of the victim and take total control. He claims that when the bad memories 'burst', victims will ask him actively to take control in order to blank out the pain. He is psychically devastated by Ragged Robin, and has to be taken to the Outer Church by Colonel Friday to be restored. The Invisibles successfully execute a mission to get Ragged Robin close enough to Quimper to remove his Outer Church programming and find out who or what he really is: a spirit of some sort, given flesh and viciously abused at the hands of the same perpetrators who once gang-raped Lord Fanny. Quimper disappears after realizing what he once was. *Colonel Friday ‚Äì Chief of the hidden station at Dulce, New Mexico in which the vaccine for the AIDS virus is kept. Friday also wields the \\"Scorpio\\" machine, which can implant horrible fears in the human mind. He is a modified servant of the Archons, and claimed by the Blind Chessman to be one of the first that the Archons approached for modification, all the way back in 1945. He is murdered by the Outer Church after failing twice to protect Dulce from the Invisibles. *Orlando ‚Äì A demon assassin. He encounters Lord Fanny once in Mictlan and twice on Earth. The latter encounters both end in his banishment back to Mictlan. Orlando enjoys wearing the skin of the people he murders. He cuts a finger from Jack Frost, and kills Jack Flint. Like Quimper, the Chessman, Elfayed and Jack Flint, there is an aspect of John-A-Dreams in him (see: John-A-Dreams). *Ms. Dwyer ‚Äì A modified servant of the Archons, first introduced as an administrator at Harmony House. She later takes charge of Sir Miles' attempts to interrogate King Mob. Ms. Dwyer's body is host to a great deal of Archon technology, including 4D armor and nanites in her blood. She is sacrificed by Jim Crow as payment for his successful rescue operation of King Mob and Lord Fanny from the House of Fun. *Mr. Gelt ‚Äì A modified servant of the Archons, first introduced as an administrator at Harmony House. Killed by King Mob. *Brodie ‚Äì An assassin hired by Sir Miles to seduce Lord Fanny for the purpose of learning information about King Mob. He apparently is genuinely attracted to Lord Fanny, but work is work. Lord Fanny stabs him to death. *The Moonchild ‚Äì A grotesque, 200-year-old creature which is part Archon and part English Royalty, inspired by the myth of the Monster of Glamis. It is kept behind a magic mirror. The Moonchild is intended to be used as a host for Rex Mundi, the ruler of The Outer Church. How much the monster actually understands of everything is questionable ‚Äì it appears to be almost completely wittless, innocent like a wild animal. Sir Miles kills it, when it is revealed that according to the most secret of the Outer Church's plans, it was intended to symbolize the death of the old order, and that it is Dane McGowan who is supposed to be the host for the Rex Mundi. *Queen Elizabeth II ‚Äì What it says. She is present at the Abbey, and crowns the Moonchild. Allegiances Unclear There are several characters in The Invisibles who appear to take no side in the struggle between the Invisibles and the Outer Church ‚Äì sometimes helping one, sometimes the other. They reflect the message that the struggle is, at some level, a false construct ‚Äì something entirely else is going on behind the scenes. *Barbelith ‚Äì An artificial satellite hidden on the dark side of the moon. It functions as a psychic \\"placenta\\" for humanity, getting in touch with all humans who attain \\"higher consciousness\\" and gently guiding them through the transition. It is also stated that \\"we\\" created Barbelith to save us from ourselves. When in contact with Barbelith, some experience it as alien abduction, some anchor the experience in religious imagery ‚Äì it depends on the individual at hand. Upon being discovered by astronauts, Barbelith explodes ‚Äì at the moment of our universe's evolution to the next form. *The Blind Chessman ‚Äì The Blind Chessman appears in different disguises throughout the story, helping different sides in the battle. At one point, for example, he is seen to be the superior of Colonel Friday, yet his actual function at that point of the story is to guide Jack Frost through visions that greatly help him. He is surrounded by 'serpent' imagery, particularly apples, and at one point claims that his stories were written out of the Bible during the church meeting of Nicea. *The Harlequinade/The King in Yellow ‚Äì A group of three harlequins who occasionally guide the Invisibles. In their \\"King in Yellow\\" aspect, they are also seen as commanding Sir Miles. They at one point show Mister Six visions like those the Blind Chessman shows Jack Frost, asking Six to \\"rejoin the ultimate conspiracy\\". Mister Six later describes them as \\"as alien as the air between your fingers\\", and says that they are \\"like us\\" ‚Äì but it is still never resolved who or what exactly they are. What is clear is that they hold ownership over the Hand of Glory, and are associated with the act of stepping out of linear time. *John-A-Dreams ‚Äì John-A-Dreams, the Invisible who introduces Ragged Robin to King Mob's cell, is one of the more mysterious characters in the series. He vanishes in Philadelphia under unclear circumstances, and is replaced in King Mob's cell by Jack Frost. The Invisibles encounter him again at the Moonchild ceremony, by which time he has seemingly turned an agent of the Outer Church, but he does not actually prevent them from intervening in the ritual. Instead he explains that the Philadelphia experience sent him into a 'time machine' (e.g. allowed him to see and move behind the illusion of lineral time) and attempts to explain something about the nature of reality to Lord Fanny. Apparently several of the other characters have an aspect of him in themselves, despite having their own backstories: Mr. Quimper, a corrupted being of the Outer Church who dresses like John-A-Dreams, claims to have \\"once been called John\\"; and Jack Flint, an anti-Invisible agent who turns out to be an Invisible under cover who had forgotten that his assumed identity was a cover story, at one point after having his identities deconstructed says that \\"John-a-Dreams is a complex structure... there's a name we all used for a while\\". The deconstructed Flint, who has realized that he is both 'Jack Flint' and 'John-A-Dreams' appears to know exactly what is going to happen during the Moonchild ritual. Grant Morrison has stated that John is like a \\"midwife\\" for the world as it moves towards \\"birth\\", and that one should \\"always look for the white suit\\". Other characters in the series that occasionally wear white suits are Mr. Quimper, Elfayed, Orlando and The Blind Chessman.

Delacroix's first version of Women of Algiers was painted in Paris in 1834 and is located in the Louvre, Paris, France. The second work, painted fifteen years later between 1847 and 1849, is located at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier, France. The two works both depict the same scene of four women together in an enclosed room. Despite the similar setting, the two paintings evoke completely different moods through the depiction of the women. Delacroix's earlier 1834 work captures the separation between the women and the viewer. The second painting instead invites the viewer into the scene through the warm inviting gaze of the woman. Women of Algiers, along with Delacroix's other Orientalist paintings, has inspired many artists of later generations. In 1888 both Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin travelled to Montpellier to view Delacroix's 1849 version of Women of Algiers. The painting served as a source of inspiration to the later impressionists, and a series of 15 paintings and numerous drawings by Pablo Picasso in 1954.Picasso: Challenging the Past National Gallery p 109-114 1834 painting The 1834 painting was first displayed at the 1834 Salon in Paris, where it received mixed reviews. The art critic Gustave Plance wrote in a review for Revue des deux mondes that Delacroix's painting Femmes d'Alger dans leur Appartement was about painting and nothing more, painting that is fresh, vigorous, advanced with spirit, and of an audacity completely venetian, yet yielding nothing to the masters it recalls. King Louis Philippe purchased the painting in 1834 and presented it to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. In 1874 the painting was moved to the Louvre, Paris where it remains today as part of the permanent collection.Hagen, p. 361 The work depicts four women enclosed in a lavishly decorated room. Three of the women are sumptuously adorned with loose, billowing garments and gold jewellery. One woman has a pink flower in her hair. The fourth woman is a black slave who exits the scene, looking over her left shoulder towards the seated women. Delacroix perfectly rendered the features of the women's clothing, adornments, and the interior decor in great detail. This attention to details follows through from his 1832 Algerian sketches into the 1834 oil painting of the same scene. The painting has been applauded by scholars for its attempted ethnographic depiction, both in the relatively clothed forms of the females and the title of the painting itself, as it is devoid of the objectifying terms odalisque or harem. Delacroix's Women of Algiers does not depict an overtly eroticized version of the Oriental female, as other artists did, such as Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres' salacious depiction in his 1814 painting Grande Odalisque. Although there is a desire for realism to evoke the decorative mood, the work fails to extend the desire for realism to the women themselves, and the social customs of the harem. There is almost no narrative in the stagnant space. The women are cloistered together, not engaging with one another. The challenging stare of the women on the left reflects hostility towards the permeation of the private space. Aside from this glance there is no depiction of the nineteenth century social customs of the harems of elite Algerian culture. Ultimately Delacroix's stolen glance into the Algerian harem provided him with little visual information to create a realistic image. With these gaps in visual information Delacroix fills the voids with his own European interpretation, resulting in a subtler version of the fantasy female. With the exposed d√©colletage, loose unbounded clothing and languid poses, Delacroix's Algerian females are still situated in the European oriental dream. The addition of stereotypical Orientalist motifs, such as the narghile pipe, charcoal burner, and the odalisques pose. Together they create a fictional image that parallels the European fantasy of the harem more than reality. The nineteenth century European viewer's connotations of the \\"narghile pipe\\" with smoking hashish or opium, as well as the connotations of the loose unbound clothing to sexual immorality, added to this Western fantasy. History The French conquest of Algeria started in 1830 and affected France's relationship with nearby countries, such as Morocco. Towards the end of 1831 King Louis Phillipe sent a diplomatic party to Morocco in order to establish friendly relations and negotiate a treaty with the Sultan. He assigned the young diplomat Charles de Mornay. At that time it was common to take artists along, in order to visually document the journey.Pages from the Morocco Notebook 1832, watercolor, 19√ó13cm. Mus√©e du Louvre, Departement des Arts graphiques, Paris. Accessed on 13 September 2010 Delacroix joined the diplomatic party by chance through social connections. Previously, when Delacroix was studying under Pierre Gu√©rin, he had become friends with a fellow student, Henri Duponchel, who had recently become director of scenic design at the Paris Opera (and would later become its managing director). Duponchel was in the social circle of Mornay's mistress, the actress Mademoiselle Mars, and recommended Delacroix for this assignment.Marrinan 2009, pp. 195‚Äì196.Hagen, p. 358 Delacroix joined the party and together they set sail in 1831 and arrived in Tangiers, Morocco, on 25 January 1832. Delacroix greatly relished the atmosphere, the colours, the objects, the people, and the architecture of this exotic world. Delacroix recorded everything in his journals. During his six-month trip Delacroix filled seven large sketchbooks and created an album of eighteen watercolours. Delacroix was invited into Jewish households to sketch. His 1832 journal recounts in detail the clothing, interior d√©cor, and festivities of the Jewish households and he drew several small sketches of the Jewish families and households. From these he later painted the works Jewish Wedding in Morocco (c.1841) and Jewish Bride (c.1832). Delacroix found it significantly harder to sketch Arabic women, due to religious constrictions. Despite this setback Delacroix still attempted to sketch the Arabic women. As soon as he would seek to sketch them from afar, the Arabic women who would hang their washing out on roof terraces would immediately alert their husbands. Delacroix returned home via Spain, and Algeria, where he stayed for three days. By luck he was at the Algerian port where he met a merchant who gave him access to his households private harem. Delacroix created two small sketches of the women in the Algerian harem that he later used to create his oil painting Women of Algiers. Orientalism The nineteenth century concept of North Africa was a warped and fantasised interpretation of the foreign countries. Ottoman Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and India were all condensed under the enigmatic category of \\"The Orient\\". It was perceived as a timeless, exotic land of fantasy and adventure. This ignorant understanding had been developing since the seventeenth century with the introduction of Chinese and Japanese culture and aesthetics into Europe by the Jesuits. Many fictional works were paraded as fact, such as Montesquieu's 1721 book Persian Letters. A fictional set of correspondence that satirically recounted the European character's response to North Africa. These books, as well as other paintings, drawings, literature, photographs, and travel diaries, created preconceptions that coloured the travelling artists interpretation of their surroundings in North Africa. French Orientalist painting took off with Napoleon's Egyptian campaign of 1798, the year in which Delacroix was born. French fascination again increased during the Greek revolution in 1821‚Äì30, during which time Victor Hugo authored the volume of poems Les Orientales and Delacroix contributed two paintings, The Massacre at Chios (1824) and Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Messolonghi (1826). By the nineteenth century this warped myth had developed into a perceived truth and each subsequent piece of information on North Africa validated, and in turn propagated this Oriental myth. European depiction of the harem was almost perpetually dependent on the Oriental myth. European male artists were unable to obtain access to the harem and so relied upon visits to brothels and their own imagination to conjure a fantasy image of the space. Research has shown that even first hand accounts by female artists and writers who had the opportunity to enter local harems were slightly embellished. These fantasy depictions regularly eroticized and objectified the spaces, see Jean- L√©on G√©r√¥me's 1876 Pool in a harem, for example. Eug√®ne Delacroix had the benefit of physically visiting a harem in 1832, albeit very briefly. Although he had his own visual interpretation of the scene, it was captured from one brief stolen glance that was marred by a lifetime of preconceptions. The European myth of the harem fantasy intensified in the nineteenth century with the ready availability of the book Arabian Nights (also known as Thousand and One Nights). Antoine Galland first translated it into French in 1717. The enormously popular book of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries painted a picture of a timeless fantasy world of exotic adventure. The influence of this tale on travelling artist's first hand absorption and interpretation of visual information is discussed in Mary Roberts's book Intimate Outsiders. Delacroix himself paralleled his experiences in North Africa to the Arabian Nights. In a letter to Alexis de Tocqueville several years after his trip he mentioned, \\"Never in my life have I observed anything more bizarre than the first sight of Tangier. It is a tale out of the Thousand and One Nights... A prodigious mix of races and costumes...This whole world moves about with an activity that seems feverish.\\"  1847‚Äì1849 painting  Femmes d‚ÄôAlger dans leur Appartement The second painting was created between 1847 and 1849 and currently resides at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France. The composition of the figures remains the same, however the women are now depicted as smaller figures and fade back into the background. The melody of gold, burnt umber, and red tones blending together creates a hazy, dreamlike reverie. Instead of leaving the scene the black slave is now lifting away the curtain to reveal the seated women to the viewer. The women on the left wears a lower plunging neckline revealing her d√©colletage and she now stares softly at the viewer with a warm, inviting gaze. The second painting was created fifteen years after the 1834 original. In comparison, the viewer can see the influence of time and nostalgia upon the interpretation of visual information. The slightly fantasied scene has been transformed into a picture of pure nostalgia. The European concept of the harem further implants itself within Delacroix's work, ultimately creating a painting that objectifies and eroticizes the Algerian women to a greater extent than the original 1834 version.

Cairo is the hub of almost the entire Egyptian transport network.  Transport today  Part of the city centre road system in Cairo = Road system = An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a ring road that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach to almost every Cairo district. There are flyovers and bridges such as the Sixth of October Bridge, designed to allow fast and efficient means of transport from one side of the city to the other; in practice, however, Cairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded, with traffic jams frequently increasing travel time far beyond the theoretical speed. During the period between 2014 and 2020, many roads were expanded and upgraded, such as the El Moshir Tantawy Axis which connects New Cairo to other neighborhoods in Eastern and Central Cairo, and the Cairo-Suez Road which connects Cairo to El Rehab, Madinaty, El Shorouk, Badr and the New Administrative Capital. The ring road is also undergoing an expansion as of September 2020, which aims to increase the number of lanes to seven or eight, instead of three or four. Many neighborhoods in Cairo have unplanned buildings, which resulted in an increasing population density in these areas, so neighborhoods such as Heliopolis and Nasr City had congested streets almost daily and at all times. In late 2019, the government decided to tackle this problem by constructing a large number of overpasses inside these neighborhoods in order to remove intersections and u-turns that resulted in congestion, more than 8 overpasses were constructed in Heliopolis, and over 12 overpasses were built in Nasr City, with Mostafa El Nahas Street alone (a major axis in Nasr City) having four of them. These structures did fulfill their intended purpose, which was to eliminate traffic congestion in these areas, but they received criticism due to many reasons, one of which was the removal of many green spaces in Heliopolis, and the danger they posed for pedestrians crossing the streets. = Bus system = There are two types of buses in Cairo, those run by the Cairo Transport Authority, and those run by private companies, with the latter using smaller minibuses. Bus lines are spread all over the Greater Cairo area, and are considered the main mean of transport for many Cairenes. The tickets for the CTA buses cost anywhere from 4 L.E to 15 L.E, depending on the type of bus itself, and whether it's air conditioned or not, while tickets for buses run by private companies cost 5 L.E. The ticket costs were considerably lower, but due to the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound back in 2016, and the government's decision to gradually remove subsidies (which affected gas prices), the prices were increased. In recent years, other bus services such as Uber Bus, Careem bus and Swvl increased in popularity.https://egyptindependent.com/egypt-becomes-first- country-to-debut-new-intercity-uber-bus- service/https://egyptianstreets.com/2017/05/29/swvl-an-egyptian-startup-out- to-reinvent-urban-mass-transit/ =Air= Satellite shot of Cairo International Airport. The largest airport in Egypt, Cairo International Airport, is located near in the Heliopolis district and is accessible by car, taxi and bus. The third line of the Cairo Metro, opened in 2012, was originally planned to reach the Airport, but those plans were cancelled in mid-2020 in place of a future shuttle bus system that runs directly from Adly Mansour Station to the Airport.https://www.youm7.com/story/2020/7/8/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%80/4866381 The Cairo Airport Shuttle Bus also operates all over Cairo for trips to or from the airport. Cairo International Airport is the busiest airport in Egypt and the primary hub for Star Alliance member and flag carrier EgyptAir. The airport is located to the north-east of the city around 15 km from the business area of the city. The airport is administered by the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation (EHCAAN), which controls four companies including: Cairo Airport Co., Egyptian Airports Co., National Air Navigation Services and Aviation Information Technology and the Cairo Airport Authority (CAA), which is the regulatory body. Cairo International is the second busiest airport in Africa after Johannesburg International Airport in South Africa. Cairo Airport handles about 3,400 daily flights, more than 12,100 weekly flights and about 125,000 yearly flights. The airport has three terminals with the third (Terminal 3) opening in April 2009 which houses EgyptAir and its Star Alliance partners. There are also three runways (a fourth runway was opened in early 2009) and a single cargo terminal. Runway 05L/23R is 3,300m long, 05R/23L has a length of 4,000m and 16/34 is 3,180m (all of the runways are 60m wide). The fourth runway, south of the existing airfield is 4,000m by 65m and suitable for the Airbus A380. With the assimilation of EgyptAir into Star Alliance in July 2008 the airport has the potential to be a major hub with its positioning between Africa, the Middle East and Europe (especially with facilities for the A380). In 2008, the airport served 14,360,175 passengers (+14.2% vs. 2007) and handled just over 138,000 aircraft movements (+12.4% vs. 2007). According to Airports Council International statistics, of the top 100 airports in the world, CAI reported the highest growth rate of any airport in 2008. Cairo is also planned to be served by a new airport in the New Administrative Capital, which has been fully constructed but is not yet fully operational. =Taxis= Cairo is served by its \\"white taxis\\" which have been introduced in the early 2010s and aren't run by a company, but rather by individuals. These taxis have plummeted in popularity, due to things such as the drivers not turning on their meters and instead demanding a fare which is usually considerably inflated, and other problems such as the lack of air-conditioning. The main reason, however, is the introduction of applications like Uber, which have become the main option instead of taxis. This has been met by protests from cab drivers, going as far as demanding a ban of these services.http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/187252/Egypt/Politics-/Cairo- taxi-drivers-press-demands-to-shut-down-Uber.aspx = Cairo Metro = The Cairo Metro is the first rapid transit system in Greater Cairo, Egypt and the first of only two full-fledged metro systems in Africa and only four in the Arab world. It was opened in 1987 as Line 1 from Helwan to Ramsis square, with a length of 29 kilometres (18.0 mi). As of 2014, the Cairo Metro has 61 stations (mostly At-grade), of which three are transfer stations, with a total length of 77.9 kilometres (48.4 mi). The system consists of three operational lines numbered from 1 to 3. As of 2013, the metro carried nearly 4 million passengers per day. The cost of the Metro was 1LE to go anywhere until 2017, when it rose to 2LE (still heavily subsidized). The Cairo Metro is run by the National Authority for Tunnels. The lines use standard gauge (1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1‚ÅÑ2 in)). = Tram = Tramway network Constructed near the beginning of the 20th century, until 2014, the Cairo tramway network was still used in modern- day Cairo, especially in modern areas, like Heliopolis, Nasr City. During the 1970s government policies favoured making space for cars, resulting in the removal of over half of the 120 km network. Trams were removed entirely from central Cairo but continued to run in Heliopolis and Helwan. However, in 2015, the tramway rails were removed and the streets and side walks became wider. The reason is that it has been rarely used by anyone during the past decade as it is a slow mean of transportation and it has a limited geographical coverage. = Limousine service = This service uses a luxury sedan or saloon car driven by chauffeur to drive passengers from the airport or other locations to their destination. There are types of limousine services the main one is Airport limousine and the second one to transport people from town to town in Egypt. = Train = Cairo is extensively connected to other Egyptian cities and villages by rail operated by the Egyptian National Railways. Cairo's main railway station - Ramses Station (Mahattat Ramses) is located on Midan Ramses. = Nile ferry = There's a maritime ferry boat system that crosses the Nile River. Here's an article from 2005 about the Nile Bus system. There is also a brief article, published in Al Ahram 2014 about the Nile Bus system. = Monorail = In 2015 plans to construct two monorail systems were announced, one linking October City to suburban Giza, a distance of 42km, and the other linking Nasr City to New Cairo, a distance of 54km. They will be Egypt's first monorail systems. In May 2019 the contract to build 70 four-car trains was awarded to Bombardier Transportation with assembly to take place at its Derby Litchurch Lane Works in England. Delivery of the trains is expected between 2021 and 2024. The network is to be built by Orascom Construction and Arab Contractors.

Ayu Khandro (Long Life Dakini), also known as Dorje Paldr√∂n, lived from 1839 to 1953. She was a practitioner, yogini, and terton of Tibetan Buddhism in Eastern Tibet. An accomplished Dzogchen meditator, she is renowned for her extensive pilgrimages throughout Tibet, long periods of dark retreatknown in Tibetan as Yangti Nagpo practice, the gongtera directly revealed text, terma, in the mind of the practitioner of the practice of the yidam Senge Dongma (the Lion-Faced Dakini), various forms of Ch√∂d,The Dzinpa Rangdr√∂l sadhana cycle was one among the many forms of Ch√∂d that she practiced and transmitted. and her lifelong dedication to spiritual practice. The information we have about Ayu Khandro comes from the oral commentary that she personally gave to Chogyal Namkhai Norbu in Dzongsa, 1951. He wrote her namthar, or spiritual biography, which was later published in Women of Wisdom by Tsultrim Allione. Ayu Khandro met, and was taught by, many great masters of her day ; Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgon Kongtrul the First, Chokgyur Lingpa, Nyala Pema D√ºndul, Adzom Drukpa, Togden Rangrig and the ninth Tai Situpa, Pema Nyingche Wangpo. She led the life of a hidden yogini, spending a significant amount of her life in retreat or as a wandering chodma.female practitioner of chod She was recognised as an emanation of Vajrayogini.  Early life (1839‚Äì1846)  Ayu Khandro was born in Kham, Eastern Tibet, in the village of Dzong Trang. Present at her birth, in the winter of 1839, was a local Togden,rtogs ldan - 'endowed with realization', an epiphet for a highly realized yogi Togden Rangrig, with whose community she joined at the age of seven. He gave her the name Dechen Khandro (Great Bliss Dakini). Others reported auspicious signs at her birth and she was born on the day of the dakini,In the Tibetan calendar this is the 25th day of the lunar month which is a significant day in the Tibetan Calendar. Her parents were Tsokyi (mother) and Tamdrin Gon (father). She grew up in the youngest in a family of three sons and four daughters; living a traditional Khampa lifestyle where the women looked after the animals and the men were traders. \\"Since I was the youngest and the weakest I was sent to look after the small animals and given the worst clothes.\\"  Leaving home and early meditation training (1846-1857)  Togden Rangrig had a small community of meditators in the caves of a nearby mountain to where Ayu Khandro lived. This place was called Drag ka Yang Dzong. Her Aunt, Dronkyi, was a member of this community and lived in a cave near that of the Togden. At the age of seven, in 1846, Ayu Khandro went to join them. She assisted them in retreat, bringing fire wood and water. During this period she learned how to read and write Tibetan with Kunzang Longyang, a skill in which she reached a good level of proficiency, reading the Kangyur twice with the community. At the age of 13, Ayu Khandro received her first initiation, the Longsal Dorje Nyingpo (The Vajra Essence of the Clear Expanse).a terma (treasure) teaching rediscovered by Rigdzin Longsal Nyingpo (1625-1692) Following the pattern of many yoginis she was betrothed against her will.For example, see the biographies of Machig Labdron, Drenchen Rema, Nangsa Obum, Yeshe Tsogyal, and Mandarava After her aunt's intercession the marriage was delayed until she was 19. In Kham, at this time, there were many important and accomplished Rinpoches.tibetan for 'precious one', an individual who has been recognised as the incarnation of a previous spiritual master Yet there are three that stand out among the others: Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgon Kongtrul the 1st and Chokgyur Lingpa. They were all proponents of the Rime movement in Tibet. When Ayu Khandro was 14, she travelled with Togden Rangrig and Dronkyi to see these three teachers consecrate Dzong Tsho (Fortress Lake). Here she met many other masters and received considerable meditation instruction. On the return journey, we have the first mention of her meeting the 9th Tai Situpa, Pema Nyingche Wangpo from whom she received instruction on the meditation yidam White Tara. Back at Drag ka Yang Dzong, she dedicated her time to the Ngondro of the Longchen Nyingtig lineage under the guidance of Kunzang Longyang. Two years later, in 1854, she made another pilgrimage to see her root teacher Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. Although he was in retreat due, he gave Ayu Khandro teachings on his White Tara terma, called the Pema Nyingtig (Heart Essence of the Lotus) for over a month and the spiritual name Tsewang Paldron (Glorious Life Empowerment). On return to Togden Rangrig, Ayu Khandro dedicated herself to this practice.  Marriage and Illness (1857‚Äì1865)  In the summer of 1857, against her own and her aunt Dronkyi's wishes, Ayu Khandro was married to Apho Wangdo of the wealthy Gara Tsong family. She stayed with her husband, who was kind and generous, for three years. Yet, after this, Ayu Khandro fell ill to an undiagnosable illnesspossible prana (air) disease, convulsions, circulation problems and was in weakened health for the next two years. With no improvement or response to any treatment and near death, Togden Rangrig and Dronkyi were called and they stated that Ayu Khandro's marriage was blocking her strong orientation and propensity to meditation practice causing her to become ill. Apho Wangdo agreed to alter their relationship to one of vajra brother and sister and thus Ayu Khandro slowly recovered. Ayu Khandro then returned to the caves of Drag ka Yang Dzong, where she spent a year recovering, assisted by a nun in the community. During this year she began to receive teachings again, namely the terma of Guru Chowang.Terton of the 13th Century, consort of the yogini and Ch√∂d practitioner Jomo Memo. While she was recovering she had a dream that indicated the death of her mentor Togden Rangrig. On her request he gave her a meditation practice to extend his life and he lived another 3 years. As well as living most of her life with him and him being present at her birth he gave her all the teachings he received from his teachers; Motrul Choying Dorje, Migyur Namkhai Dorje - the Fourth Dzogchen Drubwang and Rigdzin Pema Dupa Tsel. At this time he also gave her the teachings on the Dzogchen of Nyima Drapa, from the terton Nyima Odzer (1124‚Äì92).one of greatest tertons and the first terton king Now having the freedom and health to practice Ayu Khandro, now 23 or 24, dedicated herself to extended, serious meditation.  Death and Retreat (1865‚Äì1868)  Yet in 1865, at 77, Togden Rangrig died. The sign of an accomplished meditator his body remained in final meditation posture, Thukdam, for seven days. After this period his body was the size of an eight year old. This dissolution of the body into the elements at the time of death is called the rainbow body and is the highest attainment of Dzogchen meditation. At the time of cremation signs of the meditative realization of the practitioner can appear. and at Ayu Khandro was present for this, and she recalled: \\" As we were making the funeral pyre and preparing the body to be burned everyone heard a loud noise like a thunderclap. A strange half-snow half-rain fell.\\" At the end of the cremation they found that Dronkyi, her aunt and spiritual companion since she was 7 had left her body at the age of 62. Dronkyi remained in seated meditation position for 3 days after her death, a sign of high spiritual attainment. She too was cremated on the same spot as Togden Rangrig. Sounds from the cremation pyre were reported by many people. The close time of death of Togden Rangrig and Dronkyi could indicate that they were a spiritual couple,other examples include; Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyel, Sera Khandro and Drime Ozer and more recently Tare Lhamo and Namtrul Rinpoche practicing the highest levels of buddhist meditation known as karmamudra. In Tibetan Buddhism realized beings are often shown in union or yabyumliterally in Tibetan 'father-mother' representing the union of wisdom and compassion. In response to these events Ayu Khandro entered a strict 3 year retreat in Dronkyi's cave.  Pilgrimage in Eastern Tibet (1868‚Äì71)  = Adzom Gar, Tromtar Region, Kham - Teachers; Namkhai Dorje, Nyala Pema Dundel (1868) = Before Togden Rangrig had died he instructed Ayu Khandro to visit Nyala Pema Dundel, a terton and accomplished teacher of Dzogchen. So when she was 30 she left for Adzom Gar with Kunzang Longyang and the nun who had assisted her in retreat. Travelling for over a month and a half visiting sacred places, they arrived before Nyala Pema Dundel's teachings. So they then received the teaching Adzom's Drukpa uncle, Namkhai Dorje, was giving to Adzom Drukpa on Longde (space series). _Practices received from Namkhai Dorje_ Longde _Practices received from Nyala Pema Dundel_ The Tshog Chen Dupa, the Tara Gonpa Rangdro, a practice for the time of death and his gongter the Kha Khyab Rangdrol. = Dzogchen and Sechen Monastery, Derge Region, Kham = Ayu Khandro now travelled with some of Adzom Drukpa's students to 2 famous and important Nyingma Monasteries, Dzogchen and Sechen. An accomplished Chodpa, Lhawang Gonpa, instructed her on Tummomade famous by Milarepa (Inner Heat Practice) and Chulen (Extracting the Essence); this allowed her to live comfortably through the intense cold at Dzogchen. It was here that she met an important female figure in her life, Pema Yangkyi, with whom she travelled, practiced and established a deep friendship with for many years. _Practices taught by Lhawang Gonpo_ Chod, Tummo, Chulen = Gonchen Monastery, Derge Region, Kham (1869) = = Tashi Lhatse, Marcho - Teacher; Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1869) = Aged 31, she travelled with Lhawang Gonpo, Pema Yangkyi, Jigme, a khenpo from Dzogchen and 10 of his disciples to see Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. Yet when they arrived he could n't be reached as he was in strict retreat so they went to Katu Payal Monastery. The 3 friends then adopted a vagabond lifestyle, begging, so they could return to Marcho. As Khyentse was still in retreat they decided to also begin intensive practice nearby. After a month, a monk called Sonam Wangpo visited and told Khyentse of their presence and he decided to secretly teach them. Teachings commenced on Jomo Memo's anniversary, when she attained the rainbow body. She was an important female terton (treasure revealer) whose terma (treasure), the Khandro Sangdu (Secret Gathering of the Dakinis), Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo rediscovered through his terma. = Dzongsar Monastery, Derge Region = When they had finished receiving teachings and practiced they returned to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo's monastery, Dzongsar. There with hundreds others they received the Nyingtik Yabzhi4 series on Man. Ngag.sDe, leads to development of Thodgal for 3 months. She also received from him numerous teachings from across the 4 schools Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug of Tibetan Buddhism and teachings from Teachers from all over Tibet who were also present. _Practices received from Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo_ Khandro Sangdu, Nyingtik Yabzhi = Karko, Nyarong Region - Teacher; Nyala Pema Dundel (1870) = At 31 Ayu Khandro and her close friend, Pema Yangkyi, continued their pilgrimage to see Nyala Pema Dundel in Karko, with some of Khyentse's disciples. Here they received the Longsal Dorje Nyingpo (The Vajra Essence of the Clear Expanse), a teaching that was her first initiation at the age of 13. Another important teaching that she received here was the Yangti Nagpo, also known as the dark retreat, a practice Ayu Khandro dedicated many years to later in her life. They remained here for 3 months.  Nying Lung, Tsela Wongdo  Nyala Pema Dundel was travelling to Nying Lung in the Tsela Wongdo area and they decided to travel with him to receive the Kha Khyab Rangdrol. He called for them at the end of the teachings and gave them Dharma names,this is a practice given to create a link with the teacher and lineage Dorje Paldron (Glorious Indestructible Vajra) for Ayu Khandro and Osel Palkyi (Glorious Clear Light) for Pema Yangkyi. He also gave them important practice advice, \\"Go to practice in cemeteries and sacred places. Follow the method of Machig Labdronpractice of Chod and overcome hope and fear. If you do this you will attain stable realization. During your travel you will encounter 2 yogis who will be important for you.\\" Giving them a Chod drum each, they set off with only drum and stick. _Teachings received from Nyala Pema Dundel_ Longsal Dorje Nyingpo, Yangti Nagpo, Kha Khyab Rangdrol = Katok and Palyul Monasteries = = Return to the Caves of Togden Randgrig (1871) = Aged 31 Ayu Khandro and Pema Yangkyi arrived at her old home, Drag ka Yang Dzong, where the caves of her old mentor Togden Rangrig and her aunt Dronkyi were. The only people left were a young nun Chang Chub, an old disciple Togden Pagpa and Kunzang Longyang. They stayed for a period of 2 weeks performing Guru Yoga, feast offerings and practice of the Guardians. Then after a fire puja the 2 friends and Kunzang Longyang left for pilgimage around Central Tibet.  Pilgrimage to Central Tibet through Southern Tibet (1871‚Äì73)  = Tsawa = The first place of pilgrimage was the region of Tsawa, with which they reached with about 20 other people also traveling on pilgrimage to Central Tibet. As instructed by Nyala Pema Dundel they begged for their food. On one of their alms rounds on the plateau of Gurchen Thang they came by a large encampment of nomads. Sitting to sing the Ch√∂d practice they were approached by a young woman whose husband had been murdered. Neither of them had any experience dealing with funerals yet as dealing with the dead and especially those who died in unfavorable ways is strongly connected to Ch√∂d they agreed.Traveling to a cemetery to the south they came across another wandering male Ch√∂d practitioner. They then remembered Nyala Pema Dundel's prophecy that they would meet a Chodpa who would help them in Tsawa. On meeting them the Chodpa asked which one of them was Dorje Paldron? He then stated, \\" I am a disciple of Khyentse Yeshe Dorje (Do Khyentse), my name is Semnyi Dorje and I was born in Kongpo. I have no fixed abode. I have been practicing here for the last few days. Several days ago when I was between sleeping and waking I received a communication that someone called Dorje Paldron was coming.\\" He then offered to help them with murdered corpse and they all practiced for 7 days. Semnyi Dorje also gave them teachings on the Dzinpa Rangdrol'Natural Liberation of Grasping' Ch√∂d. _Teachings received from Togden Semnyi Dorje_ Dzinpa Rangdrol Chod of Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje = Zayu near Assam (1871‚Äì1872) = = Tsari, Chikchar = Ayu Khandro, Pema Yangkyi, Kunzang Longyang and Togden Semnyi stayed in this area of Zayu and Tsari for a year and 3 months meditating in important pilgrimage places. Tsari is one of the 3 most important sacred mountains (the others being Kailash and Labchi) in Tibet and an area synonymous with pilgrimage and the sacred in the Tibetan Buddhist worldview. This is due to all 3 mountains being part of the 24 sacred places of the mandala of Chakrasmabhava and Vajravahari. Tsari is also associated with Shambala. = Death of Kunzang Longyang (1872) = In 1872 their companion Kunzang Longyang who had joined them from Togden Rangrig's caves died after intense fever at the age of 56. At the funeral which Ayu Khandro, Pema Yangkyi and Togden Semnyi performed there were many auspicious signs of accomplishment and a rainbow. They stayed there for another 3 months doing practice for Kunzang Longyang. = Lhodrak,now known as Lhozang County Jar and Pema Ling (1872) = Guru Chowang Lhodrak is the heartland of the famous Kagyu patriarch Marpa Lotsawa and where the esteemed Tibetan yogi Milarepa performed his spiritual hardships before initiation. Guru Chowang was also born here in 1212. He was the teacher and consort of Jomo Memo, a female terton from whose teachings, the Khandro Sangdu, Ayu Khandro had received from Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. South west of Lhodrak is the lake at Pema Ling which is next to the mountain Kula Kangri on the border of Bhutan. The lake was especially significant to Ayu Khandro as a place of pilgrimage as many accomplished meditators had lived and practiced there. = Meeting Trulzi Garwang Rinpoche in Rona (1872) = Ayu Khandro's close friend Pema Yangkyi went to Rona where she met a yogi called Gargyi Wanchug (also known as Trulzi Garwang Rinpoche). This fulfilled Nyala Pema Dundel's prophecy about meeting 2 important yogis, one in Southern Tibet. On meeting Gargyi stated: \\" Three months ago I was practicing in Ralung, the original seat of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage, and I had a vision of Dorje Yudronma. She gave me a little roll of paper about as long as my finger. I quickly unrolled it and it said 'In the tenth month of the tenth day go in practice to a place called Rona.\\" Trulzi Garwang Rinpoche had a large following around the lake at Pema Ling and was a student of the female teacher Mindroling Jetsun Rinpoche, learning the Dzogchen termas of Mindroling from her. Here they learnt more Chod from him with his students and practiced intensively, completing the 100 000 Chod feast offerings.  Pilgrimage to Western Tibet (via Nepal) (1873  After meeting Trulzi Rinpoche they once again became four; Ayu Khandro and Togden Semnyi, Pema Yangkyi and Trulzi Rinpoche. As Trulzi Rinpoche was going to Mount Kailash (Gang Rinpoche) in Western Tibet they decided to join him. = Yamdrok Yumtso (1873) = Their first stop was Yamdrok Lake, one of the four holiest lakes in Tibet especially connected to divination. It is an area also associated with Padmasambhava. = Ralung (1873) = They stayed here for over a month while Trulzi Garwang gave teachings on Ati ZadonDzogchen terma of Zigpo Lingpa (1829-70) to some of his students. _Practice from Trulzi Garwang_ Ati Zadon = Gyaltse, Shigatse, Shalu, Sakya, Tsang Region (1873) = = Tingri (1873) = For the summer months they lived and practiced in Tingri, the holy area associated with the Indian Mahasiddha Padampa Sangye, one of the forefathers of Chod, with his practice of Shijay or Pacification.  Pilgrimage in Nepal (1873)  Travelling south from Tingri they began their pilgrimage to some of the places associated with the power places of the mandala of Chakrasambhava/Vajrayogini in Nepal. Having to go through the areas near the sacred areas that Milarepa practiced and crossing the Himalayas they entered Nepal at Nyalam, which is now on the Friendship Highway. = Maratika (Halesi Mahadevsthan) = Their first major pilgrimage destination was the famous cave of Maratika. This area is associated with long life practice as it is the place where Padmasambhava and the dakini Mandarava attained the longlife practice of Amitayus. Here they practiced White Tara (especially associated with long life) and the Pema Nyintik (Heart essence of the lotus) of her teacher Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. Here Ayu Khandro and Pema Yangkyi gave the transmission of the Pema Nyingtik to Togden Trulzi. = Kathmandu and the Stupa of Swayambhu = From Maratika they travelled west to the ancient capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, part of the sacred mandala of Chakrasambhava. Moving through the sacred sites of the Kathmandu valley and especially the famous stupa of Swayambhu for a month they made offerings and then practiced Chod for another month. They started to become quite well known receiving many invitations, yet seeing this as the obstacle of fame they left the area. = Yangleshohttp://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Yanglesh%C3%B6_cave in Parping and Dakshinkali = Moving south west of Kathmandu they arrived at Yanglesho in Parphing, for the important pilgrimage cave of Padmasambhava and his Nepalese consort Shakyadevi. The other cave in Parphing is the Asura Cave and they visited the Vajrayogini Temple, part of the 24 tantric powerplaces of Chakrasambhava and Vajrayogini. A few miles south of Parphing they travelled to one of the most famous tantric Hindu shrines, the temples of the goddess Kali, Dakshinkali. = Purang, Kyung Lung, Dolpo (1874) = Moving west out of the Kathmandu valley they passed through Purang, heading for Dolpo and arrived at a previous practice cave of Togden Trulzhi, Kyung Lung. Here they received an in depth teaching and transmission of the Khandro Nyingtik from Togden Trulzhi. They also gave the transmission of the Khandro Sangdu of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo to Togden Trulzhi.  Mount Kailash (Gang Rinpoche - Precious Jewel of Snows) (1874‚Äì77)  In 1874 all four pilgrims arrived at Mount Kailash, entering from western Nepal. Mount Kailash is a deeply sacred place to the 4 religions, Buddhism, Bon, Hinduism and Jainism. Many famous and not so famous saints practiced here including Milarepa and Padmasambhava. In Buddhism Mount Kailash is seen as the home of Chakrasambhava. We have seen throughout her pilgrimage the theme of visiting the sacred powerplaces of Chakrasambhava and Vajrayogini. Togden Trulzi guided them here and they spent over 3 years here meditating in many sacred caves and visiting many pilgrimage places. After this period Pema Yangkyi and Togden Trulzi decided to stay, whereas Ayu Khandro and Togden Semnyi decided to go to Central Tibet.  The Return Home - Pilgrimage to Central Tibet (1877)  At first they went to Maryul (what is now known as Ladakh) practicing Chod along the way, including Jomo Nagpa, the residence of Taranatha. = Tanang and Ngang Cho (1877) = Here resided Gyurme Pema Tenzin, a Dzogchen meditation master with whom they stayed for 9 months receiving teachings on Dzogchen Semde. They also received full teachings in the 18 series of Dzogchen which included initiations and explanations. _Teachings received from Gyurme Pema Tenzin_ Semde, the 18 series of Dzogchen = Usang and Lhasa (1878) = When Ayu Khandro was 40 they arrived in the Central province of TIbet called Usang (or U) meaning literally front Tibet. At first they visited the shrine of the Blue Vajra Sadhu a protector of Dzogchen. Then they arrived in Lhasa the capital of Usang and where the Dalai Lama resided. They visited all the holy places here, including Sera, Drepung, Trayepa, Ganden, Katsal, Zvalakang. Moving into the surrounding valley out of Lhasa they also visited Yangri, Drigung and Tidrom.

He has ceased wearing clerical attire, that according to Mehdi Khalaji, is in order to \\"disassociate himself with the pro-regime establishment\\".https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/10/iran- primer-politics-and-the-clergy.html Education and career As a student in Qom, Shabestari studied with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Ayatollah Allameh Tabatabaei. He was influenced by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's idea that \\"Islamic ethics was not limited\\" to \\"personal relationships\\", but should be \\"reflected in the state and its form of government.\\"Mohammad Shabestari Faith, Freedom, and Reason He stayed in the seminary for seventeen years, achieving both degrees of Ijtihad (religious adjudication) and Doctor of Philosophy. In the spirit of the political Shia in 1960s and 1970s Iran, Shabestari also felt closely associated with the thinking of religious intellectuals such as Jalal Al-e Ahmad and Ali Shariati, as well as the politically motivated cleric Morteza Motahhari. From 1970-1978, Shabestari served as director of the Shiite Islamic Center in the Imam Ali Mosque in Hamburg, Germany. He followed in this position Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti (who was to become one of the main architects of the Islamic revolution of Iran) and was later succeeded in this position by future president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, hojatoleslam Mohammad Khatami. During the period he spent in Hamburg, Shabestari strongly supported the Christian-Islamic dialogue and extended the mosque‚Äôs scope of influence by opening it up to all Muslims. He also learned German and was able to pursue his interest, already evident in Qom, in Western philosophy and Christian, especially Protestant, theology. He studied the writings of theologians such as Paul Tillich, Karl Barth, and Karl Rahner, as well as the thinking of philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Hans- Georg Gadamer. Upon his return to Iran, he served as a member of the first parliament (Majles of Iran) after the revolution, but distanced himself from politics afterwards. Shabestari was a full professor of Islamic philosophy at the University of Tehran from 1985-2006, where he also taught comparative religion and theology. He regularly organized international conferences on the theme of Christian-Muslim dialogue. He is one of the editors of the Great Encyclopedia of Islam, published in Tehran, and chairs the department of Theology and Sects of the Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia.The Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia. Department of Theology & Sects So far 16 volumes have been published of the encyclopedia, covering the first five letters of the alphabet.  His philosophy and contributions  Although Shabestari has made a modest contribution to the introduction and application of modern hermeneutics to traditional Shiite theology and jurisprudence, and thus to the proposition of variability of religious knowledge, his most significant contribution seems to be his authoritative commentary on the essentially limited nature of religious knowledge and rules, and thus the necessity of complementing it with extra-religious sources. Shabestari argues that distinguishing the eternal (values), from the changeable (instances and applications) in religion needs a kind of knowledge that is not, itself, contained in the rules developed in Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh). He laments the lack of such a body of knowledge in Islamic society: In the same vein, he underscores the limited nature of religious knowledge in general, and religious jurisprudence, in particular.(10) In Shabestari's view, what is essential and eternal is the general values of Islam not particular forms of their realization in any particular historic time, (including the time of the prophet): > The meaning of perfection of religion (Ekmal e Din) is not that it contains > everything under the sun, so that if we were unable to find a specific item > in it, we could go off calling it imperfect. It is not perfection for > religion to function as a substitute for science, technology, and human > deliberation. Also, > Religion does not wish to replace science and technology, and lay claim to > the place of reason ... God has only offered answers for some of the needs > of human beings. As for other needs, He has left it to reason and human > effort to supply the answer. Shabestari even suggests that there has been a divine providence for a separation of religious values and secular realities: In his latest book, Naghdi Bar Ghera'at e Rasmi az Din (A Critique of the Official Reading of Religion, December, 2000) Shabestari pursues his critique of religious absolutism as hermeneutically naive and realistically unworkable. Also, he launches a major defense of modern concepts of individualism, democracy, and human rights, although they have not been articulated as such in Islamic sources. In Shabestari‚Äôs view, human rights and democracy are products of human reason that have developed during the course of time and continue to evolve. As such, they are not already prescribed in the Koran and Sunna. Indeed, the Qur'an remains mute with regard to our modern understanding of human rights, and yet these do not in any way contradict the divine truth contained in the Qur'an. Drawing on modern hermeneutics, Shabestari dismisses any claim that man could ever come into direct possession of God‚Äôs absolute truth. Since the early 1990s, he has been increasingly active in publishing articles in liberal daily papers and magazines in which he argues for a new, more critical approach to religion.Farzin Vahdat: \\"Post-revolutionary Islamic modernity in Iran: the intersubjective hermeneutics of Mohamad Mojtahed Shabestari\\" in Suha Taji-Farouki (ed): Modern Muslim Intellectuals and the Qur'an, Oxford University Press, 2004.

It is majority-owned by General Electric and operated by NRG Energy. Units 1 and 2, rated at 660 MWe, began operation in 1969. Unit 3, rated at 692 MWe nameplate capacity, was launched in 1977. It employs about 260 people, and generates enough electricity to supply two million households. Location The station is located in Center Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania, occupying approximately . The site also includes the Two Lick Reservoir, a water conservation facility which is operated by the station. Coal supply As of 2005, bituminous coal was delivered to the Homer City Generating Station by truck. Units 1 and 2 burned local Pennsylvania coal (that is cleaned on site in a coal cleaning plant) or Western Pennsylvania Pittsburgh seam coal. But now with diminishing local coal and mines to support it, the train track that runs through Indiana University of Pennsylvania has reopened and now supplies are brought in by train. A flue- gas desulfurization unit (scrubber) was added to Unit 3 which allows the unit to burn local coal. History Until its construction in the 1960s by the Pennsylvania Electric Co. (PenElec) and others, much of the property was owned by the George family. In 1969, Units #1 and #2 began operation, while Unit #3 began operating in 1977. In 2001, affiliates of General Electric bought the plant from Edison, and subsequently leased it back to them. In 2011, Edison International failed to secure financing to add pollution-control devices and announced plans to transfer full control to General Electric. On February 29, 2012, Edison took a $1 billion impairment charge related to the Homer City plant and several other coal-fired power plants. At the end of 2012 full control of the plant was transferred back to General Electric, which hired an NRG affiliate to operate it. In early 2017, the plant filed for bankruptcy protection. Water use 200px Boiler water make up, condenser cooling water, and potable water is taken from Two Lick Creek, processed through various pretreatment facilities, used and discharged through various environmental treatment facilities, and returned to Two Lick Creek and Blacklick Creek. From there, the Black Lick enters the Conemaugh River, which goes on to meet the Loyalhanna River, creating the Kiskiminetas River, before entering the Allegheny River. Pollution A scrubber was added in 1998 which reduced mercury output. In 2012, General Electric, through contractors, began construction of anti-pollution control equipment known as \\"scrubbers\\" to further reduce the plant's emissions. = Sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution= * In 1995, Homer City discharged of SO2. * In 2003, Homer City discharged of SO2 and was ranked SO2 the fourth-largest SO2 polluter in the nation. The scrubbers that the plant is installing will make Homer City one of the nation's cleanest coal-fired power plants. * In 2005, the facility was ranked as the nation's sixth-highest SO2 polluter as it discharged only 119,771 pounds (54.327 metric tons) of SO2 that year. =Selenium in wastewater discharges= In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) fined the owners of the Homer City electricity generating station, EME Homer City Generation LP, $200,000 for violating the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law. The station exceeded its permitted effluent standards for selenium, total suspended solids, and biochemical oxygen demand in its wastewater discharges, and allowed discharges of stormwater associated with its flue-gas desulfurization scrubbers. 200px =Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)= Homer City's three coal boilers installed Selective Catalytic Reduction to reduce ozone-forming NOx emissions in 2000 and 2001. This technology produced up to an 83% reduction in NOx emissions in subsequent years. Since the optimum years of 2005-06, emissions have begun to creep back up towards what they were before the installation of this technology. During the summer of 2012 plant emissions of NOx doubled over the 2005-06 period from 2,300 tons to 4,500 tons, even as electrical generation fell by 30%.\\"Air Markets Program Data\\", USEPA, http://ampd.epa.gov/ampd/ Through this same period, the price of natural gas, which competes with coal as a fuel for electrical generation, fell by some 60%.http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9190us3m.htm Through the 2013 summer ozone season, this trend in rising emission rates continued resulting in over 6,300 tons of NOx emissions in excess of what could have been achieved had the plant operated at its previously demonstrated optimum rates seen in 2005-06. Architectural mention View of the power plant from 444px The plant's Unit 3 has a 371 m (1,217 ft) tall chimney, which was built in 1977. This chimney is currently the third-tallest chimney in the world, the second-tallest in North America, and the tallest in the United States. On clear days, it is possible to spot the chimney from as far south as Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and as far east as Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. The chimney is no longer in use, as the gas flow from Unit 3 has been bypassed through a newer flue gas treatment system installed in 2002.

During the Kennett Government, there was media criticism that the Government was reversing some of the transparency provisions introduced over the previous decades including the Freedom of Information and the Audit Act. Within the Government, young MPs like Steve Elder, Robert Doyle and Perton were seen as \\"small-l liberal\\" voices against controversial changes to the Auditor General's Act and the Freedom of Information Act. =Opposition= In 1999, after the defeat of the Kennett government, Perton became Shadow Minister for Conservation and Environment and Shadow Minister for Multimedia (later retitiled \\"Shadow Minister for Technology & Innovation.\\" Perton performed well in these positions, and in August 2002, when Robert Doyle (Napthine's successor as leader) embarked on a major reshuffle in a last-ditch bid to boost the party's flagging fortunes before the state election due late that year, he was promoted to Shadow Attorney-General while also holding the positions of Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs, Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Shadow Minister for Technology and Innovation. Doyle's attempt to prevent a landslide defeat failed, and the party suffered the worst loss in its history, with several Shadow Ministers losing their seats, and Perton coming very close to losing his own. In the aftermath of the defeat, Perton was promoted to Shadow Minister of Education. He regularly appeared in the media with vocal criticism of the government, and remained amongst the opposition's most high- profile members. Within the spectrum of Liberal Party thought, Perton is regarded as a \\"small-l liberal\\",Liberals' Top Brass Brace For Party Purge, Ewin Hannan And Gabrielle Costa, The Age, 21 October 1999\\"Libs to cross floor in (Religious Vilification) vote\\", Mathew Murphy, The Age, 4 May 2006 a position more common in the Victorian Liberal Party than the more aggressively right-wing New South Wales branch.

Specifically, Perton reported that Land Victoria and the Department of Justice (DoJ) had \\"conspired to invent a 'survey reform' project to extract $7.5 million from the fund. Land Victoria, a division of DNRE, under direction of O‚ÄôKeeffe, and in collaboration with DoJ, was reported to have attempted to create ‚Äúthe survey project‚Äù to obtain extra government funding through EAGF, despite already having been funded.https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202002/Assembly%20Parlynet%20Extract%2017%20April%202002%20from%20Book%204.pdf The administration of EAGF was under DoJ. Perton reported that O‚ÄôKeeffe's role in what became known as the EAGF scandal also involved successfully obtaining high level political approval for wrongful access to EAGF funds between October and December 2000. This included ‚Äúinvention‚Äù of a $1.5 million ‚Äúfraudulent survey project‚Äù as well as ‚Äúother funds hidden away in smaller applications‚Äù totaling $7.5 million. It was also reported that the survey project proposal was not revealed by O‚ÄôKeeffe to the Surveyor-General of Victoria. Perton reported that efforts by the Surveyor-General Keith Bell to raise his concerns about the attempts to obtain funds inappropriately from EAGF through his office resulted in the Surveyor-General being threatened and intimidated by O'Keeffe. https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202002/Assembly%20Autumn%20Parlynet%20Weekly%20Book%204%202002.pdf Perton, in April 2002 in Parliament and earlier in the media, quoted \\"from documents from 2001 in which the assistant director of land records and information services, Ivan Powell, talks of having 'invented some benefits' in regard to the project and of a request to 'invent another layer of detail'. Powell was a senior Land Registry official (under Land Victoria). It was later reported that the Surveyor-General had earlier reported his concerns to the Auditor-General who stepped to prevent it from proceeding. The Surveyor- General also reported his concerns to the Ombudsman. https://www.theage.com.au/national/7m-project-invented-20020418-gdu4xb.html Perton reported to the Parliament that O‚ÄôKeeffe was acting with the full support of the responsible Minister, Sherryl Garbutt. Garbutt, the Minister for Conservation and Environment, to which Land Victoria was accountable. Further, Perton reported that investigations by the Auditor-General and by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) were not willingly assisted by O‚ÄôKeeffe and Land Victoria. Requests for information and assistance by Deloitte's were blocked by Land Victoria. Perton reported that on 31 May 2001, Deloitte requested information from Land Victoria. In response, O‚ÄôKeeffe's subordinate, John Hartigan, Director of the Land Registry (under Land Victoria) directed all staff to not comply with any request for information from Deloitte. Perton reported that the Surveyor-Generak initially raised his concerns of the proposal to obtain funds from EAGF on 7 March, 2001 with O'Keeffe. The Surveyor-General's concerns were dismissed by O‚ÄôKeeffe who ‚Äúresponded in threatening terms‚Äù that he was accountable to Garbutt and the Secretary through O‚ÄôKeeffe and Hartigan. The Secretary was Chloe Munro. A subsequent investigation by the State Ombudsman, ‚ÄúA conspiracy between members of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment and of the Department of Justice to defraud the Estate Agents Guarantee Fund‚Äù found the attempt represented a conflict of interest and was not ethical. The Ombudsman reported that on 17 April 2002, during the Grievances Debate in the Legislative Assembly of the State Parliament, Perton raised allegations of a conspiracy to defraud the EAGF and that senior officers of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) were implicated in this matter. The Ombudsman advised that subsequently two whistle-blowers had come forward to his office which led to his investigation in accordance with ‚Äòpublic interest disclosures‚Äô under section 50 the Whistle- blowers Protection Act 2001 and launched on 19 June 2002. The Ombudsman found that the \\"projectising\\" of the survey function was little more than a scheme to obtain additional funding, despite already being appropriated. It was reported by the Ombudsman that senior officers of DNRE attempted to cajole the Surveyor-General to take responsibility for the invented project, which he rightfully declined. The Ombudsman concluded in his April 2003 Report: ‚ÄúFinally, the allegations that arose when this matter was placed under scrutiny ought to stand as a warning to those entrusted with determining the eligibility of applicants and/or programmes for funding from the various Statutory Trust Funds.‚Äù https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL2003-06No12.pdf Perton also reported to the Parliament that this was not the first attempt by Land Victoria to illegally obtain funds from the EAGF. The Auditor-General had prevented an earlier attempt by O‚ÄôKeeffe-led Land Victoria and the Department of Justice to ‚Äúraid the EAGF of $45 million\\". =Raising Concerns of Political Interference in the Performance of the Surveyor-General's Responsibilities= Perton frequently raised concerns regarding O‚ÄôKeeffe's performance as the Executive Director of Land Victoria especially on matters of governance and accountability during the period 2001-02. She was especially cited for her interference with, including threats and intimidation of, the Surveyor-General in the performance of his responsibilities. Such interference included: attempts to block or alter annual Surveyor-General reports; hiring of private investigators to investigate the Surveyor-General and his office; the contracting of the ASIBA lobbyist to discredit the Surveyor-General; and efforts to interfere with the Surveyor-General's review of State electoral boundaries in his capacity as an Electoral Boundaries Commissioner. Over the period 2001-04, Perton and other members of the Opposition including David Davis and Ted Baillieu continued to raise concerns in the interference in the performance of the Surveyor-General's responsibilities at both senior department officials and the responsible Ministers. The Age, Herald Sun and ABC carried numerous reports of such interference especially as it was frequently raised by the Opposition in both Houses of the Parliament of Victoria and reported in Hansard. Such public reporting continued well after O‚ÄôKeeffe departed Land Victoria in August 2002 and even after Bell resigned his appointment as Surveyor-General of Victoria in July 2003 and joined the World Bank. Given the investigations and findings reported by key \\"watchdogs\\", including the Ombudsman and Auditor-General, as well as the reported advice of the Victorian Government Solicitor, Perton and his Opposition colleagues had rightly continued to raise concerns that may otherwise have not come to public attention. https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202004/Assembly%20Autumn%20Weekly%20Book%206%202004.pdf  After politics  After Perton left politics he became an independent Company Director and practiced as a barrister. He remained active in supporting democracy movements in Asia.http://www.hku.hk/ccpl/events/otherevents/documents/Programme- PoliticalParties-13Dec06.pdf In December 2008 Victorian Premier John Brumby announced Perton's appointment as Victorian Government Commissioner to the Americas, based in San Francisco.http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/premier/new- trade-commissioners-to-help-boost-victorian-economy.html His other appointments include to the Transport Accident Commission, the Federal Government's Council on Australia-Latin America Relations, the Global Integrity Summit and the Australian Centre for Financial Studies.

It is used by over half of Kenya's estimated 600,000 deaf population. There are some dialect differences between Kisumu (western Kenya), Mombasa (eastern Kenya) and Somalia. (See Somali Sign Language.) Language situation As well as Kenyan Sign Language, a number of other languages have been used for instruction in Kenya: Belgian Sign Language (in one school only), British Sign Language (in one school only), American Sign Language,Gallaudet world FAQ KIE Signed English, and even Korean Sign Language.Ethnologue report It is probable that students in these schools use a form of KSL regardless. A manual alphabet exists mainly from the American Sign Language manual alphabet. However the British manual alphabet was used in the early years. Status and recognition KSL currently has no legal status, but there is a proposal that Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) and Braille should be recognized in the country's new constitution as national and official Languages alongside English and Swahili. Interpreters are rarely available, and usually 'unqualified' uncertified due to the lack of a training program/certification process. Kenya Sign Language Interpreters Association Kenya Sign Language Interpreters Association was set up by a group of 20 local interpreters after a training by the first Deaf Education US Peace Corps Volunteers in September 2000. Prior to this training there were several short term trainings conducted by KSLRP/KNAD dating back to 1980s and 1990s. [KSLIA] is an indigenous initiative evolving and strengthening the face of the Interpreting profession in Kenya. [KSLIA] hopes to improve and elevate the standards of Interpreting in Kenya through the following objectives: a)To secure official recognition by the Government of S.L Interpreters profession b)Encourage and promote initiatives in improving the standards of SL interpreting and interpreter training and pay scale of interpreters depending with their level and skills of interpretation through certification. c)Cooperation with other recognized bodies concerned in the welfare of the deaf and in provision of S.L Interpreters throughout the world. d)Awareness creation on Deafness and SL. Interpreters through publication of information materials e)To collect and raise funds for the achievement of goals and objectives through membership fee, subscription, contribution, gifts or donations, commissions and payments, fund raising whether in money or otherwise from both members and non members. f)To maintain and administer a registry of S.L Interpreters in Kenya, enforce a code of ethics and mediate conflict between the Interpreters and their clients. KSLIA is working towards the establishment of a training program and a certification process for its membership. [KSLIA] envisions its role in a three pronged approach - the three C's - Certification of members, Continuing education for the practicing Interpreters and Conflict resolution through enforcement of the Code of Ethics. Global Deaf Connection, Deaf Aid, and KSLIA have jointly organized a series of trainings aimed at developing a process to provide training, certification and continued professional development for Kenyan Interpreters. Dictionaries and Education A Kenyan Sign Language dictionary was published in 1991. KSLRP working with Peace Corp Volunteers have recently developed an interactive digital dictionary ([KSL Interactive]) A new online dictionary and mobile application have been published at www.ksldictionary.com since the year 2014. ([KSL Dictionary] KSL is not generally used in the classrooms of Kenya's 35 residential boarding schools for deaf students, despite it being their main language, and reportedly literacy in English and Swahili is very low among the deaf community. Since the first deaf schools were established in the 1960s, the teaching staff rarely (if ever) included a deaf person, until a government program in the 1990s (spearheaded by the Kenya National Association of the Deaf) saw two deaf individuals trained and employed as teachers. However, the program is now continued by Global Deaf Connection chaired by Nickson Kakiri. It is based at Machakos Teachers College. Sign language organizations The Kenya National Association of the Deaf (KNAD) is a national non-governmental organisation formed and managed by Deaf people. It was established in 1986 and registered in 1987 under the Societies Act; KNAD is also an ordinary member of the World Federation of the Deaf. The Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association (KSLIA) is a national, non governmental, Society formed and managed by Kenyan Interpreters to promote the development of the Interpreting profession in Kenya and to provide quality Interpretation services for Deaf Kenyans. It was established in September 2000. KSLIA is working on becoming a member of WASLI World Association of Sign Language Interpreters. Sign Bilingual Schools Humble Hearts School in Nairobi, Kisii School for the Deaf and Kenya Christian School for the Deaf at Oyugis use KSL as the language of instruction. Humble Hearts School is Kenya's first sign bilingual school where KSL and English are taught on an equal par. Kedowa School for the Deaf in Kericho District also uses KSL for instruction, and is unique among Deaf schools in Kenya in that more than half of the teachers at the school are Deaf themselves.

First making a cameo during the final scenes of the 2004 title Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and full appearance in Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas is a \\"Nobody\\", who was created from the series' main character Sora who briefly loses his heart during the first game of the series. Kingdom Hearts II reveals that Roxas is a member of Organization XIII, a group of Nobodies who need him as he can wield the Keyblade, a weapon that allows him to capture hearts. As a member of the organization, Roxas bears the title . He is also the protagonist of the video game Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, which revolves around his origins. In the Japanese games, Roxas is voiced by K≈çki Uchiyama, while Jesse McCartney takes the role in the English versions. Since his cameo appearance, director Tetsuya Nomura has said that Roxas is an important character in the series, and in order to explain his back story in more detail than was done in Kingdom Hearts II, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was created. Since his introduction in Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas has received positive critical response from video game publications with most of them focusing on his development in 358/2 Days. Various types of merchandise based on his character has been produced. Characteristics Roxas is depicted as a spiky blond- haired boy with blue eyes. Due to his nature as a Nobody, he is an \\"empty shell\\" of series' protagonist Sora created when the latter sacrifices his heart and becomes a Heartless during the events of Kingdom Hearts. As a result, despite his teenage appearance, Roxas is one day short of a year old when he rejoins Sora in Kingdom Hearts II. As a civilian, he wears a white jacket over a black one and white trousers. As a member of Organization XIII, Roxas wears a hooded black coat that covers most of his body. His weapon is the Keyblade known as , resembling a classic skeleton key with a long silver keychain extending from the hilt, and a Mickey Mouse token on the end of it. However, the player can modify it during Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days using the game's panel system. Roxas also becomes able to dual-wield Keyblades after leaving the Organization, and exclusively uses the weapon's and forms for each. Roxas' personality changes significantly across the series due to the fact that when first introduced, he appears with fake memories that make him believe he is a common teenager, and spends most of his time with his friends. After learning that he is Sora's Nobody, and remembering his past, Roxas gives up his existence so that Sora can continue to exist, but still expresses happiness for his fate. During his time in the Organization, Roxas develops a calm personality as a result of having no memories of a previous life, unlike other Nobodies. Appearances Roxas' first appearances were cameos in Another Side, Another Story, a bonus trailer found in Kingdom Hearts, and in the ending of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. In Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas is introduced as a boy living in a computer simulation of a city called Twilight Town. Unaware of the virtual nature of the city, Roxas begins to dream about the adventures of Sora, the series' protagonist. He later encounters Axel, a member of Organization XIII who is under orders to extract him, and Namin√©, a Nobody who tells him he is Sora's other half. Shortly after meeting DiZ, the creator of the virtual world, Roxas learns the true nature of Twilight Town, and that DiZ altered his memory and personality to mislead his pursuers from the Organization until he can merge with Sora. DiZ leads Roxas to an old mansion where he rejoins a sleeping Sora, allowing him to wake up. Sora later learns that Roxas is his Nobody, created during the events of the first game after briefly turning into a Heartless, and inducted into the Organization for his ability to capture hearts with the Keyblade; however, Roxas later betrayed the Organization and encountered one of Sora's friends, Riku, who captured him to restore Sora. Roxas makes two appearances near the end of the game: the first is in a mental battle with Sora depicted as a cut- scene, and the second is with Namin√©, who has merged with her other self, Kairi. In the re-released version of the title, Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, Roxas' fight against Sora is expanded, making him a boss character. The battle was meant to be interactive in Kingdom Hearts II, but time constraints imposed from creating fights for the other Organization XIII members prevented its inclusion. With the opportunity to include the fight, Nomura's team worked hard to make it entertaining for players. Additional scenes about Roxas' past were included in the game to add to the mystery around him. Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, a prequel to Kingdom Hearts II, reveals Roxas' life with Organization XIII. Unlike the other Organization members, he lacks memories of his previous life. During Roxas' time in the Organization, he is placed under Axel's watch, and the two become friends. After Axel is sent to Castle Oblivion, Roxas is partnered with Xion, the Organization's 14th member and another Keyblade wielder, whom he befriends. Roxas reacts to Sora's memory restoration and starts questioning why he uses the Keyblade, doubting the Organization's motives. When he discovers that Xion is a replica created by Xemnas from Sora's memories, Roxas is compelled to defect from Organization XIII to find answers and meet Sora. After doing so, he encounters Xion, who has been repurposed by Xemnas to absorb him so that she can become a complete replica; however, the fight ends with Xion's defeat, and she entrusts Roxas with freeing the hearts captured by the Organization. On his way to face Xemnas, Roxas is confronted by Riku, who knocks him unconscious in order to help DiZ and Namin√© wake Sora. A virtual representation of Roxas appears as a boss character in the mobile phone game Kingdom Hearts Coded, in which he confronts a virtual representation of Sora; he later appears in the ending as one of the people connected to Sora's heart who may have a chance at returning one day. He makes a cameo appearance at the end of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, where he is shown with Xion and Axel eating sea-salt ice cream in Twilight Town, as well as in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, where Roxas contacts both Axel and Sora through dreams. He also appears in Shiro Amano's manga and Tomoko Kanemaki's novels, where he reprises his role from the video games. The book Kingdom Hearts: Another Report includes a novel called Roxas‚ÄìSomewhere in Time that retells Roxas' days in the Organization with the exception of his befriending Xion. In Kingdom Hearts III, as Sora tries to stop the revived Xion from killing Lea, Roxas says her name through Sora, making Xion stop. Roxas is revived by Ienzo, Vexen, and Demyx through Vexen's Replica Program just in time to save Xion from being killed by Xemnas in the Keyblade Graveyard. He fights alongside Sora and Xion in Lea's place to defeat Sa√Øx. Then he joins the other guardians of light in defeating Master Xehanort and closing Kingdom Hearts, after which he and Xion join Lea on the Twilight Town clock tower. They are joined by Isa (formerly Sa√Øx), Hayner, Pence, and Olette, and they all eat ice cream together. Then they're brought to Destiny Islands to celebrate their victory with the others, where Roxas races with Riku and Terra on the beach. Creation and development After Roxas first cameo at the end of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, the series' director, Tetsuya Nomura, was questioned about the character. However, he refrained from revealing too much detail about him and said he would become an important, playable character for the franchise. The developers wrote Roxas' story in Kingdom Hearts II to add mixed feelings to the game in a short time frame. After receiving a positive fan response to Roxas' sad scenario, Nomura concluded that it was well executed. He also stated that Roxas' merging with Sora in the game was one of the most memorable scenes from the series for him. Nomura later commented that Roxas was one of the first characters created for Organization XIII, and was always intended to be the 13th member. The meaning of Roxas' name was meant to be revealed in a scene in Kingdom Hearts II that shows the letters in the word \\"Sora\\" rearranged with the \\"X\\" added to expand the connection between the characters. However, this scene was omitted as Nomura found it difficult to implement time-wise. Since his debut in Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas has been voiced in Japanese by K≈çki Uchiyama and by Jesse McCartney in the English versions. After Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was released, Nomura wanted to expand Roxas' role in the series to explain the events between his birth and his disappearance from Organization XIII. For Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the staff thought that Roxas' role as a member of the group would be a suitable theme for the plot. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. Co-director Tomohiro Hasegawa explained that Roxas' was originally shorter, and the staff decided he should grow taller as the game continued to develop. Nomura wanted to portray Roxas' activities differently from Sora's. In Sora's games, he is on a journey around the world, while Roxas always returns to Organization XIII after each mission. The staff constructed Roxas' interactions with the Disney characters differently from Sora's, as the Organization was meant to be secret in the game's story. Nomura told the writers that he wanted Roxas to learn something from each of his missions or just to have something to think about. Nomura later clarified that Roxas' personality was different from the one portrayed in Kingdom Hearts II, as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters. With Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Nomura wanted to reveal why Roxas left Organization XIII. Although Nomura found it a sad story, he considered Zack Fair's ending in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII to be more tragic. Nomura felt Roxas' last words in the game were also the title's most significant, as he wanted them to connect to Kingdom Hearts IIs first scene, which is actually the same scene. Uchiyama expressed sadness when the game's development ended as he would not play the character for a long time. Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending features a character named Ventus who bears a strong striking resemblance to him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus are not the same character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be explained by the fact that the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one. Reception Jesse McCartney is the voice of Roxas in the English version of the series. Roxas has been featured in various types of merchandise produced by Square Enix. An action figure was released as part of the Play Arts action figures series; Other items include a plush, keychains and replicas of his necklace. Roxas' character has received a positive critical response from both fans and video game publications. During February 2010, Roxas was twenty-eighth in a Famitsu poll featuring the most popular video game characters from Japan. In another poll, Roxas was voted the second most popular Kingdom Hearts character with his fight against Sora ranked as the best scene from the series. His fighting sequences from the first game's secret ending were called one of the best video game cinematic moments by GameSpy. While reviewing Kingdom Hearts II Jeff Haynes of IGN said that Roxas was a \\"likable kid\\". Ron Fahey of Eurogamer had a similar view, calling him a \\"likeable enough young chap who just happens to be troubled by memories and visions of people he doesn't even know\\". His playable position in the game was regarded as a transitional arc, being used to introduce the gameplay to players who are new to the franchise. Cavin Smith of PSX Extreme also called Roxas a likable character and stated that the revelation regarding his existence in Kingdom Hearts II is \\"a shocker of a revelation for any RPG!\\" The New York Times liked the fact that the player controls Roxas in Kingdom Hearts IIs introduction instead of the protagonist Sora, avoiding the continuation of Sora's search for his friends. Additionally, the reviewer found the switch from Roxas' story to Sora's after a few hours \\"a little jarring\\". Andrew Reiner from Game Informer emphasizes his role as a \\"troubled boy,\\" calling his story arc \\"an amazing chain of events,\\" particularly noting that the revelation of his nature as a Nobody creates a \\"devilish yet remarkable plot twist\\" which may impact the player in a way that he \\"may not want Sora back\\". On the other hand, UGO Networks commented that due to the game's initial focus on Roxas, gamers would have to wait until playing as Sora to experience the most exciting parts of the title. Before Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was released, 1UP.com featured Roxas at the top of their \\"Why You Should Care About Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\\" feature, calling him \\"The darling of fanfiction and doujinshi writers everywhere,\\" and commenting on what he does during his only year within Organization XIII. Roxas' role as protagonist was described by G4TV as an attempt to \\"satiate the ravenous fanboy\\" due to the explanation from his background. While reviewing 358/2 Days, PALGN's Adam Ghiggino praised Roxas' development saying that even gamers who did not like his character in Kingdom Hearts II would care about him as \\"he evolves from a self-described 'zombie' to a strong-willed and interesting character\\". Ghiggino especially noted his relationship with Xion and Axel, which he found charming despite the fact that they repeatedly meet at the top of a clock tower in many scenes. A similar response appeared in Game Informer, which commented that although such scenes were \\"dull\\", Roxas' relation with Xion and Axel was appealing and the game's ending would make up for such moments. GamesRadar also commented that Roxas \\"starts off like a zombie, but rapidly develops a personality\\" during the title and joked about the numerous times he eats ice cream. His growth during the game was also picked as one of the most enjoyable elements of the title. IGN agreed, calling Roxas' friendship \\"heart-aching\\". On the other hand, 1UP.com mentioned that although Roxas' relationship with Xion and Axel is appealing, some of his first missions feel like \\"lonely, sad affairs\\". His maneuvers in the game were praised by GameSpot for being easy to learn despite how complex they look, while IGN liked the variation between them. Due to his resemblance to Ventus, video game publications initially thought that Roxas would be one of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications still discussed how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that in Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas.

Biography  Coat of Arms of the Counts of Nassau from the Walramian branch Walram was the second son of Count Henry II of Nassau and Matilda of Guelders and Zutphen,Vorsterman van Oyen (1882). the youngest daughter of Count Otto I of Guelders and Zutphen and Richardis of Bavaria (herself daughter of Otto I Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria). Walram is first mentioned in a charter dated 20 July 1245. Walram succeeded his father before 1251, together with his brother Otto I.Becker (1983), p. 11.Huberty, et al. (1981). They received town privileges for Herborn from the German King William in 1251. Walram and Otto divided their county on 16 December 1255 with the river Lahn as border. The division treaty is nowadays known as the Prima divisio. The area south of the Lahn: the lordships Wiesbaden, Idstein, the √Ñmter Weilburg (with the Wehrholz) and Bleidenstadt, was assigned to Walram. Nassau Castle and dependencies (Dreiherrische),Castle and Amt Nassau bore the name Dreiherrische because until 1778 it was jointly owned by the Ottonian branch and two sub-branches of the Walramian branch (Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg). See: Huberty, et al. (1981). the √Ñmter Miehlen and Sch√∂nau (Sch√∂nau Abbey near Str√ºth √ºber Nast√§tten)The √Ñmter of Miehlen and Sch√∂nau remained jointly owned until 1303, after which they were transferred to the Walramian branch and both sub- branches owned them jointly until 1778. See: Huberty, et al.

In 1774 these areas, around the city of Nast√§tten and composed of thirty-eight villages, were divided. See: Huberty, et al. (1981). Laurenburg Castle, the Esterau (which was jointly owned with the counts of Diez) and the fiefs in Hesse remained jointly owned. Later, perhaps shortly after the conclusion of the division treaty, Walram expressed dissatisfaction with some provisions of the treaty and challenged them. Whether he was already acting under the influence of the mental illness from which he suffered is unknown. What is certain is that in an attack of insanity he burned his copy of the division treaty.Sauer (1896). Walram was Hofmarschall and Geheimrat of King Rudolf I of Germany. Walram lost several towns, including Niederlahnstein, Pfaffenhofen and Vallendar, to the Archbishop of Trier. He also continued the Dernbacher Feud against Hesse. He died ‚Äì allegedly in mental derangement ‚Äì on 24 January 1276. He was succeeded by his son Adolf.  Marriage and children  Walram married before 1250 to Adelheid of Katzenelnbogen (‚Ä† Mainz, 22 February 1288), daughter of Count Diether IV of Katzenelnbogen and Hildegunde. As a widow Adelheid was a Clarissan nun in Wiesbaden (in the summer) and in Mainz (in the winter). She was buried in the St. Clara monastery in Mainz.

The Fiji Law Society condemned the military coup which deposed the government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase on 5 December 2006. Fiji Times and Fiji Village reported on 9 December that the society had barred seven military lawyers from practicing, and warned any lawyers against accepting the positions of Attorney-General or Solicitor-General in the interim government. After an interim government was announced on 5‚Äì9 January 2007, the Society recognized its reality, but not its legality. The Society condemned what it saw as interference in the Judiciary by the military-backed government, after Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki and Chief Magistrate Naomi Matanitobua were sent on forced leave on 3 January 2007, and Anthony Gates sworn in as Acting Chief Justice on 16 January. Not all members of the Society supported its stance against the interim government. Rajendra Chaudhry, son of former Mahendra Chaudhry, a former Prime Minister and the first Minister for Finance in the interim administration, spoke out on 24 January 2007, objecting to what he saw as personal opinions held by Sharma and Draunidalo being presented as official positions of the Fiji Law Society - without consulting its members, many of whom shared his concerns, he claimed. He called for a special meeting to deal with the issue, and threatened to join a breakaway body if his grievances were not addressed. The next day, Draunidalo announced that Sharma had ordered such a meeting, in order to \\"crush\\" internal opposition to its anti-coup stance.

The FHRC was seeing an injunction to allow Colonel Mohammed Aziz, the Military's Director of Legal Services, and one other Military lawyer to resume practice. Aziz said the suspension made it impossible for him and his fellow-military lawyers to represent their clients, and that the decision was biased because he and the FLS President were opposing counsel in an upcoming trial.

He was one of a small group of Southern newspaper editors who campaigned for civil rights for African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s. Baggs became an early opponent of the Vietnam War. Early life and education William Calhoun Baggs, called \\"Bill\\", was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and grew up in Colquitt, Georgia in Miller County near the Georgia-Alabama border. He attended Miller County High School, which was still racially segregated at the time. There, he edited the school newspaper and lettered in numerous sports. His classmates voted him valedictorian of the 1941 graduating class. He turned down an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy and, instead, moved to the Panama Canal Zone with his sister and brother-in- law. Career Baggs started work in journalism as a reporter for the Panama Star and Herald. In 1942, he volunteered for the U.S. Army Air Force and served with the 485th Heavy Bomb Group (830th Squadron) of the Fifteenth Air Force in Venosa, Italy. As a bombardier, he earned a Distinguished Flying Cross and a Unit Citation. During a period of rest and reassignment in Miami Beach, Florida, he fell in love with the growing city of Miami as well as a Red Cross Recreational Assistant named Joan Orr, who later would become his wife. He worked briefly as a cub reporter in Greensboro, N.C., before returning to Miami as the aviation reporter for the Miami News. He was named a columnist in December 1949, and distinguished himself for taking progressive stands on civil rights, economic investment in Latin America to combat the rise of communism, and preserving the environment. As a columnist, he traveled extensively in Latin America and Europe and throughout the United States. He built strong friendships with world leaders as well as high-ranking politicians, such as Adlai Stephenson, and brothers John F. and Robert Kennedy. In July 1957, publisher James M. Cox Jr. named Baggs editor of the Miami News. He held that position until his death at age 45 on January 7, 1969. Latin America During his tenure, his newspaper had a front seat to the Cuban Revolution, Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. His friendship with President Kennedy gave him advanced knowledge of the Soviet Union's buildup of missile launch sites on the island. Later, though, when he was asked by a Time magazine reporter how his newspaper scooped both the announcement as well as the turning back of Soviet ships, Baggs answered, \\"A roseate spoonbill told us.\\" An active anti-Communist, Baggs published numerous anti-Castro editorials and articles during the early days of the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba, beginning in 1959. Baggs cultivated numerous news sources from within the anti-Castro Soldier-of-Fortune community in South Florida, including Gerry Patrick Hemming, Roy Hargraves, Eddie Collins and William Whatley, as well as Alex Rorke and several others. He also worked with Frank Sturgis and Bernard Barker to develop news leads and sources about the South Florida anti-Castro exile community long before they were involved with the 1970s Watergate scandal. Baggs regularly talked with South Florida CIA case officers, such as David Atlee Phillips and E. Howard Hunt, on various topics related to the intrigues among South Florida anti-Castro Cuban exiles. One of his reporters, Hal Hendrix, known as \\"the spook\\" at The Miami News, broke the story about the alleged coup d'√©tat against Juan Bosch of the Dominican Republic, the day before it happened. This was embarrassing for the CIA and Miami News, but also for Hendrix. Civil Rights As African Americans increased their activism in the civil rights movement, Baggs was among a small group of white Southern editors who supported them and covered events in the South. Others in this group included Ralph McGill at The Atlanta Constitution, Hodding Carter at the Greenville Delta Democrat-Times, and Harry Ashmore at the Arkansas Gazette.Roberts, Eugene L. \\"Civil Rights Era Editors\\", American Society of Newspaper Editors - URL retrieved June 25, 2006\\"Ralph McGill (1898-1969)\\", The New Georgia Encyclopedia], retrieved June 25, 2006 In the 1960s, Baggs became increasingly opposed to the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1967 and 1968 he traveled to North Vietnam with Harry Ashmore, editor of the Arkansas Gazette, on a private peace mission. While there, they interviewed the North Vietnamese premier, Ho Chi Minh, about what he needed to end the war.U.S. Department of State: Foreign Relations, 1964-1968, Volume V, Vietnam 1967, Marigold, Sunflower, and the Continuing Search for Peace, January‚ÄìFebruary, Document 20.

He wrote numerous articles and editorials supporting legislation to help the numerous retirees who were already dominating the population in South Florida. They represented the core readership base of the Miami News. He was often criticized for his support of civil rights, opposition to the Vietnam War, and promotion of social welfare programs for the elderly, the infirm and the disadvantaged in South Florida and throughout the nation. Baggs supported early pioneering conservation efforts to rescue the southeast section of Key Biscayne from overdevelopment by real estate developers.

He was released for nine days in February 1942 and allowed to return to Luxembourg, an episode which he later wrote about in his memoirs of the camp and which was turned into a film. Life Born in 1907, the sixth of ten children, into the family of a Luxembourg businessman, he attended the Ath√©n√©e de Luxembourg until 1925, then studied at the university of Louvain in Belgium and then studied theology and philosophy at the Catholic seminary in Luxembourg. He was awarded a doctorate in philosophy in 1933. From 1934, he headed the international Catholic film bureau (OCIC) in Brussels until it was closed down by the Gestapo in June 1940. He then became involved in helping Luxembourg families who had fled to France ahead of the German forces to return to their home country. On 6 January 1941, he was arrested by the German occupation forces as a symbol of Luxembourg Catholic resistance to German occupation; that May he was sent to Dachau. In February 1942, he was unexpectedly released for nine days. He believed that this was part of a scheme to persuade six Luxembourgish priests to publicly voice their support for the Nazi regime. Bernard refused to cooperate, and was sent back to Dachau. Apparently, intervention by his brother with senior Nazi officials in Paris secured his definitive release on 5 August 1942. Until September 1944, when Luxembourg was liberated, Bernard lived in a monastery. After the war, he served as the editor of the Luxemburger Wort, held senior positions in the Catholic Church in Luxembourg, and received many awards. From 1945 to 1946 he described his experiences in a series of articles in the Wort, under the title Dachau. Aus dem Tagebuch eines Str√§flings,Luxemburger Wort. 19 May 1945 to 4 June 1946. and later in the book Pfarrerblock 25487. The book was the basis for Volker Schl√∂ndorff's film The Ninth Day (Der neunte Tag), released in November 2004, about his nine-day release from Dachau. From 1947 to 1970, Bernard was president of OCIC (which later became SIGNIS). In 1955 he was appointed honorary canon of the cathedral in Luxembourg. In 1958 he retired as editor due to health reasons, but continued to work at the newspaper. In 1970, Bernard was appointed an honorary prelate by Pope Paul VI. He was a member of the papal commission for film, radio and television; for the Second Vatican Council, he was a member of the working group on the press, film, radio and television, and was president of the Commission for the persecuted church, within the International Catholic Organisations Conference.

Alexandria port consists of two harbours (East and West) separated by a T-shaped peninsula. The East harbour is shallow and is not navigable by large vessels. The West harbour is used for commercial shipping. The harbour is formed by two converging breakwaters.  History  = Ancient times = Alexandria Port is one of the oldest ports in the world. The earliest port facilities were built in 1900 BC in the then-village of Rhakotis, to service coastal shipping and supply the island of Pharos (now part of the \\"Ras al-Tin\\" quarter). Plan of Alexandria c. 30 BC Over the centuries sand and silt deposits made the port unnavigable. It was cleared by forces under the command of Alexander the Great in 331 BC as part of the construction of Alexandria city to be the marine base for his fleet. Alexander's engineer Dinocrat linked the port of Alexandria and the island of Pharos with a bridge 1200 meters long and 200 meters wide, creating two harbour basins for commercial and military shipping. The northeast basin (Portus Magnus, currently the Eastern harbour) was designed for military vessels and the southwest basin (Portus Eunostus, currently the main port of Alexandria) was for commercial use. In the Ptolemy era a second bridge was built to Pharos, further dividing the eastern harbour into two separate inlets. According to Strabo, Alexandria had an inland harbour on Lake Mareotis as well as the harbours on the Mediterranean. The lake had no mouth connecting it to the sea but was instead connected to the Nile by canals. Strabo describes the lake harbour as being busier than the harbours on the sea. During the period of Roman Egypt, grain was exported in large quantities from the city's Western Harbour, earning it the name \\"Portus Magnus\\". The grain was brought down the Nile by barge and stored in large granaries near the shore of Lake Mareotis before shipping. At the height of the Roman Empire, Alexandria was shipping 83,000 tons of grain per year to Rome. By the time of the late Empire, the city was shipping 220,000 tons of grain per year to Constantinople. = Modern era = Muhammad Ali of Egypt issued the order to restore and partly retrace the freshwater canal from the Nile upon his ascension to power. On its completion in 1820 it was named the Mahmoudiyah Canal. Under Muhammad Ali's rule, Alexandria shipyard was founded. During World War I, the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force that took part in the Gallipoli Campaign used the established port of Alexandria as its main base for troops and supplies bound for the landing at Cape Helles. By the late 20th century sea trade through the Port of Alexandria was exceeding its capacity. A new port was built at El-Dekheila during the 1980s with facilities for container shipping and infrastructure to serve the nearby steel factory. In addition to the Port of Dekheila and the Western Port of Alexandria, the city's ports include those at Abu Qir and Sidi Krer, as well as Alexandria's old Eastern Port which is no longer used for shipping freight. The Alexandria Shipyard was originally developed in the 1960s with assistance of the government of the Soviet Union and in 2004 the shipyard ownership was transferred to the Ministry of Defense Egypt has a total of 15 commercial ports along the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts. Alexandria Port, controlled by the Alexandria Port Authority, is the country's largest and it handles approximately 55% of Egypt's international trade. Overall Alexandria's various harbours handle over three quarters of Egypt's foreign trade, with nearly 80% of the country's imports and exports passing through the city.  Geography  The western port is divided into several zones: # Used for general cargo handling. # Deals with four types of activities: unified cargoes including a Ro Ro and passenger terminal, stuffed bulk cargoes, and barge discharge. # Used for handling general cargo and barge discharge. # Used for handling containers, cement, coal, barge discharge, fertilizers, and general cargo. # Used for handling: molasses, timber, some types of general cargoes, barge discharge, grains and flour. # (Oil Dock): Situated at the western boundaries of the port, is used for handling edible oil, oil products and for providing bunkers. It also includes berths used for handling livestock. The port does not include oil storage facilities, but oil berths are connected to a refinery through a 2 km long pipeline.

He played as a left-handed batsman and captained Sussex County Cricket Club. His unusual batting technique attracted a great deal of attention due to a pronounced shuffle from leg to off immediately prior to the bowler releasing the ball. Yardy also bowled slow left arm with a characteristic round armed action, and was used as a bowling all-rounder in England's One Day International and Twenty20 International teams.

Benda family house in Ben√°tky nad Jizerou, built 1706/07, demolished 1936. Life Benda was born in Old Benatek in Bohemia, the son of Jan Ji≈ô√≠ Benda. His brother was the composer Georg Benda. Benda's daughter Juliane Reichardt (1752‚Äì1783) and his granddaughter Louise Reichardt (1779‚Äì1826) were also composers. Benda wrote his autobiography in 1763: it not only gives a detailed account of his own life but also a valuable record of the lives of other musicians whom he encountered during his career. In his youth Benda was a chorister in Prague and afterward in the Chapel Royal at Dresden. At the same time he began to study the violin, and soon joined a company of strolling musicians who attended fetes, fairs, etc. At eighteen years of age Benda abandoned this wandering life and returned to Prague, going to Vienna, where he pursued his study of the violin under Johann Gottlieb Graun, a pupil of Tartini. After two years he was appointed chapel master at Warsaw. In 1732, he entered the service of Frederick the Great, then crown prince of Prussia, with whom he remained the rest of his life. He was a member of the crown prince's orchestra, and later became concertmaster to the king. He played about 50,000 concertos over a period of forty years. At Benda's request, Frederick allowed his parents and siblings to move to Potsdam when, as Protestants, they suffered religious persecution in Bohemia. Benda was a master of all the difficulties of violin playing, and the rapidity of his execution and the mellow sweetness of his highest notes were unequalled. He had many pupils and wrote a number of works, chiefly exercises and studies for the violin. Benda died in the Nowawes, a small colony near Potsdam set up by Frederick the Great to house Protestant refugees fleeing religious persecution in Bohemia. Legacy Descendants of Benda also continue in the same musical line. In the 20th century, Franti≈°ek Benda was a composer of film scores and other works. The Benda Chamber Orchestra, which carries and honours the name of the Benda musical family, was founded in 1956 in √öst√≠ nad Labem, Northern Bohemia (Czech Republic). One of his descendants, Jean Sebastian Benda, acclaimed Swiss pianist, lived in Brazil, having married the pianist Luzia Benda. After his return to Europe, in 1981, along with his wife and children born in Brazil, his family follows the musical tradition of their ancestors. Compositions Benda composed 17 symphonies, numerous concerti and sonatas for violin, and other chamber works.

The team was based in the founder Ambrose O'Brien's hometown of Renfrew, Ontario. History The team's founder, Ambrose O'Brien had played varsity hockey at the University of Toronto, then continued his interest as a team founder and owner, financed by his father's amassed great wealth during the Cobalt silver rush ‚Äìmining magnate Senator M. J. O'Brien.HHOF \\"Legends of Hockey ‚Äî Builders\\", Hockey Hall of Fame. Retrieved April 21, 2018. In 1909, when O'Brien sought to join the new Canadian Hockey Association with his existing Renfrew team in the semi-pro Federal Hockey League, the application was rejected. With fellow rejectee Montreal Wanderers, O'Brien founded the NHA, along with franchises in Cobalt, Haileybury and Montreal. With O'Brien Silver Mine money backing the Creamery Kings, Renfrew iced a powerful team during its first season, with players Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick commanding salaries of $3,000 each, and Cyclone Taylor receiving a record-setting $5,250 for a two-month season. In consequence, the team became widely nicknamed the \\"Millionaires\\" for the over the tops salaries. O'Brien also secured the services of Newsy Lalonde midseason from the Canadiens franchise, and Lalonde would wind up the season as NHA's first scoring champion. Coached by Ottawa Senators legend and future Hall of Famer Alf Smith, Renfrew finished in third place in the 1910 season with an 8-3-1 record. Its second and final season, Renfrew lost Lalonde to the new Montreal Canadiens team, and finished with a less than stellar 8-8 record, with Don Smith and Odie Cleghorn being the leading scorers. Renfrew's final major professional game was a 7-6 victory on March 7, 1911, against the Wanderers. Thereafter, with it being apparent that the small towns such as Renfrew, Cobalt and Haileybury could not support major senior hockey, O'Brien folded the franchise for good.

It was one of the first concepts in radar absorbent material, an aspect of \\"stealth technology\\", used to prevent enemy radar detection of military vehicles. It was first applied to ship radar cross section (RCS) reduction. The Salisbury screen was invented by American engineer Winfield Salisbury in the early 1940s (see patent filing date). The patent was delayed because of wartime security,. Salisbury W. W. June 10, 1952, cited in Munk. Method of Operation Salisbury screens operate on the same principle as optical antireflection coatings used on the surface of camera lenses and glasses to prevent them from reflecting light. The easiest to understand Salisbury screen design consists of three layers: a ground plane which is the metallic surface that needs to be concealed, a lossless dielectric of a precise thickness (a quarter of the wavelength of the radar wave to be absorbed), and a thin glossy screen. #When the radar wave strikes the front surface of the dielectric, it is split into two waves. #One wave is reflected from the glossy surface screen. The second wave passes into the dielectric layer, is reflected from the metal surface, and passes back out of the dielectric into the air. #The extra distance the second wave travels causes it to be 180¬∞ out of phase with the first wave by the time it emerges from the dielectric surface #When the second wave reaches the surface, the two waves combine and cancel each other out due to the phenomenon of interference. Therefore, there is no wave energy reflected back to the radar receiver. To understand the cancellation of the waves requires an understanding of the concept of interference. When two electromagnetic waves that are coherent and are traveling in the same space interact, they combine to form a single resultant wave. If the two waves are \\"in phase\\" so their peaks coincide, they add, and the output intensity is the sum of the two waves' intensities. However, if the two waves are a half-wavelength \\"out of phase\\", so the positive peaks of one wave coincide with the negative peaks of the other, the two waves subtract, and the difference is zero. The thickness of the dielectric is made equal to a quarter of the wavelength (Œª/4) of the expected radar wave. Since the second wave (in step 2.) travels the thickness of the dielectric twice (once going in and once coming out), the extra distance it travels is a half-wavelength (Œª/2). So it is a half wavelength out of phase with the first wave when they combine, and the two waves cancel. Disadvantages There are significant disadvantages to the concept which have limited the use of Salisbury screens. One is that the simple Salisbury design above works well only at a single radar frequency, so the enemy needs only to change its frequency to defeat it. More complicated multilayer Salisbury designs can cover a band of frequencies, but only by increasing the thickness, and at best cover only a fraction of the radar spectrum. Another problem is the thickness of the screen itself. Radar wavelengths range between 10 cm and 1 mm, thus the thickness of the screen (a quarter-wavelength) must be at most 2.5 cm, and multilayer screens are much thicker. Adding this much bulk to the surfaces of aircraft can unacceptably degrade aerodynamic performance. Research is being conducted on ultra thin Salisbury screens using the Sievenpiper HIGP (high impedance ground plane) (source: Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Microwave Opt. Technol.

Daulis (), at a later time Daulia (ŒîŒ±œÖŒªŒØŒ±),, and also Daulium or Daulion (ŒîŒ±œçŒªŒπŒøŒΩ), was a town of ancient Phocis, near the frontiers of Boeotia, and on the road from Orchomenus and Chaeroneia to Delphi. It is said to have derived its name from the woody character of the district, since Œ¥Œ±œçŒªŒøœÇ was used by the inhabitants instead of Œ¥Œ¨ŒªŒøœÇ, while others sought for the origin of the name in the mythical nymph Daulis, a daughter of Cephissus. Daulis is mentioned by Homer as a Phocian town along with Crissa and Panopeus in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad. It is celebrated in mythology as the residence of the Thracian king, Tereus, who married Procne, the daughter of Pandion, king of ancient Athens, and as the scene of those horrible deeds in consequence of which Procne was changed into a swallow, and her sister Philomela into a nightingale. Hence the latter was called by the poets the Daulian bird. The woody district round the town is still a favourite haunt of the nightingale. During the Greco-Persian Wars, Daulis was destroyed by the Persians in the invasion of Xerxes I (580 BCE). Its territory was sacked by the Boeotians, who however were unsuccessful in their attempt to assault the city.Hellenica Oxyrhynchia 21.5. It was destroyed a second time by Philip II of Macedon, at the end of the Third Sacred War (346 BCE); but it was subsequently rebuilt, and is mentioned in later times as a town almost impregnable in consequence of its situation upon a lofty hill.\\"Daulis, quia in tumulo excelso sita est, nec scalis nec operibus capi poterat,\\" In , Daulis was attacked by the Aetolians, like the city of Ambrysus. In 198 BCE, the Romans besieged Daulis but, not being able to take it by direct assault since the city had a very strong position on the top of a hill, they had to occupy it by a stratagem. Pausanias relates that the inhabitants of Daulis were few in number, but surpassed all the other Phocians in stature and strength. The only building in the town mentioned by him was a temple of Athena; but in the neighbourhood he speaks of a district called Tronis, in which was the chapel of a hero (heroon) called the Archegetes. et seq. The name of Daulis is still preserved in that of the modern village of Davleia, situated in a narrow valley, through which flows a branch of the Cephissus (Platania). The walls of the acropolis may be traced on the summit of the height rising opposite the modern village, and connected with the foot of Parnassus by a narrow isthmus. Within the enclosure is an ancient church of St. Theodore. Here an inscription has been found in which mention is made of the worship of Athena Polias and of Serapis. Before the door of the church in the modern village is another ancient inscription, of considerable length, recording an arbitration made at Chaeroneia in the reign of Hadrian, concerning certain property in Daulis. In this inscription we read of \\"a road leading to the Archagetes,\\" which is evidently the chapel of the hero spoken of by Pausanias. One of the plots of land in the inscription is called Platanus, from which probably comes the name of the river Platania. Bishopric Daulis was, at the end of antiquity, the seat of a bishopric. It was created late, perhaps to replace that of Elateia, at a time when the Greeks retreated to the south, due to the Slavic invasion.This see is not mentioned in a list dating from 458. This bishopric was suffragan of Athens. No longer a resident bishop of the Roman Catholic Church, Daulis remains a titular see[http:// www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2d19.html catholic- hierarchy.org].

It is a Vernacular Georgian style building and is reported to be one of the oldest structures in the city of St. John's.  History  The house is of modest construction and an excellent example of 19th-century homes. It was built on land that was purchased from Dr. Jonathan Ogden, a Newfoundland chief justice, in 1802. It was constructed circa 1803-1804, possibly for Sergeant James Anderson. The date is suggested by two notes in the Governor‚Äôs Correspondence, a 1803 permission to build a barn on the property, and a 1804 permission to building a dwelling house. Anderson held land that area at least by 1808, as in September of 1819, the Newfoundland Mercantile Journal gave notice of the public auction of a property lot in the vicinity of the upper part of Maggoty Cove, Signal Hill: \\"The freehold of a field adjoining Lot No, 14, now in the occupancy of Mr. James Anderson, and by him held under a lease, of which 11 years will be unexpired on the 1st November next, at the yearly rent of ¬£7 10.\\" An 1849 map shows the house sitting on what is called \\"Anderson's Ground.\\" Oral history maintains the house was used both as a private residence and as a military barracks with a section of the house used to stable horses. Anderson's military career is not well documented, but multiple newspaper accounts from the era show him to be an entrepreneur, renting and developing properties, selling goods including turnips, carrots, parsnips, firewood, and timothy seed. In 1818, Anderson opened the ‚ÄúSt. Johns‚Äô Spruce Beer Brewery‚Äù at the upper wharf of John Dunscome on the St. John's waterfront. By May 1842 he had expanded his business to include \\"Temperance Liquor\\" including spruce beer and hop porter, sold out of his brewery at Half- way-house, Signal Hill Road, which could have been Anderson‚Äôs circa 1803 barn or one of his other houses. Anderson died on St. Valentine‚Äôs Day, 14 February 1852 at age 84, and was survived by his wife, Catherine. Henry C. Tillmann, a professor of music and a composer who arrived in St. John's in 1844 from Halifax, Nova Scotia, purchased the home from Catherine in 1860. Mary Tillman, wife of Henry, sold the property to John Power some time between 1862 and 1864; in 1878 he in turn sold it to Patrick Power. At some point the property passed from a Mary Power to her husband, William Finlay, who owned the property in 1970. The building was at one time following this owned by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of St. John's.  Restoration and Heritage Designation  After 1972, the building began to decay rapidly. In 1973, it was noted that in spite of a fire a number of years previously, the interior of the building was fairly intact, including a simple spiral staircase and two open fireplaces. In 1976, following a four-year campaign to save the building, the Newfoundland Historic Trust purchased the building and entered into an agreement with The Architect's Guild to restore the building. On 7 October of that year, shortly after the Trust signed the papers to take over the empty building, another fire caused serious damage to the structure. Between 1977-78, much of the building was restored, and an eastern addition (which possibly served as the stable) was removed. The work was primarily directed by Sylvia Cullum and her architect husband Charles Cullum. In 1979, Sylvia wrote, > The east end of the building, which was of a later date, was tom down as it > was felt to be too damaged by fire to be rebuilt, and the house re-emerged > in its original shape.It was made watertight and a roof of wooden shingles > was put on....Wooden siding had to be re- placed and the windows re-glazed > and part of the chimney rebuilt using old bricks from a demolished bank on > Duckworth Street to replace those that were too rotten to re-use. Interior work included plastering, exposing wall boards of rough cut hemlock, sourcing and replacing mouldings, scraping and repainting mantels, researching and painting in historic colours, and completely refurbishing the staircase. Charles Cullum received an inaugural Southcott Award from the Newfoundland Historic Trust for his dedication to the preservation of St. John's over the course of many years, including restoration work on Anderson House. In 1984, it was noted that the building had been preserved \\"as a distinctive set of offices with much of the atmosphere and charm of... earlier times.\\" On March 23, 1996, the Anderson House was designated as a Registered Heritage Structure by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador. A plaque was affixed in 1998. The building was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places February 2, 2005. From circa 2009-2011, the building was occupied by The Bookery, a short-lived independent bookstore. In 2014, the property was home to Innovative Development & Design Engineers, Ltd., an engineering consulting company, and then owner Hubert Alacoque was presented the Southcott Award for architectural preservation. On 27 January 2017, the building was designated as a Heritage Building by the St. John's Municipal Council.

Its network spans 50 markets in 17 countries, with more than 8,500 branches and over 97,775 employees. Its strategic position in Western and Eastern Europe gives the group one of the continent's highest market shares.  History  = Founding through mergers and growth (1998‚Äì2006) = UniCredit Group was the outcome of the 1998 merger of several Italian banking groups, which the majority one were Unicredito (banks from Turin, Verona and Treviso) and Credito Italiano (consists of Rolo Banca, Banca Popolare di Rieti), hence the name Unicredito Italiano. Credito Italiano issued about 38.46% new shares to the owners of Unicredito, and renamed itself to Unicredito Italiano. Other banks such as Banca dell'Umbria, Cassa di Risparmio di Carpi, Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto (Caritro), Cassa di Risparmio di Trieste also joined the group in 1998‚Äì2000. A new subsidiary was also created in December 1999 which was named after the original Credito Italiano. In 1999, UniCredito Italiano, as it was then known, began its expansion in Eastern Europe with the acquisition of Polish company Bank Pekao. On 30 June 2002, UniCredit started its S3 project which merged 7 of their bank network: Rolo Banca, Banca CRT, Cariverona Banca, Cassamarca, Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto and Cassa di Risparmio di Trieste into Credito Italiano, and Credito Italiano was renamed into UniCredit Banca. UniCredit Private Banking and UniCredit Banca d'Impresa was spin off from it in 2003. In 2005, UniCredit merged with the German group HypoVereinsbank (HVB), which is itself formed in 1998 by the combination of two Bavarian banks: Bayerische Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank. Integration with the HVB Group was reinforced by the merger with Bank Austria Creditanstalt in the year 2000 and enabled further growth for the UniCredit Group. Additionally, Bank Austria Creditanstalt was a major shareholder in Bank Medici AG. Bank Medici was Thema Fund's investment manager. In return for finding investors, Bank Medici collected fees of 4.6 million euros from Thema International Fund in 2007. Following the news that Bank Medici had invested US$2 billion with Bernard Madoff, officials in Vienna appointed a supervisor to run the private bank, raising questions about control of the sprawling group. On 30 June 2005 Banca dell'Umbria and Cassa di Risparmio di Carpi were absorbed into the parent company. In 2006 the securities services business of UniCredit (2S Banca, now Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Security Services S.p.A.) was sold to Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale for ‚Ç¨579.3 million. In 2006, minority interests in the savings banks of Bra (31.021%), Fossano (23.077%), Saluzzo (31.019%) and Savigliano (31.006%) were sold for about ‚Ç¨149 million to Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna. = Acquisition of Capitalia and recent history (2007‚Äì) = In 2007, in combination with the Capitalia Group, the fourth-largest Italian banking group (by total assets in 2006; Sanpaolo IMI and Banca Intesa were counted as one entity as the banks also merged in 2007);Table VI UniCredit Group consolidated and strengthened its position, but added considerably to its overhead costs. The registered office of the bank was also relocated from Genoa (inherited from Credito Italiano) to 17 via Minghetti, Rome. In the same year, two more acquisitions were carried out: ATF Bank, which ranks fifth out of domestic banks in Kazakhstan with 154 branches, and Ukrsotsbank, a universal bank in Ukraine. With these two banks the Group extended its operations in this area to 19 countries (including Central Asia). However, in November 2012, Kazakh government sources declared UniCredit is in talks with Kazakh investors over the sale of a controlling stake in ATF Bank. In 2010, UniCredit S.p.A. absorbed its Italian banking subsidiaries: UniCredit Banca, Banca di Roma and Banco di Sicilia. In 2013 UniCredit Finance reported that they would no longer provide banking services in Latvia.Unicredit stopped banking services in Latvia, Baltic Legal On March 14, 2014 UniCredit announced that it expected to cut around 8,500 jobs in the future, together with the announcement of a $15 billion loss in the 4th quarter of 2013 due to extensive cash-reserving for bad loans and writing down goodwill from acquisitions. UniCredit is one of the 6 European banks which are currently most exposed to potential problems in the emerging markets. In April 2015 UniCredit and Banco Santander reached a preliminary agreement to merge their asset-management businesses in a transaction valuing the combined entity at about ‚Ç¨5.4 billion. The accord created a holding company called Pioneer Investments that is 50 percent owned by UniCredit and 50 percent held by the U.S. buyout firms Warburg Pincus LLC and General Atlantic LLC. The holding firm owns Pioneer's U.S. business and controls combined operations of UniCredit's Pioneer, excluding its U.S. activities, and Santander Asset Management. The two lenders hold each one third of the new combined business, while Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic owns the rest. However, the deal was terminated on 27 July 2016. Nevertheless, Pioneer was sold in December 2016 to Amundi for ‚Ç¨3.545 billion. UniCredit also received an extraordinary dividend of ‚Ç¨315 million from Pioneer. From June 2015 to January 2017 UniCredit sold its NPLs that was doubtful to collect (sofferenze) to various investors, namely PRA Group Europe (‚Ç¨625 million gross), a fund managed by Cerberus Capital Management (‚Ç¨100 million gross), a US fund (‚Ç¨150 million gross), AnaCap Financial Partners (‚Ç¨420 million gross), Fortress Investment Group and PIMCO (‚Ç¨17.7 billion gross; UniCredit retained minority stake in the securitization SPV), B2 Kapital (‚Ç¨110 million in gross from Slovenian subsidiary) and B2Holding (‚Ç¨93 million from UniCredit Bulbank). In October 2015, UniCredit also sold UniCredit Credit Management Bank (now doBank), the subsidiary that specialized in managing NPLs to Fortress Investment Group and Prelios S.p.A.. A portfolio of ‚Ç¨2.4 billion (in gross book value) NPLs was included in the deal. On a year to year basis, net value of sofferenze had increased from ‚Ç¨19.701 billion at 31 December 2014 to ‚Ç¨19.924 billion at 31 December 2015 (or from ‚Ç¨52.143 billion to ‚Ç¨51.089 billion in gross). In December 2016 UniCredit sold Polish bank Bank Pekao. UniCredit had already sold part of the stake in FinecoBank in mid 2016, as well as sold Ukrainian bank Ukrsotsbank to Alfa Group in January 2016. In December 2016, the card business in Italy, Germany and Austria were sold to SIA for ‚Ç¨500 million. On 13 December 2016, despite the annual European Central Bank (ECB) Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) lowed the CET1 ratio (transitional basis) requirement of UniCredit from 9.75% to 8.75%, the bank announced a massive ‚Ç¨13 billion recapitalization of the bank, as well as ‚Ç¨8.1 billion loan loss provisions and net restructuring charges of ‚Ç¨1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. In 2016 European Union bank stress test announced on 29 July, UniCredit's CET1 ratio (fully loaded basis) was predicted at 7.10% in the adverse scenario on 31 December 2018, which was the second last among the big 5 Italian banks that participated in the stress test (the last was Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena). Based on 2016 SREP, UniCredit Group was required a fully load basis CET1 ratio of 10.5% from 1 January 2019 due to increase in Capital Conservation Buffer and global systemically important bank buffer as required by CRR and CRD IV. Moreover, the pillar 2 guidance: the additional capital that ECB suggested the bank to keep, was remained confidential. In January 2017 10 old ordinary shares were combined into 1 new ordinary share, as well as bearer savings share and registered savings share. On April 6, 2017, UniCredit issued its first bond in the United States in a decade. In mid-2017, a capital increase completed as well as securitization and partial disposal of the NPLs of the bank. In December 2017, the savings share () of the bank were converted to the ordinary share, as well as the removal of the 5% cap on voting rights for each entity.  Geography  The company has its registered office and general management in Milan. The registered office was located in Rome from the date of the merger with Capitalia in 2007, and relocated back to Milan in 2017. The registered office was located in Genoa from 1999 to 2007. UniCredit's core markets are Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia, Romania and Bulgaria.

The book was initially published in 1933 by Alden Press. Overview In 1925, British explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett, along with his son and another companion, disappeared while searching in Brazil for the Lost City of Z. Not long after, Peter Fleming, who was literary editor for London's The Times, answered a small ad seeking volunteers for an expedition to find out what had happened to them. Fleming's story of that 1932 expedition is told in Brazilian Adventure. Despite a great deal of fanfare, the expedition seems to have been very poorly organized. Fleming and his companions do not seem to have done much preparation, not even bothering to learn any Portuguese. They left everything up to the leader they hired, an eccentric American, Major George Lewy Pingle, who lived in Brazil. They sailed from England, met Pingle, and followed him to the Araguaya river and down it, with Fleming, an admirer of Hemingway, blasting away at the wildlife \\"for sport\\" as they went. When the expedition reached the Tapirap√© River, which Fawcett was known to have traveled, the group fell apart. Major Pingle, whose bizarre moments of unreason had been making things more and more difficult all along, claimed the search was impossible and he was giving it up. Some of the members of the expedition agreed with him. Fleming and two others, however, decided to continue on their own and left to go up the Tapirape with their bearers. Traveling through the tropical jungle was very difficult, and, at the last, only Fleming and Roger, his former school fag [younger student semi-servant], could keep going. When they spotted natives in the distance who were said to be cannibals, they turned back. They were still uncertain about the fate of Fawcett, but they had turned up more clues than they started with. Returning to the mouth of the Tapirape and heading back up the Araguaya, Fleming and his group found Major Pingle and the others. Fleming desperately wanted to be the first to get back to civilization with his version of why they had split, because Pingle was trying to get his own version, which was harshly critical of Fleming, to arrive first. So the two groups furiously raced each other down the long Tocantins and Amazon rivers to the port city of Para, where they could report back to England and catch a ship for home. The book is a light but interesting read, with colorful descriptions of the landscape and its inhabitants. Fleming is very much a product of his time and class, however, exulting in the notion that he is going where \\"no one has ever been before,\\" ignoring the fact that the natives have been living there for many thousands of years. The book's claim to fame is that, as the author puts it, it is \\"honest,\\" completely factual. It challenges prior works of travel literature that exaggerate the dangers of the wild and the heroics of the explorers, such as the over-the-top descriptions of daring-do found in Colonel Fawcett's own writings. But the modern reader may wonder whether Fleming does not himself sometimes distort the facts, especially those concerning his difficult but not oddly danger-free last trek into the unknown with Roger. The reader may also wonder how seriously Fleming himself took the search for Fawcett, though he is clearly committed to showing great effort because his employer is paying for him to do it. His reportage was not much questioned in its day, however, and the book is still considered something of a classic in travel literature, along with Fleming's later two books, One's Company: A Journey to China in 1933 (published in 1934) and News from Tartary: A Journey from Peking to Kashmir (1936), both of which were widely read by the public and were influential with other travel writers.

In 1974, Worch started a militant group called the Hansabande in Hamburg, along with Michael K√ºhnen. The group defaced Jewish graveyards, assaulted leftists and foreigners,\\"Netzwerk, Gegen Rechtsextremismus, f√ºr Toleranz und Menschenw√ºrde\\": Drahtzieher im braunen Netz: Christian Worch and \\"Kulturinitiative Detmold e.V\\": Redebeitrag am 20.01.2007 auf der Mahnwache in Obernkirchen anl√§sslich der erneuten Sch√§ndung des J√ºdischen Friedhofs in der Silvesternacht. Both retrieved 2007-02-12 and denied the Holocaust. Worch took part in one especially well-known campaign under the motto \\"I am an ass to believe that Jews were gassed in Germany\\" (Ich Esel glaube, da√ü in Deutschland Juden vergast worden sind). The group gradually became the Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten (ANS, Action Front of National Socialists) in 1977. Worch and K√ºhnen were also close to the now-banned Wiking-Jugend (Viking Youth). K√ºhnen was arrested in 1979 and Worch took over leadership of the ANS. In 1980 he was convicted, receiving a three-year prison sentence, despite being defended by J√ºrgen Rieger during his trial. In 1983, the organization, now known as the ANS/NA (Aktionsfront Nationaler Sozialisten/Nationale Aktivisten, Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists) was banned, so Worch joined the Free German Workers' Party (FAP) and became vice- chairman. As the Nationale Liste (National List) was founded in 1989, he became active in its executive committee. He edited its magazine, Index, until September 1991 and was especially active in anti-Antifa work. In this campaign, lists of names and addresses of left-wing and anti-fascist activists and organizations were published; this led to attacks on some of the people listed. Worch was one of the main initiators of the campaign. After K√ºhnen died in 1991, Worch, along with Winfried Arnulf Priem and Gottfried K√ºssel, took over the Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front (GdNF); this led to him receiving a two-year suspended sentence in 1994. He had to serve this jail time beginning in February 1996 because he continued the ANS/NA despite its having been banned, but he was released early in 1997. For a short time in the 1990s, Worch had close relations with the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and was a link between neo-Nazi groups and the NPD. In an interview, he defended his collaboration with the party, saying that \\"the NPD is as a party, of course, only a means to propagate our worldview\\". However, he has since distanced himself from the party. Worch also collaborates with Gary Lauck's NSDAP/AO (1972), and is known as one of the main organizers of the Rudolf Hess Memorial March, which takes place once a year in Wunsiedel, Bavaria, where the remains of Rudolf Hess were formerly buried, and is one of the most important events for European neo-Nazis.

The park includes the Elsa Kimbell Environmental Education and Research Center and a variety of natural habitats: sand pine scrub, pine flatwoods, mangroves, and river swamps. The Loxahatchee River, designated a National Wild and Scenic River in 1985 (the first in Florida), runs through the park. The park is also along the Ocean to Lake Trail. The park is at 16450 S.E. Federal Highway, Hobe Sound. The park is well known for its Camp Murphy Mountain Bike Trails. History The park is named after Jonathan Dickinson, a Quaker merchant who was shipwrecked in 1696, with his family and others, on the Florida coast near the present-day park. He wrote a journal describing their encounters with local tribes, and their journey up the coast to St. Augustine. A man known as Trapper Nelson homesteaded on the banks of the Loxahatchee River after coming to the area in the 1930s, living off the land trapping and selling furs. He soon became known as the Wildman of the Loxahatchee. After he died in 1968 the state acquired his land, and deeded it to the park. The United States Army established Camp Murphy, a top-secret radar training school, in the area that is now the park, in 1942. The camp included over 1,000 buildings, and housed more than 6,000 officers and soldiers. The camp was deactivated in 1944, after only two years of operation. Most of the camp buildings were torn down, but some of the building foundations remain. The property was transferred to the State of Florida in 1947, and opened as a state park in 1950. Recreational activities The park has such amenities as bicycling, boat tours, boating, cabins, canoeing, fishing, hiking, horse trails, kayaking, picnicking areas, swimming, wildlife viewing and full camping facilities. It also has the Elsa Kimbell Environmental Education and Research Center, with exhibits about the park's natural and cultural history. The park operates a 44-passenger boat for tours of Trapper Nelson's homestead. In film Jonathan Dickinson State Park was used to film the first segment of the second episode of BBC's Walking with Monsters, set in Late Carboniferous Kansas. Popular Mountain bike channels on YouTube such as BKXC and BCPOV have featured the park's Camp Murphy Mountain Bike trails.

In Hindu tradition a sahasranama is a type of devotional hymn (Sanskrit: stotra) listing many names of a deity. The names provide an exhaustive catalog of the attributes, functions, and major mythology associated with the figure being praised. The Shiva Sahasranama is found in Shiv Mahapuran and many other scriptures such as Linga Purana. As per Shiv Mahapuran when Vishnu was unable to defeat the demons after many attempts he prayed to Shiv who granted him the Sudarshan Chakra for fighting the demons. Variations There are at least eight different variations of the Shiva SahasranamaSharma, pp. viii-ix. while the one appearing in the Book 13 (Anushasana Parva) of the Mahabharata is considered as the main version. Mahabharata 13.17 translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguly (published between 1883 and 1896). This is the source for the version presented in Chidbhavananda, who refers to it being from the Mahabharata but does not explicitly clairify which of the two Mahabharata versions he is using. See Chidbhavananda, p.5. One version is contained in the Linga Purana while another version occurs in the Mahabharata. The overlapping of names with the Vishnu sahasranama has led Adi Shankara to conclude that Shiva and Vishnu are identical and both equal to monotheistic God, a conclusion that is now a central tenet of Advaitan or Smarta Hinduism. Also other names of Shiva were told by Krishna himself to Yudhisthira in the Mahabharata. Additionally, Krishna himself also recited another version of the Shiva Sahasranama, the 1008 names of Shiva, to him in the 17th chapter of AnushƒÅsanaparva in the epic Mahabharata, * Linga Purana (version 1, LP 1.65.54-168) is close to the Mahabharata Anushasanaparvan version. * Linga Purana (version 2, LP 1.98.27-159) has some passages in common with LP version 1, but also with other sources * Shivapurana 4.35.1-131. * Mahabharata (≈öƒÅntiparvan version). The critical edition of the Mahabharata does not include this version; it is considered part of book 12 (≈öƒÅntiparvan), but is relegated to Appendix 28 in the critical edition, representing a late addition to the text. The Gita Press edition restores it as part of the main text, as verses 12.284.68-180. * Vayu Purana (1.30.179-284) is almost the same as the Mahabharata ≈öƒÅntiparvan version. * Brahmanda Purana (38.1.1-100) is almost the same as the Vayu Purana version. *Mauritius.

After working as an actress in Andy Warhol's Pork, she worked as a publicist for David Bowie, before becoming a rock singer. She subsequently became a publicist for Vangelis. Career Kathleen Dorritie was born in Woodside, New York. Adopting the stage name Cherry Vanilla, she starred in the London productions of Andy Warhol's play, Pork, directed by Tony Ingrassia, and other theatre of the ridiculous plays including a role as a necrophiliac nurse. She worked for MainMan LTD as David Bowie's publicist, in the early 1970s. She became known for her outrageous marketing strategies, which included an open offer to perform oral sex on any DJ who would play Bowie's records and a series of radio commercials that began \\"Hi, my name is Cherry Vanilla and I've got scoops for you‚Ä¶\\" while working for Radio Hanoi in opposition to the Vietnam war. After parting ways with Bowie in 1974, Vanilla formed her first band with Kasim Sulton, which played under her name. In 1976, she formed Cherry Vanilla & her Staten Island Band, with Buzzy John Vierno (bass guitar), Frank La Rocca (drums), Thomas Morrongiello (guitar), and Gary Cohen (piano). The group's first released material was the track \\"Shake Your Ashes\\", on the Max's Kansas City album of 1976. 1976 also saw the release of Vanilla's art book, Pop Tart. Her high profile in New York was the impetus for Miles Copeland III to invite her to England. She relocated to London in 1976, becoming part of the burgeoning punk scene and was signed by RCA Records. The London-based Cherry Vanilla Band initially consisted of Vanilla's boyfriend/guitarist Louis Lepore and pianist Zecca Esquibel, along with bassist Gordon \\"Sting\\" Sumner, guitarist Henry Padovani and drummer Stewart Copeland, who loaned their services and equipment in exchange for ¬£15 a night and the support spot on her tour, including a date on March 5, 1977 at London's legendary Roxy Club. (The support spot was for Copeland's band The Police, and would be the setting for the band's first live performances.) A more permanent line-up comprised Louis Lepore (guitar), Zecca Esquibel (keyboards), Howie Finkel (bass guitar), and Michael (Manny) Mancuso (drums). Their first release was the single \\"The Punk\\" in September 1977, followed in February 1978 by the debut album Bad Girl. Finkel and Esquibel left the band and with a string of replacements the band continued, releasing another single and a second album, Venus D'Vinyl, in 1979.

It was reissued (with News from Tartary) as half of Travels in Tartary.

The bank maintains an extensive network in Austria, with about 7,700 employees serving customers in some 300 branches. Bank Austria also served as UniCredit's intermediate holding company for the banking network in Central and Eastern Europe (until September 2016), a region where the Group is the clear market leader with about 3,900 branches in 19 countries. However, all the CEE subsidiaries were transferred to the parent company in September 2016. As per 2008, 85% of Bank Austria's total workforce is employed out of Austria. Since 2007, Bank Austria is also responsible for all UniCredit affiliates in the European Union. Thus, Bank Austria inherited operation in 20 countries it had no representation before, of which even UniCredit had no activity. However, Bank Austria could not retrieve its business in Poland, where it had been well represented by BHP. The 2000s saw the bank in the middle of substantial litigation around trustee Rudolfine Steindling's transfer of former East German, now German, money to her own accounts. In 2010 a Swiss court ruled Der Standard, Austrian newspaper in German that the predecessor √ñsterreichische L√§nderbank had broken the law by aiding her to channel away the money and had to pay ‚Ç¨240 million but a higher court overruled this decision on formal grounds. Total assets of Bank Austria as at 31 December 2011 were EUR 199.2 billion. Bank Austria is the number one banking partner for Austrian companies: * 80 per cent of large corporates * 37 per cent of medium-sized companies * 21 per cent of small businesses have confidence in Bank Austria's services. History BA-CA's history goes as far back as 1855, the year the Creditanstalt was founded (see article on Creditanstalt). In 1991, savings bank Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank Wien and financially depressed, state-owned √ñsterreichische L√§nderbank merged to form Bank Austria, by then the largest bank in the country. Current corporation was established in 1996 and German WestLB took a 9.1% share.http://www.firmenabc.at/unicredit-bank-austria-ag_EdA The same year, the government announced the privatization of Creditanstalt, of which it held a 51% stake. In January 1997 Bank Austria finally managed to buy the stake for about 1.25 billion euros. In turn, Bank Austria sold a majority stake in GiroCredit for 8.24 billion schillings (about 600 million euros) to Erste Bank. In February 1998, the state sold its last shares and the remaining shares on the market were exchanged with shares in Bank Austria, and Creditanstalt was delisted from the Vienna Stock Exchange. In 2000, HVB Group took over Bank Austria through a share exchange procedure, and Bank Austria was delisted. An assets exchange procedure led to the transfert of HVB's assets in central and eastern Europe to Bank Austria, and reversely. In March 2003, Bank Austria's merger with CreditAnstalt being fully effective, and IPO was offered for the new BA-CA. In June 2005 Italian group UniCredit disclosed the acquisition of Hypovereinsbank, along with BA-CA. Restructuring led to the creation of a new holding for BA-CA foreign assets in eastern Europe, the transformation of the Polish activity to a full affiliate, the shrinking of BA-CA per se to a smaller market, and the shrinking of HVB to the German market. In order to respect cartel restriction, BA-CA's affiliate Splitska banka had to be sold to Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, for UniCredit already owned Zagrebaƒçka banka, what management was transferred to BA-CA. BA-CA acquired Ko√ß Finansal Hizmetler (Turkey), Zagrebaƒçka banka (Croatia), Bulbank (Bulgaria), ≈Ωivnostenska banka (Czech Republic), UniBanka (Slovakia) and UniCredit Romania from UniCredit in that operation. In 2006 BA-CA continued its expansion in Russia by acquiring remaining shares in International Moscow Bank and 100% of institutional business of Aton Capital - a Russian brokerage.

Management As of 2016 Bank Austria is managed by CEO Robert Zadrazil. The Chairman is Erich Hampel. Activity in central and eastern- Europe Bank Austria has a long tradition of operations in central and eastern Europe. After outbreak of World War I, foreign affiliates of the Creditanstalt and the L√§nderbank had to be abandoned. In 1975 Creditanstalt became the first Western bank to open an office in Budapest. In 1997, the activities of Creditanstalt and Bank Austria in the region were brought under the umbrella of a new holding company, Bank Austria Creditanstalt International. It was expanded to all foreign activities, with the exception of the Russian banks, a year later. A great deal of Bank Austria's turnover is made in central and eastern Europe.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 25 May 2000. Edna had been living in the village for many years prior to her first appearance on screen. She may have a vicious temper, but Edna has a good heart, which is demonstrated by her devotion to her friends and her beloved dogs. Edna is also known for her hats, which have been known to reflect her personality. She is rarely seen without a hat. Edna died off-screen on 3 May 2016 after it was reported in December 2015 that Stelfox had died. Storylines A committed member of the parish church, Edna was horrified when local vicar Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) began dating pub landlady Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) and was one of a group of people who opposed the match. Edna was pleased when her teenaged granddaughter Eve Jenson (Raine Davison/Suzanne Shaw), came to live with her in 2001. Eve became involved in a hit and run accident, when her boyfriend Marc Reynolds (Anthony Lewis) accidentally killed their teacher Miss. Strickland. Eve successfully manipulated Edna into believing Marc had been a bad influence, whereas in fact the reverse was true. Edna refused to believe stories about Eve's bad behaviour, until her good friend Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) spotted Eve cruelly kicking Edna's beloved dog Batley. Finally seeing her true colours, Edna sent Eve back to live with her father in France. When Batley fell ill and had to be put down, Edna was heartbroken and it took a long time for her to get over his death. Despite her initial reluctance, Edna later got a new dog, Tootsie, who brought a lot of pleasure back into her life. Len Reynolds (Peter Martin) was an old friend of Edna and once it looked like romance might be brewing between them. Len did tell Edna that he was in love with her. Unfortunately, Edna didn't feel the same and told Len this, although she was displeased when he started dating Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson). Since the flamboyant pensioner was her absolute opposite, it took Edna a long time to warm to her. A woman of contradictions, Edna was the only person to defend Len and Pearl when Pearl's son, convicted rapist Frank Bernard Hartbourne (Rob Parry), came to live with them. Her friendship helped them decide to stay in Emmerdale when everyone else nearly drove them out. They bonded over having trouble with their sons and became close friends. Edna was devastated by the demise of her beloved friend Len in 2007. She and Pearl fell out about Len's feelings for Edna for a while but later reconciled. Sam (2004) In June 2004, Edna was the victim of a hit and run while walking Tootsie. She fell into a ditch, breaking her hip. Her lifeless body was first discovered by Shadrach Dingle (Andy Devine) who, rather than raise the alarm, helps himself to cash from her purse. The blame initially fell onto Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) as it was his car involved. However, Sam Dingle (James Hooton) later admitted responsibility. She was ashamed to learn that her grandmother was a prostitute and for a while, went into hiding. Edna found a new lease of life when she went to work as a PA for local businessman Tom King (Ken Farrington); Edna needed to pay off a loan Tom had offered her for a new boiler, and he was keen to have an efficient PA rather than the glamorous but incompetent young girls favoured by his sons. An unlikely duo, Tom and Edna became close friends. Knowing he could trust her, Tom often turned to her for advice. Taking King and Sons in hand proved quite difficult, causing her to clash repeatedly with Jimmy and Matthew King (Matt Healy) and quit when Tom retired. Edna later joined Tom when he started Home Farm Estates. Edna did not always approve of his decisions but believed Tom was a good man. Edna was disappointed when Tom chose to marry Rosemary Sinclair (Linda Thorson), as she had fallen for him. In October 2006, Peter Birch (Philip Bird) arrived in Emmerdale to ask his mother to attend Eve's wedded blessing in France. Edna refused, as she resented Peter's rejection of her faith and felt that she had failed to look after Eve properly.Emmerdale Fri 13 Oct, 7.00pm Emmerdale Fri 13 Oct, 7.00pm Emmerdale Mon 16 Oct, 7.00pm Edna was later persuaded to attend the blessing, where she came face to with sister Lily Butterfield (Anne Charleston) after an estrangement of many years. Edna confided in Tom that Lily was Peter's birth mother. Edna adopted him as a baby but Tom and Edna's friendship ended when he used this to blackmail her to keep quiet about the Kings' role in the showhome disaster. As a result, Edna decided to tell Peter the truth about his parentage so Tom couldn't blackmail her. Unfortunately Peter didn't take it well and rejected Edna completely. Edna hated Tom for this and handed in her resignation.Emmerdale Wednesday, 15 November 2006 Nevertheless, she was sad to learn of his death. In March 2007, Edna's dog, Tootsie, was not feeling herself. Billy Hopwood (David Crellin) noticed and Edna phoned vet Hari Prasad so he made a home visit and found Tootsie was close to giving birth. Edna hadn't known Tootsie was pregnant. Later on, two healthy puppies were delivered. Edna's sister Lily returned to the village in 2007 and began growing cannabis in Home Farm's polytunnel. She found cannabis was more effective for her arthritis than prescription medicines but Eli Dingle (Joseph Gilgun) discovered what Lily was doing at Home Farm. He blackmailed her into splitting her crop with him in return for his silence but he was selling his share. When the police invaded Edna's home and arrested Lily, Edna evicted Lily in disgust at her unlawful activity. Lily returned in March 2008 and during an argument, Edna admitted she'd always resented her sister for being the one who had adventures. Lily and Edna made up. Following the drama with the winning raffle ticket, Edna asked Peter to visit, which he did. She asked him to pay back the money he had got from selling the car Lily and her friends/colleagues had won but he refused, claiming it was tied up. When Edna confronted him over taking Lily's savings, it became clear he felt she owed him that for abandoning him as a baby. Edna told Lily that he had agreed to pay back the money but quietly arranged to withdraw the money needed from her savings. Near the end of 2008, Lily began having dizzy spells and learned she had a brain aneurysm. She refused to face the severity of her condition, which only Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) knew about, and she swore him to secrecy. Edna became suspicious of Lily's relationship with Rodney. She, believed they were in a relationship and became even more suspicious when they disappeared together during December. When Lily fled hospital right before her surgery, Rodney told Edna, who, in spite of being hurt over her sister's lack of trust in her, managed to convince Lily to have the surgery. Edna convinced Lily to move in with her to help her recuperate, but after a short time, Lily felt smothered and moved back in with Pearl. As a devout Christian, she was horrified when, in November 2008, the local church was revealed to be closing. To stop this, she and around twelve other villagers started a choir. During this time, she took in Nicola De Souza after discovering she was homeless. She later kicked Nicola out when she found out Nicola had secretly been working with David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) and Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) to sabotage the choir and buy and then demolish the church. This happened around the same time as the day of the choir competition, which Edna missed to be with Lily at the hospital. In spite of Edna's absence, the choir won, but Bishop George informed them the church was still being closed. Edna and the other parishioners were furious and with the encouragement of a reformed Nicola, staged a lock-in on Christmas Day which convinced Eric and David to not buy the church. However, the church was still up for sale. In early 2009, Mark (Maxwell Caulfield) and Natasha Wylde (Amanda Donohoe) bought the church. When the villagers angrily confronted them in The Woolpack, they decided to give the church to the village as a gift. In early 2010, Edna had a lodger called Sally Spode (Si√¢n Reeves). Sally was originally living with Ashley until he flipped and she reluctantly. Sally told Edna, that she had been beaten by her husband Vincent and that she was terrified of him. Edna then suggested to Ashley that Sally move in with her at her cottage permanently. Sally smashed Edna's window and faked that her husband Vincent did it to set scores with Sally. Edna was horrified but still allowed Sally to stay in her cottage. Later, Edna found out that it was Sally who smashed her window not Vincent. Edna later believed Sally's accusations about Ashley abusing and torturing her that she informed Bishop George, who suspended Ashley as vicar pending further investigation. When Sally's true colours were revealed to Edna, she apologised to Ashley before throwing Sally out. She then confronted Sally and accused her of torturing Ashley not vice versa. Edna was disgusted with Sally and hated that she had been fooled. She then told Betty who told Pearl and the gossip about the events spread round the village. Since Sally has been gone, Ashley and Edna went back to the vicarage and found it trashed with the writing \\"burn in hell\\" above the fire, along with a family photo smashed, both were horrified. Ashley and Edna later realised the lies that Sally had portrayed. Ashley threatened Sally that he would kill her. Later in the day, Terry informs Ashley that Sally has left the village but he and Edna are left shocked when they find his house wrecked with \\"burn in hell\\" painted on the wall but Ashley realises that it may be too late to save his marriage now. In December 2008, the Kings lost their business empire, their home and their brother, Matthew. Carl and Jimmy King (Nick Miles) started up a haulage business and Edna was aghast when she saw the poor job Scarlett Nicholls (Kelsey-Beth Crossley) was doing in her attempts to be a receptionist. She helped out one day, and so impressed Jimmy that he asked her to work for them. Edna agreed and got on well with Jimmy so much so that he became convinced she had a crush on him. Edna bonded with young Scarlett over her troubled love life, baking a pie and convincing Scarlett to pass it off as her own to boyfriend Daz. A distraught Edna lost her wedding ring, not realising she had dropped it into the pie, leading Daz to worry that Scarlett was proposing marriage. Soon they worked everything out and Edna got her ring back. Edna's biological great-niece and adoptive granddaughter Eve returned to stay with Edna in April 2010. In 2012, Edna's dog, Tootsie, fell ill with cancer and Jimmy suggested she retire and spend time with Tootsie during her final months. For this reason, as well as a dislike towards the King Brothers' new business partner, Charity Sharma who wants to sack Edna, she decides to take up Jimmy's advice. Edna is upset after Carl is murdered during Emmerdale's 40th anniversary live episode in October 2012. No longer working and having spent a lot of money on Tootsie's vet care, Edna went through a period of financial hardship during 2013, which peaked when Jimmy found her unconscious in her house due to not being able to afford heating or food. Edna had tried to hide her money worries from friends and neighbours, but only began to recover with the help of the community, culminating in Sandy Thomas (Freddie Jones) becoming her lodger to give her an income source, and after he needed a new place to say. Edna and Sandy have become closer and have been joined in her cottage by Sandy's son Ashley and Ashley's new boss Harriet Finch (Katherine Dow Blyton). Harriet is Edna's first cousin once removed, as the daughter of Edna's unseen cousin Mildred. In August 2014, Edna revealed to Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), who is openly gay, that her late husband, Harold, was also gay, and had married her out of \\"convenience\\", as homosexuality was still illegal in the United Kingdom at the time. Believing Aaron was in love with his heterosexual best friend Adam Barton (Adam Thomas), Edna also revealed that Harold had a lover, Lawrence, and had been jealous that Harold could never love her in the same way - pointing out the same would be true for Aaron and Adam. A guilty Edna later admitted to Sandy that she'd reported Lawrence to the police in revenge, and that he had later committed suicide in prison. Sandy tries to find out where Lawrence is buried, in the hope that visiting his grave may give Edna some comfort. However, he is shocked to discover instead that Lawrence White (John Bowe) is still alive. He visits Edna and the pair make their peace, although Edna finds it difficult when he later moves to the village. In December 2014, Edna is devastated and distraught to discover that her house has been robbed and her pension has gone missing. The culprit turns out to be Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper), who has been experiencing hearing the voice of her late friend, Gemma Andrews (Tendai Rinomhota), who forced her in the mind to trash Edna's house. In January 2016, Pearl mentions that Edna is going to stay with Lily for a while. In reality, Edna had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and went to stay with Lily in order to keep it secret. In May 2016, Ashley receives a phonecall from the hospital, informing him that Edna's condition has taken turn to the worse. Later, Ashley and Laurel return from the hospital with Tootsie and break the news that Edna has died from her illness, devastating Harriet, Pearl and Sandy. Edna's funeral was held on 13 May 2016. Departure Shirley Stelfox died on 7 December 2015 after a short battle with cancer. John Whiston, ITV's creative director for soaps, led the tributes: \\"The family here at Emmerdale are deeply saddened by Shirley's passing. It is hard to imagine Emmerdale without her,\\" Whiston commented. \\"We offer our condolences to Shirley's family and share our feeling of loss with the millions of viewers who will miss Edna enormously.\\" On 16 April 2016, it was announced that Edna would die off-screen in early May.

Biography Du≈°ek was born in Chotƒõborky, which was part of Vilantice, in the Kingdom of Bohemia. He was taught the harpsichord in Vienna by Georg Christoph Wagenseil and established himself around 1770 in Prague as a successful keyboard teacher. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was probably his guest in his Villa Bertramka in Ko≈°√≠≈ôe, just outside Prague, although no documentation exists to support claims originating in nineteenth-century literature that he stayed there frequently. Mozart himself never reported staying there and no contemporary witness ever reported seeing him there. The best evidence that he ever stayed there comes from a reminiscence of Mozart's son Karl Thomas Mozart that dates from 1856 and indicates that he was at the Bertramka during his second visit to Prague (during October and November 1787). Karl Thomas was not himself a witness to the incident reported, rather he only heard about it from friends of Mozart whom he met as a child in Prague during the 1790s.Freeman 2013, 138-39. Furthermore, there is no documentation to support widespread claims that Mozart completed the operas Don Giovanni and La clemenza di Tito at the Bertramka, or indeed that he even worked on them there. Du≈°ek died in Prague. He was a teacher of Mozart's son Karl Thomas, who became a gifted pianist, although he did not pursue a career in music. Du≈°ek's wife Josepha Hambacher (7 March 17538 January 1824) had been taught by him and was a famous pianist and soprano. She sang important soprano roles in Mozart operas in early performances, and Mozart's concert aria Bella mia fiamma (catalogued as K. 528) was written for her. Du≈°ek composed sonatas, variations and concertos for harpsichord and piano and several symphonies and string quartets. Much of his music is in the galant style of the early Classical period.

The book recounts Fleming's journey from Peking, China to Kashmir, India in 1935. He was accompanied on this journey by Ella Maillart (Kini). The journey started on 16 February 1935 and took seven months to complete. The objective of the journey was, as contained within the title of the book, to ascertain what was happening in Tunganistan, a region of Sinkiang (also known as Chinese Turkestan), in the aftermath of the Kumul Rebellion. Fleming met with Ma Shaowu and Ma Hushan while in Xinjiang. The author notes that \\"Tartary is not strictly a geographical term, any more than Christendom is\\", and goes on to point out that Tartary is merely the name given to the place where the Tartars come from. He explains that in his usage it refers to Sinkiang and the highlands bordering it. The journey took the travellers from Peking to Tungkuan, then Sian, Pingliang, Lanchow, Sining, Dzunchia, Teijinar, Issik Pakte, Cherchen, Niya, Keriya, Khotan, Guma, Karghalik, Yarkand, Kashgar, Tashkurgan, Hunza, Nagar, Gilgit and finally Srinagar.

The castle was first recorded by Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) in 1188. Garth Quarry was opened in 1870 to produce granite setts for transport to developing towns and cities by the newly opened Cambrian Railways. The quarry now produces roadstone and railway ballast.

He distinguished himself in particular by his chivalrous and devout spirit. He was charitable and made great donations to the church, so that the monasteries and prayer houses in the area of present-day Nassau experienced the most significant bloom in his time. The greatest favour was the Teutonic Order to enjoy, to which he donated especially for the renunciation of his brother's, upon his entry into the order.Joachim (1880). Henry participated in the Sixth Crusade. He was the builder of the castles Sonnenberg, Ginsburg and Dillenburg.  Biography  Coat of Arms of the Counts of Nassau Sonnenberg Castle Ginsburg Castle Keppel Abbey Arnstein Abbey Henry II was the eldest son of Count Walram I of NassauVorsterman van Oyen (1882). and a certain Kunigunde, possibly a daughter of a count of Sponheim or a daughter of count Poppo II of Ziegenhain. Henry is mentioned for the first time in a charter dated 20 March 1198, together with his mother and his brother Rupert IV. This mention means that he and his brother were of age at that time, that is to say, they had reached the age of 12. Henry is mentioned as count of Nassau between 1198 and 1247. He reigned with his brother Rupert until 1230. = National politics = In the politics of the Holy Roman Empire, Henry was generally a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen emperors. However, between 1209 and 1211, he backed the rival Otto IV of Brunswick as emperor, before reverting sides to support Frederick II. Between 1212 and 1214, he held prisoner Frederick's (and his own) opponent, Archbishop Theodoric II of Trier.Thiele (1994), Table 307. Quoted at Genealogies of the Middle Ages .

In 1228 Henry took part in the Sixth Crusade of Emperor Frederick II.Becker (1983), p. 10. In 1231 Henry attended the Imperial Diet of Worms and in 1232 he was at the imperial assembly of Frederick II in Ravenna. Later, however, Henry transferred to the papal camp, so that Frederick's son Conrad IV issued an execution order against him in 1241, about the success of which nothing is known. In 1247 Henry supported the election of Anti-King William II of Holland, who confirmed all Henry‚Äôs imperial possessions and gave him the right to mint coins. = Local politics = Henry's father had received the K√∂nigshof Wiesbaden from Emperor Frederick I in reward for his support of the emperor in the conflicts of 1170-1180.Reuling.In the article about Henry's father however is only stated: ‚ÄòWalram's close ties with the imperial house were rewarded with K√∂nigshof Wiesbaden.‚Äô In the article about Sonnenberg Castle on the German Wikipedia on the other hand is stated: ‚ÄòDie Nassauer waren von Friedrich I. wahrscheinlich als Dank f√ºr Ihre Unterst√ºtzung in den R√∂merz√ºgen 1154 mit dem K√∂nigshof Wiesbaden belehnt worden.‚Äô The Nassau possessions in this area were expanded around 1214 when Henry received the Imperial Vogtship (Reichsvogtei) over Wiesbaden and the surrounding K√∂nigssondergau, which he held as fiefdoms. About the year 1200, Henry, together with his brother Rupert, began building Sonnenberg on a spur of Spitzkippel peak in the Taunus above Wiesbaden. This was intended for protection against the Archbishop of Mainz and its vassals, the Lords of Eppstein, who held the lands bordering Wiesbaden. However, the cathedral chapter of St. Martin's Cathedral in Mainz claimed Sonnenberg as their own. To settle the dispute, Nassau paid 30 Marks to the cathedral chapter in 1221 to acquire the land of Sonnenberg Castle. They were also forced to recognize the sovereignty of the Archbishops of Mainz over Sonnenberg, taking the castle as a fief of Mainz.History of Sonnenberg , City of Wiesbaden website. . Retrieved on 2009-01-23. Towards the end of the 12th century, Walram I had been able to strengthen his power on the lower Lahn. As part of the inheritance of the Counts of Arnstein, he succeeded them as the Archbishopric of Trier's Vogt in Koblenz, Pfaffendorf (now a borough of Koblenz), Niederlahnstein, and Humbach (Montabaur). However, by the 1230s, Trier's influence near the Rhine and Lahn had strengthened enough to oust Nassau from the majority of the Archbishopric's vogtships. The Archbishop had reinforced Montabaur around 1217 in order to protect his possessions on the right bank of the Rhine from Nassau. In 1224, Henry found support from Engelbert II, the Archbishop of Cologne, who made Henry his Hofmarschall and Schenk (an honorary title that originally meant \\"cup-bearer\\"). However, in exchange for his protection from the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier, Henry had to cede half of Siegen to Cologne. Unaffected by this division of rule, however, Nassau retained its sovereign rights in Siegerland (the region surrounding Siegen), where the important High Jurisdiction (hohe Gerichtsbarkeit) and Hunting Ban (Wildbann) explicitly survived to 1259. During his reign, Henry fought out numerous feuds, especially with the nobles von Willnsdorf over Siegen, and von Merenberg over the Landgericht Rucheslo in the old Erdehegaue. In the Siegerland, Henry built Ginsburg Castle during his reign.Becker (1983), p. 9. Henry‚Äôs brother, Rupert, had joined the Teutonic Order in 1230. On his death in 1239, Rupert bequeathed his legacy to the Order. Henry continuously disputed any division of his realm with the Teutonic Order. Henry also held the Upper Vogtship over the Diocese of St. George in Limburg an der Lahn during the construction of the Limburg Cathedral. In 1239 he transferred, at the request of his vassal Friedrich vom Hain, the income of the Netphen parishes to the Premonstratensian Keppel Abbey near Hilchenbach. His descendants took over the patronage of the monastery.History of Stift Keppel . . Retrieved on 2009-01-29. Henry's policies in the Herborner Mark angered the local aristocratic families. Around 1240, Henry built Dillenburg Castle to better subjugate the dissidents. By 1248, the century-long Dernbacher Feud had already begun, involving Hesse as well in the context of the War of the Thuringian Succession, because of a feud started by Henry with Sophia of Thuringia and her son Henry I \\"the Child\\" of Hesse over the Herborner Mark, which burdened the Nassau-Hessian relationships beyond his death for centuries. The necrology of Arnstein Abbey documented the death of ‚ÄòHenrici comitis de Nassauwe, qui contulit nobis ecclesiam in Diffenbach inferiori ...‚Äô on 26 April. Henry is still mentioned in a charter from 1247 and is listed as deceased in a charter from 25 January 1251. This means that he died on 26 April in either 1247, 1248, 1249 or 1250. He was succeeded by his sons Walram II and Otto I.

The project was previously called Al Burj ( \\"The Tower\\"). In January 2009, it was announced that the project was put on hold due to financial problems. As a result of the Dubai World 2009 debt standstill, Nakheel Group's financial problems increased considerably and the tower was consequently cancelled in December 2009. Nakheel was in talks with several potential contractors, including South Korea's Samsung C&T; (who also built Burj Khalifa), Japanese Shimizu Corporation and Australian Grocon. WSP was Lead Consultant for the structure, heading a consortium that included LERA of New York and VDM of Australia, and working with architects Woods Bagot. Location The tower was proposed in 2003 as the centrepiece of Palm Jumeirah, one of the world's largest man-made islands. It was to be named \\"The Pinnacle\\" and rise from the centre of a canal on the trunk of the island. The height was to be and the building was to consist of 120 floors of luxury apartments. It was replaced by the Trump International Hotel and Tower and moved to the Dubai Waterfront. Although ground leveling and land reclamation had begun on the Dubai Waterfront, construction of the tower never started because of the proximity to the Al Maktoum International Airport. The location was changed to a plot near Jumeirah Lake Towers and Dubai Marina. The tower would have been the focal point of Nakheel's plans for the Ibn Battuta Mall development next to Jumeirah Islands and Jumeirah Lake Towers. It would have been the center of the Nakheel Harbour and Tower complex, which would have included about 20 smaller towers of up to 90 stories, a marina, and part of the Arabian Canal. The development would have been next to the revamped shopping mall. Design With Woods Bagot replacing Pei Partnership as the architectural partner, the latest released design had named the development Nakheel Harbour and Tower. Though in exterior appearance and function it would be a single tower over tall, this even grander incarnation would have been \\"made up of four towers with four individual cores forming an approximate 100 meters in diameter.\\" Nakheel also claimed on their engineering page that the towers would be joined by four-level, full diameter sky bridges at approximately every twenty-five floors. The sky bridges would act to tie the buildings together structurally as well as to provide each part of the building with its own village centre in the sky. It is the four codependent foundations that would have provided the necessary structural support for such a great relative height increase over existing supertalls. The design included a distinctive crescent-shaped podium encircling the base of the tower. The tower would have been serviced by 156 lifts at sufficient speeds and capacities to allow for travel from the ground floor to the observation deck in four minutes. Height Projections of Nakheel Tower's final height varied widely. Nakheel was believed to be engaging in a strategy of secrecy similar to that employed by Emaar with Burj Khalifa. According to officials at Nakheel, the tower was originally designed to be at least tall and have more than 160 floors, although an early render showed the tower with more than 200 floors. Companies involved in the project reported an initial height expectation of which was later reduced to . In July, 2007, Nakheel CEO Chris O'Donnell was reported to have said that \\"height isn't everything\\" and suggested that Al Burj might not be any taller than the Burj Khalifa, which is . Yet only a week later, Nakheel reaffirmed that the tower would be taller than 1 kilometer. A report on 20 June 2008 claimed that the tower was planned to be tall. Name During the history of the project it was known by three different names: Al Burj, Tall Tower, and Nakheel Tower. Initially named Al Burj, the project was renamed Tall Tower for a few months, until being changed to Nakheel Tower.

She had attempted to change British law so she could end her own life because of the pains and problems that she endured because of the terminal illness motor neurone disease, which she suffered from. She stated \\"I want to have a quick death without suffering, at home surrounded by my family\\".Husband pays tribute to Diane Pretty, BBC Pretty had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease several years before. Over time, the disease worsened and made it impossible for her to move or communicate easily even though her mental faculties remained normal. The illness resulted in her having to be looked after round the clock by her husband and nurses, meaning that she could not commit suicide, which she had said she would do if she was able to.\\"Diane Pretty makes final 'death with dignity' plea\\", The Guardian, 2002 She stated a wish that her husband should be able to assist her in ending her life, but this is classed as assisted suicide, which is a criminal offence in England and Wales under the Suicide Act 1961. Because suicide is a lawful option for those capable of committing it; it could be argued that refusing the option to those disabled could be considered discrimination, which is unlawful under both UK and European law. As such, assisting someone in committing suicide who cannot do so themselves cannot be considered a ‚Äúservice‚Äù which can be deprived. Neither of these were argued in the courts. Pretty took her case to court using the Human Rights Act 1998 to argue that the Director of Public Prosecutions should make a commitment not to prosecute anybody involved in helping her to die. She focused on Articles 3 and 8 in her argument. British courts did not accept Pretty's arguments, with the House of Lords, Britain's highest court at the time, eventually turning her case down.The Queen on the Application of Mrs Diane Pretty (Appellant) v Director of Public Prosecutions (Respondent) and Secretary of State for the Home Department (Interested Party) The European Court of Human Rights refused to acknowledge that the European Convention on Human Rights provided a right to die,Article 2 of the Convention ... can not give protection to the negative right to life (that is, the right to end it): and her appeal to that court also failed.ECHR, Pretty v. the United Kingdom, application no. 2346/02 She stated \\"I feel I have no rights,\\" after her appeal to the House of Lords was rejected.

Beers The brewery currently brews three beers: * De Koninck, 5% ABV * Triple d'Anvers, 8% ABV * Winterkoninck, 6.5% ABV, a seasonal brew In the past the brewery has brewed several beers, for which the production has now been discontinued: * Cuvee Antwerpen '93, introduced in 1993 when the brewery's home city was cultural capital of Europe, 8% ABV * Cuvee De Koninck, the commercial prolongation of the Cuvee Antwerpen '93, 8% ABV * Antoon, a special beer introduced for the Anthony van Dyck year in 1999, 6% ABV * Begyn, introduced for the B√©guinage Festival in Hoogstraten in 1999, 6.5% ABV * Pagadder, 6.5% ABV * Zomerkoninck, a seasonal brew with strawberries, introduced in 2007 for the Dutch market exclusively, 6% ABV * Gusto Golden Blond, 8% ABV * Gusto Ruby Red, 8% ABV * De Koninck Blond, 6% ABV History At the edge of the city of Antwerp, along the road to Mechelen, there was an inn 'De Plaisante Hof' (The Merry Garden). Despite the pleasant name, the inn was situated right across from the notorious gallows field (now King Albert Park) where, in the Middle Ages, murderers and other criminals were hanged. On this boundary between Antwerp and Berchem, in front of De Plaisante Hof, stood a stone boundary post showing a put-up hand which was token for the merchants entering the town to pay toll. This 'toll hand' now shows on the green right-side escutcheon of the De Koninck Brewery. These days, you can still admire it in the brewery itself. The hand is also recognized as the symbol of the city of Antwerp, whose name is (according to some) derived from the Dutch for 'hand'. On June 26, 1827, Joseph Henricus De Koninck, then husband to Elisabeth Cop, bought De Plaisante Hof. However, he died soon afterwards and his widow who then remarried Johannes Vervliet who bought back the goods from the inheritance in 1833. At that time Belgium was barely three years old (created in 1830). He turned the inn into a brewery which he named 'De Hand' (The Hand), after the toll sign mentioned earlier. By the time Johannes Vervliet died in 1845, the brewery's name was successful and its beer had become well known. The name De Koninck appeared for the first time with Vervliet's stepson, Carolus De Koninck, who continued the business. When he died in 1883, he was succeeded by his son Fran√ßois Joseph, and later by his daughter Josephina Joanna, as head of the family business. Sales were consistently good and the barley-based beer had become the most popular drink in the city of Antwerp. In 1912, the family business at the corner of the Mechelsesteenweg and the Boomgaardstraat was changed into a Limited Liability Company, Brewery Charles De Koninck, with Josephina De Koninck as principal shareholder. Florent Van Bauwel was appointed executive. According to the brewery's records, Van Bouwel applied himself so well, especially during the First World War, that Miss De Koninck favored him to take over the company. In 1919, Van Bouwel entered into a partnership with the Van den Bogaerts of Willebroek. Later, Florent Van Bauwel and Joseph Van den Bogaert were succeeded by their sons Joseph Van Bauwel and Modeste Van den Bogaert. Dominique and Bernard Van den Bogaert, sons of Modeste, continued leading the brewery after his death. In 2010, the brewery was sold to the Duvel Moortgat Brewery but still acts as an autonomous brand within the group.

Pyrin is produced in certain white blood cells (neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes) that play a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. Inside these white blood cells, pyrin is found with the cytoskeleton, the structural framework that helps to define the shape, size, and movement of a cell. Pyrin's protein structure also allows it to interact with other molecules involved in fighting infection and in the inflammatory response. Although pyrin's function is not fully understood, it likely assists in keeping the inflammation process under control. Research indicates that pyrin helps regulate inflammation by interacting with the cytoskeleton. Pyrin may direct the migration of white blood cells to sites of inflammation and stop or slow the inflammatory response when it is no longer needed. The MEFV gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3, from base pair 3,292,027 to 3,306,626. Related conditions More than 80 MEFV mutations that cause familial Mediterranean fever have been identified. A few mutations delete small amounts of DNA from the MEFV gene, which can lead to an abnormally small protein. Most MEFV mutations, however, change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make pyrin. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid valine at protein position 694 (written as Met694Val or M694V). Among people with familial Mediterranean fever, this particular mutation is also associated with an increased risk of developing amyloidosis, a complication in which abnormal protein deposits can lead to kidney failure. Some evidence suggests that another gene, called SAA1, can further modify the risk of developing amyloidosis among people with the M694V mutation. MEFV mutations lead to reduced amounts of pyrin or a malformed pyrin protein that cannot function properly. As a result, pyrin cannot perform its presumed role in controlling inflammation, leading to an inappropriate or prolonged inflammatory response. Fever and inflammation in the abdomen, chest, joints, or skin are signs of familial Mediterranean fever.  See also  * Familial Mediterranean fever.

Its main business is the sale of supplies and materials, for homeowners and the building trade. The company also trades in the kitchen and bathroom market, in which it has extensive ranges from budget take away offerings to bespoke professional designs. History Wickes Store Sign (2011) Wickes was founded by Henry Dunn Wickes, in Michigan, United States in 1854, and in 1972, Wickes Corporation, along with British builders merchant, Sankeys, opened its first store in the United Kingdom. By 1987, Wickes was trading from 41 locations, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In August 1996, serious accounting irregularities were uncovered. In November 1996, Bill Grimsey was appointed CEO, to oversee its recovery from the scandal, that saw its share price suspended and the banks foreclosing. In January 1997, Grimsey launched a rights issue, started an employee share scheme, and turned around the company to the point where it was bought by Focus Do It All, backed by Duke Street Capital, in September 2000. Wickes grew from 131 stores in October 2000 to 172 in March 2004, including the rebranding of 36 stores of Focus DIY. In December 2004, Focus Group sold Wickes to Travis Perkins. The sale was completed in February 2005. In October 2007, Wickes acquired seven stores from Focus DIY, after Cerberus Capital took it over in June 2007 for ¬£1, these stores were in Glossop, Mansfield, Penrith, Bulwell, Plumstead, Dumfries, and Hereford. New Style Wickes Store. Crawley, West Sussex (2019) In May 2011, it was announced that Wickes had purchased thirteen stores from the appointed administrators of Focus DIY, Ernst & Young, saving 345 jobs. By 2017, the company had over two hundred stores in the United Kingdom. In October 2016, The Independent reported that Wickes announced plans to shut stores amid ‚Äòuncertain trading‚Äô. In May 2018, the BBC reported that Wickes is to cut a third of its head office workforce in a bid to reduce costs. Parent company Travis Perkins said the cull would affect workers in Watford, Hertfordshire, where it employs three hundred people. In July 2019, along with reports of sales being up 9.7%, the parent company of Wickes, Travis Perkins, announced plans to action a demerger and spin off Wickes in the middle of 2020, quoting Wickes ‚Äúis well positioned to thrive as a stand alone business‚Äù and ‚Äúwill have the autonomy to execute on its strategy and allocate capital to its customer proposition and growth opportunities with a clearer focus.‚Äù Regional Operations =South Africa= In 1994, Wickes embarked on a joint venture in South Africa, with Federated Blaikie, which saw six Wickes branded stores open in Johannesburg and Pretoria. Following the financial troubles the parent company encountered, the venture ended in February 1997. Shortly afterwards, the Wickes name was removed from all stores in South Africa. =Mainland Europe= The Wickes brand ventured into some Northern European nations such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands. However, in December 1996, after financial irregularities were uncovered, Wickes management believed that the only way to survive the troubles was to concentrate solely on its United Kingdom operations. In June 1997, all mainland European operations were sold to the French DIY chain Bricorama. =Ireland= In April 2009, Wickes started an expansion into Ireland, opening its first franchised Irish store in Limerick. In February 2013, this franchise relationship ended, with the store closed down.

Its population at the 2001 UK census was 3,548, increasing to 3,787 at the 2011 Census. Tibshelf shares its boundaries with the villages of Morton, Pilsley, Newton, Teversal and Hardstoft. The village was the site of the UK's first inland oil well.(as is stated on road signs at either end of the village) In the 19th century, coal was discovered, coal mining overtook agriculture as the primary industry in the area, and a local railway system was developed. Two deep mines were sunk, but were under threat of closure for a number of years after a partial cave-in. Culture and community Tibshelf Church Tibshelf has since redeveloped itself into a popular place to live, in part due to its location near the M1 motorway (Tibshelf services was originally named Chesterfield Services, but was rebranded due to being closer to Tibshelf, and after pressure fom the local authoities) and its proximity to Nottingham, Sheffield, Derby, Chesterfield, Sutton-in-Ashfield and Mansfield. The route of the closed Great Central Railway line was redeveloped by Derbyshire County Council in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and now forms part of the Five Pits Trail network. These efforts received a Countryside Award in 1970, as indicated by a plaque at nearby Pilsley. The trail runs approximately , from Tibshelf to Grassmoor Country Park, though with the filling in of cuttings and removal of embankments it is virtually unrecognisable as a former railway line. Other leisure highlights include Tibshelf Ponds, which stand at an ex-colliery site. They are 2 popular and well-stocked fishing ponds, which contain mixed coarse fish and carp. Angling is controlled by Tibshelf and Newton Angling Club. One pond is available to fish on a day ticket, with the other being permit only. Tibshelf also has a large cricket field and modern pavilion built there by the behest of Lindsay Tydeswell (now a teacher at Tibshelf School), located adjacent to Shetland Road, towards the village's Southern boundary, with Newton. There are three schools in Tibshelf: Tibshelf Infant and Nursery School, on High Street; Tibshelf Town-End Junior School, on Alfreton Road; and Tibshelf School (a secondary school), on Doe Hill Lane. The Wheatsheaf Pubs which remain at time of writing are (from West to East) The Crown Hotel, The Royal Oak (as of 2017 re-branded as \\"The Twisted Oak\\"), King Edward VII, and The White Hart. Recently closed pubs include Tibshelf & Newton Miners' Welfare, The Slap and Tickle, The Wheatsheaf and Brook Street Social Club. At its \\"Pub Peak\\", Tibshelf had ten such establishments located within its boundary. The closed public house The Slap and Tickle was demolished in 2014 and construction began on a new building to relocate the Co-Operative store from further up High Street. The Wheatsheaf closed shortly after 2010 and has been converted into private dwellings. Transport Two railway stations once served Tibshelf. Tibshelf & Newton was on a branch line of the Midland Railway (later part of the LMS) from Westhouses & Blackwell on the Erewash Valley Line to Teversal, opened in 1863 and later extended to Mansfield Woodhouse. This line closed to passengers in 1930 but remained open for freight and coal trains for many years afterwards; the route is now a footpath and the main station building still stands. Tibshelf Town was opened in 1893 by the Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway (later part of the Great Central Railway and subsequently the LNER), on its line to Annesley, later part of the Great Central Main Line to London, optimistically reflecting Tibshelf's aspirations to obtain official town status. Tibshelf never did become a town but the station kept this name throughout its operating life. It closed in 1963, the line itself in 1966. The collieries in Tibshelf had closed in the 1930s, although coal mining continued to be a major source of employment for the village, with around 2,000 of Tibshelf's inhabitants working at local pits in the early 1980s. There was a third station in the parish, situated on the Midland's Erewash Valley Line, serving the villages of Stonebroom and Morton but named Doe Hill after the small hamlet in which it is situated. This station closed in 1960. A fourth station exists near the \\"Woodend\\" public house. Whilst it straddles the county boundary, the station building at platform level was in Tibshelf parish. The roadside booking hall is in Nottinghamshire.  Notable residents  *Tom Hulatt ‚Äì runner in the famous race when the 4 minute mile record was broken.

In 1993 Konchellah made an unexpected comeback when he won the B-race at the meeting in Zurich. He travelled to the World Championships in Stuttgart and looked strong in the heats and semi-finals. However, in the final he lacked the finishing kick that had earned him the gold medal in Tokyo two years before. The race was won by Paul Ruto and Konchellah finished third. Konchellah never won an Olympic medal as he suffered from asthma for long periods of his career which prevented him from entering the 1988 and 1992 Olympic Games. In the 800 m final at the 1984 Summer Olympics he had finished fourth. Konchellah's World Championships record of 1:43.06 min (1987) lasted until 2019.

Childhood Bropho was born in a bush camp at the back of the Coorinjie wine saloon at Toodyay, Western Australia, on 9 February 1930. His mother was Isobel Layland (1900‚Äì1993), who was the daughter of Clara Layland, a Nyungah woman who lived in the swamps on the fringes of Perth. His father was Tommy Nyinda Bropho (1899‚Äì1972), who was born at Argyle Downs Station on the Durack pastoral lease and was taken from his mother under the 1905 Aborigines Act and sent to an orphanage on the Swan River at the age of 7. It is believed he was named after a policeman called Brophy, who escorted him from Argyle Downs to Wyndham.

The protest was supported by the Kimberley Land Council, the Aboriginal Medical Service and Black Action. In 1980 Bropho published Fringedweller, an account of the third world living conditions of homeless Aboriginal people. During the 1980s Bropho was involved in protests against mining and urban development, including Noonkanbah and Bennett Brook. In 1986 he won a Supreme Court injunction against plans by the State Energy Commission to excavate a sacred site at Bennett Brook.Bropho & Fringedwellers of the Swan Valley v Wilson & State Energy Commission (1986) Supreme Court of Western Australia, SC Lib No 6338 (Rowland J).

Originally educated as a philosopher, Rokkan collaborated in the 1940s and 1950s as the assistant of Arne N√¶ss. Later on, his interest turned towards the study of politics, especially the formation of political parties and European nation-states. It was during this period that he collaborated with Seymour Martin Lipset. He is also known as a pioneer of using computer technology in the social sciences. He wrote on cleavage, comparative history, party systems and Catalan nationalism, among other topics. Rokkan is the creator of a series of models for state and nation formations in Europe.

Chak 285 GB, view of a street. Chak, a Punjabi word, is the land revenue settlement/assessment circle marking a contiguous block of land,Chak word comes from Chakar of mean wheel in Urdu.The wheel was used for Water well. There was one water well in a village at that time and every village number allotted as per water-well wheel.Technical terms in land revenue and law. now the individual chak circles have come to be associated with the name of the village founded within the revenue circle. Chak circles are based on the British Raj era revenue collection system. To enhance the government revenue during the British Raj, new canals were built to bring the barani (rainfed) areas under cultivation by introducing the irrigation to the bangar (upland) areas of Punjab region. Block of contiguous land irrigated by the specific Rajwaha were given a unique chak number each. The migrant farmers were brought in to settle into those newly irrigated areas around the core of new villages [which started out as dhanis]. Those new villages were called by the same name as their corresponding irrigation circle chak number. Government left it to those residents to give \\"chaks\\" a proper village name later. In due time, the term \\"chak\\" became synonymous with the term \\"village\\".Randhir Singh, Sir William Roberts, 1932, An economic survey of Kala Gaddi Thamman (Chak 73 g. b. ) a village in the Lyallpur District of the Punjab. Chaks are found mainly in the bagar tract on the tri-junction of Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab region. Chak, the administrative revenue assessment circle or division, is also called the Chakla, which is not to be confused with the other types of Chaklas.Technical terms in land revenue and law.  Nomenclature  The villages are named using a four-part British colonial era nomenclature: \\"Chak (number) (letters) (village name)\\". Variations exist but usually names of chak have four parts, # \\"Chak\\" prefix, # Number, a unique number for each village, # Letter, one or two letter which correspond to the code given to the specific source of water, such as the Rajwaha (irrigation channel), # Village name, settlements usually started out as the small dhanis which later evolved into the villages. The name of settlement is usually based on the name of village's founding chowdhury, gotra or jathera. Examples of four-part nomenclature are \\"Chak 106 JB Khichian\\" (JB denotes Jhang Branch canal), \\"Chak 445 GB Thaggan Wali\\" (GB denotes Gogera Branch canal) and \\"Chak 354/WB Dunyapur\\". other example Chak 236 GB Kilanwala (GB denotes Gugera Branch Canal) Examples of chak names with first three components of the four-part nomenclature are Chak 152 P (P denotes the Panjnad River from which they draw water), Chak 128 NB (NB denotes North Branch canal) and Chak 21 MB. Examples of chak names with first two components of the four-part nomenclature are Chak No. 22. Examples of chak names which now retain only the name of village are Chak Bahmanian (named after brahman caste), Chak Des Raj (named after the founder), Chak Mai Dass (named after the founder), Chak Bilgan, Chak Guru, etc. Chak is also a village in Danta Ramgarh Tehsil of the Sikar district in Rajasthan, manily populated by Pandits and Purohits.  Chakbandi Chak Bandi (‡§ö‡§ï‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä) or Killa Bandi (‡§ï‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä), in terms of land and revenue, is the process of land consolidation,August 2010, On The brink: Water governance in the Yamuna river basin in Haryana, Society for Promotion of Wastelands Development, PEACE Institute Charitable Trust, page vi. and Revenue Settlement. Chak bandi and Settlement is done by the Settlement Officer with the help of patwaris, lambardars and earlier zaildar (now abolished).1930, Punjab Settlement Manual, Punjab Government publications, point 235 and 578-282 on page 115, 272-273. Chakbandi, in terms of irrigation, means that each chak is irrigated by a branch water-course, fed by a sluice channel in the bank of the main canal where the amount of water given to each chak (farm) owner is in proportion to the area of its chak.1996, Gazetteer of the Chenab Colony: Lyallpur, Faisalabad, page 99. Block of contiguous land irrigated by the specific Rajwaha, also called irrigation circle, were given a unique chak number each. The Chak (‡§ö‡§ï) is also referred to as the Chakla (‡§ö‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ), which is different from the Chakla-belan for making roti or the Chakla (brothel). Land consolidation is a planned rationalisation, readjustment, rearrangement of land parcels and their ownership to improve the rural infrastructure and to implement the developmental and environmental policies (improving environmental sustainability and agriculture). For the Chakbandi, contour of village is surveyed, to determine the slope category and drainage profile of the village land in cordinal directions. The land is also evaluated based on its price and productivity. The land holdings of each farmer is consolidated in the standardised-sized \\"khet\\" (field plots of usually 1 acre each) and then redistributed to the landlords in proportion to their earlier fragmented land holding's price and productivity.R.B. Mandal, 1990, Land Utilization : Theory And Practice, Page 318. Each chak must contain the same relative quantity of good, bad and indifferent soil. In some tarafs (sides of a tract), almost every alternate field belongs to a different one of the four or five mauzas (villages) contained in it. In others the pattis (fragmented portion of land) are apportioned in long strips of land belonging to each of the different mauzas, and then again subdivided on the same principle.R. S. Whiteway, 1879, Report on the Settlement of the Muttra District, North-Western Provinces, page 40. Permanent Settlement is the process of confirmation of landlord's property rights in the form of tenure or ownership and fixing a corresponding property tax to be paid by the landlords to the government, for using the public infrastructure, such as canal water for irrigation which results in higher crop yield. Terms related to chakbandi in the measurement of land in Punjab are: Banjar, Jungle, Abadi, Shamlat, Gair Mumkin, Barani, Nahri, Chahi, Taal, Bigha, Doab, HALRIS, Khadir and Bangar, Khasra, Patwari, Shajra, Zaildar, etc.  Warrabandi, bharai and jharai \\"Wara\\" (‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ), a vernacular Haryanvi/Punjabi word for the Hindi word \\"bari\\" (‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä), simply means the \\"turn\\". Warabandi (‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä) means the rotational system of a weekly roaster for equitable distribution of irrigation water to the individual chak (field) of each farmer from a sluice outlet. Time allocated to each farmer to draw water from the sluice is proportional to the size of farmer's land holding. To optimise the system, once the wara of a farmer is over, the wara of next farmer in the sequence of contiguous land commences. Irrigators know their turn or wara in advance. For the fair distribution of water, warrabandi takes into consideration Bharai and Jharai. Bharai (‡§≠‡§∞‡§æ‡§à) is the common pool time taken from the release of water from canal through sluice or upstream farmer and its arrival at the delivery point of the farmer whose wara has arrived. Jharai (‡§ù‡§∞‡§æ‡§à) is the common pool time (time it takes for the water to arrive) applicable to the tail-end (last) farmer on the sluice.

McLain State Park is a public recreation area on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Houghton County, Michigan. The state park is located on M-203 halfway between Hancock and Calumet. It is about from each city. The park's offshore sights include sunsets over Lake Superior and the art deco‚Äìstyle Keweenaw Waterway Upper Entrance Light. History The park is named after Houghton County Commissioner Frederick J. McLain, an instrumental figure in securing land for the site in the 1930s. Laborers working through the Work Projects Administration (WPA) performed most of the park's construction. A new entrance and contact station were built in 1965, following the relocation of M-203. Activities and amenities While the majority of the shoreline is rocky, a stretch known as \\"the Breakwaters\\" near the Keweenaw Waterway at the park's southern end provides a sandy beach for swimming.

A pur√©e (or mash) is cooked food, usually vegetables, fruits or legumes, that has been ground, pressed, blended or sieved to the consistency of a creamy paste or liquid. Pur√©es of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus. The term is of French origin, where it meant in Old French (13th century) purified or refined. Pur√©es overlap with other dishes with similar consistency, such as thick soups, creams (cr√®mes) and gravies‚Äîalthough these terms often imply more complex recipes and cooking processes. Coulis (French for \\"strained\\") is a similar but broader term, more commonly used for fruit pur√©es. The term is not commonly used for paste-like foods prepared from cereal flours, such as gruel or muesli; nor with oily nut pastes, such as peanut butter. The term \\"paste\\" is often used for pur√©es intended to be used as an ingredient, rather than eaten. Pur√©es can be made in a blender, or with special implements such as a potato masher, or by forcing the food through a strainer, or simply by crushing the food in a pot. Pur√©es generally must be cooked, either before or after grinding, in order to improve flavour and texture, remove toxic substances, and/or reduce their water content. It is common to pur√©e entire meals (without use of salt or other additives) to be served to toddlers, babies, and those unable to chew as sufficient, nutritious meals.

It was developed in the mid-1980s by Rod MacGregor, who founded Insignia Solutions. Available originally on UNIX workstations to run MS-DOS, the software was ported to the Macintosh in 1987, and later gained the ability to run Microsoft Windows software. Besides Mac OS, supported platforms included SGI IRIX, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, IBM AIX, NeXTSTEP, Motorola 88000, DEC VAX/VMS, DEC ULTRIX, and others. Bundles of SoftPC with Windows (3.x, 95, 98) were called SoftWindows, although it was possible to install Windows into the basic SoftPC environment along with some special utilities provided by Insignia to achieve the same effect. Beginning in 1996, Insignia commanded the niche for this product area, but it soon faced heavy competition from Connectix with their Virtual PC product. Insignia sold the product line to FWB Software in October 1999 in order to focus on supplying implementations of Java for the mobile device market. FWB continued to sell SoftWindows until March 2001. FWB Software also marketed a separate version of the software that did not include a bundled copy of Windows, called RealPC, until 2003. When Microsoft released Windows NT it included a subsystem (\\"WOW\\" - Windows on Windows, later NTVDM) for running virtualized 16-bit Windows (x86) programs. However, they had also made changes to Windows to allow it to run on alternative processors (Alpha, PowerPC), and for these an emulation layer was needed for programs compiled for Intel processors. Customized versions of Insignia's core emulation system were produced to this end, but the alternative NT architectures never became widely used.

It is based on the fighting game of the same name and its subsequent iterations. The manga was produced prior to the release of Super Street Fighter II and only features the original twelve \\"World Warriors\\". While far from being the only Street Fighter manga, it was one of the earliest and the first of few that was translated in English. It is notable for featuring the first illustrated appearance of Ryu and Ken's sensei, Gouken. Plot summary Ryu and Ken have begun training with the reluctant and mysterious legend Gouken. One night, Ken's friend Cho appears at the dojo in a panic, revealing that he has learned of M. Bison's organization, Shadaloo, and its current agenda‚Äîvicious human experiments revolving around a drug called Doll which effectively brainwashes people, usually for acts of violence. Cho has been followed and falls victim to an attack by Bison and two of his lords of Shadaloo, Vega and Sagat. Naturally, a fight ensues, during which the groups of combatants become separated. After making his way back to the dojo, Ryu finds that Gouken has been left for dead by Bison, and hears his master's final words. Assuming the missing Ken to be dead also, Ryu becomes a lonesome vagabond. Years later, Doll has had an effect on the lives of a soldier named Guile and an Interpol officer named Chun-Li who have arrived on Shad and entered its martial-arts tournament in respective efforts to investigate Shadaloo and reach Bison, who has become the tournament's champion. Ryu, now a more capable fighter, has also emerged on Shad and entered the tournament, while befriending Cho's old girlfriend Po-Lin and her little brother Wong-Mei, who have been recently orphaned and manage their family's Chinese restaurant. As the fighting progresses over the course of a few days, Ryu, Guile, and Chun-Li advance, facing opponents such as Blanka, E. Honda, Dhalsim, and Zangief some of whom have personal goals of their own. Ryu and Chun-Li form a loose affinity, and following a moment in which Chun-Li suddenly comes across Po-Lin with Ryu and appears jealous, Ryu sees a picture in the paper of an upcoming participant in the tournament and from there realizes that Ken is indeed alive. At the tournament, Chun-Li and Guile begin losing to Vega and Sagat, with Guile still not fully recovered from his match with Zangief, and Chun-Li partly hindered by rage. During the battles, an emotionally conflicted Ken starts to snap out of Doll's influence. Eventually, a weary Chun-Li begins to recall the advice she's received from her father and Ryu respectively, regains control of herself, and surprises Vega with a powerful Kikoken a moment before he can land the finishing strike. Guile, meanwhile, is still faring poorly against Sagat, before being saved by intervention from none other than Ken, who's regained his senses. While the new fight plays out, Guile and Chun-Li lay nearly unconscious in the backroom infirmary, only to be approached by a henchman of Bison's sent to finish them off. But before he can complete his attack, he is blasted into a wall and knocked senseless by a Hadouken, and a still-weary Chun-Li reaches out upon looking up and noticing that Ryu has arrived. After overcoming Sagat, Ken is set to fight in the next day's final match, but soon confronts Bison backstage in a hallway, seeking to take his anger out on him immediately. He is stopped, however, by Ryu, whom Ken is relieved to find alive. However Bison uses his power to control Ken via Doll again and orders him to fight Ryu. The fight stops when Ryu ceases fighting and tells Ken to resist Doll and Bisons orders. Ken has a flashback of his years under Gouken with Ryu and snaps out of it in the middle of a Shoryuuken. He manages to turn the attack away from Ryu and smashes his hand into a wall. With his hand broken, Ken asks Ryu to take his place in the tournament's finale against Bison. Ryu agrees, and after an emotional battle witnessed by many, including notable Street Fighters and several of the people who have been affected by Shadaloo over the years, Ryu emerges victorious. As it ends, a jump forward at some point in the future reveals that many of the friends and participants have parted ways or begun doing so. A narrative by Chun-Li implies that both Doll's time and Shadaloo's control over Shad have passed. Ryu departs once more, leaving Ken, Po-Lin, and Wong-Mei as he sets off on a journey.

They are a pastiche of the Avengers from the Marvel Comics universe. They were created by Mike Friedrich and Dick Dillin in the pages of Justice League of America #87 February (1971). Origins The team was introduced in Justice League of America #87 (February 1971), written by Mike Friedrich and published at the same time as his friend Roy Thomas was introducing the Justice League pastiche Squadron Supreme in Avengers. They came from the alien planet of Angor. When Angor was attacked by a spacefaring robot, they defeated it, and tracked it back to its home planet. At the same time, the JLA was tracking a robot which attacked Earth. The two teams both assumed the other was the enemy, and fought. The Champions of Angor in this story were: *Wandjina: The team leader. Named after an Australian weather spirit, he has super-strength and weather control powers; imitation of Thor. *Silver Sorceress (civilian identity later revealed as Laura Cynthia Neilsen): A powerful, but unpredictable, magic user, with a costume incorporating a curious headdress; imitation of the Scarlet Witch. *Blue Jay (civilian identity later revealed as Jay Abrams): Hero with the ability to shrink in size, and fly; imitation of Yellowjacket. *Jack B. Quick (civilian identity later revealed as Harry Christos; later takes the name Captain Speed): Speedster with brief flight abilities; imitation of Quicksilver. Current status The team later appeared in Keith Giffen's post-Crisis Justice League International. In #2 Wandjina, Blue Jay and the Sorceress came to Earth in order to destroy all nuclear weapons. Apparently they are the only survivors of a nuclear disaster that wiped out Angor. Their teammate, Captain Speed, died later of radiation poisoning.Justice League #2 (June 1987) Wandjina sacrifices himself to prevent a meltdown in a Bialyan reactor, and the others give themselves up to the Russian authorities. Wandjina's corpse would later be reanimated as a weapon by Queen Bee of Bialya. The citizens didn't quite understand the fate of Wandjina and came to revere him as a hero.Captain Atom Annual #2 (1998) Justice League Europe #15 (June 1990) began a story in which the Sorceress and Blue Jay escaped from prison. Blue Jay went to the League for help, while the Sorceress returned to Angor. A flashback revealed that the nuclear disaster was caused by a group of villains called the Extremists. The Extremists captured the Sorceress and made her take them to Earth, where they again attempted to seize control of the world's nuclear weapons. It was eventually revealed that (with one exception) these were robot duplicates of the Extremists, created for an amusement park. The owner of the amusement park was sent to Earth and switched them off. The remaining villain, Dreamslayer, was defeated by the Sorceress. Blue Jay and the Silver Sorceress joined the Justice League Europe. Justice League Quarterly #3, Mike McKone (1991) Justice League Quarterly #3 (1990) featured Mitch Wacky (the amusement park owner) travelling back in time to prevent the Extremists from destroying Angor. This story introduced more members of the team (now called the Justifiers), including: *The Bowman - A womanizing archer, with a tendency to go for \\"black widow types\\". Pastiche of Hawkeye. First appeared in one panel of the \\"Extremist Vector\\" storyline in Justice League Europe #15-18. Subsequent appearances include \\"When You Wish...\\" in Justice League Quarterly #3, the \\"With a Vengeance!\\" storyline in Superman/Batman #20-24, and in the new Lord Havok and the Extremists series. *Tin Man - An armored hero with a heart condition. Pastiche of Iron Man. *T.A. - A heroine with metal wings. Pastiche of Wasp. *Bug - A pastiche of Spider-Man that appears as a hero in Justice League Quarterly #3 and as a villain in \\"With a Vengeance!\\" In 2008's Final Crisis event, a team called the Justifiers are controlled by the Anti-Life Equation, and now \\"justify\\" Darkseid's rule of the Earth. Other versions =Lord Havok and The Extremists= In the new Lord Havok and The Extremists series (2007), new versions of the Champions are featured on Earth-8. They are now part of a group called the Meta-Militia with Tin Man as president of Angor and Americommando as vice president. When Tin Man is killed by Lord Havok, Americommando becomes president with Blue Jay as his vice President. Americommando is sleeping with T.A. behind Blue Jay's back. Blue Jay eventually turns against Americommando, the latter having forged an alliance with Monarch, arrests him for crimes against humanity, and takes his place as president. Wandjina is also featured, now a closeted homosexual. During a battle between the Meta-Militia and the Extremists, he is swallowed whole by Gorgon. =The New 52: Earth 7 and Earth 8= Two versions of the Champions of Angor are introduced in the first issue of Grant Morrison's The Multiversity series. In the DC Multiverse following its The New 52 reboot, Earth-7 and Earth-8 are sister worlds, representing pastiches of the Ultimate Marvel imprint and the mainstream Marvel Comics universe respectively. In the beginning of The Multiversity, a terrible evil comes to Earth-7 and utterly destroys it, leaving its only hero as Thor analogue Thunderer (whose closest counterpart is Wundajin of Earth-8). While Earth 8 continues to feature Lord Havok, the Champions of Angor are replaced by The Rampaging Retaliators, themselves an Avengers pastiche whose \\"Retaliators ready!\\" echoes the latter's rallying cry of \\"Avengers assemble!\\". The other residents of Earth-8 include: * The Future Family, a pastiche of the Fantastic Four. Led by Frank Future, a pastiche of Mister Fantastic; Lord Havok claims to be his \\"greatest creation\\" * The G-Men, \\"neo-humans\\" and a pastiche of the X-Men * American Crusader, a pastiche of Captain America and member of the Retaliators * Wundajin, a pastiche of Thor with a \\"lightning axe\\" who is identical in appearance to the Champions of Angor's Wandjina and is a member of the Retaliators * Behemoth, a pastiche of the Incredible Hulk who grows into a giant blue infant when angered and is known as Dr. David Dibble when in human form; a member of the Retaliators * Machinehead, a pastiche of Iron Man and member of the Retalitors * Ladybug, a pastiche of Spider-Woman and member of the Retaliators * The Bug, a pastiche of Spider-Man, known as \\"The Hero You Hate to Love\\" * Kite, a pastiche of Falcon * Deadeye, a pastiche of Hawkeye * Red Dragon, a pastiche of Black Widow * Major Max, a pastiche of Captain Marvel * Stuntmaster, a pastiche of Daredevil See also *The Maximums, another team of Avengers (specifically the Ultimates and New Avengers) pastiches in the DCU *Squadron Supreme, a Marvel Comics pastiche of the Justice League References Avengers (comics) Characters created by Dick Dillin Characters created by Mike Friedrich Comics characters introduced in 1971 Extraterrestrial superheroes ","title":"Champions of Angor"},{"id":"3508955","text":"Former MTA Capital Construction President Michael Horodniceanu MTA Capital Construction is a subsidiary agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), formed in July 2003 to manage the MTA's major capital projects in the New York metropolitan area.

First described by Walter Rothschild in 1902, it was long considered a subspecies of the masked booby until recognised as distinct genetically and behaviorally in 2002. It has a typical sulid body shape, with a long pointed orange-yellow bill, long neck, aerodynamic body, long slender wings and pointed tail. The adult is bright white with black and white wings, a black tail and a dark face mask. Taxonomy Walter Rothschild organised and sent an expedition to the Galapagos Islands in 1897 to collect and review the animal life there. He wrote of a distinctive booby there, which he and William Robert Ogilvie-Grant diagnosed as the Peruvian booby (Sula variegata), then only known from juvenile plumage. Later, in 1902, Rothschild named it a new species, Sula granti. Rothschild later reclassified as a subspecies of the masked booby. In 1998, Pitman and colleagues observed that Nazca boobies on Clipperton Island did not interbreed with masked boobies there. The genus Sula was previously placed in the order Pelecaniformes, but recently was collected in the family Sulidae and order Suliformes, together with 8 other genera. The Nazca booby was considered conspecific with the masked booby but was reassigned to a separate species based on mitochondrial DNA analyses. It is likely to have diverged 400,000-500,000 years ago. Description The species has a yellow iris, orange and pinkish beak, black facial skin in the form of a mask, and grey feet. Adults present white plumage with black tips of the wings and tail. The female is bigger and heavier than the male, has a slightly differently colored beak, and squawks while the male whistles. Chicks are snow white and fluffy, plumage changing to grey along with beak and feet upon fledging. Distribution and habitat The species occurs in the eastern Pacific from the islands in Baja California to the Gal√°pagos Islands and the Isla de la Plata in Ecuador and Malpelo in Colombia. Ecology =Feeding= The Nazca booby preys on small fish caught by diving at high speed from flight into the ocean. The main food species is South American pilchard, but also take flying fish, anchovies and squid, specially during the El Ni√±o events, when sardine numbers are low. Because of their sexual dimorphism, females tend to feed on bigger prey and dive deeper. =Reproduction= The Nazca booby nests near cliffs on bare ground with little to no vegetation. The male chooses and defends a territory, then enters into courtship to attract females. Like many seabirds, the species has a long lifespan combined with low annual reproduction and long periods of development in the young. Clutch size is one or two eggs, due to the low hatching success, however when 2 eggs are laid and they both hatch, it is common for only one of the chicks to survive. While many species of birds regulate egg temperature via an incubation patch, a layer of bare skin that allows birds to transmit heat into their eggs, the Suliformes instead use the skin on their webbed feet in addition to heat transferred from the breast. The feet are heavily vascularized, especially during the nesting period. Both the male and the female show parental care. Usually the chick that hatches first is bigger and becomes aggressive towards its sibling, excluding it from feeding and eventually starving it. The energy investment on the parent's part is very high, so their metabolic rates change during the nesting season. This causes both parents to lose similar amounts of body weight and suffer a decline in their immune system activity. This adjustment does not take place when the parents decide not to nest, a decision that is mostly driven by food availability, which in turn depends on ocean current and climate patterns such as those driven by the El Ni√±o oscillation. Siblicide has been well studied in this species; the first chick is born around five days before the second and is larger and stronger by the time the second is born. It drags its younger sibling out of the nest. Field experiments in the Galapagos demonstrated that the boobies can manage to feed two chicks without too much difficulty. This raises questions as to the origin of the phenomenon.Anderson, David J. 1990. \\"Evolution of Obligate Siblicide in Boobies 1. A Test of the Insurance-Egg Hypothesis.\\" The American Naturalist 135, vol. 3: 334-350 =Parasites= The vampire ground finch sometimes feeds on the blood of the Nazca booby. Conservation The Nazca booby is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. Although populations are thought to decrease to some extent, this decline is not strong enough to require classification in a threat category. Some of the factors that influence the decrease of populations are overfishing and marine pollution.

Physical features of the park include the Ivindo River, the park is the main tributary to the Ogoou√©, and Mount Kingu√© (749 m) and Mount Ngouadi (870 m). Average rainfall is 1672 mm, with peaks in rainfall between September and December, and February and May. Violent thunderstorms occur seasonally, and can sometimes generate localised tornadoes, especially on the Ipassa Plateau; the disturbances caused by this effect may be responsible for the fact that this forest superficially resembles secondary forest. Average temperature is 23.9 ¬∞C (measured at Makokou a few kilometres from the northern park border), with seasonal variation of around 3.3 ¬∞C. The park covers 300,000 ha, almost all of which is forested with a mixture of Atlantic coastal forest of Lower Guinea, and semi- deciduous forest typical of central Congo Basin. Wildlife includes western lowland gorilla, common chimpanzee, African forest buffalo, red river hog, sitatunga, as well as one of the last relativity intact populations of forest elephants. Notable bird species include grey-necked rockfowl, while more than 430 bird species have been recorded within the park. Since 2001, before the park's creation, the WCS has studied and protected the southern region of the park, concentrated at Langou√© Bai, with the support of what is now the Gabonese National Parks Agency (ANPN). In 2004 WCS constructed a purpose-built camp 3 km from Langou√© Bai, with accommodation and offices for researchers, providing important insights into bai ecology and a protective presence against poachers.

At the time of First Quench's closure, these included the Threshers, Haddows, The Local and Wine Rack chains. Its head office was based in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. On 29 October 2009 it was announced that the company had gone into administration. History Threshers branch in Petersfield in 2008. Haddows branch in Port Glasgow during closing-down sale in late 2009. The company was originally formed as First Quench Retailing by the merger of the Whitbread owned Threshers and the Allied Domecq owned Victoria Wine in August 1998. This brought together the 1,470 Thresher Wine Shop, Drinks Cabin, Wine Rack, \\"Bottoms Up\\" and Huttons brands with around 1,500 Victoria Wine, Wine Cellar, Haddows, Martha's Vineyard, and The Firkin. Allied Domecq later sold their 50% of the company to Punch Taverns in September 1999. In November 1991, Threshers, then owned by Whitbread alone, had bought the Peter Bottomfield Dominic Group from Grand Metropolitan for ¬£50m. The Bottoms Up brand of shops, formerly owned by Peter Bottomfield Dominic, was retained. Peter (Bottomfield) Dominic was separated from GrandMet's IDV group in 1989 to become a retail division. At time of the merger, the company employed around 20,000 people and claimed to account for around 13% of the take home drinks market ‚Äì Tesco, in comparison, claimed around 14%. The number of stores and employees were gradually reduced in the years following, although it remained the largest off-licence chain until the company's demise in 2009. The company's stores were split across several brand focussed trading divisions which were eventually reduced to two. A wine-led division included their premium brand and high wine mix stores, with the 'drinks division' focussed around their convenience driven and drinks-led shops. The company was purchased by the Japanese private equity firm Nomura Holdings in October 2000 for ¬£225m. Terra Firma Capital Partners purchased the company in April 2002. In March 2003 Terra Firma Capital Partners dispensed with the First Quench name and adopted Thresher Group as the overall company identity and trading name ‚Äì First Quench Retailing Limited remained the legal name. In July 2003 the company acquired gourmet meal business Leaping Salmon to attempt exploit the natural links between food and wine. They later experimented rebranding some stores 'Thresher + Food' to offer premium ready meals, but after the experiment proved unsuccessful, those stores were eventually reverted to either the 'Thresher's' or 'Wine Rack' brands. The collapse of rival retailer Unwins led to Threshers buying 200 stores, with the remaining 170 stores closing. The stores were rebranded as either 'The Local', 'Thresher's' or 'Wine Rack'. In June 2007, Thresher Group was sold to the equity company Vision Capital for around ¬£250 million. In 2008 the company reverted to using the First Quench Retailing (FQR) name from Thresher Group. On 29 October 2009 it was announced that First Quench Retailing had entered into administration, and KPMG were appointed administrators. The following day, 81 redundancies were made at the company's head office in Welwyn Garden City. The brand names Thresher's, The Local, Bottoms Up and Victoria Wine were subsequently purchased by Midlands-based newsagent, off-licence and convenience store operator Dave's Discount Group. The Wine Rack brand was purchased by Convivality Plc (at the time registered as Bargain Booze Holdings Limited).

Functions Fender skirts are implemented for both aesthetic and aerodynamic reasons. Rather than air flowing into and being trapped in the rear wheel well, it flows smoothly over the bodywork. They are generally detachable to allow for tire changes and installation of snow chains. Automakers have also experimented with integral front wheel fender skirts, as on the 1949‚Äì1954 Nash \\"Airflyte\\" models and the compact 1950‚Äì1954 Nash Rambler, but with success limited by the fact that the front wheels must pivot for steering, extending out from the side of the vehicle slightly. The 1955 Ford Thunderbird introduced rear \\"fender shields\\" as a type of fender skirts with an edge molding and a gravel shield. In GM parts accessories books, fender skirts are known as fender shields. History First described as \\"pants\\", they were used for the streamlining effect by Frank Lockhart on a 1928 Stutz land speed record attempt car. Factory production of fender skirts began with the 1932 Graham-Paige. Aesthetically streamlined designs were copied to mass-produced models. The innovations introduced by Amos Northup, such as the V'd radiators, fender skirts, and sloping beaver-tails, became common after 1933. However, by the 1970s, fender skirts began to disappear from mass market automobiles. Fender skirts remained for some time longer on a few cars, particularly large American luxury cars. Fender skirts were often paired with whitewall tires. The extent of the skirt also varied, before the 1950s it was common for all but the very bottom of the rear tire to be covered, while by the 1960s fender skirts only covered some of the top of the tire, and were largely absent on cars other than top line models. For example, up until 1976, the Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile 98, Buick Electra, Pontiac Bonneville and the Cadillac Fleetwood, DeVille and Calais models used fender skirts. The Cadillac Eldorado models sported fender skirts from 1971 thru 1974. Starting in 1977 only the Pontiac Bonneville retained the use of fender skirts on General Motors downsized cars. In 1980 the Oldsmobile returned the fender skirts to its 98 model. By 1985, fender skirts would disappear from all standard General Motors cars. In 1989, fender skirts were used again on the Cadillac front wheel drive Fleetwood models until 1993. For the 1991-1996 model years, General Motors generally incorporated fender skirts into the design of their full size sedans for the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster, and Cadillac Fleetwood. The General Motors EV1 had fender skirts later. When making Kustoms, fender skirts are a must accessory to close the rear fenders and add a special kind of sleekness. In European automobile design, Citro√´n notably used fender skirts on nearly all models produced between 1950 and 1990, most prominently in the DS, 2CV, Ami, GS, SM, BX, and CX. As of 2015, the last mass-produced car with fender skirts was the 1999-2006 Honda Insight, although they are available for some new cars as aftermarket accessories (the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Volkswagen Beetle being some examples). Some cities, such as Los Angeles, have fender skirts on municipal buses for safety purposes, as they can prevent items in the road from slipping under the tires. In 2013, the limited production Volkswagen XL1 reintroduced fender skirts on modern cars.

It was internationally syndicated by Bohbot Entertainment. The series was primarily aimed at girls and had two seasons of thirteen episodes each in 1995‚Äì1996. The plot follows the quest of a young princess of Avalon, Gwenevere, and her fellow teenage Jewel Riders, Fallon and Tamara, to find and secure the scattered enchanted jewels so they can use them to stop the evil sorceress Lady Kale from taking over the kingdom, restore harmony in magic, and bring home their banished mentor Merlin. In the second season, the Jewel Riders receive more powers to compete against the returning Kale and the mighty new enemy Morgana for more magical jewels. Jewel Riders is in many ways similar to The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers and both series had the same creator and director, Robert Mandell, as well as some of its writers, notably Christopher Rowley. The series was initially planned as an adaptation of Dragonriders of Pern, came in the wake of Bohbot's earlier take on the Arthurian legend, King Arthur and the Knights of Justice, and shares similarities with the magical girl subgenre of anime and with some American cartoons. Although writers were divided on the show, it was a hit in France and later became the basis for the novel series and upcoming animated series Avalon: Web of Magic.  Plot  =Premise= In the original version of the show, the title character's name resembles that of King Arthur's wife, Guinevere, while other Arthurian characters include Merlin and the Lady of the Lake.Ann F. Howey, Stephen Ray Reimer, A Bibliography of Modern Arthuriana (1500‚Äì2000), 2006 (p. 520).Vincent Terrace, Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 Through 1997, 2008 (p. 1222). The show's action is set in the legendary island of Avalon, here portrayed as a fairy tale-style utopia that keeps its magic in check through the seven Crown Jewels of the Kingdom, each representing an area of the realm. The series takes place a thousand years after the good wizard Merlin's initial victory over the evil queen Morgana. The eponymous Jewel Riders are young female champions of goodness and magical guardians of the city of New Camelot who, mentored by the ageless Merlin and aided by their magic animal friends, have been traditionally upholding the laws of the peaceful land and defending its people for generations. But when a new great menace looms over Avalon, and with their teacher Merlin suddenly gone, the current Jewel Riders are tasked with recovering the mystical Enchanted Jewels that control the dangerous Wild Magic. Avalon's fate rests with the Jewel Riders: the latest incarnation consists of the 16-year-old Princess Gwenevere (Gwen) and her friends, Fallon and Tamara. Their jewels, besides their various unique powers, allow them to \\"ride\\" safely through the tunnels of a dangerous alternate dimension of the Wild Magic, as well as to communicate with their Special Friends ‚Äï the magic animals who each share a similar gemstone in their neck collars. The girls are often assisted by the Pack, an also teenage male trio of wolf-riding Knights of Avalon who wield the Forest Stones, and fight against Lady Kale, the ruthless former princess of Avalon who has vowed to command all the magic and rule the kingdom no matter the consequences. An emphasis is set on the \\"power of friendship\\", which enables the Jewel Riders to overcome evil and to even ultimately befriend some of their would-be enemies. In the second season, the threat to Avalon is not over yet, and gets worse with an introduction of an even more dangerous adversary for the Jewel Riders to thwart. Instead of Crown Jewels, Gwen and her friends seek out another cache of magical gems while still struggling to keep off the forces of darkness and to contain the growing chaos in the magic. = First season = The story is set up during the two-part pilot episode \\"Jewel Quest.\\" Princess Gwenevere, the young daughter of the current rulers of Avalon, Queen Anya and King Jared, is being prepared by Merlin for the day when she will meet a bonded animal friend to share their own themed Enchanted Jewels with. Gwen is yet to be given the magic of the royal Sun Stone, while her best friends Tamara and Fallon already wield the magic of the Moon Stone and the Heart Stone. Gwen needs to search for such an animal and become the new leader of the Jewel Riders, and later succeeds in getting her Special Friend in Sunstar the flying unicorn. Meanwhile, the outlaw Lady Kale, a hateful and power-hungry sister of Anya, gets hold of the mysterious Dark Stone and uses it to overpower Merlin, sending him into the perilous dimension of Wild Magic. Kale steals the Crown Jewels and plans to use their magic to take over Avalon and reign forever, but Merlin foils her by breaking their setting and sending them back to the lands from where they had come, scattering them wide across the kingdom and beyond. Unfortunately, once the Crown Jewels' bond is broken, magic is no longer stable and flows out of control, causing dangerous outbreaks until they are brought back together. Retrieving them is the only way the Riders can free Merlin from being lost in the limbo of Wild Magic and so their titular quest begins. Using the magic of the Enchanted Jewels and their friendship, the Jewel Riders must prevent Kale from gaining more power, reclaim the Crown Jewels, and save Merlin and all of Avalon. The primary storyline tells of the Jewel Riders' adventures in their efforts to locate and secure each of the Crown Jewels before Kale can get her hands on them or to win them back if she does. The seven Crown Jewels consist of the Jewel of the North Woods (in \\"Travel Trees Can't Dance\\"), the Rainbow Jewel found inside the Rainbow Falls (in \\"Song of the Rainbow\\"), the Jewel of the Burning Ice found in the Hall of Wizards at the Wizard's Peak in the snow- covered mountains (in \\"Wizard's Peak\\"), the Misty Rose Jewel found in the Misty Moors (in \\"For Whom the Bell Trolls\\"), the Desert Star Jewel of the Great Desert found in the magical realm of Faeryland (in \\"The Faery Princess\\"), the Jewel of the Dreamfields (in \\"Dreamfields\\"), and the Jewel of the Jungle found in the hidden lair of the legendary wizard Morgana (in \\"Revenge of the Dark Stone\\"). During the two-part dramatic finale of the first season (in \\"Revenge of the Dark Stone\\" and \\"Full Circle\\"), Kale succeeds in seizing control of the Jewel Keep at the Crystal Palace. Becoming seemingly invincible, she overthrows Anya, unleashes the dark magic onto Avalon, strips the Jewel Riders of their powers, and prepares to make herself a queen for eternity. Kale seeks out Merlin to finish him off, but he uses his remaining powers to pull her into the Wild Magic and holds her there long enough for the girls to release the magic of the Crystal Palace, revealed as the greatest Enchanted Jewel in Avalon. Unaware of this, Kale attempts to absorb the powers of the gathered Crown Jewels and ends up being destroyed and all the dark magic is undone. The girls then discover that they have tuned the Crown Jewels to their personal jewels, enabling them to channel all the magic of Avalon. In doing so, however, they squandered a chance of solving the magic crisis for good, as well as a chance of freeing Merlin, who has given up his staff jewel so Kale could be defeated. = Second season = The Jewel Riders realize that the Crown Jewels have given them a set of new 'Level Two' armor and magic seven times more powerful than before. They girls now have at their disposal far greater magic than they ever dreamed possible; they also find it difficult to use. Meanwhile, inside the Wild Magic, Lady Kale's Dark Stone is summoned toward a floating palace, where she re-materializes and meets her accidental rescuer, the legendary Morgana, creator and original wielder of the Dark Stone. Morgana had led the other ancient wizards against Merlin a millennium ago but failed and, having lost her jewel, has remained trapped in the Wild Magic ever since. United only by their mutual hatred for Merlin, the two grudgingly decide to team up as Morgana sends Kale back to Avalon in search for the other Wizard Jewels in a preparation for her own return. The Jewel Riders need to master their enhanced jewel powers while they continue their quest to bring Merlin home, especially since soon they confront Morgana and realize that they are facing a very dangerous new enemy. The seven Wizard Jewels are just as hard to obtain as the Crown Jewels were, as they are scattered in magical places beyond Avalon. Through most of the season the Riders try to find the jewels before they fall into the hands of Morgana, who wants to use their magic to complete her conquest of the kingdom; at the same time, Kale also seeks the Wizard Jewels for herself while supposedly working for/with Morgana. The seven Wizard Jewels consist of the Unicorn Jewel (in \\"Vale of the Unicorns\\"), the Jewel of Arden (in \\"Prince of the Forest\\"), the Garden Jewel (in \\"The Wizard of Gardenia\\"), the Jewel of the Sea (in \\"The Jewel of the Sea\\"), the Time Stone (in \\"Mystery Island\\"), and the Fortune Jewel (in \\"The Fortune Jewel\\"), not counting the Dark Stone itself. Princess Gwenevere meets a handsome, mysterious young man called Ian (a werewolf-like individual who later comes to her rescue her during the final battle), falling in love with him. Tamara gains a magical animal for herself, which turns out to be a strange striped unicorn named Shadowsong. The deciding battle between the forces of light and dark ensues during the series' two-part conclusion (in \\"Lady of the Lake\\" and \\"The One Jewel\\"), set in the Heart of Avalon. There, Gwen is given the magic Staff of Avalon by the Lady of the Lake (the Spirit of Avalon), which she then uses to vanquish Kale and to save her friends. In the final showdown, the Riders and their friends band together to battle Morgana in a test of skills and wits over the collected Wizard Jewels. Eventually, the princess fuses the Dark Stone with the Sun Stone and captures the ultimate One Jewel forged from all the Wizard Jewels, which the freed Merlin then uses to get rid of Morgana, the ancient wizards' ghosts, and the dark magic once and for all.  Characters  The titular trio of teenage Jewels Riders consist of Gwenevere/Starla, and her friends Fallon and Tamara. Each of their jewels has different magical abilities and their own colors and corresponding gemstones of various powers, besides also allowing them to communicate with their animals: *The blonde, adventurous and romantic Princess Gwenevere (voiced by Kerry Butler in the first season and Jean Louisa Kelly in the second season), the show's titular main heroine, is the daughter of Queen Anya and King Jared and the future queen of Avalon.

She is aided by her animals: Grimm the dragon (voiced by Peter Fernandez) and a duo of small dragon-weasel creatures named Rufus and Twig (voiced by John Beach and Henry Mandell, respectively).

Episodes =Season 1 (1995)= The show's action is set in the legendary island of Avalon, here portrayed as a fairy tale style kingdom utopia that keeps its magical energies in check by the seven Crown Jewels, each representing a different area of the realm. The series takes place after a thousand years passed since the good wizard Merlin's initial victory over the witch queen Morgana. In the original version of the show, the title character has her name similar with Arthur's wife, Guinevere; other Arthurian characters in the show include Merlin and Lady of the Lake.Ann F. Howey, Stephen Ray Reimer, A Bibliography of Modern Arthuriana (1500-2A91667), 2006 (p. 520)Vincent Terrace, Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 Through 1997, 2008 (p. 1222).Bert Olton, Arthurian Legends on Film and Television, 2008 (p. 239-240). Mentored by the ageless Merlin, the Jewel Riders are the young female champions of goodness and magical guardians of New Camelot, who uphold the laws of the peaceful land and defend its people for generations. But with their teacher Merlin suddenly gone, the trio of current of Jewel Riders, the kingdom's traditional adolescent girl defenders aided by their animal friends, get tasked with recover the mystical Enchanted Jewels that are essential for controlling the dangerous wild magic. Avalon's fate rests with the Jewel Riders, the latest incarnation of which consists of the 16-year-old Princess Gwenevere (Gwen) and her friends, Fallon and Tamara. Along the way, the protagonists must contend with Gwen's evil aunt Lady Kale, a ruthless sorceress who has vowed to control all the magic and rule Avalon no matter the consequences. An emphasis is set on the \\"power of friendship\\", which enables the Jewel Riders to overcome their adversaries. =Season 2 (1995‚Äì96)= In the second season, the threat to Avalon is not over yet and it gets worse with an introduction of an even more dangerous adversary for the Jewel Riders to thwart. Instead of Crown Jewels, Gwen and her friends seek out another cache of magical gems while still struggling to fight off the forces of darkness and to contain the growing chaos in the magic.  History  = Development = Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders was produced by the New York-based studios New Frontier Entertainment and Enchanted Camelot Productions for Bohbot Productions (later BKN) in 1995.Hal Erickson, Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 2005 (p. 642-643). The series was produced by much of the team behind the late 1980s science fiction cartoon The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers, including the creator, co-writer and main director of both shows, Robert Mandell, after a long development process. Despite a similar theme and title, there are no connections with King Arthur and the Knights of Justice, which was Bohbot Entertainment's other Arthurian-inspired cartoon series that was produced in 1992‚Äì1993. It was originally supposed to be a cartoon adaptation of the Dragonriders of Pern series of fantasy novels by Anne McCaffrey but eventually went in a different direction. The series was renamed repeatedly in the course of its development, including to Enchanted Jewel Riders sometime in late 1994 or early 1995 and Princess Guinevere & Her Jewel Adventures in March 1995,Bohbot kids show renamed. (Bohbot Communications renames Enchanted Camelot to Princess Guinevere and Her Jewel Adventures, licenses characters to Hasbro and Hallmark Cards), Broadcasting & Cable, February 27, 1995. before ultimately becoming Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders (which was again retitled as Starla & the Jewel Riders for the export version). One of the several work-in-progress titles for the show was Enchanted Camelot, which was acquired as such in March 1994 by LIVE Entertainment (along with Skysurfer Strike Force and Highlander: The Animated Series).Billboard, 11 February 1995.LIVE Entertainment Inc. announces 1994 results; profitable fourth quarter, Business Wire, March 22, 1995.Enchanted Camelot debuts next year from Bohbot, Playthings Vol. 92 Issue 3 (March 1994), p48. Enchanted Camelot had some major differences in its character design. The August 1994 draft script for the pilot episode of Enchanted Camelot (\\"Enchanted Quest\\", which would become \\"Jewel Quest\\") was different in many aspects. According to The Buffalo News, \\"the production team intended for the Jewel Riders to serve as positive role models for girls.\\"Buffalo News, September 10, 1995. Bohbot's press kit for the series described it as \\"classic story-telling,\\" incorporating \\"strong themes of friendship, teamwork, responsibility and conflict resolution.\\" Each episode was constructed as an animated minimusical. The animation work on the series was done in Taiwan by Hong Ying Animation; one of the show's character designers was the future Emmy Award winner Rob Davies. The overall design was done by Jane Abbot, with Billy Zeats and Greg Autore serving as art directors. Enrico Casarosa was one of the storyboard artists. It was the first series scored by Louis Fagenson; though the French version's soundtrack was the work of Julie Zenatti. The show's CGI effects were created by Ian Tetrault in Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe After Effects. The actress for Gwenevere/Starla was changed for the second season because Kerry Butler had to go to Canada for the musical Beauty and the Beast. The series was not renewed for 1997, but there were originally rumors about a third season being planned for 1998. The series' art director Greg Autore said about the making of the second season: \\"Bohbot wanted European distribution which required 26 [episodes]. So they made the next 13. They would have made more but were waiting to see how it succeeded. When the second set of episodes was turned on, the only two directions to start with were ‚Äì 1) Search for wild magic jewels since the first set was all found 2) Use Morgana as the ultimate villainess instead of Lady Kale. Fortunately, director Robert Mandell was open to many of my suggestions. That second season had many episodes that grew from my concepts and a very rough storyline suggestion. Since the second season were not yet written and were rushed into production, this was where I had the most fun. Instead of just translating the characters and creating new fashions, I was free to create many new powers and adventures for the show. While I had input on many of the first episodes, I was now creating the basic storylines for entire episodes. Robert always had Morgana in the back of his head as a villainess he wanted to do. Now we could break out and expand the world of Avalon in different ways.\\" = Release = The show was first broadcast in the United States in 1995‚Äì1996 on Bohbot Entertainment's \\"Amazin'!

However, according to Variety, Bohbot \\"took the Princess Gwenevere concept to Hasbro Toys, which after extensive market research, put itself enthusiastically behind the project, collaborating in equal partnership with Bohbot on the development of the property.\\"Michael Fisher, \\"Toy-toon marriage an evolving union\\", Variety, June 20, 1995. A national \\"Watch and Win\\" contest in February 1996 offered viewers the opportunity to win Princess Gwenevere videos and toys if they mailed in the correct code words from the show.

Rob Bricken of Topless Robot ranked Princess Gwenevere fifth on his 2009 list of \\"most ridiculous\\" adaptations of Arthurian legend, commenting that shows like that \\"were clearly made to take advantage of a small, low-aiming school of girl-oriented action cartoons, but it ultimately lost out to a slightly more tolerable Japanese import.\\"Rob Bricken, The 10 Most Ridiculous Adaptations of Arthurian Legend, Topless Robot, March 18, 2009.

On the other hand, France's Fun Radio included it among the 14 \\"probably the best\\" cartoons of the 1990s. Alan and Barbara Lupack opined in King Arthur in America that the show, \\"with its strong female heroine, is interesting in part because it is designed primarily for girls\\".Alan Lupack, Barbara Tepa Lupack, King Arthur in America, 2001 (p. 326). Bustle's Lucia Peters wrote, \\"Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders followed a pretty classic 'special kid and special friends have awesome powers and must defeat the forces of darkness' format. The fact that it met at the intersection of horses, sparkly things, and girl power, though, means that it holds a special place in many '90s kids' hearts.\\" Some noted the show for its positive values. According to Billboard, \\"there are life lessons to be learned along the way, and the program in general promotes brains over brawn\\".Billboard, January 20, 1996 (p. 71). Similarly, Keith Busby wrote in Arthurian Literature that \\"the series appeals to young girls and teaches them the values of friendship\\".Keith Busby, Arthurian Literature XVIII, 2001 (p. 250). Marshal Honorof of Tom's Guide described it as similar to the 1980s Dungeons & Dragons cartoon in being \\"a traditional swords-and-sorcery adventure with stand-alone episodes and an emphasis on making kids laugh rather than bogging them down with the dour intrigue or blood-soaked combat of most medieval fantasy stories.\\" In 2018, Syfy's Brittany Vincent wrote that the show had been a \\"perfect fodder for young girls like me looking for strong women and heroes to imitate\\" and called it \\"a pleasant and kitschy relic of the past.\\"  See also  *Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld *Lady Lovely Locks *LoliRock *Star vs. the Forces of Evil *Steven Universe *Tenko and the Guardians of the Magic *W.I.T.C.H. *Wildfire *Winx Club *Wonder Woman and the Star Riders Notes References =In- line= =Other sources= * Enchanted Jewel Riders Show Bible. * Full Production Credits at NYTimes.com. * Jewel Riders at Super3 channel's website. * Kevin J.

The name \\"Gustin Gang\\" came from a street in South Boston (\\"Southie\\"), which was off of Old Colony Avenue, not from the name of any \\"members.\\" Google Map Originally formed by Frank Wallace with his brother Steve during the mid 1910s, the gang first came to prominence in Southie as the \\"Tailboard Thieves,\\" often looting and hijacking delivery trucks while stopped at intersections. Although largely organized by Frank, the gang was enforced by ex-boxer Steve Wallace. They were later joined by younger brother Jim. The brothers committed hijackings and armed robbery throughout the rest of the decade. During the 1920s, Frank Wallace and his brothers would frequently be arrested on charges including larceny, trespassing, gaming, assault and battery, and breaking and entering. However, due to their local political influence (one of their attorneys was John W. McCormack, who was then a state senator, and later Speaker of the United States House of Representatives), they were rarely convicted, and spent relatively little time in prison. Frank is reported to have been arrested more than 25 times, but only served time twice, at Deer Island House of Correction, in 1919 and 1928. Steve served two years at Deer Island in 1934 for conspiring to kill a police officer. (Sweeney, Emily, 2012). Compared to other bootleggers such as Dan Carroll, the Gustins held less resources upon their entry into bootlegging. They eventually owned a few boats (known as rumrunners) that they ran into international waters to pick up alcohol, and then landed the shipments at various points around the Southie shore. They often delivered it themselves to customers, possibly including older brother Billy Wallace's Old Colony Avenue speakeasy, known as The Sportlight, (later, Kelley's Cork N Bull and now Stadium). Eventually they turned to hijacking. Using false badges similar to those used by Prohibition agents, they easily confiscated alcohol shipments from rival bootleggers which they themselves later sold off. On Dec. 22, 1931, after several trucks had been hijacked by members of the Gustins, Frank Wallace and his lieutenant Bernard \\"Dodo\\" Walsh were killed in an ambush, after agreeing to a sit-down with Italian-American gangsters, by Joe Lombardo of the North End, at the C.K. Importing Company, 317 Hanover St. Although the gang retained its power within the city under Stephen Wallace, infighting between the various factions of Irish gangs would eventually see the Italian-American gangsters establish themselves as a dominant criminal organization.

It is measured from . The station is the current terminus of the Riviera Line from Exeter and is also an interchange station between National Rail services and the preserved Dartmouth Steam Railway. History The old goods shed is now used as the ticket office. The railway to Paignton was built by the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway, opening to passengers on 2 August 1859 and extended to Brixham Road station on 14 March 1861. Goods traffic was handled at Paignton from 1 April 1861. The Dartmouth and Torbay Railway was always operated by the South Devon Railway and was amalgamated with it on 1 January 1872. This was only short lived as the South Devon Railway was in turn amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1876. The single-track line had been built using the broad gauge, but on 20 May 1892 was converted to standard gauge. On 11 July 1904, GWR road motor services started running from here to Torquay, in competition with recently extended Torquay Tramways; the land opposite the station is still used as a bus station. The line from was finally doubled in 1910 when the platforms were extended to accommodate longer trains. Further expansion came in 1924 with the opening of a larger booking office and new canopies were erected over the platforms. A few years later the double track was extended to Goodrington, new carriage sidings opened behind the southbound platform. A new goods shed opened on 1 June 1931 south of the station, which freed the original goods shed to deal with parcels traffic and passengers' luggage, and allowed the platforms to be further extended. Plans in 1937 to move the station onto a new site south near the goods shed, which would have allowed five platforms to be constructed, failed to materialise due to World War II. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways in 1948. In 1956 further carriage sidings were opened at Goodrington, mainly used to handle the heavy traffic on summer Saturdays. The line from Paignton to Kingswear was sold to the Dart Valley Light Railway plc on 30 December 1972, which operated another nearby heritage railway at Buckfastleigh. An independent station alongside the main platform, known as \\"Queens Park\\", was opened to serve the Kingswear trains on the site of the carriage sidings opened in 1930. This site includes a shed for the railway's operational engines and carriages. The line has since been transferred to the Dartmouth Steam Railway. The main station building was demolished in 1993 when the booking office was moved into the old goods shed. From December 2004 until December 2009 South West Trains operated a pair of return trains to/from London Waterloo (as extensions of their West of England Main Line trains to Exeter St Davids).\\"West Country - Waterloo - The Real Alternative\\"Travel Watch Southwest RPC report 2005; Retrieved 25 August 2016 (page 9) These were withdrawn at the December 2009 timetable change.GB NRT December 2009 Edition, Table 160 =Signalling= Paignton North Signal Box Two signal boxes were opened in 1889, the 13-lever North Signal Box beside the Torquay Road level crossing, the 17-lever South Signal Box by the Sands Road level crossing. Both were replaced in 1924 by two new boxes. The North box closed on 26 March 1988 when control of trains was transferred to the Panel Signal Box at Exeter but the South box was retained to monitor the two level crossings. In 1990 this function was transferred to a panel in the station buildings and the signal box closed.  Description  The entrance to the Dartmouth Steam Railway The station is sandwiched between two level crossings. At the north (Torquay) end of the station is the busy crossing over Torbay Road. It has a footbridge to allow people to cross the line on foot when the crossing is closed for a train to pass. At the opposite end is the quieter Sands Road crossing, which is used when trains are running on to the carriage sidings or when the heritage line to Kingswear is in operation. Because of this the two lines over this crossing are operated as single tracks with trains running in either direction on both. The main entrance is through the booking office ‚Äì the old goods shed ‚Äì which is constructed from local soft red sandstone. This is on the side furthest from the beach but adjacent to the bus station. The booking office is manned throughout the week (Monday - Friday 08:30 - 17:15, Saturday 08:30 - 16:55, Sunday 10:10 - 16:30), with a self- service ticket machine also in place for use at other times. A shop, photo booth and toilets are also situated in the main building. Train running information is offered via CIS displays, a help point, automatic announcements and timetable poster boards.Paignton station facilities National Rail Enquiries Most trains both arrive and depart from this platform (number 2). If a train is not returning immediately towards Newton Abbot it may arrive at platform 1 and continue over Sands Road Level Crossing into the carriage sidings, returning later to Platform 2. This is because there is no crossover which allows passenger trains to start northwards from Platform 1. It is possible for short trains to shunt out of platform 1 towards Newton Abbot and return to platform 2 when it is vacant. Both platforms have step-free access; passengers unable to use the footbridge are able to pass from one platform to the other over the Torbay Road level crossing at the north end of the platforms. The Dartmouth Steam Railway has its own independent platform and entrance on the south side of the station. Their locomotives are coaled in the shunting neck adjacent to the approach road but the shed is at the far end of the station.  Services  A Riviera Line service Paignton is served by Great Western Railway local trains on an approximately half-hourly basis during the day Monday to Friday. Most trains run to and from Exmouth; on Sundays the service is less frequent. A few long-distance trains also run to/from Paignton. These include Great Western Railway services to London Paddington station and CrossCountry services to Manchester Piccadilly.

The word is used to clarify what is meant when one might otherwise say \\"turn\\". The word \\"turn\\" can be a problem since it means different things in different traditions. For example, in standard chess terminology, one move consists of a turn by each player; therefore a ply in chess is a half-move. Thus, after 20 moves in a chess game, 40 plies have been completed‚Äî20 by white and 20 by black. In the game of Go, by contrast, a ply is the normal unit of counting moves; so for example to say that a game is 250 moves long is to imply 250 plies. The word \\"ply\\" used as a synonym for \\"layer\\" goes back to the 15th century.Online Etymology Dictionary, \\"ply\\" (cited 24 April 2011) Arthur Samuel first used the term in its game-theoretic sense in his seminal paper on machine learning in checkers in 1959,A.L. Samuel, March 3, 1959: Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers (cited 25 August 2006) but with a slightly different meaning: the \\"ply\\", in Samuel's terminology, is actually the depth of analysis (\\"Certain expressions were introduced which we will find useful. These are: Ply, defined as the number of moves ahead, where a ply of two consists of one proposed move by the machine and one anticipated reply by the opponent\\"A.L. Samuel, March 3, 1959: Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers, p. 601 (cited 2 May 2018)). In computing, the concept of ply is important because one ply corresponds to one level of the game tree. The Deep Blue chess computer which defeated Kasparov in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and sixteen plies to a maximum of forty plies in some situations.Murray Campbell, et al. 2002.

The station is now the southern terminus of the Dean Forest Railway. It is located to the south of Lydney, near the A48 road. The diesel department of the preserved line uses Lydney Junction as a base of operations. History A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Lydney Junction Lydney Junction was the name of two separate but adjacent stations on two different railway lines. The Great Western Railway station, which remains open as Lydney railway station, opened in 1851 on the Gloucester to Chepstow section of the South Wales Railway. To the west of this station, the freight-only line of the Severn and Wye Mineral Railway crossed the GWR line on its north-south route taking coal and iron from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Lydney. In 1875, the Severn and Wye started passenger services and built a new terminus station at Lydney Junction for passenger trains to and from Drybrook, near Cinderford. Four years later, this first station was superseded by a new one as the Severn and Wye joined with the Midland Railway in building the Severn Bridge Railway, which linked Lydney across the river Severn with the Midland's Sharpness Branch Line, enabling access for the Forest of Dean minerals to the new and more extensive docks at Sharpness. The new Lydney Junction (Severn and Wye) station was linked by a long footbridge to the GWR's station. It was built on a curve which took the line away to the east from the north-south line of the original freight railway, and there were extensive freight yards, which provided the only rail link between the Severn and Wye and the Great Western lines. The two stations worked closely together, particularly after 1894, when the Severn and Wye Railway was bought by the Great Western and the Midland. Finally, in 1955, under British Railways, the two stations were formally merged into one. Lydney Junction (Severn and Wye) was used as a through-station for passenger services to and from Berkeley Road railway station and over the Severn Railway Bridge. These services either terminated at Lydney Town railway station, which was in the centre of Lydney, or continued on northwards into the Forest of Dean to terminate at Lydbrook Junction on the Ross to Monmouth line. These services ceased abruptly in October 1960 when the Severn Railway Bridge was damaged beyond economic repair in a shipping accident. Passenger services were officially withdrawn in November 1964. Lydney Locomotive Depot in 1962 Revival 73002 sits on static display at the station. After closure, the up platform and the station building were demolished. The down platform survived and forms the basis of the new Lydney Junction station on the heritage Dean Forest Railway. The station was reopened in 1995 when a signal box was opened to supervise a level crossing - the flat-roofed BR timber structure came originally from station in Lancashire. A row of locomotives, including 73002 and 08734, is on static display.

Located in southeast New York in the valley of the Ten Mile River, Wassaic is bordered on the east and west by mountain ranges. The name of the hamlet is derived from the Native American word Washaic; \\"land of difficult access\\" or \\"narrow valley\\". However, Europeans found ready access by following the Housatonic River valley up from Long Island Sound and through the mountains along the Ten Mile River. One of the earliest recorded Europeans to settle in Wassaic was Richard Sackett. He petitioned the Colonial Government on March 11th 1703 for a license to purchase a tract of land in \\"Washiack\\". He was known as Captain Richard Sackett when appointed the first Dutchess County clerk in 1715. By the 1770s Wassaic was processing Ancram pig iron into steel. This continued into the early 1800s, providing steel for the Harris scythe works at Hammertown, near Pine Plains in northern Dutchess. During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington marched through Wassaic on the way to Connecticut. Among Wassaic's main employers in the 19th century were Gridley Iron Works and the Harlem division of the New York and Harlem Railroad. In 1861, Gail Borden opened a factory for producing a condensed milk that would not need refrigeration. This was a welcome ration for the Union troops during the Civil War. Long sold by Borden, it is today marketed as Eagle Brand Condensed Milk. Wassaic was also known for dairy, sheep and grain farming. Wassaic is home to The Wassaic Project, a non-profit arts and music organization and the Wassaic Artist Residency. They provide summer programming as well as run an artist in residence program. Wassaic station is the northernmost station of Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line. The station, once located in the hamlet, has been moved a mile north of it. The station is also the southern access to the Harlem Valley Rail Trail for recreational hiking and biking.

Situated on the east shore of Strangford Lough, a few miles outside the town of Newtownards and near Greyabbey, it was the Irish seat of the Vane-Tempest-Stewart family, Marquesses of Londonderry. The house and its contents reflect the history of the Vane-Tempest-Stewart family, who played a leading role in British and Irish social and political life. History Mount Stewart was formed by the Stewart family (later Vane- Tempest-Stewart), holders of the title Marquess of Londonderry since 1816. The family bought the estate in 1744 with money acquired by Alexander Stewart (1699‚Äì1781). This new wealth came from the sales of materials like linen. At the time, the house was known as Mount Pleasant. Alexander Stewart's son, Robert Stewart, became the first Marquess of Londonderry. In about 1800 he added a temporary wing to the west. He died in 1821 leaving the house to his son, also Robert, better known as Viscount Castlereagh, one of Britain's most famous Foreign Secretaries. Castlereagh lived in Mount Stewart during his childhood until he went to University in Cambridge. Spanish garden Lord Castlereagh inherited his father's title only a year before his own death. The next owner of the house was his half-brother, Charles, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry (1778‚Äì1854). He married twice but it was his later marriage which increased the family's finances greatly. His second wife was Lady Frances Anne Vane-Tempest. She was the greatest heiress of her time. This huge new wealth prompted the refurbishment and enlargement of the newly renamed Mount Stewart. Controversially the Londonderrys, while spending ¬£150,000 on the refurbishment only gave ¬£30 to famine relief in Ireland in the 1840s.University College Cork records on the Irish Famine , ucc.ie; accessed 20 December 2015. This remodelling created the present exterior of Mount Stewart. The small Georgian house and the small portico on the west wing were demolished and the house was increased to eleven bays. On the entrance front, a huge portico was added in the centre, and a smaller 'half portico' was added to the other side. The marriage also brought in much of the Vane-Tempest property, including land. Wynyard Park, County Durham was redesigned in the Neo-classical style. The couple bought Seaham Hall, also in County Durham, and then later bought Holdernesse House on London's Park Lane. This was later renamed Londonderry House. The 4th Marquess of Londonderry married the widow of Viscount Powerscourt and lived at her home, Powerscourt, near Dublin. The 5th Marquess lived at his wife's ancestral property, Plas Machynlleth in Wales, and his son, the 6th Marquess, lived at Wynyard. These long periods of neglect nearly destroyed Mount Stewart. The 7th Marquess (1878‚Äì1949), a well-known Ulster Unionist politician, and his wife brought a new lease of life to the house and its plain grounds. The Marchioness of Londonderry's ancestral home was Dunrobin Castle in Scotland and it was that house's gardens which inspired the Mount Stewart's. She also redesigned and redecorated much of the interior, for example, the huge drawing room, smoking room, the Castlereagh Room and many of the guest bedrooms. She named the latter after European cities including Rome and Moscow. The last chatelaine of the house (and the last surviving child of the 7th Marquess), Lady Mairi Bury (n√©e Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Viscountess Bury), gave the house, and most of its contents to the National Trust in 1977, together with a capital endowment partly funded by the sale in 1977, by Lady Mairi, of Giovanni Bellini's painting \\"The Madonna and Child with a male Donor, a landscape beyond\\" which had hung over the altar in the chapel at Mount Stewart (having formerly been at Londonderry House, London) . Lady Mairi was the last Londonderry family member to live full time at Mount Stewart, and the last member of this Anglo-Irish family to live full time in Ireland. She died at Mount Stewart on 18 November 2009, at the age of 88, in the same four poster bed, hung with red silk damask, that she had been born in.Death of Lady Mairi Bury, scotsman.com; accessed 20 December 2015.

In 1999, the Mount Stewart Gardens were added to the United Kingdom \\"Tentative List\\" of sites for potential nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2015, the National Trust completed an extensive restoration of the house and its contents as well as the purchase of the wider estate re-uniting it and plan to open for visitor access.  House  Mount Stewart was in almost permanent use when the 3rd Marquess was alive and was greatly extended to become the principal family residence. It was increased in size greatly with a collection of new rooms which were suitable to house the family's growing art collections, furnishings and general treasures. The main room was (and still is) the 'Drawing Room'. This looks out onto the main gardens and in the past it would have been possible to see Strangford Lough. Another main entertaining room was the 'Dining Room' which looks out onto the entrance front and was almost twice its present size, but was altered to make a new kitchen some time after its construction and lavish decoration. One of the most stunning rooms at Mount Stewart is the private 'Chapel'. This hidden gem is a double-height room with stained glass windows and Italian paintings on its walls. Gardens The lake at Mount Stewart After the house's interior, the Marchioness redesigned the gardens in the most lavish way possible. Prior to her husband's succession to the Marquessate in 1915 the gardens had been plain lawns with large decorative pots. She added the Shamrock Garden, the Sunken Garden, increased the size of the lake, added a Spanish Garden with a small hut, the Italian Garden, the Dodo Terrace with its 'menagerie' of cement animals, the Fountain Pool and laid out walks in the Lily Wood and rest of the estate.https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/garden-of-the-imagination- lady-londonderrys-mount-stewart- In 1957, she gave the gardens to the National Trust.

It was designed by the neoclassical architect James 'Athenian' Stuart in 1782‚Äì83. Many country houses in the UK had adaptations of the 'temples' their owners had seen on their tours of the Mediterranean. The temple is similar to structures at Shugborough and West Wycombe Park, both National Trust properties. The classical model was the Tower of the Winds, a clocktower in Athens which has a frieze depicting the eight wind deities (anemoi) of Greek mythology.

History RCH map of railways in the vicinity of Lydney Town The station which is situated in the centre of Lydney opened with rather basic facilities on 23 September 1875, these facilities were later upgraded in 1897. The station is located at 8 miles 75 chains from Berkeley Road, located at exactly 1 chain to the north of the station is the High Street level crossing (officially called \\"Lydney Town Crossing\\"). The station's proximity to the main road through Lydney proved to be a problem throughout the station's life as shunting in the nearby yard and in the station caused delays to road and foot traffic. A footbridge was constructed in 1904 in order to reduce the delays to foot traffic. The metal supports for the footbridge and the old platform foundations can still be carefully made out in the undergrowth on the East side of the line between the new platform and the level crossing. All passenger services north of Lydney Town ceased in 1929. The passenger services from Lydney Town to Berkeley Road survived until the destruction of the Severn Railway Bridge in October 1960 when passenger services were suspended.. The station was officially closed in November 1964. The Dean Forest Railway started operating services over Lydney Town Crossing and past the site of the former Lydney Town Station to St Mary's Halt (which was then known as Lydney Lakeside) in 1991. Lydney Town Station was then rebuilt (on a re-aligned track profile due to the amount of urban development and the widening of the High Street) and the subsequently reopened on 22 April 2001.

It rounds out an impressive quartet of courses in the suburbs northeast of Pittsburgh, along with the Longue Vue Club, Oakmont Country Club and the Seth Raynor-designed Fox Chapel Golf Club. Known simply as The Field Club to Pittsburghers, it hosted the PGA Championship in 1937, where Denny Shute successfully defended his match play title. The club also hosted the Western Open in 1959 as part of Pittsburgh's bicentennial celebration. Before he won the U.S. Open in 1953 at nearby Oakmont, Ben Hogan had to qualify for the national championship at the Pittsburgh Field Club, even though he had won three of the previous five. The course was designed by Alexander H. Findlay in August 1914. At the time, Findlay was the premier golf course architect in the country, having perfected his design skills for decades in every corner of the country. The current layout is an amalgam that includes the efforts of Donald Ross, A.W. Tillinghast, Emil \\"Dutch\\" Loeffler, Arthur Hills, Craig Schreiner and Keith Foster in 2012. The first tee next to the clubhouse sits high above the fairway; many members suggest aiming for the white steeple of Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church when you tee off there. Of note is a unique feature to the course layout: An elevator from the 17th green to the 18th tee box. Amenities at the club include: a skeet range, swimming pool, tennis and paddleball courts, privately stocked fishing lake, driving range, practice area, an 18-hole golf course and a full-service restaurant.

Cuse attended Harvard University (class of 1981) and was recruited at freshmen registration by Ted Washburn for the rowing team. In his words, he became \\"a hardcore athlete\\". Cuse's original plan was to attend medical school, but he instead majored in American history.Carlton Cuse By Reed B. Rayman, The Harvard Crimson (6/5/2006). During his junior year at Harvard, Cuse organized a test screening for the makers of the Paramount film Airplane!. The producers wanted to record the audience reaction to time the final cut of the jokes in the film. Cuse said then was when he started thinking about a career in film.15 Questions with A. Carlton Cuse ‚Äô81 By TOBIAS S. STEIN and LOGAN R. URY. The Harvard Crimson, 3/4/2010. Career =Beginnings= Cuse teamed up with a Harvard classmate, Hans Tobeason, and made a documentary about rowing at Harvard called Power Ten. He convinced actor, writer, and fellow Harvard graduate George Plimpton to narrate the film. After graduating, Cuse headed for Hollywood, and worked as an assistant to a studio head, then as a script reader. By working as a reader, he said, he learned screenwriting. In 1984, Cuse took a job working as an assistant producer for Bernard Schwartz and then spent a year and a half working on Sweet Dreams, directed by Karel Reisz, starring Jessica Lange and Ed Harris. He described the experience as his version of film school. Through a friend, David J. Burke, Cuse was hired as a writer on the Michael Mann series Crime Story. In 1986, Cuse wrote two teleplays for the series. =Film= Cuse formed a partnership with feature writer Jeffrey Boam, with whom he helped develop the films Lethal Weapon 2, Lethal Weapon 3, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

Cuse said yes and wrote The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., about a Harvard-educated bounty hunter who wants to avenge the death of his father, the most famous lawman in the Old West. Fox gave the go-ahead for the series. Brisco also had a science-fiction element, in the form of a mysterious orb that appears in several episodes. Boam went back to making features, leaving Cuse to co-create and executive produce the critically acclaimed series. Afterwards, Cuse gave much of the credit for the show's success to actor Bruce Campbell, who played Brisco County, Jr., the lead character. Nash Bridges (1996‚Äì2001) After Brisco, Cuse met Don Johnson, who had a commitment from CBS to make a new series. With Johnson's blessing, Cuse went off and wrote the pilot for Nash Bridges. Johnson liked it and CBS did, too, ordering 14 episodes off the script without making a pilot. Nash Bridges was the first series that Les Moonves greenlit as the head of CBS. It ran for six seasons and 121 episodes.The long 'Lost' interview with Lindelof and Cuse, Part 2: The Squeakquel The Chicago Tribune, January 24, 2010 Martial Law (1998) Cuse created and executive produced the CBS series Martial Law, starring Arsenio Hall and Sammo Hung Kam-Bo, one of martial arts legend Jackie Chan's closest friends and collaborators. Cuse adapted the world of Hong Kong cinema to American television in a story about a Shanghai cop who comes to the LAPD on an exchange program. A team of eight top Chinese stuntmen and coordinators from Hong Kong was hired. Stanley Tong, who had directed many of Jackie Chan's biggest Hong Kong features, directed the pilot. Sammo Hung became the first Chinese actor to star as the lead in an American TV series. Cuse was running both Martial Law and Nash Bridges simultaneously. The workload became creatively and physically difficult, which led to him leaving Martial Law, and focus exclusively on Nash Bridges. Another factor, Cuse said, were creative differences with Sammo Hung about the future direction of Martial Law. Lost (2004‚Äì2010) Cuse at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International Cuse was an executive producer and joint showrunner on Lost with Damon Lindelof. They met during the sixth season of Nash Bridges. Cuse hired Lindelof, giving him his first staff-writer job on a television series. A few years later, Lindelof and J. J. Abrams wrote the pilot for Lost. Shortly after it was shot, Abrams left the show to do Mission: Impossible III with Tom Cruise. Lindelof had no experience as a showrunner and called Cuse for showrunning advice on the side. Cuse's interest in the material and a conviction that he could turn Lost into a long-running series led him to opt out of a lucrative studio deal elsewhere to take the job as showrunner. He subsequently trained Lindelof to be his co-showrunner, and together they ran the show for all of its six-year run.'Lost' soul mates By Bill Keveney, USA TODAY April 10, 2006.

In the case of Lost, it worked out great; I could not have had a better partner than Damon.\\" While ostensibly about a group of plane crash survivors trying to return to civilization, Cuse and Lindelof said the show thematically was about people who are metaphorically lost in their lives and seeking to find themselves again.

It is loosely based on the 1987 novel Watchers by Dean R. Koontz. Plot An explosion occurs in a classified research laboratory, causing an intense fire. A mutated monster known as the OXCOM (Outside Experimental Combat Mammal) escapes and chases a golden retriever from the same lab, through the surrounding woods. The dog outruns it and hides in a barn. In the barn, Travis Cornell (Corey Haim) is with his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman). Thinking it is her father, Travis leaves. Tracey discovers the beast and screams, summoning her father who is attacked. Meanwhile, Travis finds the dog in the back of his car and a military/police force is sweeping the area for the escapees. Travis starts to realize the dog is extraordinary and decides to keep it. Meanwhile, an NSO agent named Johnson (Michael Ironside) is dispatched by the corporation to retrieve the animals. The next morning, Travis's mother informs him that there has been an accident and that Tracey is in the hospital. Travis and his mother rush to the hospital, but Agent Johnson and his partner will not allow them to see her. Travis pushes past them into Tracey's room, only to find it completely empty. The men claim that she has been transferred to a better location. Travis is puzzled as to why the men were armed. At home, Travis' mother is displeased about the dog. She allows him to keep it when Travis shows the level of intelligence that the dog possesses. While bathing the dog, Travis sees GH3 tattooed on its ear, and concludes it is a research dog, which would explain its superior intellect. Agent Johnson stops by Travis' house to ask questions and the dog hides. The dog tracks Travis down at school, where he types 'D ANG ER N S O' on a computer. Travis is given detention for bringing a pet to school. Meanwhile, three of Travis's friends are murdered by the OXCOM in the woods. The OXCOM then traces the dog to the school, where two staff members are killed. One is able to call the police. The now-suspicious sheriff and a policewoman arrive, and she is also killed. When the sheriff confronts Agent Johnson, he is forced to tell the sheriff the truth regarding the killer, but asks that they move to a quieter location away from the press. He explains that it was a scientific project gone wrong and that the OXCOM is chasing the dog, which targets and kills anything it comes across or that has been in contact with the dog. He then abruptly murders the sheriff. A family friend who is fixing the washing machine mentions that a man stopped by earlier asking if they owned a dog. Travis, realizing the NSO is after them, sneaks out of the house. His mother stops him before he can drive away, telling him that they are in it together. Back inside, they find their friend dead. They run upstairs with the dog, locking the bedroom door. The beast begins to break it down. The mother climbs onto the adjacent rooftop while Travis grabs a hunting gun. He tells her to start the truck and jumps out the window followed by the dog who is knocked down by the OXCOM. He fires, then picks up the injured dog, and the three drive to a veterinarian. Noticing the code on the dog's ear, the vet calls the authorities. Travis catches on and they leave the vet's office before the NSO agents can arrive. The next morning after the agents track them to the motel they are staying, the mother creates a diversion, allowing Travis and the dog to escape the NSO agents. Travis takes the dog to his father's old cabin in the woods. His mother insists the NSO agents let her visit Tracey. Although Johnson claims the NSO is protecting her while she recovers, Travis's mother realizes that the sedated Tracey is unharmed and her room has no medical equipment, and that the NSO are holding her as a prisoner. The agents take the women to the cabin to use as hostages, but Travis throws a homemade Molotov cocktail at the NSO agents, allowing the two women to run into the cabin. Agent Johnson fires at them, but he is stopped by his partner who balks at murdering a woman and two kids. Johnson then reveals that he is the corporation's third experiment, a genetically engineered assassin with no conscience, and kills his partner. In a tussle with Johnson, Travis is stabbed in the leg with his own knife. The dog jumps through the window and onto Johnson, allowing Travis to stab him through the neck. Johnson, unfazed by the stab wound, claims that they will die anyway before being shot to death by Mrs. Cornell. Armed with homemade weapons, the team readies themselves for the beast. When it arrives, Travis shoots at it and it throws the dog into the truck windshield. Travis follows it into the woods, where he finds it injured and sobbing. At first, he cannot bring himself to kill it. It then attacks him and he is forced to finish it off. Travis, his mother, Tracey and the dog regroup and leave in the beaten truck as the farmhouse burns down. Release The film was given a limited release in the United States by Universal Pictures in December 1988. It grossed $940,173 at the U.S. box office. It was released on VHS and LaserDisc by International Video Entertainment in 1989. Artisan Entertainment released the movie as a double feature with Watchers 2 on DVD in 2003. The DVD was presented in full frame with no bonus features and is now out of print. Reception Critical reception for Watchers has been mostly negative. Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film one and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it \\"awful\\" and criticized the film's monster as being \\"ludicrous\\". Sequels Despite there being no sequel novels by Koontz, producer Roger Corman has released three sequels - Watchers II, Watchers 3 and Watchers Reborn.

He played three seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League following two seasons with the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League. Papale's story was the inspiration behind the 2006 film Invincible.  High school years  Papale was born in Glenolden, Pennsylvania, attended Interboro High School in Prospect Park and lettered in football, basketball, and track and field. In his only year of varsity football, Papale won All-Delaware County Honorable Mention honors. In track, he was a standout pole vaulter, triple jumper, and long jumper. He began competing in track during his senior year at Interboro. He won the District I (Philadelphia suburban area) large-schools championship in pole vault, then finished fourth in the state meet. Papale's best pole vault that year was 12 ft 9 in (3.886 m), which edged him into the top 10 all-time PA high school vaulters.  College  Papale attended Philadelphia's Saint Joseph's University on a track scholarship (the university did not have a football team). As a junior, he won a United States Track & Field Federation (USTFF) college development pole vault at Madison Square Garden (February 10) with a vault of 14 ft 6 in (4.42 m). He never placed at IC4A or Penn Relays. Papale did score in the Middle Atlantic Conference championships (University Division, which included La Salle University, Temple University, Lehigh University, Lafayette College, University of Delaware, Bucknell, Gettysburg College, American University, West Chester University). He graduated in 1968 with an MS degree in Marketing/Management Science. =Track and field personal bests and meet results= ; Sophomore Year (1966): : Second in Pole Vault (winner 14'-3\\" (4.34 m)) : Second in the triple jump (winner 45'-3\\" (13.79 m)) ; Junior Year (1967): ; Senior Year (1968) : Third in the pole vault (winner Peter Chiniese 15'-1¬æ\\" (4.616 m)) : First in the long jump (22'-1¬º\\" (6.737 m)) : First in the triple jump (46'-6\\" (14.17 m))  Professional career = Minor league football = Vince Papale's post-collegiate football career began with the Aston Green Knights of the semi-pro Seaboard Football League. At that time, Papale was a teacher at Interboro High School and was coaching the junior varsity football team when he successfully tried out for the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League as a wide receiver. In an ESPN documentary, Papale claimed he lied about his age to join the team (claiming to be 24 years old, when in fact he was 28 at the time.) In his first season with the Bell, Papale caught nine passes for 121 yards, averaging 13.4 yards per catch including catching the first pass in the history of the new league. In 1975 Papale caught only one pass, but it was for a forty-nine yard touchdown. In both seasons with the team, Papale was a special teams standout. = Philadelphia Eagles = His performance with the Philadelphia Bell earned him a meeting in 1976 with head coach Dick Vermeil of the Philadelphia Eagles after general manager Jim Murray got him an invitation to a private workout held by Coach Vermeil. Papale eventually made the team, thereby becoming, at age 30, the oldest rookie in the history of the NFL to play without the benefit of college football experience (other than kickers). He went on to play wide receiver and special teams for the Eagles from 1976 through 1978. During that time, he played in 41 of 44 regular season games (regular seasons being 14 games in 1976‚Äì1977 and 16 games in 1978) recording two fumble recoveries and one 15-yard reception. He was voted Special Teams Captain by his teammates and \\"Man of the Year\\" by the Eagles in 1978 for his many charitable activities. A shoulder injury ended his career in 1979. After retiring from the NFL, he worked as a TV and radio broadcaster for eight years, then became a commercial mortgage banker. Papale, who earned the nickname \\"Rocky\\" (after the Sylvester Stallone character) while playing with the Eagles, is the subject of the Disney movie Invincible, with Mark Wahlberg portraying him. In addition, Papale's legend was cited as a factor in the Eagles' signing of construction foreman/tight end Jeff Thomason for 2005's Super Bowl XXXIX. Personal life Diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2001, Papale has recovered from the disease, to become a spokesman encouraging people to get regular check-ups. He has appeared in commercials for Thomas Jefferson University Hospital encouraging others to be tested. Papale is a sought after motivational speaker. Previously, Papale was the regional director of marketing and senior account executive for higher-education marketing at Sallie Mae. He resides in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, with his wife Janet and two children, Gabriella and Vinny, and remains a diehard Philadelphia Eagles football fan. He is also currently listed as the Secretary/Treasurer of the Philadelphia Chapter of the NFL Alumni Association. His son Vinny played wide receiver for the University of Delaware Blue Hens, and signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in May 2020.

They administer justice in India at a district level. The Civil Court and District Court is judged by District and Sessions Judge.This is the principal court of original civil jurisdiction besides the High Court of the State and which derives its jurisdiction in civil matters primarily from the code of civil procedure. The district court is also a court of sessions when it exercises its jurisdiction on criminal matters under the Code of Criminal procedure. The district court is presided over by a district judge appointed by the state governor with on the advice of chief justice of that high court. In addition to the district judge there may be a number of additional district judges and assistant district judges depending on the workload. The additional district judge and the court presided have equivalent jurisdiction as the district judge and his district court However, the district judge has supervisory control over additional and assistant district judges, including decisions on the allocation of work among them. The district and sessions judge is often referred to as \\"district judge\\" when presiding over civil matters and \\"sessions judge\\" when presiding over criminal matters. Being the highest judge at district level, the district judge also enjoys the power to manage the state funds allocated for the development of judiciary in the district. The district judge is also called \\"metropolitan session judge\\" when presiding over a district court in a city which is designated \\"metropolitan area\\" by the state. Other courts subordinated to district court in the metropolitan area are also referred to with \\"metropolitan\\" prefixed to the usual designation. An area is designated a metropolitan area by the concerned state government if population of the area exceeds one million or more. Appointment and removal The judges of subordinate courts are appointed by the governor in consultation with the chief justice of the high court of the concerned state. A minimum of seven years of practice as a lawyer at bar is a necessary qualification for direct entry level to become a district judge upon a written examination and oral interview by a committee of high court judges, the appointment of district judges is notified by the state government. This is referred to as direct recruitment. District judges are also appointed by way of elevation of judges from courts subordinate to district courts provided they fulfill the minimum years of service but unfortunately the entry level district judge exams have caused the judges on the lower rungs of the judiciary to become lax as their chances of filling up posts for the work they had done may never fructify to promotions because of posts later being filled up by lawyers directly becoming district judges. The next level of ascendancy for a district judge who served sufficient number of years is the post of high court judge. High court judges are usually appointed from a pool of advocates practicing at the bar of the high court and district judges who served for sufficient number of years. This has also caused district judges to wane in their efficiency as they have come to realize that elevation of lawyers directly to high court judges dampens their process of being awarded with promotions for the work they've put in over many years of service. A district judge or additional judge may be removed from his office by the governor on conformation from the high court collegiate. Jurisdiction The district court or additional district court exercises jurisdiction both on original side and appellate side in civil and criminal matters arising in the district. The territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction in civil matters is usually set in concerned state enactments on the subject of civil courts. On the criminal side, jurisdiction is exclusively derived from the criminal procedure code. As per this code the maximum sentence a sessions judge of district court may award to a convict is capital punishment. The district court has appellate jurisdiction over all subordinate courts situated in the district on both civil and criminal matters. Subordinate courts, on the civil side (in ascending order) are, Junior Civil Judge Court,http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/JCJ-selection-plea- seeking-review-of-HC-order-dismissed/article13974437.ece Principal Junior Civil Judge Court, Senior Civil Judge Court (also called sub-court). Subordinate courts, on the criminal side, in ascending order, are Second Class Judicial Magistrate Court, First Class Judicial Magistrate Court, Chief Judicial Magistrate Court. Certain matters on criminal side or civil side cannot be tried by a lower court than a district court. This gives the district court original jurisdiction in such matters. Appeals from the district courts lie to the High Court of the concerned state and further it goes to Supreme Court if the any of the party is not satisfied with the decision given by the High Court.

He has been described by the club as \\"a true Celtic legend\\". Early life James was born in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire on 11 October 1880 to parents John McMenamin and Hannah Regan; his father adopted the name 'McMenamin' after he moved to Scotland from County Tyrone. John's brother, also called James, settled in Rutherglen during the same period with his wife Ann Smith but maintained the traditional spelling 'McMenemy'. This ‚Äì and also due to the player himself using both styles ‚Äì has led to some mis-attributing of the player's date of birth to that of his cousin (James McMenemy, born at Rutherglen on 23 August 1880). Playing career =Club= McMenemy began his career playing for local Junior teams Cambuslang Hibernian and Rutherglen Glencairn, winning the Scottish Junior Cup and Glasgow Junior League double with the latter in 1902, alongside Alec Bennett.Scottish Junior Cup Finals 1886-1919  1901‚Äì02 Rutherglen Glencairn 1‚Äì0 Maryhill, Scottish Junior Football Association In June 1902, aged 21, he joined Celtic, where he would become a mainstay in the side for the next two decades. Nicknamed \\"Napoleon\\" by manager Willie Maley due to his strategic and leadership qualities and calmness, as well as an apparent resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte, he was also said to be \\"a master of the deceptive movement\\" who \\"seldom troubled himself with the physical side of the game ‚Äì he had no need.\\" He made his debut on 29 September 1902 against Hearts, scoring for the first time in a 3‚Äì0 win over Port Glasgow Athletic two months later. One of his first important actions was away from the pitch when he successfully persuaded Bennett to join him at the club; the pair would form Celtic's first famous forward line, along with Davie Hamilton (another former Cambuslang Hibs player), Jimmy Quinn and Peter Somers. League Championship, Scottish Cup and Glasgow Cup trophies; McMenemy is top row, third left (counting players only) McMenemey was in the team that defeated Rangers 3‚Äì2 in the 1904 Scottish Cup final after being down 2‚Äì0, and also played and opened the scoring in a playoff match against the same opposition to decide the 1904‚Äì05 league title. It would be the first of six league titles in a row between 1905 and season 1909‚Äì10, with Celtic also securing two further Scottish Cups in 1907 and 1908. Rangers built a strong team of their own (including Alec Bennett, who had switched sides in 1908) which took the next three titles, but McMenemy remained with Celtic while others were replaced. 1914 Celtic team photo with the Scottish Cup; McMenemy bottom row, second from right On the eve of World War I in season 1913‚Äì14, the club were again crowned champions and Cup winners. This team, including new stars Patsy Gallacher, Jimmy McColl and Andy McAtee plus survivors from the earlier successful squad such as Alec McNair and 'Sunny Jim' Young would win a further three titles, and set a sequence of 62 league games unbeaten (65 including the minor Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup) which would not be surpassed for a century. McMenemy, now in his mid-30s, was one of the Celtic players who worked in reserved occupations during the conflict ‚Äì in his case manufacturing munitions ‚Äì so was not called to frontline action and able to continue to playing football whenever possible (in summer 1918 he was due to be called up, with one brother having been killed and another wounded on the battlefield, but fell ill with influenza and did not leave Scotland before the armistice in November of that year). A teammate, Peter Johnstone, was one of those did perish on the Western Front. Prior to season 1918‚Äì19, 38-year-old McMenemy retired from playing, only to return to Celtic by the halfway point of the season, where he was restored to the line-up and helped secure another Scottish League title, his eleventh overall. He also won six Scottish Cup medals with the clubPotter, David, (2012) Jimmy McMenemy, Celtic Legend: 1902‚Äì1920, JMD Media. (although the only final in which he scored was 1912 against Clyde), an equally impressive total considering the trophy was withheld in 1909 and five editions were not contested during the war. McMenemy made 515 appearances for Celtic in the League and Scottish Cup, scoring 166 goals. In Celtic's all-time records, he ranks in sixth place for league appearances and seventh for league goals. He is also the club's oldest goalscorer (39 years, 56 days v Motherwell, 6 December 1939) and third-oldest player (39 years, 194 days vs St Mirren, 22 April 1920). In June 1920, McMenemy left Celtic and joined Partick Thistle where, in April 1921, aged, 40, he helped them to their one and only Scottish Cup victory, beating Rangers 1‚Äì0 in the final which was held at Celtic Park. He played on at Firhill for two more years, retiring in 1923. =International= McMenemy played 12 times for the Scotland national team, scoring five goals, and also represented the Scottish League XI 14 times, scoring twice. At the age of 40 he also took part in a 1921 summer tour of North America as a member of 'Third Lanark Scotland XI' (organised by Third Lanark and composed of players from seven different clubs); he was reunited with old teammate and rival Alec Bennett who thereafter became the Thirds manager. Coaching and later life After retiring from playing, McMenemy spent some years away from football and spent time as a publican. He came back to Partick Thistle as a coach, then in 1934 returned to Celtic as trainer assisting Willie Maley (the same manager who had brought him to the club three decades earlier), helping players such as Jimmy Delaney and Willie Buchan to develop and taking charge of the squad which won the Empire Exhibition Trophy in 1938, having already secured that year's League title. Maley retired in 1940, however McMenemy was not chosen to succeed him, the role instead going to Jimmy McStay. By then the world was again at war, and McMenemy and Celtic parted company. He died in Glasgow in 1965. =Legacy= In 2010, a selection of McMenemy's medals, Scotland caps and other memorabilia was sold at auction for ¬£3,500. In 2013, the Evening Times newspaper ranked him in 12th position among Celtic's greatest-ever players. In 2014, the 'Celtic Graves Society' held a commemorative event for McMenemy in Dalbeth St Peters Cemetery to recognise his achievements, attended by family members and former players. Personal life Jimmy McMenemy's five sons were also footballers: John won the Scottish Cup with Celtic in 1927 ‚Äì just six years after his father's last win ‚Äì and the Scottish League Championship with Motherwell in 1932; Harry played for Newcastle UnitedRSSSF Scotland international matches 1930s (see 1933 notes) where he won the FA Cup in 1932; Frank played for Hamilton Academical and Crystal Palace;McMenemy, Frank (1930), Hamilton Academical Memory Bank and both James (Maryhill)Junior International Match. Scotland, 3; Ireland, 3., The Glasgow Herald, 7 March 1927 and Joe (Strathclyde) were prominent junior players but did not play at the professional level.

It is near Chesterfield and Bolsover, and the villages of Heath and Doe Lea. The village population is included in the civil parish of Ault Hucknall. The M1 motorway skirts past the village. The village is near the National Trust property of Hardwick Hall. In the hall's estate is Stainsby Mill, a fully working 19th-century water mill. The village was known as Steinesbei in the Domesday survey where it was listed together with several manors including Beighton and Sutton Scarsdale under the lands of Roger de Poitou.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p.744 It was surrounded to the north by a semi-circular moat with banks and ramparts, approximately eight feet in depth. Some of this still remains visible, although in a much reduced form. This is known as \\"The Earthwork\\". The manor of Stainsby was owned by the Savage family, whose members played prolific roles in the king's armies and in society. John Savage was knighted, probably by Henry V, at Agincourt on 15 October 1415, and became a Knight of the Garter. Sir John commanded the left wing at the Battle of Bosworth. Thomas Savage was consecrated Bishop of Rochester, then London and York. One of the Savages was involved in the Babington Plot to kill Queen Elizabeth I and put Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. Along with the Babington family of Dethick, their deeds resulted in many of them being executed. Around 1580, the manor passed from the hands of the family, eventually being sold on to William Cavendish. Stainsby hosts the Stainsby Festival, a folk festival which takes place in the summer.

The group, like other supporters' trusts, seeks to strengthen the influence of supporters over the destiny of their clubs through democratic supporter ownership. With a membership of over 200,000, it is the largest supporters' trust in the United Kingdom. MUST's members hope to be able to pool their funds to buy a meaningful stake in the club at a future date if the opportunity arises. Origin The ShareholdersUnited Logo The group was founded in 1998 as 'Shareholders United Against Murdoch', to stop a proposed takeover by Australian-American media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. His bid for control of the club was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The group then changed its name simply to Shareholders United and continued its efforts to encourage supporters to own shares in the then publicly traded club. Response to Glazer takeover In 2004, the American businessman Malcolm Glazer made an attempt to buy the club, but was rebuffed by the PLC board because of the large amount of borrowing his bid would rely on. They felt that he would mortgage the club's future to pay for his bid. Shareholders United, together with the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association, organised demonstrations before matches, first before an important league match against Arsenal in an attempt to show the board that supporters were against the takeover, and later before a Champions League match against Milan, when thousands of supporters marched to demonstrate to Glazer that they would not welcome him if he bought the club. They also encouraged members to form flash mobs, where large groups congregated at shops owned by the club's sponsors to temporarily prevent the shops from trading. The purpose of this was an attempt to warn the sponsors that supporters would boycott their products if they continued their links with the club after a takeover. When the United board refused to recommend Glazer's initial bid, it was seen as a victory for Shareholders United, but on 12 May 2005 Glazer was able to purchase the 28% of shares owned by John Magnier and JP McManus, and, by 23 May 2005 held around 76.16% of the club's shares, enough shares to de-list United from the stock exchange, making the club privately owned. Later in 2005, Glazer was able to claim over 98% of the club's shares, enough to implement a mandatory buyout of all remaining shares, according to UK Law. Shareholders United came under a lot of criticism then because many fans felt that by joining they would guarantee the safety of their shareholding as shareholders united had enough shares under its control to allow shareholders to keep their stake, but instead they agreed to sell to the Glazers instead of holding out. Name change Due to the delisting of Manchester United from the London Stock Exchange, and to reflect its essence as a supporters' trust, Shareholders United changed its name to the Manchester United Supporters' Trust. In 2006 the organisation became an industrial and provident society. Though it is recognised by Supporters Direct as the official Supporters Trust for Manchester United, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust is wholly independent from Manchester United, and is in no way directly connected with the club or its owners.

The unit was independent of the Union Army and Navy and reported directly to the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton. The ram fleet operated in coordination with the Mississippi River Squadron during the Union brown-water navy battle against the Confederate River Defense Fleet for control of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The unit was created and led by Colonel Charles Ellet Jr. until his death due to a wound received during the First Battle of Memphis. Command of the unit went to Charles Ellet Jr.'s brother, Alfred W. Ellet. The unit became part of the Mississippi Marine Brigade led by Alfred W. Ellet and command of the Ram Fleet was given to his nephew Charles Rivers Ellet and then to his nephew John A. Ellet. The unit was subsequently transferred to Army command and disbanded in 1864. Formation Charles Ellet Jr. created and led the U.S. Ram Fleet until his death due to a wound received at the First Battle of Memphis Charles Ellet, Jr. was a well- known civil engineer who was known for building the first ever suspension bridge in the United States across the Schuykill River in Philadelphia and the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time, across the Ohio River at Wheeling, West Virginia. When the Civil War broke out, Ellet advocated for the development of steam powered naval rams especially in light of the Confederate build up of ram ships. The Confederate forces captured the USS Merrimack at the Norfolk Navy Yard and converted her to a ram ship. Despite being bulky and slow-moving, the Union forces became convinced of the possibility of ram ships when the CSS Virginia sank the USS Cumberland and USS Congress at Hampton Roads. In March 1862, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton appointed Ellet colonel of engineers and authorized him to form the United States Ram Fleet on the Mississippi River. The Union Navy's Mississippi River Squadron and the Confederate River Defense Fleet were battling for control of the Mississippi and Stanton was convinced by Ellet that the Union Navy efforts would benefit from the addition of ram ships. Ellet and the ram fleet were outside of Union Army or Navy command and reported directly to Stanton. Ellet purchased the nine fastest river steamboats available on the Ohio River and converted them to rams. Their hulls were reinforced, the forward ends filled with hard oak wood, the steam-engines secured and the pilot houses protected by thick wooden planks. Three longitudinal bulkheads were added and supported with iron bars. Central beams were installed from bow to stern and iron peaks were installed on the bows. They were originally not equipped with any guns. Ellet assigned family members as captains of the other rams, including his brother Alfred W. Ellet, his nephew John A. Ellet, and his son Charles Rivers Ellet. On May 25, the Queen of the West and the ram fleet joined the Mississippi River Squadron, led by Charles H. Davis, on the Mississippi River north of Fort Pillow. Davis had little faith in the effectiveness of the rams but allowed the fleet to accompany his gunboats down the river to Memphis. First Battle of Memphis The ram fleet played a critical role in the Union Navy victory at the First Battle of Memphis On June 6, Charles Ellet, Jr. led four ram ships in the Battle of Memphis; the USS Queen of the West, the USS Monarch, the USS Switzerland and the USS Lancaster. Ellet had not coordinated a plan of attack with Davis and when the flotilla approached Confederate forces, the Queen of the West and the Monarch steamed ahead of Davis' gunboats. The Queen of the West rammed and sank the Confederate flagship . After the collision, the Queen of the West came under attack from the CSS Sumter and the CSS Beauregard. The attack sheared off one of the paddle wheels from the Queen of the West and forced her to ground on the riverbank. The Monarch rammed and sank the Beauregard and drove the CSS Little Rebel aground and captured her. The Confederate forces suffered a severe loss at the Battle of Memphis with heavy casualties and the loss of seven of their eight ships. Ellet was wounded in the knee by a Confederate sharpshooter during the battle. His wound was the only serious casualty received on the Union side during the battle. Ellet died 15 days from a blood infection due to the injury. Ellet's brother, Alfred W. Ellet took command of the ram fleet. Actions near Vicksburg Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet took over command of the United States Ram Fleet after the death of his brother, Charles Ellet, Jr. The ram fleet was never incorporated in the Union Navy, however, in the summer of 1862, when David Dixon Porter took over command of the Mississippi River Squadron, he demanded and received full authority over the ram fleet. On June 26, Alfred W. Ellet commanded the Monarch and Charles Rivers Ellet commanded the Lancaster during action on the Yazoo River near Liverpool, Mississippi to capture or destroy three Confederate gunboats. The Confederates burned their ships; the CSS General Van Dorn, CSS General Polk and CSS Livingston, when they saw the Union forces approaching. On July 15, the Queen of the West, , and engaged the Confederate ironclad ram in the Yazoo River. The Arkansas was heavily damaged but escaped into the Mississippi River and took refuge under the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi. On July 22, Queen of the West and attacked Arkansas, despite the batteries at Vicksburg. The Queen of the West rammed the Arkansas but inflicted only minor damage and rejoined the Mississippi River Squadron ships above Vicksburg. The ram fleet ships also conducted activities in the Yazoo River clearing mines and engaging Confederate batteries. Mississippi Marine Brigade In November 1862, the Mississippi Marine Brigade, an amphibious raiding unit, was organized by Alfred W. Ellet and the ram fleet was incorporated as a part of the brigade. On November 5, Charles Rivers Ellet was promoted to the rank of colonel and became the third member of the Ellet family to lead the ram fleet. Ellet was only 19 years old which made him one of the youngest colonels in the Union Army. Under the two Ellet's leadership, the rams figured prominently in actions around and below Vicksburg, Mississippi, into 1863. In January 1863, the ram fleet ships participated in the Battle of Arkansas Post. USS Queen of the West ramming the CSS City of Vicksburg In February 1863, the Queen of the West was run past the batteries of Vicksburg to support Admiral David Farragut south of the city. The Queen of the West severely damaged the CSS Vicksburg and captured four transport ships supplying Confederate forces. The Queen of the West also conducted activities on the Atchafalaya River, destroying Confederate supplies and burning three plantations. She was captured by Confederate forces on the Red River near Fort DeRussy and entered into Confederate service as the CSS Queen of the West. The Mississippi Marine Brigade also saw action at the Battle of Richmond, Louisiana and the Battle of Goodrich's Landing. Due to poor health, Charles Rivers Ellet tendered his resignation on August 14, 1863. and command of the ram fleet went to his cousin John A. Ellet. In August 1863, the Mississippi Marine Brigade was placed under command of General Ulysses Grant. The ram fleet was disestablished in August 1864, and its surviving ships were transferred to other duties. Ships Line engraving published in Harper's Weekly, 1862, illustrating members of the fleet.

The walled garden at Dunmore Park Dunmore Park, the ancestral home of the Earls of Dunmore, includes a large country mansion, Dunmore House,Dunmore House was rebuilt to designs of William Wilkins for the fifth Earl in Tudor Gothic style, in 1820-22; it has been derelict since 1972 (Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. [Yale University Press] 1995, s.v. \\"William Wilkins\\"). and grounds which contain, among other things, two large walled gardens. Walled gardens were a necessity for any great house in a northern climate in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, as a high wall of stone or brick helped to shelter the garden from wind and frost, and could create a microclimate in which the ambient temperature could be raised several degrees above that of the surrounding landscape. This allowed the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, and also of ornamental plants, which could not otherwise survive that far north. The larger of the two gardens covers about six acres, located on a gentle south-facing slope. South-facing slopes are the ideal spot for walled gardens and for the cultivation of frost-sensitive plants. Along the north edge of the garden, the slope had probably originally been more steep. To allow both the upper and lower parts of the garden to be flat and level at different heights, it was necessary to bank up the earth on the higher northern side (away from the main house), behind a retaining wall about high, and thick, which runs the entire length of the north side of the garden.The physical details of the wall are provided in: Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. Vol. II, Stirlingshire: An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments. Edinburgh: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1963, p. 341. Walled gardens sometimes included one hollow, or double, wall which contained furnaces, openings along the side facing the garden to allow heat to escape into the garden, and chimneys or flues to draw the smoke upwards. This particularly benefited fruit trees or grape vines that could, if grown within a few feet of a heated, south-facing wall, be grown even further north than the microclimate created by a walled garden would normally allow. The building A building containing a hothouse was built into this wall in 1761 by John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore. The hothouse, which was located in the ground floor of the building, was used, among other things, for growing pineapples. The south-facing ground floor, which is now covered in stucco and largely overgrown with vines, was originally covered with glass windowpanes.Caroline Holmes, Nic Barlow and Tim Knox, Follies of Europe: Architectural Extravaganzas. London: Garden Art Press, 2008, p. 119. Additional heat was provided by a furnace-driven heating system that circulated hot air through cavities in the wall construction of the adjoining hothouse buildings. The smoke from the furnace was expelled through four chimneys, cleverly disguised as Grecian urns. The upper floor, which is at ground level when approached from the raised northern lawn, contained two small cottage-like apartments, or \\"bothies\\", for the gardeners. North elevation of the cupola. The pavilion, which is well above ground level when approached from the south, may be entered at ground level from the north. Murray left Scotland after the initial structure had been built, and went on to become the last Colonial Governor of Virginia in America. The upper-floor pavilion or summerhouse with its pineapple-shaped cupola and the Palladian lower-floor portico on the south side were added after Murray‚Äôs return from Virginia. The building is a mixture of architectural styles. The south (ground floor) entrance takes the form of a characteristically Palladian Serliana archway, incorporating Tuscan columns. Visitors who step through this archway and into the vestibule below the pineapple face an elaborately framed doorway, flanked, on either side, by pairs of painted wooden Ionic columns, carved with great care, which display perfect fluting and even architecturally correct entasis. The keystone of the Serliana arch is inscribed with the date \\"1761.\\" This has caused some people to speculate that the pineapple was constructed in 1761,For example, see Tim Buxbaum, Scottish Garden Buildings: From Food to Folly. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishers, 1989, p. 50; JB Stevenson, Exploring Scotland's Heritage: The Clyde Estuary and Central Region. Edinburgh: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1985, p. 59. although there is no clear evidence that the archway and the pineapple were built at the same time, or even designed by the same architect. Others suggest that the pineapple was constructed after Murray's return from America in 1776.Fran Beauman, \\"The King of Fruit\\" in Cabinet, Issue 23 (Fall 2006), p. 94. Pineapple viewed from the south Above the Serliana arch is inserted a ‚Äúlater and clumsier,‚ÄùBarbara Jones, Follies & Grottoes London: Constable, 1974, p. 96. panel bearing a relief carving of a heart charged with a cinquefoil and inscribed with the motto Fidelis in Adversis. The design and motto are taken from the Douglas- Hamilton coat of arms, and probably commemorate the marriage, in 1803, of George Murray, the 5th Earl of Dunmore, to Lady Susan Douglas-Hamilton, daughter of Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton. The intricately carved stone pineapple, which is situated between the two bothies, forms an elaborate cupola atop an octagonal pavilion, with sash windows topped with Gothic (or, more accurately, Gothick) ogee arches on seven sides and a door, topped with an ogee transom, on the eighth. The door, on the north side, exits onto the upper level of the garden. Inside the pavilion, the stone walls are gently curved, so that the room is circular rather than octagonal. Even the door and the panes of glass in the seven windows are curved, so as to match the curve of the walls in the room.Bettina Kowalewski, Bed in a Tree. New York: DK Publishing, 2009, p. 100. The pavilion is just large enough to house a round table and some chairs. The pineapple is around high and constitutes a stunning example of the stonemason's craft, being a remarkably accurate depiction of a pineapple. Each of the curving stone leaves is separately drained to prevent frost damage, and the \\"stiff serrated edges of the lowest and topmost leaves and the plum berry-like fruits are all cunningly graded so that water cannot accumulate anywhere, ensuring that frozen trapped water cannot damage the delicate stonework.\\" Despite the unconventional design and the mix of architectural styles, the effect is harmonious because the pineapple and the portico are made of the same stone (ensuring a single colour from top to bottom) and are of a consistent width. Together, they draw the eye upwards in a single smooth motion. The height of the building, from the bottom of the lower floor to the top of the pineapple, is exactly half the width of the structure. Additionally, the width of the portico and pineapple matches the height of the south fa√ßade. Together, these elements, along with the four equally spaced urn-shaped chimneys, add to the sense of Classical order and harmony. The identity of the designer of the folly is uncertain, but it is often attributed to Sir William Chambers who designed similar fanciful structures at Kew Gardens, and who showed a similarly meticulous attention to detail (including curved panes of glass and chimneys disguised as rooftop urns) in his design for the Casino at Marino, just outside Dublin. Pineapples as a decorative motif Cupola detail First brought to Europe by Christopher Columbus from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe in 1493, pineapples became a rare delicacy in Europe, with associations of power, wealth, and hospitality. Architects, artisans and craftsmen adopted the pineapple as a motif, sculpting it into gateposts, railings, weather vanes and door lintels. The motif also featured prominently in interior decoration, fabrics and furniture. Ownership and restoration history After remaining in the family for centuries, the Dunmore Estate was broken up in 1970 and sold in lots. One lot, called the \\"Pineapple Lot\\", included the folly and the large walled garden, along with some woodlands and a small lake. This lot was purchased by the Countess of Perth, and in 1974 was given to the National Trust for Scotland. The \\"Pineapple Lot\\" was then leased to the Landmark Trust, who restored the building and used it to provide holiday accommodation.Sherban Cantacuzino and Susan Brandt, Saving Old Buildings. London: Architectural Press, 1989, p. 184. The of gardens, including woodland, pond and crab-apple orchard, are open to the public year-round. one can rent the gardeners' quarters and the pineapple summerhouse as a holiday home. The bothy on one side of the Pineapple houses two bedrooms and a bathroom, and the bothy on the other side contains a kitchen and a spacious living room.Bettina Kowalewski, Bed in a Tree. New York: DK Publishing, 2009. The rooms have sash windows with a southern exposure overlooking the main (lower) lawn of the estate.

The series was most popular among teenaged girls.Coles, Martin. Hall, Christine. Children's Reading Choices. Routledge, 1998, p 46. History The Point Horror series was launched in 1991 by Scholastic Inc, with the publisher re-releasing several of its previous titles under the Point Horror banner. Authors who published under the label of Point Horror include R.L. Stine, Diane Hoh, Richie Tankersley Cusick, Christopher Pike, and Caroline B. Cooney.Reynolds, Kimberly. Frightening Fiction. Continuum, 2004, pgs 20-44. The series was notable as Blind Date was one of R.L. Stine's first works and helped launch his career.Memory Wipe: Point Horror AV Club After an eight-year absence, Scholastic announced their plan to release three new titles in May 2013, with more to follow later in the year. Literary criticism While the Point Horror series did not attract much serious attention, British children's novelist and literary historian Gillian Avery noted the series was \\"invariably structured around oppositions\\" in that teen horror novels \\"does not 'put an end to the opposition between the real and the imaginary' but, instead, affirms the distinction\\".Avery, Gillian. Representations of Childhood Death. Palgrave Macmillan, 2000, p 193-194 Roy Fisher wrote the series embodied and represented \\"the fears and anxieties of young people about their lives in general and about school in particular\\".Fisher, Roy. Education in popular culture: telling tales on teachers and learners. Routledge, 2008, p 54. Others noted the series' similarity to Stephen King, saying that there \\"was little difference between the approach and design‚Ä¶other than length\\".Cullingford, Cedric. Children's literature and its effects: the formative years. Continuum, 2000, pgs 178-189. Will Davis of The Guardian attributed the decline of the series to higher standards from teen readers and the series' lack of real-life issues.When did Point Horror lose its edge? The Guardian The series has received negative criticism for its portrayal of female characters. British educational historian Mary Hilton wrote in her book Potent Fictions: Children's Literacy and the Challenge of Popular Culture (Routledge, 1996) many young readers viewed the female characters as the ones who get \\"upset, killed, or dumped\\".Hilton, Mary. Potent fictions: children's literacy and the challenge of popular culture. Routledge, 1996, p 136. Offshoots There have been three offshoots of the Point Horror series that, while all showing the \\"Point Horror\\" Logo, are often regarded as separate series in their own rights. They are Point Horror Unleashed, Nightmare Hall and Mutant Point Horror. Nightmare Hall is unique amongst the offshoots as the entire series was written solely by Diane Hoh. Television In November 2019, it was announced that Point Horror would be adapted into an anthology series for HBO Max.https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/point-horror-books-tv-series-hbo- max-1203401142/ Publications =1979= *Avalanche (Arthur Roth) =1986= *Blind Date (R.L.

Professional life The Watney family were the main partners in the Stag Brewery of Pimlico for much of the 19th century.British History on-line In 1837, James Watney became a partner in the brewery with John Lettsom Elliot and Charles Lambert, as later did his sons James and Norman in 1856. The brewery was known as Elliot, Watney & Co from about 1849. John L Elliot withdrew from the business in 1850, and for 8 years remained a partner in name only. He finally retired in 1858 and the firm became known as James Watney & Co. James Watney then kept the management almost entirely to himself until his death, at well over eighty years, in 1884.

Biography Mora was born in Gurb, a village in the comarca of Osona in the Province of Barcelona, Catalonia, on 25 November 1827. Where in Spain he did his seminary studies is not known. He then emigrated to the United States, where he was received and ordained a priest by Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi, C.M., for the Diocese of Monterey, on 19 March 1856. The bishop then assigned him to serve as a missionary priest in several rural parishes until 1863, when he was named Rector of the Church of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles. In 1859 the diocese was changed to the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles. Shortly afterwards, Amat named him Vicar General of the diocese, based in Los Angeles. On 29 May 1873, Pope Pius IX named him coadjutor bishop of the diocese, and titular bishop of Mosynopolis. Amat consecrated him a bishop on August 3, 1873. After the death of Amat on 12 May 1878, Mora took over the diocese. He served it for the next 18 years, during which time he worked to put the Catholic Church on a firm footing in the State of California. In 1895 he established The Catholic Tidings, the first Catholic newspaper for Los Angeles. Mora was given a coadjutor bishop, George Montgomery, the first native-born American named to head the diocese, whom he consecrated in January 1894. He resigned his office on 1 February 1896 at which time the Holy See named him Titular Archbishop of Hierapolis in Syria. He then returned to Spain, where he died on 3 August 1905 in Sarri√†, Barcelona, at the age of 77. Bishop Mora Salesian College Preparatory School in Los Angeles, founded in 1958, was named in his honor. In 1962 his remains were moved from Barcelona to Los Angeles and buried in the Cathedral.

He was an advocate of birth control and eugenics, and founded Pathfinder International. Biography Dr. Clarence J. Gamble was elected president by the board of directors of the newly incorporated Pathfinder Fund on February 27, 1957. But the work of The Pathfinder Fund to make birth control available began some 28 years earlier, in 1929, when Clarence Gamble gave $5,000 to open a maternal health clinic in Cincinnati, Ohio. Along with Margaret Sanger, working in projects since The Negro Project, and Robert Latou Dickinson, he spearheaded the movement to gain acceptance for birth control in the United States. In January 1914, on his twenty-first birthday, Clarence James Gamble received his first million dollars. As the grandson of James Gamble, co-founder of Procter & Gamble, Clarence was an heir to the family money, which came with a stipulation: at least 10 percent was to be devoted to charitable giving. He later increased this 10 percent to 30 and more. He felt an obligation and responsibility. The pursuit of this vision became the driving force in his life. After graduating from Princeton University in 1914 and Harvard Medical School in 1920, Clarence began his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1923 Clarence's interest in medical research led him to secure an apprenticeship with Alfred Newton Richards, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania. However, Clarence's plans to begin working with Richards were interrupted by the death of his father, David Berry Gamble. On June 21, 1924, at the age of 30, Clarence married Sarah Merry Bradley. In Sarah, Clarence found the perfect helpmate and ideal companion. Together they were a team, allowing Clarence to make invaluable contributions to the worldwide birth control movement. In October 1925, three weeks before the birth of the first of their five children, Clarence introduced himself to Dr. Robert Latou Dickinson, who in 1923 had established the National Committee on Maternal Health. Clarence wrote his mother about their first conversation, when Dickinson said that birth control is socially much needed, and that ‚Äúyoung men like you ought to take up the work.‚Äù Dickinson asked Clarence, ‚ÄúDon't you want to help me and keep on with the work when I am through?‚Äù Certainly Dickinson's question smacked of prophecy, for in 1929, a number of events converged to send Clarence decisively on the path to helping Dickinson in service of what Clarence would always call the ‚ÄúGreat Cause.‚Äù In January 1929, Clarence's mother, Mary, died. Clarence wanted to create a memorial for his mother in Cincinnati. In a discussion with her gynecologist, the highly respected Elizabeth Campbell, he learned that his mother had wanted a maternal health clinic in Cincinnati. Dr. Campbell may have related to Clarence the case of a woman who had been pregnant 22 times in 21 years and had 14 surviving children. Clarence became a member of Dickinson's Committee on Maternal Health and through it made his first ‚Äúpathfinder‚Äù grant. With that $5,000, Dr. Campbell opened the Cincinnati Maternal Health Clinic in November 1929 and began dispensing information on birth control to Cincinnati women. At that time, few other birth control clinics existed, other than one in Cleveland, one in Chicago, and Margaret Sanger's Clinical Research Bureau in New York City. At about this same time, Gamble's college friend from Princeton, Stuart Mudd, had become professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. His wife, Emily, would pioneer the field of marriage counseling. Together they had formed the Southeastern Pennsylvania Birth Control League, and opened a birth control clinic in Philadelphia. In the early decades of the twentieth century, the only acceptable contraceptive was the diaphragm. The diaphragm was used with spermicidal jelly, and the League needed to determine which contraceptive jellies, among the many advertised, were effective. Clarence, ready at hand with a lab at the University of Pennsylvania, did some very practical research, and soon he and Sarah were actively supporting the League and the clinic with both his research and funding. By 1930, Clarence was chairman of the board of the Philadelphia Maternal Health Centers. In this new capacity, Clarence learned of the innumerable families in Philadelphia whose children were neither planned nor wanted. He was soon convinced that there must be a simple method of contraception, one that did not require a costly doctor's visit as did fitting of the diaphragm, and that was inexpensive and immediately available. National expansion, state by state He was also convinced that there should be many more birth control clinics. ‚ÄúThe best way to get a birth control program started,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúis to put a field worker on the spot to get things organized and operating while I contribute the needed initial expense.‚Äù He hired Elsie Wulkop, a social worker whom he had known at Massachusetts General Hospital. She began work in Detroit in 1930 and during the next four years helped to open clinics in Michigan, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska. Throughout the late 1930s, always with an eye to strengthening the US birth control movement, Clarence Gamble urged the unification of Margaret Sanger's Clinical Birth Control Research Bureau with the competing American Birth Control League. In 1939, the two organizations became the Birth Control Federation of America. As he worked to expand access to birth control, Clarence followed a pattern of careful spending, making grants just sufficient to allow a clinic to open, and at the same time moving in response to local politics. He did not have a fortune the size of the Rockefellers; he was both unable to and uninterested in permanently subsidizing the impoverished. Working with a public often upset by birth control, he made sure that his fieldworkers educated the community to the point where members understood the importance of contraception, and would thus be willing and able to take over the work and its costs without further outside assistance. Clarence was then able to explore new frontiers and disseminate the workings of birth control more widely. With his carefully calculated cash outlays, Clarence planted seeds that years later flourished. He funded early research for the Southeastern Pennsylvania League's work to identify effective spermicidal jellies. After the American Medical Association (AMA) acknowledged in 1937 that contraception merited a physician's attention, Gamble's research became the basis of the AMA Standards Program for testing contraceptives‚Äîwhich was the measure of the AMA for endorsing contraceptive products, and finally the basis for state and federal legislation. In 1937, he began to fund education and distribution of birth control supplies through the North Carolina State Board of Health, making North Carolina the first state to incorporate birth control in a public health program. This influenced five nearby states‚ÄîSouth Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Virginia‚Äîto incorporate birth control into their public health programs. Throughout the 1930s, Clarence's time was devoted to working with existing birth control organizations, often holding overlapping executive positions. He was president and delegate-at- large of the Pennsylvania Birth Control Federation; state delegate, one of five vice-presidents, and member of the Executive Committee of the Board of the American Birth Control League; medical field director of Margaret Sanger's Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, they both work on special project such as The Negro Project; and treasurer and member of the board of Robert Dickinson's National Committee on Maternal Health. By 1938, Clarence had left Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. He purchased a house outside of Boston, Massachusetts, and funded eight field workers who were nurturing the beginnings of community-supported birth control clinics in Montana, Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, throughout the East Coast, and in the Midwest. During this decade, Clarence and his fieldworkers were responsible for helping to establish birth control clinics in 40 cities in 14 American states. Throughout the many countries where Clarence and his fieldworkers had been working toward the \\"Great Cause,\\" they left not oClarence's sometimes controversial approach was both lauded and criticized throughout his travels. In January 1964, Clarence was diagnosed with leukemia. He told very few about it, but in early 1965, Edna McKinnon visited Charles and Bernadine Zukoski. They told Edna that Clarence was no longer able to take care of administrative matters. The board of directors had to intervene and name a new director. They needed to know if Clarence's family want to continue the work of The Pathfinder Fund. Edna and the Zukoskis put together a plan for transition and sent it to Clarence's children. The Gamble children were committed to continuing the work. Edna McKinnon came to Massachusetts. From July through November 1965, she worked with Clarence and the family to organize the transition. It was not an easy job for Clarence, who was growing weaker each day and whose habits of secrecy and total control were deeply ingrained or for Edna, who had to confront, cajole, and argue as necessary to ensure the solid future of Pathfinder. On November 4, 1965, the first meeting of the newly formed Pathfinder Fund Advisory Council was held in Milton, Massachusetts. All of the Gamble family was there, as were John Gordon and long-term fieldworkers Edith Gates, Margaret Roots, Edna McKinnon, and Charles and Bernadine Zukoski, along with old friends Stuart and Emily Mudd. Ellen Watumull of the Watumull Foundation, which had supported both Margaret Sanger and Clarence Gamble for years, had been invited, and Alan Guttmacher, president of Planned Parenthood- World Population, was there to speak. An unidentified public health physician said, \\"The only reason that our government was now able to officially help these countries [by instituting birth control] was that private foundations such as Pathfinder paved the way by starting things. [Pathfinder] carried on such successful programs with the people and did such a fine job of education that the government was now able to operate in these areas.\\" This essay drawn from the Clarence James Gamble Papers, Countway Library of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and the Sarah Merry Bradley Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe College Dr. Gamble and his workers explained and promoted simple methods‚Äînot the expensive and often impractical diaphragm, but spermicidal jellies, foam powders, sponges to be dipped in salt or other inexpensive solutions‚Äîto women who otherwise would never have known of nor been able to afford contraceptives. At the same time, he recognized the need for scientific data to back his promotion of the simple methods, and he set up extensive clinical trials, with his visiting nurses collecting data that measured the effectiveness of the simple methods. Again and again, it was shown that birth rates were reduced by as much as two-thirds or more using these simple methods. In Logan County, West Virginia, Clarence conducted the most thorough field trial of a chemical contraceptive that had ever been undertaken in the United States. The trial involved 1,345 women who used contraceptive jelly over a three-year period, from June 1936 to August 1939, and decreased their birth rate by 41 percent. Global contacts, global contexts In 1949, Clarence was talking with Frank W. Notestein, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton and future president of the Population Council. Notestein mentioned that Japan was ‚Äúripe for birth control.‚Äù Gamble, in his typical fashion, offered to put up a small sum to translate birth control pamphlets into Japanese. This eventually led to correspondence with Dr. Yoshio Koya, director of Japan's National Institute of Public Health. At that time, much to the distress of their government, Japanese women were terminating half of their pregnancies by abortion. Koya needed support for a field study to determine whether the Japanese would use contraception, were it available. Somewhat tentatively, Clarence, who knew Koya only through correspondence, advanced $700. It was a small investment, which in the Gamble way was to yield big results in a very short time. Koya's Three Village study began fieldwork in November 1950. By May 1951, the study showed that 92 percent of the Japanese population wanted contraception. Koya took this ‚Äúrather amazing data‚Äù to the minister of welfare, and in 1952, the Japanese government allotted funds to put free birth control clinics into all Japanese health centers. Thus began a long-term professional relationship between Clarence and Dr. Koya. For the next 15 years, Gamble supported Koya generously and came to regard him as the one who did more for Japan's birth control program than any other single individual. This Japan venture also marked the entry of Clarence into widespread international activity and the buildup of the Pathfinder team of dedicated colleagues and fieldworkers. Among the dedicated was John E. Gordon, a retiring professor of epidemiology at Harvard's School of Public Health. In 1949, Gordon had turned his academic inquiries to population growth and was convinced that the same methodology applied to epidemiology studies could be used to examine population problems. In 1951, Clarence funded an exploratory visit by Gordon to the Punjab state of India. The resulting India-Harvard-Ludhiana or Khanna study examined the use of contraceptives by Indians in that region and continued for 17 years, generating some three dozen articles, a book, and a monograph. In October 1952, Clarence and Sarah left Massachusetts to meet Dr. Koya in person and attend the November conference in Bombay (now known as Mumbai), India, of the newly organized International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). Clarence would be gone for five months, until March 1953. This was the first of his many long trips during the 1950s, in which he did his own fieldwork, going from city to town to village to city, introducing himself and the ‚ÄúGreat Cause.‚Äù At the IPPF Bombay conference, Clarence was busily finding foreign doctors interested in testing and collecting data on the effectiveness of simple methods of contraception. In the 1930s he had attempted to do this, working with a list of missionary doctors supplied by his brother Sidney, who was a member of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. Little had come of that attempt: foreign customs levied large duties, the climate quickly reduced powder and sponge to paste and gum, and overworked missionary physicians had no time to keep the careful records Clarence needed for substantive clinical studies. The Bombay conference offered new contacts and new opportunities. Tension and disagreement in the field As the field expanded, tensions arose among PPFA, IPPF, the Population Council, and Clarence Gamble. Many in these organizations regarded Dr. Gamble's simple methods and straightforward approach with disdain; his appointment of nonmedical personnel (and women over 50) as fieldworkers, unprofessional; his travels through Asian countries, patronizing; his intrusion into areas staked out by IPPF as their own, intolerable. This was the attitude of Lady Bengal Rama Rau, charismatic chair of IPPF and leader of its India Ocean region, and of Helena Wright, powerful medical director of IPPF. Declaring themselves highly sensitive to the years of oppression waged by white colonists, Rama Rau, Wright, and IPPF maintained that women of whatever color deserved the best that Western medicine could offer‚Äîin this case birth control provided by a fitted diaphragm after a preliminary exam by a professional gynecologist. From Clarence's perspective, IPPF ignored the reality faced by women wanting to be fitted for a diaphragm. He advocated that health workers could be trained to fit diaphragms. His idea sparked controversy because of the implications that it was appropriate to use different standards of care for women in the developing world than for women in the developed world. While provoking disagreement, Clarence's pragmatic approach reflected the reality of patient-to-physician ratios, which in 1947 was estimated to be 6,000:1 in India, making it impossible for physicians to meet patient demand for diaphragms. IPPF maintained that white Europeans should not go uninvited into foreign countries to offer birth control information, but as Clarence knew well, many undeveloped countries did not know what birth control was. Unless education and exposure created the demand for birth control, neither the government nor community groups would ever provide it. And so for his efforts, his dedication, his time, and his money, Clarence originally received little thanks from many in the professional birth control community. At the 1955 Tokyo IPPF conference, which he had helped to organize in committee beginning in 1953, and to which he contributed $3,000, he was refused admittance to most of the conference sessions. The reports of his fieldworkers were dismissed as mere ‚Äútravelogues.‚Äù ‚ÄúHere at the conference,‚Äù wrote Clarence, ‚Äúthe isolation of our team seems complete.‚Äù The Japanese, on the other hand, expressed great gratitude. Dr. Kageyasu Amano acknowledged that it was Clarence who had brought together the roughly 30 Japanese birth control groups into a cohesive organization. At the celebratory dinner for Margaret Sanger on the last night of the Tokyo conference, the Japanese awarded Clarence the Margaret Sanger Trophy, a silver loving cup 18 inches tall, inscribed, ‚ÄúClarence J. Gamble, the Benefactor of the Family Planning Movement in Japan.‚Äù The Margaret Sanger Trophy was an especially appropriate award for Clarence. Over the years, his relationships with Robert Latou Dickinson and Margaret Sanger were warm and professional. Clarence worked closely with and financially supported Dickinson's National Committee on Maternal Health until Dickinson's death in 1950. Clarence gave both financial support and time to Margaret Sanger's Clinical Birth Control Research Bureau. After the IPPF Japan conference, Clarence, accompanied by his oldest son, Richard, visited the doctors who had agreed to test the simple methods. Their results were encouraging: typically a reduction from 70 to 20 pregnancies per 100 couples per year. On that first Asia trip, Clarence and Richard promoted birth control in 13 countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, and Burma, and assisted local leaders in forming family planning associations in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Japan. From 1954 through 1956, Clarence was traveling constantly, visiting and revisiting over a dozen countries on each four- or five-month trip, laying the groundwork for the availability of birth control throughout Asia. Whether traveling or remaining in the States, ‚ÄúClarence Gamble,‚Äù as one distressed IPPF worker wrote, ‚Äúwas everywhere and into everything.‚Äù But the task needed more workers. Eugenics and forced sterilization Clarence Gamble and James Hanes were founding members of the Human Betterment League of North Carolina in 1947.Against Their Will: North Carolina's Sterilization Program, retrieved December 10, 2011 The League was tied to forced sterilization programs that saw both men and women, mostly poor, of low IQ, and predominantly black extraction, undergo surgical sterilization without consent, with the goal being to reduce the state's welfare burden and improve the gene pool. The program ended in 1977; the state government apologized publicly in 2002. Governor Bev Perdue is advocating for financial restitution to be made to 7,600 victims.Thousands Sterilized, A State Weighs Restitution, New York Times on-line, December 9, 2011 Pathfinder Fund Clarence would do whatever was most effective at the time with relatively small investments. In addition to paying the salaries of visiting nurses and health workers to staff the clinics and office workers to manage offices, he paid for and distributed print materials: posters in native languages, comic-book-style pamphlets, flyers, reprints of scientific articles, booklets and books, and contraception manuals. He provided anatomical models of the human pelvis, purchased film strips and movies, and supported their production. Clarence defied the conventionally held views of the role of women at that time and decided to take advantage of the adroit management and diplomatic social skills that he had observed older women often possessed, exactly the skills that were needed to introduce such a potentially controversial topic as birth control into a community. As he had in the 1930s, when he was engaging field workers to open clinics in the United States, Clarence chose women in their fifties to be his envoys. Margaret Roots was a widow with three grown children, touring the world with friends, when Clarence met her in India in 1953. She worked first in Sri Lanka, then in Indonesia, India, Thailand, and Korea. Edith Gates had been working for the YWCA and similar organizations internationally for 30 years when Clarence met her in Hawaii in 1954 and asked her to go to Africa and South America. Clarence and his fieldworkers adapted written materials and tailored their social interactions to local culture. In Puerto Rico, mothers were happy to have a visiting nurse come into their homes. In Hong Kong, this was not acceptable. In Sri Lanka, in 1954, a woman did not walk the streets alone; Margaret Roots made sure that another woman accompanied her when she went out or when she visited a male authority. Always, Clarence advocated simple methods, insisting that the people should decide for themselves the number of children they wanted and offering family planning methods that could be used without intensive medical supervision. However, he also provided the diaphragm and jelly when it was appropriate or requested. He understood that \\"favorable public opinion regarding family planning takes years to develop\\" and so he worked for the long term; if his fieldworkers could not open a birth control clinic within a year or two, they could leave behind a committee that might do so in the future. In 1957, at the suggestion of his attorney son-in- law, Lionel Epstein, husband of his oldest child, Sally, the ongoing philanthropic activity of Clarence Gamble was incorporated into The Pathfinder Fund. In 1991, The Pathfinder Fund was renamed Pathfinder International. In a typical report from 1959, The Pathfinder Fund listed its activities and expenditures: the fund was paying the salary of a nurse in Mombasa; a nurse in Burma; a nurse in Maadi, Egypt; supplemental salaries for nurses in Taiwan; part-time salary for secretary of the Associazione Italiana Per L'Educazione Demografica; salaries for three workers in Colombo, Sri Lanka; salaries for persons working for the family planning associations of Thailand and Bangladesh, both under supervision of Mrs. Roots; consultation fee for Dr. Luigi DeMarchi, (who, with his wife Maria Luisa DeMarchi, were crusaders for the legalization of birth control in Roman Catholic Italy); salary for a nurse in Hong Kong, who worked in an area of \\"hillside shacks beyond the ends of roads,\\" occupied by refugees; and in August, supplementary payments of approximately $5 per month were allowed for nurses in Taiwan because the nurses must live in the village \\"where they were exposed to snakes, barking dogs, and sleeping behind doors with no locks.\\" The Margaret Sanger Research Bureau was funded for a study of foam tablets, the salary of an intern, half the salary of the head of their research program, and general expenses. Miscellaneous grants were made to Princeton, PPFA, and local community groups. In 1960, Edna McKinnon, an attorney, a widow, and an \\"older woman\\" joined Pathfinder. In the 1930s, Edna had been opening clinics throughout the South as field representative for Margaret Sanger's Research Bureau and had worked for Clarence when he was field director of that organization. Edna became a Gamble fieldworker in Malaya, Indonesia, and, briefly, with great difficulty, in Saudi Arabia. Margaret Roots, Edith Gates, and Edna McKinnon were long-term fieldworkers for Pathfinder. They loved their work and were deeply loyal to Clarence. As Edna McKinnon later explained, :\\"Clarence always worked on the basis that he was no more important than anyone else.... You could always be sure that if we were really in a bind, he'd come down and help you get out. It didn't mean that he was there all the time, but I can't emphasize enough how much the correspondence made me feel that we were having careful direction. But I will say this, that sometimes I'd have anywhere from six letters a day... When I later worked with PPFA, when Clarence wasn't as closely connected, I didn't feel that security. I don't know what it is. It's a psychological something that he gave to each of his workers that was priceless.... He was interested in every detail. There wasn't anything that was too much or too detailed for him to be interested in.\\" At the time, The Pathfinder Fund was also covering the salaries of staff in the home offices in Boston, salaries and expenses of John Gordon and Yoshio Koya, of fieldworkers Margaret Roots, Edith Gates, and after 1960, Edna McKinnon. Beginning in 1962, expenses were covered for volunteer fieldworkers Charles and Bernadine Zukoski. Upon retirement from a successful banking career, Charles Zukoski and his wife, Bernadine, devoted themselves to The Pathfinder Fund, working in the States and overseas, accomplishing much in Turkey, Iran. and Ethiopia. Others, including fieldworkers Ruth Martin and Sarah Lewis, who worked for shorter periods, were supported, as were individuals on scholarship to Harvard School of Public Health. After incorporation of The Pathfinder Fund in 1957, Clarence took fewer and shorter world trips. With his own organization and a team of fieldworkers in place, administrative duties increased, but he was still able to explore his many innovative ideas related to increasing access to contraception. For example, he considered hiring writers to place stories that mentioned birth control in pulp magazines. With his Public Progress Program, which encouraged personal letters to the media, he managed to get the taboo subject of birth control into such popular magazines as Colliers and Reader's Digest. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Clarence and his fieldworkers visited 60 countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. From these visits, family planning associations and clinics emerged in at least 30 countries, while groundwork was laid in others. And just as The Pathfinder Fund was being incorporated, Gregory Pincus set up his first clinical trial of the first contraceptive pill in Puerto Rico. Clarence drew on his contacts from the 1930s in Puerto Rico, when he had rescued Puerto Rico's birth control program. At that time, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration had eliminated federal support for a thriving chain of clinics due to pressure from Catholic bishops, and Clarence had provided the support to keep them going. Two decades later, Clarence organized additional trials of the Pill with Dr. Adaline Satterthwaite at the Ryder Memorial Hospital in Humacao, and in 1961, Dr. Satterthwaite began testing the intrauterine device (IUD) as well. Though Clarence supported trials of the pill, he regarded it as impractical because of its daily dose requirement and relatively high cost. The IUD was both practical and low cost, requiring one-time insertion of an inexpensive piece of plastic. Dr. Satterthwaite quickly demonstrated its safety, and Clarence began mailing out the plastic loops. The office space that he rented above Sparrs Drug Store, adjacent to Harvard Medical School, became a distribution center for IUDs. In Korea, where as many as 2,000 babies were abandoned yearly in the Seoul streets, the government welcomed this new method of practical birth control. By October 1962, Clarence had sent almost 3,000 loops to Korea. Predictably, he ran up against the Population Council, who wanted complete control of IUD trials and distribution. Clarence countered by opening his own manufacturing plant in Hong Kong. By 1964, David Burleson had been brought in to supervise Pathfinder's worldwide IUD project, and Clarence was receiving reports on the IUD from 72 doctors in 32 countries. At the time of his death in 1966, The Pathfinder Fund was delivering IUDs to 504 doctors in 74 countries. Despite sharp disagreements, Clarence continued to attempt to work with the Population Council, PPFA, and IPPF. The clinics and family planning associations that Clarence funded and his fieldworkers opened were all encouraged to become members of PPFA or IPPF, and, indeed, most did. When Dr. Koya wanted to include Clarence as co-author of the Three Village Study, acknowledging the many design suggestions he had contributed, Clarence told him not to. The modesty was characteristic of him. He held true to the words of his mother, Mary: \\"Results are what count, not position. Why care who's given the credit?\\" Legacy Throughout the many countries where Clarence and his fieldworkers had been working toward the \\"Great Cause,\\" they left not only clinics and family planning associations but also dedicated individuals, who, in their native countries, were actively carrying on the work. Clarence's sometimes controversial approach was both lauded and criticized throughout his travels. In January 1964, Clarence was diagnosed with leukemia. He told very few about it, but in early 1965, Edna McKinnon visited Charles and Bernadine Zukoski. They told Edna that Clarence was no longer able to take care of administrative matters. The board of directors had to intervene and name a new director. They needed to know if Clarence's family want to continue the work of The Pathfinder Fund. Edna and the Zukoskis put together a plan for transition and sent it to Clarence's children. The Gamble children were committed to continuing the work. Edna McKinnon came to Massachusetts. From July through November 1965, she worked with Clarence and the family to organize the transition. It was not an easy job for Clarence, who was growing weaker each day and whose habits of secrecy and total control were deeply ingrained or for Edna, who had to confront, cajole, and argue as necessary to ensure the solid future of Pathfinder. On November 4, 1965, the first meeting of the newly formed Pathfinder Fund Advisory Council was held in Milton, Massachusetts. All of the Gamble family was there, as were John Gordon and long-term fieldworkers Edith Gates, Margaret Roots, Edna McKinnon, and Charles and Bernadine Zukoski, along with old friends Stuart and Emily Mudd. Ellen Watumull of the Watumull Foundation, which had supported both Margaret Sanger and Clarence Gamble for years, had been invited, and Alan Guttmacher, president of Planned Parenthood-World Population, was there to speak. An unidentified public health physician said, \\"The only reason that our government was now able to officially help these countries [by instituting birth control] was that private foundations such as Pathfinder paved the way by starting things. [Pathfinder] carried on such successful programs with the people and did such a fine job of education that the government was now able to operate in these areas.\\" This essay drawn from the Clarence James Gamble Papers, Countway Library of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and the Sarah Merry Bradley Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe College.

The United States Sanitary Commission (USSC) was a private relief agency created by federal legislation on June 18, 1861, to support sick and wounded soldiers of the United States Army (Federal / Northern / Union Army) during the American Civil War. It operated across the North, raised an estimated $25 million in Civil War era revenue (assuming 1865 dollars, $ million in ) and in-kind contributions to support the cause, and enlisted thousands of volunteers. The president was Henry Whitney Bellows, and Frederick Law Olmsted acted as executive secretary. It was modeled on the British Sanitary Commission, set up during the Crimean War (1853-1856), and from the British parliamentary report published after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (\\"Sepoy Rebellion\\").The New York Times. \\"Necessity of Sanitary Organization\\" (Vol. X, No. 3031: Sunday, June 9, 1861). p. 5, column 1. Retrieved: August 4, 2015. History Picture from the Brady-Handy Collection misidentified in one source as the \\"New York Police\\" Commissioners. In fact it is of the United States Sanitary Commission. From left to right: Dr. William Van Buren, George T. Strong, Commission President Henry Whitney Bellows, Dr. Cornelius R. Agnew, and Dr. Oliver Wolcott Gibbs.The Diary of George Templeton Strong, The Civil War 1860-1865, Edited by Allan Nevis, The MacMillan Co., NY 1962 Henry Whitney Bellows, (1814-1882), a Massachusetts clergyman, planned the USSC and served as its only president.Sanitary Commission, p. 10. According to The Wall Street Journal, \\"its first executive secretary was Frederick Law Olmsted, (1822-1903), the famed landscape architect who designed New York's Central Park\\". George Templeton Strong, (1820-1875), New York lawyer and diarist, helped found the commission and served as treasurer and member of the executive committee. In June 1861, the Sanitary Commission set up its central office inside the United States Treasury Building, just east of the Executive Mansion (now the White House), on Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street in central Washington, D.C. By late October 1861, the USSC Central Office and the U.S. War Department had received detailed studies and reports from the Sanitary Inspectors of more than four hundred regimental camp inspections. The rapidly crowded events of those first six months of the war displayed the sheer gravity of the situation in which the adjustment to the means and agencies were desperately needed to ensure a high health-rate in all those untrained Union Army regiments.Sanitary Commission. pp. 16‚Äì22. Immediately following the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, the first orders and receipts submitted to the Central Office began to arrive from the military Union Army hospitals at Alexandria, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., requesting water-beds, small tables for writing in bed, iron wire cradles for protecting wounded limbs, dominoes, checkerboards, Delphinium and hospital gowns for the wounded.Sanitary Commission. pp. 14‚Äì15. The demands of the war soon required more frequent decision-making. This led to the creation of the Standing Committee, which met on a nearly daily basis in New York City where most of its members resided. The Standing Committee initially consisted of five commissioners who retained their position for the entire war: Henry W. Bellows, George Templeton Strong, William H. Van Buren, M.D., Cornelius R. Agnew, M.D., and Wolcott Gibbs, M.D. In addition to setting up and staffing hospitals, the USSC operated 30 soldiers' homes, lodges, or rest houses for traveling or disabled Union soldiers. Most of these closed shortly after the war.\\"Soldiers' Homes and Lodges\\" in The Sanitary Commission Bulletin 3:1279. Available at Google Books. Also active in the association was Colonel Leavitt Hunt, (1831-1907), a New York lawyer and pioneering photographer. In January 1864, he wrote to 16th President Abraham Lincoln's secretary John George Nicolay asking that Nicolay forward him any documents he might have available with the President's signature. Hunt's mother, the widow of Vermont congressman Jonathan Hunt, planned to attach Lincoln's signature to copies of several casts of the President's hand, to be sold to raise funds for the war effort.Letter from Col. Leavitt Hunt to John George Nicolay, January 1864, General Correspondence of Abraham Lincoln, American Memory. Library of Congress. Accessed September 23, 2013 Other fund raising events included the famous 50 pound sack of flour that was auctioned off by Reuel Colt Gridley. By auctioning off the same sack of flour, which was then re-donated to be sold again, Gridley eventually raised more than $250,000.00 for the Sanitary Commission. States could use their own tax money to supplement the Commission's work, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor David Tod, a War Democrat who won office on a coalition \\"Union Party\\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, it sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals with doctors, nurses and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to eleven hospital ships. The state also set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.Eugene E. Roseboom, The Civil War Era, 1850-1873 (1944) p 396 The government constructed the Pension Building in Washington, DC to handle all the staff to process the pension requests and administer them. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After the war, the USSC volunteers continued to work with Union Army veterans to secure their bounties, back pay, and apply for pensions. It supported the \\"health and hygiene\\" of the veterans. They had a Department of General Relief which accepted donations for veterans, too. The USSC organization was finally disbanded in May 1866. =Women in the USSC= Organizational chart of the U.S. Sanitary Commission by John Y. Culyer, 1864 Arising from a meeting in New York City of the Women's Central Relief Association of New York, the organization was also inspired by the British Sanitary Commission of the Crimean War. The American volunteers raised money (estimated at $25 million), collected donations, made uniforms, worked as nurses, ran kitchens in army camps, and administered hospital ships, soldiers' homes, lodges, and rests for traveling or disabled soldiers. They organized Sanitary Fairs in numerous cities to support the Federal army with funds and supplies, and to raise funds for the work of the USSC. Women who were prominent in the organization, often traveling great distances, and working in harsh conditions, included Louisa May Alcott, Almira Fales, Eliza Emily Chappell Porter, Katherine Prescott Wormeley, and many others. Dorothea Dix, serving as the commission's superintendent, convinced the medical corps of the value of women working in their hospitals.Thomas J. Brown, Dorothea Dix: New England Reformer (Harvard U.P. 1998) Over 15,000 women volunteered to work in hospitals, usually in nursing care.Jane E. Schultz, \\"The Inhospitable Hospital: Gender and Professionalism in Civil War Medicine\\", Signs (1992) 17#2 pp. 363‚Äì392 in JSTOR They assisted surgeons during procedures, gave medicines, supervised the feedings and cleaned the bedding and clothes. They gave good cheer, wrote letters the men dictated, and comforted the dying.Ann Douglas Wood, \\"The War within a War: Women Nurses in the Union Army\\", Civil War History (1972) 18#3 A representative nurse was Helen L. Gilson (1835‚Äì68) of Chelsea, Massachusetts, who served in Sanitary Commission. She supervised supplies, dressed wounds, and cooked special foods for patients on a limited diet. She worked in hospitals after the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg. She was a successful administrator, especially at the hospital for black soldiers at City Point, Virginia.Edward A. Miller, \\"Angel of light: Helen L. Gilson, army nurse\\", Civil War History (1997) 43#1 pp 17‚Äì37 The middle-class women who volunteered provided vitally needed nursing services and were rewarded with a sense of patriotism and civic duty in addition to the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and gain new ones, while receiving wages and sharing the hardships of the men.Elizabeth D.

Bridget Diver also worked for the Commission. Sanitary Fairs Stereoscopic image of the picture gallery at the Metropolitan Fair of 1864 held in New York State From the outset, many local groups sponsored fund- raising events to benefit the Commission. As the war progressed these became larger and more elaborate. In February of 1863, the women of Lowell, Massachusetts, organized a two-day \\"Mammoth Fair\\" occupying two exhibition halls and netting over four thousand dollars for the cause.Lowell Daily Citizen and News, 14 February 1863, p. 2. Groups in other cities soon adopted this plan.Manchester (NH) Daily Mirror, 9 May 1863, p. 4; Salem (MA) Register, 11 June 1863, p. 2. Organizing these Sanitary Fairs offered ways for local communities to be directly part of supporting the war effort of the nation. The largest Sanitary Fair during the war was held in Chicago from October 27 to November 7, 1863. Called the Northwestern Soldiers' Fair, it raised almost $100,000 for the war effort. It included a six-mile-long parade of militiamen, bands, political leaders, delegations from various local organizations, and a contingent of farmers, who presented carts full of their crops. Chicago's Northwestern Soldiers' Fair included a \\"Curiosity Shop\\" of war souvenirs and Americana. Its organizers intended its displays of weapons, slavery artifacts and other items to illustrate for Union visitors the contrast between the \\"barbaric\\" Southern enemy and the \\"civilized\\" North. The fairs generally involved large-scale exhibitions, including displays of art, mechanical technology, and period rooms. These sorts of displays called upon ideas of the American past, a history that local communities held in common. Often, different communities competed with each other over their donations to the national cause. People in various cities and towns across the North contributed to the same war effort because they identified as having shared fortunes in their common nation.Lawson, Melinda. Patriot Fires: Forging a New American Nationalism in the Civil War North, Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2002. The USSC leadership sometimes did not approve of the excitement and lavishness of the fairs. They wanted to encourage sacrifice as a component of membership in a nation. Although the fairs were one way to create a national identity which might motivate citizens to perform their duties, the commission leadership did not want the fairs to become the focus of USSC work. Chicago held a second sanitary fair from April 27, 1865 to June 21, 1865 and the women organizers published a newspaper entitled Voice of the Fair that was distributed at the event.

But in late 1980, the riverboat was accidentally dropped from a crane, attempting to lift it into the dry dock area for a routine overhaul, and its hull was completely destroyed beyond repair. The damaged riverboat was taken to a boneyard for awhile before being broken up for scrap, after determining that the Magic Kingdom no longer needed two riverboats on the Rivers of America, and the Admiral Joe Fowler suffered some mechanical problems. The riverboat's steam engine machinery was being shipped to Tokyo Disneyland as part of the Mark Twain riverboat's.

Bliss Copy Cintas also collected manuscripts and his acquisitions included the only first edition of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, and the fifth and final manuscript of Abraham Lincoln's \\"Gettysburg Address\\", once owned by the family of Col. Alexander Bliss, and known as the \\"Bliss copy\\". Cintas‚Äô purchase of the manuscript, for $54,000, in 1949, set a record at the time for the sale of a document at a public auction. Cintas' properties were claimed by the Castro government after the Cuban Revolution in 1959, but Cintas, who died in 1957, willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, provided it was kept at the White House, to where it was transferred in 1959. The manuscript, the only one to which Lincoln added his signature, is exhibited in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House. =Death and estate= Before his death, Cintas entrusted the administration of his estate, including his art collection, to The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., with Ethan Alyea serving as legal counsel. With the help and encouragement of David Rockefeller, Alyea named a blue ribbon board of trustees to carry out Cintas‚Äô wishes for a foundation. Early members of the board included Theodore Rousseau (curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art), Porter A. McCray (director of the International Program at New York's Museum of Modern Art) and A. Hyatt Mayor (curator of prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art). CINTAS Foundation The foundation's original name, the Cuban Art Foundation, was changed in 1962 to honor its founder. The Cintas' legacy has fostered the development of Cuban artists, promoting the professional development of these artists and the continuity of Cuban traditions in art. Cintas' foresight has resulted in more than 300 fellowships and grants to creative writers, architects, composers, visual artists and filmmakers, many of whom have later achieved national and international renown. The roster of Cintas fellows is a testament to the talent and creativity of the Cubans and their direct descendants who have live throughout the world. The Cintas Foundation is the oldest entity in the United States dedicated to the support of Cuban artists. In addition to the fellowships, the CINTAS Foundation oversees two major art collections in the United States and sponsors exhibitions curated from these collections. The CINTAS Fellows collection is composed of works donated by the fellows in appreciation of the CINTAS fellowship. It has grown to be the largest body of Cuban art outside Cuba and continues to grow regularly. The CINTAS Foundation awards fellowships annually to creative artists of Cuban lineage. The CINTAS Foundation was established with funds from the estate of Cintas. CINTAS Fellowships acknowledge demonstrated creative accomplishments and encourage the development of creative artists in architecture, literature, music composition and the visual arts. Past recipients include the Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning novelist Oscar Hijuelos, the playwright Maria Irene Fornes, painters Carlos Alfonzo and Emilio Falero, the photographer Andres Serrano, the architect Andr√©s Duany, the poet Silvia Curbelo, sculptors Mar√≠a Elena Gonz√°lez and Rafael Consuegra, as well as the composer Orlando Garcia.

Originally launched as a Chardonnay, the brand has been expanded to include additional varietals including Merlot, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is sold primarily in the United States, and has been discontinued on the U.K. market. The price point for the brand is at the modest \\"entry level\\", at about $8 per bottle (as of 2006), and about 420,000 cases (5 million 750 ml bottles) per year for the brand are exported to the U.S. market (as of 2016). The brand's Chardonnay is (or has been at one time) the largest-selling brand of French Chardonnay in the United States. The label features a cartoon hippopotamus. History The brand began as a collaboration between French winemaker Thierry Boudinaud and British wine importer Guy Anderson that was launched as a company in 1995. The original intention of the partnership was to sell wines produced in the Luangedoc- Rousillion region of southern France to foreign markets. Many American consumers, especially younger ones, have come to dislike traditional European wine labels that typically feature a picture of a classic chateau and are difficult to distinguish, understand, and remember. \\"Even if people love a French wine, they can't remember its name\\", Anderson said. The creators of the Fat Bastard brand attempted to solve these marketing problems by employing a label name that is overtly rude. The brand is an example of a world-wide trend of various brands that have embraced a similar strategy, trying to stand out from the crowd as the number of brands available on the market has continued to increase. Another French wine brand of the Luangedoc-Rousillion region that is also marketed with similarly distinctive informal name, a fanciful cartoon drawing on the label (featuring a Frenchman riding a red bike), and modest pricing (less than $10) is Red Bicyclette, introduced by Gallo in 2004. The brand name is said to have started off with an experimental batch of Chardonnay that had been kept in a barrel with yeast sediment longer than usual and had developed a very full-bodied taste. When Boudinaud tasted the wine, he proclaimed \\"Now that is what you call a fat-bastard wine.\\" The name functions as a bilingual pun, alluding to the buttery taste of the Chardonnay being similar to that of the famous appellation d'origine controlee of B√¢tard- Montrachet. The wine label now carries an apocryphal claim that it was \\"named after a British expression describing a particularly rich and full wine\\". The brand was introduced on the market in 1998. The production run for the first vintage was only 800 cases (about ten thousand 750 ml bottles), but as time passed, the brand became the largest-selling French Chardonnay in the United States. In 2006, 500,000 cases (equivalent to 6 million 750 ml bottles) of the brand were sold in the U.S. market. As of 2016, the brand is no longer sold in the U.K. Wine writers Oz Clarke and James May of the BBC television series Oz and James's Big Wine Adventure said this is \\"simply because these fun-named wines have gone out of fashion\\". However, about 420,000 cases (5 million 750 ml bottles) per year continue to be exported to the United States. Controversies The wine's arguably offensive name has helped to draw attention to the brand, but has also caused some problems in its marketing and distribution. The Advertising Standards Association of Iceland banned the mass-mailing of an advertisement circular that featured the wine on its cover and had been sent to 175,000 homes and a primary school. It said that the product's name was \\"unsuitable to be seen by young children and should not have featured on the outside covers of the circulars\\" that had been \\"distributed to homes in an un-targeted manner\\". The brand was banned in the American states of Texas and Ohio due to its name, but was reported to be available in 22 other U.S. states (as of 2009).

A forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibilities. These statements can often be misleading, as they can be mistaken for factual statements, while they are actually speculation. According to United States Code 15 Section 78u-5, a forward- looking statement may include future economic performance such as revenues or income, plans for future operations, or use of a report written by an outside reviewer.  United States law  Under U.S. law, section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, businesses must comply to standards of communication that limit risk factors. These acts were put into place partially to protect investors from ambiguous language, preventing them from making a poorly informed investment decision based on speculative statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \\"safe harbor\\" for certain forward-looking statements. Businesses usually include a form of a disclaimer that states that any instance of a forward-looking statement found in their material is only true at the time it was written, and they further claim that they are under no obligation to update such written statements if conditions change or that unexpected occurrences happen to affect the statement afterwards. Such forward-looking statements, however, must be identifiable by the use of certain prescribed words. This act allows companies to make speculative statements based on current market trends or research directions without fear of major repercussion, while ensuring that potential investors are informed of the speculative nature of the statements. = Linguistic perspective = Sentences and phrases are forward-looking statements when they include any tense from present to future or similar inflection. Words like \\"believe\\", \\"estimate\\", \\"anticipate\\", \\"plan\\", \\"predict\\", \\"may\\", \\"hope\\", \\"can\\", \\"will\\", \\"should\\", \\"expect\\", \\"intend\\", \\"is designed to\\", \\"with the intent\\", \\"potential\\", the negative of these words or such other variations thereon or comparable terminology, may indicate forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Examples Below are some hypothetical examples of forward-looking statements: *Company X plans on building a new facility in Asia by 2018, expanding our current market share. *We anticipate the value of our company to continue to rise for over the next few years, increasing dividends for shareholders. *We predict that our product will revolutionize the healthcare industry, improving the quality of healthcare for millions of patients.

It is also seen in children, but this is rare. The tumors grow from cells that surround the optic nerve, and as the tumor grows, it compresses the optic nerve. This causes loss of vision in the affected eye. Rarely, it may affect both eyes at the same time. It is typically a slow growing tumor, and has never been reported to cause death. However, there is concern that the tumor can grow into the brain and cause other types of neurological damage. In some patients, the tumor grows so slowly that treatment is not necessary. Standard treatments are observation, surgery, radiation therapy, and combinations of the above. Symptoms MRI of a patient with ONSM The most common symptom of ONSM is a gradual loss of vision in one eye. In a minority of patients this may be intermittent, at least to begin with. Less common symptoms include pain in the affected eye, protrusion of the eye, or double vision. Natural history ONSM does not improve without treatment. In many cases, there is gradual progression until vision is lost in the affected eye. However, this takes at least several months to occur, and a minority of patients remain stable for a number of years. Diagnosis Clinical examination will show an abnormal optic disc, either swollen or atrophic. Optociliary shunt vessels may be seen; the combination of these with progressive visual loss and optic disc atrophy is known as the Hoyt-Spencer triad. Visual acuity is usually but not always reduced. When ONSM is suspected, MRI of the brain or orbits should be performed. This will usually show characteristic findings and confirm the diagnosis. Treatment Most ophthalmologists will not advocate any treatment unless visual loss is present and ongoing. Reports of patients with ONSM having no change in their vision for multiple years are not uncommon. If loss of vision occurs, radiation therapy will improve vision in about ‚Öì of cases, and preserve vision in about ‚Öì of cases. Surgery has traditionally been associated with rapid deteroriation of vision. However, newer surgical techniques may prove better for the treatment of ONSM. Incidence About 1‚Äì2% of all meningiomas are optic nerve sheath meningiomas. Meningiomas have an incidence of ~4.18/100,000 persons each year. Thus, ~10,000 meningiomas are diagnosed in the US each year; corresponding to ~100 cases of ONSM each year in the US. The actual number of meningiomas is likely much higher as it is very common in elderly women. ONSM comprises about 2% of orbital tumors, and about 10% of optic nerve lesions. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF-2) affects around 9% of ONSM patients, where the incidence in the general population is around 0.03‚Äì0.05%. Thus NF-2 is felt to be a risk factor for the development of ONSM.

The current line-up of the band consists of Marco Neves (vocals), Polak (guitar), Didier Br√©ard (sampler), Mathys Dubois (drums) and Syn-Anton (bass); the band went through multiple line-up changes with Neves being the only constant member. The band is named after treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The band's music was described as a mixture of \\"aggressive metal and a hint of industrial\\" similar to Godflesh and The Young Gods.  History  Treponem Pal formed in France in 1986. Their first (Treponem Pal) and third (Excess & Overdrive) albums were produced by Franz Treichler (The Young Gods). Their second, Aggravation was produced by Roli Mosimann (Swans, Wiseblood). This album represents a highly focused achievement, combining Neves' bleak worldview and gift for striking lyrics with the band's controlled aggression, comparable to US bands Chrome and Prong. It was their third album, however, which was to prove most popular with fans. Live performances were extraordinary affairs. Their policy of employing two bass players gave them a massive sound, Michel Bassin was a gifted guitarist (he played with Ministry on one of their US tours) and Marco Neves is a physically imposing performer. They maintained this style up until fourth album Higher, by which time the focus had shifted towards sampling and electronics, giving that album a more techno feel. Higher was produced by Sascha Konietzko from KMFDM. The band then broke up, though vocalist Marco Neves and several other members formed a new band called Elephant System, which released one album produced by On-U Sound's Adrian Sherwood. This reflected Neves' longstanding interest in Jamaican and European dub as well as his work as a DJ and MC with the Dub Action Sound System and his involvement with the Hammerbass record label. Bass player Goran Juresic went in a more industrial dub direction with the band Lab¬∞ while drummer Didier Serbourdin formed the ultra-aggressive band Fast Forward which combined hardcore techno beats with high-octane metal guitars. Treponem Pal returned with a new album in March 2008, entitled Weird Machine. The album featured Ted Parsons (from Swans and Prong) on drums and Paul Raven (from Killing Joke, Ministry and Prong) on bass, though tragically Raven suffered heart failure and died while collaborating with the band on the French-Swiss border. The album combined their earlier aggressive sound with more \\"rock\\" pieces as well as some \\"industrial ballads\\". The album was produced by David Weber and mastered by Maor Appelbaum.

She was the first woman to hold a ministerial position in an Italian government.https://www.ildubbio.news/2020/03/12/quando-tina-anselmi-diede- allitalia-il-servizio-sanitario-nazionale/ Early life Anselmi was born in Castelfranco Veneto, Treviso. Her father was an assistant pharmacist persecuted by the fascists because he was socialist, and her mother and grandmother ran an inn together. She attended the local high school, and then the Teaching Institute in Bassano del Grappa. On 26 September 1944, Nazi soldiers forced her and a group of other students to witness the hanging of a group of 31 young Partisans. As a result, she joined the Italian Resistance movement and became part of the Cesare Battisti brigade. That year, she also joined the Christian Democracy Party. After World War II, she studied literature at the Catholic University of Milan and became a primary school teacher. Political career While working as a teacher, Anselmi held positions in Christian trade unions, including the primary teachers' union from 1948-55. In 1959, she joined the national council of the Christian Democracy Party, and she was the party's deputy leader from 1968-92. In 1963, she was elected vice-president of the Female Board of the European Union. From 1958-64, she was head of the Christian Democracy party's youth programmes. From 1968 to 1987, she was a Member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, re- elected five times in the Venice-Treviso district. She served three times as undersecretary to the Department of Labour and Social Services, and in 1976 she became the first woman to be a member of an Italian cabinet, being chosen by Giulio Andreotti as Minister for Labour and Social Security. She held this position from 1976-79. She served as Minister for Health from 1978 to 1979. Anselmi is best known for having been the main proposer of Italian laws on equal opportunities, a matter she always fought for in her political life. For example in 1977, she passed a bill which recognized fathers as primary caregivers for their children, and allowed for both fathers and mothers to have time away from their children. In the same year, a major piece of legislation was passed on gender parity in employment conditions, of which Anselmi was a key supporter. She chaired the National Equal Opportunities Commission until 1994, and played a significant role in the introduction of Italy's National Health Service. In 1981, she headed the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the illegal P2 Masonic Lodge (Commissione parlamentare d‚Äôinchiesta sulla Loggia massonica P2); the lodge, at the time, was considered a threat to society. Anselmi wrote the commission's final majority report that was approved in 1984, and all activity of the lodge ceased the following year. Anselmi was the chair of a commission of inquiry into the work of Italian soldiers in Somalia, and of a national commission on the consequences of laws for the Italian Jewish community. She was an honorary vice president of the National Institute for the History of the Liberation Movement in Italy. Later in her life, she began to write about her experiences in the Resistance; in 2003, she wrote Zia, cos'√® la Resistenza? (Auntie, what's the Resistance?), a book explaining the Italian Resistance to young people. In 2004, she wrote a second book for young people, titled Bella ciao: la resistenza raccontata ai ragazzi (Hey beautiful: the Resistance explained to children). In 2006, she published her memoir together with Anna Vinci, as Storia Di Una Passione Politica (Story of a Passion for Politics). Death Anselmi died at home in Castelfranco Veneto, Treviso, on 31 October 2016, aged 89. =Recognition and awards= On 18 June 1998, Anselmi was awarded the Knight's Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. In June 2016, Anselmi was featured on an Italian postage stamp, the only living person to be honoured in this way.

History The force was founded in 1839, six hours after Wiltshire Constabulary, making it the second rural police force formed in Britain. The force in its present form dates from 1 April 1974, when the southern part of Gloucestershire became part of the County of Avon and thus covered by the newly formed Avon and Somerset Constabulary. In 1965, the force had an establishment of 1,010 and an actual strength of 867.The Thin Blue Line, Police Council for Great Britain Staff Side Claim for Undermanning Supplements, 1965 From 2013 to 2019, specialist teams ‚Äì roads, firearms and police dogs ‚Äì operated in a \\"tri-force\\" collaboration with the Avon and Somerset, and Wiltshire forces. Structure From April 2011, policing in the county is delivered through six Local Policing Areas: Cheltenham, Gloucester, Forest of Dean, Cotswolds, Stroud and Tewkesbury. Each of these areas is commanded by a superintendent. Within the six areas there are nine Local Policing Teams covering 55 communities: two each in Cheltenham, Gloucester and Stroud and one in Tewkesbury, the Forest and the Cotswolds.

Nowak was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment and 7 years' disqualification from driving, for Death by Dangerous Driving, Conspiring to Pervert the Course of Justice and Driving whilst Disqualified. Race and sex discrimination in recruitment In November 2006, a tribunal ruled that the constabulary had illegally discriminated against 108 white male candidates it had rejected from its recruitment process solely because of their race and gender. Matt Powell, one of the \\"randomly deselected\\" candidates, took legal action and was awarded ¬£2,500 compensation. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) and the Equal Opportunities Commission who led the investigation stated that the Gloucestershire Police had unlawfully discriminated on the grounds of race and gender.

His paternal grandparents were Thomas Smyth, Bishop of Limerick, and Dorothea Burgh (daughter of Ulysses Burgh), and his paternal uncles included the lawyer George Smyth and Arthur Smyth, Archbishop of Dublin. His maternal grandparents were Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet, who was killed in action at the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709, and Penelope Cadogan, sister of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan. In 1760 Gort succeeded to the estates of his maternal uncle Thomas Prendergast, 2nd Baronet, and assumed the surname of Prendergast in lieu of Smyth.

Tharg's Future Shocks is a long-running series of short strips in the British weekly comic 2000 AD in 1977. The name originates from the fictional editor of 2000 AD and the book titled Future Shock, written by Alvin Toffler, published in 1970. Publishing history The series began in issue 25 of 2000 AD titled \\"Tharg's Future Shocks\\" in a single short story written by Steve Moore, who also created the format. This established the pattern of the series which would be two- or three-page short stories, which were normally self-contained. These stories would be a testing ground for new artists and writers and creators resulting in the stories having a very mixed level of quality. Some successful authors such as Peter Milligan, Alan Davis, Alan Moore, and Grant Morrison found some of their earliest work published as Future Shocks. =Spin-offs= Some characters proved popular enough to either appear in their own stories, or have multiple appearances in Future Shocks, such as Alec Trench, Bradley, D.R. and Quinch and Abelard Snazz. =Similar series= 2000 AD also began several other science fiction and horror short stories under several different titles, including Time Twisters.

Instead data are evaluated as they are collected, and further sampling is stopped in accordance with a pre-defined stopping rule as soon as significant results are observed. Thus a conclusion may sometimes be reached at a much earlier stage than would be possible with more classical hypothesis testing or estimation, at consequently lower financial and/or human cost.  History  The method of sequential analysis is first attributed to Abraham Wald with Jacob Wolfowitz, W. Allen Wallis, and Milton Friedman while at Columbia University's Statistical Research Group as a tool for more efficient industrial quality control during World War II. Its value to the war effort was immediately recognised, and led to its receiving a \\"restricted\\" classification. At the same time, George Barnard led a group working on optional stopping in Great Britain. Another early contribution to the method was made by K.J. Arrow with D. Blackwell and M.A. Girshick. A similar approach was independently developed from first principles at about the same time by Alan Turing, as part of the Banburismus technique used at Bletchley Park, to test hypotheses about whether different messages coded by German Enigma machines should be connected and analysed together. This work remained secret until the early 1980s. Peter Armitage introduced the use of sequential analysis in medical research, especially in the area of clinical trials. Sequential methods became increasingly popular in medicine following Stuart Pocock's work that provided clear recommendations on how to control Type 1 error rates in sequential designs.  Alpha spending functions  When researchers repeatedly analyze data as more observations are added, the probability of a Type 1 error increases. Therefore, it is important to adjust the alpha level at each interim analysis, such that the overall Type 1 error rate remains at the desired level. This is conceptually similar to using the Bonferroni correction, but because the repeated looks at the data are dependent, more efficient corrections for the alpha level can be used. Among the earliest proposals is the Pocock boundary. Alternative ways to control the Type 1 error rate exist, such as the Haybittle-Peto bounds, and additional work on determining the boundaries for interim analyses has been done by O‚ÄôBrien & Fleming and Wang & Tsiatis. A limitation of corrections such as the Pocock boundary is that the number of looks at the data must be determined before the data is collected, and that the looks at the data should be equally spaced (e.g., after 50, 100, 150, and 200 patients). The alpha spending function approach developed by Demets & Lan does not have these restrictions, and depending on the parameters chosen for the spending function, can be very similar to Pocock boundaries or the corrections proposed by O'Brien and Fleming.  Applications of sequential analysis  = Clinical trials = In a randomized trial with two treatment groups, group sequential testing may for example be conducted in the following manner: After n subjects in each group are available an interim analysis is conducted. A statistical test is performed to compare the two groups and if the null hypothesis is rejected the trial is terminated; otherwise, the trial continues, another n subjects per group are recruited, and the statistical test is performed again, including all subjects. If the null is rejected, the trial is terminated, and otherwise it continues with periodic evaluations until a maximum number of interim analyses have been performed, at which point the last statistical test is conducted and the trial is discontinued. = Other applications = Sequential analysis also has a connection to the problem of gambler's ruin that has been studied by, among others, Huygens in 1657. Step detection is the process of finding abrupt changes in the mean level of a time series or signal. It is usually considered as a special kind of statistical method known as change point detection. Often, the step is small and the time series is corrupted by some kind of noise, and this makes the problem challenging because the step may be hidden by the noise. Therefore, statistical and/or signal processing algorithms are often required. When the algorithms are run online as the data is coming in, especially with the aim of producing an alert, this is an application of sequential analysis.  Bias  Trials that are terminated early because they reject the null hypothesis typically overestimate the true effect size. This is because in small samples, only large effect size estimates will lead to a significant effect, and the subsequent termination of a trial. Methods to correct effect size estimates in single trials have been proposed. Note that this bias is mainly problematic when interpreting single studies. In meta-analyses, overestimated effect sizes due to early stopping are balanced by underestimation in trials that stop late, leading Schou & Marschner to conclude that \\"early stopping of clinical trials is not a substantive source of bias in meta-analyses\\". The meaning of p-values in sequential analyses also changes, because when using sequential analyses, more than one analysis is performed, and the typical definition of a p-value as the data ‚Äúat least as extreme‚Äù as is observed needs to be redefined. One solution is to order the p-values of a series of sequential tests based on the time of stopping and how high the test statistic was at a given look, which is known as stagewise ordering, first proposed by Armitage.

Past infection with the BK virus is widespread, but significant consequences of infection are uncommon, with the exception of the immunocompromised and the immunosuppressed. BK virus is an abbreviation of the name of the first patient whom the virus was isolated from in 1971 (the patient was then 29 years old). Signs and symptoms The BK virus rarely causes disease but is typically associated with patients who have had a kidney transplant; many people who are infected with this virus are asymptomatic. If symptoms do appear, they tend to be mild: respiratory infection or fever. These are known as primary BK infections. Although without any clinical symptoms, footprints of BK virus have been detected in specimens from females affected by spontaneous abortion. Serum antibodies against BK virus have also been found in spontaneous abortion affected women as well as in women who underwent voluntary interruption of pregnancy. The virus then disseminates to the kidneys and urinary tract where it persists for the life of the individual. It is thought that up to 80% of the population contains a latent form of this virus, which remains latent until the body undergoes some form of immunosuppression. Typically, this is in the setting of kidney transplantation or multi-organ transplantation. Presentation in these immunocompromised individuals is much more severe. Clinical manifestations include renal dysfunction (seen by a progressive rise in serum creatinine), and an abnormal urinalysis revealing renal tubular cells and inflammatory cells. Cause =Transmission= It is not known how this virus is transmitted. It is known, however, that the virus is spread from person to person, and not from an animal source. It has been suggested that this virus may be transmitted through respiratory fluids or urine, since infected individuals periodically excrete virus in the urine. A survey of 400 healthy blood donors was reported as showing that 82% were positive for IgG against BK virus. =Risk factors= In some renal transplant patients, the necessary use of immunosuppressive drugs has the side-effect of allowing the virus to replicate within the graft, a disease called BK nephropathy. From 1‚Äì10% of renal transplant patients progress to BK virus associated nephropathy (BKVAN) and up to 80% of these patients lose their grafts. The onset of nephritis can occur as early as several days post-transplant to as late as 5 years. It is also associated with ureteral stenosis and interstitial nephritis. In bone marrow transplant recipients it is notable as a cause for hemorrhagic cystitis. BK viremia load > 185 000 copies/ml at the time of first positive BKV diagnosis - to be the strongest predictor for BKVAN (97% specificity and 75% sensitivity). In addition the BKV peak viral loads in blood reaching 223 000 copies/ml at any time was found to be predictive for BKVAN (91% specificity and 88% sensitivity) . Diagnosis This virus can be diagnosed by a BKV blood test or a urine test for decoy cells, in addition to carrying out a biopsy in the kidneys. PCR techniques are often carried out to identify the virus. Treatment The cornerstone of therapy is reduction in immunosuppression. A recent surge in BKVAN correlates with use of potent immunosuppressant drugs, such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Studies have not shown any correlation between BKVAN and a single immunosuppressive agent but rather the overall immunosuppressive load. * No guidelines or drug levels and doses exist for proper reduction of immunosuppressants in BKVAN * Most common methods: # Withdrawal of MMF or tacrolimus # Replacement of tacrolimus by cyclosporine # Overall reduction of immunosuppressive load # Some cyclosporine trough levels reported to be reduced to 100‚Äì150 ng/ml and tacrolimus levels reduced to 3‚Äì5 ng/ml * Retrospective analysis of 67 patients concluded graft survival was similar between reduction and discontinuation of agents. * Single center study showed renal allografts were preserved in 8/8 individuals managed with reduction in immunosuppression while graft loss occurred in 8/12 patients treated with an increase in therapy for what was thought to be organ rejection. Other therapeutic options include Leflunomide, Cidofovir, IVIG, and the fluoroquinolones. Leflunomide, a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor is now generally accepted as the second treatment option behind reduction of immunosuppression. =Leflunomide in BKVAN= The rationale behind using leflunomide in BKVAN comes from its combined immunosuppressive and antiviral properties. Two studies consisting of 26 and 17 patients who developed BKVAN on a three-drug regimen of tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids had their MMF replaced with leflunomide 20‚Äì60 mg daily. 84 and 88% of patients, respectively had clearance or a progressive reduction in viral load and a stabilization or improvement of graft function (7). In a study conducted by Teschner et al. in 2009, 12/13 patients who had their MMF exchanged with leflunomide cleared the virus by 109 days. In a case series, there was improvement or stabilization in 23/26 patients with BKVAN after switching MMF to leflunomide. There are no dosing guidelines for leflunomide in BKVAN. Patient to patient variability has made dosing and monitoring of leflunomide extremely difficult. * Study of 26 and 17 patients were dosed between 20 mg/day and 60 mg/day with trough levels of 50‚Äî100 ¬µg/ml. Failure was seen in patients with leflunomide plasma levels < 40 ¬µg/ml. * One study of 21 patients found that low levels (< 40 ¬µg/ml) and high levels (> 40 ¬µg/ml) had similar effects on the rate of viral clearance. Those with higher levels had more adverse events (hematologic, hepatic). * In the study by Teschner et al., dosages and drug concentration showed no correlation with substantial variation from person to person. * In the Teschner study, low drug concentrations were associated with decrease in viral load. This makes it difficult to determine whether or not reduction of viral load or addition of leflunomide was the cause for viral clearance. =Other treatment options= *Quinolone antibiotics: Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) was shown to significantly lower viral loads but no data on survival and graft loss exist. *Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has use in the treatment of infection and allograft rejection ‚Äì hard to distinguish *Cidofovir has limited data and is highly nephrotoxic. History The BK virus was first isolated in 1971 from the urine of a renal transplant patient, initials B.K. The BK virus is similar to another virus called the JC virus (JCV), since their genomes share 75% sequence similarity. Both of these viruses can be identified and differentiated from each other by carrying out serological tests using specific antibodies or by using a PCR-based genotyping approach.

Gallaher Joseph Wesley Gallaher (23 August 1826 ‚Äì 31 May 1892)Joseph Wesley Gallaher at billiongraves.com was a successful businessman of Moundsville, West Virginia, who held prominence in affairs of state and local politics and government. Early life Gallaher was born in Ohio County, West Virginia to John and Rachel (Hurst) Gallaher, natives of Ireland and Maryland, respectively. In 1834, Mr. Gallaher came to Moundsville, and was educated in the common schools and the academy of Revs. Nicholas Murray and Irwin Carson. Business He embarked in business on his own account in 1848 and was still running the business in 1890. The business sold wool and grain. He had a reputation for strength of character and integrity and his business made him prosperous. Political life The same qualities, added to an unfailing tact in dealing with men, and fluency as a public speaker, brought him to great prominence in the political life of West Virginia. His first public office was serving as a member in the county court of Virginia for six years. He later became the mayor of Moundsville, and in 1856, was on the ticket of Millard Fillmore as a candidate for presidential elector for the Fifteenth District of Virginia. After the American Civil War he was among the first who resolved upon the reorganization of the Democratic Party of West Virginia as a controlling influence in the state. He also served as a member, secretary, and treasurer of the first state executive committee for ten to twelve years, and he was a power in the organization of his party. In 1868, he was a delegate and vice president from Virginia to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour, and in 1872, with Judge A. F. Haymond, represented the second senatorial district in the constitutional convention of West Virginia, which framed the present constitution of the state. He served on the committees on taxation, finance, corporations, education and schedule. In 1876 he was appointed one of the committee of three to equalize the state assessment of lands by Governor John J. Jacob. Gallaher served as president of the board of directors of the West Virginia penitentiary for ten years. His readiness and tact as a speaker was frequently called upon; in 1869, he was called to visit Columbus, Ohio to present Judge Thurman with a fine goldheaded cane. Mr. Gallaher also was socially popular. He married Emily J., daughter of Col. John Thompson of Belmont County, Ohio, in November, 1866 and had two children: John T. and Joseph W. Religion In regard to religion, he was an attendant of the Episcopal Church, of which his wife was a member and he, a vestryman.

Northumberland Coast Country Park is situated on the bay, and part of the bay (the section near the farmstead of Druridge, in the centre of the bay) is owned by the National Trust. Coastal areas on the bay are set aside as nature reserves. Wartime defences During World War II, defences were constructed around Druridge Bay as part of the anti-invasion preparations. The defences included scaffolding barriers and anti-tank blocks overlooked by pillboxes; behind these were minefields and an anti-tank ditch.Foot, 2006, p199. Between the hamlets of Druridge and Cresswell, anti-glider ditches were dug and there is an extant brick-built decoy control. Proposed nuclear reactor The bay was the focus of a long-running campaign against proposals to construct a Pressurised Water Reactor nuclear power station during the 1980s and for the large-scale extraction of sand from the area in the 1990s. The first campaign, along with changes in UK Government policy on nuclear power, prevented the power station from being built: the plan was shelved in 1989. The land was retained by Nuclear Electric and in February 1996 was allocated to the NDA/BNFL. In November 1996 the NDA/BNFL sold the land to farmers. Proposed coal mine Druridge Bay again became the focus for environmental concerns in late 2015, when a planning application was submitted by Banks Group for an open-cast mine extending to 360 hectares (900 acres) immediately to the west of the beach, for the extraction of 3 million tonnes of coal. Six weeks after the application was submitted the UK government announced that all coal-fired energy generation would cease by 2025. Over 1800 letters of objection were received. Northumberland County Council approved plans for the open-cast mine in July 2016. In September 2016, the plans were put on hold subject to a government inquiry. In March 2018, the proposal was formally rejected by the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid. The company behind the project said they were planning to formally challenge the decision in the High Court. In September 2020, the proposal was rejected again by the Secretary of State. Wildlife Northumberland Wildlife Trust purchased the sand extraction site from RMC Group in 2006. The shore is known for populations of birds including the golden plover and the purple sandpiper. Druridge Bay is best known to birdwatchers for hosting, in 1998, the Druridge Bay curlew, a controversial bird which was eventually accepted as the first record of a slender-billed curlew in Britain, although this identification is still disputed by some. Naturism Druridge Bay is also used by naturists. The North East Skinny Dip, first held in 2012, is an annual event to raise funds for MIND, the mental health charity. It is held around the time of the Autumn Equinox in late September each year.

The machine A Brown Bobby machine, open The Brown Bobby machine resembled and operated similar to a waffle iron. Its surfaces were made of aluminium and were prepared for baking by coating with paraffin, though users today would most often use cooking spray. The machine had a high (600 watt/surfaces connected in parallel) and a low (300 watt/surfaces connected in series) setting. Cooking was done on the high setting, the low setting was for allowing the machine to remain idle. Machines were available as either a single (aka Brown Bobby Junior) for US$52 or as two machines riveted together into a single unit for US$100. Since these machines are no longer manufactured they are prized by their owners and often handed down to subsequent generations to continue a tradition of Brown Bobby making, especially during the holidays.

Weaver (born April 11, 1845),(died February 19, 1906), of Moundsville, a notably successful business man, was born in York County, Pennsylvania. His father, Elijah Weaver, a native of Maryland, was a whip manufacturer by occupation, and died in 1878, at the age of sixty-one. By his wife, Caroline Erb, a native of Ireland, he had six children, the oldest of whom is Charles A. The latter embarked in the whip manufacture at the age of twenty, and though burned out in the year 1869, his business became more proportions than before. His establishment manufactured about eighty dozen whips per day, and turned out about half the leather whips used in the United States at one time. In this manufacture he is associated with John C. Bardall under the style of Weaver & Bardall, and he is also a member of the firm of Weaver & Humphreys, manufacturers of brooms, the product of whose establishment is about 125 dozen per day. Mr. Weaver's energies as a manager and financier are not confined to these extensive industries. He is also president of the Marshall County Bank, of which he is a founder. Charles is also a charter member of the Moundsville Coal company and director of the same. He is also a stockholder and director of Citizens' Natural Gas company in Beaver, Pennsylvania. Finally, he has business interests in Wheeling, and at various places in Pennsylvania and the west. His prominence as his election has recognized a citizen to the office of mayor, and he is now a member of the council. Socially he held a high rank, was a Mason of the degree of Knight Templar, and with his wife was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. Few men in West Virginia were more prominent in business and financial circles. His success is creditable, and founded on integrity of character, alertness in affairs and superior executive ability.

History The Mike Fink Keel Boats were based on two episodes of the Davy Crockett miniseries which aired on the Disneyland TV show in 1955 -- \\"Davy Crockett's Keel Boat Race\\" (Nov 16) and \\"Davy Crockett and the River Pirates\\" (December 14). The ride was named after Mike Fink, the \\"King of the River\\" who lost the keel boat race. The two 38-foot boats, the Gullywhumper and the Bertha Mae, were the actual props that had been used in making the TV shows a few months earlier. The boats were free-floating and traveled around Tom Sawyer Island Riders would sit on benches either inside the cabin or on the roof of the cabin. The keelboats at Disneyland closed at the end of the summer on September 6, 1994 and remained closed for nearly a year and a half until coming back in early March 1996. The Magic Kingdom's keel boats ran continuously until they closed in April 2001. Reasons for closing At about 5:30 p.m. on May 17, 1997, the Disneyland Gullywhumper boat began to rock side to side. It capsized, dumping a full boatload of passengers into the Rivers of America, leaving several with minor injuries. The boat was removed from the waters for inspection and neither the Gullywhumper nor the Bertha Mae returned for the next operating season. The Bertha Mae was put up on Disney's eBay Auction Site and was sold for $15,000 to Richard Kraft, and was later featured in a scene from Kraft's documentary Finding Kraftland. It was billed as an unseaworthy craft. The Gullywhumper returned to Disneyland's Rivers of America as a prop and was moored on Tom Sawyer Island where passengers on the Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes, the Sailing Ship Columbia, and the Mark Twain Riverboat could see it while passing. Eventually, hull damage caused the boat to flood and sink, and it was finally removed from public view in April 2009. When the river was drained in 2010, the Gullywhumper was lovingly restored to its 1955 appearance, with some sources claiming that the original had been scrapped and replaced by a replica. A former Mike Fink Keel Boat from the Magic Kingdom's version of the attraction today sits as a non-functional prop on the banks of Tom Sawyer Island. Regarding its status at Disneyland Paris, the attraction does not appear anymore on the Park Guides or Maps. After a short opening during the summer 2010, the attraction is currently closed and hidden from the view of visitors with 'Danger: Bear Cave' signs surrounding it. The reasons for its closure or lack of operation are not clear, but some may suggest the following: small capacity (only two boats) generating great waiting lines, required extensive training to operating Cast Members (first aid, navigation procedures, etc.) and the extremely poor and dirty condition of the Rivers of the Farwest Lake make the Riverboats a non-suitable attraction for Disneyland Paris.

It is located in the northern part of the country in the Balkan mountains and was founded no later than the end of the 16th century. The monastery is situated on the banks of the Cherni Osam near Oreshak, a village 10 km from Troyan in Lovech Province, and is a popular tourist destination. The main church of the monastery was reconstructed near the end of Ottoman rule during the Bulgarian National Revival period by a master-builder called Konstantin in 1835. The ornate interior and exterior of the church were painted between 1847 and 1849 by Zahari Zograph, a popular Bulgarian painter of the time, who also painted the central church of the Rila Monastery, the largest monastery in Bulgaria. Many of the \\"moral and social experiments\\" of art at the time such as Doomsday and Wheel of Life were reproduced at Troyan. One highly controversial move by Zograph was to paint his image around one of the windows in the back of the church. The iconostasis in the central church is a wood carving dating to 1839. The Troyan Monastery is also, since the 17th century, the home of one of the holiest icons in Bulgarian Orthodoxy, the Three-Handed Virgin. Many people make a pilgrimage to this monastery on St. George's Day because of an icon of St. George in the main church. The room, in which Bulgarian revolutionary Vassil Levski was hiding and meeting with other revolutionaries during the Ottoman period is a museum.

It protects diverse coastal habitat, including part of the 220 km¬≤ Igu√©la Lagoon, the only significant example of a typical western African lagoon system that is protected within a national park. Situated between the Nkomi and Ndogo Lagoons, Loango National Park is the true jewel of Africa's western coast. The naturalist Mike Fay called Loango 'Africa's Last Eden' and this is where Michael \\"Nick\\" Nichols from National Geographic took his well-known pictures of surfing hippos. Both men call Loango the 'Land of surfing hippos'. The park‚Äôs 1,550 km¬≤ of savanna, pristine beach, forest and mangroves are a must- see in Gabon. Loango National Park offers extensive panoramas and the opportunity to observe elephants, buffalos, hippos, gorillas and leopards venturing onto the white sand beaches. After South Africa, the world‚Äôs largest concentration and variety of whales and dolphins can be found right off the Loango coast. The area has over 100 kilometres of uninhabited coastline and humpback and killer whales are easy to observe here. This is arguably the most beautiful spot on Africa's western coast ‚Äì the place where forests, savannas, wetlands, lagoons and ocean all come together. Loango is renowned worldwide as a site for tarpon of record size, as well as many other large saltwater fish. The World Conservation Union or International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), an international organization dedicated to natural resource conservation, classed Loango National Park as a faunal reserve and protected area for conservation. History In 1956 the first regional faunal reserves were created in and around Loango National Park to promote sustainable use of the area‚Äôs wildlife and wild lands. In November 2002, President Omar Bongo Ondimba put Gabon firmly on the map by creating 13 new national parks in Gabon. All together, the thirteen parks created represent 10% of the landmass of Gabon. One of the more spectacular parks in this system is Loango National Park. Very few villages currently exist within the park, as most are located on the opposite bank of the Ngove Lagoon. As such, the park is nearly devoid of people and home only to a vast and spectacular array of terrestrial, avian and marine wildlife. While some of these animals inhabit specific ecological niches to which they have been adapting over time immemorial, others such as elephants and buffalos range across a number of landscapes. Many of the animals can be encountered by visitors on foot, in a vehicle, or seen from a blind. Tourism/Conservation Rombout Swanborn, a pioneering Dutch investor in ‚ÄòConservation Tourism‚Äô developed SCD (Soci√©t√© de Conservation de Developpement). Research, park management and educational activities are performed in partnership with WCS. Also, he created Africa‚Äôs Eden, developing the infrastructure and logistics to provide high-end nature tourism experiences in remote parts of Gabon (and from 2006 in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe as well) based on the concept \\"Tourism pays for Conservation\\". People Like most people around the globe, the human inhabitants of the Loango area remain dependent on the natural resources that surround them for their daily needs. Today, although some Gabonese citizens have migrated toward the urban centres or taken up employment within modern industries, such as oil and timber production, most individuals living in traditional villages still depend heavily upon their natural surroundings for their day-to-day needs. Village-dwelling peoples use a slash-and-burn agricultural technique and grow a number of domesticated plant species including manioc, peanuts, and mustard greens. Women are responsible for most of the gardening, save for the preliminary felling and clearing of trees and brush. Men make their living by fishing or hunting. Fishermen use long nets, throw nets, gill nets, long lines, baited hooks, fish traps and spears to catch fish and shrimp. Land crabs are caught by hand. Traditional hunting gear such as bows and arrows, spears, deadfall and spring traps, have been replaced by high-calibre rifles and shotguns. A number of other food products are harvested wild in the forest or savannah or from the beaches, such as turtle eggs.

It walked on two legs, had short front arms, a characteristic ceratopsian frill and beak-like mouth, and was around long. It was one of the first ceratopsians, or horned dinosaurs, along with Psittacosaurus in Mongolia. The type species, Microceratops gobiensis, was first described by Bohlin in 1953. However, the generic name was already preoccupied by an ichneumon wasp (subfamily Gelinae) with the same name. Though much of the material has since been reassigned to the genus Graciliceratops, a replacement name Microceratus was created by Mateus in 2008 for the type specimen. Classification Microceratus belonged to the Ceratopsia (Ancient Greek for \\"horned face\\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. All ceratopsians became extinct at the end of this era. Diet Microceratus, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles.

The disease can occur as a complication of cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and radiation therapy. In addition to hemorrhagic cystitis, temporary hematuria can also be seen in bladder infection or in children as a result of viral infection. Causes Causes of hemorrhagic cystitis include chemotherapy (e.g. cyclophosphamide, Ifosfamide), radiation, or infection. Ifosfamide is the most common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis. Radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis develops in similar or smaller patient numbers when compared to cyclophosphamide-induced cases. Adenovirus (particularly serotypes 11 and 21 of subgroup B) is the most common cause of acute viral hemorrhagic cystitis in children, though it can result from BK virus as well. A chemical hemorrhagic cystitis can develop when vaginal products are inadvertently placed in the urethra. Gentian violet douching to treat candidiasis has resulted in hemorrhagic cystitis when the drug was misplaced in the urethra, but this hemorrhagic cystitis resolved spontaneously with cessation of treatment. Accidental urethral placement of contraceptive suppositories has also caused hemorrhagic cystitis in several patients. The bladder irritation was thought to be caused by the spermicidal detergent nonoxynol-9. In the acute setting, the bladder can be copiously irrigated with alkalinized normal saline to minimize bladder irritation. Although hemorrhagic cystitis post-transplantation/bone marrow transplantation is not technically infectious, a short discussion is in order for completeness. Patients undergoing therapy to suppress the immune system are at risk for hemorrhagic cystitis due to either the direct effects of chemotherapy or activation of dormant viruses in the kidney, ureter, or bladder. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by history and examination. In immunocompromised patients, pus is present in the urine but often no organism can be cultured. In children, polymerase chain reaction sequencing of urine can detect fragments of the infectious agent. The procedure differs somewhat for women and men. Laboratory testing of urine samples now can be performed with dipsticks that indicate immune system responses to infection, as well as with microscopic analysis of samples. Normal human urine is sterile. The presence of bacteria or pus in the urine usually indicates infection, although asymptomatic bacteria in the urine is a common finding in older adults (e.g. over 65 and increasing with advancing age). The presence of hematuria, or blood in the urine, may indicate acute UTIs, kidney disease, kidney stones, inflammation of the prostate (in men), endometriosis (in women), or cancer of the urinary tract. In some cases, blood in the urine results from athletic training, particularly in runners. Treatment Unfortunately mesna is ineffective as a treatment once hemorrhagic cystitis has developed. Although rare, once a case of radiation- induced hemorrhagic cystitis is diagnosed there is no empirically-proven treatments to heal this type of condition, which can severely degrade a patient's quality of life and might possibly lead to kidney failure with risk of death. Viral hemorrhagic cystitis in children generally spontaneously resolves within a few days. The first step in the treatment of HC should be directed toward clot evacuation. Bladder outlet obstruction from clots can lead to urosepsis, bladder rupture, and kidney failure. Clot evacuation can be performed by placing a wide-lumen bladder catheter at bedside. The bladder can be irrigated with water or sodium chloride solution. The use of water is preferable because water can help with clot lysis. Care must be taken to not overdistend the bladder and cause a perforation. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy has been proven to be effective in treating radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.Kian Tai Chong, Neil B. Hampson, and John M.

The film is a triptych of stories involving foreign protagonists, unfolding over the course of the same night. \\"Far from Yokohama\\" features a Japanese couple (Youki Kudoh and Masatoshi Nagase) on a cultural pilgrimage, \\"A Ghost\\" focuses on an Italian widow (Nicoletta Braschi) stranded in the city overnight, and \\"Lost in Space\\" follows the misadventures of a newly single and unemployed Englishman (Joe Strummer) and his reluctant companions (Rick Aviles and Steve Buscemi). The narratives are linked by a run-down flophouse overseen by a night clerk (Screamin' Jay Hawkins) and his disheveled bellboy (Cinqu√© Lee), the use of Elvis Presley's song \\"Blue Moon\\", and a gunshot. The starting point for the script was the ensemble cast of friends and previous collaborators Jarmusch had conceived characters for, while the tripartite formal structure of the film was inspired by his study of literary forms. Cinematographer Robby M√ºller and musician John Lurie were among the many contributors who had been involved in earlier Jarmusch projects and returned to work on the film. Mystery Trains US$2.8 million budget (financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC) was considerable compared to what the director had enjoyed before, and allowed him the freedom to rehearse many unscripted background scenes. It was the first of Jarmusch's feature films since Permanent Vacation to depart from his trademark black-and- white photography, though the use of color was tightly controlled to conform with the director's intuitive sense of the film's aesthetic.. Mystery Train was released theatrically by Orion Classics under a restricted rating in the United States, where it grossed over $1.5 million. It enjoyed critical acclaim on the film festival circuit, and like the director's earlier films premiered at the New York Film Festival and was shown in competition at Cannes, where Jarmusch was awarded the Best Artistic Achievement Award. The film was also shown in the Edinburgh, London, Midnight Sun, Telluride, and Toronto film festivals, and was nominated in six categories at the Independent Spirit Awards. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the structure, humor, and characters of the film, though there was criticism that the director had not been sufficiently adventurous. Plot The film consists of three stories that take place on the same night in downtown Memphis. The three stories are linked together by the Arcade Hotel, a run-down flophouse presided over by a night clerk (Screamin' Jay Hawkins) and a bellboy (Cinqu√© Lee), where the principal characters in each story spend a part of the night. Every room in the hotel lacks a television (as is noted in each story) but is adorned with a portrait of Elvis Presley. The first story, \\"Far from Yokohama\\", features Mitsuko (Youki Kudoh) and Jun (Masatoshi Nagase), a teenage couple from Yokohama making a pilgrimage to Memphis during a trip across America. Mitsuko is obsessed with Elvis, and has put together a scrapbook detailing her belief that the singer has a mystical connection to other cultural figures ranging from Madonna to the Buddha to the Statue of Liberty. The story follows the couple as they travel from the train station, through downtown Memphis and a tour of Sun Records, to the Arcade hotel, before they eventually depart to board the train again. The second story, \\"A Ghost\\", is about an Italian widow, Luisa (Nicoletta Braschi), who is stranded in Memphis while escorting her husband's coffin back to Italy. Luisa shares a room at the hotel with Dee Dee (Elizabeth Bracco), a young woman who has just left her British boyfriend (Johnny from the final story) and plans to leave the city in the morning. Luisa is kept awake by Dee Dee's constant talking. After Dee Dee finally goes to sleep, Luisa is visited by an apparition of Elvis Presley. The final story, \\"Lost in Space\\", introduces Johnny (Joe Strummer). Upset after losing his job and his girlfriend (Dee Dee), Johnny ‚Äì called Elvis, much to his chagrin ‚Äì drunkenly brandishes a gun in a bar before leaving with his friend Will Robinson (Rick Aviles) and his ex-girlfriend's brother, Charlie (Steve Buscemi), who believes Johnny to be his brother-in- law. They stop at a liquor store, which Johnny robs, shooting its clerk (Rockets Redglare) in the process. Fearing the consequences, Johnny, Will and Charlie retire to the hotel to hide out for the night; there, they all become increasingly intoxicated. Charlie realizes that Will shares the same name as the character Will Robinson from the television show Lost in Space, which Johnny has never heard of. Charlie and Johnny proceed to tell him about the show, and Will comments that the title describes how he feels then with Charlie and Johnny: lost in space. The next morning, Charlie discovers that Johnny isn't really his brother-in-law, which angers him because of what they've been through. Johnny attempts to shoot himself, and while struggling to prevent him, Charlie is accidentally shot in the leg. Leaving the hotel, the three rush to escape a police car that isn't even looking for them. The closing credits show the train, the airport and final views of the characters from the first two stories.

(voice) Production =Script and casting= Jarmusch wrote the script for the film under the working title \\"One Night in Memphis\\", without ever having been to the southern city. The idea for \\"Far from Yokohama\\", the first segment, he took from a one-act play he had been writing before filming Down by Law (1986). The play ‚Äì unrelated to Elvis or Memphis ‚Äì concerned a constantly argumentative young couple, one of whom gradually comes to realize that their fighting is a unifying force in the relationship. The interconnected stories were inspired by Jarmusch's dwelling on literary forms, and specifically the work of Chaucer, Italian episodic films and Japanese ghost story cinema. As with his other films, Jarmusch's starting point for writing Mystery Train was the actors and characters he had foremost in mind. The great number of these collaborators contributed to it being \\"the most complicated film to write and execute\\" according to the director. The role of Johnny was written by Jarmusch specifically for Joe Strummer, who had been the frontman of The Clash, the director's favorite 1980s rock band. Jarmusch had conceived the part a few years previously while the two were together in Spain, and although the musician had been in a period of depression at the time following the collapse of the band, he was drawn by the Memphis setting of the film. Unlike the jovial Steve Buscemi, Strummer did not stay on set to joke with the veteran actors between shots, but instead preferred to keep his own company, focusing intensively on orienting himself to the role. Jarmusch had met blues singer Screamin' Jay Hawkins after featuring his music prominently in his breakthrough feature Stranger Than Paradise (1984). Although reticent about acting, Hawkins responded favorably to the director's offer to appear. The part of Luisa was also written by the director with the star ‚Äì actress Nicoletta Braschi ‚Äì in mind; the two had previously collaborated on Down by Law (1986). Cinqu√© Lee is the younger brother of director Spike Lee, a longtime friend of Jarmusch from their days at New York University's film school, while Youki Kudoh was cast after the director saw her performance in S≈çgo Ishii's The Crazy Family (1984) while promoting Down by Law in Japan. Repeat Jarmusch collaborators who worked on the film included John Lurie who provided the original music, cinematographer Robby M√ºller, and singer Tom Waits, who in a voice appearance reprised his role of radio DJ Lee Baby Sims from Down by Law. Other cameos include Jarmusch's long-time girlfriend Sara Driver as an airport clerk, Rufus Thomas as the man in the train station who greets the Japanese couple, Rockets Redglare as the clerk of the liquor store, Vondie Curtis-Hall as Ed, Sy Richardson as the news vendor, and Richard Boes and Tom Noonan as diner patrons. =Filming= Mystery Train was filmed in Memphis in the summer of 1988. After arriving in the city during a snowstorm to scout for shooting locations, Jarmusch drove around without direction before coming to the intersection of a disused train station, the Arcade Luncheonette diner, and the dilapidated Arcade Hotel that would become the film's core setting. He would later recount the experience in a March 1990 interview in Spin: \\"Man, ... this crossroad is filled with so many ghosts. You know Robert Johnson walked down that street, you know Muddy Waters was in that train station.\\" The locale of the intersection was one of the film's primary formal elements; the effect of Jarmusch returning to the setting with different characters under different circumstances was one of the variations on a theme. Jarmusch chose a cool palette for the film, accentuated with an occasional jolt of red as shown here by the suit of the Night Clerk (Screamin' Jay Hawkins) contrasted with the muted background of the hotel lobby. The film was shot in bright, primary colors rather than the black-and-white of the director's previous features, but it retained his usual languid pacing. Jarmusch characterized the color choice as \\"intuitive\\". He deliberately chose a cool color palette, eschewing yellows and oranges and using only sporadic dashes of red (as in the Japanese couple's ubiquitous suitcase). This motif of flashes of red was later described by Suzanne Scott of Reverse Shot as \\"giving the impression of a failed attempt to grab a bit of Elvis's glamor and try it on for size, only to inevitably discover that it looks cartoonish out of context\\". Stills from the film as well as on-location shots of the actors and the film crew by photographer Masayoshi Sukita were published to accompany the film as the photo collection Mystery Train: A Film by Jim Jarmusch. Mystery Train was the first American independent film to be financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC, and was produced on a budget ‚Äì $2.8 million ‚Äì that was considerable by Jarmusch's modest standards. The company was enthusiastic about underwriting the film despite the director insisting on retaining full creative control, and went on to fund his next three features. The substantial budget and time available gave Jarmusch the opportunity to shoot in color and to rehearse with the actors many scenes not in the script, including several from the courtship of Mitsuko and Jun. At a Memphis nightclub with the Japanese actors during production, the director had Masatoshi Nagase ‚Äì who spoke little English but was an accomplished mimic ‚Äì try chat-up lines on the female clientele as an acting exercise. Jarmusch took advantage of the production to make the second installment of his Coffee and Cigarettes series, a collection of short vignettes featuring acquaintances of the director sitting about drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. The \\"Memphis Version\\", titled Twins, starred bickering twins Cinqu√© and Joie Lee alongside Steve Buscemi as an obtuse waiter who expounds his theory of Elvis having an evil twin to a hostile reception.  Release  The film had its domestic premiere at the 27th New York Film Festival in 1989, thereby emulating the director's previous features Stranger Than Paradise in 1984, and Down by Law in 1986. The Miami Herald declared it the \\"quiet triumph\\" of the festival. The film was picked up for theatrical distribution by Orion Classics in the United States, where it was released under an R-rating due to scenes featuring brief nudity and strong language. Its total domestic gross was $1,541,218, making it the 153rd highest-grossing film of 1989, and the 70th highest R-rated film of the year. Internationally, it was first shown in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival on May 13 and 14, 1989, and subsequently featured in the Edinburgh, London, Midnight Sun, Telluride and Toronto film festivals. Mystery Train was released on DVD on March 28, 2000 with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1/2 surround sound. The DVD release was criticized by Anna Lazowski of allmovie who awarded it two stars out of five compared to four for the film itself, citing the paltry special features of 24 scene selections and a collectible behind-the-scenes booklet. A Criterion Collection DVD and Blu- ray were released on June 15, 2010, utilizing a new restored high-definition digital transfer.  Critical reception  Like Jarmusch's previous films, Mystery Train enjoyed a warm reception from critics. This was particularly evident at Cannes, where the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or and Jarmusch was commended for the festival's Best Artistic Achievement. It was nominated in six categories at the 1989 Independent Spirit Awards: Best Picture, Best Screenplay (Jim Jarmusch), Best Director (Jim Jarmusch), Best Cinematography (Robby M√ºller), Best Actress (Youki Kudoh), and Best Supporting Actor (Steve Buscemi and Screamin' Jay Hawkins). Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ira Robbins gave the film a B+ rating, complimenting it as \\"conceptually ambitious\\" and concluding that its \\"offbeat characters, fine cinematography, and novel structure make for entertaining viewing\\". Robert Fulford of The National Post hailed it as \\"eccentric and deliriously funny\\", while Rolling Stones Phil Whitman remarked that the director's \\"bracing, original comedy may be mostly smoke and air, but it's not insubstantial\\". In The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it \\"thoroughly fascinating, a delight\\" and the director's best effort to date, drawing note to its retention of the \\"same kind of dour, discordant charm\\" exhibited by Stranger Than Paradise. He praised Jarmusch's development as a screenwriter ‚Äì citing the restrained dialogue, humor and subtlety of the narrative and the careful construction of the plot ‚Äì and the performances he elicited from the ensemble cast. John Hartl, in The Seattle Times, also drew a comparison with Stranger Than Paradise, judging Mystery Train to be the more accessible work while retaining the dry wit of its predecessor. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was unimpressed with the film, calling it Jarmusch's \\"least engaging, and the first in which his bohemian posturing actually becomes an irritant\\". Of the film's characters, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that some were \\"beautifully imagined and realized, while others seem drawn from a more familiar stockpile, designed for reuse rather than discovery\\". David Denby, concluding a mixed review of the film for New York Magazine, mused that \\"one feels Jarmusch has pushed hipsterism and cool about as far as they can go, and that isn't nearly far enough.\\" This reproach was echoed by other reviewers who found that the film's style did not stray far from that of the director's earlier work ‚Äì a critical backlash that would be amplified two years later following the release of Night On Earth (1991). Postmodern cultural critic bell hooks cited the interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple as one of the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that \\"[t]he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look.\\" He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was \\"as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance\\".

The \\"oeil du prince\\" seat is shown approximately at the middle of the audience How the exact spot of \\"l'oeil du prince\\" is calculated. The vertical stem of the \\"T\\" is equal to the width of the stage Theater room of the Palais-Royal, showing Louis XIII, Anne of Austria and Cardinal Richelieu positioned at \\"l'≈ìil du prince\\" L'≈ìil du prince (; ) is a French expression popularized by Nicola Sabbatini (1574‚Äì1654), an Italian stage designer and architect of the Renaissance in his famous treatise published in 1638. It is an imaginary point in the audience of a theatre, located in its central axis, approximately 0.6 m (18 inches) above the stage, and at a distance equal to the stage's width. In most theaters it corresponds more or less to the seventh row of seats. Sabbatini, in a chapter in his book, describes ‚ÄòHow to Place the Prince‚Äôs Seat‚Äô, where \\"all the objects in the scene appear better... than from any other place\\". It is considered the best place and the most coveted one in the audience, which was reserved for the nobility (thus the reference to the prince). Due to the importance of these spectators, of course, many theater shows had their main movements and happenings designed in order to attract the attention of the prince's eye. The usefulness of this point is that it permits the stage designer to calculate the perspective angles of the scenes (decoration) on the stage, as viewed from a central place (the focal point). Beginning in the 17th century, Italian theatrical decoration became very influential in the use of constructions in perspective, which added greater realism to depth perception by the audience. Thus, it satisfied the baroque ideal of opening towards the infinity. Sabbatini and others also invented the scene wings which run on grooves in the floor, allowing a quicker change of decorations during the intermissions. These innovations produced what became known as the sc√®nes √† l‚Äôitalienne in theatres in Italy, France and elsewhere in Europe. In a metaphorical sense, the French language also uses the expression to typify any privileged view of an observer (such as in \\"he had the eye of the prince when he was covering Iraq's war\\"), or also in a way of acting so as to please the privileged observer (such as in \\"he tried to conquer the eye of the prince in his report\\").

Rainham Landfill is operated by Veolia ES Landfill Limited. The site occupies an area of 177 hectares, and accepts up to 1,500,000 tonnes per year. This includes up to 70,000 tonnes per year in a Materials Recovery Facility and 70,000 tonnes per year of Green Waste. There are facilities for soil washing and a Leachate Treatment Plant. The decomposition of organic matter within the landfill generates a gas containing up to about 50 percent methane. This landfill gas is collected by a network of pipes and since 2001 has been used in an onsite power station. The station is owned and operated by EDL. The plant comprises eight 1.25 MW, three 1.4 MW, two 1.1 MW and one 1.0 MW reciprocating engines which drive electricity generating sets. The electricity produced is fed into the National Grid. The station has a generating capacity of 17.8 MW and typically generates 95 GWh of electricity per year. This is equivalent to powering 14,600 homes. The site is expected to produce landfill gas for electricity generation to beyond 2030.

Fossil remains of Cearadactylus dated back to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, about 112 million years ago. The only known species is C. atrox, described and named in 1985 by Giuseppe Leonardi and Guido Borgomanero. The name refers to the Brazilian state Cear√°, and combines this with Greek daktylos, \\"finger\\", a reference to the wing finger of pterosaurs. The Latin atrox means \\"frightful\\", a reference to the fearsome dentition of the species. Discovery The holotype is MN 7019-V (earlier CB-PV-F-O93), from the Romualdo Formation of the Santana Group. This fossil, a single skull with a length of , was discovered on the Araripe plateau in northeastern Brazil.Leonardi, G. & Borgomanero, G. (1985). \\"Cearadactylus atrox nov. gen., nov. sp.: novo Pterosauria (Pterodactyloidea) da Chapada do Araripe, Ceara, Brasil.\\" Resumos dos communica√ßoes VIII Congresso bras. de Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 27: 75‚Äì80. It was traded to Italy in 1983 and bought by Borgomanero for his collection. The skull is severely damaged, especially on the top, and was perhaps reconstructed by the fossil dealer. Model in Germany, showing how the jaws where originally reconstructed As shown by a later preparation by the Brazilian Museu Nacional, in the first preparation many serious mistakes were made. The fronts of the snout and of the lower jaws were confused leading to a reconstruction in which the anterior part of the head was upside down. The teeth were extensively restored and enlarged until the wider front of the jaws showed very large and robust teeth projecting outwards, forming a sort of \\"rosette\\". This kinked upper jaw and its interlocking teeth suggested a piscivourous diet, allowing the animal to keep hold of slippery fish. No crests seemed to be present. The new preparation made clear that a crest was present on the snout and that the rosette was a lot smaller. Many details were discovered that were useful in determining the phylogenetic position of Cearadactylus.Bruno C. Vila Nova, Alexander W.A. Kellner, Juliana M. Say√£o, 2010, \\"Short Note on the Phylogenetic Position of Cearadactylus Atrox, and Comments Regarding Its Relationships to Other Pterosaurs\\", Acta Geoscientica Sinica 31 Supp.1: 73-75 In 1993, Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia named a second species, Cearadactylus ligabuei. The specific name honors Giancarlo Ligabue, the director of the Centro Sudi Ricerche Ligabue in Venice. It is based on holotype CCSRL 12692/12713, again a heavily damaged crestless skull, long. The skull consists of two pieces, the front and the back part, glued together by fossil traders; it is uncertain whether they belong to the same individual or indeed to the same species. Dalla Vecchia was himself not convinced the new species in fact belonged to Cearadactylus, but the skull was not sufficiently unique to base its own genus on yet still too different from known species to be assigned to them, so he created a new species for the genus the fossil most resembled. Later authors have consistently denied the identity referring to the taxon as \\"Cearadactylus\\" ligabuei. Dalla Vecchia estimated the wingspan of \\"C.\\" ligabuei at ; Kellner, pointing out that the skull is not larger than the C. atrox holotype, estimated it at at the most. Dalla Vecchia assigned C. ligabuei to the Cearadactylidae. Kellner concluded it was probably a member of Anhangueridae; Unwin in 2002 even named it Anhanguera ligabuei. In 2005, Steel et al. suggested that it was a Coloborhynchus ligabuei. Description Life restoration The wingspan of Cearadactylus was by the describers estimated to have been around , with a weight of perhaps . Peter Wellnhofer in 1991 estimated a wingspan of 5.5 meters (18 ft). Classification Leonardi did abstain from assigning the genus to a family. Wellnhofer created a special family called Cearadactylidae, but this concept is no longer used. In 2000, Alexander Kellner concluded that it was related to, but lacking a crest not part of, the Anhangueridae within the larger group Pteranodontoidea sensu Kellner. In 2002 however, David Unwin stated it was a highly deviant member of the family Ctenochasmatidae. In 2010, Kellner entered the new information into three existing databases of pterosaur features, to calculate through cladistic analysis the position of Cearadactylus in the phylogenetic tree. Although the three resulting trees differed, all had in common that Cearadactylus was close to the Anhangueridae. In 2012, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. found Cearadactylus within the group Ctenochasmatoidea, part of a polytomy that also comprises Gnathosaurus and Ardeadactylus (identified as Pterodactylus longicolum in the analysis). Subsequent recent analysis however, have found Cearadactylus as a member of the group Anhangueria, and depending on the different analyses, Cearadactylus is either placed in a more derived or basal position.Longrich, N.R., Martill, D.M., and Andres, B. (2018). Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. PLoS Biology, 16(3): e2001663. A phylogenetic analysis by Pentland et al. in 2019 for example, had found Cearadactylus in a derived position within the Anhangueria, just outside the Ornithocheirae, which is the clade that contains the families Ornithocheiridae and Anhangueridae.

Devices capable of participating in this network, for example, smart devices such as network printers and handheld mobile computers, often gain enhanced emergent capabilities through their ability to interact. These additional capabilities can be used to increase the quality of life inside the home in a variety of ways, such as automation of repetitive tasks, increased personal productivity, enhanced home security, and easier access to entertainment. Origins Establishing this kind of network is often necessary for sharing residential Internet access to all networked devices. Based on techniques to mitigate IPv4 address exhaustion, most Internet service providers provide only a single wide area network-facing IP address for each residential customer. Therefore, such networks require network address translation in the network router. DHCP is used in a typical personal home local area network (LAN) to assign IP addresses within the home subnet. The DHCP server is a routerWhat is DHCP?. whatismyip.com. while the clients are hosts (eg. personal computers, smart phones, printers, etc.). The router receives the configuration information through a modem from an internet service provider, which also operates DHCP servers with this router as one of the clients. The clients request configuration settings using the DHCP protocol such as an IP address, a default route and one or more DNS server addresses. Once the client implements these settings, the host is able to communicate on that internet. Infrastructure devices An example of a simple home network A home network usually relies on one or more of the following equipment to establish physical layer, data link layer, and network layer connectivity among internal devices, also known as the LAN, and external devices outside the LAN networks or the WAN. The following are examples of typical LAN devices: * A modem exposes an Ethernet interface to a service provider's native telecommunications infrastructure. In homes these usually come in the form of a DSL modem or cable modem. * A router manages network layer connectivity between a WAN and the HAN. It performs the key function of network address translation enabling multiple devices to share the home's single WAN address. Most home networks feature a particular class of small, passively cooled, table-top device with an integrated wireless access point and 4 port Ethernet switch. These devices aim to make the installation, configuration, and management of a home network as automated, user friendly, and \\"plug-and-play\\" as possible. * A network switch is used to allow devices on the home network to talk to one another via Ethernet. While the needs of most home networks are satisfied with the built- in wireless and/or switching capabilities of their router, some situations require the addition of a separate switch with advanced capabilities. For example: ** A typical home router has 4 to 6 Ethernet LAN ports, so a router's switching capacity could be exceeded. ** A network device might require a non- standard port feature such as power over Ethernet (PoE). (IP cameras and IP phones) * A wireless access point is required for connecting wireless devices to a network. Most home networks rely on a wireless router, which has a built in wireless access point, to fill this role. * A home automation controller enables low-power wireless communications with simple, non-data-intensive devices such as smart light bulbs (Philips Hue) and smart locks (August Home). * A network bridge connects two networks, often in order to grant a wired-only device, e.g. Xbox, access to a wireless network medium. =Triple play= A service provider's triple play solution features a rented modem/wireless router combination device, such as an Arris SURFboard SBG6580, that only requires the setting of a password to complete the installation and configuration. In most situations, there is no longer a need to acquire additional infrastructure devices or even for the user to possess advanced technical knowledge to successfully distribute internet access throughout the home. Physical connectivity and protocols Home networks can use either wired or wireless technologies to connect endpoints. Wireless is the predominant option in homes due to the ease of installation, lack of unsightly cables, and network performance characteristics sufficient for residential activities. = Wireless =  Wireless LAN  One of the most common ways of creating a home network is by using wireless radio signal technology; the 802.11 network as certified by the IEEE. Most wireless-capable residential devices operate at a frequency of 2.4 GHz under 802.11b and 802.11g or 5 GHz under 802.11a. Some home networking devices operate in both radio-band signals and fall within the 802.11n or 802.11ac standards. Wi-Fi is a marketing and compliance certification for IEEE 802.11 technologies.‚ÄúDiscover and Learn,‚Äù WiFi Alliance, http://www.wi-fi.org/discover_and_learn.php (accessed June 30, 2010). The Wi-Fi Alliance has tested compliant products, and certifies them for interoperability.  Wireless PAN  Low power, close range communication based on IEEE 802.15 standards has a strong presence in homes. Bluetooth continues to be the technology of choice for most wireless accessories such as keyboards, mice, headsets, and game controllers. These connections are often established in a transient, ad-hoc manner and are not thought of as permanent residents of a home network.  Low-rate wireless PAN  A \\"low-rate\\" version of the original WPAN protocol was used as the basis of ZigBee. Despite originally being conceived as a standard for low power machine-to-machine communication in industrial environments, the technology has been found to be well suited for integration into embedded \\"Smart Home\\" offerings that are expected to run on battery for extended periods of time. ZigBee utilizes mesh networking to overcome the distance limitations associated with traditional WPAN in order to establish a single network of addressable devices spread across the entire building. Z-Wave is an additional standard also built on 802.15.4, that was developed specifically with the needs of home automation device makers in mind. = Twisted pair cables = Most wired network infrastructures found in homes utilize Category 5 or Category 6 twisted pair cabling with RJ45 compatible terminations. This medium provides physical connectivity between the Ethernet interfaces present on a large number of residential IP-aware devices. Depending on the grade of cable and quality of installation, speeds of up to 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s, or 10Gbit/s are supported. = Fiber optics = Newer upscale neighborhoods can feature fiber optic cables running directly into the homes. This enables service providers to offer internet services with much higher bandwidth and/or lower latency characteristics associated with end-to-end optical signaling. = Telephone wires = * VDSL and VDSL2 * HomePNA support up to 160 Mbit/s = Coaxial cables = The following standards allow devices to communicate over coaxial cables, which are frequently installed to support multiple television sets throughout homes. * DOCSIS * The Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) standard can achieve up to 270 Mbit/s * CWave * HomePNA support up to 320 Mbit/s = Power lines = The ITU-T G.hn and IEEE Powerline standard, which provide high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) local area networking over existing home wiring, are examples of home networking technology designed specifically for IPTV delivery. Recently, the IEEE passed proposal P1901 which grounded a standard within the Market for wireline products produced and sold by companies that are part of the HomePlug Alliance.Faure, Jean-Philippe. ‚ÄúIEEE P1901 Draft Standard for Broadband over Power Line Networks: Medium Access Control and Physical Layer Specifications,‚Äù IEEE Standards Association, http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1901/ (accessed June 22, 2010). The IEEE is continuously working to push for P1901 to be completely recognized worldwide as the sole standard for all future products that are produced for Home Networking. * HomePlug and HomePNA are associated standards * Universal Powerline Association Endpoint devices and services Traditionally, data- centric equipment such as computers and media players have been the primary tenants of a home network. However, due to the lowering cost of computing and the ubiquity of smartphone usage, many traditionally non-networked home equipment categories now include new variants capable of control or remote monitoring through an app on a smartphone. Newer startups and established home equipment manufacturers alike have begun to offer these products as part of a \\"Smart\\" or \\"Intelligent\\" or \\"Connected Home\\" portfolio. The control and/or monitoring interfaces for these products can be accessed through proprietary smartphone applications specific to that product line. =General purpose= * Personal computers such as desktops, laptops, netbooks, and tablets * A network attached storage (NAS) device can be easily accessed via the CIFS or NFS protocols for general storage or for backup purposes. * A print server can be used to share any directly connected printers with other computers on the network. * IP phones or smartphones (when connected via Wi-Fi) utilizing VoIP technologies =Entertainment= * Smart speakers * Television: Some new TVs and DVRs include integrated WiFi connectivity which allows the user to access services such as Netflix and YouTube * Home audio: Digital audio players, and stereo systems with network connectivity can allow a user to easily access their music library, often using Bonjour to discover and interface with an instance of iTunes running on a remote PC. * Gaming: video game consoles rely on connectivity to the home network to enable a significant portion of their overall features, such as the multiplayer in games, social network integration, ability to purchase or demo new games, and receive software updates. Recent consoles have begun more aggressively pursuing the role of the sole entertainment and media hub of the home. * DLNA is a common protocol used for interoperability between networked media-centric devices in the home Some older entertainment devices may not feature the appropriate network interfaces required for home network connectivity. In some situations, USB dongles and PCI Network Interface Cards are available as accessories that enable this functionality. =Lighting= * \\"Connected\\" light bulbs such as Lifx, Philips Hue, Samsung Smart Bulb, GE Link * ZigBee Light Link is the open standards protocol used by current major \\"Connected\\" light bulb vendors =Home security and access control= * Security alarms: iSmartAlarm * Garage door and gate openers: Liftmaster MyQ, GoGogate =Environmental monitoring and conditioning= * HVAC: Nest Learning Thermostat * Smoke/CO detectors: Nest Protect =Cloud services= The convenience, availability, and reliability of externally managed cloud computing resources continues to become an appealing choice for many home-dwellers without interest or experience in IT. For these individuals, the subscription fees and/or privacy risks associated with such services are often perceived as lower cost than having to configure and maintain similar facilities within a home network. In such situations, local services along with the devices maintaining them are replaced by those in an external data center and made accessible to the home-dweller's computing devices via a WAN connection. Network management =Embedded devices= Small standalone embedded home network devices typically require remote configuration from a PC on the same network. For example, broadband modems are often configured through a web browser running on a PC in the same network. These devices usually use a minimal Linux distribution with a lightweight HTTP server running in the background to allow the user to conveniently modify system variables from a GUI rendered in their browser. These pages use HTML forms extensively and make attempts to offer styled, visually appealing views that are also descriptive and easy to use. =Apple ecosystem devices= Apple devices aim to make networking as hidden and automatic as possible, utilizing a zero-configuration networking protocol called Bonjour embedded within their otherwise proprietary line of software and hardware products. =Microsoft ecosystem devices= Microsoft offers simple access control features built into their Windows operating system. Homegroup is a feature that allows shared disk access, shared printer access and shared scanner access among all computers and users (typically family members) in a home, in a similar fashion as in a small office workgroup, e.g., by means of distributed peer-to-peer networking (without a central server). Additionally, a home server may be added for increased functionality. The Windows HomeGroup feature was introduced with Microsoft Windows 7 in order to simplify file sharing in residences. All users (typically all family members), except guest accounts, may access any shared library on any computer that is connected to the home group. Passwords are not required from the family members during logon. Instead, secure file sharing is possible by means of a temporary password that is used when adding a computer to the HomeGroup.Greg Holden, Lawrence C. Miller, Home Networking Do-It-Yourself for Dummies, John Wiley and Sons, 2011. Common issues and concerns =Wireless signal loss= The wireless signal strength of the standard residential wireless router may not be powerful enough to cover the entire house or may not be able to get through to all floors of multiple floor residences. In such situations, the installation of one or more wireless repeaters may be necessary. =\\"Leaky\\" Wi-Fi= Wi-Fi often extends beyond the boundaries of a home and can create coverage where it is least wanted, offering a channel through which non-residents could compromise a system and retrieve personal data. To prevent this it is usually sufficient to enforce the use of authentication, encryption, or VPN that requires a password for network connectivity.Wangerien, Brian. \\"The Challenges of Wi-Fi.\\" Communications News. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Web http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/21597846/The-challenges-of- WiFi. However new Wi-Fi standards working at 60 GHz, such as 802.11ad, enable confidence that the LAN will not trespass physical barriers, as at such frequencies a simple wall would attenuate the signal considerably. =Electrical grid noise= For home networks relying on powerline communication technology, how to deal with electrical noise injected into the system from standard household appliances remains the largest challenge. Whenever any appliance is turned on or turned off it creates noise that could possibly disrupt data transfer through the wiring. IEEE products that are certified to be HomePlug 1.0 compliant have been engineered to no longer interfere with, or receive interference from other devices plugged into the same home's electrical grid.‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions,‚Äù HomePlug Powerline Alliance, http://www.homeplug.org/about/faqs/ (accessed June 22, 2010). =Administration= The administration of proliferating devices and software in home networks, and the growing amount of private data, is fast becoming an issue by itself. Keeping overview, applying without delay SW updates and security patches, keeping juniors internet use within safe boundaries, structuring of storage and access levels for private files and other data, Data backups, detection and cleaning of any infections, operating virtual private networks for easy access to resources in the home network when away, etc.. Such things are all issues that require attention and planned careful work in order to provide a secure, resilient, and stable home network easy to use for all members of the household and their guests.

It was released in 1965, and unlike the other films in the series was produced in the United Kingdom. The film was directed by Don Sharp and the screenplay was written by Harry Spalding.CURSE OF THE FLY, the. (1966, Monthly Film Bulletin, 33, 42. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1305825739 Curse of the Fly was rarely seen for many years, as it was the only entry in the entire Fly film trilogy that did not receive a videotape, laserdisc or online release. It did not receive its home video premiere until 2007, when it was released in a boxed set with the original series of films. Plot Martin Delambre (Baker) is driving to Montreal one night when he sees a young girl by the name of Patricia Stanley (Gray) running in her underwear. They fall in love and are soon married. However, they both hold secrets: she has recently escaped from a mental asylum; he and his father Henri (Donlevy) are engaged in radical experiments in teleportation, which have already had horrific consequences. Martin also suffers recessive fly genes which cause him to age rapidly and he needs a serum to keep him young. In a rambling mansion in rural Quebec, Martin and Henri have successfully teleported people between there and London. However, previous failures resulted in horribly disfigured and insane victims who are locked in the stables. Martin's first wife is one of them, as are Samuels and Dale, two men who had worked as the Delambres' assistants. Martin's brother Albert (Graham) mans the London receiving station but wishes to terminate the teleportation project and escape the obsession that has driven his grandfather, his father and his brother. The police and the headmistress of the asylum trace Patricia to the Delambre estate, where they learn that she has married Martin, but it is soon discovered that he had a previous wife whom he did not divorce. Inspector Charas, who had investigated Andre Delambre and is now an old man in the hospital, tells Inspector Ronet about the Delambre family and their experiments. As the police begin to close in, a mixture of callousness and madness afflicts the Delambres, and they decide to abandon their work and eliminate the evidence of their failures. They subdue and teleport Samuels and Dale, but upon reintegration in London the two men are fused into a single writhing mass. Albert is horrified at the sight and kills the thing with an axe, destroying the teleportation equipment in the process. Tai and Wan (Burt Kwouk and Yvette Rees), a Chinese couple who had been helping the Delambres, have had enough and leave the Quebec estate. Henri convinces Martin that they must send the unconscious Patricia to London and then follow in order to escape from the police. Martin resists, afraid that she might be harmed, so Henri volunteers to go first. Martin sends Henri to London, unaware that Albert has destroyed the reintegration equipment. Henri does not rematerialize and is lost. Realizing what has happened, Albert leaves the lab, sobbing, and is not seen again. Inspector Ronet arrives at the estate, passing Tai and Wan as they drive away. Patricia awakens in the teleportation chamber but escapes before the transmission sequence is complete. Martin pursues her but starts aging again. Without his serum he quickly dies, sprawled across the front seat of his car. Soon after, Ronet finds him reduced to a skeleton, and he escorts the badly shaken Patricia back into the house.

Lippert was making in England, in order to take advantage of the Eady Levy. He used an English producer, Jack Parsons. Parsons had previously made Witchcraft (1964) with director Don Sharp for Lippert and used them again on Curse of the Fly. Lippert wanted to make a third \\"Fly\\" movie. Harry Spalding says he was reluctant to do it but Lippert said \\"you handle it, kid.\\" Although a sequel to The Fly and Return of the Fly, the backstory used for Curse of the Fly does not match the continuity of the first two films. However, it does build its narrative on elements and characters from those films. Curse of the Fly centers on Henri and Martin Delambre, identified as the son and grandson of the Andre Delambre character depicted in The Fly. Andre's invention of a teleportation device and subsequent accidental integration with a housefly remain within the backstory. However, his resultant assisted suicide is removed. Instead, his son, apparently a different character from the boy Philippe Delambre depicted in The Fly, was able to put both the altered man and the altered fly back into the teleportation chamber and successfully reverse the integration, as was done with an adult Philippe in Return of the Fly. The dialogue within Curse of the Fly contains no mention of Philippe, although a photograph shown in the film, which is supposed to be of Andre in his altered form from The Fly, is actually a production still from Philippe's transformation in Return of the Fly. \\"It wasn't all that bad a script,\\" said Spalding later. \\"As a matter of fact, Don Sharp said the opening ten pages, where the girl is coming out of the insane asylum, was the best opening he'd ever had on film.\\" Harry Spalding said he wrote the lead for \\"a Claude Rains kind of guy\\" and was unhappy to get Brian Donlevy. Spalding said he thought this affected Don Sharp's confidence in the film.

Its southern terminus is at Battery Place near the northern end of the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel in New York City, where it intersects with both the unsigned Interstate 478 (I-478) and FDR Drive. The northern terminus of NY 9A is at U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Peekskill. It is predominantly an alternate route of US 9 between New York City and Peekskill; however, in New York City, it is a major route of its own as it runs along the West Side Highway and Henry Hudson Parkway. It is also one of only two signed New York State routes in Manhattan (the other is NY 25). In northern Westchester County, NY 9A follows the Briarcliff‚ÄìPeekskill Parkway. The origins of NY 9A date back to the 1920s when an alternate route of then-NY 6 from Yonkers to Tarrytown was designated as NY 6A. NY 6 was redesignated as US 9 in 1927; however, NY 6A was not renumbered to NY 9A until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 9A was extended south into New York City in 1934 and north to Ossining in the late 1930s. In 1933, the Briarcliff‚ÄìPeekskill Parkway opened as NY 404. All of NY 404 was incorporated into an extended NY 9A on January 1, 1949. NY 9A was extended northward to Peekskill in 1967 following the completion of the Croton Expressway and southward to the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel in the mid-1990s. Route description NY 9A northbound at 52nd Street in Manhattan NY 9A begins in Lower Manhattan at Battery Place near the north end of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (unsigned I-478) and heads north on the surface West Side Highway and Henry Hudson Parkway, crossing US 9 for the first time at the east end of the George Washington Bridge. After crossing into the Bronx via the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority-owned Henry Hudson Bridge, NY 9A proceeds to leave the parkway at exit 23, joining US 9 on Broadway. The portions of NY 9A between Lower Manhattan and 72nd Street, and from 125th Street to the New York City line (with the exception of the Henry Hudson Bridge) are owned by the New York State Department of Transportation, the portion between 72nd and 125th Streets is owned by the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation and the entire highway within city limits is maintained on a daily basis by the New York City Department of Transportation. The concurrency between US 9 and NY 9A runs for within the city of Yonkers. All of NY 9A within Yonkers is maintained by the city. NY 9A and NY 100 southbound in Briarcliff Manor NY 9A separates from US 9 along Ashburton Avenue and heads north as Saw Mill River Road. It parallels the Saw Mill River Parkway through Ardsley and Elmsford, to the west side of Hawthorne. The route meets the southbound New York State Thruway (I-87) at a partial interchange and later meets I-287 (the Cross-Westchester Expressway) at a full interchange that provides a route to the northbound Thruway (I-87). NY 100 merges with NY 9A to form a concurrency carrying the names Saw Mill River Road and Briarcliff‚ÄìPeekskill Parkway, parallel to the Taconic State Parkway. NY 9A exits off this highway along the Briarcliff‚ÄìPeekskill Parkway, while NY 100 continues straight as Saw Mill River Road. NY 9A merges to form a brief concurrency with US 9 as the Croton Expressway in Ossining just south of the Croton River. The second concurrency between US 9 and NY 9A runs for 1.10 miles, with NY 9A leaving the Croton Expressway at NY 129 in Croton-on-Hudson. The highway heads north along Riverside Avenue and eventually joins old Albany Post Road. After crossing US 9 once more in Cortlandt, NY 9A ends at the Welcher Avenue interchange in southern Peekskill. History =Origins= Prior to the establishment of the U.S. Highway System, US 9 was designated as NY 6. An alternate route from Yonkers to Tarrytown was assigned the NY 6A designation by 1926. This ran along the present alignment of NY 9A from Yonkers to north of Elmsford, where it turned west on Old Saw Mill River Road, Neperan Road, County House Road and Bedford Road to end at NY 6 in Tarrytown. NY 6 was redesignated as US 9 when U.S. Highways were first posted in New York in 1927; however, NY 6A was not renumbered at this time. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. It was finally renumbered to NY 9A as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering Tarrytown, including US 9 and NY 9A, in 1938. New York City initially did not mark numbered routes within its limits. In 1932, the New York Automobile Club drafted a plan establishing alignments for several routes through the city. In this plan, NY 9A went south through the Bronx and into Manhattan on Broadway while US 9 used Riverdale Avenue north of 230th Street. As a result, the two routes would have had a short concurrency across Spuyten Duyvil Creek. NY 9A would have split to the south on Tenth Avenue at 218th Street in order to join the Harlem River Drive via Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street. From there it would head west on 155th Street to Amsterdam Avenue, where it would head south to 79th Street, heading west there to rejoin US 9 at Riverside Drive. US 9 would have continued south through lower Manhattan to Staten Island via the Staten Island Ferry; however, it is unclear whether NY 9A would have continued south with US 9 to lower Manhattan. The New York Automobile Club released another plan in 1933. This plan made no changes to NY 9A; however, US 9 was changed to use Broadway all the way through the Bronx and to travel to New Jersey by way of the Holland Tunnel. In the final plan implemented in mid-December 1934, no route was assigned to the Harlem River Drive‚ÄìAmsterdam Avenue corridor. Instead, NY 9A used what had been planned as US 9, splitting at Broadway and Dyckman Street. NY 9A ran south along the west side of Manhattan on Riverside Drive and the West Side Elevated Highway (detouring around an unfinished section via 57th Street, Eleventh Avenue and 48th Street) to end at the entrance and exit plazas of the Holland Tunnel. US 9 was shifted northward to enter New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge. =Westchester County= In Westchester County, Saw Mill River Road originally followed the Saw Mill River Parkway corridor from Eastview to Hawthorne. This section of Saw Mill River Road gained a number , becoming part of NY 142, a route that began at NY 100 on the Greenburgh‚ÄìMount Pleasant town line and followed Grasslands Road, NY 9A, and Saw Mill River Road north to Hawthorne, where it rejoined NY 100. The route went unchanged until it was removed . Its former routing was split into two routes‚Äîan extended NY 141 north of NY 9A and the new NY 100C along Grasslands Road‚Äîby 1940. NY 9A was extended northward from Tarrytown to Archville, a small hamlet midway between Tarrytown and Ossining, by way of Sleepy Hollow Road. Farther north, a new highway was built around Ossining from Saw Mill River Road (NY 100) in Briarcliff Manor to US 9 north of Ossining. The highway, known as the Briarcliff‚ÄìPeekskill Parkway, was completed and initially designated as NY 404. On January 1, 1949, NY 9A was altered to continue north along a slightly realigned Saw Mill River Road from NY 100C near Elmsford to the south end of the Briarcliff‚ÄìPeekskill Parkway in Briarcliff Manor. At this point, NY 9A left Saw Mill River Road and followed the parkway to its end at US 9, supplanting NY 404. The realignment created a overlap between NY 9A and NY 100 from Hawthorne to Briarcliff Manor and resulted in the truncation of NY 141 back to its previous terminus in Hawthorne. 1974 photo of the collapsed section of the West Side Elevated Highway at 14th Street Construction on the Croton Expressway, the only piece of the failed Hudson River Expressway project that was ever built, began in the mid-1960s. It became part of a realigned US 9 when it was completed by 1967. The former surface routing of US 9 along Albany Post Road between Croton-on-Hudson and Buchanan became a northward extension of NY 9A, which reached the old alignment by way of an overlap with US 9 from the north end of the Briarcliff‚ÄìPeekskill Parkway to Croton-on-Hudson. =New York City= NY 9A end sign approaching its southern terminus at Battery Place in Battery Park City As the Henry Hudson Parkway replaced Riverside Drive in the mid-1930s, NY 9A was moved onto it, eventually using the new parkway to where it crossed US 9 (Broadway) in the Bronx. Here, NY 9A exited the parkway and ran concurrent with US 9 to the split in Yonkers. The Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel connecting Manhattan's Battery Park to Brooklyn was completed in 1950. By 1960, an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway south to the Manhattan tunnel portal became part of NY 27A, which had ended in Brooklyn prior to the construction of the tunnel. On January 1, 1970, NY 27A was truncated on its western end to eastern Nassau County while NY 27 was extended northward over NY 27A's former routing through the Battery Tunnel and the West Side Elevated Highway. However, by 1973, NY 27 had been cut back to its interchange with the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn while unsigned I-478 was assigned to both the Battery Tunnel and all of the West Side Elevated Highway south of the Lincoln Tunnel. NY 9A was cut back to the Lincoln Tunnel as a result. The extension of I-478 into Manhattan was eliminated following the collapse of part of the Elevated Highway in 1973, an event which led to the demolition of the highway south of 59th Street. Demolition was completed in 1989. NY 9A was shifted onto 12th Avenue, one of the surface streets that the Elevated Highway had run atop of, but was otherwise unaffected as the route's south end was initially kept at the Lincoln Tunnel. In the mid-1990s, NY 9A was extended south to the Battery Tunnel by way of 12th Avenue and two other streets the Elevated Highway had previously run atop of, West Street and 11th Avenue. Construction began in early 1996 on a project to convert the section of NY 9A south of 59th Street into the West Side Highway, a six-lane urban boulevard with a parkway- style median and decorative lightposts. The first of the project's seven segments‚Äîbetween Clarkson and Horatio streets in the Greenwich Village neighborhood‚Äîwas completed in 1998. Completion of the project was originally set for October 2001; however, it was delayed for years due to damage caused by the September 11 attacks. It was finished by 2014.

It stars Christopher Lee, Herbert Lom and Klaus Kinski. Although Count Dracula stars Lee in the title role, it is not a Hammer production like his other Dracula films, being produced instead by Harry Alan Towers. Klaus Kinski, who would play Dracula himself nine years later in Nosferatu the Vampyre, is also featured in the film as Renfield. Count Dracula was advertised as the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. Among other details, it was the first film version of the novel in which Dracula begins as an old man and becomes younger as he feeds upon fresh blood. The film was shot at the Tirrenia Studios and on location in Spain. The film's sets were designed by the art director Karl Schneider.  Plot  Jonathan Harker, a lawyer traveling from London to Transylvania to secure property for Count Dracula, arrives at Bistritz to stay for the night. There, he is warned by a concerned lady against continuing his journey the following day. Harker believes that her concerns are rooted in peasant superstition. He ignores her, but starts to feel increasingly unnerved by the way everyone looks at him. Harker sets off for the rest of his journey and arrives at the Borgo Pass where he's picked up by the Count's mysterious coachman. Harker disembarks at Castle Dracula, and the coach immediately rushes off. Somewhat hesitantly, Harker approaches the main door, whereupon a thin, tall, gaunt old man opens it. Harker asks, \\"Count Dracula?\\" \\"I am Dracula, enter freely and of your own will,\\" says the man at the door. Dracula takes Harker to his bedchamber where Harker notices that Dracula casts no reflection. Later, Harker goes to sleep. He wakes in an ancient crypt where he is harassed by three beautiful vampiresses. Dracula rushes into the room in a rage and orders them to leave Harker alone. Dracula explains, \\"This man belongs to me,\\" then gives the vampiresses a baby to feed on. Harker wakes up screaming in his room and assumes it was a nightmare, but two small wounds on his neck indicate otherwise. Harker soon realises he is a prisoner, and tries to escape by climbing out of his bedroom window. He finds his way back to the crypt where Count Dracula and his three brides rest in coffins. Harker runs out of the crypt screaming, and jumps out of the castle's tower into the river below. Harker wakes up in a private psychiatric clinic outside London, owned by Dr. Van Helsing, in the care of Dr. Seward. He is told he was found delirious in a river near Budapest. Naturally, no one believes his story about Castle Dracula until Van Helsing finds the two punctures on Harker's neck. Harker's fianc√©e Mina and her close friend Lucy also arrive at the hospital to help take care of him. Unbeknownst to them, Count Dracula has followed Harker back to England and now resides in an abandoned abbey close to the hospital. As Mina nurses Harker back to health, her friend Lucy's health strangely declines. Dracula has been secretly appearing to her by night and drinking her blood, growing younger as he feeds off his victim. Quincey Morris, Lucy's fianc√©, joins Drs. Seward and Van Helsing in an attempt to save Lucy by giving her a blood transfusion from Quincey. One of the patients at the clinic, R. M. Renfield, becomes of considerable interest to the men. Renfield is classed as a zoophagus: he eats flies and insects in order to consume their life, believing that each life he consumes increases his own. He reacts violently whenever Dracula is nearby. Lucy eventually dies while her men helplessly look on. As Van Helsing suspected, Lucy has become one of the undead and murders a young child, but the ordeal is put to an end when Quincey, Seward and Van Helsing ambush Lucy in her tomb, stake her through the heart and decapitate her. Harker, restored to health, joins the group who now are sure that Count Dracula is a vampire. Dracula turns his attention to Mina and begins corrupting her as well. Van Helsing suddenly has a stroke and remains in a wheelchair. Dracula visits the weakened man, mocking his attempts to destroy him. Quincey, Harker and Seward track Dracula to the abandoned abbey, but he has fled to Transylvania with the aid of a traveling Gypsy band. Meanwhile, at the clinic, Renfield suffers a shock and dies peacefully. As Count Dracula's Gypsy servants take him back to his castle, he is trailed by Harker and Quincey. After battling the Gypsies, the two heroes find Dracula's coffin and set it on fire. Dracula, unable to escape in full daylight, is consumed by flames.

Even Christopher Lee (in an uncharacteristically weak performance as Dracula), Klaus Kinski (as the mad Renfield), and seven credited screenwriters cannot make this confused, distant film worthwhile. Franco appears as a servant to Professor Van Helsing (Herbert Lom), and though certainly literate, the film nevertheless fails as both horror and drama. New York Times Review Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"For curious Dracula fans, Jess Franco's Count Dracula is a neat find. It's a stellar cast working under a low budget, and it comes off entertaining if not a classic. It's a B-movie treatment at best, but ... Lee comes off fiery and committed to making this Count one that will be noticed.\\"DVD Verdict Review - Jess Franco's Count Dracula Brian Lindsey of Eccentric Cinema wrote, \\"Upon weighing [the film's] pros and cons, Count Dracula emerges a substantially flawed film. But I can still recommend it to any fan of Lee, Franco, Miranda, and even of Stoker's novel.\\"Eccentric Cinema  COUNT DRACULA (1970) George R. Reis of DVD Drive-In wrote, \\"Count Dracula is flawed in many ways, but for fans of gothic horror, it's still irresistible ... Barcelona naturally allows for some truly handsome scenery and an appropriate castle for Dracula to dwell in, and the performances of the international cast are above average.\\"Count Dracula (El Conde Dracula) 1970 - DVD Drive-In Dracula scholar Leslie S. Klinger said \\"the picture begins well, closely following the Stoker narrative account of Harker's encounter with Dracula. The film rapidly proceeds into banality, however, and except for the characterization of Lee as an older Dracula and the brilliant Kinski, the film is largely forgettable.\\"Klinger, Leslie S. The New Annotated Dracula. W.W. Norton & Co., 2008. , page 561 Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum called it \\"one of the world's worst horror films\\" in his review of Pere Portabella's film Cuadecuc, Vampir, which was shot during the making of this film.  DVD release  Count Dracula was released on DVD in 2007 by Dark Sky Films. Special features include an interview with director Jes√∫s Franco, a reading from Bram Stoker's Dracula novel by Christopher Lee, and a text essay on the life of actress Soledad Miranda. The DVD has come under criticism for omitting the scene in which a distraught mother pleads for her baby's life at the door of Dracula's castle. The DVD also uses the Italian credits for the film but with the French title card Les Nuits de Dracula.

Its headquarters are in Colwyn Bay. History North Wales Police Headquarters in Colwyn Bay Gwynedd Constabulary was formed in 1950 by the amalgamation of the Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merionethshire Constabularies. In 1965, the force had an establishment of 308 and an actual strength of 296.The Thin Blue Line, Police Council for Great Britain Staff Side Claim for Undermanning Supplements, 1965 Flintshire Constabulary and Denbighshire Constabulary were merged into the force in 1967, but it retained its existing name. On 1 April 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 created an administrative county of Gwynedd covering part of the police area (equivalent to the original Gwynedd Constabulary area). To avoid confusion, the force was renamed North Wales Police. Under proposals made by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, the force would merge with Dyfed-Powys Police, Gwent Police and South Wales Police to form a single strategic force for all of Wales. The proposals were later shelved. On 4 May 2011, North Wales Police completed a major restructuring, moving from 3 territorial divisions to a single North Wales-wide Policing function. =Governance= The force was previously overseen by a police authority, consisting of 17 members (9 councillors, 3 magistrates and 5 independent members). The councillors were appointed by a Joint Committee from Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd and Wrexham councils. The Police Authority was replaced by the North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner in November 2012. Collaborations North Wales Police is a partner in the following collaboration: * North West Police Underwater Search & Marine Unit * North Wales and Cheshire Firearms Alliance * Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit Controversy In the 2000s, North Wales Police has attracted a great deal of media attention, largely attributed to its former Chief Constable, Richard Brunstrom. Brunstrom was a controversial figure, mainly because of his vocal views on speeding motorists and the legalisation of drugs. The Sun newspaper dubbed him the \\"Mad Mullah of the Traffic Taleban.\\" However, he also earned respect for modernising the force's infrastructure, and learning the Welsh language, actively promoting the normalisation of its use within the force at all levels and conversing publicly through it on numerous occasions. In April 2007, Brunstrom came under fire for an incident in which he showed a photograph of the severed head of a biker in a press meeting without the family's permission, to make a point about road safety. The photo enabled the media to identify the deceased, since he was wearing a distinctive T-shirt with an anti-police message on it, which gained a lot of attention during the inquest. Brunstrom maintained (in both the invitation and verbally) that it was a \\"closed\\" meeting, and that no details of the picture should have been leaked. Motorcycle News magazine handed in a 1,600 signature petition to the Independent Police Complaints Commission requesting Brunstrom be removed. The IPCC confirmed that it would carry out an independent review into the incident. North Wales Police has also attracted attention due to its investigation into allegations of anti-Welsh comments by TV personality Anne Robinson and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. The force was believed to have carried out these investigations following complaints from members of the public. The 10-month investigation into the Prime Minister was dropped on 11 July 2006 due to a lack of evidence. It had cost ¬£1,656, whereas the Anne Robinson investigation cost ¬£3,800.

At times, it has been considered dubious or a valid genus of basal iguanodontian, perhaps a dryosaurid. History and description Life restoration Callovosaurus is based on BMNH R1993, a nearly complete left thigh bone. This specimen was collected from the middle Callovian‚Äìage (Middle Jurassic) Peterborough Member (former Lower Oxford Clay) of the Oxford Clay Formation of Fletton, near Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, England. The bone is long, and is estimated to have belonged to an animal approximately in length. A partial shin bone from the same site or nearby, SMC J.46889, may also belong to Callovosaurus. The type species, C. leedsi, was first described by Richard Lydekker in 1889 as Camptosaurus leedsi, the specific name honouring collector Alfred Nicholson Leeds. Aside from Charles W. Gilmore suggesting in 1909 that it was probably more closely related to Dryosaurus than to Camptosaurus, Camptosaurus leedsi attracted little attention for decades until it was reviewed by Peter Galton. First noting its distinctiveness in a review of English hypsilophodontids, he then gave the species the new genus Callovosaurus in 1980, which he placed in Camptosauridae. While considered a dubious iguanodontian in several reviews, which refer to it as \\"Camptosaurus\\" leedsi, Jose Ignacio Ruiz-Ome√±aca and coauthors have proposed that Callovosaurus is a valid genus, and the oldest known dryosaurid. Palaeoecology Callovosaurus was found in the lower Oxford Clay, which has yielded a diverse reptile assemblage: ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, crocodyliforms, pterosaurs, sauropod dinosaurs, the stegosaurids Loricatosaurus and the dubious Lexovisaurus, and the armoured dinosaur Sarcolestes. These rocks were once thought to be somewhat younger, from the Oxfordian of the Late Jurassic, but they are now known to be middle Callovian in age. The diet of Callovosaurus, like that of other iguanodontians, was plant material. It is one of the earliest known members of the iguanodontian lineage.

Welles adapted Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning 1918 novel, about the declining fortunes of a wealthy Midwestern family and the social changes brought by the automobile age. The film stars Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt, Agnes Moorehead and Ray Collins, with Welles providing the narration. Welles lost control of the editing of The Magnificent Ambersons to RKO, and the final version released to audiences differed significantly from his rough cut of the film. More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer Bernard Herrmann insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio. Even in the released version, The Magnificent Ambersons is often regarded as among the greatest films of all time, a distinction it shares with Welles's first film, Citizen Kane. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and it was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1991. Plot The Magnificent Ambersons trailer The Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in their midwestern city, in the last few decades of the 19th century. As a young man Eugene Morgan courts Isabel Amberson. She rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her, instead marrying Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love, and spoils their child George. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'. At the beginning of the 20th century, Major Amberson gives a large party at the Amberson Mansion for George, who is home from college for the holidays. Eugene, now a widower who has just returned to town after twenty years, attends. George dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber, and ridicules Eugene's investment in the automobile. He instantly takes to Eugene's daughter Lucy. The next day, George and Lucy take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack. Eugene's \\"horseless carriage\\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \\"get a horse\\". The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back home. George is humiliated by the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene. Time passes. Eugene becomes very wealthy manufacturing automobiles, and again courts Isabel, who refuses to risk George's disapproval by telling him about their love. Lucy rejects George's marriage proposal, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are, and leaves town. The Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner, where George, blaming him for turning Lucy against him, criticizes automobiles. The Ambersons are shocked by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from Aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. Enraged, he rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George. Lucy returns home to find that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints. Months pass. Isabel is seriously ill, but George will not allow her to come home lest she renew her relationship with Eugene, relenting only when she starts to die. George refuses to let Eugene into the house to visit Isabel on her deathbed, despite her begging to see Eugene one last time. After Isabel's death, Major Amberson sinks into senility and dies. His estate is worthless. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George intends to live on Fanny's income whilst training to be a lawyer, but she reveals that she lost everything in bad investments, leaving them only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year. Eugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an American Indian chief who was \\"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\\" when he became too obnoxious, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George. Penniless, George gives up his job as a law clerk, and finds higher paying work in a chemical factory, giving him enough money for himself and Fanny to live on. George wanders the city, dazed by the modern factories and slums which have grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson Mansion before it is sold, George prays by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see him receive his comeuppance. George is seriously injured by an automobile. Lucy and Eugene go to see him at the hospital and reconcile with him. In a hospital corridor, Eugene tells Fanny that Isabel's spirit had inspired Eugene to bring George \\"under shelter again\\"implying that his and Fanny's financial security was assured. Cast Production =Adaptation history= Welles first adapted The Magnificent Ambersons for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his Mercury Players on The Campbell Playhouse, with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration. While Welles supplied narration to the film adaptation, Ray Collins was the only actor from the radio production to appear in the film. =Production history= Orson Welles directing The Magnificent Ambersons The Magnificent Ambersons was in production October 28, 1941 ‚Äì January 22, 1942, at RKO's Gower Street studios in Los Angeles. The set for the Amberson mansion was constructed like a real house, but it had walls that could be rolled back, raised, or lowered to allow the camera to appear to pass through them in a continuous take. RKO later used many of the film's sets for its low-budget films, including a series of horror films produced by Val Lewton. Location shooting took place at various places around the Los Angeles area, including Big Bear Lake, the San Bernardino National Forest, and East Los Angeles. Snow scenes were shot in the Union Ice Company ice house in downtown L.A.IMDB Filming Locations for The Magnificent Ambersons The film was budgeted at $853,950 but this went over during the shoot and ultimately exceeded $1 million. In a 1973 interview with Dick Cavett, Moorehead recalled the arduous work involved before filming her climactic scene where she sinks against the unheated boiler. In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \\"play it like a little girl,\\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \\"like an insane woman.\\" Following that, Welles told her to play it \\"like she's absolutely inebriated.\\" Then he said to play with \\"an absolutely vacuous mind.\\" Moorehead was thinking to herself, \\"What in the world does he want?\\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead: \\"Now play it.\\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \\"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...[H]e had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\\" Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities: \\"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\\" The original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in Pomona, film editor Robert Wise removed several minutes from it. The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve. Because Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director Fred Fleck, Robert Wise, and Jack Moss, the business manager of Welles's Mercury Theatre. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel. Welles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on It's All True for RKO‚ÄîNelson Rockefeller had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime Good Neighbor Policy‚Äîhis attempts to protect his version ultimately failed. Details of Welles's conflict over the editing are included in the 1993 documentary about It's All True. \\"Of course I expected that there would be an uproar about a picture which, by any ordinary American standards, was much darker than anybody was making pictures,\\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \\"There was just a built-in dread of the downbeat movie, and I knew I'd have that to face, but I thought I had a movie so good‚ÄîI was absolutely certain of its value, much more than of Kane ... It's a tremendous preparation for the boardinghouse ... and the terrible walk of George Minafer when he gets his comeuppance. And without that, there wasn't any plot. It's all about some rich people fighting in their house.\\" Welles said he would not have gone to South America without the studio's guarantee that he could finish editing The Magnificent Ambersons there. \\"And they absolutely betrayed me and never gave me a shot at it. You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on Mr. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\\" The negatives for the excised portions of The Magnificent Ambersons were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be lost, along with the prints from the previews. A documentary team led by Joshua Grossberg plans a search for the print in late 2020. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version. The film features what could be considered an inside joke: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the Indianapolis Daily Inquirer, part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane. Also appearing on the front page is the column \\"Stage News\\", by the fictional writer Jed Leland, with a photo of Joseph Cotten, who portrayed Leland in the earlier film. =Budget= The budget for The Magnificent Ambersons was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of Citizen Kane. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924. =Score= Like the film itself, Bernard Herrmann's score for The Magnificent Ambersons was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.Husted, Christopher, liner notes for The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score, Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990 =Spoken credits= \\"I wrote the script and directed it. My name is Orson Welles. This is a Mercury Production.\\" The Magnificent Ambersons is one of the earliest films in movie history in which nearly all the credits are spoken by an off-screen voice and not shown printed onscreen‚Äîa technique used before only by the French director and player Sacha Guitry. The only credits shown onscreen are the RKO logo, \\"A Mercury Production by Orson Welles\\", and the film's title, shown at the beginning of the picture. At the end of the film, Welles's voice announces all the main credits. Each actor in the film is shown as Welles announces his or her name. As he speaks each technical credit, a machine is shown performing that function. Welles reads his own credit ‚Äî \\"My name is Orson Welles\\" ‚Äî over top of an image of a microphone which then recedes into the distance.The footage of the microphone is taken from the trailer for Citizen Kane in which Welles similarly narrated the key acting credits for the film. \\"I got a lot of hell because of that,\\" Welles later said of his verbal sign-off. \\"People think it's egotistic. The truth is, I was just speaking to a public who knew me from the radio in a way they were used to hearing on our shows. In those days we had an enormous public ‚Äî in the millions ‚Äî who heard us every week, so it didn't seem pompous to end a movie in our radio style.\\" =Welles's 1970s revisit= In conversations (1969‚Äì1975) with Peter Bogdanovich compiled in This Is Orson Welles, Welles confirmed that he had planned to reshoot the ending of The Magnificent Ambersons with the principal cast members who were still living: > Yes, I had an outside chance to finish it again just a couple of years ago, > but I couldn't swing it. The fellow who was going to buy the film for me > disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive > now‚ÄîCotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt‚Äîand do quite a new end to the movie, > twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a > large audience to see it for the first time. You see, the basic intention > was to portray a golden world‚Äîalmost one of memory‚Äîand then show what it > turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \\"good old days,\\" the whole > point was to show the automobile wrecking it‚Äînot only the family but the > town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's > a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, > quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. > My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went > on. And it was hysterical. Everybody they could find was cutting it. Reception =Box office= The film managed to earn $1 million in rentals in the U.S. and Canada, according to Variety. However it was not enough to recoup the film's cost and it recorded a loss of $620,000.Richard Jewell, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television, Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p45 =Critical reception= The Magnificent Ambersons is regarded as one of Welles's masterpieces. In The Los Angeles Times, Kevin Thomas argued, \\"Although reams have been written about the mutilation of Orson Welles's second feature, what remains of it is nevertheless a major accomplishment\\". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called its mise-en- sc√®ne \\"extraordinary\\" and wrote that the film contains some of the finest acting in American cinema. The Magnificent Ambersons placed 81st in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made; it also received four directors' votes, one of which was that of Terence Davies. =Accolades= In 1991, The Magnificent Ambersons was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film was included in Sight and Sound's 1972 list of the top 10 greatest films ever made, and again in the 1982 list.

Formed in 1857 it is one of the oldest and largest police forces in the country with just over four thousand sworn police officers serving an area of 1,433 square miles (3,710 km2) and a population of over 1.8 million. Area and organisation The force covers an area of with an approximate population of 1,800,000 (roughly 1,600,000 in Kent, and 250,000 in Medway). The Chief Constable is currently Alan Pughsley, QPM who was appointed in 2014. Kent Police was the first force in the United Kingdom to be led by a black Chief Constable, Michael Fuller QPM, who was in office from 2004 to 2010. Due to the Channel Tunnel, Kent Police is unique among English forces in having a police station outside of the country, in Coquelles, France, staffed by Kent Police. Kent Police work with other UK and European forces as part of the Cross Channel Intelligence Community, helping to tackle cross-border crime. The cross channel traffic occasionally causes Kent Police and the Highways Agency to enforce Operation Stack, controlling the freight flow on that part of the M20 motorway closest to the ports. Kent also has the largest strategic road network of any force in the UK, covering four motorways. Proposals made by the Home Secretary on 20 March 2006 saw Kent Police stay as a standalone strategic force for Kent; it had been suggested that Kent should merge with another police force. The Port of Dover maintains its own independent police force, the Port of Dover Police, however, Kent Police has statutory responsibility for policing the entire county and will take over primacy of serious investigations and incidents within the port when appropriate. Police stations and vehicles The force operates over 20 police stations and offices with public access as of 2020 throughout the county. They are located in from A-Z: Ashford, Canterbury, Cranbrook, Dartford, Dover, Faversham, Folkestone, Gravesend, Herne Bay, Maidstone, Margate, Medway (Gillingham), North Kent (Northfleet), Paddock Wood, Rainham, Ramsgate, Sevenoaks, Sittingbourne, Tonbridge, and Tunbirdge Wells. Seven of these stations contain full time operational dedicated custody suite areas with a total capacity of 163 cells for the detention of arrested suspects. These custody suites are located in from A-Z: Canterbury with 15 cells, Folkestone with 15 cells, Maidstone with 19 cells, Margate with 15 cells, Medway (Gillingham) with 40 cells, North Kent (Northfleet) with 40 cells, and Tonbridge with 19 cells. Additionally the force operates two special stations, one located at Bluewater on the site of the large Bluewater shopping centre complex with a small 3 cell custody suite, and one located at Longport near Folkestone for use connected to the Channel Tunnel and also as a dedicated TACT custody suite containing 4 cells for suspects held for terrorism offences. The force operates a large fleet of vehicles to aid in policing needs around the county ranging from patrol to prisoner transport to forensics. As of 2020 the standard incident response vehicles (used to immediately respond to emergency calls) are the Ford Focus Estate 1.6TDCI and the Vauxhall Astra Mk7 Sports Tourer 1.6CDTi. They perform the bulk of patrol and response needs. They replaced the 2 litre Skoda Octavia estate vehicles that were used between the mid 2000's to the mid 2010's period as the forces IRV's. Additionally smaller Ford Fiesta 1.5TDCi and Skoda Fabia vehicles are used for general patrol duties and also by the nearly 300 police community support officers (PCSO's, unsworn uniformed support officers) to perform local neighborhood policing around the county. More equipped high performance and specialist vehicles are used by the forces Traffic Unit and Tactical Firearms Unit (TFU, deployed to more high risk incidents predominantly involving firearms) for use in traffic enforcement, highways policing, and specialist/high risk needs, they include the Volvo V70, Volvo V90, BMW 530D, BMW 330D, BMW X5, Land Rover Defender (armoured variant), Jankel Armored Vehicle and OVIK Crossway Armored Vehicle. Motorcycles also include the BMW R1200RT for traffic enforcement and highways policing and the Yamaha WR450F for off-road policing. For larger specialist vehicle needs the force operates a range of vehicles for use around the county by officers, they include vans like the Mercedes Sprinter, Vauxhall Vivaro, LDV Maxus, and Volkswagen Crafter which are used for officer and prisoner transport. The Ford Transit Connect van is used by forensics officers. Other vehicles used include the Land Rover Discovery, Land Rover Defender, Mitsubishi Shogun, Ford Ranger, and Skoda Octavia estate (K-9 Dog units). As a coastal county the force operates its own small marine unit made up of a single 10 metre Parker Baltic Cruiser RIB with twin 350hp outboard engines and an enclosed cab. The vessel is named \\"Invicta\\" and is used to patrol the county's coastline stretching from the River Thames in the North down and around to the English Channel in the South with its border with Sussex. The force also operates its own small UAV drone fleet that is used in searching for wanted suspects, missing people and general aerial support to ground officers when needed. The nearest police air support unit bases with manned aircraft are located in Redhill, Surrey and North Weald, Essex and are operated by the National Police Air Service. History On 14 January 1857, a 222-strong Kent County Constabulary was formed under Chief Constable John Henry Hay Ruxton. The first headquarters was at Wrens Cross, Stone Street, Maidstone, and was rented for use by the police until 23 November 1860 when the force purchased it for ¬£1,200. It was responsible for policing those parts of the county not already under the jurisdiction of local Borough police forces. In 1860, the initial uniform of a frock coat and a high hat was replaced by a long uniform tunic and shako hat and constables were issued with a rattle and truncheon. In 1885 whistles were introduced and in 1897 the recognisable custodian helmet was introduced. In 1974 the familiar Cox Comb helmet replaced the Rose Top helmet with a new helmet plate. On 1 April 1889, Kent County Constabulary absorbed the borough police forces of Deal, Hythe, Faversham, Sandwich, and Tenterden, five of the fourteen local police forces that then policed boroughs within the county of Kent. The remaining nine were absorbed on 1 April 1943, these being the borough forces of Dover, Folkestone, Gravesend, Maidstone, Margate, Ramsgate, and Tunbridge Wells, together with the Canterbury City Police, and the Rochester City Police. Ruxton retired on 14 August 1894 and died on 20 April 1897. In terms of mobilisation and communication, Kent Constabulary purchased 20 bicycles in 1896, a number which rose to 129 by 1904. Telephones were given to village police constables in 1925 and by 1931, 29 motorcycles had been introduced, along with one police car. The constabulary employed horses until 1943, when the last was retired. This horse was called Bess. In 1965, the force had an establishment of 1,988 attested constables and an actual strength of 1,766, making it the third largest county force in Great Britain.The Thin Blue Line, Police Council for Great Britain Staff Side Claim for Undermanning Supplements, 1965 Kent County Constabulary was the last British force to keep the word \\"county\\" in its official title. It changed its name to Kent Police in 2002. The main argument for the change was that the large number of visitors coming through the Channel Tunnel and the ports would understand the word \\"Police\\" more readily than \\"Constabulary\\". The Kent Police headquarters are located at Sutton Road, Maidstone. Kent Police College is located to the rear of the headquarters site. The headquarters houses the Kent Police Museum. After years of personnel cuts announced in 2010 and starting in 2011 that saw officer numbers fall from a peak of almost 3,800 in 2010 to under 3,200 by 2016, it was announced in March 2018 that Kent Police would launch the largest recruitment campaign in its history aiming to recruit over 200 more officers over the next one to two years. This was made possible due to an increase in the tax funding the police receive from county residents. The campaign has so far been successful with dozens of new constables passing out in 2018 with dozens more undergoing training into 2019. Once completed the campaign should bolster the number of sworn constables in Kent to over 3,400. It was further announced in January 2019 that the PCC Matthew Scott was proposing another tax increase in the 2019/20 period in the amount of money Kent Police receive from county residents in order to recruit a further 180 officers by 2020. If this proposal is approved and additional officers are recruited this would take the total number of sworn officers in Kent to upwards of 3,600 by 2020. This tax increase for 180 additional officers was approved in February 2019 and as of early 2020 have since all been recruited into the force bringing the total number of sworn officers to just over 3,600. As part of the national campaign announced by the government in late 2019 to recruit 20,000 more police officers across all of the 43 police forces in England and Wales by early 2023 it was announced that Kent would receive government funding to recruit 147 officers in the first wave of 6,000 in 2020 with the other 14,000 expected in 2021 and 2022. Additional funding for 34 more officers was also underwritten by the police crime commissioner bringing the total number of extra funded officers in 2020 to 181. When all recruited these additional officers will bring the total number of sworn officers in Kent to just over 3,800 by early 2021 giving Kent Police its largest amount of officers since the force was formed. X26 Tasers were introduced to Kent police in 2009 for rank and file officers, although only Response vehicle drivers were issued with them. Each Response vehicle had to be double crewed with both crew members carrying Taser due to the safety implications, and to allow proper care and control of a Tased individual. In March 2019 it was announced that all frontline officers in a public-facing role who could regularly face violence in the course of their duty will be able to volunteer to undertake taser training and carry a taser whilst on duty if they choose to. Presumably this would mean at least all officers who conduct patrol and emergency response duties would be able to undertake taser training. This measure is partly due as a result of a large increase in weapon crime in Kent and throughout the country as a whole. In 2017 new two-shot X2 tasers were approved for use by officers and have gradually replaced the older single-shot X26 models. Areas covered (Divisions) Until November 2011 the force was formed into six BCU's, as shown below: *North Kent (Dartford, Gravesend) *South Kent (Folkestone, Dover, Ashford) *East Kent (Canterbury, Herne Bay, Whitstable, Thanet) *West Kent (Tunbridge Wells, Tonbridge, Cranbrook, Sevenoaks, Swanley) *Mid Kent (Maidstone, Sheppey, Sittingbourne, Faversham) *Medway (Strood, Rochester, Chatham, Gillingham, Rainham) Plans to reduce the six BCU's to three divisions were drawn up in 2010 The new force Divisions came into being when the existing BCU's were formally dissolved in November 2011, they are structured as follows: *North Kent & Medway Division (Dartford, Gravesend, Sheppey, Sittingbourne, Faversham and Medway) *East Kent Division (Ashford & Folkestone and Hythe, Canterbury & Dover and Thanet, *West Kent Division (Maidstone, Tunbridge Wells, Tonbridge, Cranbrook, Sevenoaks, Swanley) Neighbourhood policing will be carried out at a district level with an extra 400 constables transferred into it. Crime investigation and emergency response will be managed at a central level from the Force Command and Communication Centre. Specialist functions will remain centrally managed. On 6 April 2011 it was announced that the 3 new areas will each be commanded by a Chief Superintendent and Superintendent. Each individual town within each area will be commanded by a Chief Inspector. All emergency response handled from HQ in Maidstone. All response officers will be Standard and Advanced level. 2011 budget cuts Kent Police cancelled their last scheduled intake of trainees for the Regular (paid) force in February 2011. They were due to commence their training at the end of March. =Future of Kent Police= In a report published by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in July 2011,HMIC (July 2011).

On 22 March 2011 former Kent Assistant Chief Constable David Ainsworth (then Deputy Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police) was found dead at his home. He had hanged himself. Essex Police and Kent Police set up a joint Serious Crime Directorate (SCD) in 2010, to help share intelligence.

Episode 1 showed the work of the officers and staff at Medway's custody suite and episode 3 showed the force's call centre at Maidstone and the emergency response officers in Medway BCU.  In Literature  The 2010 book Stab Proof Scarecrows is written by a former police constable who served with both Kent and The City of London Police. It is highly critical of both Kent Police and the situation of policing in general. In 2010 then-Assistant Chief Constable of Kent Police, Allyn Thomas sent a letter to every officer in the force reassuring them that senior officers did not give the book any credibility. Historical and notable incidents In 2006, Kent Police dealt with the biggest cash robbery in the history of British policing - the Tonbridge Securitas depot robbery. Kent police investigated the theft of ¬£53m, with six men being sentenced to a total of 156 years imprisonment. In June 2007 Anne Sanderson was shot dead by an armed officer in Sevenoaks, Kent after being seen with what was later identified as a ball bearing gun. It was the first fatal shooting of a woman by UK police in 27 years (and first time ever that the shooting was deliberate). A subsequent IPCC investigation and an inquest jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.Police use of firearms in the United Kingdom#Fatal incidents Officers killed in the line of duty or while reporting for duty The Police Memorial Trust lists and commemorates all British police officers killed in the line of duty, and since its establishment in 1984 has erected over 38 memorials to some of those officers.

It was named after Skuld from Norse mythology.  Discovery  Skuld was discovered on 2 September 1929, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The body was independently discovered by astronomers and fellow countrymen Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Wachmann at the Hamburger Bergedorf Observatory ten nights later. It was first identified as at Heidelberg in 1906, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 23 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Orbit and classification  Skuld is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony S-type asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.7 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,215 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Skuld, one of the three Norns in Norse mythology. The asteroids 167 Urda and 621 Werdandi are named after the other two Norns. Naming citation was first mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = In January 2004, the first rotational lightcurves of Skuld were obtained by Henk de Groot and by a group of Polish and French astronomers. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 4.73 and 4.8079 hours with a brightness variation of 0.46 and 0.40 magnitude, respectively (). In 2009 and 2011, astronomers Robert Buchheim and Larry Robinson obtained two well-defined lightcurves from photometric observations. They gave a refined period of 4.810 and 4.807 hours with an amplitude of 0.50 and 0.26 magnitude, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Skuld measures between 9.63 and 11.009 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1995 and 0.302. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this orbital family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 9.99 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.17.

Historically, it was also used to help perform an emergency stop should the main hydraulic brakes fail. Parking brakes often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes, which is then connected to a pulling mechanism. In most vehicles, the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, a straight pull handle located near the steering column or a foot-operated pedal located with the other pedals. Overview In vehicles with automatic transmissions, the parking brake was originally intended for emergency stopping (for instance, if the foot brake completely failed due to a loss of hydraulic pressure or other malfunction). As safety regulations became more stringent in the 1980s, and modern brake systems became more reliable (using dual-circuit hydraulics and low-brake-fluid sensors),5.2.3 unece.org the likelihood of brake failure reduced; in most cases this failure might be indicated through a brake warning light appearing on the dashboard. In the event of brake failure, the parking brake lever should be slowly engaged to prevent locking up the wheels and reduce speed. While most automatic transmission vehicles have parking brakes, it is often not engaged by drivers when parking. However, it is recommended to use it, as the parking pawl in the gearbox could fail due to stress or another vehicle striking the car, causing the car to roll. Also, regular use of the parking brake reduces the chance of corrosion by keeping the cables in-motion. In manual transmission vehicles, the parking brake can be engaged to help keep the vehicle stationary. When parking on an uphill gradient, it is recommended that the front wheels face away from the curb. This would prevent the car from rolling into the roadway by using the curb as a block on the front tire in the event of a parking brake failure. Similarly, on a downhill gradient, the front wheels should face the curb for the same reason, and the wheels should face to the right on an uncurbed road regardless of orientation. In a manual transmission, leaving the car in first gear (or in reverse if pointing downhill) is also advised, as the engine will prevent the car from rolling if the parking brake fails. The parking brake in most vehicles is still completely mechanical. Traditionally engaged by pulling a lever, the cables manually engage part of the car's braking system, usually the rear disk or drum brakes. The mechanical nature allows the driver to apply the brake even if the main hydraulic brake system fails. =Other uses= In manual and automatic transmission vehicles, the parking brake can also be used for various driving situations which require the vehicle to be momentarily stopped. For example, the brake can be engaged when moving off an uphill slope, as this allows the driver to hold the accelerator and clutch pedals steady without the vehicle rolling backwards. Other common situations is when the vehicle is stopped at a traffic light, a pedestrian crossing, or simply waiting to turn in front of oncoming traffic. The parking brake would ensure the car is secure, should another vehicle come into physical contact from behind, causing the car to jolt forward. It is not recommended to use the parking brake when the vehicle is in-motion, unless there is a problem with the main brakes, as this can lock the back wheels and cause a skid. This is known as a handbrake turn, which is often performed in street racing and off- road rally racing to initiate rear wheel drift.  Parking brake variations  ISO symbol used to indicate that the parking brake is appliedThe position of the parking brake differs between vehicle models and manufacturers. However, a universal feature is either one or two of the warning lights which appear on the dashboard when the parking brake is engaged.Brake warning light = Center or stick lever = The most common placement of the parking brake is in the center console of the vehicle, in between the driver and front passenger seats. Operating the brake is performed by pulling the lever up (which is connected to a ratchet) until there is tension. To disengage the brake, the button is held while simultaneously pulling the lever up to disengage the ratchet and then pushed all the way down with the button still held. In older vehicle models, a stick lever may be used instead which is located under the instrument panel. = Pedal or pull handle = Some vehicles have the parking brake operated by a small foot pedal, located by the other pedals. Depressing the foot pedal would engage the brake and pressing it again will release it. A pull handle variation also exists; by pulling or releasing the handle, this engages and releases the parking brake, respectively. Many vehicles have a combination of the two; a pedal to engage the brake and a handle to release it.Electric park brake on a 190x190px =Electronic= A recent development is the electronic parking brake, also known as an electric park brake. Introduced to the mainstream market in 2001, it was first used in the 2001 BMW 7 Series (E65). Two variations are available: In the more-traditional \\"cable-pulling\\" type, an electric motor simply pulls the parking brake cable on the push or pull of a button rather than a mechanical lever or pedal in the cabin. A more complex unit (first seen on the 2003 Audi A8) uses a computer-controlled motor attached to each of the two rear brake calipers referred to as the Motor on Caliper (MoC) system. Many car manufacturers such as Jaguar, Land Rover, BMW, Renault, Subaru and Volkswagen sell models whereby the parking brake automatically engages when the vehicle is stopped and is released when the gas pedal is pressed, eliminating the need for the driver to operate a button. An extension of this system, known as hill-hold or hill-assist, prevents the vehicle from rolling back when moving-off on an uphill gradient. Types of brakes In vehicles with rear disc brakes, the parking brake either actuates the disc calipers (with much less force) or a small drum brake housed within the hub assembly (the inner circumference of the disc is often used instead of a separate drum). This secondary drum parking brake is often referred to as a banksia brake. It is usually used in conjunction with rear disc brakes employing multi-piston calipers, as mechanically actuating these calipers is more difficult than single piston calipers. Another less common setup for rear discs is the use of a separate, smaller, cable actuated caliper (such as the Wilwood MC4), which is used exclusively for the parking brake. This is sometimes used as an alternative to a separate drum parking brake when multi- piston main calipers are used. Hudson automobiles used an unusual hybrid hydraulic-mechanical dual-brake system which operated the rear brakes through the otherwise conventional mechanical parking brake system when a failure of the hydraulic system allowed the pedal to travel beyond its normal limit. A number of production vehicles, light and medium duty trucks, and motor homes have been made with a separate drum brake on the driveline; called a transmission brake. This has an advantage of being completely independent of other braking systems. This is effective when there are multiple driving axles, all driven wheels are braked at once. A line lock is a temporary parking brake that makes use of the vehicles standard hydraulic brakes. They are often used for off road conditions or when stopping on steep grades is required. By trapping hydraulic pressure in the brake lines, all four wheels can be locked. = Jacking = Whilst most vehicles have the parking brake applied to the rear wheels, some car models of Citroen, Alfasud, Saab and early Subarus apply the parking brake force to the front wheels. Therefore, it is important to know which wheels are providing the braking action when lifting the car with a jack. If one lifts the braking wheels off the ground, then the car could roll off the jack and cause injury to those near the vehicle. It is recommend that jacking be conducted on a flat surface and with chocks immobilizing the wheels that will remain on the ground. Large vehicles Large vehicles are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans as well as some older heavy vehicles. These operate in the same way as a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off. Power operated parking brakes are fitted to heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure being used to hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system is that if a vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs. Railroad hand brakes Virtually all railroad rolling stock is equipped with manually operated mechanical hand brake devices that set and release the brakes. Most of these involve a chain linked to the brake rigging, most often at the brake cylinder, that when tightened pull the piston out against the releasing springs, thus applying the brakes on the car (if there is only one brake cylinder per car) or bogie (if there is more than one cylinder per car). Newer locomotives have electric systems that simply place an electric motor in place of the chain winding mechanism. This brake acts independent of the action of the automatic air brakes, which function collectively when coupled in a train and are under the control of the locomotive driver / engineer. Manual hand brakes serve to keep a piece of rolling stock stationary after it has been spotted in a rail yard or at a customer for unloading or loading. They are also used to secure a parked train from inadvertent movement, especially while unmanned. Before the development of locomotive-actuated train braking systems in the late 19th century, designated railroad employees known as brakemen would move about the tops of cars, setting hand brakes in an effort to stop the train in a timely manner. This process was imprecise and extremely dangerous. Many brakemen lost life and limb as a result of falling from a moving train, icy and wet conditions often adding to the hazards involved in negotiating the top of a swaying boxcar. In the U.S., an 1893 federal law, the Railroad Safety Appliance Act, required automatic brakes on all railroads, effective in 1900.United States. Act of Mar. 2, 1893, , recodified, as amended, .

Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information It was originally thought to be an ancestor of Ceratosaurus, due to the similar small crest on its snout. Now, however, it is considered a coelurosaur, specifically one of the earliest known members of the clade Tyrannosauroidea. The type specimen is held in the Natural History Museum in London and was recovered in 1910 from oolitic limestone of the White Limestone Formation near Minchinhampton while excavating for a reservoir. Classification Estimated size compared to a human Arthur Smith Woodward, who initially studied Proceratosaurus, originally thought it to be an ancestor of the Late Jurassic Ceratosaurus, due to the similarity of their nasal crests. Later study during the 1930s by Friedrich von Huene supported this interpretation, and Huene thought both dinosaurs represented members of the group Coelurosauria.von Huene, F. (1932). \\"Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte.\\" Monographien zur Geologie und Palaeontologie (Serie 1), 4: 1‚Äì361. It was not until the late 1980s, after Ceratosaurus had been shown to be a much more primitive theropod and not a coelurosaur, that the classification of Proceratosaurus was again re-examined. Gregory S. Paul suggested that it was a close relative of Ornitholestes, again mainly due to the crest on the nose (though the idea that Ornitholestes bore a nasal crest was later disproved). Paul considered both Proceratosaurus and Ornitholestes to be neither ceratosaurs nor coelurosaurs, but instead primitive allosauroids. Furthermore, Paul considered the much larger dinosaur Piveteausaurus to be the same genus as Proceratosaurus, making Piveteausaurus a junior synonym. However, no overlapping bones between the two had yet been exposed from the rock around their fossils, and future study showed that they were indeed distinct. Several phylogenetic studies in the early 21st century finally found Proceratosaurus (as well as Ornitholestes) to be a coelurosaur, only distantly related to the ceratosaurids and allosauroids, though one opinion published in 2000 considered Proceratosaurus a ceratosaurid without presenting supporting evidence. Phylogenetic analyses by Thomas R. Holtz, Jr. in 2004 also placed Proceratosaurus among the coelurosaurs, though with only weak support, and again found an (also weakly supported) close relationship with Ornitholestes. The first major re-evaluation of Proceratosaurus and its relationships was published in 2010 by Oliver Rauhut and colleagues. Their study concluded that Proceratosaurus was in fact a coelurosaur, and moreover a tyrannosauroid, a member of the lineage leading to the giant tyrannosaurs of the Late Cretaceous. Furthermore, they found that Proceratosaurus was most closely related to the Chinese tyrannosauroid Guanlong. They named the clade containing these two dinosaurs the Proceratosauridae, defined as all theropods closer to Proceratosaurus than to Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus, Compsognathus, Coelurus, Ornithomimus, or Deinonychus.

Now the Albrecht D√ºrer House museum. Bernhard Walther (1430June 19, 1504) was a German merchant, humanist and astronomer based in Nuremberg, Germany. Walther was born in Memmingen, and was a man of large means, which he devoted to scientific pursuits. When Regiomontanus settled in Nuremberg in 1471, they worked in collaboration to build an observatory and a printing press. After the death of Regiomontanus in 1476 at Rome, Walther bought his instruments, after Hans von Dorn, commissioned by the Hungarian king, had tried in vain about it with the council of Nuremberg. Thenceforward, he continued the observation of planets till his death in Nuremberg. His house, purchased in 1509 by Albrecht D√ºrer, is nowadays a museum. Astronomy Walther further brought into prominence the effects of refraction in altering the apparent places of the heavenly bodies, and substituted Venus for the moon as a connecting-link between observations of the sun and stars. As a result, his observations are the most precise prior to those of Tycho Brahe. His pupil Johannes Sch√∂ner made unpublished data of Walther's observations of Mercury available to Nicolaus Copernicus. There were 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in \\"De revolutionibus\\", giving only longitudes, and erroneously attributed them to Sch√∂ner. These values differed slightly from the ones published by Sch√∂ner in 1544 in Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4¬∞, Norimb. 1544]., a collection of the astronomical observations of Regiomontanus and Walther, as well as manuscripts of Regiomontanus, which had been in the possession of Walther. In 1618, Willebrord Snell noted them as an appendix to his Observationes Hassiaceae. Equipment In 1484 Walther introduced clocks driven by weights, their first use in astronomical determinations. His printing press was used to produce some of the earliest astronomical publications. Legacy Walther is the eponym of lunar crater Walther. Works *Regiomontanus, Johannes: Opera Collectanea.

It is made up of eleven Local Policing Teams, whose boundaries are matched to the nine local authorities within Staffordshire. History pre-1968 Staffordshire police helmet, in the collection of Staffordshire County Museum A combined force covering Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent, called Staffordshire County and Stoke-on-Trent Constabulary, was established on 1 January 1968, as a merger of the Staffordshire County Police and Stoke-on-Trent City Police. This force lost areas to the new West Midlands Police in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 and adopted a shorter name.Home Office circular (link no longer functioning, and document not found on http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/circulars) Under proposals made by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, it would have merged with Warwickshire Constabulary, West Mercia Constabulary and West Midlands Police to form a single strategic force for the West Midlands region. However these plans have not been taken forward largely due to public opposition. For 2005/06 Staffordshire police topped the Home Office chart as being the best performing police force in England and Wales. Organisation Staffordshire Police is one of two forces involved in the Central Motorway Police Group along with West Midlands Police. This unit provides roads policing for the motorway network in the West Midlands (mainly M5, M6 and M42). Staffordshire Police has no other roads policing capacity; this was disbanded in 1999 during the major force reorganisation that also saw the mounted branch disbanded. In September 2008, the force announced that it intended to vacate the Cannock Road site and sell it for housing development, moving HQ staff to Lanchester Court, next to the existing Weston Road premises. Staffordshire Police Authority, a separate organisation charged with oversight of the force, had 9 councillors (drawn from both Staffordshire County Council and Stoke-on-Trent City Council), 3 justices of the peace, and 5 independent members. It was abolished in November 2012.

The programs Chief Officer is Chief Superintendent Elliot Sharrad William. The programs Deputy Chief Officer is also the DCO (Deputy Chief Officer) of the Special Constabulary; the cadets force also has many Special Constables, Regular Constables and PSV's (Police Service Volunteers) that assist in the running of the units. The Volunteer Police Cadet Scheme was set up by PCC Matthew Ellis in 2014 after he watched a television program on the BBC's CBBC. It has a ranking system similar to that of the Special Constabulary. This ranking system contains a head cadet, deputy head cadet, section leaders, and then the rank of cadet. There is also a ranking system for the volunteer leaders. This contains a unit commander, deputy unit commander, leaders, young leaders. The rank insignia is the same as the Special Constabulary in the sense of using bars to represent the rank (for example the rank of Section Leader is equal to the rank of Sergeant and has the same Insignia as one bar on each shoulder).{} Police and crime commissioner In November 2012, the first Staffordshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Matthew Ellis, was elected. The Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner and the individual elected is responsible for reducing crime and making the area they represent safer. The PCC decides how much council tax people will pay towards community safety services and policing and is personally accountable for all the public money spent.

The show is set in a fictional summer camp run by John Candy. Twenty-seven episodes of the series aired during the 1989 and 1990 television seasons on the NBC television network. Thirteen new episodes ran in syndication in the 1992 season, distributed by Worldvision Enterprises, along with repeats of the previous episodes. The series was later rerun on the Fox Family cable channel from 1998 to 2001. In the third season, Candy also appeared in live action segments, talking about nature and ecology. Harry Nilsson wrote the series' theme song, which Candy sang. In both versions, the closing credits featured songs about Camp Candy that were sung to the tune of various traditional camp songs such as ‚ÄúBingo‚Äù (spoofed as ‚ÄúCandy‚Äù), ‚ÄúMiss Lucy‚Äôs Steamboat,‚Äù ‚ÄúOn top of old smoky,‚Äù ‚ÄúYankee doodle boy‚Äù (parodied as ‚ÄúBig John Candy‚Äù), ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll Be Comin‚Äô Around the Mountain‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze‚Äù (Parodied as ‚ÄúCircus Parade\\"). The animated series spawned a brief comic book series based on the show; also entitled Camp Candy, it was published by Marvel Comics' Star Comics imprint. Episode formula Almost all episodes would begin where John Candy would be trying to show an outdoor skill to some kids, to which he would then say it reminded him of a story, where he would tell of the episode in narration. John was a dedicated leader of Camp Candy, a summer camp that is presumably built by him, and he tries to get various kids to get along. The children included: * Robin McHale - a nature-loving African- American girl. * Alexandra Dawson - a redheaded tomboy who is into sports. * Vanessa Carter - a rich valley girl and snobbish fashionista. * Iggy Jarvis - a bespectacled hypochondriac. * Gregory \\"Binky\\" Jarvis - Iggy's more adventurous younger brother, and the youngest member of the gang. * Rick Rogers - an amateur but talented prankster. * Theodore - A chubby blonde kid who only appears in the third season. Adult characters included Nurse Molly, a nurse who had a crush on John, but he never seemed to take notice, as he was interested in an attractive redheaded receptionist called Miss Sweetingham. Another adult added during the second season was a man from an unnamed Eastern European country named Botch, who worked as the camp cook and was a basketball junkie, being seen shooting hoops or in some sports-related activity when not working. John's main antagonists were Xavier \\"Rex\\" DeForest III ‚Äî a man who seeks to demolish Camp Candy in order to make way for a condominium, and Chester ‚Äî a dimwitted greaser employed by DeForest. Another antagonist included Hob Nayles, a strict disciplinarian who headed the rival Camp Kickboot and sought to humiliate John, but was really a coward at heart.

As of September 2018 the force had a strength of 1,357 police officers, 127 special constables, 192 PCSOs and 1,072 police staff. Of the 45 territorial police forces of the United Kingdom, the force has the 5th largest geographic area of responsibility whilst being the 15th smallest force in terms of police officer numbers.  History  The force was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, and was largely a successor to the York and North East Yorkshire Police, also taking part of the old West Riding Constabulary's area. The York and North East Yorkshire Police had covered the North Riding of Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire and the county borough of York; it was itself formed in 1968 from a merger of the two riding forces with the York City Police. Proposals made by the Home Secretary on 21 March 2006 would have seen the force merge with West Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Police and Humberside Police to form a strategic police force for the entire region. However, these proposals were later dropped. It was announced in January 2007 that the then Chief Constable, Della Cannings, would be retiring from the force on 16 May 2007 due to illness. Della Cannings made the headlines on a number of occasions. She was not allowed to purchase wine from Tesco in Northallerton in March 2004 until she had taken off her hat and epaulettes, as it was illegal to sell alcohol to on-duty police officers. In October 2006 it was revealed that more than ¬£28,000 had been spent to refurbish a shower in her office. On 19 April 2007, it was announced that Grahame Maxwell was to become the new Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police. Grahame Maxwell began his career with Cleveland Police and served in all ranks up to Chief Superintendent when he became District Commander in Middlesbrough. After completing the Strategic Command Course in 2000, he was appointed as an Assistant Chief Constable with West Yorkshire Police and during his four years there served as the ACC Specialist Operations and ACC Territorial Operations. Mr Maxwell was promoted to Deputy Chief Constable with South Yorkshire Police in January 2005 and become the Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police on 17 May 2007. Dave Jones QPM, was appointed as chief constable in 2013 after serving as Assistant Chief Constable at the Police Service of Northern Ireland, where he had command of the Rural Division. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 2017 New Year Honours List and retired from the role in 2018. In July 2017, the force's headquarters was moved from Newby Wiske to Alverton Court in Northallerton. The new headquarters is the former offices of the Rural Payments Agency . The previous headquarters at Newby Wiske is a grade II listed building and was becoming difficult to upgrade into the 21st century. The memorial stones commemorating those who have served the police in the region have been moved to the new headquarters from Newby Wiske. These include those who have died in the First and the Second World Wars and also those who have died in the line of duty. In August 2018, it was confirmed that Lisa Winward would become the new chief constable with immediate effect. Winward joined the police in 1993 and has been serving in the North Yorkshire police service since 2008. Vehicles A North Yorkshire Police car responds to an emergency call in York Currently, used patrol cars include the Peugeot 308 and Vauxhall Astra. The Ford Kuga is used as a patrol car in some rural areas. The Roads Policing Group (RPG) use the BMW X5, BMW 330d and BMW 530d. BMW motorcycles are also used by the RPG. Iveco Daily and Ford Transit vans are used for the transportation of detainees and to transport officers on public order duties. The Firearms Support Unit use the BMW X5. The force has a new livery from March 2009, consisting of high visibility panels of yellow and blue on all vehicles, this is known as battenberg.

It is located in Lower Manhattan, adjacent to the Brooklyn Bridge and City Hall. Bergtraum offers business-oriented courses to prepare students for careers in marketing, tourism, finance, human resources, information systems, economics, computer science, law, and secretarial fields. The school also combines its business curriculum with an academic program that gears towards preparation for college. In recent years, the school has been integrating more humanities and liberal arts courses to enrich the school's curriculum.Inside School's Profile of Murry Bergtraum Murry Bergtraum High School was one of the first business-themed high schools in New York City, and inclusively, the United States. It has two sister schools that share its business theme: Norman Thomas High School (previously known as Central Commercial High School) and the High School of Economics and Finance. Out of the three schools, Murry Bergtraum is the largest of all the business high schools in this category and in the city due to its large, diverse business programs and course offerings. It remains as one of the few large high schools in New York City as a result of Michael Bloomberg's small-school restructuring projects.Financial Women's Association Committees - Mentoring . Fwa.org. Retrieved on 2013-10-05. It was also exempted from chancellor Joel Klein's citywide uniform curriculum initiated in 2003. History The school was established in 1975, in memory of Murry Bergtraum, a former President of the New York City Board of Education who died in 1973. Bergtraum joined the Board of Education on May 20, 1969. He was then elected President of the Board of Education from July 1, 1970 to June 30, 1971. His widow Edith Katz Bergtraum, a public school teacher, was also politically active and a member of her local school board for 19 years. After her death in 1994, an elementary school in Queens (PS 165 in District 25) was renamed in her memory. The name \\"Bergtraum\\" originates from the German language. In the English language, it translates to \\"mountain dream\\". Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers was still under construction in 1975 while the first class of freshmen were attending classes at Pace University awaiting the completion of the new high school. While at the Pace campus, an art instructor held a school logo contest. Many designs were submitted by the students. Ultimately the winner chosen by the staff was a student named Norberto Feliciano. The winning school emblem is circular in design with a triangle in the center that represents the schools aerial view shape. The name of the school is within double circles, and the school initials placed within the triangle. Olive branches were placed within the logo as a sign of peace as also seen in the flag of the United Nations. The logo is used on letter heads, notebooks, T-shirts, sweatshirts, shorts, team uniforms, and other school-branded items. Bergtraum was the first academic comprehensive high school with business majors in New York City and one of the first in the United States. It was supported by the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association to prepare young people to enter the world of work and college.Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers, M520, Borough of Manhattan, Zip Code 10038 Murry Bergtraum High School, along with other high schools of the Lower Manhattan area were the first schools evacuated during the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. Although Bergtraum is located in the Lower East Side section of Manhattan, the school administration ordered an immediate evacuation of the building. The building was evacuated in three minutes. It was the first high school in New York City that had successful evacuation of students. The school was labeled as a \\"Ground Zero\\" school (by the NYFD)--students were relocated to the High School of Art and Design in Upper Manhattan. The Bergtraum administration were unhappy with the relocation and appealed it, and their building was re-opened and students resumed their studies within a few days. Bergtraum began to face new ideas of reform during the Spring Term of the 2005‚Äì2006 academic school year. Due to certain measures to improve both performance and student morale, new measures and new plans began to be introduced by the Principal and the School Leadership Team. Some of the reforms included: *The attempt to restore the Bergtraum building after 31 years of establishment. * A sharp decrease in the number of students admitted into the school. Incoming freshmen classes averaged to about 900 to 1000 students. , that number is down to approximately 800. The school currently faces a 131% overcrowding rate‚Äîthat is, there are 36% more students than the building was designed to accommodate. *The introduction of a new dress code to bring a more professional environment to the school.

Bergtraum has also been known for its unusual triangular shape, which leads to only half of the school building having windows. The exterior sides of the building have windows, while the interior portion of the building does not. Despite the design of the building, it stays very warm in the winter and very cool during the summer because of its centralized air-conditioning system. As of spring 2007, the school would follow a 1-8 schedule, eliminating the 3-10 and leaving very few students with a 2-9 schedule. As of September 2009, the school began to decrease its enrollment numbers to alleviate the overcrowding rate the school faced. The school's enrollment has dropped significantly from September, 2005 in which it had roughly 3,000 students enrolled. As of July 2009, that number has decreased to 2,589. School facilities Murry Bergtraum's facilities include: *Three Gymnasiums. Two are on the same floor, but offer different electives.

History of discovery In 1923, German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene wrote a paper on Jurassic and Cretaceous European carnivorous dinosaurs. In this paper, he examined a specimen (OUM J.12144) including an incomplete hip, a leg bone, and part of a backbone, assigning it to a new species of Megalosaurus: Megalosaurus parkeri. The specific name honours W. Parker who in the nineteenth century had collected the fossils near Jordan's Cliff at Weymouth. These bones were from the Oxford Clay Formation, which dates to the Upper Jurassic. In 1932, however, von Huene concluded it was a species of Altispinax, A. parkeri. In 1964, scientist Alick Walker decided these fossils were too different from Altispinax, as they lacked the long vertebral spines, and named the new genus Metriacanthosaurus. The generic name is derived from Greek metrikos, \\"moderate\\", and akantha, \\"spine\\". Metriacanthosaurus thus gets its name from its vertebrae, which are taller than typical carnosaurs, like Allosaurus, but lower than other high-spined dinosaurs like Acrocanthosaurus. Description Metriacanthosaurus was a medium-sized theropod with a femur length of . Gregory S. Paul in 1988 estimated its weight at . Thomas Holtz gave a length of 8 meters (26.2 feet). Metriacanthosaurus was named for the height of its neural spines, which are actually not overly tall for theropods. They are similar to other theropods such as Megalosaurus, Sinraptor, and Ceratosaurus in being 1.5 times the height of the centrum. Classification Originally named as a species of Megalosaurus in Megalosauridae, Metriacanthosaurus was more likely a member of Metriacanthosauridae. It is thought to be related to genera such as Yangchuanosaurus, and in 1988 Paul synonymized the two genera. However, a 2007 review of British dinosaurs by Darren Naish and David Martill found that they were distinct. Metriacanthosaurus is likely a member of the subfamily Metriacanthosaurinae.

It is 9 miles and 7 chains from Porthmadog and is at 510 feet above sea level.  History  The halt was established in 1965 to serve Plas Dduallt, a small Welsh Manor House (just below the railway) dating in part from the 15th century, and where Oliver Cromwell is said to have stayed during his campaign against the Royalists of North Wales. Colonel Andrew Campbell bought the house in 1962 and undertook a complete restoration. Road access to Plas Dduallt is recent and during the 1960s the Colonel kept his own locomotive on a siding by the halt. He ran his own train to and from Tan-y-Bwlch under running powers granted by the Ffestiniog Railway. The Colonel allowed the use of his outhouses for hostel accommodation for volunteers. He was a licensed explosives handler and as a volunteer he did much of the rock blasting required on the spiral section of the deviation and beyond. A slate seat has been erected at Dduallt in his memory. Campbell's Platform (named in his honour) is a private halt available for use only by residents and visitors staying at Plas Dduallt. Intending passengers must check with the Ffestiniog Railway Company before embarking on their journey. Plas Dduallt has been on Most Haunted in its 2008 series for paranormal investigations. Coed-y- Bleiddiau Between Campbell's platform and Tan-y-Bwlch is Coed-y-Bleiddiau cottage, a private residence that was built c1860 for the Ffestiniog Railway's Inspector of the Line. The cottage is over half a mile by steep footpath from the nearest road, and in the 1930s it was used as a holiday home by several families, including those of Granville Bantock the composer and Kim Philby the Russian spy. This cottage also has its own private railway platform, which displays a name board. The location features on the map in the Traveller's Guide, but not on the company web. Coed-y-Bleiddiau has recently been restored by the Landmark Trust, and is now used for self-catering holiday lets.

The mission of the AIDS Memorial Grove is to provide a healing sanctuary and to promote learning and understanding of the human tragedy of the AIDS pandemic. Introduction Congress and the President of the United States approved the ‚ÄúNational AIDS Memorial Grove Act‚Äù in 1996, which officially set aside the deLaveaga Dell land in Golden Gate Park as the site for the first AIDS memorial in the nation. The Grove continues through the additional generosity of services and financial support given by numerous individuals, corporations, and foundations. Thousands of community volunteers have ensured over 20 years that continuous gardening and regular maintenance occurs, along with periodic enhancement projects, to keep the landscape vital and sense of place beautiful. The Grove serves as an important sanctuary for people, from locals to world visitors, a refuge for memories and a place of new enjoyment. ::\\"Most memorials are built after the struggle is over.

Suffolk Constabulary is responsible for policing an area of , with a population of 678,074 and 288,473 households. The area covered is principally rural and coastal and the force has two territorial areas: Eastern and Western. The Eastern Area HQ is at Halesworth, the Western Area HQ at Bury St Edmunds. Each area is divided into sectors, with boundaries matching those of local district or borough councils. There are a total of 14 sectors across the county, each commanded by an inspector or chief inspector. It was previously overseen by a police authority consisting of nine councillors, three justices of the peace and five independent members, but in common with other English and Welsh forces outside London is now responsible to a Police and Crime Commissioner. The current Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner is Tim Passmore of the Conservative Party. Steve Jupp is the current Chief Constable and has been in role since the 10th of April 2019. Organisation =Air Operations Unit= The National Police Air Service (NPAS) currently operates the helicopter from Wattisham Airfield serving Suffolk and East Anglia. However the NPAS announced in February 2015 that Suffolk's police helicopter base is set to close with plans for 10 bases to be closed across the country to take effect in the 2016/2017 financial year. This will then leave Boreham near Chelmsford as the closest base to Suffolk. =Dog section= As part of continued savings for Suffolk Constabulary, In 2011 the Suffolk and Norfolk Constabularies dogs sections collaborated. The new unit consists of 25 Police Constable dog handlers and overseen by two Police Sergeants and an Inspector. The unit uses Home Office licensed general purpose dogs that are either German Shepherds or Belgium Malinois. In addition a number of handlers operate specialist search dogs capable of detecting either cash, drugs, firearms or explosives. For this role the Constabulary uses a number of breeds including Spaniels and Labradors. =Roads policing= Officers part of the Traffic Police are responsible for the policing the two main road networks in Suffolk, the A14 and the A12, in addition to the county's highways. The department uses Automatic Number Plate Recognition on many of the unit's vehicles to reduce vehicle crime, including identifying vehicles without relevant documents or insurance. The unit also conducts targeted campaigns to increase public awareness of dangers on the road, these are divided into five main elements from the National Roads Policing Strategy: * Reducing the number of road casualties. * Denying criminals use of the roads. * Preventing anti-social use of motor vehicles. * Enhancing public confidence and reassurance by patrolling the county's roads. * Countering terrorism. Two vehicles of Suffolk Constabulary responding to an emergency call =Firearms unit= The firearms unit in Suffolk Police is known as the Tactical Firearms Unit (TFU) made up Authorised Firearms Officers (AFO) and also have a specialist rifle team. The TFU are trained in conflict management and method of entry, they are trained to use specialist equipment to gain quick entry into properties and regularly assist with search warrants. Armoury: * Glock 17 self-loading pistol * G36 Carbine * TMR1 7.62mm rifle * Heckler & Koch 5.56 mm rifle * Remington pump action shotgun. A more recent addition is the Heckler and Koch baton gun. This fires a 'plastic baton round' and provides officers with a less lethal option. TFU officers also have the X26 Taser available for deployment as another less lethal option. The Taser operates by discharging two barbs, which attach to the clothing, or penetrate the skin of the person. This creates a circuit through which 50000 volts of electricity is passed causing temporary incapacitation.

The force formed from the merger of West Suffolk Constabulary and East Suffolk Constabulary. Those forces had previously been merged in 1869 and the split again in 1899. The most recent merger took place in 1967, which also saw the Ipswich borough police merged. In 2006 Suffolk Constabulary merged the role of traffic warden with that of PCSO. Those traffic wardens that did not wish to pursue this role either retired or took employment elsewhere. Proposals announced by the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke on 20 March 2006 would have seen the force merge with neighbouring forces Norfolk Constabulary and Cambridgeshire Constabulary to form a strategic police force for East Anglia. However, the proposals were later abandoned. = Chief Constables = *1967‚Äì1968 : Sir Peter Jack Matthews (formerly Chief Constable of East Suffolk and afterwards Chief Constable of Surrey, 1968‚Äì72) *<1970‚Äì1976 : Arthur Burns *1976‚Äì1983 : Stuart Leonard Whiteley *1989‚Äì1998 : Anthony Thomas Coe *1998‚Äì2002 : Sir Paul Joseph Scott-Lee (afterwards Chief Constable of the West Midlands, 2002) *2003‚Äì2007 : Alastair McWhirter *2007‚Äì?? : Simon Ash *2013‚Äì2015 : Douglas Paxton *2016 : Gareth Wilson *2019 : Steve Jupp Notable investigations Suffolk Constabulary gained widespread attention in December 2006, when it began to investigate the murder of five women working as prostitutes in the Ipswich area. The murders generated media interest both nationally and internationally. The inquiry was the largest mounted by Suffolk Police in its history. The disappearance of Corrie McKeague launched another unusually large investigation, involving officers from other constabularies and civilian volunteers.

Allosauridae is a fairly old taxonomic group, having been first named by the American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878.Marsh, Othniel Charles (1878). \\"Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles\\". American Journal of Science and Arts. 15: 241‚Äì244. Allosaurids are characterized by an astragalus with a restriction of the ascending process to the lateral part of the bone, a larger medial than lateral condyle, and a horizontal groove across the face of the condyles.  Description  Allosaurids have a general anatomy typical of other neotheropod dinosaurs, contributing to the difficulty in defining the family's membership. A typical 8m specimen of Allosaurus fragilis had a skull of about 0.85m. The premaxilla has five teeth and the maxilla usually around 16. The dentary also typically has 16 teeth. All teeth are serrated and continuously replaced throughout the life of the animal. Allosaurid skulls are characterized by two sets of crests formed by the nasal and lacrimal bones respectively. These crests would have been covered by keratin sheathes.Madsen, James H., Jr. (1993) [1976]. Allosaurus fragilis: A Revised Osteology. Utah Geological Survey Bulletin 109 (2nd ed.). Salt Lake City: Utah Geological Survey. The skull also exhibits features consistent with significant cranial kinesis: a synovial joint between the braincase and the frontals and a loose articulation between the dentary and the angular/surangular.Paul, Gregory S. (1988). Predatory Dinosaurs of the World. This cranial kinesis would have dampened forces on the bones of the skull and allowed allosaurids to open their mouths to very large angles. Allosaurids have 28 precaudal vertebrae (9 cervical, 14 dorsal, 5 sacral) and an estimated 45-50 caudal vertebrae. Gastralia and ferculae are rarely preserved as fossils but are presumed to occur in all allosauridsChure, Daniel J.; Madsen, James (1996). \\"On the presence of furculae in some non-maniraptoran theropods\\".

Like most other theropods, allosaurids have very short forelimbs relative to their hindlimbs with three digits on the hand and four on the foot. The first digit of the hand forms a semi-opposable thumb and digits 4 and 5 are absent. Digits 2-4 of the foot are robust but digit 1 is reduced and does not touch the ground and digit 5 is absent.Gilmore, Charles W. (1920).

Despite the name, the force's area does not include North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire, which are covered by Humberside Police instead. In terms of geographic area the force is one of the largest in the England and Wales covering 2,284 square miles. The population of the area covered by the force is 736,700. As of 2010 the force currently employs over 2,500 people. As at May 2016, there were 1,100 police officers, 200 Special Constables and 149 PCSOs.  History  Lincolnshire Constabulary was formed in 1856 under the County and Borough Police Act 1856. Several other borough police forces used to exist in the county, but these were eventually combined with the Lincolnshire force. Under the Police Act 1946, Boston Borough Police and Grantham Borough Police were merged, while Lincoln City Police and Grimsby Borough Police were absorbed under the Police Act 1964. Lincolnshire lost part of its area to the new Humberside Police in 1974. In 1965, the force had an establishment of 918 officers and an actual strength of 883.The Thin Blue Line, Police Council for Great Britain Staff Side Claim for Undermanning Supplements, 1965 Proposals made by the Home Secretary on 20 March 2006 would have seen the force merge with the other four East Midlands forces to form a strategic police force for the entire region. These proposals were ended by John Reid in June 2006. The police authority received ¬£287,600 from the Home Office for costs of preparing the ill-fated merger. In 2008 the Lincolnshire Police Authority experienced a funding crisis. The authority claimed that the central government grant was insufficient to provide efficient policing in Lincolnshire, due to the unfavourable working of the formula used by the government to assess police grants. The authority decided to reduce the shortfall by making a 79% increase in its precept (the portion of Council Tax payable to the Police Authority). The government then announced its intention to \\"cap\\" this demand, resulting in a net 26% increase. District structure The Chief Constable is Bill Skelly. Lincolnshire Police has an establishment of about 1,100 police officers. In 2011, the force underwent major changes to its organisation; divisions went and front line officers were organised into Neighbourhood Policing Teams (NPT) and Response (area cars). Previously there were three \\"divisions\\" (West, East, & South) with Lincoln, Skegness, and Grantham hosting the divisional headquarters of each. The county is divided into four \\"districts\\" for the purposes of policing. These areas each effectively pair two district/borough council areas into one policing district, and are: * Lincoln & West Lindsey (covering Lincoln Gainsborough, and Market Rasen) * North & South Kesteven (covering Grantham, Sleaford, North Hykeham, Bracebridge Heath, Market Deeping, Bourne and Stamford) * Coast & Wolds (covering Skegness, Mablethorpe, Louth and Horncastle) * Boston & South Holland (covering Boston, Spalding, Holbeach, and Sutton Bridge). The force has round the clock armed response vehicles manned by Roads Policing Officers (RPU). Front line officers in Lincolnshire also carry Taser electronic incapacitating devices. These use electricity to cause neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI) to render subjects incapable of free bodily movement for a short period of time whilst the device is operating. Taser is carried in addition to PAVA incapacitant spray. Officers previously used CS spray, however this was removed from service due to it being flammable (if used in conjunction with a Taser it could set alight). PAVA is a non flammable spray liquid. Officers from Lincolnshire are also detached to EMSOU, East Midlands Special Operations unit. The force has its own underwater search unit that consists of one part-time team of around ten officers and this unit is based permanently at the Lincolnshire Police Headquarters.http://www.lincsmag.com/Lincolnshire/002_Lincolnshire_Police_Underwater_Search_Unit.html Lincolnshire Police Underwater Search Unit Other departments As with all police forces, Lincolnshire Police has many specialist departments aside from the officers and PCSOs that respond initially to calls from the public. These include the Roads Policing Unit (who also form the force's firearms response), Dog section, Public Protection Unit (including specialist sexual offences officers), Scenes Of Crime, Custody suites, and the Force Control Room. In addition to this are other support departments such as IT and HR. Officers and Police Staff forming these departments are based across the county, but most having their main office at Force Headquarters in Nettleham. Lincolnshire Police operates a Special Constabulary that has approximately 200 officers from the rank of Special Constable to Special Superintendent. Officers are based throughout the county out of local police stations. Lincolnshire Special Constabulary also has offices deployed in specialist units such as wildlife crime and Safer Roads unit. As of July 2018 Lincolnshire Special Constabulary is recruiting.

Anything in creation not in the House ‚Äî such as Earth, the Solar System, and, indeed, this Universe ‚Äî is part of the Secondary Realms. The House is divided into seven demesnes, each ruled by a master who shares their name with a day of the week ‚Äî the Trustees, or Morrow Days. The demesnes, in the order Arthur Penhaligon has claimed them, are as follows: the Lower House, the Far Reaches, the Border Sea, the Great Maze, the Middle House, the Upper House and the Incomparable Gardens. Description The House's physical appearance in the Secondary Realms is described as a vast building featuring many different architectural styles, which often appear to be brought together at random. Its physical location differs; Arthur first sees it near his own residence, and his friend Leaf sees it above a hospital. Arthur, Leaf, and Leaf's ally Sylvie are the only mortals shown to see the House, each by a different means: Arthur can see it presumably because he is the Heir of the Architect; Sylvie requires special glasses given to Leaf by the House Sorcerer Dr. Scamandros; and Leaf appears able to see it without aid. It is her belief that she has inherited powers of extrasensory perception from her grandmother, whom she thinks to have been a witch, but this has not been confirmed. A possible alternative suggests that her immersion in the House (which occurred prior to her view of it from outside) enabled her to see it. The House has seven demesnes: the Lower House, Far Reaches, Border Sea, Great Maze, Middle House, Upper House, and the Incomparable Gardens. The Gardens are the uppermost part of the House. The Lower Coal Cellar acts as a basement; it is infinite and houses the ancient prison of the Old One. Purpose The divine figure known as the Architect created the House to record, without intervening on any behalf, all that happened in the Secondary Realms (that is, the Universe at large). Most Denizens of the House believe that the House was created first, but this is only true of the Incomparable Gardens. Having created House, Realms, and a Law that would prevent Denizens from intervening in the actions of mortal creatures, the Architect vanished and is not shown again. The Law is not binding however (although in 'Grim Tuesday', Arthur repels two agents from the House by invoking the Original Law, along with his latent power gained from the use of the First Key); it can be broken, as all of the Architect's Trustees have done at one time or another, making themselves the villains of the story. A Trustee can only enter the Secondary Realms on their \\"day\\", i.e. Mister Monday can only enter the Secondary Realms on a Monday. Furthermore, the Superior Denizens (Dawn, Noon, and Dusk) of each day can only enter the Secondary Realms on the hour of their name (a Noon, for example, can only enter during the hour from 12:00pm to 1:00pm). House Time is constant, while time in the Secondary Realms is malleable; it is even able to flow backwards if a sufficient power, such as a Key to the Kingdom, is used upon it. Thus, a day may pass on Earth while half a year will pass in the House. This inconsistency in time allows Arthur to spend large amounts of time in the House whilst 'Local Earth Arthur time' remains still. This occurs because the Front Door (the main method of transit between the House and the Secondary Realms) takes note of important people's travel (e.g. Arthur's passage through the Door) and alters the time it allows passage back accordingly. The system is not infallible; while Leaf is in the House, time continues as normal in the Realms (Sneezer states that the Door did not consider Leaf noteworthy enough to account for). This temporal system is not dissimilar to that used in the Chronicles of Narnia, wherein lengthy adventures or even lifetimes can be spent in Narnia's world while only seconds pass in ours. Denizens Denizens are the original inhabitants of the House. Denizens are ranked within the House in an order of Precedence, but the current hierarchy of ranking is unknown. A Denizen's social status, political role, and magical power appear to be synonymous, in that magical power over an item is given or taken in the same way as if it were political power. Denizens are similar to humans in all aspects but these: * The blood of a Denizen is blue with two unexplained exceptions, while the bones are golden. * Denizens are very resistant to change of any kind, and are often described as narrow-minded or stupid. * Denizens are naturally good-looking. Additionally, if a Denizen's House Precedence is high, he or she is better-looking and taller than Denizens of lower precedence. * Denizens are nearly immortal: **Denizens cannot die of old age, sickness, dehydration, or starvation while in the House, and will eventually heal from almost any injury, including decapitation. Denizens normally value sicknesses from the Secondary Realms. If the body is destroyed, they can slowly grow a new one, though they can be prevented from doing so. The ability to survive without food or drink while within the House, as well as not dying from old age, extends to Mortals and Piper's Children, although the resistance to injury does not. **Denizens can only be killed by ***Fire, superheated steam, or other sources of extreme heat; ***Certain weapons (such as the Commissionaires‚Äô Clubs and various weapons used by the Glorious Army of the Architect); ***A prolonged absence of their heads; without sorcerous intervention ***Exposure to Nothing; ***A festering bite or scratch from a Nithling, which dissolves them into Nothing; ***A Key; ***Drowning (although, this does not completely kill them immediately); and ***Falling from at least 15,000 feet. Demesnes =The Lower House= The Lower House was the domain of Mister Monday. Due to Monday's affliction with sloth, its bureaucratic affairs became impossibly inefficient until Monday's loss of power, after which Dame Primus, as the Steward of Arthur's regime, has attempted to make the Lower House manageable. The remaining Morrow Days have attempted to impede this effort by swamping the Lower House with paperwork. The Lower House is guarded by the Corps of Inspectors, by the robots known as Metal Commissionaires, by Denizen Commissionaire Sergeants, and by Midnight Visitors. These are under the control of the office of Monday's Dawn, Noon, and Dusk, respectively.Mister Monday, Garth Nix Doorstop Hill, and on it the Front Door of the House, is located in the Lower House. The Front Door of the House is a means by which one may leave the House and enter a Secondary Realm, and vice versa. To enter it from the Secondary Realms, one must be able to see the House. It is a pair of wooden doors surrounded by constantly shifting wrought-iron patterns whose movements are mesmerizing to human eyes. The Door is guarded by the Captain Keeper; in his absence, the Lieutenant Keeper of the Door, an ally of Arthur's, has guarded it ever since. The Coal Cellar is a deep pit in the Lower House where Denizens that have been punished are sent to mine and shape coal for delivery to buyers within the House. The Old One is also imprisoned here. He is bound by two chains extending from a minute and hour hand on a clock face. When both hands reach twelve, two clockwork figures appear and gouge out his eyes. This is the punishment laid upon him by the Architect for his attempting to interfere in the Secondary Realms, which was directly forbidden by the Architect. His escape is impossible; according to Monday's Dusk, the Seven Keys combined could not free him. In Lady Friday, Dr. Scamandros mentions that something odd is happening in the Coal Cellar; not with the Old One, but the collectors. The nature of what is happening is not stated. It is revealed in Superior Saturday that flowers have started growing around the Old One's clock-face prison, and that his clockwork torturers have been destroyed by the Old One and that he will soon be able to escape. The Seven Dials is a set of seven grandfather clocks in a room accessible from Monday's Dayroom, the main office of the Lower House. Using them, one can travel to the current time in any given Secondary Realm. Thus far, only Sneezer, Monday's butler, has operated them. When the Lower House was consumed by Nothing, Dr. Scamandros says that the Seven Dials would move themselves to safety, but did not reveal where they had gone. Nearly all of the Lower House was destroyed by Nothing that had leaked from the dam in the Far Reaches, being unleashed by Superior Saturday. The bulwark between the Lower House and the Far Reaches only lasted a few hours, during which important records and some Denizens were saved. However, the bulwark eventually collapsed and the Lower House was devoured. Only part of the Deep Coal Cellar survives, due to the protections around the Old One's prison; but it is slowly dissolving as the prison weakens. =The Far Reaches= The Far Reaches was the domain of Grim Tuesday. Originally, the Far Reaches was a Grand Cavern, and in the Cavern was a steady spring of Nothing. Tuesday used the Nothing to create items, such as Commissionaires and Not-Horses, which he sold to other demesnes of the House. His avarice, however, drove him to deepen and widen the spring in an effort to find more Nothing. In time, the spring became a vast Pit, which eventually becomes the whole of his demesne, sparing only his Treasure Pyramid and the train station where his personal train into the Pit docks. Grim Tuesday used indentured slaves from his own demesne, as well as ones from other Morrow Days sent to him as payment, to mine the useful amounts of Nothing. The Pit is extremely dangerous as it has been dug deep into the foundations of the House and is very close to breaching into the void of Nothing beyond. After Grim Tuesday was deposed, Dame Primus received regency over the Far Reaches and ordered their Denizens to fill the Pit, but was unable to have this task completed before the Far Reaches were destroyed by a wave of Nothing released by Superior Saturday. The entire demesne was consumed by the wave of Nothing in four to five minutes, and the Immaterial dam wall was breached by sorcerous drills. During the interim before this event, many of the things produced by Grim Tuesday for the other demesnes had become scarce as a result of the cessation of production caused by Dame Primus' orders. The treasure tower is also the place where Arthur meets Tom Shelvocke, the second son of the Architect and the Old One. Tuesday hid the only way possible to get to Part Two of The Will in his treasure tower where Tom helps Arthur steal theHelios and go get the Will. =The Border Sea= The Border Sea was an ocean previously under the rule of Drowned Wednesday. After Wednesday transformed into a leviathan and submerged into the sea, the sea overflowed nine-tenths of all land in the demesne including Port Wednesday. A new port was partially prepared on Wednesday's Lookout before this deluge. Any of the buildings that were submerged were transformed into ships, which thereafter sailed the Border Sea along with Wednesday's original fleet of 49 ships. A unique aspect of the Border Sea is that anything that is lost accidentally, but not stolen, will appear in it. The Border Sea extends into any body of water in the Secondary Realms, and therefore can be a means of travelling anywhere. The Line of Storms, a series of vicious lightning storms, guard the entrance into the sea; only an express invitation into the Sea will prevent the Line from killing people instantly. Raised Rats live here and pilot their steamships. Pirates also live here, of whom the most formidable was a mortal pirate who somehow passed the Line of Storms into the Border Sea, Elishar Feverfew. Feverfew was a mortal pirate who entered the House and mastered the art of House Sorcery. He learned many dark sides of sorcery that others such as Dr. Scamandros would not willingly use. Due to his experimentations with Nothing he is no longer fully human. At the end of Drowned Wednesday, Wednesday's Dawn informed Arthur that much of the Sea had extended into the Void of Nothing, and since Wednesday used all of the Key's power keeping her shape, had not reined it in. As Arthur does not wish to use the Keys unless absolutely necessary, he left this task to his Steward Dame Primus. In Lord Sunday, the Sea is revealed to be destroyed by a wave of Nothing. =The Great Maze= The Great Maze is a demesne that was ruled by Sir Thursday. It is a gigantic, chessboard-like arrangement of one thousand by one thousand terraformed tiles, whereof each is one mile long and one mile wide. At each sunset the tiles change their locations, allowing any attackers to be split and easily attacked by the Glorious Army of the Architect; a means known as Tectonic Strategy. There are several fixed tiles, such as the Citadel, Fort Transformation, and a few others. The Citadel is the main Headquarters of the Maze, where Thursday himself makes his residence, and Fort Transformation is where new recruits spend a year of training before going on to serve the last 99 years of their tenure in one of the various factions in the Army. Tile 500/500, one of the four central tiles, is the ‚Äúmaster tile‚Äù of the Maze, in that no other tile may move its location unless this one is unhindered. Therefore, to fasten it in place (as in the novel Sir Thursday) is to render the Maze immobile. At one end of the Maze is a mountain range. Within this range is a tunnel that connects to the Void of Nothing, by which controlled amounts of Nithlings are allowed into the Maze so that the Army may fight them. There are four gates within the tunnel; one gilded in gold, one in silver, one in bronze, and finally an Immaterial gate, the ‚ÄúCleargate‚Äù. Each gate is operated by a single lever in the Border Fort above the tunnel. The gates are opened in various ways depending on the amount of Nithlings Sir Thursday wishes to be brought into the Maze. During Sir Thursday, all four gates were opened against rules, whereupon a vast, uncontrollable amount of Nithlings entered the Maze. Unlike the Nithlings Denizens are used to fighting, these Nithlings are smart, organized, and near-Denizen in their attributes. It is revealed that these Nithlings are under the command of the Piper. The New Nithlings then took control of the Border Fort, and kept the gates open past when they were to be closed, allowing huge numbers of New Nithlings to enter. After the deposition of Sir Thursday, the New Nithlings still controlled much of the Maze, despite their losses in a battle against all Denizens loyal to protagonist Arthur. As of Superior Saturday, the Citadel became the base of Arthur's operations in the absence of the Lower House and Far Reaches. When the New Nithlings damaged the mountain wall that barricaded the Maze from the Void of Nothing, this put the Maze in danger of dissolution. During Lord Sunday, the Glorious Army of the Architect flees to the safety of the Middle House after Dame Primus was unable to deal with the damage to the mountain shield. Suzy appears and quickly is whisked away by a rearguard led by Marshal Dusk as Nothing dissolved the Citadel. Later when Leaf became Lieutenant Keeper of the Front Door, she sensed the Great Maze collapse into the Void. =The In Between House= The Middle House is a giant, thrice- terraced mountain consisting of three large plateaux previously under the control of Lady Friday. The plateaux are connected by the Extremely Grand Canal, a waterway whose water transports any writing to its desired destination. The workers of the Canal wear clothes made of out of paper covered with writing so that they float if they fall into the water. In Lady Friday, due to Friday's obsession with experiencing, it became thoroughly wintry. Each of the plateaux, or ‚Äúshelves‚Äù, serves a different function. The bottom, and the largest, called the Flat, is location of the Guild of Gilding and Illumination and of Letterer's Lark. The next shelf, the Middle of the Middle, houses the Guild of Illustration and Augmentation. Finally, the Top Shelf has the High Guild of Binding and Restoration. In between the Top Shelf and the crest is a crack in the mountain leading to the Eyrie of the Winged Servants of the Night, which included the former prison of the Fifth Part of the Will. On the very crest of the mountain is Lady Friday's Scriptorium, where, in Lady Friday, she leaves a replica of her Key, in hopes of killing Arthur, the Piper, and Saturday. This trap, although it failed, opened onto the Void and managed to destroy the entire Scriptorium and a good portion of the mountain top; however Arthur, using all of the four Keys under his control, managed to stop the void but was unable to fill the gap it left behind. At the end of Lady Friday, Arthur granted Dame Primus Stewardship of the Great Maze and the Middle House, although he retained the Fifth Key. In Superior Saturday, the bulwark between the Middle House and the Lower House was weakening due to erosion caused by Nothing. The Lower House and Far Reaches had been destroyed when the Pit was breached and the two demenses were consumed by the Void of Nothing. Dame Primus is told that a geyser of Nothing has sprung nearby Letterer's Lark and, upon Arthur's insistence, splits into two parts, Dame Quarto and Dame Septum; one to deal with the bulwark of the Middle House, now the only protection of the Middle House against the Void, and the other to repair the mountain barrier of the Great Maze. Towards the end of Lord Sunday it is consumed by the void. =The Higher House= The Upper House was ruled by Superior Saturday. It is in the Upper House where House Sorcerers are trained. The Upper House consists office units on moveable scaffolding, which Piper's Children are employed to maintain and move as directed. In Lady Friday and Superior Saturday, Superior Saturday tries to stop the phone connection to the Lower House, the Far Reaches, the Border Sea, the Great Maze and the Middle House, but is unable to do so because the metaphysical wiring falls under the authority of the Far Reaches and the phone operators are located in the Lower House. This demesne is in perpetual rain, due to the fact that the Sixth Part of the Will was broken up into type and dispersed into the water. The Denizens working here have umbrellas to stop the water, but these are sometimes ineffective. Higher Denizens also collect water and let it drop in waterfalls on their inferiors. This enabled the Will to communicate with Arthur. The papers they work on stay dry despite the rain. The ceiling of the Upper House is actually the floor of the Incomparable Gardens and is shrouded usually in clouds. Sunday constantly taunts Saturday by parting the clouds only for her, exciting her envy. Saturday, for almost ten thousand years, has been building a tower with her private viewing chamber at the top while the other floors are slotted in below. The purpose of the tower is to reach and invade the Incomparable Gardens above and claim it for herself. Within the Upper House are four large Drasil trees located at the four corners of the Upper House that are constantly growing at a rate faster than Saturday can build her tower. As these trees grow, the Incomparable Gardens move further upwards. The tower is seventeen thousand feet high, and the Denizens that work in the tower all have different coloured umbrellas which can be used to determine the part of the tower in which they work. The basic building blocks of the tower are wrought iron cubes with a grille floor and no ceiling. In order to stop the trees from growing, Saturday engineered the destruction of the Lower House and Far Reaches with the use of sorcerous drills that destroyed the dam wall of the Pit in the Far Reaches. The Nothing devoured the two demesnes, cut off the trees' lowest roots, and therefore stunted their growth enough to permit invasion. In Lord Sunday, the assault by Nothing on the bulwark of the Middle House destroys the main roots of the Drasils, and the Incomparable Gardens falls about a hundred metres into Saturday's Tower. It is then destroyed when a wave of Nothing created by the Architect's Will's completion destroys it. =The Incomparable Gardens= The Incomparable Gardens are Lord Sunday's demesne. It is supposedly the most beautiful garden in existence, and is guarded by a variety of insectoid Nithlings resembling oversized worms and beetles. Dame Primus mentions that Denizens of this area of the House would be immediately noticeable in the Great Maze. The floor of the Incomparable Gardens is the roof of the Upper House and is constantly rising thanks to the four Drasil trees which support it and grow to raise it. The branches of the trees attack anyone who comes near, and beetle-like Nithlings guard the trunks of the trees. It has been revealed by the Sixth Part of the Will that the Incomparable Gardens, rather than the entire House, is the Epicenter of the Universe and therefore essential to the universe's survival. At the end of Superior Saturday, Saturday breaks through the ceiling and reaches the Gardens, emerging into a croquet lawn. During Lord Sunday, a fierce struggle ensues between Sunday and his legions of insects and troops, and Saturday with her army of Sorcerous Supernumeraries and other dangerous foes. The Piper, fleeing from the onslaught of Nothing which annihilated the Lower House, the Far Reaches and the Great Maze, is hot on her heels. Arthur and the Glorious Army of the Architect, which now contains every Denizen under the command of Arthur and Dame Primus, take refuge in the Middle House before launching a surprise attack on Saturday's tower which breached the floor of the Gardens. They are trapped between the Piper's Newniths and Saturday's reinforcements, which flood into the Gardens to join the fight. The Elysium, where Sunday makes a stand against the invading forces, was the first place to emerge from the Void, along with the Architect. The Seventh Key is strongest here, able to sense approaching troops and create natural disasters to halt them. It is possible that the Incomparable Gardens represent the Garden of Eden. Transportation and communication within the House =The Front Door= Controlled by the Captain and Lieutenant Keepers of the Door, the Front door is a huge three mile wide/tall dome. Every inch of the walls are filled with portals to parts of the house, for example the Upper House. Some protrude into the Secondary Realms and the Void. In Lord Sunday, Leaf becomes Lieutenant Keeper, and senses the Void exploding through many of the entrances. She is there when the Great Maze collapses onto itself and the Realms are infected. The entrance to the Front Door takes the form of a huge door a hundred metres high and fifty metres wide. From the start of Mister Monday, trouble occurs inside the Door. Superior Saturday, self-proclaimed superior sorcerer, sends her Dusk on many occasions, mostly through the Front Door. She sent him to kill Suzy and destroy the Border Dam in the Far Reaches. Access to the Front Door is restricted, allowed only where the Door flows, like a huge ocean. Looking too much at the infinitely complex designs on the Door causes blindness and intense madness, such things may have happened to the Piper and some nithlings. One of the side portals is Monday's Postern, which catapults the receiver straight into the Door. In Grim Tuesday, the Lieutenant Keeper sends Arthur to the Far Reaches to overthrow Grim Tuesday and gain sovereignty over the Far Reaches. He also sends Leaf to the Great Maze, as well as Suzy. =Wings= Wings are an everyday means of short-distance travel within the demesnes of the House. When used, they most often take on an angelic quality (i.e. white and feathered), but can have other appearances. Monday's Noon's wings are described as \\"white and lustrous\\" but stained with dried blood,Nix, Garth. Mister Monday. First ed. New York: Scholastic Paperbacks, 2003.Monday's Dusk's wings are black and \\"as glossy and dark as a raven's\\", and Pravuil uses wings that are yellow. There are also different types of wings. Cheaper, paper-made wings are disposable, and are made for temporary use. They are unidirectional (up or down) and the user can only partially control them by leaning in the desired direction.Nix, Garth. Grim Tuesday. First ed. New York: Scholastic Paperbacks, 2004. Higher-quality wings can be taken on and off at will and are controlled by telepathy. Some of the higher-quality wings have special properties, such as the ability to shed light or generate invisibility in the Secondary Realms. Wings are banned in some areas of the House because of various air-borne hazards. In the Pit in the Far Reaches they attract Nothing from the clouds and this Nothing often forms flying Nithlings. Monday's Dayroom has a protective system against intrusion by fliers, in that superheated steam is shot at anyone who tries to fly over head. In the Upper House, Drasil branches invariably destroy any users of wings who fly above a certain height, however Saturday is able to circumvent this by using sorcery to repel the boughs. In the Great Maze, wings attract lightning (which is somehow related to the tile movements). =Postage service= The House has an internal postage service, but this appears to be notoriously poor. Letters take weeks, or sometimes years, to reach their destination; most do not reach at all. This is due mainly to the disorder in the Lower House and has apparently grown worse prior to Mister Monday's downfall, having all the letters and newspapers cut off completely in some of the House, according to Piper's Child Fred Initial Numbers Gold. It is revealed in the fourth book that if a Denizen does not accept the military draft offered him, the Denizen will be turned into a brown-paper-wrapped parcel and transported through the postage system to the Great Maze. =Elevators= Elevators are currently the easiest way to travel between the demesnes of the House, save the Fifth Key, which lets the user go to any reflective surface in existence if its user has been there by another means. As the elevators fall under the authority of Superior Saturday, they are banned from the realms controlled by Arthur as of Lady Friday. The size of an elevator can vary greatly; it can be the size of a telephone booth or of a football field. When the elevator is in motion, its path is marked by a beam of light. In the Border Sea, elevators can only travel to Port Wednesday, as the rest of the realm is submerged. The elevators can be controlled by either the elevator's operator, Superior Saturday, or (probably) Lord Sunday. =Weirdways= Weirdways are pathways that exploit the veins of Nothing within the House. One is able to go through the Nothing via a dark corridor with soft and jellylike walls, floor and ceiling. Weirdway entries are often disguised as innocuous items within a room, such as a painting or coin on the floor or a clock, and they cannot be moved. According to Suzy Turquoise Blue, only the blood of one of the Morrow Days can close a weirdway. =Transfer plates= Large discs that work as a sort of teleportation throughout existence. Transfer plates are usually electrum or (more rarely) fine china. Touching a transfer plate, intentionally or not, will automatically transfer a being to the prescribed destination of the transfer plate. The plates can be controlled by Superior Saturday. =The Improbable Stair= The Improbable Stair is a stairway that can traverse all of creation. It was the Architect's personal transport by which she visited all of her work. To enter the Stair, one must first have an item of power, such as a Key or the Piper's Pipes. The traveler must then see a resemblance to a stair in any object, such as a bent blade of grass or jagged crack in a surface, and imagine the presence of a true stairway. There are several landings on the Stair, of which all open seemingly at random onto a place and time. Having reached a landing, the traveler must return to the Stair by the mentioned process. The entire use of the Stair is described as risky and dangerous, and these risks increase when the destination is near Nothing. Some Denizens cannot travel on the Stair (the reason for this is unknown); but Piper's Children are always accepted. The Improbable Stair has been used five times: * Arthur Penhaligon and Suzy used the Stair in Mister Monday to travel from the Coal Cellar to Monday's Dayroom. * Sir Thursday uses the Stair in Sir Thursday to reach square 500/500 to destroy the giant spike of Nothing which was built by the Piper to freeze the squares in the Great Maze. He takes with him Arthur, Suzy, Fred, and nine other children. * The Piper uses the Stair in Lady Friday to get himself to a safe place when a trap disguised as the Fifth Key opens into the Void of Nothing. * Arthur, Suzy, Fred, and the Fifth Part of the Will use the Stair near the end of Lady Friday to quickly get back to Monday's Dayroom. * Arthur uses the Stair in Lord Sunday to save himself after falling off Saturday's tower, and again to escape from a dangerous planet of battling insectoids. =Telephones= Telephones are a means of communication within the House, and also to the Secondary Realms. The ring is inaudible to mortals, save Arthur and Leaf. House telephones resemble an early form of terrestrial telephone, and seem to work in the same fashion, in that they require an operator. During Lady Friday, Superior Saturday attempts to prevent Arthur from using them; but as they fall under the authority of the Lower House, and their wiring under the authority of the Far Reaches, she has limited success. The telephone operators are especially willing to connect Arthur, as he is the only one to give them the courtesy of saying \\"please\\". =The Fifth Key= Lady Friday's Mirror, the Fifth Key to the Kingdom, allows the user to summon a portal to any part of the House or the Secondary realms coming out through a reflective surface, most commonly a pool of water or a mirror on the wall. The places the mirror can access are limited to locations that the wielder has previously visited by other means. Presumably, this limitation extends to Arthur, the new master of the Fifth Key after the events of Lady Friday, as well. =The Lieutenant Keeper's Sword= Albeit restricted to the Front Door, the sword pulls the holder to wherever they need to go. For example, Leaf needed to check up on the Secondary Realms and was pulled at full force through the interior of the Door. However, the sword attaches itself to the Lieutenant Keeper and cannot leave the Door unless powerful sorcery is used on it.

The story portrayed the takeover of an American car plant by a Japanese corporation (although the title is an Americanized Chinese expression, for \\"work\\" and \\"together\\"). Most of the movie was filmed on location in the Pittsburgh area with additional scenes shot in Tokyo and Argentina. A short-lived TV series based on the film, followed in 1987. Plot The local auto plant in fictional Hadleyville, Pennsylvania, which supplied most of the town's jobs, has been closed for nine months. The former foreman Hunt Stevenson goes to Tokyo to try to convince the Assan Motors Corporation to reopen the plant. The Japanese company agrees and, upon their arrival in the U.S., they take advantage of the desperate work force to institute many changes. The workers are not permitted a union, are paid lower wages, are moved around within the factory so that each worker learns every job, and are held to seemingly impossible standards of efficiency and quality. Adding to the strain in the relationship, the Americans find humor in the demand that they do calisthenics as a group each morning and that the Japanese executives eat their lunches with chopsticks and bathe together in the river near the factory. The workers also display a poor work ethic and lackadaisical attitude toward quality control. The Japanese executive in charge of the plant is Takahara \\"Kaz\\" Kazuhiro, who has been a failure in his career thus far because he is too lenient on his workers. When Hunt first meets Kaz in Japan, the latter is being ridiculed by his peers and being required to wear ribbons of shame. He has been given one final chance to redeem himself by making the American plant a success. Intent on becoming the strict manager his superiors expect, he gives Hunt a large promotion on the condition that he work as a liaison between the Japanese management and the American workers, to smooth the transition and convince the workers to obey the new rules. More concerned with keeping his promotion than with the welfare of his fellow workers, Hunt does everything he can to trick the American workers into compliance, but the culture clash becomes too great and he begins to lose control of the men. In an attempt to solve the problem, Hunt makes a deal with Kaz: if the plant can produce 15,000 cars in one month, thereby making it as productive as the best Japanese auto plant, then the workers will all be given raises and jobs will be created for the remaining unemployed workers in the town. However, if the workers fall even one car short, they will get nothing. When Hunt calls an assembly to tell the workers about the deal, they balk at the idea of making so many cars in so short a time. Under pressure from the crowd, Hunt lies and says that if they make 13,000, they will get a partial raise. After nearly a month of working long hours toward a goal of 13,000‚Äîdespite Hunt's pleas for them to aim for the full 15,000‚Äîthe truth is discovered and the workers walk off the job. At the town's annual 4th of July picnic, Conrad Zwart, the mayor of Hadleyville addresses to the people that Assan Motors plans to abandon the factory again because of the work stoppage, which would mean the end of the town. The mayor threatens to kill Hunt, but Willie, one of the workers, intervenes, insisting that it wasn't Hunt's fault for the closure. The mayor, even more furious with the townspeople taking Hunt's word over his, abandons the picnic. Hunt comes clean about the 15,000 car deal. He responds by addressing his observations that the real reason the workers are facing such difficulties is because the Japanese have the work ethic that too many Americans have abandoned. While his audience is not impressed, Hunt, hoping to save the town and atone for his deception, and Kaz, desperate to show his worth to his superiors, go back into the factory the next day and begin to build cars by themselves. Inspired, the workers return and continue to work toward their goal and pursue it with the level of diligence the Japanese managers had encouraged. Just before the final inspection, Hunt and the workers line up a number of incomplete cars in hopes of fooling the executives. The ruse fails when the car that Hunt had supposedly bought for himself falls apart when he attempts to drive it away. The strict CEO is nonetheless impressed by the workers' performance and declares the goal met, calling them a \\"Good team,\\" to which Kazuhiro replies \\"Good men.\\" As the end credits roll, the workers and management have compromised, with the latter agreeing to partially ease up on their requirements and pay the employees better while the workers agree to be more cooperative, such as participating in the morning calisthenics, which are now made more enjoyable with the addition of aerobics class-style American rock music. Main cast Both Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy turned down the role of Hunt Stevenson. Reception Gung Ho received mixed to negative reviews, and has a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Influence Toyota's executives in Japan have used Gung Ho as an example of how not to manage Americans. This is one of the few films to show the realistic interior of a car factory and its workers performing hectic work on the moving assembly line. Some films use the factory and assembly line as a prop. Vehicles used The Fiat Regata (and Fiat Spazios) were used in various stages of completion.

Early life and the Holocaust  The son of Mark√©ta and Karel Brady and brother of Hana Brady, George Brady lived an ordinary childhood in interwar Czechoslovakia until March 1939, when Nazi Germany took control of Bohemia and Moravia. After that, his Jewish family encountered increasing restrictions and persecution by the German occupiers. By 1942, Brady's parents had been separated from their children and sent to prisons and Nazi concentration camps, perishing in Auschwitz before the end of the Second World War. For a short time, George and Hana stayed with an aunt and uncle; he was not Jewish, and thus the couple was a \\"privileged\\" mixed marriage and not subject to deportation. The children were deported in May 1942\\"Timeline\\" . Hana's Story. Brady family (hanassuitcase.ca). Retrieved 27 July 2015. to Theresienstadt, a ghetto-camp not far from Prague, Czechoslovakia, where George shared Kinderheim L417 with around forty boys including Petr Ginz, Yehuda Bacon, and Kurt Kotouc. George and Hana remained in Theresienstadt until 1944, when they were sent in separate convoys to Auschwitz ‚Äî George in September to the work camp and Hana in October, where she was soon executed in a gas chamber. George was transferred from Auschwitz to Gleiwitz I subcamp, where he worked repairing damaged railway cars. Brady escaped during a death march to Germany in January 1945, the same month Auschwitz was liberated. Interview with George Brady for Show Jana Krause  Life after the Holocaust  Brady traveled until May 1946 when he reached his aunt and uncle in Nov√© Mƒõsto or Czechoslovakia and he learned from them that his parents had died in Auschwitz. After the Communist coup in 1948, he escaped to Austria in 1949 and moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, two years later. Brady made a living in the plumbing trade, in which he had trained in Theresienstadt Ghetto. Early in 1951, he established a plumbing company in Toronto with another Holocaust survivor. He married and became a father to three sons and a daughter. The family resided in Toronto and later on he was made a member of the Order of Ontario in 2008. In 2016, he was supposed to receive an award for his lifelong campaign for Holocaust remembrance from Czech President Milo≈° Zeman on the state day of 28 October. Ultimately, the president decided against conferring the honor on him after Brady's relative, Czech government minister Daniel Herman, met exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama against the president's wishes. Among his many lifetime honors, he was also awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. George Brady died of heart failure in Toronto on 11 January 2019 at the age of 90.

Their skulls have been found in Alberta, Canada and Wyoming. Description Restoration. Leptoceratops could probably stand and run on their hind legs: analysis of forelimb function indicates that even though they could not pronate their hands, they could walk on four legs. Leptoceratops was around long and could have weighed between . Discovery and species Skull The first small ceratopsian named Leptoceratops was discovered in 1910 by Barnum Brown in the Red Deer Valley in Alberta, Canada. He described it four years later. The first specimen had a part of its skull missing, but there were later well-preserved finds by C. M. Sternberg in 1947, including one complete fossil. Later material was found in 1978 in the Bighorn Basin of northern Wyoming. The type species is Leptoceratops gracilis. In 1942, material collected in Montana was named Leptoceratops cerorhynchos, but this was later renamed Montanoceratops. Classification Leptoceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia, a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks that thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period. Although traditionally allied with the Protoceratopsidae, it is now placed in its own family, Leptoceratopsidae, along with dinosaurs such as Udanoceratops and Prenoceratops. The relationships of Leptoceratops to ceratopsids are not entirely clear. Although most studies suggest that they lie outside the protoceratopsids and ceratopsids, some studies suggest that they may be allied with Ceratopsidae. The absence of premaxillary teeth is one feature that supports this arrangement. Paleobiology =Diet= Skeletal restoration. Leptoceratops, like other ceratopsians, would have been a herbivore. The jaws were relatively short and deep, and the jaw muscles would have inserted over the large parietosquamosal frill, giving Leptoceratops a powerful bite. The teeth are unusual in that the dentary teeth have dual wear facets, with a vertical wear facet where the maxillary teeth sheared past the crown, and a horizontal wear facet where the maxillary teeth crushed against the dentary teeth. This shows that Leptoceratops chewed with a combination of shearing and crushing. Between the shearing/crushing action of the teeth and the powerful jaws, Leptoceratops was probably able to chew extremely tough plant matter. Given its small size and quadrupedal stance, Leptoceratops would have been a low feeder. Flowering plants were the most diverse plants of the day, although ferns and conifers may still have been more common in terms of numbers. A 2016 study revealed that Leptoceratops was able to chew its food much like several groups of mammals. See also * Timeline of ceratopsian research References * B. Brown. 1914.

The only known specimen was discovered in early Jurassic strata in Tsegi Canyon, Arizona, for which it was named. Segisaurus is the only dinosaur to have ever been excavated from the area. Description Restoration Segisaurus lived about 183 million years ago during the Jurassic period. It was a primitive bipedal theropod roughly around the size of a goose. Segisaurus was 1 meter (3.3 feet) long, half a meter (1.65 feet) tall and weighed about 4-7 kilograms. It was nimble and insectivorous, although it may have scavenged meat also. It was bird-like in structure, with a flexible, elongated neck and stout body. Segisaurus was three-toed and had powerful legs that were long compared to its body length. Like its legs, Segisaurus had a long tail and long forearms. Its collar bone was not unlike a bird's, thus strengthening scientists' arguments that dinosaurs were related to avians. Segisaurus is described from the only specimen ever found, the holotype UCMP 32101, which was a sub-adult. The full size of Segisaurus as an adult may never be known. Strangely, clavicles were found on the Segisaurus specimen, which were unknown in other dinosaurs from that era. A speculative interpretation by Charles Lewis Camp was that the \\"splint-like\\" neck ribs supported a Draco-like patagium along the neck, to improve the animal's ability to move quickly. Segisaurus is significant because it demonstrates that the clavicle was primitively present in early theropods.Chure, D. J., and Madsen, J. H., 1996, The furcula in Allosaurid Theropods and its implication for determining bird origins: Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, v. 16, supplement to n. 3, Abstracts of Papers, Fifty-sixth Annual Meeting, Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York, October 16‚Äì19, p. 28A. Classification Size comparison Segisaurus was described in 1936 by the paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp, based on specimen UCMP 32101, a fragmentary fossil skeleton which consisted of portions of the limbs, pelvis, and vertebrae. Cranial material was not recovered. Segisaurus went relatively ignored for the next half century. When the specimen was examined during this period, all who viewed it commented on the presence of clavicles and the apparently \\"solid\\" bones that the dinosaur had. Segisaurus appeared to be closely related to the better-known Coelophysis, but unlike the hollow bones of Coelophysis, Segisaurus had solid bones. This caused some scientists question whether Segisaurus was a theropod at all. In 2005, a re-examination of the Segisaurus holotype revealed that contrary to reports it did in fact have hollow bones.Carrano, M.T, Hutchinson, J.R, and Sampson, S.D. (2005). \\"New information on Segisaurus halli, a small theropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of Arizona.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 25(4): 835-849. In this study, Carano et al. found that although it was very unusual, Segisaurus was firmly a coelophysoid, and probably a close relative of Procompsognathus. = Distinguishing anatomical features= A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Rauhut (2003), Segisaurus can be distinguished based on the following features:Rauhut, O. W. M., 2003, The interrelationships and evolution of basal theropod dinosaurs: Special Papers in Palaeontology, v. 69, p. 1-213. * the dorsal centra are not very constricted ventrally * the scapula is slender * the humeral shaft has stronger torsion (~50 degrees) than does that of Coelophysis * the presence of a large ischial fenestra (according to Carrano et al., 2005)Carrano, M. T., Hutchinson, J. R., and Sampson, S. D., 2005 (published in 2006), New information on Segisaurus halli, a small theropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of Arizona: Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, v. 25, n. 4, p. 835-849. * the humeral deltopectoral crest is rectangular History of discovery Illustration of the holotype skeleton, shown as it was found In 1933, Max Littlesalt, a Navajo Indian, discovered Segisaurus in Tsegi Canyon of the Navajo Sandstone Formation, of Coconino County, Arizona. The specimen was found in calcareous sandstone, which was deposited during the Pliensbachian - Toarcian stages of the Jurassic, approximately 190 to 174 million years ago. After discovering the remains, Littlesalt, who kept livestock inside the canyon, pointed out the fossils to archeologists who were on an expedition inside the canyon. Other than the first finding of Segisaurus, no other specimens have been discovered. When the specimen of Segisaurus was discovered, Camp likened its posture to that of a \\"sitting hen\\", due to the position the dinosaur's remains were in.Camp, C. (1936). \\"A new type of small bipedal dinosaur from the Navajo sandstone of Arizona.\\" Univ. Calif. Publ., Bull. Dept. Geol. Sci., 24: 39-56. Other theropods used this positions to sleep or stay sheltered during sand and ash storms. Taphonomy The Segisaurus holotype was found in a bed of sandstone, suggesting that the dinosaur had been buried in a layer of sand and died. This is still only a hypothesis, as no nest or den materials were discovered with the specimen. Geological features of the Navajo Sandstone Formation suggest that this genus lived in an environment resembling modern sand dunes.

She was closely associated with the Red Clydeside movement in the early 20th century and especially for her role as the main organiser of the women of Govan who took part in the rent strikes of 1915.Audrey Canning, ‚ÄòBarbour , Mary (1875‚Äì1958)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 14 Feb 2014 Life Barbour was born on 20 February 1875 at 37 New Street, Kilbarchan to Jean Gavin and James Rough, a handloom carpet weaver. She was the third of seven children. Barbour attended school until she was fourteen years old. In 1887, the family moved to the village of Elderslie and she gained work as a thread twister, eventually becoming a carpet printer. On 28 August 1896, she married engineer David Barbour (2 May 1873 ‚Äì 13 November 1957) at Wallace Place, Elderslie. By the 1901 census, the couple had settled in Govan at 5 Macleod Street, where they lived with their son James.1901 Census (646/2 69/ 38) Retrieved 2018-03-21. By the 1911 census, the family, including another son, William, had moved to 43 Ure Street (now Uist Street).1911 Census (646/2 47/ 17) Retrieved 2018-03-07. In 1933 Barbour moved to a council house at 34 Cromdale Street in Drumoyne, Glasgow where she lived until her death.Glasgow Electoral Registers, 1857-1962. She died the year after husband David at the age of 83 in the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, and her funeral was held at Craigton Crematorium in Cardonald, near Govan. Political activism Barbour first became politically active after joining and becoming an active member of the Kinning Park Co-operative Guild. Her political activism began in earnest leading the South Govan Women's Housing Association during the Glasgow rent strikes of 1915, when she actively organised tenant committees and eviction resistance. The protestors became known as \\"Mrs Barbour's Army\\", and included Agnes Dollan, Helen Crawfurd, Mary Laird, and Mary Jeff. = Women's Peace Crusade = Barbour was a founder of the Women's Peace Crusade (WPC) at the \\"Great Women's Peace Conference\\" in June 1916, with Helen Crawfurd and Agnes Dollan. The WPC campaigned throughout June and July 1916 for a negotiated settlement to World War I. They did this predominately through open air meetings in Glasgow, Clydeside and Edinburgh. The possibility of a negotiated settlement became less likely with the formation of a new coalition government in December 1916, led by Lloyd George. Both the Russian Revolution and the Irish Easter Rising provided a catalyst for renewed peace activism in Scotland, including the work of the WPC. The 1917 annual May Day celebration in Glasgow Green brought together 70,000 people. Women peace activists, including Barbour, Dollan and Mary Burns Laird, were prominent among the speakers. This type of activity inspired the re-launch of the Women's Peace Crusade in July 1917. This took place on Glasgow Green and saw 10,000 people taking part. Other branches of the WPC were then established throughout Scotland, England and South Wales. Their campaign continued until the end of World War I. = Political career = Govan Fairfield election address In 1920, Barbour stood as the Labour candidate for Fairfield ward in Govan, and was elected to Glasgow Town Council, becoming the one of the city's first woman councillors. While Barbour has often been credited as being 'the first Labour woman councillor in Glasgow', this is not the case. Barbour was only one of a pioneering group of five women who were elected in 1920 which included Eleanor Stewart (Maryhill) as the other Labour woman councillor, and Jessica Baird-Smith, Mary Bell and Mary Anderson Snodgrass all respectively elected as Moderate councillors. It would appear that the misconception about Barbour being the \\"first Labour woman councillor\\" originated in Patrick Dollan's book about the Kinning Park Co-operative Society, published in 1923. While standing for election Barbour stated that \\"the advent of a woman candidate was seen by some men and women as outrageous\\", but contended that women councillors were needed to tackle issues that affected women and children. From 1924-27 Barbour served as one of Glasgow Corporation's first woman baillies, alongside Mary Bell. She was appointed as one of the first woman magistrates in Glasgow.. She was appointed as Justice of the Peace for the City of Glasgow in January 1928. = Role in provision of health and welfare services = From 1925, Barbour was Chairman of the Glasgow Women's Welfare and Advisory Clinic. She spoke at the opening, in August 1926, of the clinic in a store front at 51 Govan Road, which was the first site offering advice on birth control in Scotland. The clinic subsequently moved to 123 Montrose Street, Glasgow during 1932. In November 1926, Barbour attended the opening of the West Govan Child Welfare Clinic. This building, at 20 Arklet Street, Govan, remains in use by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde as Elderpark Clinic. During her tenure as a councillor and Bailie, she worked relentlessly on behalf of the working class people of her constituency, serving on numerous committees covering the provision of health and welfare services, and even after her retirement in 1931, she remained involved in this area. Influence and recognition =Mary Barbour in popular culture= Mary Barbour is namechecked in Scottish Women's Power Anthem 'Girl (Daughter of Scotland)' by Sharon Martin. Chris Hannan's play Elizabeth Gordon Quinn was first performed at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh on 29 June 1985. It was directed by Steven Unwin. The play is set during the rent strike in Glasgow, 1915. Although Barbour does not feature as a character, the play reproduces a famous Barbour incident from the rent-strike. The most important thing in the Quinn household is the piano. In Part One Scene Two, the piano is sequestrated by sheriff officers in lieu of owed rent. The Quinns, at this point, are not rent- strikers but are instead simply unable to pay their rent because of their poverty. In Part One, Scene Four William Quinn (Elizabeth's husband) narrates how he, aided by fifty women rent-strikers, and with the assistance of shipyard workers simply walked into the factor's office and asked for it to be returned. . Helen Crawfurd in her unpublished memoir recounts how during the rent-strike factors would try to collect the rental increases by resorting to the blackmail of social humiliation. The ploy was to dupe individual household tenants into believing that everyone else in the close had paid up. Upon one of these occasions Barbour drafted in men from Govan's shipyards, led them to the factor's office and demanded the amount of the increase be returned. 'Faced with thousands of black-faced workers the factor handed over the money' Crawfurd recalls. The song Mrs Barbour's Army by Alistair Hulett is about Mary Barbour's organisation of the 1915 rent strike.Nick Martin, \\"Interview with Alistair Hulett 1 April 2002\\" Mary Barbour was the subject of one of the Not Forgotten series of documentaries on Channel Four in 2007.Women on Red Clydeside In 2012 the BBC Radio 4 programme Woman's Hour ran a profile about Mary Barbour following the writing of a poem about her by Christine Finn for an exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland. The poem was called Mary Barbour's Rattle and can be viewed on the Museum's website. Mrs Barbour's Daughters is a play by A.J. Taudevin. It was first produced in October 2014 in Oran Mor, Glasgow in association with the Traverse Theatre. The play is set in a tenement flat in Govan where the lead character's memories come back to life in a series of flashbacks. The play is divided into eleven sections, and although Mrs Barbour is a recurring presence in the play, she only appears as a character in the penultimate section where she makes a speech set during the period of the rent strike. A review in The List concluded that \\"Mrs Barbour's Daughters is a concise and moving sketch of the feminist tradition and makes its point using sweet harmony, not rabble rousing.\\" The original cast included; Mary-Anna Hepburn played Grace, Gail Watson played Joan and Libby McArthur Mrs Barbour. The director was Emma Callander assisted by Andy McNamee. Mary Barbour was also the inspiration behind the character of Agnes Calder in J David Simons' novel The Liberation of Celia Kahn (Five Leaves 2011, re-printed Saraband 2014). Also featured in the novel are the Glasgow women's involvement in the Rent Strikes and the events leading up to the foundation of the first birth control clinic in Govan, Glasgow.https://historicalnovelsociety.org/reviews/the-liberation-of-celia- kahn/ = Statue = Statue to commemorate Mary Barbour, Govan Cross, Glasgow.View from the front. In 2011, Glasgow Women's Library commissioned 21 artworks as part of their 21st anniversary celebrations. Glasgow-based artist Sharon Thomas chose to depict a hypothetical monument to Barbour in Govan. The work generated interest in a real statue of Barbour, which in 2013 led to the creation of the Remember Mary Barbour Association, who campaigned for a statue. The campaign garnered support from Glasgow City Council, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Parliament and Alex Ferguson. In September 2015 five sculptors were shortlisted to produce a maquette to convey their vision of a fitting statue. Public showings of the set of five maquettes were scheduled to take place from November 2015 through February 2016, at various locations commencing at the Pearce Institute in Govan. Sculptor Andrew Brown was selected to sculpt the statue in February 2016. Although having secured about ¬£56,000 through public donations, approximately half of the funding needed to build the statue, the RMBA's application to Creative Scotland was rejected in November 2015 based on an apparent lack of community engagement. In order to meet the shortfall and raise the money to complete the project, the RMBA planned several events including a gala concert to be held in the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow. The statue was completed in 2017 and unveiled in March 2018.

The Council estimated the cost of the cairn to be ¬£6,000 which was funded from the Renfrewshire Citizens Fund following a recommendation from the council‚Äôs Johnstone and the Villages Local Area Committee. The cairn was installed in New St, where Barbour was born, and was unveiled on 21 November 2015 by the Provost of Renfrewshire, Anne Hall, in the presence of Barbour's descendants. Renfrewshire Council also agreed to establish and fund a Mary Barbour Prize to be awarded annually to a school pupil at Kilbarchan Primary School.

The comics have spawned a series of children's novels from Random House. The story has been described as a cross between The Wizard of Oz and Star Wars, centering on the adventures of Akiko, a Japanese American girl, on and around the planet Smoo accompanied by extraterrestrials Mr. Beeba, Spuckler, Gax, and Poog. Akiko was created while Crilley was teaching English in Japan in December 1992.biography.jrank.org, \\"Mark Crilley (1966-) - Sidelights\\" It was inspired by Japanese anime and manga and classic American comics such as Little Nemo and Calvin and Hobbes. Upon publication in the US it did not become mainstream, but gained an audience nonetheless. Crilley describes his work as safe for children but written for adults. Akiko has been nominated in the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards over a dozen times since 1995. In 1998, Mark Crilley and Akiko were nominated for Best Serialized Story, Best Continuing Series, Best Title for Younger Readers, and Best Cover Artist.  Characters in the series  =Protagonist= * Akiko: a Japanese-American girl initially reluctant to distinguish herself, but gradually becomes heroic. =Supporting characters= * Mr. Beeba: a pedantic polymath and librarian who often quarrels with Spuckler. * Spuckler Boach: a self-appointed adventurer and part-time mechanic, who often quarrels with Mr. Beeba. * Gax: a ramshackle robot belonging to Spuckler, equipped with artificial intelligence and a variety of tools. * Poog: an airborne, bodiless head, capable of psychokinesis and occasional telepathy. Production Akiko on the Planet Smoo, the first comic in the series, was published in December 1995. Since then, 52 issues of the comic have been published. The story in which Akiko rescues a captive prince (in the first eighteen issues) was originally a reversal of the traditional fairy tale's gender roles, but Crilley said that, later, \\"...the whole Prince- rescuing plot became little more than a pretext for a long and obstacle-packed journey. I wanted Akiko to start out as quite weak, but have her acquire strength over time.\\" When Crilley originally shopped his comic around, Sirius Entertainment believed it could work as an adult series, despite its child- safe tone. Crilley later expressed some surprise at Akiko's relative success. \\"The people in the comics world expect grittiness, a certain amount of violence, certainly a lot of bang for their buck, and it's kind of a surprise that it has been so warmly embraced by the critical establishment,\\" he stated. Despite much of the comic having been partially inspired by children's stories such as The Wizard of Oz, he believes that the dialogue strikes a chord in both adults and children, as with the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. At the suggestion of his fans, Crilley created a series of issues which takes place on Earth. He had Akiko's friends from Smoo crash land in rural Japan, and he thus hoped to possibly enlighten some readers about Japanese culture. The last issue of Akiko came was published in March 2002. On Mark Crilley's blog, he stated that the comic has gone out of production. He continued to write novels in the Akiko book series, with the tenth and final novel released in 2008. He has recently created a new book series about extraterrestrials, Billy Clikk, and a manga series, Miki Falls. Children's book series The first four books borrow their storylines from the comics (detailing Akiko and her team's quest to rescue Prince Froptoppit from the sorceress Alia Rellapor), while the others introduce original plot lines. In Akiko: The Training Master, Akiko is somewhat older and drawn to resemble a teenager rather than a child. Some reviewers referred to the books as a fun adventures appropriate for younger readers, with some describing them as being free of gender and racial bias. =Plot= The first book, Akiko on the Planet Smoo, begins when 10-year-old name Akiko is removed from Earth and brought to Planet Smoo because its King Froptoppitt believes she can save his son. There, Akiko is introduced to her fellow questers (Mr. Beeba, Poog, Spuckler Boach, and Gax). The next three books depict a series of adventures, arguments, mishaps, and exotic alien places, creatures, characters, and food, until they reach Alia Rellapor's castle. The next three books contain further adventures (Akiko and the Alpha Centauri 5000 centered on Spuckler while Akiko and the Journey to Toog focuses on Poog's backstory) but Akiko always begins and ends the novel on Earth. In Akiko: The Training Master, set some years later, Akiko and her friends attend a special academy to become official guardians of the Planet Smoo.

He is especially known for his studies of republicanism in the early modern period (mostly in Europe, Britain, and America), his work on the history of English common law, his treatment of Edward Gibbon and other Enlightenment historians, and, in historical method, for his contributions to the history of political discourse. Born in England, Pocock spent most of his early life in New Zealand. He moved to the United States in 1966, where since 1975 he has been a tenured professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Early life and career Pocock was born in London on 7 March 1924, but in 1927 moved with his family to New Zealand where his father, Greville Pocock, was appointed professor of Classics at Canterbury College. He later moved to Cambridge, earning his PhD in 1952 under the tutelage of Herbert Butterfield. He returned to New Zealand to teach at Canterbury University College from 1946 to 1948, and to lecture at the University of Otago from 1953 to 1955. In 1959, he established and chaired the Department of Political Science at the University of Canterbury. He moved to the US in 1966, where he was given the title of William Eliot Smith professor of history at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1975 Pocock assumed his present position at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore; he holds the position of the Harry C. Black Emeritus Professor of History. His first book, entitled The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law examined the workings and origins of common law mind, showing how thinkers such as the English jurist Edward Coke (1552‚Äì1634) built up a historical analysis of British history into an epistemology of law and politics; and how that edifice later came to be subverted by scholars of the middle to late seventeenth century. Some of this work has since been revised.Glenn Burgess, The Politics of the Ancient Constitution: an introduction to English political thought, 1603‚Äì1642. (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993). Later work By the 1970s Pocock had changed his focus from how lawyers understood the evolution of law to how philosophers and theologians did. The Machiavellian Moment (1975), his widely acclaimed magnum opus, showed how Florentines, Englishmen, and Americans had responded to and analysed the destruction of their states and political orders in a succession of crises sweeping through the early modern world. Again, not all historians accept Pocock's account, but leading scholars of early modern republicanism show its influence ‚Äì especially in their characterisation of political theorist James Harrington (1611‚Äì1677) as a salient historical actor.Among several, see Jonathan Scott, Commonwealth Principles: Republican writing of the English revolution (Cambridge: 2004); Eric M.

Subsequent research by Pocock explores the literary world inhabited by the British historian Edward Gibbon (1737‚Äì1794), and how Gibbon understood the cataclysm of decline and fall within the Roman Empire as an inevitable conflict between ancient virtue and modern commerce. Gibbon, it turns out, evinces all the hallmarks of a bona fide civic humanist,Pocock, \\"Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian,\\" Daedulus 105:3 (1976), 153‚Äì69. even while composing his great \\"enlightened narrative\\".Barbarism and Religion vol. 1: The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737‚Äì1764 (Cambridge: 1999), 123, 303‚Äì04. The first two volumes of Pocock's projected six-volume series on Gibbon, Barbarism and Religion, won the American Philosophical Society's Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History for the year 1999. The Cambridge School Pocock is celebrated not merely as an historian, but as a pioneer of a new type of historical methodology: contextualism, i.e., the study of \\"texts in context\\". In the 1960s and early '70s, he, (introducing \\"languages\\" of political thought) along with Quentin Skinner (focusing on authorial intention), and John Dunn (stressing biography), united informally to undertake this approach as the \\"Cambridge School\\" of the history of political thought. Pocock details its genesis, credited to Peter Laslett, in \\"Present at the Creation: With Laslett to the Lost Worlds\\", International Journal of Public Affairs 2 (2006), 7‚Äì17. Laslett's 1949 edition of Sir Robert Filmer's works amounts to \\"the true beginning of the study of political writings by assigning them to their proper contexts\\". Laslett implemented \\"temporal\\" contexts; Pocock highlighted \\"linguistic\\" contexts, \\"each existing side by side and perhaps interacting with others, while remaining distinct and having a history of its own\\". Eventually, and for his own purposes, Pocock preferred history of political 'discourse' to that of political 'thought', wishing to widen and refine the field into the study of \\"...speech, literature, and public utterance in general, involving an element of theory and carried on in a variety of contexts with which it can be connected in a variety of ways.\\" see Pocock, \\"What is Intellectual History?\\", in What is History Today? (London: MacMillan Press, Ltd., 1988), 114. Hereafter for the Cambridge School and its adherents, the then-reigning method of textual study, that of engaging a vaunted 'canon' of previously pronounced \\"major\\" political works in a typically anachronistic and disjointed fashion, simply would not do. Pocock's \\"political languages\\" is the indispensable keystone of this historical revision. Defined as \\"idioms, rhetorics, specialised vocabularies and grammars\\" considered as \\"a single though multiplex community of discourse\\",Pocock, \\"The Concept of a Language and the m√©tier d'historien: some considerations on practice,\\" in The Languages of Political Theory in Early- modern Europe, ed. Anthony Pagden (Cambridge: 1987), 21‚Äì25; and, of an earlier vintage, see also essays nos. 1, 3, 4 in Politics, Language and Time. For a wide-ranging summary of developments that have, in one scholar's view, transformed the Cambridge School into \\"an intergenerational enterprise\\", see the review article, B.W. Young, \\"Enlightenment Political Thought and the Cambridge School,\\" Historical Journal 52:1 (2009), 235‚Äì51. languages are uncovered (or discovered) in texts by historians who subsequently \\"learn\\" them in due course. The resultant familiarity produces a knowledge of how political thought can be stated in historically discovered \\"linguistic universes\\", and in exactly what manner all or parts of a text can be expressed.Pocock's method originally incorporated a theory of \\"traditions\\", combined with elements of Thomas Kuhn's \\"paradigms\\" (see Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, [Chicago: 3rd ed., 1996]), but Pocock has since explained that \\"a political community is not simply a community of enquiry, and that therefore the status and function of [political] paradigms\\" differs from Kuhn's depiction of scientific investigation. see \\"Preface, 1989,\\" in Politics, Language, and Time. As examples, Pocock has cited the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century political languages of the \\"common law\\", \\"civil jurisprudence\\" and \\"classical republicanism\\", through which political writers such as James Harrington, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke reached their rhetorical goals. In a new article in January 2019, Pocock answered parts of the criticism against the contextualism of the \\"Cambridge School\\": \\"The beginnings of the ‚Äòglobal‚Äô critique are well known and may as well be accepted as common ground. They reduce to the assertion that ‚ÄòCambridge‚Äô scholarship in this field is ‚ÄòEurocentric‚Äô [...] This is obviously true, and calls for reformation.\\" British history From 1975, Pocock began advocating the development of a new subject which he called \\"British History\\" (also labelled \\"New British History\\", a title that Pocock has expressed his wish to shake off).Pocock, \\"Contingency, identity, sovereignty\\" in Uniting the Kingdom?, eds. Alexander Grant, Keith John Stringer (Routledge, 1995). Pocock coined the term Atlantic archipelago as a replacement for British Isles: \\"We should start with what I have called the Atlantic archipelagosince the term \\"British Isles\\" is one which Irishmen reject and Englishmen decline to take quite seriously\\".Pocock, \\"British History: A plea for a new subject,\\" Journal of Modern History 47,4(December 1975), 601‚Äì28. \\"We should start,\\" he continues, \\"with what I have called the Atlantic archipelago ‚Äì since the term \\"British Isles\\" is one which Irishmen reject and Englishmen decline to take quite seriously. This is a large ‚Äì dare I say a sub-subcontinental? ‚Äì island group lying off the northwestern coast of geographic Europe, partly within and partly without the oceanic limits of the roman empire and of what is usually called \\"Europe\\" in the sense of the latter's successor states; in which respect it somewhat resembles Scandinavia.\\" He also pressed his fellow historians to reconsider two issues linked to the future of British history. First, he urged historians of the British Isles to move away from histories of the Three Kingdoms (Scotland, Ireland, England) as separate entities,Pocock, The Discovery of Islands, 77‚Äì93. and he called for studies implementing a bringing-together or conflation of the national narratives into truly integrated enterprises. It has since become the commonplace preference of historians to treat British history in just that fashion.Pocock, \\"British History: a Plea for a New Subject,\\" 24‚Äì43; \\"The Field Enlarged: an Introduction,\\" 47‚Äì57; and \\"The Politics of the New British History,\\" 289‚Äì300. All are reprinted in The Discovery of Islands. See also \\"The Limits and Divisions of British History: in Search of the Unknown Subject,\\" American Historical Review 87:2 (Apr. 1982), 311‚Äì36; \\"The New British History in Atlantic Perspective: an Antipodean Commentary,\\" American Historical Review 104:2 (Apr. 1999), 490‚Äì500. Second, he prodded policymakers to reconsider the Europeanisation of the UK still underway, via its entry into the European Union. In its abandonment of a major portion of national sovereignty purely from economic motives, that decision threw into question the entire matter of British sovereignty itself. What, Pocock asks, will (and must) nations look like if the capacity for and exercise of national self-determination is put up for sale to the highest bidder?\\"History and Sovereignty: the Historiographical Response to Europeanization in Two British Cultures,\\" Journal of British Studies 31 (Oct. 1992), 358‚Äì89. And more lately, in which Pocock speculates that the European Union might devolve into an \\"empire of the market\\", see \\"Deconstructing Europe,\\" in Discovery of Islands, 269‚Äì88, at 281. New Zealand Alongside his ongoing work on Gibbon, has come a renewed attention to his nation of citizenship, New Zealand. In a progression of essays published since 1991, Pocock explored the historical mandates and implications of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi (between the British Crown and the indigenous MƒÅori people) for MƒÅori and the descendants of the original 19th-century European (but mainly British) settlers, known as PƒÅkehƒÅ. Both parties have legitimate claims to portions of their national sovereignty. Pocock concludes that the issue of New Zealand's sovereignty must be an ongoing shared experience, a perpetual debate leading to several ad hoc agreements if necessary, to which the MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ need to accustom themselves permanently. The alternative, an eventual rebirth of the violence and bloodshed of the 19th century New Zealand Wars, cannot and must not be entertained. In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Pocock was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the history of political thought.

The type species, It currently contains two species. A. remotus is known from a partial skull and three foot bones recovered from the Mongolian Nemegt Formation, which was deposited in a humid floodplain about 70 million years ago. These remains were named and described by Soviet paleontologist Sergei Kurzanov in 1976. A second species, A. altai, known from a much more complete skeleton, was named and described by Stephen L. Brusatte and colleagues in 2009. Its relationships to other tyrannosaurid genera are unclear, with some evidence supporting a hypothesis that Alioramus is closely related to the contemporary species Tarbosaurus bataar. Alioramus were bipedal like all known theropods, and their sharp teeth indicate that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus is characterized by a row of five bony crests along the top of the snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than most other tyrannosaurids. History of discovery The holotype (PIN 3141/1) of Alioramus is a partial skull associated with three metatarsals. A joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert in the early 1970s found these remains at a locality known as Nogon-Tsav in the Mongolian province of Bayankhongor, Nemegt Formation. Alioramus was named and described by Russian paleontologist Sergei Kurzanov in 1976. Its crests and low skull profile looked so different from other tyrannosaurids that Kurzanov believed his find was far removed from other members of the family. Accordingly, he gave it the generic name Alioramus, derived from the Latin alius ('other') and ramus ('branch'), and the specific name A. remotus, which means 'removed' in Latin. A second species, A. altai, was discovered back in 2001 at the Tsagan Khushu locality also from the Nemegt Formation. However, several faunal differences may suggest that the respective locations of A. remotus and A. altai differ in age. The holotype IGM 100/1844 is a partial skeleton that includes a very complete skull‚Äîmore so than A. remotus‚Äîwith partial vertebrae, pelvic girdle and hindlimbs. The name for this species, altai, is in reference to the Altai Mountains.  Description  Size of A. remotus compared with a human Skull of A. altai at Wyoming Dinosaur Center, Thermopolis Alioramus remotus was estimated at in length when originally described by Sergei Kurzanov in 1976. In 1988 Paul gave a similar length of and a weight of . In 2016 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi estimated A. remotus at and , and A. altai at and . Kurzanov, however, did not correct for lengthening of the skull by deformation during fossilization, which may indicate a shorter overall body length for this individual. If this specimen is a juvenile, then adult Alioramus would have reached greater lengths, but no confirmed adult specimens are known. The skull of A. remotus was approximately long. In general, it is long and low, a shape typical of more basal tyrannosauroids and juveniles of larger tyrannosaurids. The premaxillary bones at the tip of the snout in Alioramus remotus have not been found, but are taller than wide in all tyrannosauroids for which they are known. The nasal bones are fused and ornamented with a row of five irregular bony crests that protrude upwards from the midline, where the nasal bones are sutured together. These crests all measure more than tall. Life restoration of A. remotus At the back of the skull there is a protrusion, called the nuchal crest, arising from the fused parietal bones, a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids. In Alioramus, the nuchal crest is greatly thickened, similarly to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Like the rest of the skull, the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender, another possible juvenile characteristic. As in Tarbosaurus, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, locking the two bones together and removing much of the flexibility seen in other tyrannosaurids. Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth, D-shaped in cross section, on each side. Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla, and 18 in each dentary, Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth, more than any other tyrannosaurid. The braincase of A. altai was intermediate between the basal theropod and avialan conditions. The rest of the skeleton of Alioramus remotus is completely unknown except for three metatarsals (bones of the upper foot), but the discovery of A. altai, which is known from substantially more complete remains, has shed light on the anatomy of the genus.  Classification and systematics  Paleontologists have long classified Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were for many years poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The description of A. altai in 2009 confirmed the placement of the genus within the Tyrannosaurinae. A. remotus skull diagram, known portions in white Endocranial cast of Alioramus altai Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, including a locking mechanism in the lower jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and might even have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which lived in the same time and place. The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. altai. Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults. Recently a cladogram has been published finding Alioramus just outside Tyrannosauridae. Below is the cladogram by Loewen (2013).  Paleoecology  Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; Alioramus has been collected in area A (left) The Beds of Nogon-Tsav are considered to be the same age as the Nemegt Formation. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, at the end of the Late Cretaceous. The Maastrichtian stage in Mongolia, as preserved in the Nemegt Formation and at Nogon-Tsav, was characterized by a wetter and more humid climate compared with the semi-arid environment preserved in the earlier, underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations. Nemegt sediments preserve floodplains, large river channels and soil deposits, but caliche deposits indicate periodic droughts. This environment supported a more diverse and generally larger dinosaur fauna than in earlier times. Kurzanov reported that other theropods, including Tarbosaurus, ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs were discovered at the same locality, but these remains have never been reported in detail. If the Nogon Tsav fauna was similar to that of the Nemegt Formation, troodontid theropods, as well as pachycephalosaurs, ankylosaurids and hadrosaurs would also have been present. Titanosaurian sauropods were also potential prey for predators in the Nemegt.

It lies in one of the most remote forest areas of the country and covers . The park is divided into three sectors, straddling the states of Nord Kivu, Province Orientale and Maniema. Three of the country's spectacular endemic animals occur here: the Grauer's gorilla, the okapi, and the Congo peafowl. Maiko is also an important site for the conservation of the African forest elephant, eastern chimpanzee and the endemic aquatic genet.  Creation In 1949, the Belgian colonial administration created the Bakumu Hunting Reserve (Bakumu, meaning \\"The Kumus\\", the native tribe in the region) on an area that would later encompass the boundaries of the Park as we know it today. The original plans for the area is believed to have aimed at preventing the exploitation of mineral resources rather the protection of the nature and the wildlife. On November 20 of 1970, the Presidential Decree no 70-312 which is bound to the law that had created the ICCN previous year, was signed into force by Joseph D√©sir√© Mobutu. This document asserted the Maiko National Park to be a full-fledged nature protection area.  The rebel problem  The roadless and inaccessible nature of the region made it ideal for some Simba rebels to retreat after their defeat in 1964. Ever since, they have been making a meager living by poaching on wildlife and controlling illegal mining activities inside of Maiko. The presence of the Simba also stems from the inability of the governing bodies to follow the compensatory measures required by the decree of 1970. This precarious security situation have made it difficult for the rangers to patrol the Park, especially after the ICCN was coerced by the Congolese army into guiding their attacks towards the Simba. Moreover, conservation work has also been hampered by the presence of rebels, culminating in capture and detainment of several survey crews between 2003 and 2005. At least three other rebels groups are known to be active in different parts of the park, among which the Rwandan Interahamwe in the east. Put together, these menaces leave absolutely no control over the park area by the ICCN.  International conservation efforts  The first thorough exploration of the Maiko dates back to 1989, when the Wildlife Conservation Society, backed by the ICCN (then ZICN) and supported by the World Bank, the European Community and the WWF, moved into the area and surveyed about 950 km of transect.Hart, J.A., and Sikubwabo, C., (1994).

All observations point out to the intense hunting pressure caused by miners and the widespread use of guns as serious threats to the remaining animal populations. A new approach to conservation has been the implementation of compensation measures for Simbas willing to leave the Park. In 2010, FFI initiated the construction of health centers and schools in villages falling inside the zone of influence of the Simbas. The same year FZS launched an ambitious project aiming at turning the Simbas problem around by recruiting some of them as park rangers and allowing a de facto social reintegration which would directly benefit nature conservation in Maiko.

It is Africa's largest tropical rainforest reserve covering about 36,000 km2 or . It extends into the provinces of Mai Ndombe, Equateur, Kasa√Ø and Sankuru. Geography The park is in an area of pristine rainforest about halfway between Kinshasa, the capital, and Kisangani. There are no roads and most of the park is accessible only by river. CTT (www.congotravelandtours.com) is the only operator and logistics company currently organizing overwater transport from the Congo River into the Salonga Park via minor rivers. The southern region inhabited by the Iyaelima people is accessible via the Lokoro River, which flows through the center and northern parts of the park, and the Lula River in the south. History The Salonga National Park was established as the Tshuapa National Park in 1956, and gained its present boundaries with a 1970 presidential decree by President Mobutu Sese Seko. It was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. Due to the civil war in the eastern half of the country, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1999. The park is co-managed by the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature and the World Wide Fund for Nature since 2015. Extensive consultation is ongoing,CERDI-BAS (2016), Etude Strat√©gique des populations r√©sidentes dans le parc national de la Salonga with the two main populations living within the park; the Iyaelima, the last remaining residents of the park and the Kitawalistes, a religious sect who installed them-self in the park just after its creation. An intense collaboration exists between the park guards and the Iyaelima, as Iyaelima villages are used as guard posts. It is known that bonobo densities are highest around Iyaelima villages which shows that they cause no threat to the park's emblematic species. Animals Within the Park Animals in the park include bonobos, Dryas monkeys, Thollon's red colobus, Congo peafowl, leopards, forest elephants, and African slender-snouted crocodiles. Other animals present include the long-tailed pangolin, giant pangolin, tree pangolin, Angolan slender mongoose, aquatic genet, hippopotamus, the African golden cat, bushpig, bongo, yellow-backed duiker, sitatunga, okapi, bushbuck, water chevrotain and forest buffalo. There are many birds present and some of the larger ones are the cattle egret, black stork and yellow-billed stork. Some of its species are endemic to the country, and many are of high conservation concern. The southern region has been the location for studies of bonobos in the wild. There are much higher populations of bonobos near the Iyaelima settlements than elsewhere in the park, apparently because the Iyaelima do not harm them and are playing a strong role in their conservation.

Tracing the history of the Hurling Championship back to its beginning, it is possible to easily pick out periods when specific teams or counties dominated the competition, only to find themselves rapidly superseded by another dominant team or teams. The format of the championship had also undergone several significant changes throughout the years, with the creation of the 'back-door system' in 1997. 1887 to 1888 - The first championship and the \\"invasion\\" Michael Cusack; founder of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The format of the very first hurling championship was unique in that it was the only open draw All-Ireland championship ever-played. The five participating teams were paired off against each other regardless of their provincial locations. Three teams - Galway, Kilkenny and Wexford - advanced directly to the semi-final stages of the competition, while Clare and Tipperary met in a lone 'quarter-final.' Disputes in Cork and Limerick as to what club should represent the respective counties led to neither county participating. Meelick captain, Pat Madden, in the 1887 All Ireland Final against Thurles. The inaugural All-Ireland senior hurling final was played on Easter Sunday 1888 in Birr, County Offaly. Tipperary and Galway were the opponents, with both sides vigorously contesting the game from start to finish. Early in the game one of the Thurles players received facial injuries when he fell on his hurley and had to retire from the game. In a sporting gesture of unrivalled magnitude Galway representatives Meelick withdrew one of their own players to level the teams. Thurles, the Tipp representatives, scored a point after eleven minutes and led by that score at half-time. With no number of points equaling a goal in those days the destination of the very first All-Ireland hurling title was wide open. At a crucial stage in the second-half, Jim Stapleton lead a charge down the field. The Thurles captain spotted an opening and passed the ball to Tom Healy. Healy made no mistake in sending a low, hard drive to the back of the Galway net. The game ended shortly afterwards with Tipperary winning on a score line of 1 goal, 1 point and 1 forfeit point to Galway's no score. The second ever championship in 1888 remains unfinished due to the so-called 'invasion' tour of the United States, which saw the infant GAA's organisational staff and 48 players go on a promotional tour of the United States. The tour was a failure and the All-Ireland was left unfinished with Kilkenny, Cork and Clare left in the tournament. Seventeen of the 'invaders' never returned to Ireland. 1889 to 1891 - The championship gathers momentum In 1889 Clare won the very first Munster final before taking on Dublin in the All-Ireland final. The Clare men, who played in their bare feet, took a 1‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì0 lead at the interval in atrocious weather conditions. W.J. Spain scored three goals for the metropolitans in the second half as Clare were held to a point. the 5‚Äì1 to 1‚Äì6 score line gave Dublin their first All-Ireland title and meant that goal- scoring hero Spain became the first dual All-Ireland winner as he won an All- Ireland football medal with Limerick in 1887. In 1890 Cork and Wexford did battle in the All-Ireland final. The game was a controversial one and was marred by ill-tempered behaviour. A Cork player had his toe broken by one of his Wexford counterparts. Cork captain Dan Lane walked his men off the field in protest. At the time Cork were trailing by 2‚Äì2 to 1‚Äì6; however, the GAA's Central Council later backed Cork and the team were awarded the All-Ireland title. The 1891 championship saw the novelty of Kerry contesting the All- Ireland final with Wexford. The game itself was the second game of a triple- header played at Clonturk Park on 28 February 1892. The first game that day was the All-Ireland football semi-final between Dublin and Cavan. This was followed by the All-Ireland furling final and the programme of games finished with the All-Ireland football final between Cork and the winners of the first game. The hurling decider was an exciting affair with the Kerry team playing in their bare feet in grey jumpers with a gold band. Paddy 'Carr' Carroll scored Kerry's first point after five minutes with the team's second score coming after another twenty minutes. At half-time Kerry led by 0‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì1. The game, however, was not without controversy. At full-time the referee said that the score was 1-1 apiece and that extra-time was necessary. The Kerry team were reluctant to play the extra thirty minutes with captain John Mahony one of the most vocal opponents. It was only after being persuaded by the chairman of the Kerry County Board that the team decided to line out for a third half hour of hurling. Both sides upped their games considerably for the only occasion that extra time was played in an All-Ireland final. Kerry went on to win the game by 2‚Äì3 to 1‚Äì5 to capture their first and only All-Ireland hurling title. 1892 to 1894 - Cork's first three-in-a-row 1892 saw Cork begin a three-year dominance of the championship. That year's All-Ireland final saw 'the Rebels' take on Dublin for the first time. The game turned into a controversial one as referee Dan Fraher changed his mind after initially awarding a goal to Cork. He eventually decided that the GAA's Central Council should decide the matter. Dublin, however, had walked off the field as some of the players had to return to work and, because of this, Cork were awarded the title. Cork qualified for a third All-Ireland final in three seasons in 1893 and, they proved again that they were the hurling masters. The championship decider pitted Cork against Kilkenny. It was the very first meeting of these two great rivals in the history of the championship. The game was fixed for Ashtown; however, upon arrival both teams refused to play there as somebody had neglected to have the grass cut. After a long delay the goalposts were uprooted and both teams and their supporters headed to the Phoenix Park where the game took place after some delay. The game itself turned into a rout as Cork scored a huge tally of 6‚Äì8 to Kilkenny's 0‚Äì2. It was Cork's second All- Ireland title in-a-row. The 1894 championship saw Cork retain their provincial title for the third consecutive occasion. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Dublin for the second time in three years. Cork showed their class and the game turned into a rout. A 5‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì0 score line gave another victory to Cork. The 29 point defeat of ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô marks the game out as one of the most one-sided All-Ireland finals in history. It was a record- making third All-Ireland title in-a-row for Cork. 1895 to 1900 - Tipperary's five out of six Had it not been for a slip up in 1897, it is not beyond the bounds of reality to surmise that Tipperary could have won a remarkable six All-Ireland titles in succession. In 1895 the Tipp team stormed to the provincial title and into the All-Ireland final where Kilkenny were the opponents in the first championship decider to be played at what is now Croke Park. Tipp took a commanding 1‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì0 lead at half-time and went on to hammer \\"the Cats\\" by 6‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì10 at the final whistle. Tipperary's Paddy Riordan is said to have scored all but one point of his team's total. Tipperary were the masters of the hurling world again in 1896. After securing a second consecutive Munster title the team lined out against Dublin in the All-Ireland final. Tipp scored a goal in the very first minute and took a remarkable 4‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì1 lead at half-time. The game turned into a rout as Tipperary won easily by 8‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì4. This game still holds the record as the most one-sided All-Ireland final of all-time. Tipperary surrendered their provincial crown to Limerick in 1897, who later faced Kilkenny in the All- Ireland final. Both sides were hoping to win the All-Ireland title for the first time. \\"The Cats\\" got off to a great start and led by 2‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì1 at half- time. Limerick, however, powered on in the second half and used their new technique of hooking. They got two quick goals early in the half and scored the winning goal from a free after fifty-two minutes. At the final whistle Limerick emerged victorious by 3‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì4. It was Limerick's first All-Ireland title. Tipperary reclaimed the provincial title in 1898 and qualified for an All-Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. In a high-scoring and exciting game Kilkenny were on top for the first twenty-five minutes. In the second-half Tipp took the upper-hand with captain Mikey Maher scoring three goals. A huge 7‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì10 score line gave Tipp the victory. After retaining the provincial title in 1899 Tipperary subsequently advanced to the All-Ireland final where Wexford provided the opposition. Wexford held Tipp for the first fifteen minutes; however, the Munster men still took a 2‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì3 lead at half-time. Tipp went on the rampage in the second half and finished with a score of 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì4. The Wexford team walked off the field with ten minutes left in the game because they couldn't find a substitute for an injured player. Tipp were awarded the title. In 1900 Tipperary trounced Kerry, Kilkenny and Galway to book a place in the All-Ireland final. A new innovation was introduced this year as London were permitted to take on the winners of the so-called 'home' final to decide the resting place of the All-Ireland title. This game was a close affair with both sides level at 0‚Äì5 with eight minutes to go. London then took the lead; however, they later conceded a free. Captain Mikey Maher stepped up, took the free and a forward ‚Äòcharge‚Äô carried the sliotar over the line. Tipp scored another goal following a weak puck out and claimed the victory. It was Maher's fifth and final All-Ireland title by 2‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì6. It was a remarkable fifth All-Ireland title in six years. 1901 to 1903 - The Exiles and the Rebels do battle After a number of seasons out of the limelight Cork bounced back by capturing the Munster title in 1901. 'The Rebels' subsequently defeated Galway and Wexford to set up an All-Ireland final meeting with London. Cork were the overwhelming favourites against a team of exiles which was made up of nine Cork men. A downpour made the underfoot conditions difficult as London settled better and Cork floundered. A goal for London with ten minutes left in the game sealed Cork's fate and London by 1‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì4. It was the first time that the All-Ireland cup went overseas. The Cork-London rematch took place in 1902, following Cork's victory over Dublin in the 'home' final. The game was played in Cork to mark the opening of the new Cork Athletic Grounds. After defeat in 1901 the Cork side made no mistake on this occasion and powered to a 3‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì0 victory. It was a huge triumph for Cork. In 1903 Cork defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland 'home' final before doing battle with London for the third year in succession. Cork were well on top for the entire game and secured a merited 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì1 victory. 1904 to 1913 ‚Äì Kilkenny‚Äôs greatest era 1904 saw Kilkenny begin a hugely successful era as Cork were heading into decline. Both sides met in the final and 'the Cats' won the game thanks to Dick Doyle‚Äôs first-half goal, while Pat 'Fox' Maher made a great save at the end to help his team to a 1-9 to 1-8 victory. It was Kilkenny's very first All-Ireland title from five appearances in the championship decider. In 1905, Kilkenny and Cork had another All-Ireland final showdown; a high-scoring match with Cork winning by 5-10 to 3-13. The game, however, had to be replayed as Cork goalkeeper Daniel McCarthy was a British army reservist and Kilkenny‚Äôs Matt Gargan had played with Waterford in the Munster championship. The game was another high-scoring one, with Jimmy Kelly scoring 5-2. A puck-out by Cork's Jamesy Kelleher is said to have hopped over the Kilkenny crossbar. Kilkenny won the game by 7-7 to 2-9, with all seven of their goals coming in a thirty-minute spell. It was Kilkenny's second All-Ireland title in succession. In 1906 Tipperary played Dublin in the All-Ireland final for the first time in a decade. The game is notable for the quickest goal ever scored in a championship decider. Dublin‚Äôs Bill Leonard snatched a goal after just five seconds. This good start did not deter Tipperary, who won the game by 3-16 to 3-8. Ironically, eleven of the Dublin team hailed from Tipperary 1907 saw Kilkenny contest their third final in four years and, for the third time, it was Cork who provided the opposition. In one of the all-time great finals a high-scoring game was the order of the day. Jimmy Kelly scored a hat trick for ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô with Jack Anthony scoring the winning point with minutes left in the match. Cork went on two goal hunts immediately; however, a 3‚Äì12 to 4‚Äì8 victory gave Kilkenny a narrow one-point victory. In 1908 Kilkenny were unable to defend their title as they withdrew from the championship due to a disagreement over custody of the Railway Shield. Because of this Dublin emerged from Leinster while Tipperary were the Munster champions. The All-Ireland final between these two sides was an exciting affair. Tipp were leading by 2‚Äì5 to 0-8 coming into the last passage of play when Harry Boland and Bill Leonard combined to score the equalizer. The replay took place in Athy; however, Tipperary were much too strong on the second meeting. Hugh Shelly and Tony Carew scored three goals between them to set Tipp on the way to a 3‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì5 victory. In 1909 Kilkenny contested the championship after the difficulties of the previous year and reached the final again. Tipperary provided the opposition and went into the game with the distinction of never losing an All-Ireland final. An exciting game developed; however, it was Kilkenny's ability to get goals that proved the deciding factor. An opening goal by Jimmy Kelly was followed by three from Bill Hennerby. The final score of 4‚Äì6 to 0-12 gave Kilkenny a fourth All- Ireland title and subjected Tipp to a first championship decider defeat. 1910 saw the first ever championship meeting of Wexford and Limerick, as both sides contested the All-Ireland final. The introduction of new rules regarding the ‚Äòparallelogram‚Äô seemed to confuse players and officials. Limerick had a goal disallowed for this reason while Wexford's eighth goal was also ruled out for the same reason. The final was a close game; however, Wexford claimed their first title on a score line of 7‚Äì0 to 6‚Äì2. In 1911 Kilkenny were back in the All-Ireland final after a one-year absence. Munster champions Limerick qualified to provide the opposition. On the day of the final Cork's lower park was water-logged and the game was rescheduled. Limerick were unable to line out in the replay. A meeting by the GAA's Central Council awarded the title to Kilkenny. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô later defeated Tipperary in an alternative game to the All-Ireland final; however, Limerick defeated Kilkenny in a challenge game later in the year. In 1912 Kilkenny reached a second consecutive championship decider. Cork were the opponents on this occasion and a close game developed. Sim Walton was the hero for ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô again as Kilkenny won their sixth All- Ireland title of the decade with a 2‚Äì1 to 1‚Äì3 score line. In 1913 Kilkenny qualified for their third consecutive All-Ireland final and a record seventh appearance in ten championship seasons. Tipperary, the past masters of the competition, provided the opposition. In the first fifteen-a-side final Kilkenny took a 1‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì1 lead at half-time, courtesy of a Matt Gargan goal. Tipp only managed a single point in the second half as Sim Walton scored the deciding goal twelve minutes from the final whistle. The 2‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì2 victory gave Kilkenny a third All-Ireland title in-a-row and a seventh in ten years. Four players ‚Äì Sim Walton, Jack Rochford, Dick ‚ÄòDrug‚Äô Walsh and Dick Doyle ‚Äì made history by winning a seventh All-Ireland winners‚Äô medal. 1914 to 1915 ‚Äì Clare and Laois make the breakthrough In 1914 Clare claimed the Munster title for the first time since 1889. In Leinster Laois also made the breakthrough and claimed their first provincial title. As a result, the All- Ireland final was a unique event. Clare's goal-scoring ability was the crucial deciding factor as Laois were outclassed. A score line of 5‚Äì1 to 1-0 gave Clare their very first All-Ireland title. It would be 1995 before the ‚Äòbanner men‚Äô won the title for a second time. Laois made amends for their defeat the previous year be qualifying for a second championship decider in 1915. Cork provided the opposition and took a half-time lead of 3‚Äì0 to 2-2. A huge downpour resulted in the players donning their overcoats for the second half as Laois launched their comeback. With nine minutes to go Laois scored the winning goal, taking the title by 6‚Äì2 to 4‚Äì1. It was their first and their only All-Ireland title to date. Cork, on the other hand, had to wait until 2011 for the chance to avenge this defeat, which they did in great style beating Laois by a remarkable 10‚Äì20 to 1‚Äì13 in the 2011 All Ireland Qualifier 1916 to 1925 ‚Äì A decade of change book ended by Tipperary In the ten years between 1916 and 1925 no team secured back-to-back All-Ireland titles. In fact, Kilkenny were the last team to achieve this feat in 1913 until Cork did likewise in 1929. In 1916 Tipperary broke back after nearly a decade in the All-Ireland wilderness. Fierce rivals Kilkenny were the opponents in what proved to be a swansong for some of the players from their great team of the previous decade. Both teams were reduced to fourteen players as Tipp trailed by five points; however, they came storming back to win by 5‚Äì4 to 3‚Äì2. Tipperary reached the championship decider again in 1917, this time with Dublin providing the opposition. The metropolitans, a team which contained some players who hailed from Tipperary, gave the reigning champions a lesson in hurling. Joe Phelan scored a hat trick of goals to give Dublin a 5‚Äì4 to 4‚Äì2 victory and their first All-Ireland title of the twentieth century. 1918 saw two new teams come through the provincial series as Limerick and Wexford did battle in the All-Ireland final. Limerick were completely on top for the entire game at had a comfortable 5‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì2 lead at the interval. Willie Gleeson scored a hat trick as Limerick romped to a huge 9‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì3 victory. Like Dublin the year before, this was Limerick's first All-Ireland title of the twentieth century. In 1919 the Cork and Dublin did battle for the championship. From a Cork perspective the game is significant as it was the first time that the players wore the now famous red jersey. Cork proved too good for the metropolitans and had a commanding 4‚Äì2 to 1‚Äì1 lead at the interval courtesy of four goals by Jimmy ‚ÄòMajor‚Äô Kennedy. Dublin could not stop the Cork onslaught as ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô went on to secure a 6‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì4 victory and a first All-Ireland title in sixteen years. The Cork-Dublin rematch took place in 1920. Dublin were out to avenge the defeat of the previous year and came out with all guns blazing. Joe Phelan went on the rampage and scored four goals in quick succession to give the metropolitans a merited 4‚Äì9 to 4‚Äì3 victory. A third consecutive All-Ireland final appearance beckoned for Dublin in 1921; however, on this occasion it was Limerick, the champions of 1918, who provided the opposition. The reigning champions proved no match for the Munster men, with captain Bob McConkey scoring four goals to put his team in the driving seat. The final score of 8‚Äì5 to 3-2 gave Limerick a second All- Ireland title in four years. The 1921 championship marked the first occasion that the Liam MacCarthy Cup was presented to the winning captain. In 1922 Tipperary and Kilkenny broke back into the championship decider. Tipperary looked set for their tenth All-Ireland victory when they took a three-point lead with as many minutes left. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô fought back with two match-winning goals by Paddy Donoghue and Dick Tobin to secure a 4‚Äì2 to 2‚Äì6 victory. Kilkenny would not beat Tipperary in the championship again until 1967. In 1923 the political realities of the era affected the championship. Galway and Limerick qualified for the All-Ireland final; however, Limerick refused to play the game until all Civil War prisoners were released. They were initially disqualified from the title awarded to Galway; however, the game eventually took place. Mick Gill‚Äôs new tactic of lobbing the sliotar into the square paid dividends as Galway scored seven goals over the hour. A 7-3 to 4-5 victory gave Galway an historic first All-Ireland title while it marked the end of the road for the great Limerick team of the era. Galway would not win another championship until 1980. Galway had the chance to defend their title in 1924 when they played Dublin in the championship decider. In an exciting game Dublin came from behind thanks to a Garrett Howard goal to win the title by 5-3 to 2-6. Dublin‚Äôs non-playing captain Frank Wall became the only man to accept the Liam MacCarthy Cup without having played in the final. A third consecutive All-Ireland final beckoned for Galway in 1925, this time with Tipperary providing the opposition. The Munster men opened their account with a goal, followed immediately by a second one. Galway never recovered and suffered a 5-6 to 1-5 defeat. It was Tipperary‚Äôs tenth All-Ireland title. The Tipp victory brought an end to over a decade of the All-Ireland title changing hands on an annual basis. 1926 to 1931 ‚Äì The greatest Cork team After falling behind to Tipperary and Kilkenny in the all-time roll of honour over the previous two decades, Cork broke back in 1926 with a team that has been described as the county‚Äôs finest. After a remarkable three-game Munster final saga with reigning champions Tipperary, Cork qualified for an All-Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. Legendary trainer Jim ‚ÄòTough‚Äô Barry was at the Cork helm for the first, as snow covered Croke Park on the day of the game. The game was played on an even keel in the first-half with Cork leading by a point. ‚ÄòThe Rebels‚Äô stormed ahead in the second half and won the day by 4‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì0. In 1927 Cork were the provincial champions and headed for a second consecutive All-Ireland final, this time with Dublin providing the opposition. ‚ÄòThe Dubs‚Äô were well on top in the opening thirty minutes and took a 2‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì1 lead at the interval. Cork fought back in the third quarter; however, an expert display of goalkeeping by Tommy Daly saved the day as Dublin held on to win by 4‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì3. 1928 saw Cork regroup and, after retaining the Munster title, they qualified for another championship decider. Galway, who got a bye into the final without lifting a hurley, were the opposition on this occasion; however, the men from the west were no match as a rout ensued. A 6‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì0 score line tells its own story as Cork romped to a second All-Ireland in three years. The Cork-Galway rematch took place in the All-Ireland of 1929. Little had changed in a year as Cork were on the top of their game again. A rout ensued as \\"the Rebels\\" claimed a third All-Ireland title from four final appearances with a 4‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì3 score line. For the first time in five years Cork failed to retain their Munster title in 1929. Tipperary emerged from the province on that occasion and lined out against Dublin in the subsequent All- Ireland final. The game was finely balanced until the end of the first-half when goals by Martin Kennedy and J.J. Callanan gave Tipp the edge. The Munster men stormed ahead in the second period of play and won by 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì3. Tipperary completed a clean sweep of hurling titles that year, winning the senior, minor and junior All-Ireland titles. The victory also put Tipp on top of another all-time roll of honour. 1931 proved to be a swansong for the great Cork team of the era. After regaining the provincial title Cork later lined out against Kilkenny in a classic All-Ireland final. After a close game both sides finished level ‚Äì 1-6 apiece. Eudie Coughlan played a captain's role for Cork in that game as he scored a point from his knees to level the scores. The replay of the final took place four weeks later and is regarded as a classic. Cork took the lead at half-time; however, Kilkenny fought back. Both sides finished level ‚Äì 2-5 apiece. After this game, officials pressed for extra time; however, the teams rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of the GAA's Central Council that both counties be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. The first week of November saw the second replay of the All-Ireland final take place. At the third attempt a winner was found as Cork triumphed by 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì4. It was the county's fourth championship title in six years. 1932 to 1936 ‚Äì Kilkenny‚Äôs double and the greatest Limerick team In 1932 Clare surprised everyone by winning their first Munster title in almost twenty years. They later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Kilkenny, the defeated finalists of 1931, provided the opposition. The game was a close one that ebbed and flowed. Kilkenny scored three goals courtesy of Matty Power, Martin White and Lory Meagher direct from a line ball. Clare's Tull Considine replied with two goals himself and was foiled for an almost certain third. The final score of 3‚Äì3 to 2-3 gave victory to ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô. It would be 1995 before Clare made their next appearance on All-Ireland final day. 1933 saw the greatest Limerick team of all-time make their first foray into the annals of greatness by qualifying for the championship decider. Kilkenny provided the opposition in what was their third consecutive appearance in the final. A then record crowd of 45,000 turned up at Croke Park with another 5,000 spectators being locked outside the stadium. The game was a close affair, only won with a Johnny Dunne goal for Kilkenny with ten minutes left. A score line of 1‚Äì7 to 0-6 gave Kilkenny a second consecutive All-Ireland title and left Limerick's hopes in tatters. In 1934 Limerick retained their Munster dominance and qualified for a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Dublin, the newly crowned Leinster champions, provided the opposition. The game was an exciting affair, with veteran Bob McConkey being knocked unconscious twice. Dave Clohessy scored two goals, leaving Dublin trailing by five points with five minutes left. ‚ÄòThe Dubs‚Äô staged a remarkable comeback to draw the game and force a replay. The replay was also an exciting affair that finished with a flourish. With two minutes to go the sides were level again. Limerick had scored 4‚Äì0 to Dublin's 2‚Äì6. Mick Mackey and Jackie O'Connell pointed for Limerick before Dave Clohessy struck again for his fourth goal of the game. The 5‚Äì2 to 2‚Äì6 score line gave Limerick the victory and an All-Ireland title. 1935 saw Limerick and Kilkenny do battle in another All-Ireland final. Limerick came into the match with an unbeaten run of thirty-one games and as the reigning champions. A downpour ruined the game for spectators as Kilkenny's Martin White scored a great goal to give 'the Cats' a five-point lead with time running out. Mick Mackey smashed a free into the net before Mickey Cross pointed; however, it was not enough. Kilkenny won their third All-Ireland of the decade by 2‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì4. For the third time in four years Kilkenny and Limerick lined out to do battle on All-Ireland final day. Kilkenny had won the previous two encounters; however, Limerick's time was coming. Jackie Power scored two key goals for the Munster champs in the opening thirty minutes, taking the sting out of the Kilkenny attack. Three more goals followed in the second half as Limerick won by 5‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì5. It was their second championship title in three years. 1937 to 1940 ‚Äì The cup goes to Munster then Leinster and back again For the sixth time in seven years Kilkenny reached the All-Ireland final. Tipperary provided the opposition in their first outing in the championship decider since 1930. The game itself was played at FitzGerald Stadium in Killarney, due to the fact that the new Cusack Stand would not be finished in time at Croke Park. Tipperary surprised even themselves with a remarkable display in what proved to be the great Lory Meagher's last game with ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô. Kilkenny could only muster three points as Tipp scored 3‚Äì11 in a humiliating trouncing. The 1938 championship decider was the first since 1930 not to feature either Limerick or Kilkenny. Waterford made history by winning their first Munster title ever. A subsequent defeat of Galway allowed them advance to the All-Ireland final. Dublin, the defeated finalists of four years earlier, provided the opposition. A goal by Declan Goode after just six minutes gave Waterford a dream start; however, Dublin's experience was the key. Goals by Mick Flynn and Bill Loughnane effectively nullified the Waterford attack and won the game for ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô. The 2‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì6 score line gave Dublin a sixth All-Ireland title in all. They have failed to win another since then. The 1939 All-Ireland final between Cork and Kilkenny is regarded as one of the most famous championship deciders of all-time. Known as ‚Äòthe thunder and lightning‚Äô final the match was played on the eve of World War II. Cork were looking for a first championship title since 1931, while Kilkenny were looking for a fourth All-Ireland title of the decade. The game was an exciting one with an explosive finish, as a spectacular thunderstorm lit up proceedings and doused spectators and players alike in the final period. Willie Campbell landed a long-range free in the net for an equalizing goal for Cork and a draw looked likely. Terry Leahy doubled on a Paddy Phelan 70-yard free to secure the winning point for Kilkenny. The 2‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì3 score line gave Kilkenny the victory and put them joint first with Kilkenny on the all-time roll of honour. The 1940 All-Ireland final saw Limerick and Kilkenny, the two most outstanding teams of the decade, do battle for the final time. Kilkenny were the reigning champions as Limerick looked to be a spent force. It was this presumption that spurred on the Munster men. Paddy Scanlan was the goalkeeper from Ahane,(Paddy Healy was the Limerick Minor goalkepper that day, when the double was achieved) he obtained two gold medals. Early in the second half all was not going well as Limerick trailed by 1‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì2. Mick Mackey worked his magic again when he was moved to centre-forward. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô only managed another point while Limerick scored two more goals. A 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì7 score line gave Limerick the victory and a third All-Ireland title inside seven seasons. The victory brought an end to the era of the greatest Limerick team of all-time, as it would be 1973 before Limerick won the championship again. 1941 to 1944 ‚Äì Cork‚Äôs four-in-a-row Although not regarded as the greatest team of all-time, the Cork team of the 1940s has a unique record that proved elusive to all other \\"great\\" teams that came before. In winning four consecutive All-Ireland titles Cork set a benchmark in the championship that set them apart as hurling royalty. The four-in-a-row story began in 1941 with a bizarre twist to the championship. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in some parts of Munster and south Leinster forced Tipperary and Kilkenny to withdraw from the championship. Because of this only Cork and Limerick participated in the Munster championship. Cork had hammered Limerick in the Munster semi-final and were nominated to be Munster's representatives in the All-Ireland final against Dublin. The game turned into a rout as Cork won the handiest championship ever by 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì6. The delayed Munster final took place in October with Tipperary beating Cork. For the first time ever a team were All-Ireland champions but were provincial runners-up. The Cork-Dublin rematch took place in the 1942 All-Ireland final. This time the game was a lost closer with Cork only leading by 1‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì1 at half-time courtesy of a Johnny Quirke goal. Derry Beckett got a second for Cork just before the final whistle as Dublin missed several goal chances. The full-time score read Cork 2-14, Dublin 3‚Äì4. In 1943 Cork again took the hurling world by storm and booked their place in a third consecutive All-Ireland final. History was made on that day as for the first time ever a team from Ulster provided the opposition. Antrim came to Croke Park with high expectations after defeating both Galway and Kilkenny on their way to the final. Unfortunately, a rout ensued. At half-time Cork had a 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì2 lead after dominating almost every aspect of the game. Cork had two more goals disallowed, just enough to keep them out of the record books. A further 2‚Äì5 in the second-half gave ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô a 5‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì4 victory and a third consecutive All-Ireland title for the second time in their history. In 1944 Cork set out to break all records by winning the championship for a fourth successive time. All went to plan as \\"the Rebels\\" qualified for another championship decider. For the third time in four years Dublin provided the opposition. The opening thirty minutes was a low-scoring affair; however, Cork still took a 0‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì2 lead. Cork forged ahead in the second-half with Joe Kelly scoring two goals to secure a 2‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì2 victory and a remarkable fourth All-Ireland title in succession. 1945 to 1948 ‚Äì Four years, four champions Five All-Ireland titles in-a-row proved beyond the great Cork team of the era, as Tipperary emerged from the wilderness to book their place in the 1945 championship decider. In Leinster Kilkenny also emerged from the doldrums and provided the opposition in the final. Tipp raced into a stunning lead and left Kilkenny trailing by 4‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì3 at half-time. Three goals by ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô turned the tide; however, it wasn't enough as Tipperary won by 5‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì6. In 1946 Cork proved that the four-in-a-row team was not finished yet. They booked their place in the All- Ireland final for the sixth time in nine years, this time with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The first half was played on an even keel; however, two goals in two minutes just before half-time gave Cork a boost. A great solo-run goal by captain Christy Ring put ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô four points ahead. Cork ran riot in the second-half, scoring five goals and winning easily by 7‚Äì5 to 3‚Äì8. The Cork-Kilkenny rematch took place in the championship decider of 1947. The game itself is often described as the greatest All-Ireland final of them all. Jim Langton and Terry Leahy spearheaded the Kilkenny attack, while Mossy O'Riordan and Joe Kelly scored goals for Cork that nearly won the game. In the end Kilkenny won by the ‚Äòusual point‚Äô on a score line of 0‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì7, thus avoiding the ignominy of becoming the first team to lose three-in-a-row. 1948 saw two new teams contest the All-Ireland final in the forms of Waterford and Dublin. Both sides met in the championship decider a decade previously, with Dublin taking the spoils on that occasion. This game was different as Waterford took a nine-point lead at half-time courtesy of goals by John Keane and Willie Galvin. Four more goals followed for ‚Äòthe D√©ise‚Äô in the second- half, as Waterford won comfortably by 6‚Äì7 to 4‚Äì2. It was their first All- Ireland title ever. 1949 to 1954 ‚Äì Cork and Tipperary: the greatest rivalry The Cork-Tipperary rivalry cemented itself as the preeminent rivalry in hurling during the 1950s, capturing the imaginations of the public and providing some classic games. For a county with such a proud hurling tradition Tipp had fallen on hard times by the late 1940s. Over the course of the previous twenty years the county had only won three All-Ireland titles. Tipperary's fortunes changed in 1949 when ‚Äòthe premier county‚Äô broke Cork's stranglehold on the championship. Tipp later annexed the Munster title and qualified for the All-Ireland final. Laois provided the opposition on that occasion; however, the game turned into a rout. Tipp opened the floodgates and secured an easy 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì3 victory. In 1950 Tipperary were back in another All-Ireland final, this time with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The game was a dull affair; however, Tipp won the day by a single point. The Tipperary dominance continued in 1951 with ‚Äòthe premier county‚Äô reaching a third consecutive championship decider. An up-and-coming Wexford team were the opponents and a high-scoring game ensued. Nicky Rackard‚Äôs artistry was no match for Tipperary‚Äôs defence and a 7-7 to 3-9 score line gave Tipp a third consecutive All-Ireland title. In 1952 Tipperary were again the favourites to retain the All-Ireland title, thus equaling the record of the nine ‚Äì Cork‚Äôs seemingly unbeatable tally of four consecutive championships. A classic Munster final put an end to Tipp‚Äôs dream, as Cork were the ones who advanced to the All-Ireland final. Dublin provided the opposition; however, ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô had an easy 2‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì7 victory. An impressive Munster final defeat of Tipperary in 1953 meant Cork went into the subsequent All-Ireland final as red-hot favourites. Galway were there to stop them from retaining the title, and one of the dirtiest championship deciders of all-time followed. Cork won the day by 3‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì8. In 1954 Cork got the better of Tipperary in another classic Munster final. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw the clash of Cork and Wexford. A record crowd of 84,000 people crammed into Croke Park, all anticipating a high-scoring game. The game was a close and tense affair, with Cork coming from four-points down to win by 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì6. It was a third consecutive All-Ireland title for Cork and a record eighth All-Ireland winners‚Äô medal for Christy Ring. 1955 to 1956 ‚Äì Wexford arrive Wexford had been the All-Ireland runners-up on two occasions earlier in the decade. All changed in 1955 with \\"the yellowbellies\\" reaching a third final since 1951. Galway, who received a bye into the final without picking up a hurley, were the opponents. The men from the west proved no opposition as Wexford claimed a first title in forty-five years on a score line of 3‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì8. In 1956 Wexford proved that their victory the previous year was not a fluke by reaching the championship decider again. A sterner test awaited them as Cork provided the opposition. In one of the most famous All-Ireland deciders of them all, Nicky Rackard bested Christy Ring to help his county to a 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì8 victory and an unprecedented second consecutive championship. 1957 to 1959 ‚Äì Kilkenny and Waterford come in from the cold The hurling world witnessed a shock in 1957 when Waterford emerged from Munster after a nine- year period in the wilderness. A series of unexpected victories saw the men from ‚Äòthe Deise‚Äô qualify for the All-Ireland final against neighbours Kilkenny. Waterford nearly confounded the critics as they led by six points with three-quarters of the game played. Kilkenny fought back to win by 4‚Äì10 to 3-12, thus coming in from the wilderness themselves to claim a first championship since 1947. In 1958 Waterford were unable to retain their provincial title as Tipperary fought back with one last kick by the great three-in-a-row team of the early part of the decade. Kilkenny also failed to retain their All-Ireland title as Tipp faced Galway in the championship decider. The men from the west received a bye into another final; however, it did little to revive the flagging fortunes of hurling in Connacht. Tipp got four goals against the wind in the first half to secure a 4‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì5 win. Following this defeat Galway retreated to the Munster championship, where they played for ten years. Waterford were back in the championship decider again in 1959 and, for the second time in three years, Kilkenny were the opponents. The game saw ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô leak five easy goals, allowing their south-eastern neighbours to clinch a 1‚Äì17 to 5‚Äì5 draw. The replay took place a few weeks later, with Eddie Keher lining out in his first championship decider. That game was an exciting affair also, with Waterford securing a 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì10 victory. It was their second-ever All-Ireland title. 1960 to 1968 ‚Äì The greatest Tipperary team The Tipperary team of the 1960s is remembered as one of the most successful and as one of the most physically intimidating of all- time. Similarly, they are regarded as one of the all-time great teams in the history of the competition. Of the nine All-Ireland finals to take place during this period Tipperary reached seven of them. In 1960 Tipperary were so confident of success that team manager Phil Purcell declared that: Purcell was forced to eat his words; however, having surprisingly lost out to Wexford in 1960 the premier county returned in 1961, taking on the first ‚Äònative‚Äô Dublin hurling team. A tempestuous affair saw Tipperary being put to the pin of their collars. A rout was expected; however, ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô stood toe to toe with the past masters of the competition and eventually lost by just a single point. In 1962 Tipperary secured a third consecutive Munster title and a safe passage into the All-Ireland final, this time taking on old rivals Wexford. Two goals for Tipp in the opening minute gave them a huge boost; however, the match wasn't settled until the final ten minutes when Tom Ryan scored a goal which meant Tipp won by 3‚Äì10 to 2-11. In 1963 Tipperary's dream of three-in-a-row was shattered when Waterford emerged as provincial champions. It was the last kick of a dying team, with Kilkenny providing the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. It was their third meeting at this stage of the competition in seven years. The men from ‚Äòthe Deise‚Äô were losing by eleven points at one stage; however, they managed to bridge the gap to just two by the final period of the game. In the end, however, the young Eddie Keher secured victory for ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô by finishing with a record tally of fourteen points. Tipperary reclaimed the Munster title in 1964 and later lined out against red-hot favourites Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. Kilkenny, however, faced a rejuvenated Tipp who scored five goals, the sixth one being disallowed. Tipp put their great rivals to the sword on a score line of 5‚Äì13 to 2-8 and were champions again. Tipp asserted their dominance of the hurling world again in 1965, lining out against Wexford in the All-Ireland decider. The game failed to live up to expectations as Tipp won easily, courtesy of two unorthodox hand-passed goals and seven unanswered points in the last part of the game. It was a remarkable fourth All-Ireland title in five years and, had it not been for a blip in 1963, Tipperary could have reached the holy grail of five consecutive All-Ireland titles. 1966 saw a respite in the Tipperary dominance of the era with Cork and Kilkenny contesting their first All-Ireland final together since 1947. Furthermore, Cork were playing in their first final in a decade and fielded one of the youngest team's ever. There was even speculation that 45-year-old Christy Ring would be redrafted back onto the panel. In the final itself Cork defeated ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô by 3‚Äì9 to 1-10. Kilkenny returned for a second consecutive final appearance in 1967, this time taking on a Tipperary team that was heading over the hill. A victory for ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô by 3‚Äì8 to 2-7 put an end to a 45-year Tipperary bogey for the Kilkenny hurlers. In 1968 Tipperary contested their seventh All-Ireland final of the decade, having won four and lost two. Furthermore, it was their second consecutive final having lost to Kilkenny the previous year. Wexford provided the opposition for the fourth time that decade and a classic game of hurling ensued. Tipp led by eight points at half-time; however, Wexford fought back to set up a grandstand finish. At the long whistle Wexford triumphed by 5‚Äì8 to 3-12, thus bringing the curtain down on the greatest Tipperary team of all- time. 1969 to 1970 ‚Äì Cork and Kilkenny set the pace In 1969 Cork and Kilkenny began their domination of the complementation that would last for the entire 1970s. Up until then Cork and Tipperary were considered the ‚Äòhurling superpowers‚Äô, with Kilkenny being the distant cousin in Leinster. This all changed during the 1970s. In 1969 Kilkenny took on Cork in the All-Ireland final, a repeat of the 1966 clash. This time, however, the result was different with Kilkenny coming from behind to claim a 2‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì9 victory. Cork returned in 1970, taking on Wexford in the first eighty-minute final. The game itself broke all kinds of records, with a hat-trick of goals by Cork's Eddie O'Brien contributing to an enormous 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10 score line. 1971 to 1975 ‚Äì Kilkenny‚Äôs dominance While the sixties belonged to possibly the greatest Tipperary team of all-time, the early seventies were dominated by one of the greatest Kilkenny teams ever produced by the county. In 1971 ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô reclaimed the Leinster title from Wexford and booked their place in the All- Ireland final. Fierce rivals Tipperary provided the opposition in one of the great All-Ireland finals of the decade. The game was notable as it was the first All-Ireland final to be broadcast in colour by Telef√≠s √âireann. Tipperary relied on two freak goals to put them in the driving seat, one of which passed through Ollie Walsh‚Äôs legs. Kilkenny‚Äôs Eddie Keher surpassed his own record by scoring 2-11, in spite of ending up on the losing side. The game is also memorable for the fact that Michael ‚ÄòBabs‚Äô Keating discarded his boots and socks and played out the last period of the game in his bare feet. The final score of 5‚Äì17 to 5-14 gave Tipperary a merited victory and allowed the team to go top of the all-time roll of honour. Furthermore, Tipp wouldn't win another All-Ireland title for eighteen years. In 1972 Kilkenny had a chance to redeem themselves when they qualified for a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition on this occasion in the only eighty-minute decider between these two great rivals. Cork stormed into an early lead and looked set for victory. Kilkenny, however, fought back after being inspired by a Frank Cummins solo-run goal. After trailing by eight points at one stage ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô leveled the match, thanks in no small part to four great saves by Noel Skehan, and scored seven points without reply to win by 3‚Äì24 to 5-11. 1973 saw Kilkenny reach the championship decider for a third successive year with a third Munster team, Limerick, providing the opposition. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô were severely hampered for a number of reasons as Eamon Morrissey emigrated to Australia, Jim Treacy was injured, Kieran Purcell had appendicitis and Eddie Keher broke his collarbone. An under strength team put up a good showing against Limerick; however, a Mossie Dowling goal eight minutes into the second-half turned the tide. Richie Bennis spearheaded Limerick's attack and they were easy 1‚Äì21 to 1-14 winners in the end. It was their first All-Ireland title since 1940.It should however be noted that Mickey Graham, the first choice center forward on the Limerick panel and Jim O'Donnell the first choice center back, and man of the match against Clare that year, were both missing in '73 and '74 for the Munster men The Kilkenny-Limerick rematch took place in the 1974 championship decider. This time both sides had their full complement of players; however, Limerick were hopeful of retaining the title for the first time in their history. Their expectations were justified when they raced into a five-point lead in the first ten minutes. Kilkenny, however, were the goal-scoring masters and three from Mick ‚ÄòCloney‚Äô Brennan, Pat Delaney and Eddie Keher stopped Limerick. At full-time Kilkenny were the winners by 3‚Äì19 to 1-13. In 1975 Galway booked their place in the All-Ireland final after a stunning victory over Cork in the semi-final. It was their first appearance in a final since 1958. Kilkenny were lining out in a record-equaling fifth championship decider. Galway started quickly again and took the lead in the eighteenth minute with a Frank Burke goal. The men from the west had a three- point lead at the interval with P.J. Qualter scoring a quick goal after the restart. Eddie Keher's 2-7 kept Galway within close range and eventually reeled the in. Kilkenny showed their class to win by twelve points and collect a third All-Ireland title in four years. 1976 to 1978 - A rebel three-in-a- row While Kilkenny dominated the early 1970s, the second part of the decade belonged to Cork. 1976 saw Cork win a second consecutive Munster title, allowing the team to advance directly to the All-Ireland final where Wexford provided the opposition. Both sides had high expectations. Cork got off to the worst possible start in an All-Ireland final and trailed by 2-2 after six minutes. 'The Rebels' battled back; however, the game hung in the balance for much of the seventy. With ten minutes left Wexford were two points to the good; however, three points by Jimmy Barry-Murphy, two by Pat Moylan and a kicked effort from captain Ray Cummins gave Cork a merited 2‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì11 victory. In 1977 Cork cruised through the provincial campaign again and, following a defeat of Galway in the semi-final, the men in red booked their place in a second consecutive All-Ireland final showdown with Wexford. Like the previous year the game turned into a close, exciting affair. A Se√°nie O'Leary goal, together with some brilliant saves by goalkeeper Martin Coleman helped Cork to a 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8 victory. 1978 saw Cork sneak a narrow 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì11 win over Clare in the Munster final, paving the way for 'the Rebels' to take on Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final. The stakes were high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row since 1954. The game, however, was not the classic that many expected. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes. With thirteen minutes left Jimmy Barry-Murphy hit a low shot in towards the goal and it bounced in past goalkeeper Noel Skehan. The goal turned out to be the deciding factor as Cork went on to win the game and a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. 1979 to 1981 - Kilkenny bounce back while Galway and Offaly make history Cork's bid for a record-equalling fourth All-Ireland title in-a-row fell short when the team were beaten by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Because of this the men from the west advanced to the championship decider where Kilkenny were waiting. Unfortunately, the last final of the seventies turned out to be the least exciting of the decade. Galway goalkeeper S√©amus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam 'Chunky' O‚ÄôBrien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half courtesy of a Noel Lane goal; however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for Galway as Kilkenny went on to win by 2‚Äì12 to 1-8 In 1980 Galway reached the All-Ireland final for a second year in-a-row with Munster champions Limerick providing the opposition. An exciting championship decider followed. Bernie Forde and P.J. Molloy goals for Galway meant that the men from the west led by 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì5 at half-time. √âamonn Cregan single-handedly launched the Limerick counter-attack in the second-half. Over the course of the game he scored 2‚Äì7, including an overhead goal and a point in which he showed the ball to full-back Conor Hayes and nonchalantly drove the ball over the bar. It was not enough to stem the tide and Galway went on to win the game. It was the county's first All-Ireland title since 1923 and the celebrations surpassed anything ever seen in Croke Park. It took captain Joe Connolly ten minutes to reach the rostrum in the Hogan Stand to collect the Liam MacCarthy Cup; however, once there he delivered one of the most famous acceptance speeches of all-time. Delivered through his native Irish, Connolly was clearly overcome with emotion as he finished. In 1981 the hurling records continued to tumble as the All-Ireland final was contested by Galway and Offaly. An exciting game developed between these two breakthrough hurling teams with both sides exchanging tit-for-tat scores. After fourteen minutes Pat Carroll scored the opening goal of the game for Offaly; however, neither side built up a strong lead. Straight after the interval goalkeeper Damien Martin was doing great work when he batted out an almost certain Galway goal. With just over twenty minutes left in the game Galway led by six points; however, the team failed to score for the rest of the match. Offaly, on the other hand, ate into this lead. Johnny Flaherty‚Äôs hand-passed goal with three minutes was the deciding score of the game. At the full-time whistle Offaly were the winners by 2-12 to 0-15. Like the championship decider of twelve months earlier, there were great scenes of jubilation as Offaly claimed the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the very first time in their history. 1982 to 1986 - Kilkenny and Cork dominate After the breakthroughs of the previous two seasons the old order was restored in 1982 with Cork and Kilkenny lining out in the championship decider. Cork were the red-hot favourites following a 5-31 to 3-6 trouncing of Waterford in the Munster final, while Kilkenny had a tough route to the final. Kilkenny bucked the trend when Christy Heffernan scored two goals in a forty-second spell just before the interval to take the wind out of Cork's sails. Ger Fennelly got a third goal within eight minutes of the re-start, giving Kilkenny an unexpected 3-18 to 1-15 victory. 1983 saw both Kilkenny and Cork do battle again in the championship decider. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô used a strong wind to dominate the opening half and built up a strong lead. Cork came storming back with goals by Tom√°s Mulcahy and Se√°nie O‚ÄôLeary; however, at the full-time whistle Kilkenny had won by 2‚Äì14 to 2-12. In spite of losing a second All-Ireland final on the trot the Cork team and supporters were optimistic for the following year. 1984 was a special year in the annals of Gaelic games as it was the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Because of the year that was in it, every team made a special effort to claim the All-Ireland title. Kilkenny, the three-in-a-row hopefuls, were ousted at an early stage of the championship. Offaly booked their place in a special All-Ireland final at Semple Stadium with Cork, the Munster champions for the third successive year, soon booking their place. In spite of the GAA celebrating one hundred years, it was their first ever meeting of these two teams in the history of the championship. The centenary-year final failed to live up to expectations and Cork recorded a relatively easy 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12 victory. In doing so Cork claimed their twenty-fifth championship title and avoided becoming the first team to lose three-in-a-row. In a repeat of 1981 both Offaly and Galway lined out against each other in another All-Ireland final. Both teams were out to prove that their earlier All-Ireland victories were not flashes in the pan. A tense game ensued; however, it was Offaly's goal-scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Joe Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given. P.J. Molloy was Galway's goal scorer; however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì12 victory gave Offaly a second All-Ireland title. In 1986 Cork claimed a fifth Munster title in-a-row for the third time in their history, thus booking their spot in the All-Ireland final. Galway, the defeated finalists of the previous year provided the opposition and were the red-hot favourites against an ageing Cork team. On the day, however, a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô to a merited 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory. 1987 to 1988 - Galway break the mould The 1987 championship threw up some interesting surprises. Galway put down an early signal of intent by claiming the National League title at Clare's expense. In Munster Tipperary defeated Cork after a thrilling draw and a replay to deny 'the Rebels' a record-breaking six-in-a-row. In Leinster Kilkenny broke back to take the title and book an All-Ireland final spot against Galway. The prospect of becoming the first team to lose three consecutive championship deciders weighed heavily on the Galway team and probably gave them an extra impetus to win. The game was not a classic by any standard and Noel Lane got a key goal for Galway nine minutes before the end. A 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Galway a second All-Ireland title of the decade and proved that their win in 1980 was not a once-off. In 1988 Galway reached a fourth successive All-Ireland final. After more than a decade-and-a-half in the wilderness Tipperary, the fallen superpower, were back providing the opposition in the championship decider. Galway defeated Tipp in the semi-final the previous year; however, with an extra year's experience it was expected that Tipperary might shade the victory. Galway, however, used this to motivate themselves as they believed their championship victory the previous year did not earn them the respect they were due. Noel Lane again scored the crucial goal for Galway while Nicky English sent a late penalty over the bar for a point. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and a third All-Ireland title, ensuring that the eighties definitely belonged to Galway. 1989 to 1993 - The big three redeem themselves In 1989 Tipperary were still the best team in Munster and won a third provincial title. For the third time in as many years Tipp faced Galway in the All-Ireland series; however, on this occasion the men from the West were without their star player Tony Keady. The game turned out to be a tense and unsavory affair as Tipp finally triumphed over Galway. Antrim, the surprise winners of the other semi-final, provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final. It was an historic occasion as it was only the second appearance of an Ulster team in the championship decider. Antrim's relative inexperience robbed the final of any real element of contest and Tipp romped home to a 4‚Äì24 to 3‚Äì9 win. Nicky English entered the record books with a personal tally of 2-12, while Tipperary preserved their unique record of being the only team to win an All- Ireland title in every decade of the GAA's existence. In 1990 Tipperary looked set for another year of dominance at the top of the hurling world. The Munster final pitted them against Cork; however, Tipperary manager Michael \\"Babs\\" Keating dismissed Cork's chances of a victory. He was forced to eat his words as Cork secured an odds-defying 4‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì14 victory over their greatest rivals. Cork subsequently qualified for another All-Ireland final showdown with Galway. Galway were again the favourites and were out to make amends and capture a third All-Ireland title in four seasons. Shortly after half-time the westerners were up by seven points and were cruising to victory thanks to a masterclass in hurling by Joe Cooney. Cork's Tom√°s Mulcahy, however, played a captain's role and scored a crucial goal that revitalised the Cork attack. The final score of 5‚Äì15 to 2-21 gave Cork the victory in one of the most open and exciting hurling finals in years. Two weeks later the Cork Gaelic footballers claimed the All-Ireland title, thus securing a unique double. Tipperary bounced back in 1991 and defeated Cork in a thrilling Munster final replay. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Tipperary take on Kilkenny for the first time in exactly twenty years. A freak goal by Michael Cleary in the first-half gave Tipp a lead which they never surrendered. A 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì15 victory allowed Tipperary to claim a second All-Ireland title in three years. In 1992 Kilkenny bounced back from the All-Ireland defeat. That year's championship decider saw ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô take on Cork for the first time in nearly a decade. The game was well balanced for the first-half; however, new sensation D.J. Carey scored a goal four minutes before the break. This seemed to give Kilkenny the impetus to go on and win the game. Two more goals by John Power and Michael Phelan in the second-half secured a win for Kilkenny and a first All-Ireland title since 1983. In 1993 Kilkenny were still on top of the hurling world as the team lined out in a third successive All-Ireland final. That year \\"the Cats\\" faced Galway for the first time since 1987. Galway won on that occasion; however, in 1993 they were lagging behind Kilkenny for much of the game. They went a point ahead coming into the last quarter; however, Kilkenny won the match by five points. 1994 to 1998 ‚Äì The underdogs topple the top dogs For five years in the middle of the nineties the so-called ‚Äòweaker counties‚Äô emerged and made hay while the traditional powers found it difficult to retain their status. The Liam MacCarthy Cup traveled to six different counties throughout the nineties, more counties than any other previous decade. Cork, Kilkenny and Tipperary took a back seat as Offaly, Clare, Limerick and Wexford all made their mark. =1994 ‚Äî Offaly triumph in the five-minute final= In 1994 the revolution began with Limerick claiming the Munster title while Offaly emerged as the top dogs in Leinster. Both sides subsequently qualified for the All- Ireland final. The match was a rather unremarkable affair, save for an explosive final five minutes. Offaly trailed by five points with as many minutes left when they were awarded a close-in free. Johnny Dooley was given the signal from the management team to go for a point; however, he decided to ‚Äòdo something different‚Äô. The sliotar ended up in the Limerick net, thus opening the floodgates for a remarkable finish. Seconds later the sliotar flew into the Limerick net again, courtesy of Pat O'Connor. Limerick failed to counter as Offaly tacked on some more points to win by 3‚Äì16 to 2-13. The ‚Äòfive-minute final‚Äô resulted in mixed emotions for √âamonn Cregan, as the Offaly manager was a native of Limerick. =1995 ‚Äî Clare's first in 81 years= 1995 saw the championship embark on a modern departure, when Guinness took over as sponsors of the competition. The championship saw more advancement by the underdogs as the All-Ireland final was contested by Clare and Offaly. The omens pointed towards Offaly retaining their title, particularly since Clare made history by bridging a sixty-three-year gap to even reach the final. At half-time Offaly were in the lead, courtesy of a dropping shot by Michael Duignan which goalkeeper Davy Fitzgerald dropped over his own goal line. √âamonn Taaffe entered the game almost unnoticed in the second-half; however, it was his goal that lifted Clare and eventually resulted in the collapse of the Offaly defence. At the full-time whistle the mould cracked as Clare won by 1-13 t 2‚Äì8. It was their first All-Ireland title since 1914, as the curse of Biddy Earley was finally broken. =1996 ‚Äî Limerick heartbreak as Wexford return= In 1996 the hurling revolution continued. Limerick reached their second All-Ireland final in three years, while Wexford booked their place in the championship decider after a nineteen- year absence. A goal by Tom Dempsey in the opening half gave Wexford a deserved 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10 lead at the interval; however, they had been reduced to fourteen men after the sending-off of √âamonn Scallan. The second-half saw their four-point lead being whittled down to just two points; however, fourteen-man Wexford clung on to win by 1‚Äì13 to 0-14. =1997 ‚Äî Clare's second in three years= The 1997 championship saw the biggest-ever change to the format of the competition. The introduction of the ‚Äòback-door system‚Äô afforded the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists a second chance to challenge for the All-Ireland title. The new format worked well in the inaugural year, as the All-Ireland final was a repeat of the Munster final. For the first time ever the final was contested by two teams from the same province as Clare and Tipperary faced each other for the second time that year. Clare had the upper- hand for much of the game; however, Tipp remained close behind. Liam Cahill and Eugene O'Neill scored two goals for Tipp in the last ten minutes to set up a grandstand finish. A draw looked likely; however, a classic late point from Jamesie O'Connor secured a narrow 0‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì13 victory for Clare. =1998 ‚Äî Offaly: the first back door champions= In 1998 Clare were again the favourites to take a third All-Ireland title in four years after securing the Munster title. Their next game was an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Offaly. The Offaly team had been defeated in the Leinster final, resulting in the players revolting against manager Michael 'Babs' Keating. Clare were the red-hot favourites; however, it took a late equalizer by Jamesie O'Connor to secure a draw. The replay was a bizarre affair. With two minutes left to play Clare were 1‚Äì16 to 2-10 ahead and looked destined for victory; however, referee Jimmy Cooney blew the full-time whistle. The Offaly supporters launched a sit-down protest on the pitch at Croke Park and a second replay was granted. By this stage Clare were exhausted and lost the game by 0‚Äì16 to 0-13. For the second year in-a-row the All-Ireland final was contested by two teams from the same province as Offaly took on Kilkenny. The defeated Leinster finalists, Offaly, had certainly learned from their mistakes with Joe Errity and Brian Whelahan scoring key goals. At the full-time whistle Offaly emerged as the winners by 2‚Äì16 to 1-13. It was the first time that a defeated team had won the All-Ireland title via the \\"back door system\\". 1999 to 2006 ‚Äì The old order restored The promise of the new teams of the nineties failed to materialise as the turn of the new century saw \\"the big three\\" reclaim their dominance at the top of the hurling world. The last All-Ireland final of the decade saw Cork, the Munster champions for the first time since 1992, take on Kilkenny. \\"The Cats\\" were the red-hot favourites going into the game; however, inclement conditions robbed the fans of what was expected to be a classic game of hurling. Kilkenny led by four points with fifteen minutes left; however, Cork fought back. Both sides shot seventeen wides as Cork, with an average age of twenty-two, won the game by 0‚Äì13 to 0-12. It was the first final between both these sides that failed to produce a goal. In 2000 Kilkenny qualified for a third consecutive All-Ireland final; however, the prospect of becoming the first team to lose three-in-a-row loomed large. Offaly, the team defeated by Kilkenny in the Leinster final, came through the \\"back door\\" and booked their place in the championship decider. A rout took place as the men from \\"the faithful county\\" proved no match for the scoring abilities of Henry Shefflin and D. J. Carey. The long whistle signaled a 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14 victory for Kilkenny ‚Äì the millennium champions. 2001 saw Tipperary, the third member of \\"the big three\\", reach the All-Ireland final for the first time in ten years. The men from \\"the premier county\\" renewed their rivalry with Galway, who qualified for the All-Ireland final after a defeat of Kilkenny in the semi-final. Mark O'Leary bagged two goals for Tipp, enough to withstand a mighty comeback by Galway. With nine minutes left Galway only trailed by a point; however, Tipp forged ahead to win by 2‚Äì18 to 2-15. It was their twenty-fifth All-Ireland title. In 2002 Kilkenny captured the National Hurling League title before later lining out in the All-Ireland final. Clare, a team defeated in the opening round of the provincial championship, maneuvered through the newly expanded qualifiers and provided the opposition. Again, Henry Shefflin and D.J. Carey combined to score key goals for Kilkenny, as Clare's forwards missed two goal opportunities. The full-time whistle saw \\"the Cats\\" win by 2‚Äì20 to 0-19. In 2003 Cork put early season background difficulties behind them and qualified for the All-Ireland final. Kilkenny, the reigning champions, provided the opposition as they went in search of a third All- Ireland title in four years. Kilkenny were the favourites; however, Cork did not let ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô run away with the game. Setanta √ì hAilp√≠n leveled with a goal for Cork; however, Martin Comerford‚Äôs goal with five minutes to go sealed the deal as Kilkenny won by 1-14 to 1-11. This victory brought Kilkenny level with Cork at the top of the all-time All-Ireland roll of honour. In 2004, Cork and Kilkenny squared up to the other in another All-Ireland final. ‚ÄòThe Cats‚Äô were going for an unprecedented three-in-a-row and the chance to top the all- time roll of honour. Cork, on the other hand, were out to beat them. A rain- soaked day robbed the fans of a classic for the second time in five years and the first-half left a lot to be desired. Cork took command in the second period of play and scored nine points without reply in the final twenty-three minutes. A 0‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì9 score line gave Cork the victory and put an end to a Kilkenny treble. In 2005 all hurling fans predicted a Cork-Kilkenny showdown for the third year in-a-row; however, the All-Ireland semi-finals proved intriguing. Cork narrowly defeated Clare after a fantastic comeback to book their place in a third consecutive All-Ireland final. Kilkenny, on the other hand, were blindsided by Galway in the second semi-final in one of the games of the decade. The final saw Cork take on Galway in the final for the first time since 1990. Ben O'Connor scored a goal in the sixteenth minute to give Cork a mighty boost. Galway fought back; however, they failed to bridge the gap as Cork ran out 1‚Äì21 to 1-16 winners. It was Cork's thirtieth All-Ireland title as \\"the Rebels\\" preserved their 100% record over \\"the Tribesmen\\" in All- Ireland deciders. Fiji-born team captain Se√°n √ìg √ì hAilp√≠n was lauded for his acceptance speech, delivered in the Irish language. 2006 to 2012 ‚Äì Kilkenny: the hurling benchmark of all time =2006 ‚Äî Kilkenny deny a Rebel treble = In 2006, Kilkenny and Cork renewed their rivalry as both sides qualified for another All-Ireland final. The Leesiders were aiming for a third All-Ireland victory in-a-row; however, revenge was foremost in the minds of Kilkenny as it was Cork who denied their three-in-a-row bid in 2004. On the day Kilkenny were far too strong for Cork as \\"the Cats\\" secured a 1‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì13 victory after a bruising encounter. =2007 ‚Äî Limerick fall to Kilkenny = Andrew O'Shaughnessy (left) representing Munster, played a key role in Limerick's march to the All-Ireland final in 2007. Kilkenny were the pre-tournament favourites in 2007 and proved themselves worthy of this billing by reaching the final with ease. Their dominance continued in the final itself when they defeated Limerick by seven points on a 2‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì15 score line. After scoring two early goals, Kilkenny maintained a lead of at least five points throughout the match and were never in any real danger of losing. By winning their 30th title Kilkenny drew level with Cork on the all-time roll of honour. =2008 ‚Äî Waterford steamrolled as Kilkenny secure a hat-trick of titles = In 2008, Kilkenny again dominated the hurling championship. Tipperary were predicted to challenge \\"the Cats\\" in the championship decider; however, it was first-round losers Waterford who booked their place against Kilkenny in the final. It was their first meeting in the championship decider in forty-five years. In a disappointingly one-sided final, Brian Cody's side produced a near perfect seventy minutes to re-confirm themselves as hurling's kingpins. Waterford endured a nightmare afternoon as arguably the greatest Kilkenny team of all- time secured their first All-Ireland three-in-a-row since 1913. The statistics speak for themselves. A 23-point winning margin, 3-24 from play, only two wides in the entire match and eight scorers in all with Eddie Brennan (2-04) and Henry Shefflin (0-08) leading the way in a 3‚Äì30 to 1‚Äì13 victory. =2009 ‚Äî Kilkenny's four-in-a-row = 2009 All-Ireland final at Croke Park. A crowd of 82,106 at Croke Park was treated to one of the best All-Ireland finals of all-time, and at the end of it all, the Cats were acclaimed as one of the greatest teams of all-time, if not the greatest. Kilkenny created a piece of history with a fourth successive All-Ireland title following a defeat of Tipperary, thus becoming only the second county to put four titles back-to- back, joining the great Cork team of the 1940s in an elite club. For long periods Tipp looked like they were going to end the reign of Brian Cody's side. Tipperary had to play almost twenty minutes with fourteen men following the dismissal of Benny Dunne, and their resolve was finally broken in the final stages, when late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their heroic efforts to secure a 2‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì23 victory. =2010 ‚Äî Tipperary halt the drive for five = Tipperary's first All-Ireland title since 2001 thwarted Kilkenny's bid for a record-breaking fifth successive Liam MacCarthy Cup triumph. Kilkenny's first championship defeat in 22 games was delivered in compelling fashion by the Munster men, who reached the final via the \\"back door\\" with wins over Wexford, Offaly, Galway and Waterford, and in their capacity to avenge the previous season's painful defeat in the decider. Brian Cody's gamble on attacker Henry Shefflin's famous knee did not come off, and the Kilkenny ace was forced to retire injured after just 12 minutes. On the other hand, Liam Sheedy's heroes produced a devastating attacking display, embellished by a Lar Corbett hat-trick of goals as they swept to a 4‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì18 victory. =2011 ‚Äî The wounded cats fight back = Kilkenny held out in a thriller to defeat defending champions Tipperary and win their 33rd All-Ireland title at Croke Park. Meeting in the decider for the third year in a row, two fiercely committed sides laid on another compelling encounter, never waning in its pace and intensity. Michael Fennelly and Richie Hogan grabbed the vital goals, late in each half, while Henry Shefflin celebrated his record-equalling eighth title triumph with a seven- points haul. For Brian Cody, it was also an eighth Liam MacCarthy Cup success as a manager, and this one was achieved against the odds. =2012 ‚Äî Kilkenny's sixth in seven years = On 9 September 2012, Galway faced Kilkenny in an All- Ireland decider for the first time in nineteen years. Both sides had previously met in the Leinster final, with Galway securing a ten-point win and a first provincial title. Joe Canning struck a stoppage time equaliser to send the final to a replay for the first time since 1959. Canning smashed home a brilliant tenth-minute goal, and his 1-6 tally helped the Tribesmen to a 1‚Äì9 to 0-7 interval lead, with Henry Shefflin converting four Kilkenny frees. The Cats went in front, before Niall Burke fired in Galway's second goal. Shefflin finished with 12 points, but Canning's 1-9 tally dictated that two great teams would meet again following a superb encounter. The replay took place three weeks later on 30 September 2012. Galway stunned the reigning champions with two first-half goals, but their task became impossible twenty minutes from the end when they were reduced to fourteen men following Cyril Donnellan's dismissal. Championship debutant Walter Walsh gave a man of the match performance, claiming a 1-3 haul to announce his arrival on the senior stage in spectacular fashion. The 3‚Äì22 to 3-11 Kilkenny victory was a personal milestone for Henry Shefflin, who became the first player to win nine All- Ireland medals on the field of play, and he marked a special occasion with another special performance, contributing nine points to the Kilkenny cause. 2013 - The great levelling off championship =2013 ‚Äî Clare emerge from the pack= Prior to the start of the championship Kilkenny, Tipperary and Galway were the bookmakers favourites as potential All-Ireland champions. Few could have predicted that any other team would make the breakthrough. Former Offaly hurler Danny Owens was fearful for the future, stating that \\"Kilkenny, Cork and Tipperary will win every All-Ireland from now until Kingdom come\\". What subsequently unfolded led to claims of 2013 being the best championship of all-time. After an incredible championship, which saw the three favourites fail to even make the semi-final stage, Cork and Clare emerged at the top of the pile to contest the All-Ireland final. In front of a crowd of 81,651, Clare started brightly with early scores from Darach Honan and Colin Ryan. Clare led by 0‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì10 at the break, and they continued to bring a remarkable intensity to the contest, forcing the Rebels into errors, which they exploited with further scores from Tony Kelly and the unerring Ryan, who steered over his sixth free for a four-point lead. Cork were far from finished, however, and when Pa Cronin saw his chance, he picked his spot with an accurate finish to the net, and the sides were level going into the final five minutes. Patrick Horgan appeared to have won it for them with his tenth score in stoppage-time, but there was still time for Domhnall O'Donovan to pop up with a dramatic leveller in the 73rd minute. The replay just under three weeks later was the first time an All-Ireland hurling decider was played on a Saturday. Clare emerged as champions for the first time since 1997 after defeating Cork by 5‚Äì16 to 3‚Äì16 in a classic at Croke Park. Shane O'Donnell, a late call-up to the starting line-up in place of Darach Honan, justified his inclusion with a stunning individual haul of 3-3, all from play. O'Donnell hit all three goals in the opening nineteen minutes of the first half and while Cork came from eight points down to draw level during the second half, the winners had a kick left in them as goals from Conor McGrath and sub Honan secured a fourth Liam MacCarthy Cup success for Clare. With 18 minutes left on the watch, the scores were level at 1‚Äì16 to 3-10 and they were deadlocked again with ten minutes left as S√©amus Harnedy's goal brought Cork on terms, 2‚Äì16 to 3-13. But Clare's response was magnificent as McGrath crashed home a magnificent 62nd-minute goal into the top corner of the Davin Stand netting. Clare pushed six points clear, 4‚Äì16 to 2-16, before Stephen Moylan‚Äôs stoppage time goal for Cork brought a spellbound Croke Park to life once more. But in the second minute of stoppage time, Honan cut in from the left touchline and somehow managed to bundle the ball over the line for the eighth goal of a quite incredible spectacle. 2014 to 2016 ‚Äî The old firm: Kilkenny and Tipperary =2014 ‚Äî An encore after the greatest final of them all= On 7 September 2014, the Kilkenny-Tipperary hurling rivalry reached its apex with an All-Ireland final display that has come to be regarded as the greatest of all time. Both sides claimed 54 scores and just nine wides between them in a third successive drawn final. As early as the 10th minute, Kilkenny had a two- on-one situation but Colin Fennelly miscued as he attempted to funnel the ball through to brother Michael and the chance was lost. In the 42nd minute, S√©amus Callanan‚Äôs shot was blocked after taking a pass from Lar Corbett and with 13 minutes remaining. Richie Hogan, with a haul of 0-06 from play, picked up the pieces to fire the Leinster champions into a four-point lead, 3-21 to 1-23. But back came Tipp from that four-point deficit, with Callanan and Paddy Stapleton reducing the deficit to just two. T. J. Reid‚Äôs 66th-minute free pushed Kilkenny three ahead again but scores from John O'Dwyer, sub Jason Forde and O‚ÄôDwyer again hauled Tipp level. As the game entered its final plays, there was time for one massive talking point. After Brian Hogan had a highly debatable free given against him, John O‚ÄôDwyer was given a chance to hand Tipp the victory with a 97-metre free. Hawk-Eye confirmed how close he had come to settling a titanic clash, which ended in a draw. The replay three weeks later was a very different game. From the start, Kilkenny went with man- marking roles on the Tipperary danger men. Richie Power struck the first goal in the 59th minute and younger brother John, one of three pre-match changes to the starting team, pounced from close range after Darren Gleeson pulled off a save to keep out a deflected Michael Fennelly effort. Tipperary battled valiantly all the way to the end, and when S√©amus Callanan scored his second goal of the evening in the 69th minute, a grandstand finish looked certain. Colin Fennelly crowned Kilkenny‚Äôs win with the final score of the game as the clock ran out on Tipperary and Henry Shefflin secured a record-breaking 10th winners' medal. =2015 ‚Äî Galway reeled in by Kilkenny= On 6 September 2015, Kilkenny faced a Galway team who had been buoyed by a thrilling win over Tipperary in the All-Ireland semi-final. Galway's reason for optimism seemed justified when they settled well to go 0-4 to 0-2 clear in the 9th minute. Kilkenny pounced for a goal in the 13th minute, T. J. Reid rattling the net after being placed in space by Walter Walsh. A Reid free moments later left the Cats ahead 1-04 to 0-05 but it didn‚Äôt prove a setback for Galway as they pushed forward again. Joe Canning, Jason Flynn and Conor Whelan all weighed in with some memorable points and they enjoyed a three-point advantage at the interval. Kilkenny emerged a different proposition in the second-half and quickly wiped out Galway‚Äôs lead to draw level at 1-11 to 0-14. Trailing by 1-17 to 0-16 at the midway mark of the second-half, the signs looked ominous for Galway as Kilkenny closed out the game in a clinical fashion to secure a 1-22 to 1-18 victory. =2016 ‚Äî Tipperary finally blow Kilkenny away= For the sixth time in eight seasons, Kilkenny and Tipperary faced off in an All- Ireland final on 4 September 2016. The pattern of the first-half saw the teams refusing to yield as they stayed close to each other. Kilkenny may have been in front 0-3 to 0-1 after seven minutes but Tipperary soon reeled them in and the teams were level ten times on the scoreboard in the opening period. Seven minutes after the restart, Kilkenny led by 1-14 to 0-15 after a Kevin Kelly goal, however, they then conceded 1-04 without reply which put Tipperary firmly back in control. By the 55th minute, Tipperary had stormed 1-22 to 1-15 and the final nail was hammered into Kilkenny‚Äôs coffin with John McGrath‚Äôs blast to the net. Richie Hogan slammed a Kilkenny goal in response with a clever ground stroke but Tipperary finished strong and put an end to their Kilkenny bogey with a 2-29 to 2-20 win. 2017 to 2019 ‚Äî Out with the new and in with the old =2017 ‚Äî Glorious Galway= Galway entered the All-Ireland final against Waterford having lost six finals since their previous win in 1988. They started wonderfully to hit four points without replay and scored from their opening nine shots of the game. But Waterford managed to bag two first-half goals, Kevin Moran drilling a shot to the net in the 4th minute and Kieran Bennett‚Äôs long delivery deceiving goalkeeper Colm Callanan in the 21st minute. At the break, Galway were ahead 0‚Äì14 to 2-7 but Waterford got the better of the early second-half scoring exchanges with a Pauric Mahony free nudging them in front 2-12 to 0-17 by the 47th minute. Galway responded magnificently as they went 0-21 to 2-12 clear. Waterford countered again before Galway stood up once more as they clung to a 0-22 to 2-15 lead with ten minutes remaining. They outscored Waterford 0-4 to 0-2 in the finale as they finally delivered the Liam MacCarthy Cup after 29 years. =2018 ‚Äî Unlimited heartbreak no more for Limerick= A remarkable season of championship hurling, the first to employ a new round robin format, saw Galway face Limerck in the All-Ireland final. Limerick got an injection of confidence in the 16th minute with a Graeme Mulcahy goal that arrived moments after Galway had crept in front by 0-6 to 0-5. That provided the platform for Limerick and when their second goal arrived courtesy of Tom Morrissey in the 54th minute it had the feel of sealing the matter. Galway chipped away at Limerick‚Äôs advantage but Shane Dowling netted a third Limerick goal. Limerick led by 3‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì16 with just two minutes of normal time left, however, a madcap and dramatic finale ensued before their status as champions was confirmed. Injury-time goals from Conor Whelan and Joe Canning gave Limerick an almighty fright before Mulcahy scored what proved to be the decisive point to secure the title after a 45-year wait. =2019 ‚Äî Back to the future for Tipperary= Richie Hogan was red-carded in the 2019 All-Ireland final. The decade which saw five different All-Ireland champions ended as it began with a Tipperary-Kilkenny final. Kilkenny had the better of a scrappy opening period, leading by five points after 21 minutes, but a goal from Niall O'Meara kick-started Tipperary‚Äôs revival and just before half-time Richie Hogan was dismissed for a high challenge on Tipperary‚Äôs corner-back Cathal Barrett. Tipperary led by a point at the interval, 1-09 to 0-11 but, like their old rivals have so often done to them, they came storming out in the third quarter. Team captain S√©amus Callanan and John O'Dwyer struck 1-01 apiece to send Tipperary streaking eight clear by the 42nd minute. Kilkenny needed goals after that but Tipperary used the extra man to good effect. Although T. J. Reid led the fight to the end, Tipperary‚Äôs substitutes all got in on the scoring spree to close out a comfortable 14-point win.

He returned to Hibs in February 1889 but found the club floundering due to the mass recruitment of their players by newly-formed Glasgow club Celtic. McMahon eventually followed the path of other former Hibernian favourites, such as Willie Groves, to Celtic in late 1890. He played for the Glasgow team until 1903, making at least 217 appearances and scoring 171 goals. Equally adept at centre forward or inside left, he won three Scottish Cup medals in 1892, 1899 and 1900, and four Scottish League medals in 1893, 1894, 1896 and 1898.Celtic player McMahon, Alexander, FitbaStats His first moment of glory came in the 1892 Scottish Cup Final replay, when he scored two goals in the 5‚Äì1 victory over Queen's Park.

In 1892, following his cup final display, McMahon returned to professional football in England with Nottingham Forest but, after concerted efforts from the Celtic committee, returned to Glasgow without having played for the East Midlands side. The advent of professionalism in Scotland the following year stemmed the southward drift and ensured players such as McMahon could earn sufficient remuneration for their talents by staying in their native country.

Galen, in \\"On Exercise with the Small Ball\\",P.N.Singer, \\"Galen: Selected Works\\" (1997), pages 299-304 describes harpastum as: > better than wrestling or running because it exercises every part of the > body, takes up little time, and costs nothing.\\"; it was \\"profitable training > in strategy\\", and could be \\"played with varying degrees of strenuousness.\\" > Galen adds, \\"When, for example, people face each other, vigorously > attempting to prevent each other from taking the space between, this > exercise is a very heavy, vigorous one, involving much use of the hold by > the neck, and many wrestling holds. An anonymous poetLaus Pisonis, verses 185-187 (translated by J.W. & A.M.Duff). praises the ball skills of Piso: Julius PolluxJulius Pollux, \\"Onomasticon\\", 9.105 includes harpastum and phaininda in a list of ball games: > Phaininda takes its name from Phaenides, who first invented it, or from > phenakizein (to deceive),œÜŒµŒΩŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ∂œâ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A > Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library because they show the ball > to one man and then throw to another, contrary to expectation. It is likely > that this is the same as the game with the small ball, which takes its name > from harpazein (to snatch);·ºÅœÅœÄŒ¨Œ∂œâ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A > Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library and perhaps one would call > the game with the soft ball by the same name. Sidonius Apollinaris describes a ball game in one of his letters:Sidonius Apollinaris, \\"Letters\\", 5.17.7 (translated by O. M. Dalton) > And now the illustrious Filimatius sturdily flung himself into the squadrons > of the players, like Virgil's hero, 'daring to set his hand to the task of > youth'; he had been a splendid player himself in his youth. But over and > over again, he was forced from his position among the stationary players by > the shock of some runner from the middle, and driven into the midfield, > where the ball flew past him, or was thrown over his head; and he failed to > intercept or parry it. More than once he fell prone, and had to pick himself > up from such collapses as best he could; naturally he was the first to > withdraw from the stress of the game. The general impression from these descriptions is of a game quite similar to rugby. Additional descriptions suggest a line was drawn in the dirt, and that the teams would endeavor to keep the ball behind their side of the line and prevent the opponents from reaching it. This seems rather like an \\"inverted\\" form of football. If the opponents had the ball on their side of the line, the objective would seem to be to get in and \\"pass\\" it to another player, or somehow get it back over the line. The ancient accounts of the game are not precise enough to enable the reconstruction the rules in any detail. In an epigram, Martial makes reference to the dusty game of harpasta in reference to Atticus' preference for running as exercise:Martial, \\"Epigrams\\", 7.32 \\"No hand-ball (pila), no bladder-ball (follis), no feather-stuffed ball (paganica) makes you ready for the warm bath, nor the blunted sword-stroke upon the unarmed stump; nor do you stretch forth squared arms besmeared with oil, nor, darting to and fro, snatch the dusty scrimmage-ball (harpasta), but you run only by the clear Virgin water (the Aqua Virgo aqueduct).\\" Monuments Tombstone of a boy with Harpastum ball (Sinj, Dalmatia, Croatia) In the Croatian town of Sinj, a Roman tombstone found in the ruins of the military camp Tilurium, near the modern day Trilj, shows a boy holding a harpastum ball in his hands. The ball that is shown on this monument has hexagonal and pentagonal patterns, similar to a modern-day football (soccer).

It's one of Italy's most popular and top-selling magazines. One of the footers on the front page of the magazine states √® il settimanale che vanta innumerevoli tentativi di imitazione (\\"it is the weekly magazine that boasts countless attempts at imitation\\"). Indeed, numerous other publications have followed in the wake of its popularity. History La Settimana Enigmistica was founded by Giorgio Sisini, a Milan-based Sardinian nobleman, Count of Sant'Andrea.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sisini_(Dizionario- Biografico)/ His father was the founder of the Rotary Club of Sardinia. The first edition of the magazine was published on 23 January 1932 and featured a stylized portrait of Mexican actress Lupe V√©lez on the front cover. The magazine has featured word puzzles contributed by the most famous constructors, including Piero Bartezzaghi, Giancarlo Brighenti, Bruno Makain and Sisini himself. After Sisini died in 1972, the magazine was edited first by Raoul De Giusti and then by Francesco Baggi Sisini. In November 2008, La Settimana Enigmistica reached the milestone of 4,000 issues. Layout The layout of the magazine has remained the same for several years. The heading on the cover is alternatively in one of three primary colours: blue, green, or red. The front cover always features a crossword grid with an inset photograph of a personality from the world of entertainment and sport. Even-numbered editions feature a male personality, while odd-numbered issues feature a female personality. Since 1995, some of the illustrations in the magazine have been printed in colour. One characteristic that makes La Settimana Enigmistica unique is that it does not accept advertising and rarely uses it to sell the magazine. Word Puzzles Many of the word puzzles featured in La Settimana Enigmistica are crosswords. A number of these (usually the level entry ones) use an American-style grid (one containing few black squares). As well as crosswords, the magazine contains many other types of puzzle, including: * variants on the crossword puzzle, such as parole crociate senza schema (diagramless crosswords), syllabic crosswords, cornici concentriche (a barred crossword in which answers read left to right and in concentric rings) and incroci obbligati (a diagramless crossword containing no indication of where the answers are to be written and with clues given in random order); * cryptograph crosswords, in which a number corresponds to a letter; * other types of puzzles based on a grid but unrelated to crosswords in the strict sense of the term, such as la Persiana (literally \\"the persian blind\\") in which the solver has to discover the key of the puzzle based on the first (sometimes second) syllabe of the definitions; * minor puzzles, such as Il Bersaglio (\\"The Target\\"; a puzzle in which words are arranged in rings, the object being to link all of the words via associations or word play, such as anagrams or adding or dropping letters, the completed chain of words ending at the word in the centre of the \\"target\\"); * La pagina della sfinge (\\"The Page of the Sphinx\\"), a page of riddles, anagrams, charades etc., often in verse, in which the aim is to find words related by various types of wordplay; * general-knowledge quizzes; * various illustrated games, such as rebuses, Aguzzate la vista (Spot the difference); Che cosa manca (What's Missing?), a series of apparently identical cartoons in which each is lacking a number of details present in the others, the goal being to find these details; and Il confronto (\\"The Comparison\\"), a puzzle in which two cartoons have a number of details in common but in different places in each; * puzzles of a legal nature, such as Se voi foste il giudice (\\"If you were the judge\\"), inspired by a legal case from real life in which the reader is asked to decide the verdict; and other puzzles in which a cartoon presents a detective story and the reader needs to work out how the detective reached his or her conclusion; * numerical puzzles, such as sudokus and cryptarithms; * curious and unusual facts and stories, such as Forse non tutti sanno che... (\\"Perhaps not everyone knows that...\\"); * Strano ma vero (\\"Strange but true\\"); and Si pu√≤ crederci... o no? (\\"Can you believe it...or not?\\"), in which the user needs to determine which of several seemingly far-fetched stories are true and which are false. Every week there is at least one competition open to readers, with a special annual one in December. The rigorous progressive numbering of all the word puzzles facilitates looking up the solutions, which are normally included in the following issue (the solutions to competitions are published three issues after the competitions appear). Comic Strips As well as the above, many pages carry a cartoon, and there are also whole pages dedicated to humour, with comic strips and jokes from regular contributors. Some of the strips have ongoing themes, such as: *Andy Capp (ended in 2008) *Drabble *The Born Loser *Fred Basset *Willy n' Ethel *The Duplex *Klein Herr Jacob *Bound and Gagged (comic strip) See also * List of magazines in Italy References External links *Official website *Historical pages 1932 establishments in Italy Crossword magazines Italian-language magazines Weekly magazines published in Italy Magazines established in 1932 Magazines published in Milan ","title":"La Settimana Enigmistica"},{"id":"3510227","text":"In the Fishtank 5 is a 1999 EP by Tortoise with The Ex as part of the In the Fishtank project.

Its current CEO is Benjamin Steinbruch.Company Overview of Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional - Bloomberg Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional is the largest fully integrated steel producer in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America in terms of crude steel production. Its annual crude steel capacity and rolled product capacity are 5.6 million and 5.1 million tons, respectively. It produces a broad line of steel products, including slabs, hot- and cold-rolled, galvanized and tin mill products. Its products are used by the distribution, packaging, automotive, home appliance and construction industries. CSN accounted for approximately 49% of the galvanized steel products sold in Brazil. In 2004, it accounted for approximately 98% of the tin mill products sold in Brazil. It is one of the world's leading producers of tin mill products. CSN also owns its own source of iron ore. History =Foundation and expansion (1941-1980)= Construction of Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional (CSN) in 1941. Inauguration by President Eurico Gaspar Dutra of Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional (CSN) in 1946. Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional was created as a state-owned company on April 9, 1941, during the \\"Estado Novo era\\", during the term of Brazilian president, Get√∫lio Vargas, after an agreement between the American and the Brazilian governments (see the Washington Accords) for the construction of a facility that would provide steel for the Allies during the Second World War and later be an aid for Brazil's development. It began its operations in 1946, under Eurico Gaspar Dutra's presidency. CSN was a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941 pursuant to a decree of Brazilian President Get√∫lio Vargas. The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located at Volta Redonda, in Rio de Janeiro State, started production in 1946. It initially produced coke, pig iron castings and long products. Two major expansions were undertaken at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks during the 1970s. The first, completed in 1974, increased installed annual production capacity to 1.6 million tons of crude steel. The second, completed in 1977, raised capacity to 2.4 million tons of crude steel. =1980 - 2005 = CSN underwent another expansion in 1989, increasing capacity to 4.5 million tons of crude steel. The company was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% interest in the company. In 1993, CSN adopted a capital improvement program, which was revised and extended in 1995. The goals were: an increase in annual production of crude steel; improvement in productivity, increase in the quality of the products, and enhancement of the environmental protection and cleanup programs. Since February 1996, all production has been based on the continuous casting process, rather than ingot casting, an alternative method that results in higher energy use and metal loss. From 1996 through 2002, CSN spent the equivalent of US$2.4 billion under the capital improvement program and for operational capacity maintenance, culminating with the revamping in 2001 of Blast Furnace #3 and Hot Strip Mill #2 at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks increasing annual production capacity to 5.6 million tons of crude steel and 5.1 million tons of rolled products, from approximately 5.0 million tons in each case. In 2005 reinforced its position as the largest iron-mining operation in the country, through a controlling stake in Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD). In January 2004, the CSN board announced the approval of investments up to US$820 million to be made through 2007, including: expansion of production at the Casa de Pedra iron ore mine from 15.5 to approximately 40 million tons; expansion of the coal terminal adjacent to the Sepetiba Port facilities to enable annual exports of up to 30 million tons of iron ore; and the construction of a six million-ton pellet plant. The company also explored opportunities for acquisitions or mergers abroad in order to expand output, and proposed to build a new steel plant which would have doubled current annual production of 5.8 million tons of raw steel, at an estimated investment cost of US$2.6 billion. Seeking to maintain focus on its program of acquisitions and growth, CSN set aside $520 million for investments in 2005. =Privatization ( 1993-present )= In 1993 the company was privatized by Itamar Franco's government, during the National Program for Privatization led by the federal government, started by Fernando Collor and continued by Franco.Arquivo Nacional (Brasil), Os Presidentes e a Rep√∫blica: Deodoro da Fonseca a Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, 2¬™ ed., Rio de Janeiro, 2003, pg. 189. Its main factories were located in Volta Redonda, at the Vale do Para√≠ba region, southern Rio de Janeiro state, and its iron mines at Congonhas and Arcos, both of them cities in the Minas Gerais state, and the coal mines at Sider√≥polis, Santa Catarina state. During almost 50 years of state control, the Brazilian flat steel sector was coordinated on a national basis under the auspices of Siderbr√°s, the national steel monopoly. The state had far less involvement in the non-flat steel sector, which has traditionally been made up of smaller private sector companies. The larger integrated flat steel producers operated as semiautonomous companies under the control of Siderbr√°s and were individually privatized during 1991 to 1993. Proposed merger/acquisition with Corus :Main article Corus ¬ß Takeover In 2006 CSN made a rival bid to acquire the Anglo-Dutch steel firm Corus, following an announcement the acquisition of Corus by Tata Steel of India for $8.1 billion (¬£4.5 billion, or ¬£4.55 per share). Competitive bidding between the two companies raised the final price to ¬£6.08 per share in 2007, with Tata outbidding CSN. CSN and Corus had earlier been partners in a Portuguese venture until early this year, when Corus sold its stake to CSN. Production Panoramic view of the Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional, in the Center of the city of Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil CSN primarily operates as an integrated steel producer in Brazil. It produces a line of steel products, including slabs, which are semi-finished products used for processing hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or coated coils and sheet products; hot- rolled products comprising heavy-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets, and light- gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets; cold-rolled products, including cold-rolled coils and sheets; and galvanized products consisting of flat-rolled steel coated with zinc or a zinc-based alloy. The company also offers tin mill products, including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products. CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies. The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors. It is considered one of the most productive steel-makers in the world, producing more than 6 million tons of raw steel and more than 5 million tons of laminates per year. Holdings CSN owns different firms, such as GalvaSud (in Porto Real, Rio de Janeiro), Inal (in Mogi das Cruzes, S√£o Paulo and Barra Mansa, Rio de Janeiro), CSN PARAN√Å (in Arauc√°ria, Paran√°) and container (TECON) and coal (TECAR) terminals in the Itagua√≠ port (in Itagua√≠, Rio de Janeiro). It also has control through shareholding in MRS Logistics, CFN, in railway transportation, the hydroelectric generators of Igarapava between the S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais states and It√°, between Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states, and factories in the United States and Portugal. Domestic government policies =Anti-dumping, Countervailing Duties, Safeguards and Government Protectionism= Protectionist measures adopted by the governments in some of CSN's main markets could adversely affect crucial export sales. In response to the increased production and exports of steel in many countries, anti-dumping, countervailing duties and safeguard measures have been imposed by countries which represent some of the main markets for CSN exports. Those, and similar, measures could provoke an imbalance in the international steel market, which could adversely affect CSN's exports. =Potential Costs of Environmental Compliance; Mining Regulation= New environmental standards imposed on CSN may require capital expenditures that do not increase productivity. CSN's steel-making facilities are subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and permit requirements in Brazil relating to the protection of human health and the environment. =Dependence on Water Source= Large amounts of water are required in the production of steel. CSN's principal source of water is the Para√≠ba do Sul river, which runs through the city of Volta Redonda. Much of the water is recirculated, and some, after processing, is returned to the Para√≠ba do Sul river. A law passed in 1997 permits the Brazilian government to charge for water usage from water courses. Brazilian government policies in the energy sector may have an adverse impact on the cost or supply of electricity for CSN aluminum-related and ferroalloy operations. Tax and Social Security Reforms May Affect the Brazilian Economy, and May Impose a Higher Tax Burden on CSN. The Brazilian Federal Congress has recently amended the Brazilian Constitution to modify certain aspects of the social security and tax system. Moreover, the Brazilian Federal Congress is currently reviewing additional bills which would introduce further changes to Brazil's tax and social security laws. Such reforms may affect Brazilian economic conditions generally, and may impose a higher tax burden on CSN. If CSN is not able to pass the cost of such potential higher tax and social security burdens to customers, their profit margins may be adversely affected. =Mining Concessions= CSN mining operations are governed by the Brazilian Constitution and the Mining Code and are subject to the laws, rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Constitution and the Code. Under the Brazilian Constitution, all mineral resources belong to Brazil. CSN mining activities at the Casa de Pedra mine are based on holding of a Manifesto de Mina, which gives them full ownership over the mineral deposits existing within their property limits. CSN mining activities at the Bocaina mine are based on a concession which gives them the right to mine for as long as ore reserves exist. =Fluctuation of the Real Exchange Controls= Fluctuation in the exchange rate of the real can adversely affect CSN earnings. Historically, emerging markets, including Brazil, have experienced devaluation of their currency at various times. In 2002, the Brazilian exchange rate fluctuated from a low of R$2.2709 per US$1.00 to a high of R$3.9552 per US$1.00. On June 6, 2005, the rate was R$2,4576 per US$1.00. The real depreciated against the U.S. dollar approximately 2.3% in 2002, due in part to the continued economic and political uncertainties in Brazil and other emerging markets and the global economic slowdown. In 2003 and 2004, the real appreciated 18.2% and 8.1%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. In the first quarter of 2005 the real depreciated 1% against the U.S. dollar. Further fluctuations in the Brazilian currency, in relation to the U.S. dollar or other currencies, may have an adverse effect on CSN's financial condition and results, increasing the cost in reals of CSN's foreign currency denominated borrowings and imports of raw materials, particularly coal and coke. =Inflation and Interest Rate Risks= High inflation rates have in the past had negative effects on the Brazilian economy and CSN's business. During 2002, the Central Bank raised Brazil's base interest rate by a total of 7.5% to 26.5% as a result of the growing economic crisis in Argentina, one of Brazil's primary trading partners, the lower level of growth of the U.S. economy and the economic uncertainty caused by the Brazilian presidential elections, among other factors. During 2003, the Central Bank decreased Brazil's interest rate from 26.5% to 16.5%, reflecting the good momentum and inflation stability in line with the Central Bank's inflation target. During 2004, the Central Bank increased Brazil's base interest rate by 1.25% to 17.75%, on concerns that growth in Brazil's gross domestic product could jeopardize the inflation target. Competition The main competition of CSN in Brazil are Arcelor Brazil, Metallurgica Gerdau, Companhia Sider√∫rgica Paulista (COSIPA), Usiminas and CST-Brazil. The primary competitive factors in the domestic market include quality, price, payment terms and customer service. Although CSN competes with other integrated Brazilian steel mills, it has not experienced significant import competition in Brazil from foreign steel companies. Several foreign steel companies, however, are significant investors in Brazilian steel mills. CSN has these competitive advantages over its Brazilian competitors: ‚Ä¢ Its focus on selling high margin products, such as tin plate, pre-painted, galvalume and galvanized products, in its product mix. ‚Ä¢ It owns its iron ore reserves, compared to domestic competitors who purchase their iron ore requirements (mainly from Vale). ‚Ä¢ It has a well-developed logistics infrastructure, from the iron ore mine to its steel mill and its own ports. ‚Ä¢ It is self-sufficient in energy, through the hydroelectric plants of It√° and Igarapava, and its own thermoelectric plant inside the Volta Redonda mill. ‚Ä¢ GalvaSud, a 100% subsidiary of CSN, provides material for exposed auto parts, using hot-dip galvanized steel and laser-welded blanks, a trend in this industry. This, together with the hot-dip galvanizing process know-how of CSN, allows them to dominate the automotive segment. ‚Ä¢ CSN Paran√°, another subsidiary of CSN, provides additional capacity to produce high-quality galvanized, galvalume and pre-painted steel products for the construction and home appliance industries. Being a Brazilian company, principal competitive advantages of CSN are its abundant supply of low-cost, high-grade iron ore, low-cost labor and energy resources, and good quality of its infrastructure (railways and ports, mainly). It is also benefited from a vast internal market present in Brazil with a large growth potential. As a result of these advantages, CSN has one of the lowest steel production costs in the world.

Biography Moshe Nissim was born in Mandatory Palestine. He studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and served as an Officer of Justice in the Israel Defense Forces during his national service. He is the son of Rabbi Isaac Nissim, who served as Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1955 to 1973. Political career Nissim was first elected to the Knesset in 1959 as a member of the General Zionists. However, he lost his seat in the 1961 elections, and did not reappear in the Knesset until 1969, when he was elected on the list of Gahal (a merger of Herut, the General Zionists and the Progressive Party). In 1973 Gahal became Likud, with Nissim serving as the party's parliamentary chairman between 1973 and 1977. Following Likud's victory in the 1977 election, Nissim was appointed Minister without Portfolio in Menachem Begin's government in January 1978. He became Minister of Justice in August 1980, a role he retained until April 1986 when he became Minister of Finance.

By the 1990s, Ripspeed's main rivals were Demon Tweeks and Grand Prix Racewear, both owned by racing drivers, Alan Minshaw and Ray Bellm respectively. In 1996, Ripp sold Ripspeed to Tony Joseph. He then relocated the store from its original premises to a large one on Fore Street Edmonton. with a plan for expansion in other areas. In turn Ripspeed relocated for a second time to an industrial estate in Enfield but this plan came to an abrupt end when the company collapsed due to financial problems after two years of ownership. Ripp with his two sons Adrian and Jason later started up Xtreme Motorsport, based in Harlow, Essex, which in turn was sold off in 2001. The Ripp brothers later founded R-Tec Auto Design, based in St Albans, Hertfordshire. In early 1999, Halfords took over the brand. One of the biggest changes was discarding the motorsport retail side of its business to concentrate on the lucrative boy racer market.

In such a point group, for every point (x, y, z) in the unit cell there is an indistinguishable point (-x, -y, -z). Such point groups are also said to have inversion symmetry. Point reflection is a similar term used in geometry. Crystals with an inversion center cannot display certain properties, such as the piezoelectric effect. The following space groups have inversion symmetry: the triclinic space group 2, the monoclinic 10-15, the orthorhombic 47-74, the tetragonal 83-88 and 123-142, the trigonal 147, 148 and 162-167, the hexagonal 175, 176 and 191-194, the cubic 200-206 and 221-230. Point groups lacking an inversion center (non-centrosymmetric) can be polar, chiral, both, or neither. A polar point group is one whose symmetry operations leave more than one common point unmoved. A polar point group has no unique origin because each of those unmoved points can be chosen as one. One or more unique polar axes could be made through two such collinear unmoved points. Polar crystallographic point groups include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A chiral (often also called enantiomorphic) point group is one containing only proper (often called \\"pure\\") rotation symmetry.

The tune was adapted from Lead Belly's \\"If It Wasn't for Dicky\\" (1937), which in turn was adapted from the traditional Irish folk tune \\"Drimindown / Drumion Dubh\\". The Weavers first released the song in 1951 as a Decca single, which reached #19 on the Billboard chart and #20 on the Cashbox chart in 1951.Songs from the Year 1951. tsort.info. History In his 1993 book Where Have All the Flowers Gone, Pete Seeger described the long genesis of this song. Apparently the folk musician Lead Belly heard Irish performer Sam Kennedy in Greenwich Village singing the traditional Irish song \\"Drimmin Down\\" aka \\"Drimmen Dow\\", about a farmer and his dead cow. (The song, in fact, is called \\"An droimfhionn donn dil√≠s\\" (\\"The whitebacked brown faithful cow/calf\\"). It is of the type categorized as \\"aisling\\" (dream) where the country of Ireland is given form. Most times the form is that of a comely young woman but here it is the faithful handsome cow.) Lead Belly adapted the tune for his own farmer/cow song \\"If It Wasn't for Dicky\\", which he first recorded in 1937. Lead Belly did not like the lack of rhythm, which had been a part of many free-flowing Irish songs, so he made the piece more rhythmic, playing the chorus with a twelve- string guitar. Seeger liked Lead Belly's version of the tune, and his chords as well. In 1950, the quartet The Weavers, which Seeger belonged to, had made a hit version of Lead Belly's \\"Goodnight, Irene\\", and they were looking for new material. Seeger and Lee Hays wrote new lyrics (Hays wrote all new verses, Seeger re-wrote Lead Belly's chorus), turning \\"If It Wasn't for Dicky\\" into a love song. \\"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\\" was published in 1951 and recorded by The Weavers on June 12, 1951 in New York City for Decca Records (catalog number 27670), reaching #19 on the US Hit Parade. The music was credited to \\"Joel Newman\\" and the lyrics to \\"Paul Campbell\\", both names being pseudonyms for Howard Richmond, The Weavers' publisher.\\"Howie Richmond copyrighted many songs originally in the public domain but now slightly revised to satisfy Decca and also to reap the profits,\\" Ronald D. Cohen, Rainbow Quest: the Folk Music Revival and American Society (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press), page 71. By so doing, Richmond could reap both the publishers' share and also the composers share of the song's earnings.

Others are Ludlow Music, Folkways Music, Essex, Hollis, Hampstead House, Worldwide Music, Melody Trails, and Cromwell.See Music Publisher's Directory In his 1993 book, Seeger wrote: \\"Now, who should one credit on this song?

This followed an experience in which McIntire reports having died and gone to Heaven where he had a long conversation with Christ, was given a drink of water before he was returned to his body for several years. McIntire used this last part of his life to write his story which recounts his various careers as a Ranger, a buffalo hunter, an Indian fighter, a cowboy, a sheepherder, a saloon keeper, a deputy sheriff, and a wanted outlaw.

The specification of IEC 61499 defines a generic model for distributed control systems and is based on the IEC 61131 standard. The concepts of IEC 61499 are also explained by Lewis and Zoitl Alois Zoitl and Robert Lewis: Modelling control systems using IEC 61499. 2nd Edition, Control Engineering Series 95, The Institution of Electrical Engineers, London July 2014. as well as Vyatkin.Valeriy Vyatkin: IEC 61499 Function Blocks for Embedded and Distributed Control Systems Design, Instrumentation Society of America, USA, 2006, 2011 (second edition), 2014 (third edition in German and English)  Part 1: Architecture  IEC 61499-1 defines the architecture for distributed systems. In IEC 61499 the cyclic execution model of IEC 61131 is replaced by an event driven execution model. The event driven execution model allows an explicit specification of the execution order of function blocks. If necessary, periodically executed applications can be implemented by using the E_CYCLE function block for the generation of periodic events as described in Annex A of IEC 61499-1. IEC 61499 enables an application-centric design, in which one or more applications, defined by networks of interconnected function blocks, are created for the whole system and subsequently distributed to the available devices. All devices within a system are described within a device model. The topology of the system is reflected by the system model. The distribution of an application is described within the mapping model. Therefore, applications of a system are distributable but maintained together. IEC 61499 is strongly influenced by Erlang, with its shared-nothing model and distribution transparency. Application and device model of IEC 61499 Like IEC 61131-3 function blocks, IEC 61499 function block types specify both an interface and an implementation. In contrast to IEC 61131-3, an IEC 61499 interface contains event inputs and outputs in addition to data inputs and outputs. Events can be associated with data inputs and outputs by WITH constraints. IEC 61499 defines several function block types, all of which can contain a behavior description in terms of service sequences: Function block interface * Service interface function block ‚Äì SIFB: The source code is hidden and its functionality is only described by service sequences. * Basic function block - BFB: Its functionality is described in terms of an Execution Control Chart (ECC), which is similar to a state diagram (UML). Every state can have several actions. Each action references one or zero algorithms and one or zero events. Algorithms can be implemented as defined in compliant standards. * Composite function block - CFB: Its functionality is defined by a function block network. * Adapter interfaces: An adapter interface is not a real function block. It combines several events and data connections within one connection and provides an interface concept to separate specification and implementation. * Subapplication: Its functionality is also defined as a function block network. In contrast to CFBs, subapplications can be distributed. To maintain the applications on a device IEC 61499 provides a management model. The device manager maintains the lifecycle of any resource and manages the communication with the software tools (e.g., configuration tool, agent) via management commands. Through the interface of the software tool and the management commands, online reconfiguration of IEC 61499 applications can be realized.Alois Zoitl Real-Time Execution for IEC 61499, Instrumentation Society of America (ISA), USA, , November 2008.  Part 2: Software tool requirements  IEC 61499-2 defines requirements for software tools to be compliant to IEC 61499. This includes requirements for the representation and the portability of IEC 61499 elements as well as a DTD format to exchange IEC 61499 elements between different software tools. There are already some IEC 61499 compliant software tools available. Among these are commercial software tools, open-source software tools, and academic and research developments. Usually an IEC 61499 compliant runtime environment and an IEC 61499 compliant development environment is needed.  Part 3: Tutorial Information (2008 withdrawn)  IEC 61499-3 was related to an early Publicly Available Specification (PAS) version of the standard and was withdrawn in 2008. This part answered FAQs related to the IEC 61499 standard and described the use of IEC 61499 elements with examples to solve common challenges during the engineering of automation systems. Among other examples, IEC 61499-3 described the use of SIFBs as communication function blocks for remote access to real-time data and parameters of function blocks; the use of adapter interfaces to implement object oriented concepts; initialization algorithms in function block networks; and the implementation of ECCs for a simplified motor control of hypothetical VCRs. Additionally the impacts of the mapping concerning the communication function blocks was explained, as well as the device management by management applications and its function blocks, and the principle of the device manager function block (DEV_MGR).  Part 4: Rules for compliance profiles  IEC 61499-4 describes the rules that a system, device or software tool must follow to be compliant to IEC 61499. These rules are related to interoperability, portability and configuration. Two devices are interoperable if they can work together to provide the functionality specified by a system configuration. Applications compliant to IEC 61499 have to be portable, which means that they can be exchanged between software tools of different vendors considering the requirements for software tools described within IEC 61499-2. Devices of any vendor have to be configurable by any IEC 61499 compliant software tool. Besides these general rules, IEC 61499-4 also defines the structure of compliance profiles. A compliance profile describes how a system conforms to the rules of the IEC 61499 standard. For example, the configurability of a device by a software tool is determined by the supported management commands. The XML exchange format which determines portability of IEC 61499 compliant applications is defined within part 2 and is completed by the compliance profile, for example by declaring the supported file name extensions for exchange of software library elements. The interoperability between devices of different vendors is defined by the layers of the OSI models. Also status outputs, IP addresses, port numbers as well as the data encoding of function blocks like PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE and CLIENT/SERVER, which are used for the communication between devices, have to be considered. HOLOBLOC, Inc. defines the \\"IEC 61499 compliance profile for feasibility demonstrations\\", which is for example supported by the IEC 61499 compliant software tools FBDK , 4diac IDE , and nxtSTUDIO.

Early in his career, Blackfan did work that identified the origin of cerebrospinal fluid. Biography Blackfan was born on September 9, 1883 in Cambridge, New York. He began his medical studies at the Albany Medical School of Union University, New York, graduating at the age of only 22. Initially, he returned home to join his father in general practice. He became bored with this, however, and four years later in 1909 he returned to Albany seeking fresh challenges. Encouraged by Richard Pearse, he decided to do some pediatric training in the Founding Hospital in Philadelphia. He did a residency under John Howland starting in 1911 at Washington University in St. Louis, and in 1913 Blackfan followed Howland to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Here he worked with Walter Dandy (described of the Dandy‚ÄìWalker syndrome) on internal hydrocephalus. Walker and Blackfan discovered where cerebrospinal fluid originated by tracking dye injected into the cerebral ventricle of a dog. Blackfan eventually became an associate professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1918, then moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and finally to Harvard University where he became director of clinical services at Children's Hospital and professor of pediatrics. He occupied this position until his death in 1941. At Harvard, his main interests were nutrition and hematology. He was Louis K. Diamond‚Äôs mentor, and together they wrote the first collection of photographs of microscopic appearances of the Blood in Childhood disease. In 1938, they described Diamond‚ÄìBlackfan syndrome. He also mentored Sidney Farber, the father of modern cancer chemotherapy. The Dana‚ÄìFarber Cancer Institute, next door to Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, is partially named after Sidney Farber. Blackfan died of lung cancer in 1941 at the height of his career.

It is related to the Varying Permeability Model. but is conceptually different in that it rejects the gel-bubble model of the varying permeability model. ‚Äì Bruce Wienke describes the differences between RGBM and VPM It is used in several dive computers, particularly those made by Suunto, Aqwary, Mares, HydroSpace Engineering, and Underwater Technologies Center. It is characterised by the following assumptions: blood flow (perfusion) provides a limit for tissue gas penetration by diffusion; an exponential distribution of sizes of bubble seeds is always present, with many more small seeds than large ones; bubbles are permeable to gas transfer across surface boundaries under all pressures; the haldanean tissue compartments range in half time from 1 to 720 minutes, depending on gas mixture. Some manufacturers such as Suunto have also devised approximations of Wienke's model. Suunto uses a modified haldanean nine-compartment model with the assumption of reduced off-gassing caused by bubbles. This implementation offers both a depth ceiling and a depth floor for the decompression stops. The former maximises tissue off-gassing and the latter minimises bubble growth. The model has been correlated and validated in a number of published articles using collected dive profile data. Description The model is based on the assumption that phase separation during decompression is random, yet highly probable, in body tissue, and that a bubble will continue to grow by acquiring gas from adjacent saturated tissue, at a rate depending on the local free/dissolved concentration gradient. Gas exchange mechanisms are fairly well understood in comparison with nucleation and stabilization mechanisms, which are computationally uncertainly defined. Nevertheless there is an opinion among some decompression researchers that the existing practices and studies on bubbles and nuclei provide useful information on bubble growth and elimination processes and the time scales involved. Wienke considers that the consistency between these practices and the underlying physical principles suggest directions for decompression modelling for algorithms beyond parameter fitting and extrapolation. He considers that the RGBM implements the theoretical model in these aspects and also supports the efficacy of recently developed safe diving practice due to its dual phase mechanics. These include: * reduced no-stop time limits; * safety stops in the 10-20 fsw depth zone; * ascent rates not exceeding 30 fsw per minute; * restricted repetitive exposures, particularly beyond 100 fsw, * restricted reverse profile and deep spike diving; * restricted multi day activity; * smooth coalescence of bounce and saturation limit points; * consistent diving protocols for altitude; * deep stops for decompression, extended range, and mixed gas diving with overall shorter decompression times, particularly in the shallow zone; * use of helium rich mixtures for technical diving, with shallower isobaric switches to nitrox than suggested by Haldanian strategies; * use of pure oxygen in the shallow zone to efficiently eliminate both dissolved and bubble phase inert gases.

More recently, \\"dissociative amnesia\\" has been defined as a dissociative disorder \\"characterized by retrospectively reported memory gaps. These gaps involve an inability to recall personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature.\\" In a change from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5, dissociative fugue is now subsumed under dissociative amnesia.American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing. The atypical clinical syndrome of the memory disorder (as opposed to organic amnesia) is that a person with psychogenic amnesia is profoundly unable to remember personal information about themselves; there is a lack of conscious self-knowledge which affects even simple self-knowledge, such as who they are. Psychogenic amnesia is distinguished from organic amnesia in that it is supposed to result from a nonorganic cause: no structural brain damage or brain lesion should be evident but some form of psychological stress should precipitate the amnesia, however psychogenic amnesia as a memory disorder is controversial. Definition Psychogenic amnesia is defined by the presence of retrograde amnesia (the inability to retrieve stored memories leading up to the onset of amnesia), and an absence of anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new long term memories). Access to episodic memory can be impeded, while the degree of impairment to short term memory, semantic memory and procedural memory is thought to vary among cases. If other memory processes are affected, they are usually much less severely affected than retrograde autobiographical memory, which is taken as the hallmark of psychogenic amnesia. However the wide variability of memory impairment among cases of psychogenic amnesia raises questions as to its true neuropsychological criteria, as despite intense study of a wide range of cases there is little consensus of which memory deficits are specific to psychogenic amnesia. Past literature has suggested psychogenic amnesia can be 'situation-specific' or 'global- transient', the former referring to memory loss for a particular incident, and the latter relating to large retrograde amnesic gaps of up to many years in personal identity. The most commonly cited examples of global-transient psychogenic amnesia are 'fugue states', of which there is a sudden retrograde loss of autobiographical memory resulting in impairment of personal identity and usually accompanied by a period of wandering. Suspected cases of psychogenic amnesia have been heavily reported throughout the literature since 1935 where it was reported by Abeles and Schilder. There are many clinical anecdotes of psychogenic or dissociative amnesia attributed to stressors ranging from cases of child sexual abuse to soldiers returning from combat. Cause Neurological cause of psychogenic amnesia is controversial. Even in cases of organic amnesia, where there is lesion or structural damage to the brain, caution must still be taken in defining causation, as only damage to areas of the brain crucial to memory processing is possible to result in memory impairment. Organic causes of amnesia can be difficult to detect, and often both organic cause and psychological triggers can be entangled. Failure to find an organic cause may result in the diagnosis that the amnesia is psychological, however it is possible that some organic causes may fall below a threshold of detection, while other neurological ails are thought to be unequivocally organic (such as a migraine) even though no functional damage is evident. Possible malingering must also be taken into account. Some researchers have cautioned against psychogenic amnesia becoming a 'wastebasket' diagnosis when organic amnesia is not apparent. Other researchers have hastened to defend the notion of psychogenic amnesia and its right not to be dismissed as a clinical disorder. Diagnoses of psychogenic amnesia have dropped since agreement in the field of transient global amnesia, suggesting some over diagnosis at least. Speculation also exists about psychogenic amnesia due to its similarities with 'pure retrograde amnesia', as both share similar retrograde loss of memory. Also, although no functional damage or brain lesions are evident in the case of pure retrograde amnesia, unlike psychogenic amnesia it is not thought that purely psychological or 'psychogenic triggers' are relevant to pure retrograde amnesia. Psychological triggers such as emotional stress are common in everyday life, yet pure retrograde amnesia is considered very rare. Also the potential for organic damage to fall below threshold of being identified does not necessarily mean it is not present, and it is highly likely that both psychological factors and organic cause exist in pure retrograde amnesia. = Comparison with organic amnesia = Psychogenic amnesia is supposed to differ from organic amnesia in a number of ways; one being that unlike organic amnesia, psychogenic amnesia is thought to occur when no structural damage to the brain or brain lesion is evident. Psychological triggers are instead considered as preceding psychogenic amnesia, and indeed many anecdotal case studies which are cited as evidence of psychogenic amnesia hail from traumatic experiences such as World War II. As aforementioned however, aetiology of psychogenic amnesia is controversial as causation is not always clear (see above paragraph), and both elements of psychological stress and organic amnesia may be present among cases. Often, but not necessarily, a premorbid history of psychiatric illness such as depression is thought to be present in conjunction to triggers of psychological stress. Lack of psychological evidence precipitating amnesia doesn't mean there isn't any, for example trauma during childhood has even been cited as triggering amnesia later in life, but such an argument runs the risk of psychogenic amnesia becoming an umbrella term for any amnesia of which there is no apparent organic cause. Due to organic amnesia often being difficult to detect, defining between organic and psychogenic amnesia is not easy and often context of precipitating experiences are considered (for example, if there has been drug abuse) as well as the symptomology the patient presents with. Psychogenic amnesia is supposed to differ from organic amnesia qualitatively in that retrograde loss of autobiographical memory while semantic memory remains intact is said to be specific of psychogenic amnesia. Another difference that has been cited between organic and psychogenic amnesia is the temporal gradient of retrograde loss of autobiographical memory. The temporal gradient of loss in most cases of organic amnesia is said to be steepest at its most recent premorbid period, whereas for psychogenic amnesia the temporal gradient of retrograde autobiographical memory loss is said to be quite consistently flat. Although there is much literature on psychogenic amnesia as dissimilar to organic amnesia, the distinction between neurological and psychological features is often difficult to discern and remains controversial. Diagnosis Functional assessment of brain activity can be assessed for psychogenic amnesia using imaging techniques such as fMRI, PET and EEG, in accordance with clinical data. Some research has suggested that organic and psychogenic amnesia to some extent share the involvement of the same structures of the temporo-frontal region in the brain. It has been suggested that deficits in episodic memory may be attributable to dysfunction in the limbic system, while self-identity deficits have been suggested as attributable to functional changes related to the posterior parietal cortex. To reiterate however, care must be taken when attempting to define causation as only ad hoc reasoning about the aetiology of psychogenic amnesia is possible, which means cause and consequence can be infeasible to untangle.  Treatments  Because psychogenic amnesia is defined by its lack of physical damage to the brain, treatment by physical methods is difficult. Nonetheless, distinguishing between organic and dissociative memory loss has been described as an essential first-step in effective treatments. Treatments in the past have attempted to alleve psychogenic amnesia by treating the mind itself, as guided by theories which range from notions such as 'betrayal theory' to account for memory loss attributed to protracted abuse by caregivers to the amnesia as a form of self-punishment in a Freudian sense, with the obliteration of personal identity as an alternative to suicide. Treatment attempts often have revolved around trying to discover what traumatic event had caused the amnesia, and drugs such as intravenously administered barbiturates (often thought of as 'truth serum') were popular as treatment for psychogenic amnesia during World War II; benzodiazepines may have been substituted later. 'Truth serum' drugs were thought to work by making a painful memory more tolerable when expressed through relieving the strength of an emotion attached to a memory. Under the influence of these 'truth' drugs the patient would more readily talk about what had occurred to them. However, information elicited from patients under the influence of drugs such as barbiturates would be a mixture of truth and fantasy, and was thus not regarded as scientific in gathering accurate evidence for past events. Often treatment was aimed at treating the patient as a whole, and probably varied in practice in different places. Hypnosis was also popular as a means for gaining information from people about their past experiences, but like 'truth' drugs really only served to lower the threshold of suggestibility so that the patient would speak easily but not necessarily truthfully. If no motive for the amnesia was immediately apparent, deeper motives were usually sought by questioning the patient more intensely, often in conjunction with hypnosis and 'truth' drugs. In many cases, however, patients were found to spontaneously recover from their amnesia on their own accord so no treatment was required.  Popular culture Psychogenic amnesia is a common fictional plot device in many films and books and other media. Examples include Shakespeare's King Lear, who experienced amnesia and madness following a betrayal by his daughters; and the title character Nina in Nicolas Dalayrac's 1786 opera. In the 2009 Televisa-produced telenovela Sortilegio, the main female protagonist (Jacqueline Bracamontes) is kidnapped and her memory is wiped using drugs.

He is a charter member of the Warriors Three, a trio of Asgardian adventurers and supporting cast of Thor. He is known for having multiple children. These include, but are not limited to, Hilde,Thor #350 (December 1984) Rolfe, and the adopted Midgardians Kevin and Mick.Thor #369 (July 1986) Ray Stevenson portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Thor (2011), Thor: The Dark World (2013), and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Publication history Volstagg first appeared in Journey into Mystery #119 (August, 1965), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. He is not taken from Norse (or any other) mythology but is an original creation, modeled on Shakespeare's Falstaff in character and name.Cooke, Jon B. (Editor); Thomas, Roy (Interviewer). \\"Stan the Man & Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas \\", TwoMorrows. reprinted from Comic Book Artist #2, accessed May 8, 2011. Fictional character biography =Early battles= Volstagg's origin story beyond being a member of the Asgardian race, a warrior and adventurer, and a friend of Thor has not been revealed. Volstagg is fairly advanced in age for an Asgardian, and it has been suggested that he was a highly respected and feared warrior in his prime. In a sense, Volstagg's entire career has been one long origin story. The character was first introduced in a \\"Tales of Asgard\\" filler in Journey Into Mystery #119 (August 1965), the magazine carrying Thor's Asgardian adventures.Journey Into Mystery #119 (August 1965) As originally envisioned by Jack Kirby, Volstagg was a huge, bumbling oaf much given to boasting and bragging: the last into battle and the first to claim victory (usually undeserved). Referring to himself as \\"The Lion of Asgard\\", he usually caused more problems than he solved and seemed totally unaware of the chaos that almost always followed in his wake. A flashback revealed in Captain Marvel #42 tells how a drunken Volstagg incurred the wrath of Odin by spilling the secrets of the first Frost Giants to a younger Thor.Captain Marvel #42 (May 2007) Strangely enough, he was considered a trusted and worthy comrade by his closest friends and allies, Fandral the Dashing, Hogun the Grim, and Thor. Another flashback showed Volstagg as a thin but muscular man, a great confidante of Thor himself. Hogun and Fandrall, practically strangers to him at the time, join with a quest on a dare to simply \\"pet\\" the Fenris wolf. The creature deals them a humiliating defeat. Advanced Idea Mechanics, having their own personal interest in Fenris, theorize it is this defeat that led to Volstagg's unhealthy eating habits.Warriors Three #1-4 (2010-2011) In his first comic book appearance, Volstagg joined with the Warriors Three in Thor's quest for the power that had cracked the Odinsword of Asgard. Though Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun had been recruited by Loki, they proved loyal to Thor when the time came. Volstagg's first battle involved him mainly falling onto his enemies.Journey Into Mystery #119 (Aug. 1965) Volstagg then helped repel the attack of the Flying Trolls of Thryheim, although he cowered for much of the fight.Journey Into Mystery #124-125 (Jan. - Feb. 1966) Volstagg helped defeat the forces of Harokin. Though this man was an avowed enemy of Asgard, he fought so well and nobly that Hela herself came to fetch him when a lifetime of wounds caught up with the warlord. Volstagg and the other Asgardians assisted as much as they could in Harokin's ride to Valhalla, for they all honored a warrior, even one in opposition.Thor #129-131 (June - Aug. 1966) Later, Odin send the Warriors Three and Thor to a long demolished land. Volstagg was lured into a trap by the dragon Fafnir who used an illusion. In another incident the four went to free Hogun's land from the murderous tyrant called Mogul of the Mystic Mountain; Volstagg's bumbling caused him to lose his companions and gain a new one. However, as soon as he gained a weapon that was capable of opposing Mogul, he rushed back to his friends to assist in the battle.Thor #137-145 (Feb. 1967 - Oct. 1967) In another flashback appearance, Volstagg mistook a mystical portal for a warming fire and literally fell into it. A rescue mission causes a destructive battle which then gives the Great Sphinx of Giza its unique face.Thor: The Truth Of History One-Shot (Dec. 2008) =As regular cast member= As the Warriors Three made increasingly frequent appearances in The Mighty Thor and other Marvel titles, a slightly more heroic side to his personality began to emerge. In Tales To Astonish #101, Volstagg squared-off with The Incredible Hulk for two panels (before being dumped contemptuously in a roadside ditch by the green-skinned behemoth);Tales to Astonish #101 (Mar. 1968) Volstagg helped defend Asgard against the demonic Mangog (a creature possessed of the power of a \\"billion billion\\" beings)Thor #155-157 (Aug. - Oct. 1968) and in Thor #164, the Lion of Asgard rushed through a tunnel to battle Mangog but was prevented when the passage proved too narrow to accommodate his considerable girth.Thor #164 (May 1969) During a trip to Hades to rescue his comrade-in-arms Thor, Volstagg offered to battle Mephisto in return for his friend's soul (despite being aware that the God of Thunder had already bested the Lord of Hell in fair combat some time previously). Ultimately, he helped Thor escape Mephisto.Thor #180-181 (Sept. - Oct. 1970) A real change to Volstagg's character came in the early seventies, when Thor and the Warriors Three were battling the interstellar parasite Ego- Prime in the streets of New York City: hiding behind a festering heap of garbage, Volstagg saw a group of extraterrestrial monstrosities preparing to devour a little girl, a sight which drove him to a remarkable (for him) display of courage and resolution. Despite his obvious terror, the Volumous One struck the creatures down with his bare hands and carried the child to safety (it would be revealed much later that Volstagg was himself a family man and would never stand to see an innocent child harmed in any way).Thor #202-205 (Aug. - Nov. 1972) =Under Walt Simonson= Following a brief hiatus towards the end of the seventies, Volstagg underwent a renaissance of sorts when Walt Simonson took over The Mighty Thor in 1982. Reaching back to Kirby's initial concept, Simonson redefines Volstagg as a big, likeable bear of a man, a friend to all with a song in their heart (and a glass in their hand). A good-natured old warrior somewhat past his prime, Volstagg is still held in high regard by his comrades, if only for his amusing company and unparalleled drinking ability. Simonson also added another dimension previously unseen in his earlier incarnations ‚Äî a household full of children. This updated persona becomes a crucial plot device in several of Simonson's classic story arcs: when Balder the Brave returns broken and hopeless from the land of the dead, Volstagg takes the fallen warrior under his wing, introducing him to the twin joys of gluttony and drunkenness.Thor Vol. 1 #338 (December 1983) When Surtur the fire demon rouses his forces to attack Earth, the Warriors Three are tasked by Odin to gather all the soldiers at his command. It is noted that such a task makes even Volstagg quiet. Later, during the battle proper in Manhattan, his boasting returns but his skill for battle is ever- present.Avengers #249 (Nov. 1984)Thor #350-352 (Dec. 1984 - Feb. 1985) The temptations of Earth do compel him to stay behind but Hogun stops this; he shoots Volstagg in the backside with approximately a dozen Migdardian tranquilizer darts. This is enough to stun and confuse the warrior.\\"Power Pack\\" #15 (October 1985) In a later plotline, when Thor's actions indirectly orphan two humans (Kevin and Mick), he takes them to Asgard and places them under Volstagg's care.Thor Vol. 1 #371-372 =New Mutants= Volstagg and his family have also encountered the New Mutants. During the group's first trip to Asgard, Volstagg makes friends with Roberto DaCosta, aka Sunspot, challenging him to feats of strength, including arm-wrestling and the lifting of Volstagg himself.New Mutants Special Edition #1 (Dec. 1985) In the group's second visit, Volstagg's children encounter Boom Boom, Hrimhari and Warlock, who were on the run from Hela's forces. Hela herself is currently following through with a plan to kill Odin and conquer Asgard. The children switch places with the group so as to emphasize to their elders, when they return, of the seriousness of the situation. They tell the heroes of Tiwaz, a powerful sorcerer who might help them in the fight. Hrimhari, wolf-prince of a far-away tribe of wolf-people, tells the children that tales of Volstagg's children were told to his people and it was an honor to be in their debt. Boom Boom, Warlock and Hrimhari rescue the Warriors Three from being slain by Queen Ula and her hive. The sheer girth of Volstagg is enough to delay the plans but Tiwaz provides a magical spell to temporarily shrink the enormous warrior. The Warriors Three, various Asgardians and even Queen Ula's troops join with the New Mutants; their efforts stop Hela from killing Odin.New Mutants #83-87 (Dec. 1989 - Mar. 1990) Volstagg is later overcome by a mystery plague.Thor #377-378 (Mar. - Apr. 1987) He then helped defend Asgard against the forces of Seth.Thor #393 (July 1988) He went on a quest with Thor to seek Ulagg.Thor #404-406 (June - Aug. 1989) He helped the Avengers battle Blastaar.Avengers #310 (Nov. 1989) Volsagg then battled Ymir and Surtur.Thor #421-426 (Aug. - Nov. 1990) He also attempted to prevent the second Thor (Eric Masterson) from entering Asgard.Thor #434 (July 1991) Soon after this point, when Odin is awake and aware, his mind becomes overtaken by the influence of Loki. Persecuted, the Warriors Three are forced to go on the run, gaining a new ally in the form of a young palace guardsman named Arko.Thor #453-455 (Nov.-Dec. 1992) After this is cleared up, the trio and Thor are involved in the dishonorable death of a giant's son. To redeem themselves, they set out on an adventure involving multiple heroic efforts. Volstagg suffers greatly over the course of this quest.\\"Thor: Blood Oath\\" #1-6 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006) =Volstagg's role= Volstagg was used primarily as comedy relief in the same way Falstaff, who Volstagg was modeled on, was comedy relief in Shakespeare's Henry IV. Stan Lee admitted his comics were inspired by Shakespeare, his Asgardians speaking in an English halfway between Shakespeare and the King James Bible. Volstagg's name is derived from Falstaff and the Volsunga Saga of Norse mythology. Volstagg, like Falstaff, is fat, vain, boastful, and cowardly, but also boon companion to the prince (Hal or Thor). He seems to know more about raising a mug (his favorite weapon, evidently) than raising a sword (of which he actually knew very little). Ironically, whenever his courage fails (at the slightest sign of danger), Volstagg's innate clumsiness would somehow seize victory from the jaws of defeat. In a typically Kirbyesque touch, Volstagg inadvertently saves his companions' lives on at least two occasions by stumbling onto the one weapon capable of saving the day (and later claiming that his initial cowardly retreat was all part of a vast master plan). There have been at least two sub stories about Volstagg's past that presented him as exceptionally well built and a capable warrior. On the other hand, in the Thor: Son of Asgard series (confirmed to be canonical from Official Handbook files of Asgardians), Volstagg is depicted as obese and cowardly even as a young man.Thor: Son of Asgard #7 (Oct. 2004) Oddly enough, while apparently somewhat older than Thor, he does not seem to be considerably older. It has also been hinted at on numerous occasions that he ceased his full-time warrior's life to be a husband and father. =Ragnarok and rebirth= Eventually, Loki brings about Ragnarok. The initial attack destroys the realm of the dwarves. The Warriors Three escape to Alfheim, home of the light elves. They bring Sif, who had lost an arm. Naglfar, a flying ship made from the fingernails of the dead, follows and rains arrows. Fandral and Hogun are lost. Sif, confused and disoriented, escapes. Volstagg makes a home in a statue of Frigg. He buries all he can and burns the bodies of the rest. His trials make him lose considerable weight. He re-unites with Thor, who talks him out of his despair and gives him the uru-spawned hammer of Geirrodur, king of the trolls.Thor #82 (2004) Thor had met the troll in battle and slain him, taking his weapon. Loki had, weeks ago, used the mold that made Thor's hammer and created many more similar weapons. Volstagg later is granted a second of these weapons, one used by Ulik, another vanquished enemy. The final battle of Ragnarok takes place in Vanaheim. There, Volstagg fights with the last of the Asgardian defenders. Surtur, freed by Thor to grant his people a meaningful final death, leads the charge. A soldier of Surtur spears Volstagg from behind while feet away, Sif is pierced by arrows and dies as well.Thor vol. 2, #80-85 (Aug. - Dec. 2004) As with all Asgardians, he has returned, this time to Midgard, where a new version of Asgard has arisen in Oklahoma. All the Warriors Three were in the forms of three soldiers in Africa, and are the second group to be reborn.Thor vol. 3, #4 (Dec. 2007) During the 'Secret Invasion' crossover, Asgard is threatened by various powered Skrulls. Volstagg is essential in distracting the Super-Skrull sent to destroy Asgard; the aliens are defeated.Secret Invasion: Thor #1-3 (Oct. - Dec. 2008) =Siege= Volstagg is later responsible for setting events in motion that would allow the Siege of Asgard to occur, after he heads to Chicago seeking to have adventures like those of Thor. He stops a robbery but causes a lot of damage. He is attacked by the U-Foes (who were operating under orders of Norman Osborn and Loki). The incident destroys Soldier Field in Chicago, killing many. However, Volstagg was framed, making it seem as if his incompetence killed innocents.Siege #1 (Mar. 2010) Ben Urich and Will Stern, reporters from New York and Chicago, later encounter Volstagg who is returning to Asgard to turn himself in after what happened at Soldier Field. The two realize Osborn is using Volstagg to better himself in the public opinion. They befriend Volstagg, who allows them to travel with him to Asgard for a fresh perspective on the situation.Siege: Embedded #1 (Mar. 2010) Ben Urich, Will Stern and Volstagg reach a roadblock as they approach Broxton, Oklahoma and are spotted in their news van by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents, a group controlled by Osborn. Volstagg exits the van and engages the agents directly while Ben and Will speed off but are caught only moments later.Siege: Embedded #2 (Apr. 2010) In the Broxton jail, Volstagg is speaking to the sheriff and his deputy as the news reports on the attack on Asgard, showing footage of Thor being beaten down. Realizing that what's going on is wrong, the sheriff releases Volstagg so that he can go help defend his home. Volstagg stops though, when he realizes all the lies that are being spread about him and the other Asgardians. The sheriff sets him up in front of a webcam, and Volstagg sends out a video to the world about what really happened in Chicago. Word quickly spreads, and people everywhere are beginning to question Norman Osborn and H.A.M.M.E.R.'s attack on Asgard. As Volstagg is leaving the police station, Thor lands in front of him and smacks him to the ground. Volstagg realizes that this is not the true Thor; this is the clone, Ragnarok.Thor #607 (Apr. 2010) He battles the clone in a deserted field to avoid more damage but is beaten.Thor #608 (May 2010) Ben and Will meet up with Volstagg again, and all three assist injured Asgardians after the city has fallen. Finally when Osborn tries to escape after the events, Volstagg stops him with a knockout blow. Volstagg later spends time assisting in rebuilding Soldier Field.Siege #4 (June 2010)Siege: Embedded #4 (July 2010) When Odin plans to destroy the Earth to save the rest of the known Worlds from the Fear Serpent, Volstagg is forced to be one of men keeping Thor under control.Fear Itself #2 (2011) Odin changes his plans, leading an army to Midgard to slay the Serpent. The Warriors Three, at the forefront, are just in time to see the Serpent and Thor slay each other in battle.Fear Itself #7 (Dec. 2011) =Rebuilding= In Journey Into Mystery, Volstagg protects the de-aged Loki despite his misgivings about his former foe. He often regrets his actions but reminds himself he took an oath.Journey Into Mystery #622-625 (2011) His family is reestablished as existing during Fear Itself.The Mighty Thor #8 (Jan 1. 2012) Volstagg takes up liaison duties between Broxton, Oklahoma and his reformed homeland, now called Asgardia and ruled by the All-Mother.The Mighty Thor Vol. 1 #10 (Jan. 25 2012) Volstagg's home life, and his daughter Hilde, are featured in a debacle that lets Fenris loose during the middle of the night. To avoid a beating, Fenris promises to go under his magical leash Gliepnir if Hilde brings him a Golden Apple of Idunn.Journey Into Mystery #651 (2013) =Against Surtur= The ancient fire demon Surtur uses the grudges the Vanaheim have against Asgard to inflame a war that affects the nine-realms. When Volstagg thinks Loki is part of it, a suggestion to imprison the trickster leads Thor to battle the Warriors Three. The All-Mother's connection to the Vanaheim causes them to lose their rulership of Asgard and Volstagg becomes the new ruler. He leads a war through much of the nine realms. He tries to give a pardon to the All-Mother but they refuse, saying the people's trust do not match Volstagg's. Later, Surtur's forces are defeated thanks to Loki and Volstagg steps down to rule only over his family once again.\\"Everything Burns\\" Later, the focus of Journey Into Mystery changes from Loki to Sif. The Surtur war is shown to have almost taken Volstagg's son Arnor when Asgardia's library burns. Sif saves him.Journey Into Mystery #646 (Jan 2013) Later, Volstagg's pacifist daughter is struck by the broken sword of Fandral the Dashing thrown by an angry Sif. The various lands in the nine realms reorganize themselves with the Congress of Worlds. Volstagg becomes Asgard's senator to this grouping.Thor: God Of Thunder #12 (November 2013) When Thor becomes unable to move his hammer from the moon, he encourages Volstagg (and others) to lift it. Volstagg tries and is unable to.Thor #1 (2014) One of Volstagg's many duties in the new political landscape of Asgard is supervising Jane Foster, as she needs a companion on her chemotherapy visits.The Mighty Thor #1 (2016) =Becoming War Thor= Volstagg as War Thor on the cover of The Mighty Thor #20 (June 2017). Art by Russell Dauterman, in homage to 1983's The Mighty Thor #337, which originally featured Beta Ray Bill. As tensions among the Nine Realms escalate due to the return of Cul and the shifting alliances of the Elves, Volstagg, stricken with grief and rage after he witnessed the deaths of several children in a confrontation with Surtur's fire-demons, travels to the remains of ancient Asgard where he claims the discarded hammer of the deceased Ultimate Thor. This transforms him into the \\"War Thor.\\"The Mighty Thor #20 (2016) Driven by the power of this hammer, Volstagg mounted an assault on Muspelheim, but when he began to threaten children, Jane Foster confronted her old friend to convince him to stand down, although it took Odinson to make Volstagg realize that his actions were only provoking further conflict rather than ending it.The Mighty Thor #23 (2017) Powers and abilities Volstagg possesses a number of superhuman attributes conventionally possessed by all Asgardians. Volstagg possesses superhuman strength. While he is still stronger than most Asgardian males, he is no longer in his physical prime. Aside from his strength, some of Volstagg's other physical capabilities have decreased, mostly due to his obesity. Volstagg's speed, stamina, and agility are now inferior to that of the majority of his race. Volstagg is extremely long lived, although not truly immortal, and ages much slower than a human being. The tissues of his body are also superhumanly resistant to physical injury. It is possible to injure him but his life-force enables him to recover with superhuman speed and efficiency. Volstagg has demonstrated the ability to increase his mass to make himself nearly unmovable.New Mutants Special Edition #1 In a number of stories, Volstagg is represented as an excellent overall battlefield warrior and is highly proficient in all Asgardian weapons; an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, swordsman, horseman, and archer, a superb pugilist and a master of the quarterstaff. Volstagg's battle prowess is somewhat limited by his advanced age and tremendous girth. However, Volstagg is still capable of using his sheer bulk to his advantage in combat situations. He can consume vast quantities of food and drink. Other versions =Earth X= In the alternate Earth X reality, the Asgardians were actually aliens that were manipulated by the Celestials into believing they were the Gods of Norse myth. When the lie was revealed, \\"Volstagg\\" and the other Asgardians briefly resumed their alien form, but later returned to their Asgardian forms.Earth X #12 (Apr. 2000) Volstagg appeared again to deny Doctor Strange's army passage to Lord Odin's castle. This attempt failed and all of the Warriors Three die. However this was used as a larger plan for Thor to eliminate the realm of Hel itself.Paradise X: Xen (July 2002) =Marvel Adventures= The Warriors Three appear briefly in the Marvel Adventures universe in a supporting capacity.Marvel Adventures: Super Heroes vol. 2, #5 (Nov. 2010) They were the first Asgardians to assist the Avengers in driving Malekith and his forces out of Asgard.Marvel Adventures: The Avengers Vol 1 #15 (October, 2007) =Marvel Zombies= In the Marvel Zombies alternate universe, many heroes attend Nick Fury's briefing on how to deal with the zombie plague, including Volstagg.Marvel Zombies: Dead Days #1 (July 2007) =MC2= An older version of Volstagg has appeared in the alternate future series called Last Planet Standing. =Mutant X= Volstagg was one of many who fought the Beyonder and died in the Mutant X universe.Mutant X Annual #2001 (May 2001) =Thor: The Mighty Avenger= A young Thor meets the Warriors Three in Thor: The Mighty Avenger. The trio had arrived on Midgard to check in on Thor's mission, only to find out the warrior had no idea what that mission was. Unwilling to tell Thor what it was, the group go out drinking in Europe. There they meet, fight and then befriend Captain Britain.Thor: The Mighty Avenger #4 (Nov. 2010) =Ultimate Marvel= Volstagg the Voluminous briefly appears in Ultimates 2 #1, meeting with Thor at the Terrace in the Sky restaurant in Morningside Heights. He is there to warn Thor of Loki's plot against him. None of the other patrons can see Volstagg, and it was unclear at the time whether this is due to Loki's interference or whether Volstagg is merely a delusion of Thor. During the discussion, Volstagg states that Loki is rewriting reality even as they speak; Loki then shows up in one panel as one of the restaurant patrons. At the end of Ultimates 2, Thor was proven to be a god and it is inferred that Loki was indeed interfering.Ultimates 2 #1-13 Volstagg along with the Warrior's Three, also appear in Ultimate Comics: Thor. At first, they were sparring partners to Loki, Thor and Balder. In this continuity Volstagg holds a position of authority concerning the wall surrounding Asgard itself. Later, the trio seemingly sacrificed themselves in a delaying attack against Frost Giants and mystically charged Nazis.Ultimate Comics: Thor #1-4 (2010) Volstagg, and most Asgardians are slain off-panel by the 'Children', a futuristic society led by a maddened Reed Richards.Ultimate Comics #2 (November 2011) In other media =Television= * Volstagg made a cameo appearance on the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends episode \\"The Vengeance of Loki!\\". * Volstagg (alongside the other Warriors Three members) appears in The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Ted Biaselli.

Hutspot also found in Indonesian cuisine due to their colonial ties. History of the dish According to legend, the recipe came from the cooked potato bits left behind by hastily departing Spanish soldiers during their Siege of Leiden in 1574 during the Eighty Years' War, when the liberators breached the dikes of the lower lying polders surrounding the city. This flooded all the fields around the city with about a foot of water. As there were few, if any, high points, the Spanish soldiers camping in the fields were essentially flushed out. The anniversary of this event, known as Leidens Ontzet, is still celebrated every October 3 in Leiden and by Dutch expatriates the world over. Traditionally, the celebration includes consumption of a lot of hutspot. Hutspot is normally cooked with ' in the same vessel. Klapstuk is a cut of beef from the rib section. It is marbled with fat and responds well to slow cooking in hutspot. If klapstuk is not available, then smoked bacon is commonly substituted. The carrots used are generally of the type known as winterpeen (winter carrots), which give the dish its distinctive flavour ordinary carrots cannot match. The first European record of the potato is as late as 1537, by the Spanish conquistador Juan de Castellanos, and it spread quite slowly throughout Europe from thereon. So the original legend likely refers to what the Dutch call a 'sweet potato' or pastinaak which is a parsnip; this vegetable played a similar role in Dutch cuisine prior to the use of the potato as a staple food. The term hutspot (which can be roughly translated as \\"shaken pot\\") is similar to the English term hotchpot and Middle French hochepot, both of which used to identify a type of meat-and-barley stew that became synonymous with a confused jumble of mixture, later referred to as 'hotchpotch' or 'hodge-podge'. In noting the etymological connection, the Oxford English Dictionary records 'hochepot' as a culinary term from 1440, more than a century before the Siege of Leiden. In Melibeus (c1386), Chaucer wrote, \\"»úe haue cast alle here wordes in an hochepoche\\", but that early use probably referred to its legal sense in English law (recorded from 1292) as a blending of properties. Later uses certainly referred to its culinary sense. Similar foods Related Dutch mashed potato dishes such as stamppot include boerenkool (\\"farmers' cabbage\\" or kale), andijvie (endive), spruitjes (brussels sprouts) and/or zuurkool (sauerkraut), generally with some rookworst (smoked sausage) or smoked bacon. The chunky texture of the dish distinguishes it from other more smoothly pureed potato-based dishes. More a hearty meal than a side dish, hutspot is very popular during Dutch winters. The Swedish dish rotmos ‚Äì \\"root mash\\" ‚Äì is similar, save for the onions which are substituted with swede (k√•lrot). Potch, a traditional Welsh accompaniment to meat dishes, is likewise made with mashed potato, carrot, swede, parsnip and sometimes other root vegetables. Despite the similar name, it is a distinct dish from the Flemish hutsepot, a meat stew with unmashed vegetables.

Prior to 2006, the area currently administered by Sun West included six school divisions. These were Kindersley, Rosetown, Eston-Elrose, Outlook, Davidson and Biggar School Divisions. on January 1, 2006, these six legacy divisions were combined to form the Sun West School Division as part of the provincial government's re-structuring of rural school divisions in Saskatchewan. The Sun West Division office is located in Rosetown, Saskatchewan at 501-1st Street West.http://www.sunwestsd.ca The School Division administers 39 schools; of these 14 are Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools, 7 are elementary schools, 3 are high schools and 15 are Hutterite Colony Schools.

The reservoir was created by the Amistad Dam (Presa de la Amistad in Spanish), completed in 1969, located on the Rio Grande at the United States-Mexico border across from the city of Ciudad Acu√±a in the Mexican state of Coahuila. Amistad, Spanish for \\"friendship,\\" refers broadly to the close relationship and shared history between Ciudad Acu√±a and Del Rio. Recreational activities The lake given its location is the backdrop for year-round, water-based recreation opportunities, including boating, fishing, swimming, scuba diving and water-skiing. Houseboats and other boating equipment can be rented from the park unit's concessionaires. Amistad National Recreation Area in addition provides opportunities for picnicking, hiking, camping and hunting. The area is rich in archeology and rock art, and contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. In the fall, monarch butterflies by the thousands pass through the area during their 3,000 mile (4,800 km) migration from southern Canada to central Mexico. Unlike most national parks, there are opportunities for hunting as provided for under state and federal law at Amistad given its status as a recreation area. Bow-hunting for white-tailed deer, javelina, turkey, rabbit, mouflon sheep, aoudad sheep, blackbuck antelope and feral hog is permitted during certain times of the year in prescribed hunt areas. Though rifles and handguns are not permitted, shotguns may be used to hunt dove, quail, duck and rabbit in accordance with relevant regulations. Elite scuba divers have begun to explore the system of deep underwater caves beneath the surface of the reservoir. The dive requires exotic gas mixes, pre-placement of gas cylinders, and extensive decompression times at depth. These caves are considered hazardous and should not be attempted by anyone without extensive training and preparation. Administrative history The National Park Service initially managed the site as the Amistad Recreation Area under a cooperative agreement with the International Boundary and Water Commission effective November 11, 1965. Amistad was reauthorized as a national recreation area and NPS park unit on November 28, 1990.

The lake is bounded by Val Verde County on the United States side of the international border and by the state of Coahuila on the Mexican side of the border; the American shoreline forms the Amistad National Recreation Area. The reservoir was formed in 1969 by the construction of Amistad Dam. The dam and lake are managed jointly by the governments of the United States and Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission. The name of the dam and lake is the Spanish word for \\"friendship\\". The reservoir is also known as Lake Amistad. Hydrology Amistad Reservoir is part of the Rio Grande, which forms its principal inflow at its northwestern end. The other major inflow is the Devils River, which enters from the north. The reservoir occupies a series of meanders between the two rivers; its outflow passes through Amistad Dam on the lake's southern side, from which the Rio Grande continues southeastward toward the Gulf of Mexico. Since it is filled by the Rio Grande (and its tributaries, the Rio Conchos and Pecos River), Amistad's drainage basin includes a vast area of West Texas, central New Mexico, southern Colorado, southeastern Chihuahua, and northern Coahuila. Fish and plant life Amistad Reservoir is stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish found in Amistad Reservoir include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, Guadalupe bass, and catfish. Substantial aquatic vegetation grows in the lake, primarily hydrilla. The Amistad gambusia, a fish species endemic to the area, was eliminated in the wild when the filling of the reservoir in 1969 submerged Goodenough Spring, its only known habitat, under approximately of water. Two captive populations didn't survive, and the fish was extinct by 1987. History The area now covered by the reservoir was long inhabited by Indigenous Americans, who sheltered in caves along the rivers and left numerous cave paintings. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, American pioneers such as John Coffee Hays travelled through the area in developing a reliable road from San Antonio to El Paso. A 1944 treaty between the United States and Mexico proposed the construction of a major dam and reservoir on the Rio Grande to provide flood control, water conservation, irrigation, hydroelectric power, and recreation to the area. Amistad Dam's construction began in December 1964 and was completed in November 1969, after which the reservoir was filled, flooding a series of valleys around the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Devils River. The dam and the reservoir are managed by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which was established in 1889 by the governments of the United States and Mexico to maintain the border, allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation. Recreational uses Rocky beach on Lake Amistad west of Del Rio, Texas During the construction of the dam, the land around the American shore of the coming reservoir was designated as the Amistad National Recreation Area. The lake provides year-round, water- based recreation opportunities, including boating, fishing, swimming, scuba diving and water-skiing, as well as other recreational opportunities for picnicking, camping, and hunting. The area is rich in archaeology and rock art, and contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. The lake is home to yearly nationally-televised fishing tournaments. It is also near the flight path of USAF trainers.

It first aired on 2 December 1963, during the first season. Introduction A group of space troopers are psychologically tortured in an alien prisoner-of- war camp. Opening narration Plot In response to an unprovoked nuclear attack from the planet Ebon, a group of soldiers‚Äîrepresenting Unified Earth‚Äîis sent to fight the enemy on their alien world. Captured en route to Ebon, the soldiers undergo physical and psychological torture and interrogation at the hands of the Ebonites, who possess the ability to control the five senses. The prisoners become suspicious of each other when their captors claim they have received cooperation in obtaining military secrets, which is further complicated by each one's past and ethnic origins, along with the unexpected appearance of high-ranking Earth officers among the hostile aliens. The earthmen are subjected to various interactive images of relatives and friends, which have been implanted in their minds during questioning, allowing them to feel a false sense of security, or to instill deeply hidden emotional conflicts. In the end, it is revealed that all of this is but a military \\"game\\", organized by the Earth officers to test their troops' loyalty and valor under intense interrogation and psychological stress. The Earth-Ebon war itself is a fake, as the Ebonites' initial bombardment was unintentional. Unexpected accidents and deaths having occurred during the test, the Ebonites‚Äîwho are, actually, a peaceful and honorable alien civilization‚Äîeventually ask for such an immoral and inhuman experimentation to end at once; nonetheless, they fail to prevent one last man from being killed, which was one of the conspiring Earth officers thought to be an illusion created by the Ebonites to trick the captives into revealing more information.

According to his description, this period was along with descend of Hikmah; he also complaint of his period for the sake of lacking knowledge and philosophy. This kind of entrance to subject, was common among Islamic philosophers. There was an intellectual and spiritual turmoil in Qajar period. In fact in this period, Iranian encountered with new European thought and revival of traditional thinking; also in this period we can see the diverse divisions in beliefs like Bahaei, Babi, shaykhi and at the same time weakness and disappearance of Shiite. Molla Hadi counted as one of the four prominent masters of Tehran philosophical school. He was along with Aqa ‚ÄòAli Mudarris, Aqa Muhammad Riza Qumshihi, Mirza Abul Hasan Jelveh. Life He was born in Sabzevar, Iran to a family of land-owning merchants. His formal education started at a young age under his cousin, Molla Hosayn Sabzavari, and he wrote a small treatise at the age of seven. His father died when he was seven or eight years old and his uncle Molla ·∏§osayn Sabzavari, became his caretaker. When he reached the age of ten, he was taken by his cousin to Mashhad. There, he resided in the Hajj Hasan madrasa near the mausoleum of Imam Reza, where he studied Arabic, Islamic Jurisprudence, logic, and the principles of religion and law with Molla Hosay for a period of ten years. When he turned twenty, he returned to his hometown of Sabzavar. From there, he prepared his plans for the Hajj and set out in the direction of Isfahan. During this period, Isfahan was an important intellectual center of Iran, where philosophy and intellectual mysticism ('Erfan) flourished. Among the important masters of these tradition at the time, the names of MollƒÅ  øAli Nuri (died 1830‚Äì31) and MollƒÅ EsmƒÅ øil E·π£fahƒÅni, a student of Nuri, were prominent. They taught Islamic philosophy, mostly of Sadr al-Din Shirazi and his school. He remained in Isfahan for around eight or nine years, where he studied under these two undisputed masters of Mulla Sadra's school of philosophy. He concentrated on the main works of Mulla Sadra, such as the Asfar and Al-Shawahed al-Robubiya. Simultaneously, he also studied Islamic jurisprudence with Aqa Mohammad 'Ali Najafi, one of the major Shia scholars of Isfahan. In Isfahan, Sabzevari lived a life of pietry despite having received a substantial inheritance. According to the orientalist Edward Browne, ‚Äúhe used to take pains to discover which of the students stood most in need of pecuniary help, and would then secretly place sums of money in their room during their absence, without leaving any clue that would lead to the identification of the donor. In this way he is said to have expended no less than 100,000 tum√°ns (about 30,000 Pounds Sterling), while he was in Isfahan, leaving himself only so much as he deemed necessary for his own maintenance‚Äù. In In 1826‚Äì27, Sabzavari returned to Mashhad. There he began to teach in the HƒÅjj Hasan madrasa although the scholars in Mashhad did not have the same interest in philosophy as Isfahan. The atmosphere of Mashhad was not as open as Isfahan for the pursuit of intellectual sciences. However, he continued to teach both the transmitted science as well as the intellectual sciences. He thought the intellectual sciences based on his work al-Manzuma, which he must have composed in Isfahan. His commentary on this important work of his however was completed in 1845. In 1831‚Äì32, he set out for Sabzavar where he made preparation for the Hajj. He left for Mecca in 1832‚Äì33 where he performed the rites of the pilgrimage. He returned to Iran in 1834‚Äì35 during the interval of the death of Fath Ali Shah Qajar. During this period of anarchy, traveling within Iran had become dangerous. Having lost his wife in Hajj, he settled in Kerman while waiting for calmer conditions to return to Khorasan. During the year he spent in Kerman, he was engaged in asceticism while agreeing to sweep the religious school for its keeper who provided him a room to live in. He married the keeper's daughter that year who was later to accompany him to Sabzavar. At this time, no one knew his real identity and degree of knowledge. In 1836‚Äì37, Sabzavari set to Sabzavar and established a center for the study of Islamic philosophy and gnosis. The school he established rivaled with the schools of Tehran and Isfahan due to his personality. For a period of 10 months, he also taught in Mashhad. However, the rest of time was spent in Sabzevar where he made the Fasihiya school the center of teaching. This school became known as Madrasa-ye ·∏§ƒÅji, where part of it still survives till this day. Scholars and students began to flock from all over Persia, Iraq, Turkey, Caucasus, India and even Tibet. His name became widespread all over Iran so much so that in 1857‚Äì58, when Naser al-Din Shah Qajar made a pilgrimage to Mashhad, he stopped in Sabzavar and paid a visit to hakim Sabzavari. The Qajar King became very impressed by the philosopher and asked his royal photographer Aqa Reza 'Akkas-Bashi to photograph the hakim. The picture, which is widely available, is the oldest picture of an Islamic philosopher. The Qajar king also requested from him a book in Persian containing the complete theory and cycle of traditional philosophy. Sabzavari obliged and composed the two Persian books: the AsrƒÅral-·∏•ekam, which he dedicated to Naser al-Din Shah and also another book titled HedƒÅyat al-·π≠ƒÅlebin. Sabzavari died suddenly in 1872, probably as a result of heart failure. The date of his death is recorded in several chronographs, including the numerical value of the couplet ka namord zendatar shod (\\"He did not die but became more alive after his passing\\") which was composed by one of his students. Works Sabzavari wrote some fifty-two works of prose and poetry in both Arabic and Persian. He wrote the Asrar al- hikmah (\\"The Secrets of Wisdom\\"), which, together with his Arabic treatise Sharh-i manzumah (\\"A Treatise on Logic in Verse\\"), remains a basic text for the study of hikmat doctrines in Iran. Not limited to philosophy, he also wrote poetry under the name of Asrar and completed a commentary on the Masnavi of Jalal ad-Din ar-Rumi, the great mystic poet of Islam.\\"Sabzevari, Hajji Hadi.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 12 Jan. 2007 For philosophy in the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar (1848‚Äì1896), he was what Mulla Sadra had been in the reign of Shah Abbas I. He was also the faithful interpreter of Mulla Sadra and Transcendent Theosophy. He played a part in making Mulla Sadra the 'master thinker' of the Iranian philosophers. It could even be said that circumstances permitted him, to a greater extent than Mulla Sadra, to give free rein to his genius as a mystical theosopher, because there was greater freedom of self-expression during the Safavid epoch.Corbin (1993), p.358  Books  Sabzevari wrote numerous works in Persian and Arabic. He wrote works dealing with an array of subjects from prosody to logic to theology. However, the majority of his works deal with philosophy and mysticism. *≈†ar·∏• al-man·∫ìuma, is a work in Arabic also known as ·∏†orar al-farƒÅ æed. It is one of his more notable books which was completed around 1845. Till this day, it is still thought in religious seminaries in Iran with numerous later commentaries. The work is a versified summary and commentary of the transcendence philosophy of Mulla Sadra. *AsrƒÅr al-·∏•ekam fi‚Äôl-moftata·∏• wa‚Äôl-mo·∏µtatamM.

The book was completed in 1868 and it deals with concepts of illuminative wisdom (e≈°rƒÅq) and peripatetic philosophy, and is rich in intuitive and mystic insights. The gnosis of Sabzavari falls into three categories which are: (1) knowledge of God, consisting of knowledge of the beginning and knowledge of the end; (2) knowledge of one's self; (3) knowledge of God's commands, consisting of knowledge of every rule of divine law (≈°arƒ´ øa) and knowledge of the spiritual path (·π≠arƒ´qa). On the basis of this classification, the book is divided into two parts. Part I of the book consists of seven chapters: *proof of the Necessarily Existent (wƒÅ«∞eb al- wo«∞≈´d), *knowledge of God's attributes *God's actions *knowledge of one's self and psychology (ma øƒÅref-e nafs) *knowledge of man's origin and destination, *absolute prophethood *Imamate Part II comprises four chapters *ritual purity (·π≠ahƒÅra) *prayer (·π£alƒÅt) *alms *fasting (·π£ƒ´ƒÅm).

It became on March 4, 1909 by the 60th United States Congress, and it went into effect on July 1, 1909.Copyright Act of 1909 , Pub. L. 60-349, 35 Stat. 1075 (Mar. 4, 1909; repealed Jan. 1, 1978). The Act was repealed and superseded by the Copyright Act of 1976, but it remains effective for copyrighted works created before the Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect on January 1, 1978. It allowed for works to be copyrighted for a period of 28 years from the date of publication but extended the preexisting renewal term of 14 years (effective as of the Copyright Act of 1831) to 28 years, for a maximum of 56 years (in place of the former 42 years). Background Expansion of U.S. copyright law (Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for seventy years) Before the 1909 Act, the last major revision to United States copyright law was the 1790 Act. Methods of reproducing and duplicating works subject to copyright had significantly increased since the 1790 Act. President Theodore Roosevelt expressed the need for a complete revision of copyright law as opposed to amendments, saying in a message to Congress in December 1905, \\"Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in definition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit provision for many articles which, under modern reproductive processes, are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the public; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible for the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.\\", The House Report on the Copyright Act of 1909. Under the 1909 Act, federal statutory copyright protection attached to original works only when those works were 1) published and 2) had a notice of copyright affixed. Thus, state copyright law governed protection for unpublished works, but published works, whether containing a notice of copyright or not, were governed exclusively by federal law. If no notice of copyright was affixed to a work and the work was \\"published\\" in a legal sense, the 1909 Act provided no copyright protection and the work became part of the public domain. In the report submitted by the House Committee on Patents, they designed the copyright law \\"not primarily for the benefit of the author, but primarily for the benefit of the public.\\", Notable Dates in American Copyright. The 1976 Act changed this result, providing that copyright protection attaches to works that are original and fixed in a tangible medium of expression, regardless of publication or affixation of notice. It also created (codified in Section 1(e)) the first compulsory mechanical license to allow anyone to make a mechanical reproduction (known today as a phonorecord) of a musical composition without the consent of the copyright owner provided that the person adhered to the provisions of the license. (Congress intended it to govern piano rolls.) In later practice, compulsory license made it possible to record and distribute a cover version of a hit song - once a recording had been released, and the copyright owner was served with a notice of intention to use - that directly competed with the original.  Case law  =White-Smith Music Publishing Company v. Apollo Company= In February 1908, the Supreme Court ruled that manufacturers of pianola music rolls were not required to pay royalties to composers, based on the holding that these music rolls were not copies of musical compositions within the meaning of copyright law because it was not \\"a written or printed record in intelligible notation.\\" This decision on sheet music was superseded by the Act. =F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc.= In 1952, the Supreme Court held that the Act gave trial judges significant freedom in imposing legal remedies to discourage copyright infringement. Under this ruling, judges could penalize copyright infringers with repaying profits or paying compensation for damages. If damages could not be determined, judges could levy statutory damages instead. =Herbert v. Shanley Co.= On January 22, 1917, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Holmes upheld the right for copyright owners to compensation for a public performance of a musical composition, even if there was no direct charge for admission. This ruling forced Shanley's Restaurant in New York to pay a fee to songwriter Victor Herbert for playing one of his songs on a player piano during dinner. This decision helped the ASCAP adopt the royalty-payment mechanism known as a \\"blanket license\\", which is still used today. Under a blanket license, signatory businesses such as restaurants have the right to play any composition of an ASCAP artist for an annual fee.http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ascap-is-founded Notable amendments =The Townsend Amendment of 1912= This amendment resulted in motion pictures being specifically added to the category of protected works. Prior to this amendment, United States copyright law did not protect nor register motion picture films. Instead, most motion picture filmmakers would register their work as a collection of still photographs. =The Act of March 28, 1914= This amendment amended section 12 of the Copyright Act of 1909, allowing foreign authors whose work had been published in a foreign country to submit only one copy of the best edition of their work, rather than the customary two. This helped ease the deposit requirements of foreign authors. =The Act of September 25, 1941= This amended section 8 of the Copyright Act of 1909 with the intention to preserve the right of authors during periods of emergency, and specifically for World War II. The purpose of this amendment was to prevent authors, copyright owners, or proprietors from losing the opportunity to acquire or preserve copyright protection for their works because of the disruption of communication or suspension of facilities where they could acquire copyright licenses because of the war.

Hogun is superhumanly strong, his strength being somewhat greater than that of the average Asgardian. Hogun is also extremely long lived, though not immortal, and ages at a pace much slower than humans. The tissues of his body are also more resilient than those of a human, rendering him much more resistant to physical injury. If he is injured, his body is able to heal itself with superhuman speed and efficiency. Hogun's superior musculature and metabolism grants him superhuman levels of stamina. Like all Asgardians, Hogun's bone, skin and muscle are much denser than that of a human, which helps to contribute to his superhuman strength and durability. Hogun is an excellent overall battlefield warrior, a superb hand-to-hand combatant and horseman. He is highly proficient in the use of all Asgardian weapons, and is a master of bludgeoning weapons, especially the mace. He is also sometimes armed with a sword. He has also demonstrated skill in the area of battlefield medicine and healing arts, though he makes no claim of being a healer of any real proficiency.

Osbert, Peter's father, was a minor Norman baron in the Roumois (the neighborhood of Rouen, the capital of Normandy). He held the tower and ville of Preaux as well as land at Darn√©tal. Osbert also owned a scattering of manors in England. Peter, as the second son of the sire de Preaux, had few prospects for a landed estate. He, along with his brothers John, William, and Enguerrand were part of the royal household from a very early age. Peter would serve in succession, Henry II, Richard I, and John of England. Peter and William were known throughout the tournament circuit of the day as fierce warriors and competent knights. Sometime prior to 1189 CE, Osbert had died. John, the eldest son succeeded him to the family barony. Crusade Peter and William accompanied King Richard on crusade in 1190. Peter was assigned the dignity of royal standard-bearer over the hereditary standard-bearer of England, Robert Trussebut. Peter and William were known to be with the King at Vezelay, Marseille, Sicily, the conquest of Cyprus, the Siege of Acre, the Battle of Arsuf, the march to Jaffa, the advance on Jerusalem, Darum, and last but not least, the Battle of Jaffa. After the truce had been established between Richard and Saladin, Peter was assigned an important mission with other household knights, including William des Roches and Gerard de Fournival. The crusading host had been permitted by the Muslims to complete the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Peter, and his band, had been sent ahead of the first battalion to obtain safe conducts. According to the chronicle of the crusade attributed to Geoffrey of Vinsauf, Peter had fallen asleep at one of the villages where he was to meet a Saracen embassy. The crusaders charged ahead without receiving their safe conducts. When Peter and company had awaken, they realized that they were already behind the Christian host. Peter made all haste to catch up. He was then reprimanded by the column's commander, the king's cousin, Andrew of Chauvigny. King Richard's last act prior to departing the Holy Land for Europe was to ransom Peter's brother, William. He had been captured by Saladin's forces a year prior while personally keeping the King from being captured. William and Peter returned to Normandy in late 1192. France Peter served King Richard throughout his wars against Philip II of France, 1194‚Äì1199. During the last years of Angevin rule in Normandy 1202‚Äì1204, John of England made both Peter and William important territorial military governors in Normandy. Peter was made Governor of the Channel Islands, King John granting total lordship of the islands to Peter by 1203. and William was made bailiff of the Oximin. By December 1203, King John left an already invaded Normandy, never to return. John of Preaux sided at this point with Philip of France. King John had left the defense of the capital with Peter as commander. His force included Henri d'Estouteville, Robert d'Esneval, Richard de Villequier, Thomas de Pavilly, Peter de Hotot and many knights of Robert, count of Alen√ßon who did not follow their lord into his treason against King John. By spring of 1204, Rouen was surrounded by the forces of the King of France. Normandy had been lost. Peter, in agreement with the leading men of the city, surrendered to Philip of France. Peter then took ship to England where he was well received by King John as he brought the Channel Islands, of which he was the Governor, under the control of the English Crown. Family Peter was granted some of the lands of his brother John as Terra Normanorum. In addition, Peter married in 1201 Mary de Vernon, daughter of William de Vernon, 5th Earl of Devon and the Isle of Wight. Peter retired to a quiet life on his new English estates. It is believed that he died sometime in the year 1212.

Career  = Observatory = In 1793 Von Hahn started the construction of a private observatory, the first in Mecklenburg, which was well equipped. He owned some of the largest mirrors made by William Herschel and precision instruments for determining the position of stars. He used his instruments in order to observe various stars, including the sun, planets, and nebulae. = Discoveries and observations = Von Hahn spent a significant amount of time observing the nebula NGC 3242, originally discovered by William Herschel. He documented the change in position and shape of the nebula over the course of a year. He also observed the Mira star system, which he had erroneously thought to be a nebula. The discovery Von Hahn in best known for is his 1800 discovery of the central star in the Ring Nebula M 57, in the constellation, Lyra. This discovery contributed to Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix's discovery of the nebula 21 years earlier.  Death and memory  He died in Remplin, Mecklenburg, Germany on October 9, 1805 at the age of 63. After his death, his son, the \\"theatrical count\\" and father of author Ida, Countess von Hahn-Hahn, squandered his fortune and all books and instruments were sold. The best instruments were bought by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel for the new observatory in K√∂nigsberg. One instrument is on display in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. His herschelian telescope was acquired in 1812 by the Neapolitan astronomer, Federigo Zuccari, for the new Capodimonte Observatory . Now the mirror of this telescope is part of the Observatory Museum collection. He is honoured together with Otto Hahn by the lunar crater Hahn.

It has been syndicated since 1990, currently by Andrews McMeel Syndication. The comic centers on a suburban family of five; two parents, two boys, Toby, a moody adolescent and Eddie, a young boy, and their paternal grandfather. The Stantis family pet, Dogzilla, was the only character to keep his own name when Scott first created the strip based on his own family. The real world Dogzilla died in 2006 at the age of 17. Greg Cravens had sole responsibility of the strip at Dogzilla's death, and says Dogzilla will live on in the comic strip. His own dog is named Gi'Tli, which is Cherokee for 'Dog'. Stantis left The Buckets completely to focus on politically oriented Prickly City and The Buckets is currently being handled by Greg Cravens. Cravens was hired just after the tenth anniversary of the strip. He went from being the art assistant to credited art assistant to partner and eventually sole writer and artist of the strip. The two sons in the strip, Toby and Eddie, began as younger characters. Eddie was a toddler and Toby was a first grader or kindergartener. As the strip progressed, the children aged, but not at the same rate. For writing and humor purposes, Toby landed at age 15, and Eddie at age 6. Main characters Francis Denver \\"Bronco\\" Bucket - Larry's father, and grandfather to Toby and Eddie. He's your typical crotchety old man - rough to his adult kids, and friends, but usually soft and gentle to his grandsons. He lives in the house with his son, daughter-in-law, and grandsons. Larry Bucket - The father of the house. He is a typical dim-witted, loving, hardworking husband. Larry was born between 1945 and 1968. Sarah Bucket (n√©e Smyrna) - The mother of the house. She used to be a high school nurse. She and Larry had Toby when Sarah was roughly 30 years old. Toby Bucket - The oldest child. He was in 1st grade when the comic began. Sometime in the early 2000s he was aged up, and has stayed at around 15 years old, and in grade nine for over 2 decades. Eddie Bucket - The rambunctious 6 year old and youngest child. He's got wit and adorableness going for him. When the strip started, he was still in diapers, but was brought up to age 6 for comedic purposes. Recurring Characters Toby has several named and unnamed friends who've shown up, as has Eddie. References * Strickler, Dave. Syndicated Comic Strips and Artists, 1924-1995: The Complete Index.

The reluctant hero is typically portrayed either as an everyman forced into surreal situations which require them to rise to heroism, or as a person with special abilities who nonetheless evinces a desire to avoid using those abilities for the benefit of others. In either case, the reluctant hero does not initially seek adventure or the opportunity to do good, and their apparent selfishness may draw them into the category of antiheroes. The reluctant hero differs from the antihero in that the story arc of the former inevitably results in their becoming a true hero. In many stories, the reluctant hero is portrayed as having a period of doubt after their initial venture into heroism. This may be brought about by the negative consequences of their own heroic actions, or by the achievement of some position of personal safety ‚Äì leaving the audience to wonder whether the reluctant hero will return to heroism at the moment when they're needed the most. Quotes A summary of the archetype: Another commentator notes, with respect to game design: Examples =In fiction= *In the movie Die Hard, Officer John McClane of the NYPD became a reluctant hero, when on Christmas Eve, East German terrorist Hans Gruber took over the Nakatomi Plaza, Los Angeles in an attempt to steal millions of bearer bonds. McClane, who was at Nakatomi Plaza, where his wife, Holly Gennaro was an employee, for the Christmas Party, was able to remain hidden from the group of terrorists, and was able to cause chaos, eventually spoiling Gruber's Christmas celebrations. Sgt. Al Powell of the LAPD who did not like using a gun after accidentally killing a young boy at a crime scene, also becomes a reluctant hero when he shoots and kills, the enraged terrorist known only as 'Karl'. *Robert A. Segal characterizes Arjuna from the Hindu epic The Mahabharata as a reluctant hero. Arjuna casts aside his weapons, fearful at the prospect of killing his kinsman during a civil war. Krishna then relates to Arjuna a series of arguments that convince Arjuna to go to war nonetheless. *In Star Wars, Han Solo is portrayed as a reluctant hero. He is hesitant to join the Alliance to Restore the Republic due to being an outlaw. In the Expanded Universe novel Balance Point his son Jacen fit the characteristics of reluctant hero. He is unwilling to fight out of fear that the galaxy will tumble into darkness. In the end, he saves his mother's life and wounds the Yuuzhan Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah. *Spider-Man also fits the criteria of reluctant hero as throughout his career, Peter Parker constantly questions his decision to become a superhero. One of the most famous examples would be The Amazing Spider-Man issue 50, titled Spider-Man No More!. *Eddie Valiant from Who Framed Roger Rabbit fits into this category, being forced out of a depressive funk in order to solve a murder and prove the innocence of Roger Rabbit. *Captain Mainwaring, of Dad's Army, shows traits of a reluctant hero as he casts aside his self-important personality to protect his platoon and country. *The Reluctant Dragon *Max Rockatansky =In real life= *Alvin York, a World War I draftee who was a conscientious objector, but who as a soldier defeated a large contingent German troops as a sniper.

It has been acclaimed as a masterpiece of modern gothic literature; Urban was praised as \\"the dark knight of Czech literature\\" and the book has been translated into 11 languages (English, German, French, Dutch, Hungarian, Russian, Spanish, Slovene, Croatian, Polish, and Bulgarian). The Seven Churches was the first of a loose trilogy known as the \\"church trilogy\\". Hastrman came out in 2001. The novel received the Magnesia Litera Award for prose writing, and has been translated into Hungarian. A film based on the novel was produced in 2018. It is a controversial, uncompromising story combining motifs from Czech myths and folktales with the issue of ecology. Urban follows the story of a water-goblin through several centuries to create a parable for the environmental damage caused by humans. This book was followed the following year by Memoirs of an MP, the so-called \\"sexy novel\\" and a considerable departure from Urban's previous books, which was described as \\"the most searing, most bizarre and most anarchistic condemnation of democratic totalitarianism\\". Urban next returned to the final two books of the \\"church trilogy\\": Shadow of the Cathedral (2003), which sold out within two weeks of its release, and Santini's Language (2005), which drew comparisons to Dan Brown. In 2007 Urban released Fields and Palisades: The Myth of the Princess and the Farmer, a version of the story of P≈ôemysl the Ploughman and Libu≈°e, the legendary origin story of the Czech people, as part of the Canongate Myth Series. This was followed by 2008's Dead Girls, an anthology of gothic mysteries written between 2002 and 2006. A review in Czech daily Pr√°vo said that \\"Urban writes wonderful gothic mystery stories ‚Äì and even Jakub Arbes might envy him this collection\\". Lord Mord, released the same year, is set amid the slum clearance of Prague in the late 19th century, in which the murder of prostitutes is employed as an allegory for the harm caused to the city. In 2011 Urban released Boletus arcanus, a satire about drug dependency and human need that references the Czech pastime of mushroom picking. Praga Picolla, released the following year, is a more traditional historical novel set in the time of the First Czechoslovak Republic. This was followed in 2014 by She Came From The Sea, a detective mystery about a girl who emerges from the sea on the British coast one day without explanation. In 2015, Urban released Urbo Kune, a sci-fi tinged novel written as a response to a request from Vienna architect, Jan Tabor, for European artists and writers to join a project dedicated to a united Europe. Personal life Urban now lives in the Bohnice district of Prague, and works as a writer, translator, and editor in a publishing house.

Education In 1877‚Äì78, Krauss attended the University of Vienna. Career One of his first publications was a translation of Artemidoros' of Daldis Interpretation of Dreams was cited in Sigmund Freud's book The Interpretation of Dreams. He began his career as a folklorist and ethnologist. In 1884‚Äì85, Krauss received funding from the Crown Prince Rudolf to gather folklore and ballads of the Guslar singers in Bosnia, Croatia and Herzegovina. As a result of this field research, he published a two-volume collection of fairytales, Sagen und M√§rchen der S√ºdslaven. Perhaps his most famous work was the Anthropophytia (1904-1913), a scholarly yearbook which published folklore of erotic and sexual content. In alliance with the growing psychoanalytic movement, Krauss and his colleagues felt that sexual folklore, which was generally purged from all published collections by scholars, could provide valuable information about a culture and society. He was a correspondent of Freud and used the term paraphilia to describe certain deviant sexual practices. His research in the field of sexuality led to some conflict. In 1913 Anthropophytia was banned and Krauss was brought to trial in Berlin as a pornographer. He was convicted, which caused him a large financial loss and hurt his reputation. Krauss lived and worked as a writer, private scholar, and translator in Vienna. His translations include Rites of All Nations by John Gregory Bourke.

The film, starring Julie Christie, Alan Bates, Terence Stamp and Peter Finch, and directed by John Schlesinger, was Schlesinger's fourth film (and his third collaboration with Christie). It marked a stylistic shift away from his earlier works exploring contemporary urban mores. The cinematography was by Nicolas Roeg and the soundtrack was by Richard Rodney Bennett. He also used traditional folk songs in various scenes throughout the film. It was nominated for one Oscar for Best Original Music Score and two BAFTAs, Best British Cinematography (Colour) and Best British Costume (Colour) (Alan Barrett). Plot Set in the rural West Country in Victorian England, the story features Bathsheba Everdene (Julie Christie), a beautiful, headstrong, independently minded woman who inherits her uncle's farm and decides to manage it herself. This engenders some disapproval from the local farming community. She employs a former neighbour, Gabriel Oak (Alan Bates), as a shepherd; rejected by her earlier as a suitor, Gabriel lost his own flock after one of his dogs drove them off a cliff. Bathsheba impulsively sends a valentine to William Boldwood (Peter Finch), a nearby gentleman farmer. Misinterpreting her capriciousness, he falls passionately in love with her and proposes; Bathsheba promises to consider his offer. However, she soon meets and becomes enamoured of Frank Troy (Terence Stamp), a dashing cavalry sergeant. Troy was to marry young Fanny Robin (Prunella Ransome), a maidservant pregnant with his child, but she went to the wrong church on their wedding day; Troy, unreasonably insulted and humiliated, refuses to go through with the ceremony. He was then posted to a different town. Bathsheba marries Troy but soon regrets her impulsive decision. Troy gambles away much of Bathsheba's money and creates disharmony among the farmhands. He is filled with remorse upon learning that Fanny has died in childbirth and swears he never loved Bathsheba. He leaves her and his clothes are later found by the ocean where he has presumably drowned. Boldwood coerces Bathsheba to marry him once Troy is declared legally dead. However, the sergeant reappears at their engagement party to reclaim his wife; Boldwood shoots and kills him. Boldwood is last seen in a prison cell, awaiting execution. Gabriel tells Bathsheba that he is emigrating to America. Realising how much she needs his quiet strength and unselfish devotion, Bathsheba persuades Gabriel to remain in Weatherbury, and they marry.

The budget was $3 million, 80% of which was provided by MGM, 20% by Anglo-Amalgamated. The film was shot largely on location in Dorset and Wiltshire.IMDB.com, retrieved 25 January 2018 Release The film premiered on 16 October 1967 at the Odeon Marble Arch attended by Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon. Reception The film is memorable for the subtly erotic scene between Sgt. Troy and Bathsheba in which he flaunts his expert skills as a swordsman in a private fencing display in a prehistoric earthwork (actually Maiden Castle). An enthralled Bathsheba stands immobile before him. Roger Ebert found the scenes of the rural area and rural life to be \\"splendid\\". His strongest criticism is that the film missed the point of the small society of rural life: > Thomas Hardy's novel told of a 19th century rural England in which class > distinctions and unyielding social codes surrounded his characters. They > were far from the madding crowd whether they liked it or not, and got > tangled in each other's problems because there was nowhere else to turn. > It's not simply that Bathsheba (Julie Christie) was courted by the three men > in her life, but that she was courted by ALL three men in her life. The film performed well at the box office in the UK but was a commercial failure in the US. Far from the Madding Crowd received mixed to positive reviews from critics, as the film holds a 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews.

It was released in Japan on April 28, 1994, in North America later the same year, and in Europe on February 23, 1995. It is the only Super Bomberman game without a 2-player story mode, although one was originally planned.  Gameplay  =Story Mode= The story mode consists of walking through maze-like areas filled with blocks, monsters, and switches with a goal of opening the gate leading to the next area. To accomplish this, the player lays bombs to destroy all the monsters and flip all the switches. Destroying blocks in the maze will uncover useful power-ups to increase their bomb count, firepower, speed, and grant them special abilities such as remote control bombs, throwing bombs, and taking an extra hit. There are 5 worlds total, and at the end of each world is a boss. Each boss is first battled on foot before retreating into a giant machine. After the boss is defeated, the player will move on to the next world. =Multiplayer= In Battle Mode, 2 players (4 with a multitap) can face off against one another in one of 12 arenas designed specifically for multiplayer. Matches can be customized as battle royal matches or team matches. A special option called G-Bomber was added making the winner of each match golden and giving them an item to begin the next match with. Story 5 evil cyborgs called the Five Dastardly Bombers are bent on taking over the universe. On Earth, they capture the original Bomberman, and he is placed in a prison cell in their space station. He awakens in the dungeon of Magnet Bomber and must fight his way to a final showdown with the Magnet Bomber himself. In the following four worlds, Bomberman will challenge Golem Bomber, Pretty Bomber, Brain Bomber, and their leader, Plasma Bomber, in an effort to free the Earth and himself from these alien invaders.  Reception  Scary Larry of GamePro gave the game a positive review, praising the strategic gameplay, cute graphics, and music, though he remarked that the single player mode is considerably less engaging than the multiplayer. Next Generation reviewed the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is truly God's perfect party game.\\" Next Generations 1996 lexicon of video game terms included the joke entries \\"Bomb-o'clock\\" and \\"Bombaholic\\", in which they referred to Super Bomberman 2 as \\"the videogame of choice for game developers everywhere\\".

To the west, RAF Menwith Hill is visible. To the north, both the Kilburn White Horse, and Bilsdale Television mast some away may be seen during darkness. The Name Shirbutt Lane is Derived from Shire Butts, from Days When the village was a Jousting Location, it is still possible on occasion to recognise the location of the jousting butts. Hessay is described in the Domesday Book at Hesdesai, the lake where the hazels grew. Hessay used to have a railway station on the Harrogate Line. The station closed to passengers in 1958, but the Ministry of Defence sidings at Hessay were open until 1991 with closure of the unit effected by March 1996. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 181, increasing to 265 at the 2011 Census. Before 1996 it had been part of the Harrogate district. Recent developments have increased the population to over 300 though the actual figure is not known. There are approximately ninety houses in Hessay. Churches Although the village has no pub, no post office and no shop, it has two fine churches - St John the Baptist Anglican church and the Methodist church. The village was given to the St Mary's Abbey, York by Osbern de Archis and continued in their possession until The Dissolution.

According to Isidore of Seville, Remismund was a son of Maldras.Thompson, 218. Remismund's early career was spent as an ambassador between Galicia and Gaul, which trip he made several times.Thompson, 167. After an interregnum of approximately four years (460-464), during which the Sueves who had previously recognised Maldras as king were led by Frumar and those who had recognised Framta followed Rechimund while both their leaders fought for the throne, Remismund, returning from one of his embassies, succeeded in having himself recognised as king of a unified Suevic people. This occurred after Frumar's death, but scholars are not certain of the significance of that statement. Had Frumar become sole king? Or did Remismund initially succeed Frumar only over part of the Suevic nation? Furthermore, Remismund is sometimes identified with Rechimund. Remismund was confirmed in the kingship when the Visigothic monarch, Theodoric II, sent him gifts, including weapons, and a Gothic princess for a wife.Thompson, 168. The involvement of Theodoric in the succession of Remismund has, however, been exaggerated by Jordanes, who claims that after the Gothic king put down the revolt and usurpation of Aioulf, he allowed the Suevi to elect a king of their own, and they chose Remismund. In 466, on the authority of Hydatius, Theodoric sent an envoy, Salla, to the court of Remismund.Thompson, 190. Remismund may have sent one Palagorius, a noble Galician, as an envoy to Theodoric, but it is possible that Palagorius went on a private mission.Thompson, 209. In 465 he sacked Coimbra or Con√≠mbriga and in 468 destroyed it, plundering the goods of a noble family called the Cantabri.Thompson, 201. In 469 the city of Lisbon was betrayed to the Suevi by a native Roman named Lusidius. Also in 469 Remismund began negotiations with the Roman Emperor Anthemius through a large embassy of Sueves led by Lusidius. In 466 he requested an Arian missionary from the Gothic court and received Ajax, a Gaul or Galatian, who converted the Suevic nobility and established an Arian church in Galicia.Arias, 21.

Due to Rufforth's close proximity to York the production of fresh goods for transport into the city became a viable and profitable option for local farmers. The dairy industry was a major contributor to the local economy until the decline in profitability led to many small dairy farms to cease production. There is now only one dairy farm left within the Rufforth parish. Rufforth's surrounding farmland is now mainly used for a mixture of livestock, cereal and root vegetable enterprises. When travelling around the Rufforth area you will notice large numbers of beef cattle, sheep in lower numbers and a thriving equine industry. Sown cereals are mainly autumn and spring sown barley, wheat, maize and oilseed rape. Other large contributors to local agriculture are potatoes and sugarbeet (although sugarbeet quantities have sharply declined after the closure of the British Sugar Factory in York). Notable landmarks and residents The Lord of the Manor of Rufforth, Henry Justice was exiled for stealing books in the 1700s.

Following Gregory's account (the Historia Francorum, written between 573 and 579), leprosy was a common disease in Galicia during the mid-sixth century and the king's son was a victim. The Suevi at that time were Arians, but Chararic, having heard of Martin of Tours, promised to accept the beliefs of the saint if only his son would be cured, and so he sent for some relics from Tours. When the relics were brought to Galicia and his son was healed by the intercession of Saint Martin, Chararic and the entire royal household converted to the Nicene faith.Thompson, 83. Gregory also notes that on the same day that Martin's relics entered the Galician harbour, another ship was landing bearing Martin of Dumio, future archbishop of Braga and saint. Gregory is unreliable on this point, however, because he adds further in his De Virtutibus S. Martini that the relics and the future bishop had both left on their journeys to Galicia on the same day as well, but as the relics travelled velociter and Martin travelled from Pannonia, their trips could not have been of identical length.Thompson, 83 n2. Gregory's account has come under criticism in modern times, largely because it is at odds with the other accounts of the Catholicisation of the Suevi, namely Isidore of Seville, John of Biclaro, and the minutes of the First Council of Braga. If, as Gregory relates, Martin died about the year 580 and had been bishop for about thirty years, then the conversion of Chararic must have occurred around 550 at the latest. Attempts to fix the chronology and the identities of the three kings associated with the Catholicisation--Chararic, Theodemir, and Ariamir--have been numerous.Thompson, 86. Reinhart suggested that Chararic was converted first through the cure of his son and that Theodemir was converted later through the preaching of Martin of Dumio. It has also been alleged that if Chararic existed he must have been a successor of Ariamir's, since Ariamir was the first Suevic monarch to lift the ban on Catholic synods.Thompson, 87. Ferreiro believes the conversion of the Suevi was progressive and stepwise and that Chararic's public conversion was only followed by the lifting of a ban on Catholic synods in the reign of his successor, which would have been Ariamir.Ferreiro, passim. Chararic has also been equated with Theodemir, some even saying that the latter was the name he took upon baptism (Dahn).Thompson, 86 n2. It has also been suggested that Theodemir and Ariamir were the same person and the son of Chararic. In the opinion of some historians, Chararic is nothing more than an error on the part of Gregory of Tours and never existed.Thompson, 88. Chararic introduced the cult of Martin of Tours to Galicia and made him the beatus patronus of the province. He died no later than 1 May 559 and no earlier than 2 May 558, the dates between which Ariamir succeeded to the throne.

Caylus has a mix of building, producing, planning, and bargaining ‚Äî without direct conflict or dice-rolling mechanics. A card-game version, Caylus Magna Carta, was published in 2007, as well as a limited premium version of the game, with redesigned medieval-styled artwork and metallic coins. An iOS version of the game was launched in 2012. Game mechanics The goal of Caylus is to amass the most prestige points by constructing buildings and by working on the castle of Caylus in medieval France. Caylus does not include the random elements found in many board games, such as cards and dice. The only exceptions to this are the placement of the six neutral buildings (leading to 720 possible starting configurations) and the initial turn order, both of which are determined randomly at the beginning of the game. However, the effect of random initial turn order is minimal because players whose turn is later start off with a higher amount of money. The basic mechanics of the game include: =Resources= * Resource cubes of five types: food (pink), wood (brown), cloth (purple), stone (gray), and gold (yellow). These are used to build buildings and the castle. * Workers: Each player has six workers, which can be placed on buildings to harvest resources, construct more buildings, build the castle, and more. * Bailiff: The bailiff moves either one or two spaces from his starting spot on every turn in the game. The pace of his movement can be influenced by the players through the Provost (see below). When the bailiff reaches a pre-determined space, he triggers the conclusion of a phase of construction of Caylus castle (see below). When the bailiff reaches the third such space, the game is over. * Provost: The provost indicates by his position which of the workers placed by the players will be allowed to work on any given turn: workers ahead of him are not allowed to work. The provost's position can be influenced by the players with money (see below) or with special spaces on the board. Furthermore, if at the end of a turn the provost ends up on or behind the bailiff, then the bailiff will only move one space forward that round. If the provost is in front of the bailiff, then the bailiff moves ahead two spaces, thus shortening the game. * Money: Caylus currency is called the denier. Deniers are used to pay workers, influence the provost to allow workers to work or to block opponents' workers from working, use the jousting field to gain royal favors (see below), and build certain buildings. * Neutral buildings: Six neutral buildings are randomly placed at the start of the game; along with initial turn order, this is the only source of randomness in the game. * Player buildings: By placing a worker on a construction building, a player can construct a new building; each new building has a fixed cost of 2 to 8 resource cubes (some costs being a white wildcard, allowing payment of any resource type). Once built, all players can use the new building, but the original builder gets a bonus every time an opponent uses it. * Building the castle: By placing a worker in the castle, a player can send a \\"batch\\" of three different resource cubes (one of which must be food) to help construct the castle of Caylus and reap prestige points and royal favors. * Royal favors: Players who contribute to the royal cause by building the castle, using the jousting field, or constructing certain buildings are granted royal favors. In the story of the game, prestige and royal favors are granted by King Philip the Fair. Royal favors can take the form of prestige points, money, resources, or discounted, unblockable access to construct buildings. These royal favors can often be the deciding factor in the game, when used cleverly. =Turns= A turn in Caylus consists of 8 phases: #Income. Each player receives a standard income of 2 deniers, plus any income for Residential buildings s/he owns (or prestige buildings that provide income). #Placement of workers. According to the turn order, players take turns placing their workers on unoccupied spaces (with some exceptions). Each worker placement costs 1 denier. The players may pass once they have placed all the workers they want (or can afford). Every time a player passes, the cost of placing additional workers on that turn increases by 1 for the other players. #Activation of special buildings. The special buildings (the first 5 buildings after the castle, but before the bridge) are activated, and their effects are applied. #The provost moves. Each player (in order of passing) has the opportunity to move the provost backward or forward by paying 1 denier per space, up to a maximum of 3. After this phase, any workers that are located after the provost are removed, as they are not allowed to work. #Activation of buildings. Starting with the first neutral (pink) building after the bridge, all remaining buildings activate in order. #Building of the castle. Players build the section of the castle (dungeon, walls, or tower) that is currently under construction. This is done in the order in which players placed their workers to build the castle. #The end of the turn. The bailiff moves along the road. He moves forward 2 spaces if the provost is ahead of him, and 1 space if the provost is on the same space as he or behind him. He never moves backwards. Once the bailiff has been moved, the provost is placed on the same square as the bailiff. #Scoring of sections. If the bailiff reaches a scoring point, or a section of the castle is completed, then that section is scored. The player who is at the top of the turn order starts the next turn. The game ends when the bailiff reaches the Tower scoring point, or when all the tower spaces have been built (automatically triggering the scoring of the Tower section). After the final prestige points are awarded for any leftover money and resources, the player with the most prestige points wins the game. Awards Caylus initially gained public acclaim when it was rated the number one game of the October 2005 game fair in Essen, Germany by a public vote conducted by Fairplay Magazine. It quickly rose to become one of the most discussed and top-rated games on BoardGameGeek, a popular online board gaming forum. Caylus also received the Trictrac d'or 2005 award from the eponymous French boardgame website. With the international attention gained via BoardGameGeek and Essen 2005, the first printing of Caylus sold out in December 2005. A second printing was released in February 2006, including new cardboard coins to replace the gray plastic tiddlywinks-style coins from the original release. The second edition also includes the jeweler as a standard stone building tile (it was previously a promotional tile) and numerous graphic design changes to clarify certain rules. Although Caylus was not nominated for the 2006 Spiel des Jahres, the jury awarded it a special prize (Sonderpreis Komplexes Spiel) for the best complex game of 2006.http://www.spiel-des- jahres.com/cms/front_content.php?idcatart=196‚ü®=1&client;=1 Caylus won first prize in the 2006 Deutscher Spiele Preis and Nederlandse Spellenprijs, and won the 2006 Golden Geek Awards for Best Game and Best Gamer's Game.

Artesia is also the name of the heroine of the cycle. Smylie has described her as a \\"Pagan Joan of Arc\\", to use a popular reference, while noting that the closest historical model is the Irish Queen Medb. Themes in the series include feudal politics, intrigue, and power struggles, complex mythology and world history, and strong female characters. Currently the series is composed of four \\"books\\": Artesia, Artesia Afield, Artesia Afire and Artesia Besieged. Each book is composed of six episodes, or fairly American standard comic book-sized episodes. Each book has been followed by an annual compendium including short stories and details of the history, geography and mythology of Artesia's universe. The books together constitute part of a cycle called The Book of Dooms. Smylie has said that it would take 22 books to tell Artesia's story in full, but that at least 7 will be completed \\"hell or high water\\". Artesia's first two books were published by Sirius Entertainment. After that point it was published by Archaia Studios Press, which was founded by Smylie. In 2005, a role-playing game set in the world of Artesia was released. It uses the Fuzion role-playing system, and is called Artesia: Adventures in the Known World. Artesia Artesia is tall and beautiful. She is highly intelligent and sexually open. It is strongly hinted throughout the series that Artesia (and most, if not all, of the other female characters) is bisexual. She has a keen understanding of war and strategy. She possesses an enchanted sword of an unknown magic type from outside the Highlands and it will inflict wounds on otherworldly creatures that cannot otherwise be hurt by mere steel. It contains five magical runes; the smith Hymachus believes it to be 800 to 1,000 years old and possibly made by the legendary armorer Brage. Artesia was born in the Middle Kingdoms to Byron and Argante, the witch of An-Athair. Her mother began teaching her the tenets of witchcraft at an early age. Artesia was raised in the predominant religion of the Middle Kingdoms, the worship of Islik and his father, Helios, the Sun King. She also had two younger brothers, Stjepan and Justin. As a young girl playing in the forest, Artesia found the body of a female warrior who had been killed by bandits, but who had slain all of her attackers. She took the dead warrior's sword, which was an enchanted blade, and practiced with it secretly, desiring to be a warrior like its previous owner. Ultimately, her mother was discovered and burned as a witch by the Witch-Hunters of the Knights of Saint Agall, a military order. Her father was unable or unwilling to intervene and she fled to the Highlands of Daradja, near the ancient citadel of Dara Dess. There, she became the concubine of King Branimir (Bran the Wolf) and learned to use sex as a tool. She also converted to the Highland religion, worshiping the Goddess Yhera, becoming a priestess. Acting on her desire to be a warrior, she seduced Ulin, King Bran's commander, into training her as a soldier and a commander. She thus succeeded in becoming one of Bran's most capable war- captains. King Bran had six other concubines that Artesia refers to as her sisters. As time passed, King Bran became alarmed at Artesia's growing confidence and popularity, especially as the Highland tribes were a somewhat matriarchal society and Dara Dess had long been ruled by a line of female warrior-queens. Bran decided that Artesia had to be killed to safeguard his throne. He sent her company out to fight a neighboring king, King Alexus, in the hopes that his champion would kill her. Simultaneously, he invited the Knights of St Agall to assist him in disposing of her as a back-up plan, which was needed when she survived the battle against Alexus‚Äô champion. This was Bran's fatal mistake. By inviting the Knights of St Agall into the Highlands, he agreed to convert to their worship of Helios and Islik, an act that cost him the support of many of his followers, devout adherents of Yhera. Additionally, Artesia was aware of the plot through her witchcraft and was able to kill the two assassins sent to dispatch her. While some of her company remained loyal to Bran, she raised the standard of revolt and was joined by the Highland tribesmen, allowing her to defeat the combined forces of King Bran and the Knights, pushing them back into the Citadel of Dara Dess and besieging them. When one of her brothers, Stjepan, arrived with word that the Thessid Empire had invaded the Middle Kingdoms, Artesia attempted to negotiate with Bran, but was rebuffed, causing most of his remaining forces to desert. It was also discovered via Artesia's magic that Bran's men had murdered his concubines. She was able to gather the spirits of several of them and bind them to hers to prevent them from being devoured by otherworldly creatures. Supported by the other Highland Kings, her army then stormed the citadel, killing Ulin before Bran was betrayed by his guards, allowing Artesia to mystically bind his spirit to this world before beheading him. His head remains on a spear in the throne room of Dara Dess, there he will see everything and one day, report on what he has observed before his spirit will be released. Artesia's position as both a witch and a priestess of Yhera gives her magical abilities that allow her to see visions and cross dimensional planes, see through the eyes of a crow and bind the souls of her sister- concubines to her. She can enter rooms magically and eavesdrop on the conversations held therein. She is attended in battle by three she-demons (Mormo, Dimidce and Charize) who assist her at critical moments and she can summon spirit-guides to escort the dead to the after-life. She can also prevent the dead from entering the after-life if she so chooses. Her magic is shown to be strong enough to break the magic of the Thessid sorcerers in several instances. In the immediate aftermath of her victory over Bran, Artesia does not claim the title of Queen of Dara Dess in spite of her captains insisting that she do so. Ultimately, she agrees to accept the crown as it increases her status in the Middle Kingdoms and helps her in her dealings with her allies to counter the Thessid invasion. She leads the Highland army, bolstered with contingents from the other Highland Kings, into the Middle Kingdoms to fight the Thessids. Artesia's lieutenants *Ferris, a short haired female warrior. She is also a Cult Sister of the Cult of Hathhalla, a subset of the worship of Yhera. A dour individual as befits a follower of Hathalla. *Umaza - Another one of Artesia's female warriors, Umaza wears her hair in braids. She and Demetrius were noted by King Alexus as being excellent soldiers. She is on a familiar basis with Artesia and unafraid to chide her for being promiscuous. *Demetrius - A male warrior, Demetrius was recognized by King Alexus (along with Umaza) as a good soldier to employ. He and Vaslov once killed a Wyrm and its scales are used in their armor. *Pavel, Artesia's cavalry commander. She frequently trusts him with independent missions. When he arrived to join her rebellion, she caressed his cheek, as he is one of her lovers. When Beric, Lord Hus, brags to others about sleeping with Artesia, Pavel is offended and intends to discuss the matter with him. *Yerwin - The Chief of Scouts, Yerwin wears no steel armor, only a brown leather jerkin and has a grey goatee. Artesia refers to him as Hawkeye. *Hymachus - A blacksmith and armorer, his skill is highly regarded by everyone. He adapts Bran's Wyrm Scale armor into a suit of armor for Artesia, infusing it with his own arsenal magic. *Bela and Borna - Twin brothers who are also master trackers. They each captured one of the towers of the Citadel of Dara Dess when it was stormed. *Moromir - A steady old soldier, Moromir has a sense of gallows humor. Artesia teases him about his drinking but it is unclear whether he is a drinker or a teetotaler. He is completely bald. *Uros - A member of King Bran's guard, he, along with all the others, switched sides and became Artesia's bodyguard. He is bound by oath and magic to protect her but is not trusted by Sava. Sava accuses him of being a rapist and murderer for participating in the murders of King Bran's concubines, a charge he does not deny. Sava has promised to kill him should he outlive Artesia. He is considered the most dangerous swordsman in the Daradjan Highlands. *Sav, who acts as Artesia's chamberlain in spite of the fact that she is an excellent swordsman. She commanded the camp and lost her left arm at the battle of Collwyn. She hates Uros and has sworn to kill him for his complicity in the murder of King Bran's concubines. She is also training the girl Erce to be a page for Artesia. *Daemander. He is the captain of a unit of Palatian mercenaries hired by Artesia. He is assisted by three other officers, Samaia, Irgrath (both females), and Tyrius. The Palatian mercenaries are very skilled fighters but their true motives are unknown. *Dahlia ‚Äì Dahlia is described as a camp follower and a courtesan. In actuality, she is Artesia's spy in the camp of the Palatian mercenaries. Unbeknown to them, she speaks the Palatian language and beds their officers to ascertain their true motive. Thus far, she has been unsuccessful. *Hueyln. Wounded in the battle with King Alexus, Artesia trusts him enough to leave him in Dara Dess as her regent while she is on campaign. *Dymas and Constans, two of Artesia's lieutenants who refused to join her revolt against Bran. She was disappointed at Dymas‚Äô refusal. Dymas was mortally wounded in battle and was found afterward by Artesia, who spared his spirit from being taken by demons on the Night of the Wild Hunt. Constans abandoned King Bran at Dara Dess and fled. Others *The Highland Kings ‚Äì There are four great citadels in the Daradjan Highlands, each held by a King. Artesia is the Queen of Dara Dess, the largest of the four. The other three are: **Gavagh of Heth Moll ‚Äì The oldest of the Citadel Kings, Gavagh wears a mask over his face.

His Wizard Mutoric, enchanted the blade used by the Agallite widow when she tried to assassinate Artesia. Becir is his bannerman who rides with the Highland army under Artesia's command. *Becir, Lord Hus, commands the troops from An-Athark who ride with the Highland army. He and the two other commanders engaged in a sexual encounter with Artesia, after which, Becir was overheard by Pavel bragging about it in crude terms. Becir's second in command, Mirsed, has implied that he would kill Becir if given the chance. *King Caslav ‚Äì King of Umat, also known as the Silver King, Caslav commands the wing of the Middle Kingdom army that Artesia's Highlanders are attached to. They become lovers, but he is a jealous man and rejects her when he realizes she is not solely his. *Owen Lis Red ‚Äì Grand Duke of Har Misal and Marshal of the northernmost Middle Kingdom army.

It consists of those parts of Clifton that lie outside, i.e. Without, the (pre-1996) city boundaries and Clifton Moor. It lies on the A19 about two miles north-west of central York. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 5,113, increasing to 5,246 at the 2011 Census. Before 1996 it formed part of the Ryedale district. The Parish is bounded by the River Ouse to the west and the B1363 road and River Foss in the east, and from the Clifton Moor retail park in the north to near Clifton Green in the south. The parish contains a diverse mix of industrial and retail areas, to residential areas in the rest of the parish. The area also includes the natural areas of Clifton Ings and Clifton Backies and Rawcliffe Lake. History On 27 May 1933 an air circus visited York and flew from Rawcliffe meadow, now the site of Clifton Moor Retail Park. It demonstrated the viability of the area for a commercial airfield for York. In 1934 York Corporation compulsory purchased parts of Clifton (Without) and Rawcilffe and on, 4 July 1936 York Municipal Aerodrome opened. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the airfield was managed by Yorkshire Air Services and Country Club Ltd, who ran a flying club and an air taxi service, but no scheduled flights. On 1 September 1939 the airfield was requisitioned by the government for military use and was renamed RAF Clifton. It was host to a flight of Whitley Bombers. Following an upgrade in status, the airfield became host to reconnaissance aircraft such as the Westland Lysander and the North American Mustang. The airfield also contained a large civilian staffed repair facility for the Halifax bomber. The repair centre was closed in 1948, after which the airfield returned to its former role as a flying club. Due to the high rents charged by the Air Ministry, which had not de-commissioned the site, the club closed in the 1950s and fell into disuse. Parts of the airfield can still be seen around the area, including a small portion of the runway to the north of the York Outer Ring Road. The airfield is now covered by the Clifton Moor Retail Park. Governance Clifton Without is part of the Rawcliffe and Clifton Without Ward in the City of York. As of 2019 the Ward is represented by Councillors Darryl Smalley, Derek Wann and Sam Waudby, all from the local Liberal Democrats. It is also has its own parish council consisting of 10 councillors. Geography The parish is bounded to the west by the River Ouse and the B1363 and River Foss to the east. To the north the parish meets the parish of Rawcliffe. To the south the boundary runs past Homestead Park from the Ouse then northward along the A19 to turn east along Brompton Road, then it turns north up Water Lane before going east again along Lilbourne Drive and then following the waterway known as Bur Dyke. Where Bur Dyke reaches Bootham Stray it extends an arm towards the Nestle Factory they and ends at the River Foss. The parish contains Clifton Backies Nature Reserve which, in 2002, was designated as a local nature reserve. The diverse habitats support many different species of mammal, bird, insect and plant life. It was part of the former Clifton Airfield but after its last use in the Berlin Airlift in the late 1940s, it was allowed to return to nature. The land originally belonged to St Mary's Abbey, but after the dissolution of the monasteries the land was part of a furlong or field known as 'Moor Broats' and cultivated under the strip farming system in medieval times. The current ridge and furrow appearance of the fields shows its previous history.

From the Codex Vigilanus, Escorial Library. Theodemir or Theodemar (, ; died 570) was one of the last Suevic kings of Galicia and one of the first Chalcedonian Christians to hold the title. He succeeded Ariamir sometime between the end of May 561 and the year 566 and ruled until his death. Theodemir has been posited as the first Orthodox Christian monarch of the Suevi since the death of Rechiar and the monarch who brought about the conversion of his people from Arianism to orthodoxy with the help of the missionary Martin of Dumio. This theory is largely based on the Historia Suevorum of Isidore of Seville: regni potestatem Theodimirus suscepit: qui confestim Arrianae impietatis errore destructo Suevos catholicae fidei reddidit.Ferreiro, 198 n8. However, other sources, notably John of Biclarum and Gregory of Tours, plus the minutes of the First Council of Braga, give or imply different occurrences: John that Reccared I of the Visigoths brought about the conversion of both peoples, Gregory that the saintly intercession of Martin of Tours at the bequest of the king Chararic brought it about, and the minutes of First Braga that Ariamir was the first to lift the ban on orthodox Catholic synods. Most scholars have attempted to meld these stories. It has been alleged that Theodemir must have been a successor of Ariamir's, since Ariamir was the first Suevic monarch to lift the ban on Catholic synods; Isidore therefore gets the chronology wrong.Thompson, 87.Ferreiro, 199. Reinhart suggested that Chararic was converted first through the relics of Saint Martin and that Theodemir was converted later through the preaching of Martin of Dumio.Thompson, 86. Felix Dahn equated Chararic with Theodemir, even saying that the latter was the name he took upon baptism. It has also been suggested that Theodemir and Ariamir were the same person and the son of Chararic. Ferreiro believes the conversion of the Suevi was progressive and stepwise and that Thoedemir was responsible for beginning a persecution of the Arians in his kingdom to root out their heresy.Ferreiro, 207. In 569 Theodemir called the First Council of Lugo,Ferreiro, 199 n11. which increased the number of dioceses within the kingdom. In 570 he was attacked by the Arian king of the Visigoths, Leovigild.

On 16 April 1993, with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 819 the Srebrenica enclave was declared a safe area. On 6 May 1993, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 824 further extended the status to Sarajevo, ≈Ωepa, Gora≈æde, Tuzla and Bihaƒá. These cities and territories were placed under the protection of the UN peacekeeping units UNPROFOR. The establishment of the UN Safe Areas is considered today to be one of the most controversial decisions of the United Nations. The resolutions were unclear about the procedure by which these safe areas were to be protected in a war zone like Bosnia and Herzegovina. The resolution created a difficult diplomatic situation because the member states that voted in favor of it were, for political reasons, not willing to take the necessary steps to ensure the security of the safe areas. In 1995 the situation in UN Safe Areas was deteriorating, and it led to a diplomatic crisis which culminated in the Srebrenica massacre; one of the worst atrocities in Europe since World War II. The UN Resolution 819 and 836 had designated Srebrenica a \\"safe area\\" to be protected using \\"all necessary means, including the use of force\\". Continued attacks on UN Safe Areas as well as the continued Siege of Sarajevo also ultimately resulted in NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina named Operation Deliberate Force.

The name of the school sports team is the Davidson Raiders. History The first school opened in Davidson in 1903. The teacher, Harry Ketcheson, was paid for secretarial and janitorial services in addition to teaching. While younger students had continual use of this building during this time, older students used a variety of locations until the Board of Trustees chose a permanent location. A two-story brick building was constructed in 1909 to provide room for all the students. By 1916, the older students had to return to using the original building to make room for the increasing student population. The brick school burned to the ground in December 1916, resulting in the younger students displacing the older students once again. Senior classes were held for a time in the Town Hall. In 1919, another school was constructed with room for K-6 on the first floor, and 7-12 on the second floor. It was built by Poole Construction, which is today known as PCL. It was probably designed by Regina architects Storey and Van Egmond. The student population peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at around 250 students. During this era, Davidson Raiders won multiple provincial championships in football and volleyball. Today, Davidson High has around 250 students from Grades K -12, with a teaching staff of 10.25 and a support staff of 6. Despite a reduced enrolment due to rural depopulation and lower birth rates, DHS offers a variety of extracurricular activities. Athletics includes golf, volleyball, basketball, curling, badminton, and track and field. Science and drama clubs provide other optional activities. The year's events and activities are highlighted annually in the DHS Yearbook. Davidson High students are noted for their high level of participation in sports and an aptitude for creative writing. The school also had developed a tradition for having an active outdoor education program.

She was born and raised in Washington, D.C. to parents working in education, and was the grandchild of formerly enslaved people. It was difficult for a black woman in this time to pursue a career as a working artist. Catlett devoted much of her career to teaching. However, a fellowship awarded to her in 1946 allowed her to travel to Mexico City, where she worked with the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular for twenty years and became head of the sculpture department for the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas. In the 1950s, her main means of artistic expression shifted from print to sculpture, though she never gave up the former. Her work is a mixture of abstract and figurative in the Modernist tradition, with influence from African and Mexican art traditions. According to the artist, the main purpose of her work is to convey social messages rather than pure aesthetics. Her work is heavily studied by art students looking to depict race, gender and class issues. During her lifetime, Catlett received many awards and recognitions, including membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, the Art Institute of Chicago Legends and Legacy Award, honorary doctorates from Pace University and Carnegie Mellon, and the International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement Award in contemporary sculpture. Elizabeth Catlett's \\"Students Aspire\\" piece 1977 at Historically Black College Howard University in Washington, D.C.  Early life Mother and Child, 1939 Catlett was born and raised in Washington, D.C. Both her mother and father were the children of freed slaves, and her grandmother told her stories about the capture of their people in Africa and the hardships of plantation life. Catlett was the youngest of three children. Both of her parents worked in education; her mother was a truant officer and her father taught at Tuskegee University, the then D.C. public school system. Her father died before she was born, leaving her mother to hold several jobs to support the household. Catlett's interest in art began early. As a child she became fascinated by a wood carving of a bird that her father made. In high school, she studied art with a descendant of Frederick Douglass.  Education  Catlett completed her undergraduate studies at Howard University, graduating cum laude, although it was not her first choice. She was also admitted into the Carnegie Institute of Technology but was refused admission when the school discovered she was black. However, in 2007, as Cathy Shannon of E&S; Gallery was giving a talk to a youth group at the August Wilson Center for African American Culture in Pittsburgh, PA, she recounted Catlett's tie to Pittsburgh because of this injustice. An administrator with Carnegie Mellon University was in the audience and heard the story for the first time. She immediately told the story to the school's president, Jared Leigh Cohon, who was also unaware and deeply appalled that such a thing had happened. In 2008, President Cohon presented Catlett with an honorary Doctorate degree and a one- woman show of her art was presented by E&S; Gallery at The Regina Gouger Miller Gallery on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University.Haynes, Monica, \\"Making amends: CMU lauds famed black artist 76 years after it denied her admittance\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 19, 2008. At Howard University, Catlett's professors included artist Lois Mailou Jones and philosopher Alain Locke. She also came to know artists James Herring, James Wells, and future art historian James A. Porter. Her tuition was paid for by her mother's savings and scholarships that the artist earned, and she graduated with honors in 1937. At the time, the idea of a career as an artist was far-fetched for a black woman, so she completed her undergraduate studies with the aim of being a teacher. After graduation, she moved to her mother's hometown of Durham, NC to teach high school. Catlett became interested in the work of landscape artist Grant Wood, so she entered the graduate program of the University of Iowa where he taught. There, she studied drawing and painting with Wood, as well as sculpture with Harry Edward Stinson. Wood advised her to depict images of what she knew best, so Catlett began sculpting images of African-American women and children. However, despite being accepted to the school, she was not permitted to stay in the dormitories, therefore she rented a room off-campus. One of her roommates was future novelist and poet Margaret Walker. Catlett graduated in 1940, one of three to earn the first masters in fine arts from the university, and the first African-American woman to receive the degree. After Iowa, Catlett moved to New Orleans to work at Dillard University, spending the summer breaks in Chicago. During her summers, she studied ceramics at the Art Institute of Chicago and lithography at the South Side Community Art Center. In Chicago, she also met her first husband, artist Charles Wilbert White. The couple married in 1941. In 1942, the couple moved to New York, where Catlett taught adult education classes at the George Washington Carver School in Harlem. She also studied lithography at the Art Students League of New York, and received private instruction from Russian sculptor Ossip Zadkine, who urged her to add abstract elements to her figurative work. During her time in New York, she met intellectuals and artists such as Gwendolyn Bennett, W. E. B. Dubois, Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, Jacob Lawrence, Aaron Douglas, and Paul Robeson. In 1946, Catlett received a Rosenwald Fund Fellowship to travel with her husband to Mexico and study. She accepted the grant in part because at the time American art was trending toward the abstract while she was interested in art related to social themes. Shortly after moving to Mexico that same year, Catlett divorced White. In 1947, she entered the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular, a workshop dedicated to prints promoting leftist social causes and education. There she met printmaker and muralist Francisco Mora, whom she married later that same year. The couple had three children, all of whom developed careers in the arts: Francisco in jazz music, Juan Mora Catlett in filmmaking, and David in the visual arts. The last worked as his mother's assistant, performing the more labor-intensive aspects of sculpting when she was no longer able. In 1948, she entered the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" to study wood sculpture with Jos√© L. Ru√≠z and ceramic sculpture with Francisco Z√∫√±iga. During this time in Mexico, she became more serious about her art and more dedicated to the work it demanded. She also met Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. In 2006, Kathleen Edwards, the curator of European and American art, visited Catlett in Cuernavaca, Mexico and purchased a group of 27 prints for the University of Iowa Museum of Art (UIMA).http://tfaoi.org/aa/7aa/7aa897.htm Catlett donated this money to the University of Iowa Foundation in order to fund the Elizabeth Catlett Mora Scholarship Fund, which supports African-American and Latino students studying printmaking. Elizabeth Catlett Residence Hall on the University of Iowa campus is named in her honor.  Activism  Catlett worked with the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular (TGP) from 1946 until 1966. However, because some of the members were also Communist Party members, and because of her own activism regarding a railroad strike in Mexico City had led to an arrest in 1949, Catlett came under surveillance by the United States Embassy. Eventually, she was barred from entering the United States and declared an \\"undesirable alien.\\" She was unable to return home to visit her ill mother before she died. In 1962, she renounced her American citizenship and became a Mexican citizen. In 1971, after a letter-writing campaign to the State Department by colleagues and friends, she was issued a special permit to attend an exhibition of her work at the Studio Museum in Harlem.  Later years  After retiring from her teaching position at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas, Catlett moved to the city of Cuernavaca, Morelos in 1975. In 1983, she and Mora purchased an apartment in Battery Park City, NY. The couple spent part of the year there together from 1983 until Mora's death in 2002. Catlett regained her American citizenship in 2002. Catlett remained an active artist until her death. The artist died peacefully in her sleep at her studio home in Cuernavaca on April 2, 2012, at the age of 96. She is survived by her 3 sons, 10 grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren. Career Sharecropper, 1952, printed 1970 Very early in her career, Catlett accepted a Public Works of Art Project assignment with the federal government for unemployed artists during the 1930s. However, she was fired for lack of initiative, very likely due to immaturity. The experience gave her exposure to the socially-themed work of Diego Rivera and Miguel Covarrubias. Much of her career was spent teaching, as her original intention was to be an art teacher. After receiving her undergraduate degree, her first teaching position was in the Durham, NC school system. However, she became very dissatisfied with the position because black teachers were paid less. Along with Thurgood Marshall, she participated in an unsuccessful campaign to gain equal pay. After graduate school, she accepted a position at Dillard University in New Orleans in the 1940s. There, she arranged a special trip to the Delgado Museum of Art to see the Picasso exhibit. As the museum was closed to black people at the time, the group went on a day it was closed to the public. She eventually went on to chair the art department at Dillard. Her next teaching position was with the George Washington Carver School, a community alternative school in Harlem, where she taught art and other cultural subjects to workers enrolled in night classes. Her last major teaching position was with the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), starting in 1958, where she was the first female professor of sculpture. One year later, she was appointed the head of the sculpture department despite protests that she was a woman and a foreigner. She remained with the school until her retirement in 1975. When she moved to Mexico, Catlett's first work as an artist was with the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular (TGP), a famous workshop in Mexico City dedicated to graphic arts promoting leftist political causes, social issues, and education. At the TGP, she and other artists created a series of linoleum cuts featuring prominent black figures, as well as posters, leaflets, illustrations for textbooks, and materials to promote literacy in Mexico. Catlett's immersion into the TGP was crucial for her appreciation and comprehension of the signification of ‚Äúmestizaje‚Äù, a blending of Indigenous, Spanish and African antecedents in Mexico, which was a parallel reality to the African American experiences.Women Artists of the Harlem Renaissance, edited by Amy Helene Kirschke, University Press of Mississippi, 2014.

ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/lagcc- ebooks/detail.action?docID=1770987. She remained with the workshop for twenty years, leaving in 1966. Her posters of Harriet Tubman, Angela Davis, Malcolm X and other figures were widely distributed. Although she had an individual exhibition of her work in 1948 in Washington, D.C., her work did not begin to be shown regularly until the 1960s and 1970s, almost entirely in the United States, where it drew interest because of social movements such as the Black Arts Movement and feminism. While many of these exhibitions were collective, Catlett had over fifty individual exhibitions of her work during her lifetime. Other important individual exhibitions include Escuela Nacional de Arte Pl√°ticas of UNAM in 1962, Museo de Arte Moderno in 1970, Los Angeles in 1971, the Studio Museum in Harlem in New York in 1971, Washington, D.C. in 1972, Howard University in 1972, Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1976, Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in 2008, and the 2011 individual show at the Bronx Museum. From 1993 to 2009, her work was regularly on display at the June Kelly Gallery.. In July 2020, while closed to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philadelphia Museum of Art featured Catlett's work in an online exhibit. Catlett's work can be found in major collections such as those of the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Library of Congress, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, National Museum in Prague, the Toledo Museum of Art, the Clark Atlanta University Art Galleries, the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico, the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Iowa, the June Kelly Gallery and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. The Legacy Museum, which opened on April 26, 2018, displays and dramatizes the history of slavery and racism in America, and features artwork by Catlett and others. Awards and recognition During Catlett's lifetime she received numerous awards and recognitions. These include First Prize at the 1940 American Negro Exposition in Chicago, induction into the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana in 1956, the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Iowa in 1996, a 1998 50-year traveling retrospective of her work sponsored by the Newberger Museum of Art at Purchase College, a NAACP Image Award in 2009, and a joint tribute after her death held by the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana and the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional in 2013. Others include an award from the Women's Caucus for Art, the Art Institute of Chicago Legends and Legacy Award, Elizabeth Catlett Week in Berkeley, Elizabeth Catlett Day in Cleveland, honorary citizenship of New Orleans, honorary doctorates from Pace University and Carnegie Mellon, and the International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement Award in contemporary sculpture. The Taller de Gr√°fica Popular won an international peace prize in part because of her achievements . She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1991. By the end of her career, her works, especially her sculptures, sold for tens of thousands of dollars. In 2017, Catlett's alma mater, the University of Iowa, opened a new residence hall that bears her name. Catlett was the subject of an episode of the BBC Radio 4 series An Alternative History of Art, presented by Naomi Beckwith and broadcast on March 6, 2018.\\"Elizabeth Catlett\\", Episode 2, An Alternative History of Art, BBC Radio 4, March 6, 2018.. The Philadelphia Museum of Art featured her in an online exhibition Artistry Catlett is recognized primarily for sculpting and print work. Her sculptures are known for being provocative, but her prints are more widely recognized, mostly because of her work with the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular. Although she never left printmaking, starting in the 1950s, she shifted primarily to sculpture. Her print work consisted mainly of woodcuts and linocuts, while her sculptures were composed of a variety of materials, such as clay, cedar, mahogany, eucalyptus, marble, limestone, onyx, bronze, and Mexican stone (cantera). She often recreated the same piece in several different media. Sculptures ranged in size and scope from small wood figures inches high to others several feet tall to monumental works for public squares and gardens. This latter category includes a 10.5-foot sculpture of Louis Armstrong in New Orleans and a 7.5-foot work depicting Sojourner Truth in Sacramento. Much of her work is realistic and highly stylized two- or three-dimensional figures, applying the Modernist principles (such as organic abstraction to create a simplified iconography to display human emotions) of Henry Moore, Constantin Brancusi and Ossip Zadkine to popular and easily recognized imagery. Other major influences include African and pre-Hispanic Mexican art traditions. Her works do not explore individual personalities, not even those of historical figures; instead, they convey abstracted and generalized ideas and feelings. Her imagery arises from a scrupulously honest dialogue with herself on her life and perceptions, and between herself and \\"the other\\", that is, contemporary society's beliefs and practices of racism, classism and sexism.Kearns, Martha. Gumbo Ya Ya: Anthology of Contemporary African-American Women Artists. New York: MidMarch Press, 1995. Many young artists study her work as a model for themes relating to gender, race and class, but she is relatively unknown to the general public. Her work revolved around themes such as social injustice, the human condition, historical figures, women and the relationship between mother and child. These themes were specifically related to the African- American experience in the 20th century with some influence from Mexican reality. This focus began while she was at the University of Iowa, where she was encouraged to depict what she knew best. Her thesis was the sculpture Mother and Child (1939), which won first prize at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago in 1940. Her subjects range from sensitive maternal images to confrontational symbols of Black Power, and portraits of Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and writer Phyllis Wheatley, as she believed that art can play a role in the construction of transnational and ethnic identity. Her best-known works depict black women as strong and maternal. The women are voluptuous, with broad hips and shoulders, in positions of power and confidence, often with torsos thrust forward to show attitude. Faces tend to be mask-like, generally upturned. Mother and Child (1939) shows a young woman with very short hair and features similar to that of a Gabon mask. A late work Bather (2009) has a similar subject flexing her triceps. Her linocut series The Black Woman Speaks, is among the first graphic series in Western art to depict the image of the American black woman as a heroic and complex human being. Her work was influenced by the Harlem Renaissance movement and the Chicago Black Renaissance in the 1940s and reinforced in the 1960s and 1970s with the influence of the Black Power, Black Arts Movement and feminism. With artists like Lois Jones, she helped to create what critic Freida High Tesfagiorgis called an \\"Afrofemcentrist\\" analytic. The Taller de Gr√°fica Popular pushed her to adapt her work to reach the broadest possible audience, which generally meant balancing abstraction with figurative images. She stated of her time at the TGP, \\"I learned how you use your art for the service of people, struggling people, to whom only realism is meaningful.\\" Critic Michasel Brenson noted the \\"fluid, sensual surfaces\\" of her sculptures, which he said \\"seem to welcome not just the embrace of light but also the caress of the viewer's hand.\\" Ken Johnson said that Ms. Catlett \\"gives wood and stone a melting, almost erotic luminosity.\\" But he also criticized the iconography as \\"generic and clich√©d.\\" However, Catlett was more concerned in the social messages of her work than in pure aesthetics. \\"I have always wanted my art to service my people ‚Äì to reflect us, to relate to us, to stimulate us, to make us aware of our potential.\\" She was a feminist and an activist before these movements took shape, pursuing a career in art despite segregation and the lack of female role models. \\"I don't think art can change things,\\" Catlett said: \\"I think writing can do more. But art can prepare people for change, it can be educational and persuasive in people's thinking.\\" Catlett also acknowledged her artistic contributions as influencing younger black women. She relayed that being a black woman sculptor \\"before was unthinkable. ... There were very few black women sculptors ‚Äì maybe five or six ‚Äì and they all have very tough circumstances to overcome. You can be black, a woman, a sculptor, a print-maker, a teacher, a mother, a grandmother, and keep a house. It takes a lot of doing, but you can do it. All you have to do is decide to do it.\\" Artist statements \\"Art for me must develop from a necessity within my people. It must answer a question, or wake somebody up, or give a shove in the right direction ‚Äî our liberation.\\"Scarborough, Klare, \\"Elizabeth Catlett: Singing the Blues\\", The International Review of African American Art, Vol. 25, No. 4, (2015), p. 51. Selected works *Students Aspire *\\"For My People\\" portfolio, published 1992 by Limited Editions Club, New York *\\"Ralph Ellison Memorial\\", Manhattan *\\"Torso\\", created in 1985, is a carving in mahogany modeled after another of Catlett's pieces, Pensive (b. 1946) a bronze sculpture. The mahogany carving is in the York College, CUNY Fine Art Collection (dimensions: 35' H x 19' W x 16' D). The exaggerated arms and breasts are prominent features of this piece. The crossed arms are broad, with simple geometric shapes and ripples to indicate a shirt with rolled-up sleeves, along with a gentle ridge along the neck. The hands are carved larger than what would be in proportion to the torso. The figure's eyes are painted with a calm, yet steady gaze that signifies confidence. Catlett evokes a strong, working-class black woman similar to her other pieces that she created to portray women's empowerment through expressive poses. Catlett favored materials such as cedar and mahogany because these materials naturally depict brown skin.

Its uses are claimed to be many, for example: \\"squeaky bed springs, psoriasis, dry facial skin, cracked fingers, burns, zits, diaper rash, saddle sores, sunburn, pruned trees, rifles, shell casings, bedsores and radiation burns.\\" History For the first 115 years, Bag Balm was made by a Vermont family-owned business called Dairy Association Co. Inc. In 2014, the family sold the business to a group of investors who changed the name of the company to Vermont's Original, LLC. At the time of the sale, the company had seven employees and was located in Lyndonville, Vermont, and Rock Island, Quebec. The Bag Balm product is known for its characteristic 8-oz green square tins featuring a cow's head and red clovers on the lid. It has been in production since 1899. The formula was purchased by John L. Norris from a Wells River, Vermont, druggist sometime before the turn of the century. Originally, it was used for only cows' udders, but farmers' wives noticed the softness of their husbands' hands, and started using the product themselves. Imitators include Udderly Smooth Udder Cream and Udder Balm. In a 1983 report, Charles Kuralt reported on CBS that \\"upward of 400,000 units were shipped annually\\"; more recent sales figures are not disclosed by the company. Bag Balm was taken to the North Pole by Admiral Byrd, and was used by Allied troops in World War II (to protect weapons from rust). It was used at Ground Zero in New York after 9/11 for the paws of cadaver-sniffing dogs, and it has been used by American troops in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Makeup The active ingredients of Bag Balm are 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate 0.3% (antiseptic) in a petroleum jelly USP and lanolin base. In the past, Bag Balm has been documented as containing 0.005% ethylmercury.Clinical toxicology of commercial products: acute poisoning, home & farm', By Marion N. Gleason, 1957, pg. 292Fisher's contact dermatitis, By Robert L.

Although it weighs some 80 tons, it was dislodged in 1824 by a group of British seamen, intent on showing what the Navy could do. However following complaints from local residents for whom the rock had become a tourist attraction and source of income, the seamen were forced to restore it. Today the Logan Rock still rocks, but with much less ease than it did in the past. The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south-west England from Somerset to Dorset passes by on the cliffs to the north.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End Geography The rock is an eighty-ton granite boulder perched on the edge of the cliffs overlooking the English Channel, on a headland one mile south of Treen. The rock is within Treryn Dinas, an Iron Age promontory fort, or cliff castle, with five lines of fortification.Craig Weatherhill Cornovia: Ancient Sites of Cornwall & Scilly (Alison Hodge 1985; Halsgrove 1997, 2000) The rock is finely balanced due to the actions of weathering, and prior to its restoration in 1824 it could be rocked by applying only a little pressure. As well as the logan stone itself, the name Logan Rock is also applied to the surrounding tip of the headland. Cripp's Cove lies to the east beneath the rock. A number of stacks are located around the edge of Logan Rock including Great Goular, Horrace, and Seghy. The area is within the Treen Cliff Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), notified in 1951 for its marine heathland and rare plants. It is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB),Area Of Outstanding Natural Beauty http://www.aonb.org.uk/ the Penwith Heritage CoastPenwith Heritage Coast http://www.britainexpress.com/countryside/coast/penwith.htm and is owned and managed by the National Trust. The Runnel Stone Marine Conservation Zone was designated on 29 January 2016, covers 20 km¬≤ and is based on a 3.5 km arc measured from the National Coastwatch Institution lookout based at Gwennap Head. Included is much of the coast from Gwennap Head to Hall Dinas on the east side of Treryn Dinas. The MCZ protects habitats ranging from exposed rock on the coast to soft sediments on the sea floor and animals such as pink sea fan (Eunicella verrucosa) which can be found on the eastern side of the headland. Name The original Cornish language name for the rock, recorded in 1870 as Men Amber, is Men Omborth, meaning balanced stone.Weatherhill, Craig. A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-names, 2009. The word \\"logan\\" (properly pronounced \\"logg-un\\") is probably derived from the word \\"log\\", which in an English dialect means \\"to rock\\". In fact, in some parts of the UK, rocking stones or logan stones are called logging stones. Bray, writing in 1832, notes the expression 'to log the child's cradle' in relation to logan stone as an example of ancient British dialect recorded on Dartmoor in Devon. Some have suggested that it comes from a Cornish expression for the movement that someone makes when drunk. Davies Gilbert writes: The Cornish word Leghen means \\"a thin flat stone\\", whilst its root word, Legh, can also mean \\"rickets\\",George, Ken. An Gerlyver Meur, Cornish -English, English ‚Äì Cornish Dictionary, 2009. a disease caused by deficiency of vitamin D and Calcium which can lead to bone deformity. It should also be noted that the name for rocking stones could be a modified form of the Danish word \\"logre,\\" which means 'to wag the tail,' and this suggests possible Norse origin. Danes in particular established a kingdom in Great Britain before 1000 AD, Norway maintained nominal control over the Hebrides in northern Scotland until the late Middle Ages, and Vikings frequently raided along the British coastal areas between 800 and 1000 AD Thus, a Norse origin for the word Logan, while speculative, cannot be ruled out. Story of the rock The Logan Rock (top right) in context The Logan Rock is one of the best known rocking stones for several reasons. For example, Modred, in William Mason's dramatic poem \\"Caractacus,\\" addressing the characters Vellinus and Elidurus, says of the Logan Rock: :::Thither, youths, :::Turn your astonish'd eyes; behold yon huge :::And unhewn sphere of living adamant, :::Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight :::On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems, :::Such is the strange and virtuous property, :::It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch :::Of him whose breast is pure; but to a traitor, :::Tho‚Äô ev‚Äôn a giant‚Äôs prowess nerv‚Äôd his arm, :::It stands as fixt as Snowdon. Pednvounder beach with Logan Rock in the background However, another reason that the Logan Rock of Treen is remembered is that it was the centre of a famous drama. In April 1824, Lieutenant Hugh Goldsmith, R.N. (nephew of the poet Oliver Goldsmith), and ten or twelve of his crew of the cutter HMS Nimble, armed with bars and levers rocked the huge granite boulder until it fell from its cliff-top perch. Goldsmith was apparently motivated to disprove the claim of Dr Borlase, who wrote in Antiquities of Cornwall in 1754 that: The Logan Rock (circled) from the Pednvounder beach sand bar Goldsmith was determined to demonstrate that nothing was impossible when the courage and skill of British seamen were engaged. The Logan Rock slid aside and was caught in a narrow crevice (it did not fall from the cliff as claimed by some). This upset the local residents considerably, since Logan Rock had been used to draw tourists to the area. Treen had become a lucrative tourist destination. Sir Richard R. Vyvyan was particularly unhappy. The local residents demanded that the British Admiralty strip Lieutenant Goldsmith of his Royal Navy commission unless he restored the boulder to its previous position at his own expense. However, Davies Gilbert persuaded the Lords of the Admiralty to lend Lieutenant Goldsmith the required apparatus for replacing the Logan Rock. The Admiralty sent thirteen capstans with blocks and chains from the dock yard at Plymouth, and contributed ¬£25 towards expenses. Gilbert also raised more funds.Three anchor holes drilled into the granite next to the Logan Rock After months of effort, at 4.20pm on Tuesday, 2 November 1824, in front of thousands of spectators and with the help of more than sixty men and block and tackle, the Logan Rock was finally repositioned and returned to \\"rocking condition\\" (Michell 1974). Apparently the total final cost of this enterprise was ¬£130 8s 6d. The original receipt for this expenditure can be found today in The Logan Rock public house in Treen. However, it is not clear how much of the remaining ¬£105 Goldsmith had to make up out of his own pocket. For some time after, the rock was kept chained and padlocked, but eventually these restrictions were removed, and the rock was set free. Tourism declined and this was blamed on the condition of Logan Rock. For a while, Treen was nicknamed 'Goldsmith's Deserted Village'. The anchor holes used to haul the huge rock back into place are still visible in the surrounding rocks. However, it apparently no longer vibrates or \\"logs\\" as easily as it did before.According to a recent visitor to Logan Rock, it would be very difficult to make the Logan Rock move Francis Kilvert on his visit on 27 July 1870: Nonetheless, local historian Craig Weatherhill asserts that a series of rhythmic heaves against the south-western corner of the rock will set it moving, after which, the motion can be kept going with the efforts of one hand. He also mentions another smaller logan on the headland, the Lady Logan Rock, which legend tells is a giantess petrified by curses from the dying husband she had just murdered. On an 1879 visit, Alfred Phillips of Kilburn, found that he ‚Ä≥ ... was able to shake with little difficulty‚Ä≥. In one of her last works, a biography of her childhood, Virginia Woolf mentions visiting Loggan rock with her father and setting it rocking. The episode probably occurred in the early 1890s, when Woolf spent each summer in nearby St Ives. Culture ;Opera Inglis Gundry wrote an opera called The Logan Rock which was premiered at the Minack Theatre in 1956 with Edith Coates singing and Marcus Dods conducting. ;Folklore \\"Observer\\", a letter writer to the Cornishman in 1879, uses the ‚Ä≥venerable belief of our fore-fathers‚Ä≥ who believed in the St Levan witches riding over the Logan Rock, to dispel the contemporary belief, that electric light (which was being introduced to Penzance) was dangerous.

The program was intended to be a continuation of MTV's similar 120 Minutes. The show was hosted by MTV2 VJ Jim Shearer from its debut in 2003 until 2007. It continued without a host, and with sporadic guest appearances by bands, from 2007 to 2011. Every week, an alternative artist or band was the program's guest for an interview, and music videos by that band and other indie artists were played. During each one-hour episode, an average of nine music videos were played.  Format  The program consisted of music videos and, if there was a guest, interview segments with a band conducted by an off-camera interviewer. Usually after the first video, MTV2 would play a \\"shart,\\" which is a short, random video clip, and then play the second music video. Two or three music videos were shown consecutively between commercial breaks. If there is a guest, the program aired five or six separate interview clips with them as well as their current music video. In its previous incarnation, at about ten minutes before Subterranean began, a short lead with Jim Shearer aired in which he informed viewers about the upcoming special guest and notes some of the videos that were to be shown. When the program began, Shearer repeated most of the information from the lead and then introduced the first music video of the program. After about twenty-five minutes into the program, Shearer would introduce the guest and begin the interview. Following the next segment, the latest music video by the special guest artist or band would play. The remainder of the program would features another segment of the interview, the final video, and the sign-off with Shearer. Occasionally, the guest artist would choose the list of videos for the program. Subterranean has also aired special editions dedicated to awards, musical genres and for the viewer- selected top videos of the year. The program was also broadcast online, via MTV.com. The online version of Subterranean includes more interviews with the featured artist, more commentary by Shearer, and extra videos, sometimes chosen by the guest. In August 2008, MTV.com launched a comprehensive back catalogue of past episodes of Subterranean, making the program viewable online. However, it has since been removed as of 2016. Time slot Subterranean originally aired Friday nights at 12 a.m. ET and then moved to Sunday nights at 1 a.m. ET (technically Monday morning). For a few months back in Summer 2008, Subterranean was moved to Saturday nights at 11 p.m ET/10 p.m. CT/8 p.m. PT, sandwiched between You Rock The Deuce and Headbangers Ball. The program moved again on September 11, 2008 and was seen late Thursday nights (early Friday morning) at 1 a.m. ET/midnight CT. On June 7, 2009, Subterranean was moved back to Sunday nights (early Monday mornings) at 2 a.m. ET/1 a.m. CT. As of May 12, 2010, the show moved, this time to early Wednesday mornings at 5 a.m. ET/4 a.m. CT/2 a.m. PT. Subterranean aired its last episode on September 14, 2011.

It lies on the eastern side of the River Ouse about south of York. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 470, increasing to 516 at the 2011 census. It was historically part of the East Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. Between 1974 and 1996 it had been part of the Selby district. History Naburn was a predominantly agricultural community with local farms prospering on the rich alluvial soil. The village was until the mid 20th century virtually totally owned by the Palmes family. On the Northern boundary was Naburn Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, formerly known as York City Asylum, until its closure in 1988. Adjacent to it was Fulford maternity hospital. In 1739 a ferry was situated just to the west of Naburn Hall, but by the early 19th century was in competition with a horse and foot road that led from the village street past the hall and across the ings to a ferry close to Acaster Malbis village. The latter ferry is said to have been started by the Thompsons of Escrick after Beilby Thompson married Dame Sarah Dawes to provide a connexion with her estate at Acaster. Due to increased traffic, it proved a nuisance to the Palmes family at Naburn Hall. In 1824 they closed the road with the ferry moving to a point near the middle of the village. The new ferry, for passengers and vehicles, was later worked by wheel and chain and was closed in 1956. A weir was made at Naburn, a mile downstream from the village, in 1741 and a 'dam' or weir and a lock were opened in 1757. As a result, this created an island on which a water-mill was later built. A second, larger, lock was constructed beside the old one in 1888 and opened by Prince Albert Victor. The York-Selby railway line crossed the River Ouse just north of the village by way of a swing bridge built in 1871. Naburn station was closed to passengers in 1953 and to goods in 1964. In 1983 the Selby Diversion was opened and the line via Naburn closed and turned into a railway path and cycle route to provide a safe and attractive route between York and Selby for pedestrians and cyclists- forming part of the Sustrans network Route 65. There were three alehouses in Naburn in the 1750s and 1760s, but by 1822 only the \\"Horse Shoe\\" remained. In 1872 it was renamed the \\"Blacksmiths' Arms\\". In 1823 Naburn was in the parishes of Acaster Malbis and St George, York, in the Wapentake of Ouse and Derwent and the East Riding of Yorkshire. Within the village was a chapel of ease, a Methodist chapel, and an endowed school for ten boys. Population at the time was 366. Occupations included fifteen farmers and yeomen, two of whom were also butchers, two shoemakers, a wheelwright, a shopkeeper, a corn miller, a tailor, a lock keeper, and the landlord of The Horse shoe public house who was also a blacksmith. Resident were a schoolmaster, the ecclesiastical parish curate, and three Esquire gentlemen. A carrier operated between the village and York once a week.Baines, Edward (1823): History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York, p. 370, 371 A sewerage works for York, covering about 20 acres, was opened beside the river in Naburn in 1895 and has been extended several times. A narrow gauge railway operated at the sewage works and consisted of a short stretch of line and a siding. Before the Norman Conquest, Naburn was held by two Saxons, named Turgot and Turchil. After the Conquest, it was given, to Robert de Todeni, one of the Conquerors standard-bearers, from whom the Rutland family is descended. In 1086 there were two main estates recorded at Naburn, the one belonging to Robert de Todeni and the other to the King. The larger estate passed by way of marriage to the Aubignys until it passed, in 1284-5, to Robert de Ros. The Ros interest was mentioned as late as 1434. About 1200 the Watervill were lords of the manor of Naburn under the Aubignys. Richard de Watervill assigned the manor to William Palmes in 1226 and the estate remained in the Palmes family until the death of Commander George Bryan Palmes in 1974. The current head of the Palmes family is Antony Bryan Palmes (born 4 May 1930). Geography Most of the parish is a little over above sea level with the extensive nearby ings being even lower. The village is surrounded by arable farmland and patches of woodland. The soil consists of the alluvium of the Ouse flood-plain and patches of glacial sand and gravel east of the village and in the north-west is covered with outwash sand and clay. Streams draining into the Ouse include Wood Dike, which forms a short section of the southern parish boundary, and Howden Dike, which joins the river at the north end of the village. The Ouse forms the entire parish boundary on the west. Naburn is 2.5 miles north-west of Deighton, and about the same distance west of Crockey Hill, though the road distance is a mile longer. To the west of Naburn, the lack of a road crossing over the River Ouse means a long road journey to the relatively close villages of Acaster Malbis and Bishopthorpe. Naburn is 3 miles north of Stillingfleet and 4 miles south of York. Governance Naburn lies in the Wheldrake Ward of the City of York unitary authority. As of 2019 it is represented by Julian Sturdy who is a member of the Conservative Party. Demography The population in 1801 was 363, increasing to 574 in 1901. The total had fallen to 537 by 1951, 473 by 1961, and 371 by 1971. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 470. Economy Naburn has one public house, the Blacksmiths Arms and a small sub post office. Transport Arriva run a bus service that stops in the village as part of its York to Drax route. The village lies on Sustrans National Cycle Route 65, which provides an off road link into York. Education There has been a school in the village since 1743. The school was replaced by a National school, built nearby in Back Lane, in 1871, and enlarged in 1889. It is now a Church of England Primary School. As of 2017, the school falls within the catchment area of Fulford School for secondary education. Religious sites A farm-house called Naburn Hill or White Cock Hall, beside the York road in the north-east of the parish, was used for Wesleyan Methodist worship in 1851 and was registered for the purpose in 1853, but by 1896 had fallen into disuse. The church of St. Matthew was rebuilt on its present site in 1854. The Palmes family had a private chapel at Naburn Hall. Sports and leisure The Yorkshire Ouse Sailing Club, founded in 1938, has a club house near the former ferry. At the north end of the village, a marina was opened in 1970. Landmarks Naburn Hall is a Grade II listed building. Naburn Hall had been in possession of the Palmes family since 1226 and was passed down the generations until 1974. The house was rebuilt in 1735 and underwent alterations in 1818 and enlargement 1870. It consists of a three-storeyed square main block, with a two-storeyed wing. The 18th-century coach-house has a clock turret and bellcot. Acres House was built in 1774 and formed part of the old hospital.

If subset of a real or complex vector space , then we define the Minkowski functional or gauge of to be the function , valued in the extended real numbers, defined by :} for every , where recall the infimum of the of the empty set is defined to be positive infinity (which is not a real number so that would then not be real-valued). If the set is not empty then the infimum will necessarily be a non-negative real number. This property of being non-negative stands in contrast to other classes of functions, such as sublinear functions, that do allow negative values. In functional analysis, is usually assumed to have properties (e.g. such as being absorbing in ) that will guarantee that for every , this set } is not empty precisely because this results in being real- valued. Moreover, is also often assumed to have more properties, such as being an absorbing disk in , since these properties guarantee that will be a (real- valued) seminorm on . In fact, every seminorm on is equal to the Minkowski functional of any subset of satisfying } (where all three of these sets are necessarily absorbing in and the first and last are also disks). Thus every seminorm (which is a function defined by purely algebraic properties) can be associated (non-uniquely) with an absorbing disk (which is a set with certain geometric properties) and conversely, every absorbing disk can be associated with its Minkowski functional (which will necessarily be a seminorm). These relationships between seminorms, Minkowski functionals, and absorbing disks is a major reason why Minkowski functionals are studied and used in functional analysis. In particular, through these relationships, Minkowski functionals allow one to \\"translate\\" certain geometric properties of a subset of into certain algebraic properties of a function on .  Definition  Observe that for any , if and only if } is not empty. Recall that we may partially extend 's arithmetic operations to include , where for all non-zero real . Note that and remain undefined. ;Some conditions making a gauge real-valued In the field of convex analysis, the map taking on the value of is not necessarily an issue. However, in functional analysis we almost always want to be real-valued (i.e. to never take on the value of ), which happens if and only if the set } is non-empty for every . In order for to be real-valued, it suffices for the origin of to belong to the algebraic interior (or core) of in . If is absorbing in , where recall that this implies that , then the origin belongs to the algebraic interior of in and thus is real-valued. Characterizations of when is real-valued are given below.  Motivating examples  ;Example 1 Consider a normed vector space , with the norm and let be the unit ball in . Then for every , we have . Thus the Minkowski functional is just the norm on . ;Example 2 Let be a vector space without topology with underlying scalar field . Let be any linear functional on (not necessarily continuous). Fix . Let be the set :} and let be the Minkowski functional of . Then : for all . Note that has the following properties: #It is subadditive: . #It is homogeneous: for all scalars . #It is nonnegative: . Therefore, is a seminorm on , with an induced topology. This is characteristic of Minkowski functionals defined via \\"nice\\" sets. There is a one-to-one correspondence between seminorms and the Minkowski functional given by such sets. What is meant precisely by \\"nice\\" is discussed in the section below. Notice that, in contrast to a stronger requirement for a norm, need not imply . In the above example, one can take a nonzero from the kernel of . Consequently, the resulting topology need not be Hausdorff.  Common conditions making gauges into seminorms  So that we have , we will henceforth assume that . If is absorbing in then one may show that is positive homogeneous i.e. that for all real , where }. If is a non- negative real-valued function on that is positive homogeneous then the sets } and } satisfy and ; if in addition is absolutely homogeneous then both and are balanced. If is convex and the origin to belong to the algebraic interior of , then is a non-negative sublinear functional on , which implies in particular that it is subadditive and positive homogeneous. In order for to be a seminorm, it suffices for to be a disk (i.e. convex and balanced) and absorbing in , which are the most common assumption placed on . = Gauges of absorbing disks = Arguably the most common requirements placed on a set to guarantee that is a seminorm are that be an absorbing disk in . Due to how common these assumptions are, we now investigate the properties of a Minkowski functional when is an absorbing disk. Since all of the results mentioned above made few (if any) assumptions on , they can be applied in this special case. ;Convexity and subadditivity A simple geometric argument that shows convexity of implies subadditivity is as follows. Suppose for the moment that . For all , we have . Since is convex and , is also convex. Therefore, . By definition of the Minkowski functional , we have :p_Kleft( frac{1}{2} x + frac{1}{2} yright) le r + epsilon = frac{1}{2} p_K(x) + frac{1}{2} p_K(y) + epsilon. But the left hand side is so that :. Since was arbitrary, it follows that , which is the desired inequality. The general case is obtained after the obvious modification. Note: Convexity of , together with the initial assumption that the set } is nonempty, implies that is absorbing. ;Balancedness and absolute homogeneity Notice that being balanced implies that :lambda x in r K quad mbox{if and only if} quad x in frac{r}{lambda} K. Therefore :p_K (lambda x) = inf left{r > 0: lambda x in r K right} = inf left{r > 0: x in frac{r}{lambda} K right} = inf left{  lambda  frac{r}{  lambda  } > 0: x in frac{r}{lambda} K right} = lambda p_K(x). = Algebraic properties = Let be a real or complex vector space and let be an absorbing disk in . * is a seminorm on . * is a norm on if and only if does not contain a non-trivial vector subspace. * For any scalar , . * If is an absorbing disk in and then * If is a set satisfying } then is absorbing in and , where is the Minkowski functional associated with (i.e. the guage of ). * In particular, if is as above and is any seminorm on , then if and only if }. * If satisfies then . = Topological properties = Let be a real or complex topological vector space (TVS) (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex) and let be an absorbing disk in . * : where is the topological interior and is the closure of in . * Note that we did not assume that was continuous or that had any topological properties. * is continuous if and only if is a neighborhood of the origin in . * If is continuous then: * }, and * }.  Properties (minimal requirements)  In this section, we will investigate the most general case of the gauge of any subset of . The more common special case where is assumed to be an absorbing disk in is discussed after this section. However, all results in this section may be applied to the case where is an absorbing disk. = Notation = As before, let be any subset of a real or complex vector space . We will make heavy use the following types of sets (which are defined as usual) to characterize or deduce properties of Minkowski functionals. :Notation: If is any set of scalars then let }. Thus for any real and , }, and }, and we define the sets , , etc. similarly. To simplify the discussion, we also define and . Also, if is any such interval or set of scalars then for every , we will let denote }; for instance }. ;Examples * Let and . If then is just the interval ; that is, it is the open line segment lying strictly between the origin and .

However, we do have and . ;Properties If is a set of scalars, , and then we will use the following basic properties without comment: * Inclusion in a set: if and only if for all real . Moreover, if and only if for all scalars . * Exclusion from a set: if and only if for all real ; if neither nor is infinite then we may replace \\"\\" with \\"\\" in the last condition. Moreover, if and only if for all non-zero scalars . * Note that in contrast to inclusion, for all scalars if and only if . = Seminorms and Minkowski functionals = The following corollary mainly summarizes and combines the results that are established in the basic properties section below. Most of this theorem's statements follow immediately from the results established in the basic properties section below. One statement that hasn't yet been proven, and which we now prove, is that a convex subset of that satisfies is absorbing in . Suppose that is a vector space over the field , where is or , and assume that . Observe that a set is absorbing in if and only if } is absorbing in every 1-dimensional vector subspace , where . Thus, it is necessary and sufficient to show that contains an open -ball around the origin in . The condition implies that every \\"open ray\\" in starting at the origin (i.e. a set of the form for some ) contains an element of so that in particular, and (where so that ) so that now the convexity of makes it clear that for every , the convex set is a line segment (possibly open, closed, or half-closed, and possibly bounded or unbounded) containing an open sub-interval that contains the origin. If then this shows that is absorbing in so assume that . Note that , where , and that . Notice that the set , which is contained in , is a union of two line segments intersecting at the origin (with each containing the origin in an open sub- interval) so that its convex hull, which is contained in the convex set , clearly contains a quadrilateral having the origin in its interior. This shows that is absorbing in , as desired. Recall that the hypothesis of statement (6) allows us conclude that for all and all scalars satisfying . Since every scalar is of the form for some real where and is real if and only if is real, the results stated in (6) follow immediately from the aforementioned conclusion, from the strict positive homogeneity of , and from the positive homogeneity of when is real-valued.  Characterization of seminorms with Minkowski functionals  Note that in this next theorem, which follows immediately from the above corollary, we do not assume that is absorbing in but instead deduce that is balanced, and that we do not assume that is balanced (which is a property that is often required to have) but we instead assume the weaker condition that for all scalars satisfying . The common requirement that be convex is also weakened to only requiring that be convex = Positive sublinear functions and Minkowski functionals = One may show that a real-valued subadditive function on a TVS is continuous at the origin if and only if it is uniformly continuous, where if in addition is non- negative, then is continuous if and only if } is an open neighborhood in . If is subadditive and satisfies , then is continuous if and only if its absolute value is continuous. A positive sublinear function is a real homogeneous function that satisfies the triangle inequality. It follows immediately from the results below that if } then . ;Correspondence between open convex sets and positive continuous sublinear functions Let be an open convex subset of . If then let and otherwise let be arbitrary. Let be the Minkowski functional of where is a continuous sublinear function on since is convex, absorbing, and open ( however is not necessarily a seminorm since it is not necessarily absolutely homogeneous). From the properties of Minkowski functionals, we have } so that }. But :}, as desired. ‚àé = Characterizing Minkowski functionals = The next theorem shows that Minkowski functionals are exactly those functions that have a certain purely algebraic property that is used widely. This theorem can be easily extended to characterize certain classes of -valued maps (e.g. real-valued sublinear functions) in terms of Minkowski functionals. In particular, we describe later how every real homogeneous function (such as linear functionals) can be written in terms of a unique Minkowski functional having a certain property. We prove only that (1) implies (3) since afterwards the rest of the theorem follows immediately from the basic properties of Minkowski functionals described later; properties that we will assume the reader is familiar with and use without mention. So assume that is a function such that for all and all real and let }. Note that for all real we have so by taking for instance, we can conclude that either or . Let . We must show that . We will now show that if or then , so that in particular, we will conclude that . So suppose that or and note that in either case we have for all real . Now if then this implies that that for all real (since ), which implies that , as desired. Similarly, if then for all real , which implies that , as desired. Thus, we will henceforth assume that a positive real number and that (note, however, that we have not yet ruled out the possibility that is or ). Recall that just like , the function satisfies for all real . Since , if and only if so we may assume without loss of generality that and it remains to show that . Since , we have , which implies that (so in particular, we now know that ). It remains to show that , which recall happens if and only if . So assume for the sake of contradiction that and let and be such that , where note that implies that . Then . ‚àé = Minkowski functionals and negative values = The definitions of strict positive homogeneity that was given for -valued functions on immediately extends, without change, to functions that are valued in other codomains. :Definition: Let be a function on valued in (or even in ). We say that is strictly positively homogeneous if for all and all positive real . If never takes the value then we say that is non-negative homogeneous if for all and all non-negative real . Note that if are functions such that is well-defined (i.e. there is no such that and are infinite and equal), then if both and are strictly positively homogeneous (which happens if and only if they are both Minkowski functionals) then so is the map . It's natural to ask if every function that is strictly positively homogeneous is equal to the difference of two Minkowski functionals. The answer can easily be shown to be yes by using with the following definitions. ;Positive and negative parts :Definition and notation: For any function , let and be defined by } and }. We call the positive part of and call the negative part of . For every , at least one of and is equal to (or said differently, the function } is identically ) and . Moreover, and are the only -valued functions with these properties. That is, if satisfy } and then and . ;Characterization  Linear functionals and Minkowski functionals  :Definition: Call a map real homogeneous if for all and all real . Clearly, is real homogeneous if and only if it is non-negative homogeneous and for all . :Definition: Call a map additive if for all , is well-defined and . If a map is additive then either is constant and infinite or else it is real-valued, so it is only useful to consider real-valued additive maps. :Definition: A real linear functional on is a map that is additive and real homogeneous. If is additive then and for every , for all rational real . Thus an additive function is almost real homogeneous and it is a linear functional if and only if it is also strictly positively homogeneous. Thus, we could have equivalently defined a real linear functional as being an additive map that is equal to the difference of two real-valued Minkowski functionals.  Commuting with negation  :Notation: Let denote negation on (i.e. for every ). :Definition: We say that a function on commutes with negation if . That is, if for all . Every -valued additive function commutes with negation, as does every real homogeneous function. The following observations shows that a function that commutes with negation is completely determined by negation and the single -valued map (the same is also true of ).  Minkowski functionals and real homogeneous functions  The following theorem shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence, determined by the negation operation , between (‚Ñù-valued) real homogeneous functions and -valued Minkowski functionals that satisfy (that is, for all ). = Basic properties = ;Summary of properties of Minkowski functionals We summarize some of the more important results found in the following theorem where throughout and are any subsets of and is arbitrary. * for all real always, without any requirements at all. ** If is real-valued, which happens if and only if , then the above equality will also hold with . * If then if and only if . ** The proofs of the many properties listed below become straightforward exercises once this characterization is proven and then the remaining properties follow easily once it is shown that every Minkowski functional is strictly positive homogeneous. ** Assuming that , if then , and the converse will hold if contains }. * if and only if . ** It follows that whenever satisfies ; in particular, could be the first or last of these three sets or also . * is subadditive (i.e. satisfies the triangle inequality) if and only if is convex.

However, the set (or , or others) may have some or all of these properties and since one may use any of these sets to try to deduce properties of this map. That is, one is always free to use whatever set is best suited for the problem at hand (so as long satisfies , of course) and then change to any other such set. * The value(s) of on a set of the form (where ) are completely determined by the value of at any one point of . In general, the values of on and its values on the complement are completely independent. ** This is the reason why characterizations such as: if and only if are useful. The latter condition requires no change to and involves only the open ray , which is all that the value of depends on, while the former condition involves scaling the entire set . ;Properties of Minkowski functionals {{Math theoremname=Theoremmath_statement= Let be any subset of a real or complex vector space and let be a real number.

In the equality Most numbered statements in the theorem above have an unnumbered sub-list. We prove only the numbered statements and some of the less obvious statements found in the unnumbered sub-lists. All other statements are either direct consequences of the numbered statement under which it is found, or else will become straightforward exercises once all the numbered statements are proven. Proof of (1) and (2): Straightforward exercises. Proof of (3): The equivalence of (a) and (d) will follow immediately from (4) (or (5)), and the proofs of the remaining equivalences in (3) are straightforward exercises. ‚àé Proof of (4): Let LHS (i.e. Left Hand Side) be the statement \\"\\" and let RHS be the statement \\"\\". We must show that LHS is true if and only if RHS is true. If then LHS and RHS are both false so henceforth assume that . If then LHS is clearly false and RHS is also false since so henceforth assume that . If then LHS is false (since ) and (2) gives so that in particular, RHS is also false. So henceforth assume that . Observe that LHS is true if and only if , which happens if and only if there exists some real such that and , where this can be restated more succinctly as , which is exactly the statement RHS. Thus LHS is true if and only if RHS is true, which completes the proof of (4). ‚àé Proof of (5): Note that if and only if for every for every , which by (4) happens if and only if for every , as desired. The proof of the claim that if then if and only if this is true for will be a straightforward exercise once (7) is proven. Then the claim that this equality holds for if and only if contains } will be easily seen with the proof of (10). ‚àé Proof of (6): The main characterization in (6) is just a combination of (4) and (5). The characterization of is now readily verified, and its generalization to for positive will follow immediately once (7) is proven. ‚àé Proof of (7): Fix . If then (1) implies that so assume . Note that if and only if if and only if if and only if , in which case so we're done. So assume , which (as was just shown) implies that and . Since , by (6) we have and for every so that multiplying by gives and for every . Since was arbitrary, it follows that and for every , which is equivalent to , as desired. ‚àé Proof of (8): The characterizations of when are now deduced easily from the following observation: if and are any -valued functions on , then if and only if } for all real (importantly, note that it is not necessary to check that these set equalities hold for or ). Note that this characterization of remains true if all instances of \\"\\" are replaced by \\"\\".

Similarly, (7) shows that this characterization of remains true if \\"\\" is replaced by \\"\\". For the statement involving the set , it is readily verified that so that , and the rest now follows with the help of (5). ‚àé Proof of (9): Immediate. Proof of (10): Recall that } so by using (7), we have :, so (8) implies that . The rest of (10) follows easily. ‚àé Proof of (11): Immediate.

It has even been suggested, based on the lack of a signatory for the diocese of Dumio in the concilar acts, that Miro himself may have represented that see.Arias, 59, who cites the Parochiale Suevum in support. The Parochiale refers to Ad Dumio familia seruorum, which is similar to sueuorum. Miro also maintained \\"intimate and friendly\\" relations with Martin of Dumio, the Archbishop of Braga and Metropolitan of Gallaecia. Martin's principal work, Formula Vitae Honestae, is dedicated to him, and the Exhortatio Humilitatis, printed among Martin's works, is also probably addressed to him. Indeed, Martin advised Miro's counsellors to read his Formula so as to be able better to counsel the king.Arias, 28. In the same year as the council of Braga, Miro conducted an expedition against the Ruccones (Runcones) of Cantabria, possibly a Basque tribe, with the intention of expanding his kingdom.Arias, 30. This attack on a people within the Gothic kingdom was perhaps an excuse for Gothic reprisals against the Sueves. In 573 Leovigild subdued the region of \\"Sabaria\\" (probably between Zamora and Salamanca) with the likely intention of preempting Miro. In 574 he \\"restored the province [of Cantabria] to his dominion.\\" In response, Miro sent envoys to Guntram, the Frankish King of Burgundy and a consistent thorn in Leovigild's side, but they were intercepted and detained on the way by Leovigild's ally, Chilperic I, the Frankish king of Neustria.Arias, 31. In 575 Leovigild invaded the \\"Aregensian Mountains\\" near Ourense and captured \\"the lord of the region, along with his wife, children, and riches, bringing the region under his power.\\" Aspidius, the \\"lord of the region\\", may have been a Hispano-Roman landowner who had sided with the Suevi. In 576 Leovigild again marched to the southern frontier of Galicia (the Douro) and menaced the small kingdom, even founding the city of Villa Gothorum (modern Toro). Miro sued for peace, and obtained it for a short time. In 580 Miro endeavoured to support Leovigild's Catholic son Hermenegild in rebellion. For the events surrounding Miro's death, the contemporary and near-contemporary accounts conflict. According to Gregory of Tours, in 583 Miro led an army to raise the siege of Seville by Leovigild, but the two kings held a conference before Miro had reached Seville and he returned to Galicia, where he died shortly after, supposedly from the effects of the bad air and water of Baetica. On the other hand, two Iberian chroniclers, John of Biclar and Isidore of Seville, concur that he died before Seville while assisting Leovigild with the siege of the town. Modern scholarship favours Gregory's interpretation, taking into account Miro's alliances with Francia and Byzantium, Suevic animosity to the Goths, and the shared Catholic faith of Sueves and rebels.Arias, 32. He was succeeded in provincia Gallacci√¶ by his adolescent son Eboric.FMG He also left a widow, Sisegu(n)tia, who married Andeca, who deposed Eboric and took to ruling in Gallaccia Suevorum regnum.

The machine was made up of connected sections which flex and bend as waves pass; it is this motion which is used to generate electricity. Developed by the now defunct Scottish company Pelamis Wave Power (formerly Ocean Power Delivery), the Pelamis became the first offshore wave machine to generate electricity into the grid, when it was first connected to the UK grid in 2004. Pelamis Wave Power then went on to build and test five additional Pelamis machines: three first-generation P1 machines, which were tested in a farm off the coast of Portugal in 2009, and two second-generation machines, the Pelamis P2, were tested off Orkney between 2010 and 2014. The company went into administration in November 2014, with the intellectual property transferred to the Scottish Government body Wave Energy Scotland. Operation The Pelamis machine is an offshore wave energy converter, operating in water depths greater than 50m. The machine consists of a series of semi-submerged cylindrical sections linked by hinged joints. As waves pass along the length of the machine, the sections move relative to one another. The wave-induced motion of the sections is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors via smoothing hydraulic accumulators. The hydraulic motors drive electrical generators to produce electricity. Electricity from all the joints is fed down a single umbilical cable to a junction on the sea bed. Several devices can be connected and linked to shore through a single seabed cable. Principle The Pelamis is an attenuating wave energy converter. The machine responds to the curvature of the waves (their shape) rather than the wave height. As waves can only reach a certain curvature before naturally breaking, this limits the range of motion through which the machine must move but maintains large motion at the joints in small waves. Projects =P2 Pelamis testing at EMEC= The P2 Pelamis design was Pelamis Wave Power's second generation Pelamis machine. The Pelamis P2 is 180m long, 4m diameter and approximately 1350 tonnes in weight. Consisting of five tube sections and four flexible joints, the design is longer and fatter than the previous P1 design. In 2010, Pelamis Wave Power began tests of the first Pelamis P2 machine at the European Marine Energy Centre, Orkney, Scotland. The machine was owned by the German utility company, E.ON, and was the UK's first commercial supply contract in the marine energy sector. In March 2010 Pelamis Wave Power announced a second order for a P2 machine, from ScottishPower Renewables, part of Iberdrola Renovables. This second machine was first installed at EMEC in May 2012. The two utility companies announced that they will work together to share and collaborate in testing of the P2 Pelamis technology. Following the demise of the company, the P2-001 device was acquired by Wave Energy Scotland, having completed over 15,000 hours of operation. The device was decommissioned in April 2016 and sold to the Orkney Island Council for ¬£1. The other device, P2-002 was sold to the European Marine Energy Centre for use as a test rig. =Projects formerly in development= E.ON and ScottishPower Renewables announced plans to build larger projects using Pelamis machines in the waters off Orkney's west coast. Both companies won leases in 2010 from The Crown Estate, who own the seabed around the UK, for projects of up to 50 MW. The \\"Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters Leasing Round\\" was the world's first commercial scale wave and tidal energy leasing opportunity. Development history =Prototype Pelamis Machine= The Pelamis Prototype machine at EMEC, Orkney, Scotland, 2007 Pelamis Wave Power tested their first full-scale prototype at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, Scotland between 2004 and 2007. The machine, which was rated at 750 kW, was the world's first offshore wave power machine to generate electricity into the grid system. The prototype was 120m long and 3.5m in diameter. It consisted of four tube sections linked by three, shorter, and power conversion modules =Agu√ßadoura Wave Farm= In 2008 Pelamis tested three first generation, P1 Pelamis waves at the Agu√ßadoura Wave Farm. Located off the northwest coast of Portugal near P√≥voa de Varzim, the farm had an installed capacity of 2.25 MW and was the world's first multiple machine wave power project. The project was part funded by Portuguese utility Enersis, at the time owned by Australian global investment company Babcock & Brown. The farm first generated electricity in July 2008 but was taken offline in November 2008 at the same time as Babcock & Brown encountered financial difficulties.  Etymology  Pelamis platurus is a yellow-bellied sea snake that lives in tropical and subtropical waters. It prefers shallow inshore waters.  Hailong 1  The Hailong (Dragon) 1 is a Chinese wave energy machine reported to be a near perfect copy of the Pelamis which began testing in 2015 in the South China Sea. It was reported to have been based on IP stolen from Pelamis during a 2011 heist. Images Image:Pelamis Wellenkraftwerk Portugal 1.JPG2 of 3 Pelamis machines in the harbour of Peniche, Portugal.

The Ministry of Technology was established by the incoming government of Harold Wilson in October 1964 as part of Wilson's ambition to modernise the state for what he perceived to be the needs of the 1960s. The pledge was included in the Labour Party's 1964 general election manifesto: \\"A Labour Government will .. [set] up a Ministry of Technology to guide and stimulate a major national effort to bring advanced technology and new processes into industry.\\" History =Foundation= Wilson chose to appoint Frank Cousins, General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, who had not previously sat in Parliament. Cousins had played a significant role in supporting Wilson's campaign to become leader of the Labour Party. C. P. Snow was created Baron Snow of Leicester so that he could play the role of parliamentary secretary in the House of Lords for the ministry, a role he carried out from October 1964 until April 1966. Professor Patrick Blackett wrote an outline, \\"The Case for a Ministry of Technology\\" in September 1964 and worked with Snow, Cousins and two senior civil servants, Sir Maurice Dean and Christopher Herzig to set up the ministry from scratch. =Under Tony Benn= Ministry of Technology mobile cinema 1967 However, Cousins' performance in the role was disappointing, partly because Cousins was new to the political scene but also because he disagreed with Government economic policy in general. By the time of the 1966 general election, Wilson was telling Tony Benn to prepare to take over because \\"I can't think Frank Cousins will stay long. He's not fit anyway.\\" In the event, Cousins resigned on 3 July 1966 when the Prices and Incomes Bill was published, and was duly replaced by Benn. Benn was then closely associated with Wilson and worked with him to build the Ministry into a powerful voice within Whitehall. Both he and Wilson believed in government assistance to industry to adopt new technology. The Ministry gradually gained extra functions, taking over responsibility for aircraft supply from the Ministry of Aviation on 15 February 1967 and absorbing the Ministry of Power on 6 October 1969; it therefore became one of the largest and most powerful in government. =Demise= When Edward Heath took over as Prime Minister after the 1970 general election, he had no commitment to maintain Wilson's new Ministries. In October 1970, Heath merged the Ministry with the Board of Trade to create the Department of Trade and Industry; at the same time, the responsibility for military aircraft procurement devolved to the short-lived Ministry of Aviation Supply.

The measurement system based on the hvat is called hvatski sistem (literally \\"hvat system\\"). 1 hvat equals: * 6 √ó stopa (stopa is analogous to Austrian \\"Vienna foot\\" = 0.316080640 metres.); * 72 √ó palac (1 stopa = 12 √ó palac; palac is analogous to Austrian \\"Vienna inch\\" = 2.6340053 cm); * 1.89648384 metres. 1 metre equals 0.527292 hvats. Surface The hvat measurement system had been developed from Austrian units of measurement, used in Croatia and Vojvodina (northern part of Serbia) while they were parts of Austro-Hungarian Empire (Austria-Hungary). Hvat is equal to Austrian measure Viennese klafters. In the hvat system, hvat is used as a basis for the unit of area, called \\"kvadratni hvat\\" (Serbian) or \\"ƒçetvorni hvat\\" (both Serbian and Croatian). This could be translated as \\"square hvat\\" and is analogous to square fathom. The square hvat and other derived units in the hvat system are still sometimes encountered in measuring land. 1 square hvat equals 3.596652 square meters; 1 square meter equals 0.278036431 square hvats. =Derived units= Square hvat is used as the basis for other units of surface in the hvat system. * motika; one motika = 200 square hvats = 719.3304 square meters. * jutro (\\"morning\\", compare the unit Morgen) or Joch in Austria ; one jutro = 8 motika = 1,600 square hvats = 5,754.6432 square meters. * lanac; one lanac = 10 motika = 2,000 square hvats = 7,193.304 square meters. When used today, the units are often rounded to the nearest square meter. Thus, jutro is rounded to 5,755 square meters and lanac is rounded to 7,192 square meters. When more precision is needed, katastarsko jutro (meaning cadastral jutro) is used, that equals exactly 0.5754642 hectares (5,754.642 square meters). Other historical units that are sometimes used to measure surface together with the square hvat are: * dulum; one dulum equals 1,000 square meters. * ≈°inik; one ≈°inik equals 1,000 square meters. =Map scales= Maps depicting land measured in hvat system are drawn in following scales: * 1:720 (1 palac = 10 hvats); * 1:1440 (1 palac = 20 hvats); * 1:2880 (1 palac = 40 hvats). Volume Hvat is also used as a basis for the unit of volume, called \\"kubni hvat\\", often colloquially abbreviated to \\"kubik\\" in both languages (though note that the same abbreviation is used for cubic meter). This could be translated as \\"cubic hvat\\" (analogous to cubic fathom). If calculated from hvat, one cubic hvat would equal 6.820992 cubic meters.

It was held in downtown by the Phoenix Civic Plaza and the America West Arena, prior to the introduction of the state's baseball stadium, Bank One Ballpark. The United States Grand Prix lasted in Phoenix for three years, but was inexplicably dropped by Formula One management. There were no further Formula One races in the US until the Indianapolis Motor Speedway first held a Grand Prix in 2000. Summary In 1986 former race car driver and businessman Guy Gonyea approached then Mayor Terry Goddard about the possibility of the city of Phoenix hosting a round of the FIA Formula One World Championship in order to increase the city‚Äôs world-wide visibility as a major tourist destination. With the support of Goddard and city officials Gonyea conducted an extensive feasibility study, gaining the support of 37 of the city's leading business organizations including the Chamber of Commerce, the Fiesta Bowl collegiate football committee and Congressman Jon Kyl. Having gained overwhelming support, Gonyea subsequently met in Paris, France with then President of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) J-M Balestre and Bernie Ecclestone the head of the Formula One organization and presented plans for a race. Ecclestone was enthusiastic about the possibility of replacing the current Detroit Formula One Grand Prix and agreed for further meetings with Gonyea. A second meeting took place at the 1987 Detroit Grand Prix between Gonyea, Ecclestone, George Couzens, head of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), Burdie Martin, head of the Automobile Competition Committee for the US (ACCUS) and Chris Pook, Long Beach Indy Grand Prix race promoter. The \\"Phoenix Grand Prix Committee\\" was established to negotiate with Ecclestone the terms for hosting the event but one immediate problem was that Detroit had a valid contract to host the US Grand Prix until 1991.Bid for street race Mark Armijo Arizona Republic July 4, 1987 page 101 However, in October 1988, Detroit refused to invest money into improving Grand Prix facilities demanded by Ecclestone and decided to run an Indy car event instead of Formula 1 in 1989. On January 13, 1989, the Phoenix City Council headed by mayor Terry Goddard agreed to stage an annual Formula 1 race on a five-year contract. Phoenix City Council also voted to spend $9 million of taxpayers' money on race circuit infrastructure over the 5 years. It was well known to organizers that Phoenix can be very hot during summer, but nonetheless, Phoenix inherited the Detroit race's scheduled slot of June 4, 1989.New site for Grand Prix race, Observer Reporter Washington, associated press June 4, 1989 The city had only 4 months to finish the 2.36 mile long circuit. This required fencing off and repaving the road surface, as well as building grandstands, garages for the pit crew, and other infrastructure. The project was so massive that local media joked that the city looked as if it was preparing for a Soviet invasion.The Phoenix New Times, The Less Than Grand Prix by Tom Fitzpatrick Wednesday, May 10, 1989 In the inaugural race in 1989, Ayrton Senna took the pole in his McLaren-Honda but suffered an electronic failure a little over halfway through the race. The heat of the Phoenix desert was hard on teams and drivers, and only 6 of 26 cars finished. Alain Prost, Senna's teammate, won the race\\"Prost Gains 1st Victory of Year; Wins Phoenix Grand Prix\\", The Washington Post, June 5, 1989 ahead of Riccardo Patrese and Phoenix native Eddie Cheever. In an attempt to beat the scorching heat, the event date was changed to become the season opener the next year. It was held on March 11, 1990. Senna won. Jean Alesi finished 2nd. The last United States Grand Prix held in Phoenix was on March 10, 1991, with Senna again claiming victory. Again reliability was a factor, with only nine cars still running at the end of the race. For a second straight season both Tyrrells finished in the points; Stefano Modena, who had replaced the Ferrari-bound Alesi, in fourth heading Nakajima in fifth. Cancellation On August 22, 1991, Bernie Ecclestone faxed a message to the City of Phoenix indicating that the Formula 1 race would be held there on March 15, 1992.Formula one official insists firmly race will return, Mark Armijo, The Arizona Republic, August 24, 1991 page E6 On September 21, 1991, the City of Phoenix hired Buddy Jobe, the owner of Phoenix International Raceway to be consultant for the city for the next event.Drivers catch pennant fever, Mark Armijo The Arizona republic, September 21, 1991 page E7 On October 7, 1991, Ecclestone called the City of Phoenix from his London office to say that a Formula 1 race would not be returning to Phoenix; giving no explanation. Phoenix City Manager David Garcia said that Ecclestone agreed to pay the city $1.2 million for cancellation of the contract and that the reason for cancellation may have been a desire to add a South African Grand Prix since apartheid had ended. During the 1992 South African Grand Prix, Ecclestone was asked if poor attendance was to blame for the Phoenix race pull out, he said that attendance was never a problem but ability to place more than 20,000 seats in a way where fans can have a better view. Legacy On August 12, 2017 new Formula 1 boss Chase Carey criticized Ecclestone for going for too many short term deals in the USA, stating \\"You have to capture people‚Äôs imagination.
